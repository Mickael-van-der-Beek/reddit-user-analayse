1) Lots of boobs.  Gender and sexuality aside, I hope we can agree that boobs are great

2) Lots of [violence](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjQT4VkjHF4).  So many asses are kicked in this movie.

3) [Patrick Swayze](http://whatculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/patrick_swayze_94538o.jpg) is a fucking God.

4) [Sam Elliott](http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8lb1ypjuT1qfbtx3o1_500.jpg) is also a fucking God

5) [The stars of Road House sport unbelievable hairdos](http://imgur.com/taMZUYf)

6)  [A greased up shirtless Swayze does tai-chi by a river](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ju_Ph1-A6Q8)

7) The Plot is fucking insane: Swayze's character, Dalton, is the second best cooler(head bouncer/security consultant) in the business.  He is approached by a stranger to come run his shitty bar in Bumblefuck, MO.  Dalton accepts almost immediately and proceeds to drive to Missouri where he turns town upside-down by simply improving a shitty bar.  This starts a war with a crazy business mogul who owns the town.  Madness ensues.

8) [You get to see Swayze fuck Kelly Lynch to an Otis Redding song.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tw4-qjENzZQ)

9) Swayze [rips a guy's throat out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlnBvrV8IW4)

10) Swayze can [rally the motherfucking troops.]  (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTh5JzRziHE)  What a smooth operator.

We've had roughly 1500 new subscribers over the last 24 hours because of a [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1bfo42/what_is_your_favorite_so_bad_its_good_movie/c96g8pf) made in an AskReddit thread about ""What is your favorite 'so bad its good' movie?""

We're very happy to have more people to share our awful hobby with, I just wanted to take a quick moment to point out the Subreddit Rules in the Sidebar to the right.  I'm going to consider the two most important rules to be ""**Just because you didn't like a movie, doesn't mean it was bad. Please don't post links to Dances With Wolves because it didn't speak to you.**"" and ""**Please, please, please search for a previous thread on a movie before posting a new one**.""  A lot of the movies posted in the last day are movies we've already got threads for.  Feel free to join the existing discussions.  When in doubt, check the sidebar *Essential badmovies viewing list* and the linked **Extensive Google Docs List**, if the movie is listed there, a thread already most likely exists.

We'll be going through and consolidating threads to try and keep the reposts to a minimum.


That's about it.  Thank you all for your time.

*All of the lizards in the film were designed by the same guy who designed Godzilla in Roland Emmerich's adaptation

A few days ago I made [a post](http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/1jaqbb/would_anyone_be_willing_to_contribute_to_a_bad/) about an idea I had for a new magazine dedicated to the bad movies that this subreddit loves so much. I got an extremely positive reaction and a flurry of PMs from people excited about writing for the magazine.

Long story short, I think that this could be a fun project and I’ve decided to move forward with it, but I’ll need your help!

I wanted to go into detail a bit more about the magazine. First off, it’s going to be 100% free. Anyone with an iPad/iPhone can download the app and enjoy the magazine (a web version will hopefully follow shortly after). All of the content for the magazine will be user-contributed...everything from reviews, articles and regular columns.

Anything published in the magazine will be owned by the writer, although it would be appreciated if they would wait at least 30 days before publishing it anywhere else.

So, if you have any ideas for articles or columns, comment below and let us know! We can figure out how to incorporate them into the magazine!

I’ve got a few ideas for topics already. Some of these are mine and some are from the previous thread on the topic.

Even if you can’t write and you just want to help out, that would be greatly appreciated.

Please help spread the word. If you know of any other subreddits that might enjoy this type of magazine, let me know or cross-post it...I want this to be a great magazine for the whole subreddit (and everyone else who loves bad movies) to enjoy!

*****

**UPDATE:** A few people have asked about frequency of issues, so I figured I would address that. I would like for it to be a monthly. If possible, I'd like to have the first issue published by the end of August, which would give me a month to put it together. Hopefully we can get into the App Store by then. That would probably mean a deadline of three weeks from now for articles.

*****

**UPDATE 2: Electric Boogaloo (8/2):** I've decided to use Type Engine for the app. I'm currently testing and customizing the app and preloading a few articles I've written into it ([here's a sneak peak!](http://i.imgur.com/qYrHg2W.png)).

At the moment, the Apple Dev center is currently down and has been for 10 days. Once it comes back online and I can register with Apple as a developer, everything should be ready to go..we just need content.

Thanks again for the enormous response!

*****

**UPDATE 3: Update with a Vengeance (8/5):** Currently, we have 10 submissions lined up for the first review and a few for the second. Thanks for all of the help guys! I've got two reviews of my own that I'm working on, but if you have an idea for a column or a review that you'd like to write, I'm looking for content for the second issue. Drop me a message and we can work out the details!

1366997627.0,30,self.badMovies,1d5ze5,The /r/badMovies demographic and movie survey RESULTS!,ShetlandJames,35,5,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/1d5ze5/the_rbadmovies_demographic_and_movie_survey/,"Hello. I just realised the other day that my /r/badMovies survey was never resultsically shared amongst you bastards so here we are.

THINGS TO NOTE:  
- SurveyMonkey only lets you collect 100 results and there were 177. Totally lame but whatever, let's just suppose this is a reasonably accurate likeness of our members.

The first thing that we wanted to know was the **gender**ical make-up of the subreddit. [Bit of a sausage fest, really](http://i.imgur.com/ml2EAbi.png), but we all knew that anyway. We were also chasing your **age**, of course. See if we get all this personal stuff we can later blackmail you, of course. The make up is as one might expect, with [74% of us between 18 and 34](http://i.imgur.com/poDiZaP.png).

Question 3 was asking you **where you lived**. Top 3 are [US, Canada and UK](http://i.imgur.com/poDiZaP.png). We clearly need to do more recruiting in shithole countries like Malawi and France. Normally this next question would be Q3a but fuck tradition, this is Q4: If you are from the States, as I expected most users to be from (and I was right cause I have a PhD in Ass Vortexes) then you have the unbridled privilege of telling us **which state** you're in. Top 3 were [California, Pennsylvania and Washington](http://i.imgur.com/ueHUnJo.png).

Finally, I wanted to know how many of you were layabouts, so we asked you **if you work**, like, a job and shit. Turns out you lot aren't completely useless and a lot you actually [do work](http://i.imgur.com/6aSXB3B.png). That's cool. Only 11% unemployment rate, but if we combine that with student then we're up to 41% ~feral savages~ dependents.

**NOW THE ONLY THING YOU ACTUALLY CARED ABOUT: As a community, what are our favourite bad movies?**

There were hundreds of options on the list and we let people people pick as many options as they wished so percentages are pointless here. This is cold, hard, erect figures. Two ways I thought to present this:

1. [Literally ~~hitler~~ every single result](http://i.imgur.com/hKJ3SaH.png)
2. [Less screen rapingly top 20](http://i.imgur.com/mPetYkn.png)

Option 2 is better to see for sure. Let's ~~analyze~~ analyse our top 20:

For anyone unable to view Imgur at work - ~~get the fuck off reddit or you'll be fired~~ here is the top 20:

1. The Room (49 votes)
2. Troll 2 (48)
3. Birdemic (35)
4. Killer Klowns from Outer Space (33)
5. Manos: Hands of Fate (30)
6. Plan 9 from Outer Space (28)
7. The Wicker Man 2006 (26)
8. Leprechaun: In The Hood (21)
9. Mega Shark VS Giant Octopus (19)
10. Samurai Cop (18)
11. Sharktopus (18)
12. The Happening (18)
13. Hard Ticket to Hawaii (17)
14. The Stuff (17)
15. Jack Frost (16)
16. Pink Flamingos (16)
17. Zardoz (15)
18. Silent Night, Deadly Night 2 (14)
19. Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter (13)
20. Thankskilling (13)

The Room was the most popular with 49. That's every other user selecting it. A close second was Troll 2 with 48, and Birdemic was 3rd with 35. Kuriously, Killer Klowns Kfrom Kouter Kspace was 4th. I'm not sure KKfOS is actually a bad movie, but what the hey.

But hey, what about that film I like that wasn't on the list? Yes we may have missed a few films, so we added an 'other' category to the form. 133 results. I'm not going to post them all you bastards. But the most popular films missing from the list were:

* A Talking Cat?!
* Batman and Robin
* Battlefield Earth
* Blood Diner
* Death Race 2000
* Mac and Me
* Riki-Oh
* Roadhouse
* Santa Claus Conquers the Martians
* Space Munity
* Warriors

Bonus question: which films got no votes at all? The following:

* Grim Weekend (Sick Insane Clown Killer) 
* Out of Reach 
* Purani Haveli 
* Saurians 
* The Foreigner 
* The Impossible Kid 
* Three the Hard way

Last but definitely least, here are all the comments that were left on the form where we asked if we could be doing anything better:

* ""Movie of the week? A self-post that contains a link to where one can see the movie, discuss the movie in a comment thread?""
* ""Not the mods specifically, but more ""Bad Movie Nights"" would be awesome.""
* ""Get your shit together. Damnit.""
* ""r/badMovies is a great place. I think the more people that join, the more people just jump into new conversations or post weirdtastic stuff they find, the more we all benefit.""
* ""naw, ya'll are phresh""
* ""movie of the week""
* ""Maybe, but I'm not smart enough to know what it is. /r/badMovies is great!""
* ""Dunno, I'm one of the newbies.""
* ""Nope! You guys are awesome &lt;3""
* ""No, you guys are awesome!(:""
* ""You guys are pretty good.""
* ""Nope.""
* ""Themed days and maybe a ""lets all watch"" sort of deal where we all watch something.""
* ""Schedule a meet-up, now that you know where the subscribers live?"" (lol)
* ""Nope. You guys are awesome. Keep it up!""
* ""Nope. You're great!""
* ""Denny, don't plan too much. It may not come out right!""
* ""Acknowledge the greatness that is Blood Diner.""
* ""I visit casually but it seems that the posters geeeeeeeenerally do a good job of self-policing when mod action isn't necessary/forthcoming. The only suggestion I would have is that whoever put Executive Koala on this list should be very unhappy with themselves. That is a genuinely good movie that does not deserve to be in the company of something like Poochinski or Jack Frost. Pink Flamingos is probably a whole different beast, too, but I'm kind of afraid of that.""
* ""Not yet.""
* ""I'm new, what do I know? I think the sub is pretty great! Keep up the good work!""
* ""Ensure that a list, such as above, is present to avoid the over discussion of certain films. Another thing i like about bag movies is the sense of community found in watching them with other people - a live streaming of a bad film with a chat box or irc would be great""
* ""You guys are doing swell!""
* ""Nope...'tis all good.""
* ""Not that I can think of""
* ""allow more pirated material to be shared.""
* ""I am new but you seem to be doing a great job of managing it especially with all the new traffic!""
* ""Have a better reddit theme""
* ""Nope.""
* ""I don't know how reasonable this really would be, but maybe a reddit meet-up/movie night thread.""
* ""Be more sarcastic""
* ""Host a weekly discussion thread on a prearranged weekly film.""
* ""this is my favorite subreddit, keep up the good work""
* ""Not that I can think of""
* ""I love this sub!""
* ""We are perfect""
* ""I think ShetlandJames should do an AMA about how much he loves Peter Boyles' knob in Poochinski.""

""Iron Sky""",LordHellsing11,35,7,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/1dblnn/id_like_to_discuss_a_movie_i_saw_that_i_expected/,"The movie in question is Iron Sky, IMDB page: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1034314/?ref_=sr_2

I saw it on netflix and when I read the description I knew I had to watch it. It's about that Hitler established a moon base during 1945 as a contingency plan, it's now the year 2018, and they finally want to invade. Moon Nazi's motherfuckers. But then I started to watch it and very quickly it became apparent that this was not the movie I was expecting, but something far genuinely better. 

This movie is  somehow a fantastic satire of modern American and even indeed world governments, a drama dealing with interesting characters dealing with their own unique conflicts and goals, a sci-fi action adventure and a very good comedy.

 I think one of things that makes this movie works is that it understands how work with good satire. Like the movie Airplane much of the comedy works and is funny because it is people in ridiculous situations, but all of the characters are playing it completely straight.

It also has a surprising number of well down references to The Great Dictator, Downfall,  2001 A Space Odyssey, and Dr Strangelove. In fact not only are there references to Dr Strangelove, the entire movie is simply oozing with similar tone, satire, and cinematography as Dr Strangelove. If I was being completely honest, the best way I could describe this movie is that this is the  Dr Strangelove for our modern culture. 

However, as fancy as I make it seem, it still has many, many over the top ridiculous parts of a good ""so bad it's good b-movie"". Two words: Space Zeplins. Oh yea. Basically, if you have netflix consider watching this because it has all the greatness and sheer awesomeness of a bad movie, without actually being a bad movie. 

TLDR: Movie about space Nazi's is just as ridiculously awesome as it sounds, but it is also a legitly well done movie.

1372024258.0,28,self.badMovies,1gxi10,I just realised I never told you guys about the time I got to hang out with Alan Bagh (lead in Birdemic and Birdemic 2) for a few hours. Picture included.,ShetlandJames,34,6,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/1gxi10/i_just_realised_i_never_told_you_guys_about_the/,"So in May the Birdemic 2 cast and crew came over to Europe for a few movie premiers in England and France. I live in London where there was a screening. Unfortunately I was unable to attend the screening; I had a friend visiting me from New Zealand who was only going to be in London for the night and I hadn't seen her in about 8 months and didn't want to sit in a cinema - I wanted to talk to her!

Anyway I emailed Jeff Gross, Birdemic 2 producer highlighting my situation and offering him, Alan and James Nguyen (director) a tour of my work. Now, some of you may not know this but I happen to work in the [UK Parliament](http://www.jonathanedwards.org.uk/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/westminster-b.jpg) which is pretty rad. I collected them from Stratford and took them to Westminster for their tour.

I was wearing my NILBOG tshirt when I went to go see them. It turned out that James couldn't make it but Jeff said that was fortunate because he hates the association of Birdemic with Troll 2 and The Room. I would reckon that nearly every user on here considers Birdemic to be up there with Troll 2 and The Room as the greatest bad movie ever. James doesn't. James legitimately thinks that he made a good movie. 

Anyway, I bought Alan and Jeff underground day passes and we took the underground towards Westminster while I got to ask a few questions. Alan was very quiet initially. He sat on silently wearing sunglasses on the underground. Jeff was quite intense. He spoke of the difficulties that he faced as a producer and how he had retired from the business until the opportunity of Birdemic 2 came up. He was a fan of the first and provided financing for the sequel (beakqual?). A recurring theme was his insistence that I got all my friends to buy the movie. I could tell that he had probably invested a decent sum of money into the film and wanted to make back his investment. Knowing the state of the movie industry with downloads depriving non-rich guys like Jeff of money did tinge me with a morsel of guilt. I was going to buy this movie anyway.

So I took them for a tour of my work and had lunch with them. Speaking to Alan was a surreal experience. Here was a guy who delivered one of my favourite performances ever in a movie but not for the same reason that I want to speak to William Fichtner. It took me about an hour and half to get into the whole “so… you do realise why people like this movie, right?” kind of questioning. How the hell does one approach this? I had no real idea. I certainly didn’t want to offend Alan because he was a nice guy.

Alan said that when the reviews and user comments first hit, he was a little hurt because he was being described as a crappy actor, an over-actor a whatever people can think. It did make me think. We sit here laughing at these movies but these people have lives and feelings too. I write music and I do not take it seriously at all but if someone said to me that thought my jokey music was shit I would be a bit hurt. Anyway he said that he felt better when he met people like me – I guess like a lot of us on BadMovies – who have so much love for the film. It didn’t matter to Alan that the movie was infamous – people were enjoying something that he was involved in. 

We got some photos together on the roof and I got a whole bunch of signed shit – some of which I still have to give away. Can anyone think of a competition worthy of someone getting some signed Birdemic stuff?

[Here is the picture]( https://fbcdn-sphotos-e-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/461318_10201087380007857_149365203_o.jpg) that we got on the roof. I’m 6”1½ FYI. I found it fucking fantastic that if you look closely you’ll see a bird flying over Alan’s head – complete accident.

AMA? I may have missed something and a question may reignite that memory.

I promised Jeff I would so: [Please buy the movie!](https://chill.com/james_nguyen/birdemic2?autoplay=1)",,False,self,t5_2rgwi,False,,,True,t3_1gxi10,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/1gxi10/i_just_realised_i_never_told_you_guys_about_the/,moderator

It's been rather exciting recently, hasn't it? Our subreddit exploded in popularity after /u/ebonythunder linked us in a post from AskReddit, so I think it's a good time to ask ourselves the big questions: Who the fuck are we and what the shitting hell do we like?

I've put together a short, 7-question survey for anyone interested. Basic shitty questions like your gender and age are there... don't answer them if you can't be arsed. What I'm really curious to know is what particular films you guys think are the most badderest. You know, the least goodest ones. As in, which ones do you love? 

The top 10 of these will replace the 'Essential' list on the right to fairly reflect what we as a community think. Maybe top 15 if we get a load of responses.

I only like to plan to have this tomorrow at a certain time so that way people know when to join in. 

I figured since Youtube has a a lot of movies that this subreddit likes, we can have a marathon of sorts in a chatroom! It would be on the [Synchtube website](http://www.synchtube.com/) which is perfect for these kinds of things.

The marathon would consist of favorites such as The Room, Reefer Madness, and pretty much anything from the [Troma channel!](http://www.youtube.com/user/Tromamovies?feature=watch) Of course anyone who comes in may add to the list of any movies Youtube has as well (and like I said, they have a lot of free bad movies).

Anyway, after that I can't wait to watch more Sidaris selections. I was wondering if anybody here has seen them all, and could suggest the other best ones in his ""Bullets, Bombs and Babes"" series--there's a lot of movies here, with around 13 overall to choose from. I'm hoping that at least a few are on a similar level to ""Hard Ticket to Hawaii.""

* [Maniac Cop] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095583) - [Trailer] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtLOCUoz2NI)

Maniac Cop was almost too good of a movie to be labeled a ""bad movie"".  With all of its fantastic stunts and a proper story line I might have been wrong to include this on the list of for FUMN.  If Bruce hadn't been there to ham things up like only he can I wouldn't had even considered it.  Oh and the close ups on Robert Z'Dar's face were fantastic.

* [The Miami Connection] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092549) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpZu69OB2KM)

Everything you've heard about this movie is true.  Such a fun bad movie to watch.  Senseless dialog.  Fake guitar playing.  Over acting. Shirtless men.  The highlight of the night.   

* [Chatterbox] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075830) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2icTd46vcs)

I showed the trailer for this during another FUMN because I thought the premise was quite silly.  The wife liked the trailer and wanted to see the whole movie.  It wasn't too bad in a cutesy sort of way.  

* [Society] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098354) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDHzfyiZE_A)

A bit of a slow burner.  But once it draws you in and you start realizing that something is just a little off the ending smacks you right square in the face and you're left standing there wondering why your pants are around your ankles and your ass hurts.  

* [Viva] (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393956) - [Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWXwfeCpEv4)

Unfortunately we did not make it to this movie as it was getting a little late in the night.  But I've screened this movie a little bit and what I saw I really like.  They really got the feel of the era with this movie only being a couple of years old.  The acting style, set and costume design, music and everything else really does an amazing job of conveying the period.

I run a monthly Bad Movie Night out of a bar in downtown Toronto (on Sunday evenings) and I think it would be a fun experiment to see about expanding this event online. I have some questions though...

First off, is there any interest in joining us and watching from home? Would it be important that we provide a livestream of the movie(s) screened or would you still watch along even if you had to find your own copy? Aside from talking about it on this subreddit, would you want any other avenues of interactivity available (e.g an event-specific hashtag [#badmovieto] to start a twitter conversation)?

Thanks so much - I look forward to some feedback!

It started funny bad, then went to bad-bad, then straight to annoying-bad. I love bad movies - and as a child of the 80s, I *had* to watch HtD eventually - but IMO, it's not a ""good bad movie"", just a shitty big-budget Hollywood mega-flop.

4. [Turkish Star Wars](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vpq2n6eNytQ)

I'm not able to livestream the films we're watching, nor run a synchtube room, as my computer will be occupied with the screening at the bar. If there's any interest though, maybe something can be figured out in the next few hours so this subreddit can watch and chat together.

Before each movie I have trailers and other various bits of internet detritus I run across each day.  Without a doubt the biggest hit each night are the unintentionally hilarious movies.  Movies like Deadly Prey (which I showed on a early rendition of Fucked Up Movie Nights) and Samurai Cop are sure crowd pleasers, often requiring several rewinds because we are laughing too hard.  

If anyone has friends remotely interested in bad movies share them.  These gems need to be unearthed and shared with the populace.  I am still sore from the non stop laughing during Samurai Cop.

Much in the same way Reddit does not allow links to ROMS or Pirated software, we are asking you to not post links to movies you do not own the rights to.

There are two points to keep in mind:

1. If the link you are posting is to the Director/Producer/Copyright Holder's official channel or webpage, and *they've* made it available for viewing, then **that is ok and CAN be posted to r/badmovies.** (Any links to torrent sites or sketchy looking ""free movies"" website will be removed.)

2. Feel free to tell everyone where we can find a copy of the movie you're discussing.  Most of the movies talked about here on r/badmovies are available on either Amazon, iTunes, or Netflix.

www.badmoviepodcast.com is the site.  I'm hoping at least some of you are already listeners.  I think we have 10 now, so the odds are pretty good.  If you don't know what we're all about, or our terrible link to Cleveland's horror past... start with Episode #66 where I talk for a couple of hours to horror host legend Big Chuck Schodowski about why we're doing this in his honor.

Anyway, if there's anything you want to know about producing a long running podcast, the equipment we use, movies we've watched, or my 2 second cameo in Firebirds w/ Nic Cage (truth!) then ask away.

Week 1: Plan 9 From Outer Space
: 

If somebody was murdered, then there was a murderer.

Personal thoughts: Poorest quality of any movie I have ever seen. Not the funniest, but definitely worth the watch. 8.5/10.

Week 2: Shark Attack 3: Megalodon

The only thing you need in a first aid kit is a flare gun.

Personal thoughts: Personal favorite of all time. Everything about this movie went wrong in the best way possible. Plus, it has John Barrowman and his perfect improv. He was the only good actor in the movie and there is the plus of him being Capt. Jack in Doctor Who, which make it all the more delicious, and who doesn't like spontaneous softcore porn. After watching this for the 2nd time I decided to find the DVD on Amazon, worth the $16 to watch is whenever I want. 10/10


Week 3: Dungeons &amp; Dragons:

There is no better tribute to your best friend’s death than a pile of rocks.

Personal thoughts: Huge budget for an awful movie. The SFX were great, but that doesn't make up for the awful acting and the terrible writing. In my top 5 of all time. 9/10

Week 4: The Room

If you buy somebody things, they owe you their life.

While everybody else likes this one I personally don't enjoy Tommy Wiseau, but I can certainly see the appeal. I love the rest of the movie and I'm not gonna lower the rating much just because I don't like one guy. The acting was terrible, the story cliche, and the unfinished plot line are abundant. 9/10

Week 5: Troll 2

Fire extinguishers cause confusion.

Personal thoughts: Not a whole lot to say, it has everything you want in a bad movie. Comes in at #2 or #3 in my list. 10/10

Week 6: Black Dynamite: 

Donuts don’t wear alligator shoes.

Not technically a bad movie, but it is a satire of bad movies, so it loses a point for that. Very enjoyable, and a perfect copy of the blacksploitation films of the past, complete with intentional goof and overtly racist characters and writing. 7.5/10


Week 7: The House that Bleeds on Alex / Jesus Christ Vampire Hunter


There is no such thing as a shit house (and/or office).
Atheists can compact five times better than actual people.

Personal thoughts (The House that Bleeds on Alex):  Bad on purpose, so it is similar to Black Dynamite, but the fact that it is only 10 minutes long makes up for it. Everything you expect from Tommy W. (Also, if you haven't seen it the Tommy Wi-Show shorts is worth a look, but not his best work) 8/10 for The House that Bleeds on Alex and 6.5/10 for the Tommy Wi-Show




Week 8: Robot Jox: 

Russians curdle beer.

Definitely worth seeing, it is a classic early 90's action flick. Too much money on SFX and not enough on writing and actors. Horrible fight choreography and terrible writing. 8/10

Movies from outside of the club:

Sharktopus
7/10

Mega Piranha
5/10

Behemoth
3.5/10

Ice Spiders 
6/10

Sabertooth
6.5/100

Lake Placid 3
7/10

Lake Placid 2
7.5/10

Mega Snake
8/10

Rise of the Gargoyles 
7.5/10

Vipers
7/10

Wyvren 
8/10

I've seen plenty of others over the years, but I can't remember most of them very well and wouldn't feel comfortable reviewing them. Some that come to mind are Alien Apocalypse, Boa vs Python, Hammerhead: Shark Frenzy, and Raptor Island among others. 

#1 movie that isn't technically a bad movie, but is worth watching:

Dr. Strangelove

It has everything that makes a bad movie an bad movie worth watching. Ridiculous people acting seriously in a ridiculous situation which continues to get more and more ridiculous (my personal theory on what makes a bad movie). If you watch this you will end up dying of laughter at the end, but I will warn you, the first 15 minutes are incredibly dry.


I'll try to give more suggestions in the future if I can, I'm somewhat limited by what is on Netflix and what is on SYFY on Saturday night, but I will do my best. 

Scale:

7.5&lt;: Definitely worth seeing.

7.5&gt; or = and &gt;5 worth seeing if you have plenty of free time

For example, [Spoilers] there's a scene where one character, tied up with twine to a nail on the wall above her, manages to free herself just by pulling hard enough and then undoing the weak knot. I don't think I've seen a character actually escape an easily-escapable trap in a movie before without calling attention to it, and it added an unexpected realistic touch. It's also the only slasher I've seen where the killer literally murders everyone else that appears onscreen. When she approaches the final girl, she tells her ""congratulations, you almost made it,"" which I thought was nicely sort-of-but-not-really meta.[/spoilers]

 Moments like these might just stick out more in contrast with the abundant badness, but I feel like badness is, in its own way, essentially a disregard of an audience's intentions, which can sometimes lead to really unexpectedly original moments. What small elements of otherwise awful movies surprised you made you realize that someone working on it must have known what they were doing, and that you doubt could be easily found in a typically ""good"" movie?",,False,self,t5_2rgwi,False,,,True,t3_14vxny,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/14vxny/flashes_of_brilliance_in_terrible_movies/,

The lines are hilarious(ly awful), the plot makes no sense, all the characters are unlikable, and the writers managed to fuck up the huge moral at the end of the story! 

Triple Dog is filled with movie line gold like ""What's the bitchuation?"" and references to one's ""Fuckfactor"". The writers have obviously never spoken to anyone under the age of 30 as the entire script plays out as a pathetic caricature of how they must imagine teenagers speak.

Now let's talk about the overarching moral (spoilers, feel free to come back and read after watching the movie).

* What the moral is supposed to be (spoiler tag for curtosey, reading this won't necessarily ruin the movie): [spoiler](/s ""You can't hold on to your wrong doings, sometimes you need to accept responsibility and move on."") 

* What the ""moral"" actually is: [spoiler](/s ""If you take responsibility for your actions you'll be really sad, so it's better to throw a huge tantrum and make people pity you even though what you did is CLEARLY YOUR FAULT.

A handful of ""cult classics"" aside, this generally means few people ever buy them, they go out of print, and they quickly disappear into obscurity.  There are many, *many* horrible movies from the 70s, 80s, and even 90s that never had and likely never will get a DVD release.  They're not even popular enough to make it on to the usual file sharing networks.  If you wanted to see these lost turds, your only option is to scour ebay and other online shops, hoping for the chance to snap up a rare VHS copy for several times what it went for new.

Enter Cinemageddon.

Cinemageddon (CG) is a bittorrent tracker and haven for bad, old movies.  Bad and old is all they do, and they do it well.  At the moment there are nearly *ninety thousand* torrents in the database, most of which are active.  None of these are big budget or popular flicks.  They have strict rules forbidding mainstream movies, new releases, and movies that are widely available by other means.  For most of these films, this is the *only* place they can be found.  Many of the members there are serious enthusiasts that spend lots of time and money tracking down ancient tapes and foreign laserdiscs, just to spend even more time ripping, encoding and cleaning them up to make the best possible digital version of movies that looked like utter garbage even when new.  If you want the best of the worst, this is the place to go.

CG is a private tracker and invite only.  It may take some effort on your part to get in (and to maintain a good ratio once you do), but I can promise you it is worth it.  If you've heard of it, they have it.  If you *haven't* heard of it, they almost certainly have that too.  [Here's a screencap](http://i.imgur.com/pm8mP.png) of the most recent uploads, just to give you an idea.  The members are not exactly the friendly, fluffy sort.  Think of a cross between 4chan and a biker bar.  It is a wretched hive of scum and villainy, but again, it's worth it.

The rules in the sidebar say not to link directly to torrents, so I'm not even going to link to the site.  Google will guide you.  I will *not* personally be giving out invites, so please don't ask me.

My first thought was that it would be awesome for creating a magazine dedicated to bad movies, full of reviews, news, etc.

Would anyone be interested in contributing if I was to start something like this? It could be a fun little project for everyone here!

PS - I'm not trying to make money off of this, so don't worry! I'm just offering to pay for the cost to release the app if enough people are willing to contribute.

**EDIT**: Wow, I've gotten a decent amount of responses from people messaging me and replying to the thread about helping out, so I think I'm going to move forward with this. If you have any specific ideas for columns/articles, send me a message or comment below.

Oh, and I'd make sure that there was a web-based version of the articles so that those without iOS devices can join in the fun!

Can you help me track down a shocker that I've seen in the past? I saw this film whilst I was travelling in India (the only thing in English), but have no idea what it was called. My memory is a little hazy, but it was definitely awful and worthy of a place here.

Synopsis (SPOILER ALERT):
Rural US, middle of nowhere town. The mountain nearby is causing earthquakes and the like. An old chap has read some ancient texts and believes that it's the return of a historic giant monster that will end the world. In one scene the old chap and a girl are caught in a landslide and need to escape through the roof of what I think was a school room, while CO2 was filling the room, suffocating them. His son, (or the bf of his daughter or similar) was one of the few people who believed the crazy old dude, and sets about climbing the mountain to go kill the monster. 

Turns out the crazy old man was correct and the mountain turns into a monster with easily the best 'size':'money spent on CGI' ratio. I'm talking giant tentacles flailing everywhere, whole mountain moving about. Side character almost slides into the mouth from the slopes.

I don't want to spoil the ending for anyone who hasn't seen this, but can explain further for clarification. I can't remember any of the actors, but I had a sneaking suspicion the male lead was in Lost. Sadly, having never watch lost I don't know if this was true, and I couldn't spot him from the IMDB entry.

Does anyone recognise this? I would love it if you did! Thanks",,False,self,t5_2rgwi,False,,,True,t3_y79uz,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/y79uz/does_anyone_recognise_this_film_from_the_plot/,

Not sure how many folks on BadMovies know about this little ring of vloggers and artists. Their reviews are like crack to me, and quite frankly they're about 3/4 of the reason I *love* bad movies as much as I do now (with the other 1/4 being MST3K) and I'm shocked that more people don't know about them; they're the MST3K of Gen Y. Basically, here's how they work.

Each person who produces videos, known as a ""reviewer"", selects one ""nostalgic"" or otherwise little-known TV movie, special, hollywood movie, Music Video, TV show episode/series, video game, or other piece of media, and produces a ""review"" of the selected piece of media. These reviews are typically about as long as your average half hour TV show (minus commercials, so ~20-27 minutes) in which they discuss the work in question and explain whether or not they think it's worth a watch. They'll normally start from the beginning of the movie and provide some history and context to the movie beforehand, and then work their way through it systematically, playing clips from the movie and summarizing the plot as it goes along. They'll frequently stop the movie or add-in their own voiceovers in order to point out plotholes, add context, and--most importantly--crack jokes (normally in the form of references to *good* movies via the insertion of short clips from relevant scenes in those moves), or make up their own little skits. The different reviewers will often guest star in each others' reviews and sometimes they'll even do joint reviews.

What sets these reviewers aside from a lot of other forms of entertainment I've seen are two things:

First, they have a rule on the site: Once one reviewer has reviewed something, anyone else who wants to review it has to ask permission from the one who originally did it. This means that every reviewer has mostly-unique content.

Second, I feel like their critical opinions aren't based on advertising or marketing money. Every person who does reviews starts out on ""the forums"" or on their own independent sites. Every person who does reviews does it because they love doing it, and if they're lucky they get picked up, start appearing on ""the main site"", start generating ad revenue from the single skippable ad that appears before every video, and start making some money (a few of the reviewers actually do it full-time). This means that the reviews are honest and fair. There is very little bias when it comes to these guys and that's probably the thing I love the most about them. They look at all of these weird little atrophied nubs of our media culture and judge whether or not they should be cut off and forgotten or saved and remembered in all their misshapen glory (and sometimes they find some stuff that's really beautiful or heartbreaking buried in with all the crap). These guys really treat every movie with a careful critical eye. If it's good, they point it out and give credit where credit's due. If it's bad, they rip it to fucking shreds, light it on fire, snort the ashes, dance hard techno, and mercilessly joke about it the whole way through.

Please, check these guys out; they're my main source for Bad Movies, and have almost completely replaced mainstream TV viewing for me. The best part is, they go through and cut out all the boring or uninteresting parts so you're left with ""just the good parts"". You get the experience of having watched the movie in the course of about 20 minutes, you have a good number of laughs along the way, and if the movie still sounds interesting, there's still about 3/4 of it that you haven't seen so it's still worth watching (since they often times don't point out *everything* fucked up or weird in a given movie because sometimes there's just so much and they can only shoehorn so many clips into a 20-minute review).

Here's a sample of some of the reviewers and an example of the kinds of thing they tend to review, as well as an example or two. I'll confine it to just the kinds of bad movies they review just to save time and space; each one of these reviewers often has upwards of 100 videos, and in a few cases well over 200.

- [Nostalgia Critic](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic) (mostly  80's and 90's TV shows and Movies you remember from your childhood if you're in your 20's or 30's, such as Ferngully, Kazaam, the Super Mario Bros. Movie, Secret of Nimh, etc.)
- [Nostalgia Chick](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/team-nchick/nostalgia-chick) (same as the Nostalgia Critic, but focused on ""girly"" stuff from that time, like Jem &amp; the Holograms, Disney's Hercules, the Babysitter's Club, etc.)
- [TheSpoonyOne](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/spoonyone/reviews) (A lot of Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and Action B-Movies from the 70's and 80's, as well as modern Video Game movies. Examples include: Dead or Alive, Mazes &amp; Monsters, Highlander 2, Clones of Bruce Lee, etc.)
- [Film Brain](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/fbv/bmbe) (A British reviewer, has a series called ""Projector"" where he reviews terrible movies that are in theatres in the UK around the time each episode is released, and another called ""Bad Movie Beatdown"" where he picks apart the movies from the last two decades or so that everyone forgot about a few months after they were released. Examples include: Gamer, 2 Fast 2 Furious, Paul Blart: Mall Cop, Arthur Christmas, etc.)
- [ObscurusLupa](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/ol/olp) (Does a lot of cheesy 70's and 80's horror flicks, along with a whole subseries of low-budget action movies from the 80's and early 90's starring Cynthia Rothrock; also has a series called ""Manic Episodes"" where she reviews the worst or weirdest episodes of various well-known series. Examples include: The PeeWee's Playhouse Christmas Special, the entire ""Howling"" series of werewolf movies, ""Married with Fishsticks"" aka the worst episode of Xena ever, The Fly 2, etc.)
- [MikeJTV](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/teamt/mjtv/ss) (another British reviewer, reviews a lot of modern monster movies, as well as a series called ""Shameful Sequels"" where he reviews the poorly-done sequels to well-received movies. Examples include: Santa Clause 2 &amp; 3, Ace Ventura Jr., Megashark vs. Giant Octopus, etc.)

There are about a dozen more reviewers like this who review movies, comic books, Anime, D&amp;D products, TV, Pop songs, video games, and almost every kind of media under the sun, and even the one's I've listed review a lot of other things (SpoonyOne does a *ton* of old PC Roleplaying game reviews as well as old FMV game reviews, for one, and there's a whole affiliated ring called ""Blistered Thumbs"" that's primarily for reviewing Video Games both retro and modern). Please, these guys are awesomely motivated and talented artists and entertainers who love doing what they do, are good at it, and deserve some respect. Please check them out; you won't be disappointed. 

I'd recommend starting with the Nostalgia Critic's reviews. He's the Flagship reviewer for the site, the one who's been doing them the longest, and established a lot of the ""format"" that's now used by the other reviewers.

To start with (since the choice seems fitting), [here's the Nostalgia Critic's review of *The Room*](http://thatguywiththeglasses.com/videolinks/thatguywiththeglasses/nostalgia-critic/25743-the-room).",,False,self,t5_2rgwi,False,,,True,t3_o2tj7,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/o2tj7/thought_id_share_my_favorite_way_of_finding_bad/,

1339768860.0,7,self.badMovies,v3f6y,"I see a lot of ""worst movie ever"" posted here, but nothing is even close to After Last Season",candre23,10,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/badMovies/comments/v3f6y/i_see_a_lot_of_worst_movie_ever_posted_here_but/,"This movie almost defies explanation.  It's worse than Troll 2.  It's worse than The Room.  It's worse than 90 minutes worth of infomercials.  It's even worse than Birdemic.  You can't even claim ""it's so bad, it's good"", because it's worse than that.  It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  There's no humor, not even in the badness.  I've seen test patterns with more entertainment value.

Obviously, the budget was zero.  The actors are probably friends of the ""director"", with no ability to emote, or even remember their lines.  The sets consist of a basement storage area, several rooms in a residential home, and a parking lot.  At one point, what is obviously a 2nd floor bedroom (complete with ceiling fan) is purported to be a hospital.  The only indication of this is an MRI machine made of cardboard and butcher paper, and several medical-scan-looking printouts taped to the wall.

The plot is indecipherable, if it exists at all.  Almost the entire movie consists of people walking from room to room, sitting and talking for a while about mundane aspects of their boring lives, and then leaving.  There was no attempt made to edit the footage - obvious line flubs, people tripping over the ""set"", and the camera operator falling asleep and failing to follow the ""actors"" are all kept in the final cut.  The sound editing is even worse.  They couldn't be bothered to mic anybody, so the on-camera mic was used.  There are entire scenes where you cannot really hear the dialog, and other scenes where ambient noise drowns out what dialog you can hear.

Oh, and the best part?  There is a good 15 minutes right in the middle that is computer-animated.  Though the term ""computer-animated"" is probably giving you the wrong idea.  It was created on a computer, but it is not anything sensible or related to the story.  It appear to be an abstract screensaver generated on an Amiga.  It goes on for so long that it *almost* starts to be funny, but then it just gets stupid again.

This isn't the sort of movie you get drunk and laugh at.  It's the sort of movie you watch when you hate yourself and you're working up to suicide.  It's the sort of movie that convinces you that humanity is doomed and life is not worth living.  You have been warned.

[Here's the trailer](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPPRB6ErOIU), which barely hints at the true wretchedness of the film.

[Here's the iRiff](http://www.rifftrax.com/iriffs/spoony-experiment-after-last-season), which is the only way to watch this monstrosity without chewing off your own face in despair.

SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

My reviews of the worst shit horror has to offer, so you don't have to.

This is a format I use for reviewing awful movies because

1) I am too lazy to write full, coherent reviews

2) I forget details immediately after seeing them

3) My reactions as I watch the movie seem to be the funniest parts.

This is how I usually review movies, but half the time I'm too lazy or don't have the time to jot my reactions down as I go, having to pause, rewind, etc.

So here in a jumbled mess of words and nonsense is my review for the abysmal JURASSIC SHARK.

Enjoy.

---

1 min 10 sec intro explaining what a megalodon is.  

Two bimbos can't act for shit

Given terrible dialogue/manage to make characters even dumber with natural talent

Take clothes off down to bikinis and layout on beach 

Jim Wynorski movie?  Nope.  No silicone.

Glasses and white jackets = professionals

Hallways like a motel

Cliche bull dialogue from every Syfy movie

Totally stupid yknow?

Yknow yknow ynow?

Giant clipboard + glasses + white jacket = super professional 

Motel stairway dramatic scene

""You're drilling too deep.""

I wish this was a Wynorski movie

Stock sound fx + awful cg smoke = huuuuge explosion.

Totally yknow totally

Water fight.  5 year olds in sexy 20 year old bodies

THAT WATER FIGHT JUST LASTED EXACTLY 64 SECONDS.  HOLY FUCK.

09:38 - Title card.

Why the fuck do movies take so long to show the damn title anymore?

Opening credits = 2 min 22 seconds 

My god.

No shark no gore no nudity no luck

Meet the badguys.  Back story is told bc showing it would cost $20.

Black clothes = bad guys

She's a bitch.

Stole a painting.  Better be of a shark.  And it ages forever keeping the shark young.

More ""shark"" pov.

Water escape.  Smart.

From the pov the shark is apparently doing barrel rolls... CONSTANTLY.

Another attack.  No shark no blood no gore no point.

More bimbos in bikinis.  Two tan,  one so pale she's blinding the sun.

Oh bad guys are on land now, perfectly fine.

Go in and fetch it.  Good plan.

So they saw a shark.  Take their word for it.

Oh that one guy did die.  They act like it's nothing.

Guy is walking right back into the lake.  Christ.

19:25 - Oh fuck.  Far away cg shot of a cardboard cutout.

I mean Shark.  

If that's a megalodon and suppose to be 52 feet long then fuck my eye sight.

Oh.

Bad guy in black stands in waist deep water.  Shark who is now possibly the size he should be jumps up, roars like a lion as all sharks do and eats the guy before swimming away all the while still completely submerged in the WAIST DEEP FUCKING WATER THOUGH IT'S SUPPOSEDLY 52 FUCKING FEET LONG.

And the CG is what you'd expect from a SyFy original.  But worse.

What?  This isn't a SyFy original?

Oh fuck even they wouldn't... sink... this... forget it.

Did I mention the reactions from his teammates?  Oh that's bc there were none.

New bimbos on the lake now.

Chick with massive 80s curly hair has a man face.  I think it's Richard Simmons.

They keep using white flashes between ""shark footage.""

Oh Fuck it's doing barrel rolls again.

People flopping in water to stock music with constant flashes = seizure.

I mean shark attack.

How did they all get on land?

Random guy is dead bc he seemed half intelligent and that ruined the theme.

Bimbos see terrible leg prop.

""Is that Mike?""

Fuck.

Bimbos meet bad guys.

Oh god Richard Simmons face.  Ugh.

Same three shots of shark swimming around used over and over.

They're talking about nothing... forever.

Fade to black open on red filtered stock sunset fade to black open on red sky becoming blue WHITE FLASH.

Isn't this a killer shark movie?  With the play on words its not even a Jurassic Park ripoff which would be great.  They seriously have no budget no idea what they're doing making this up as they go and nothings happening nothings happening NOTHINGS HAPPENING HAPPENING HAPPENING FUCKING NOTHING WALKING WALKING WALKING WALKING---

...

WALKING WALKING WALKING WALKING WALKING.

5 hour walk on the beach is what they said.  Take shortcut to avoid the no shark.  They weren't kidding.  Feels like 5 hours.

THEY WALK FROM 29:25 UNTIL 31:55 WITH NO DIALOGUE AND NEVER STOP WALKING UNTIL 34:03.

ALMOST 5 MINUTES OF WALKING.

SHARK OF THE RINGS. 

They finally find a building and go ape shit like they've never seen their friends garage before.  I mean in real life that's what it looks like.

Fuck.

Bad guys whisper so low I can't even make it out.  Pretty sure they didn't know their lines.

Professional doctor janitor lies outside with blood on jacket.  Oh he's fine.

Shark cut off any means of escape.  HOW?

Bad guys force dr. Janitor to walk into water.  Being the smartest person here and an expert on the shark he complies and is eaten right away.  By eaten I mean terrible cg shark opens mouth at camera and nothing is seen.

Jesus christ.

So many Canadian accents.  Shudder.

Roid rage bad guy is going roid retard.

Slow motion run scene for 7 seconds.  White flash.  Stop say line.  WHITE FLASH.  Run slomo for 14 more seconds.  WHITE FLASH.  Slomo ""fight"" scene with Roidy.  I stopped caring.

Waist deep water shark attack 2.

CRUNCH.

Oh fuck.  We're only 43 mins in?

BTW everything was in slomo from 40:40 to 42:35.

Night time.  Talking talking talking.

Day.

Dynamite something about dynamite.

""Frying pan.  Fire.""

She smart is.

Shark having a blast in choppy water.

Roidy derp throws dynamite in water.  Shark does a perfect 180.  Don't think it even turned.  Its face and ass literally morphed into eachother.

50:25 - 51:00 epic slomo walking taking shirts off revealing bikinis they've worn the whole movie.  Nudity would save this piece of shark shit but no we don't even get that.

Girls walk into water.

Roid herp the derp throws another piece.

Possibly same exact shot.

Very small shark continues to swim around aimlessly.

Bitch with gun vs shape shifting shark?  Id rather get shot.

SAME DYNAMITE THROW SAME SHARK 180 SHOT.

Roidy threw stick too late and blew himself up.  Award winning fx.

Richard Simmons face gun vs bitch gun.

Bad guy who isn't dead gets eaten by shark.  By that I mean it chews violently at the camera with no body no blood no gore no give a fuck to the audience.

Okay.

Um.

I'm going to explain this.  Try.  To explain this.

Somehow seconds before this happens the two not dead bimbos apparently know it's about to happen.

Shark gets... running start and uh... jumps out of the water roaring like a lion... soars over the two bimbos in slomo just to kill the bitch with gun.  Why ignore the two bimbos and put all that effort to get the food furthest away?  Nevermind the HOW I want to know the WHY GOD DAMNIT.

If the shark was 52 feet and could do this it would have fallen on and killed EVERYBODY.

Did I mention the shot goes from the shark over the two bimbos to bitch looking up to the shark landing back in the water?

THE SHARK FLEW

ATE THE BITCH

THEN ROTATED OFFSCREEN IN THE AIR

AND LANDED BACK IN THE WATER.

The bitch is gone except her feet.

If we stay on land we'll be safe.

DID THEY NOT JUST SEE THAT

Her face gets uglier every shot.

Bimbo 1 goes into water bleeding to attract shark.  Bimbo 2 throws dynamite.  Shark eats it.  Blows up.  Bimbo 1 doesn't die.  They walk away.

Random family drinking by water.  Canadian accents grate my ears.

Shark roars like a lion horizontally across screen eating them.

The end.

Wait.

One hour.  Two minutes.  Twenty-two seconds.

The movie is only an hour long.

The end credits go at a snails pace making it 1 hour 15 minutes 18 seconds.

Take out the intro the opening and ending credits and even being generous by leaving the endless walking and slomo scenes in and this movie is only... 59 mins long.

50 mins minus walking and slomo.

Holy fuck.

Even the worst shit shark movies run at 90 mins approx. without that much padding.

I love terrible cg shark movies but this wasn't even that.  You see the shark in all its different shapes and sizes for less than 5 mins total out of the 59 min running time.  The rest is filler very few lines and those have no meaning.  No real plot no character development friends and family die and people shrug it off and fuck fuck Fuck FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK---

It's hilarious. The acting is over the top/terrible and the plot doesn't make any sense. Expect to see protestors against killing zombies, a cult trying to help the zombies end the world, and lines like ""Naw man, I'm a zombie now"". The story focuses on a ""Zombie Squad"" trying to stop an evil cultist plot. The only redeeming part of this film is the makeup/gore and unintentionally hilarious dialogue. Sam Rami also had some sort of tenuous role in the production of this film. I wouldn't put too much stake in that though. He had his name removed from the credits.
