1343076899.0,54,self.Bluegrass,x1ad6,Played bluegrass at a wedding - suprised at the reception,banjoman74,63,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/x1ad6/played_bluegrass_at_a_wedding_suprised_at_the/,"A very nice experience I thought I would share. Forgive me for the length (and the bad pun).

We were hired to perform this past weekend in a small town called Elko BC (near Fernie). The Friday night we performed at a community hall and then Saturday we played a wedding. The father of the bride is a huge fan, and he's wanted us to play in his community for about three years. I informed him we would love to play for the wedding, but we aren't a dance band. He said that was fine. We could have dance music after the performance (his daughter and friends are in their late 20s). Keep in mind that I asked the daughter what kind of music she would like for the dance portion of the evening (I was putting it into my ipad) and she said very little country - focus on current dance music with some 80s and 90s - as long as it's dance music. I can not emphasize enough that this was not a bluegrass crowd - for most this was their first experience hearing a live bluegrass band.

So we played background music, played for the bride walking down the aisle, played background music (a lot of fiddle tunes) while people milled around. Then right after supper we played a full set of bluegrass music for the crowd while they ate desserts and plates were cleaned. Then I hooked up my ipad with appropriate dance music for the rest of the evening and we were ready to sit and enjoy the evening.

So it was a typical wedding dance. Most of the guys were outside drinking and enjoying the beautiful evening. Most of the girls were on the dance floor dancing to 80s, 90s and current rock and hip-hop. At about 11:00 the father asks us if we would be willing to do another set. I said ""I'm really not comfortable breaking up the dance music to play bluegrass."" Now at this point the crowd is really into dance music (think Katy Perry, LMFAO, Rhianna). He says the bride would really like us to play. Thinking that it was more the father wanting us to play, I asked the bride. She informed us she was hoping we would do another set, and that her friends would love to have us play, but that in no way should we feel obliged. I told her we'd do a short, quick set.

Well we get on stage to massive cheers. The groom heads outside and tells his friends that band is back on stage. We start playing ""Washington County Breakdown"" and EVERYONE is on the floor dancing. We keep kicking off tunes and everyone is dancing and drinking and cheering - pumping their arms in the air. It was very surreal. We do about an hour. Our bass player is starting to nod off a little at this point, and I figure the guests will be ready to go back to the music they're more familiar with, so we play one last song. A friend of the bride comes up as we're just putting our instruments away and asks us if we know any Paul Simon. Our mandolin player knows a few Paul Simon songs, so he picks one with two chords. I say I'll stay up with him so he's not all by himself and we'll do one more song for the bride. Halfway through our fiddle player comes back on and our guitar player picks up bass. The bride and her friend join us on stage and dance beside us. Then someone asks us to play ""Wagon Wheel."" And our encore turns into another mini-set.

I love moments like that as a musician. They're completely spontaneous, and it is just so amazing to know that you played a part to make someone's special day that much more special.

**tl;dr**  expecting to play background music at a wedding, end up bringing down the house playing bluegrass.",,False,,t5_2qk44,False,,,True,t3_x1ad6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/x1ad6/played_bluegrass_at_a_wedding_suprised_at_the/,

Here is a list of songs players should know if they're going to jam. Each area will have regional songs, but if I sat into a jam, I would expect to be able to play these songs without too much difficulty. These aren't beginning songs, so I'm avoiding songs like Cripple Creek and Will the Circle...

   I was included on a kickstarter invitation for a new project involving unreleased recordings by Doc and his family over several decades. There are several very rare cuts of Doc, including some original rockabilly-style tunes. They are just over a third of the way funded with under a month to go. Donation levels include a number of doc-owned and used pieces that you are unlikely to find anywhere else. I am not affiliated with this project, but hope that they can get this project released.

Perhaps they've been inspired by Old Crow Medicine Show, Trampled by Turtles or a performance of ""Down in the Willow Garden"" and now they come here.  The front page is not a great place for an introduction to bluegrass, although it is a great place to find an exceptional performance like Greensky Bluegrass's ""Jaywalking"".

I've listed a handful of songs to get the conversation going.  If we can come up with 10 or 15 songs I'll pin it to the sideboard for new users.  

**Bluegrass:**

* Bill Monroe - Blue Grass of Kentucky - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffhqOy_A8KM
* Flatt and Scruggs - Foggy Mountain Breakdown - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=APl9fRFmdC0
* Stanley Brothers - If we never meet again - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isfHn37cXi4
* Ralph Stanley - I'll fly away - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s1TyKl27jEg&amp;feature=BFa&amp;list=PL9169A69F35DC4C1E

**Newgrass:**

* Old Crow Medicine Show - Wagon Wheel - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gX1EP6mG-E

**Edit** Finished the second draft (excluding formatting edits).  It only incorporates the lightwolfcavalry suggestions for Albums and banjoman74 suggestions for songs.  I'll get the other suggestions in.

Grier is the man!,lukeman3000,17,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/1hh8c7/d_grier_is_the_man/,"Not too long ago, I posted on this subreddit asking if anyone knew where I could find tablature for a song named ""Tarnation"". Originally written by Don Reno, David Grier did an arrangement of it on his Lone Soldier cd that I really like.

But, I couldn't find the tabs. I saw that there was a tablature book in existence for the Lone Soldier cd, but I saw a forum post where someone explicitly said it didn't contain Tarnation, the one real reason I was going to buy the book.

Well, I emailed Mr. Grier himself and got a reply in short order. He told me that Tarnation was in there and I replied telling him about my concern that Tarnation wasn't included. He asked for my phone number and not 5 minutes later I was talking to the man himself!

He seemed like a really laid-back guy. One of the first things he said was about Tarnation - ""I said it was in there -- it's in there!"" He wasn't mad or anything. He went on to explain that there were actually two different versions of that book out there, and the first version actually didn't include Tarnation. So the forum post I had found wasn't completely.. unfounded.

Long story short, I purchased the tab book and his Lone soldier cd and just [got it today!](http://imgur.com/a/c05Mj) Can't wait to learn Tarnation and some of the the other songs on this awesome album. Also, the experience of getting to talk to Mr. Grier was really cool in and of itself, because I have a lot of respect for his craft.

Anyways, just thought I'd share this story because someone might appreciate it here. A lot of my friends don't listen to bluegrass much less know who David Grier is (heck, I didn't until not too long ago), but I certainly do now.",,False,,t5_2qk44,False,,,True,t3_1hh8c7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/1hh8c7/d_grier_is_the_man/,

1368294902.0,18,self.Bluegrass,1e4zrn,58957 - Tony Rice's Guitar (the story as I know it),banjoman74,20,2,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/1e4zrn/58957_tony_rices_guitar_the_story_as_i_know_it/,"I know Fretboard Journal a while back did a story on Tony Rice's (or Clarence White's) guitar. I thought I would tell the story as I know it.

Roland and Clarence were in McCabe's in Los Angeles where they spotted a prewar D28 Martin guitar in the corner. It was... to say the least... in rough shape. It had no fretboard and the soundhole had been enlarged. The top had been sanded extremely thin and there was no pickguard, but it was a prewar D28. (The previous owner was a woman with polio - the guitar had been lying around her house for a while and she traded it).

Clarence and Roland went home and told their dad all about the guitar. They went in together and ended up buying the guitar for $35.00 (Roland says $25). Clarence's father had McCabe put a Gretsch fretboard on the guitar. And McCabe told Clarence and Roland that they would have to use light strings on it since the top was so shaved. They brought it home and instantly put heavy strings on it, causing the top to lift. They brought it back into McCabe's, who shook his head and fixed the guitar.

Clarence had a love-hate relationship with the guitar. It was extremely temperamental. They got so frustrated with it one time they shot it with a BB gun. For flatpicking, Clarence preferred a 1952 Martin D18 that was eventually stolen from him. But Roland insisted that the D28 was the nicest rhythm guitar he had ever heard. Clarence eventually got rid of the guitar in 1965, preferring to play A Roy Noble custom built guitar (#69). He even played a Guild during a period.

In 1975 Tony Rice was able to track down 58957. He bought the guitar for $550 from Joe Miller in Pasadena California. It was almost unplayable. Tony had a bunch of work done on it... and there are a lot of rumours surrounding the guitar. The main one is that he got the top completely redone with all the marks, scratches and even the BB gun dent (Roy Noble has been connected with this work). Roland believes he had this done (as he saw the guitar was strung with heavy strings, and he knew that top wouldn't support it). Tony denies it. There is also a rumour the neck is actually off an OM. This one is untrue. It supposedly plays like an OM neck as the neck has, at one time, been shaved down. Tony says the only major repairs, besides refrets and neck adjustments, were done in 1981 - a crack in the side of the guitar was repaired and the bridge was replaced (by Hideo Kamimoto in California).

That was until 1993. The guitar was involved in a flood (in fact... floating in Tony's living room). Chris Martin and Mike Longworth with Martin offered to fix the guitar, but Tony trusted his long-time repairman Harry Sparks from Ohio to fix it. The guitar was in ROUGH shape however, and was essentially a poor sounding guitar during this time frame. After it had dried and recuperated, Tony was willing to play the guitar again.

I have had a chance to talk to some people who have played the guitar (I have not). They say it is a temperamental beast. But, when you do pick it just in the right spot, the sound is amazing. And Tony does know how to pick it right.

So, that's the story as I know it. Tony released a CD a few years back titles 58957. I highly recommend it for a chance to hear the guitar in action.

I saw them live at a bluegrass festival shortly after they put out their first album, and from that moment my perspective on music was fundamentally changed. And I've never heard anything else like them. I know that since they've gone their separate ways they've been putting out stuff separately, but none of it comes close to the quality of the material they put out when they were together. And it's not as if the quality was declining - some tracks from their last album still give me chills.

I just booked my plane, and will be in Nashville on the 18th of September, going back home for the holidays in December.

Are there anyone in the area wanting to play, jam, hang out or meet up?
 
I play three finger style five string banjo, mainly in the genres bluegrass, newgrass, a bit of jazz, that sort of stuff, and my main influences are Fleck, Trischka, Cavanaugh, Cloud etc.

Please let me know if you're interested, I don't know anyone when I go over there so a couple of friendly faces would be awesome.

I'm planning on going to the World of Bluegrass, which events should I attend there?

It's by a black metal band, so using them as a starting point is a dead end.

Edit:  Thanks for all the responses.  I'll check out all of the recommendations and reply in more detail.  I didn't expect so many and such good responses.  Great subreddit.  Also, I get the feeling there is a history of people thinking anything with a banjo is bluegrass.  I'm not sure that's what I was doing.  I think I was just confusing folk for bluegrass.  I thought bluegrass was a subgenre of folk.  It was more the fiddle and strong boot-stomping beat, anyway.

First, some history. I'm a classically trained violinist, 15 years playing, have sat pretty high up with a few symphony orchestras (one of them professional), played for musicals, operas, etc. etc. But I think I'm ready to move on from that life. My real passion is being able to get ""off the page,"" if you will, and move into the world of real bluegrass fiddling. I've been listening to a ton of music that is so far outside of my comfort zone lately (Ralph Stanley, Nickel Creek, Chris Thile), but I'm finding that...I sort of like it. I like it a lot, in fact. 

So, coming from the world of classical violin, and moving into more of a 4- or 5-part bluegrass band, where do I even start with getting resources? I'm used to spending 3-5 hours in a practice room daily, so there's no hesitation on my part to put in the work, I just don't know what to work *on*. I have a book of fiddle tunes, and that's nice to play through for stylistic things, but it also feels like that's reinforcing my habit of being entirely stuck in the music, not able to really get out of it. Where do I start?

**tl;dr**: Classical violinist wants to move into the world of Bluegrass. Needs help finding resources on how to start moving in that direction.",,False,,t5_2qk44,False,,,True,t3_k5xw3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/k5xw3/how_to_make_the_violin_switch/,

We had a pretty good response so more than likely have more musicians than we can use on one track.. we'll just have to do lots more!

It was suggested that we start with a traditional tune, and nine pound hammer was thrown out there. This is a standard tune that has instrumental breaks as well as vocal opportunities. I'm looking into the best way to provide storage for our projects. MediaFire looks pretty good. I'll update with more info soon.

If you'd like to contribute please use [this mediafire folder](http://www.mediafire.com/#rq0t7a4h3vm49) to drop zipped copies of your tracks and please do increment the version. For instance we'll start with v1, the next person to upload please name your file with v2 and I'll update below to link to it. If you'd like others to listen please use something like soundcloud and provide a link to your mix.

*edit*: I guess I could include the name of the recorder. It's a [ZOOM H2n(http://www.zoom.co.jp/products/h2n/). It has four different settings for recording. The nice one for this recording was a 360 degree, 4 channel recording. I was able to take the two stereo tracks in Garage Band to get the recording, if that makes sense.

I **love** listening to bluegrass and watching people play. I'm a noob at fiddle, but I can sing along to hundreds of songs. :-)

My home was built to be an event venue. I've got a huge outdoor deck, and a big open floorplan inside.  Also, things are good &amp; spread out here, so no neighbors are going to be bothered by the sound whether we play inside or outside.

I'm thinking it would be once a month, maybe on the first Sunday or something, starting at around 3pm? 

my questions:

1. What would you expect if you came to a person's house to jam?  Can I just put out iced/sweet tea and let people know to bring whatever else they want to drink? Would you expect there to be food, or can I ask people to bring some kind of snack to share?  

1. I plan to run an ad on the radio, and in the newspaper (swap &amp; shop free ads), and send a PDF or mail a flyer to everyone in a 60 mile radius who is a fiddle/mandoline/guitar/etc. instructor... can you think of anywhere else I should advertise?

If you're from /r/folk, welcome!*

So we're all here because we love bluegrass/folk, right? And the best way to hear music is to hear it live, right? 

I'm planning my summer out, and really want to make it to some good festivals this year. Only problem is... Telluride sold out, RockyGrass is about to sell out, and honestly I just don't have much money to be travelling to these high-dollar shows.

So here's my thought. There are small bluegrass/folk festivals all over the place. These places, in my opinion, have an amazing vibe and amazing musicians. And honestly I think they have a certain something about them that is lost at the larger festivals. Unfortunately these usually have terrible promotion, and unless you are from the area you will never know about them. 

So let's use Reddit to solve that problem. List where you are, and give us info on the great festivals that are in your area. Hopefully it will help everyone find some artists they didn't know about, and maybe even some new friends.

We mostly have links to videos or soundclips posted. I don't know how many musicians we have on here versus non-musician fans, but would anyone be interested in doing some collaborations?

Of course this would just be for fun, and to perhaps strengthen the subreddit. Maybe we could investigate how we might use a service like [Indaba Music](http://www.indabamusic.com/) to achieve the collaborations?

I personally do lead and tenor vocals, guitar, fiddle (primary instrument), and a little mandolin .. I'm setup with Cubase, but I believe there are some generic formats we could use to pass around collaborations. It would be great if we could somehow tag a post as a collaboration thread and then maybe use the free version of GitHub to facilitate versions and forks of the recordings?

Thoughts?

Edit: Assuming we get enough interest to move on this, any thoughts on proceeding? My suggestion would be once we have a list of users and their instruments/vocals.. we could kick around a song and come up with a key, rhythm and ideally break orders.

There's something about the way Aoife sings that's just so immediate and compelling that I can't get enough; and the instrumentation is great, too. I'm also quite enjoying Punch Brothers, though they can get a bit histrionic at times. Trampled by Turtles, Yonder Mountain String Band, and some of the higher quality Del McCoury recordings are also quite enjoyable.

I suppose this means I'm finding the newer stuff more agreeable so far.  I think what gets me the most is melancholy fiddle and banjo playing, followed by more rollicking and complicated full band stuff.

Any further recommendations will be taken to heart and much appreciated, and it seems like I need to continue exploring from a point based in bluegrass' more modern incarnations.",,False,,t5_2qk44,True,,,True,t3_jx5sv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/jx5sv/getting_into_bluegrass_phase_2/,

For years we were focusing on [more traditional bluegrass music](https://soundcloud.com/thebixmixboys/big-spike-hammer), including [originals, with a focus on Canadian content](http://youtu.be/UhhIwFgg1CI) but it seems like the market is simply dead for that genre right now. However, it does seem to be a lot more lively for ""progressive bluegrass"" or whatever title you want to give it.

It almost feels like we should completely abandon the traditional route of bluegrass and focus more on the progressive stuff. [Here's a version of Across the Great Divide"" we recorded in our bass player's living room](https://soundcloud.com/thebixmixboys/across-the-great-divide). Additionally, [here's an original tune from our mandolin player](https://soundcloud.com/thebixmixboys/grass-could-not-be-greener)

I'm almost thinking even these ones are still too traditional, and we should be moving more towards the Mumford &amp; Sons/Trampled By Turtles route and we would be playing more shows. 

It's frustrating as hell submitting and knocking on doors and having nothing to show for it. It's poor incentive to be practicing every week and getting nothing to show for it. Or maybe I'm just a whiner and need to suck it up.

Thanks for listening to the vent.",,False,,t5_2qk44,False,,,True,t3_160vdz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Bluegrass/comments/160vdz/frustrated_and_trying_to_think_of_what_to_do_with/,
