Today was truly one of the best days of my, admittedly short, life. 70 years ago, my grandmother was forced to flee Germany during the Nazi regime because of her Jewish ancestry, even though she herself was Christian. For most of my life I grew up with German traditions, but always thought I could never be accepted as a German even though I felt a strong bond with Germany. A few months ago my mother and I applied for German citizenship through article 116(2) of German Basic Law. After a while we got a letter from Germany saying our application had been approved. I was overjoyed. Today, my mother and I went down to the German consulate and picked up our Einbürgerungsurkunden. We went to my grandmother's house to show her, and we took this picture: http://i.imgur.com/az2FG.jpg

When I showed my grandma the flag, she said, ""Schwarz, rot, gold! I used to love that flag! I had it hanging in my bedroom. I always knew that was the real Germany - a democratic Germany."" Even after being forced out of her own country, when I ask her what she thinks of Germans she says ""honest, good people"" and ""a country that gave me the best childhood one could imagine - until the Nazis came"". Although she feels she is too old to go through the application process herself (she's 93), she couldn't be happier that her daughter and grandson have become German citizens. And I couldn't be any happier either.

TL;DR: My grandma fled Germany during the Nazi regime and despite everything she still loves Germany and was thrilled that her family had become German citizens.

1329951435.0,134,self.germany,q1lo9,It's the little things (differences between living in the US and Germany),leechnerd,152,18,319,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/q1lo9/its_the_little_things_differences_between_living/,"I'm an American and I've been living in Germany for nearly a year and a half now. Life here in Germany isn't really that much different for me from life in the US. Most of the differences really are just tiny or little things that I've gotten used to and/or take for granted.

Here are some of them, maybe some Americans/Germans would find it interesting, especially cause I see some posts asking about what it's like over here. These aren't meant to be taken too seriously or as a definitive guide or anything, just my take on them.

**Home**

Windows. They open in two ways; tilt it back from the top to let in air, or swing it open from the side to open the whole thing. In the US, they slide to the side.

I'm not sure if closets physically built into the room are common here; people just have wardrobes. In the US, every room I can think of has a closet built into some section of the wall with sliding or deal doors.

**Groceries**

Shopping carts are locked and require a deposit to unlock it. Shopping carts in the US are free to take. The ones here can also be pushed in all directions (i.e., left and right too), while in the US you can only push them forward and backward. This was the strangest thing to get used to IMO.

Eggs come in cartons of 6, or cartons of 10. Why not 12? Who knows. Eggs are also not washed here, so don't be surprised if you see dried feathers stuck to the side of the egg. In the US they come in cartons of 6 (I think), 12, or more, and are washed.

Bags cost money, so people generally bring their own bags or backpacks. In the US, bags are free and plentiful, and are way thinner.

Americans are used to looking for milk in the refridgerator. You can find such milk in the fridge here too, but I'd say most people buy this ""utra-pasteurized"" milk which come in cardboard cartons and is unrefridgerated. Unopened, it can last ages, but once opened, of course you put it in the fridge. I find this milk tastes much better. Milk also comes in 1.5% and 3.5%.

I've seen refrigerator packages of food such as ""American Hotdogs"" which is like a hotdog in a bun with onions and ketchup prepackaged. (Side note, our ""American"" hotdogs are more like the sausages that come in the glass jars over here).

**Restaurants**

You're expected to seat yourself. You really do just walk in the door and find a table to sit down at and do it. In the US, you just stand by the entrance and just wait until a specific employee, usually a hostess, seats you.

At McDonalds (for example), you order your hamburgers and then you stand there in front of the cashier and wait. In the US, they'll take your name and call you when your food is ready, so you can go sit down or stand out of the way of people ordering.

Drinks do not come with free refills here. Most places in the US will happily refill your drink until you burst. In popular restaurants in the US they typically won't even ask if you want a refill and just bring you another cup when they see you're like 2/3 done with your current one. This applies to tea, soda, water, but not alcohol of course.

Here the waiters typically won't ever ""bother"" you. They'll just take your order, bring you your food, and when it looks like you're done eating they come and ask if you're finished. In the US, they're more personal and come by every so often to ask how it tastes, if they could bring you anything (e.g., more sauce), if you want to try anything else, deserts, etc.

**Entertainment**

You can order, pick and reserve your seats at the movie theater online, so it's pointless to show up to the theater earlier than the starting time. In the US, most theaters have first-come first-serve seating, so for popular movies people will typically show up hour(s) early to wait in line to get a good seat.

**New** Something I find hilarious is [Tanzverbot](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanzverbot#Stille_Tage). There are some days in Germany where dancing is actually forbidden (actually what they mean is that clubs can not be open for dancing). On Good Friday in every state dancing is expressly forbidden. I guess you should instead go to church or something.

**Cultural**

One thing I find strange is that at a job, when *you're* leaving (on good terms), *you* bring a cake to work and share with everybody. When I left my internship back in the US, my coworkers brought *me* a cake to work.

**Other**

What Americans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Germans know of as the ""ground floor."" What Germans know of as the ""first floor,"" the Americans know of as the ""second floor."" I am never going to *not* instinctively press 1 whenever I get in an elevator to go down :(.

I recently came back from a trip to Berlin and it was wonderful. I previously had a strong affection for Germany but I had never been there. On a whim I decided I'd make use of my time off and I booked a ticket to Berlin. Well, let me say it was the best decision of my life. The people were great, I felt safe (I traveled alone for the first time), the food and beer was great, the sites to see, I really soaked up the atmosphere. I am determined to learn the language to a fluent degree now, I spoke very little German there, I said what I could and even that made me feel great. In short, I just wanted to let off steam about how great my vacation was and it sucks to be home (Ireland) and back to reality. I thought about the possibility of moving to Germany one day but now I know I must. I will get my degree in Software Development and I'll continue to learn the language over the next few years.

The time has come for the restructuring of the organisation, ESPECIALLY its involvement online.

So I propose that the german hive of reddit allies to do something about it.

My idea is a website where we demand the restructuring the GEMA and its power. There also should be a petition where users could sign to show their support and after a while we will pass these results to the responsible politician(s).

Please understand that I am by far no expert on copyright law but I want to initiate something to change the current situation.

IMO the GEMA is seriously hindering the digital progress in Germany and the concept itself is just outdated.


What do you think?

**Edit:**

Wow, I really love your support! I knew that almost everybody hates GEMA but this thread shows (hopefully) that there are loads of people who would actually contribute to fighting this ridiculous organization.

Where do we go from here?

IMO the best approach would be to create a website (e.g.         www.wehategema.de) which should include the follwoing topics:

* FAQ about GEMA and why it is so bad

* News about the ridiculous actions by GEMA

* A petition where users could sign in order to show their support for restructuring of the organozation 

This will be helpful for two reasons:

1. The education of people why GEMA sucks

2. Establishing support

If there are enough people who sign up it eventually will catch the eye of politicians which is the first to bring them down. These supporters are very likely to voters which matters in politics. 

Maybe we (eventually) could even get support by corporations or artists?


psYberspRe4Dd already created [/r/GEMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/GEMA), so please join if you are willing to help

How can we do this?


Answer: Division of labour!

Everybody can contribute!

Tasks:

* Website (do you know how to make a proper website?)

* Information gathering (FAQs about GEMA, news etc.)

in the past few months there has been an increase of requests to help people with their German homework. While we are happy to see that learning German is in high demand and while there are always some users happy to help out, there have been quite a few submissions that just seem too much - requests to translate whole pages, google translate massacres and the like. Most of the time these submissions are pretty controversial among the community, getting both upvotes and downvotes (but usually more downvotes). 

Since it often takes a considerable amount of time and effort to help you, we've come up with some fun rules, in effect immediately:

* **Please do as much of your assignment as you can**, we can correct your mistakes, but we shouldn't have to your homework! (thanks eurostud!)

* **If you just use google translate** and then expect the community to fix that mess, your submission will be removed. 

* **You will have to offer something in return:** It doesn't really matter what it is, you could sing for us, draw us something, do our taxes or tell us a joke - just be creative! That way, helping out is more rewarding and good times will be had by all.

Also, please be aware of the existence of

""Should I move to Germany?""
""What do I need to do to move to Germany?""

over and over again. So much so, that I contemplate unsubscribing. 

A FAQ could offer general advice and there could also be a section where top ""advice"" posts could be added so that users wouldnt need to do the searching, the information would be right there in front of them. 

If not a FAQ, it could b ea thread we start, and when a good amount of information is added, it could be added to the sidebar so people with questions could go there. 


Does anyone else think this is a good idea? Thoughts?

**EDIT:** Anyone interested in helping me put together a FAQ thread we can refer users to? We can get look through the questions which have been most commonly asked and start from there. This would require facts with supporting sources. Personal experiences would be added to the Thread in link-form (referring people to previous threads with opinions and experiences).

But sometimes there are things that bother me. 

For me it's the fact that a lot of people (not everyone but a lot) think normal Milk (as opposed to ~~skimmed milk~~ low fat) is bad for you and would make you fat. My German roommate that eats a bag of chips every night is disgusted by the fact I even buy the 3,8% fat milk. Even lots of German cafes prepare their cappuccinos and lattes with ~~skimmed milk~~ low fat which truly blows my mind.

Which brings me to another thing. Germans always informing me about how ""weird"" my food is. It's not that they have an opinion, that's OK; it's that EVERYONE ALWAYS says what they think. Eating raw mince on bread with onions in the morning is ""voll geil"" but me eating fries parallel to rice gets everyone to make that face as if I'm eating a bag of elephant shit.

Es will besser werden, ich verspreche! :)

I work for a major German company in Denmark, where I now have a 4 year contract to work in Germany. I will be located in the Stuttgart/Karlsruhe area, where we have gotten an apartment.
Me, wife and two children will move in the middle of july, and are looking forward to it. I have always liked German people and culture a lot, so it will be an exciting time for us. Bier und bratwurst gefällt uns gut! ;)

My company helps us with the mandatory paper work, but I think there is still many details that are foreign to us. I should get used to a little more politeness and using peoples last name in my working place, which is different from Danish culture. Also, I hope that we will not feel isolated, since we know no people in advance.
If anyone from Germany, or even the relevant area, would like to be in contact with us, it would be appreciated. I am sure many stupid questions about living in Germany will arise, and it would be nice to have someone I could write or talk to from time to time..

So who ever you are, feel free to contact me if you have time and resources in spare for a newcomer.

A little about us: Approx. 30 years old, M.Sc. in Economy and leadership. Very interested in foreign cultures and beautiful city/nature. Our children are 1½ year and 3 months old. I have been musically active (guitar, bass) in Denmark, and also have interest in cars and IT. I recently got a motorcycle driving license, which I hope to use in the beautiful Baden-Wuerttemberg.

Hope to hear from some one.

I recently had the opportunity to spend two weeks traveling around Germany with my brother and sacrificing sleep to see as much as I could.  It was a fantastic time and I couldn't have asked for a better way to spend my vacation.

We managed to see a lot in two weeks: [Dresden](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872323762/), [Berlin](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872317596/), [Potsdam](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872313728/), [Hamburg](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872305706/), Bremen, [Frankfurt](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872294632/), [Cologne](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872277974/), [Augsburg](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8872263954/).  But there was so much that we missed due to time constraints. (Also getting lost more than once.)  

Travel and lodging was a much simpler matter than in the US.  Having a six day Deutsche Bahn rail pass made travel an uncomplicated matter.  We never had to worry about buying tickets or train times (except perhaps reservations for long journeys).  Hostels made lodging a non-issue. We could book a day in advance and that gave us maximum flexibility in our schedule with a minimum of cost.  Hostels also gave us an introduction to some interesting and fun people.

Some of the interesting highlights were:

* A particularly ‘interesting’ hostel that was located on a [houseboat](http://www.flickr.com/photos/96669799@N08/8871701421/)
* An American themed ‘[Red Cup](http://www.redcupparty.de)’ party at a club in Cologne
* Visiting some of my brother’s exchange partners/friends (local contacts are invaluable!)
* Augsburg (A surprisingly fun/beautiful city)

I had so much fun exploring Germany and I can’t wait to go back someday.  If I spoke better German I would seriously consider getting a job there (IT is in demand everywhere, right?)

The German people were awesome and helpful (if a bit reserved). While it was certainly harder to meet people in a more than ask for directions sort of way, the local friends that we already knew made a good trip into a fantastic one.

Also this subreddit (along with others such as /r/travel) was a fantastic resource for that extra bit of knowledge to make my trip go smoothly.

TLDR: Germany is awesome!

Here are my opinions on the matter",wobinidan,85,13,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/18o8bh/i_just_watched_the_documentary_about_workers_at/,"Firstly, I am working at a costume warehouse, who needed somewhere in the region of 150-200 extra workers for very short term work for the carnival season.  They offered (and paid) us 8 euros per hour, which in Berlin is a resaonable sum for the kind of work that almost anyone can do.   The workers at Amazon received 8.52 per hour, which is certainly a decent amount of money for the simplest of work that basically anyone can do, especially for those from foreign countries who would normally earn much less.

The first mistake was in lying about the wage.  If the workers were promised 9.50 per hour, that is the first lie, and every worker should be given the money they were promised.

As for the complaints about having to walk 18 kilometres per day, that is just part of the job.   Your job is to walk up and down for 8 hours, so get over it.    It's boring work, no doubt about it, but that's why you're getting paid.  So I don't have any sympathy there. 

The big difference I notice is that the Amazon warehouses are in the middle of fucking nowhere, thus requiring thousands of people to temporarily stay in shitty towns that don't have much of a labour pool to draw from.   Berlin has thousands of unemployed, desperate people to call upon, and it was very enlightening to meet many of the 'unwilling to work' Hartz IV people who were hoping to break out of the cycle of unemployment and actually make enough money to live on.

On the whole, I was very happy with my employers for this season, and would happily work for them again.  It wasn't perfect, but they didn't treat us like shit, and at the end of a stressful night shift, they would break out a couple of crates of beer, instead of sending a neo-nazi gang to intimidate us.

I don't feel any less exploited than the workers in this documentary, and they in fact earned more than me.  But they never treated me less than equal to them, and that is a sign that good companies do exist in Germany, even if they only need you for a month or so,",,False,,t5_2qi4z,False,,,True,t3_18o8bh,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/18o8bh/i_just_watched_the_documentary_about_workers_at/,

My name is Ariel, I'm from Alaska but currently travelling around Europe. I travel with a plush green monkey named Miles the Monkey, who I take pictures of all over the world.

Example: http://imgur.com/GYCGFeH

Several days ago I hitchhiked into Germany and left Miles in a car. I'm devastated and mounting a rescue operation.

Here's what I know.

Location: https://maps.google.com/maps?q=Boen,+Germany&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=53.086576,7.241535&amp;spn=0.017063,0.045447&amp;sll=53.145329,7.324791&amp;sspn=0.136319,0.363579&amp;oq=boen&amp;hnear=Boen,+Germany&amp;t=h&amp;z=15
(rest area along route 31, roughly 30 km north of Lathen)

Driver: Henrik (not sure the exact spelling): red car, about 60 years old, lives in Germany (somewhere close to the place he dropped me off) but works in the Netherlands and all over Europe (see below)

HERE'S HOW YOU CAN HELP!

Henrik told me he works for something called the  European Employment Service Agency (not sure of the exact name but something along those lines). He helps Germans get work in other countries and be able to legally do so. If this description is something you recognize, please help me find the exact name of this organization so I can contact them! I think that is the best chance I have of finding Henrik and hence Miles the Monkey.

Help me find my traveling buddy!

1362849035.0,67,self.germany,19z6o4,A friend wrote a guide: Renting Apartments,DHGG86,81,14,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/19z6o4/a_friend_wrote_a_guide_renting_apartments/,"* EUR quantities are examples. 

**Kaltmiete** EUR 240
This is just you pure rent (without the inclusion of any additional bills, e.g. water, gas for heating, electricity and other costs you have to pay like trash and maintenance fees).

**Nebenkosten** EUR 72,10
These costs are for general additional costs like the fees for your maintenance and trash. A lot of times this will also include the cost of water (but you will have to double check on that - do NOT just assume it's automatically in there). Sometimes it may also include the cost of gas - but VERY unlikely! In most inserts you will see the cost of gas listed separately. In VERY rare cases it also includes the cost of electricity. However, generally speaking, the cost of electricity will be paid by yourself and will NOT be included in the Nebenkosten. 

As we had discussed, the Nebenkosten is one VERY important item to follow up on with the landlord regarding what is included in your Nebenkosten and what is not. At the end of every year (which may NOT be the end of a calendar year), you will receive a listing of the ACTUAL Nebenkosten (e.g. how much water you actually used vs the amount they set as a general fee). Depending on how much you have paid in, you may have to pay some additional Nebenkosten (it should generally NOT be a lot). As an example, I ended up having to pay an additional EUR 10 at the end of the year, because the trash fees went up. But that was EUR 10 for the ENTIRE year. Do NOT just accept the landlord telling you that you need to pay more. Mine automatically provided me with the letter from the city of Frankfurt claiming that fees had been raised and a full breakdown of all of the fees that were included in the Nebenkosten (like a bill). That is how it should be! Also, the determination of Nebenkosten, the billing and handling of it, needs to be part of your contract.

**Heizkosten** EUR 30
According to this insert, it seems that this is what you will pay to THEM for heating costs (e.g. gas) - but it could also be that this will be paid to a heating company directly by you (ask!). Heating with gas is pretty standard in Germany, however, there are other mechanisms.

I myself do not pay heating costs to my landlord, but have my own account with my heating company. If you are paying it to the landlord, you need to ask, whether he will charge you more, should you use more, and ALSO, if he will refund you if you used less. If he says, this is a flat rate, then he should not charge you more or refund you. Make sure that you are clear on this point. In cold winters (like this past one), you will be heating a lot (basically straight through Sept - Mar, AT LEAST).

**Gesamtmiete** EUR 342,20
According to this insert this is your ""warm rent"" (total rent). Again, pay attention to what is included in your warm rent as outlined above. As apartments show costs differently (some include water in the Nebenkosten, others don't), you need to find a basis to compare them. 

**Stromverbrauch**
This is the cost of electricity. As this insert lists what they THINK you will use, it means that your electricity bill will run on top of your rent and over your own name (not the landlord). That is pretty standard practice. 

I pay about EUR 40-50 a month for electricity (that is a LOT for my small apartment, but I also use a lot). However, even if you do pay attention to using little, do not expect for this to be lower than EUR 30 per month. At the end of the year, they will send you a bill showing what you have used, versus what expected monthly fee of your usage they charged you and you will either get a refund or have to pay on top.

**Kaution oder Genossenschaftsanteile - 3 Monatsgrundmieten**
Kaution is your deposit (do NOT confuse this with ""Provision""). This apartment says your deposit is 3 monthly cold rents (so, EUR 240 x 3). That is pretty standard and it is also the maximum they are legally allowed to charge you, unless you agree otherwise. Legally you have 3 months to pay your Kaution (meaning, you pay for 3 months double rent - once regular rent for the month and once Kaution). However, a lot of landlords want to have it up front. Be aware of that! You have the law on your side, but if you agree in a contract that you will pay it upon moving in, then you have to cough up 4 months rent right at the beginning (3 months Kaution and one month rent for the first month). 

It is standard practice that this will be deposited into a SEPARATE bank account (banks have SPECIAL accounts just for that - called Mietkautionskonto) and you should be made aware of the bank's name AND account number for this account (also, the account should run ONLY under the name of the landlord ... not the name of his wife, or buddy or priest). Some landlords want you to arrange the Mietkautionskonto yourself, deposit the funds and grant them power to access the account if necessary (and then just send them the receipt). This needs to be part of the contract!!! Do NOT just agree to give him the money in hand. 

This is a DEPOSIT. If you trash the place, you won't be refunded anything. However, if the place is just fine, then he will refund the money to you (the definition of the term ""just fine"", I mean with that, the condition the apartment was taken in and should also be given back, should also be part of your contract). Also, be aware, you are NOT entitled to receive the deposit back right when you move out. The landlord has the right to keep the money until the ""Nebenkostenabrechnung"" for the year is through, to see if you would have had to theoretically pay anything back to the landlord. However, most landlords just give it back to you upon moving out (or a part of it, if there need to be repairs).

As you may have noticed, the title above also includes the term ""Genossenschaftsanteile"" - this is a total other animal within itself. I do not think you will come across this for your purposes. If you do, lets have a further discussion about this. In short, instead of paying a Kaution, you purchase shares of the company holding the building, putting you more into the position of being a renter with ""owner aspects"". It has many potential advantages, especially if you choose this place for a longer period of time. MAJOR downside - if they make major repairs on the building and the fees that have been collected so far are not sufficient to cover the construction costs, you may be on the hook to pay the difference. Again, you will likely not see this.

**Provision fuer Mieter - 2.38 Monatsgrundmieten**
This is what we talked about with the finders fee that you would have to pay for this apartment (2.38 cold rents so 2.38 x EUR 240). I refused to pay that and did not look for apartments with that cost. If you agree to it, that cost will have to be paid upon signing the contract and/ or moving in. Just FYI - that means, you are paying upon moving in the first month's rent (incl. Nebenkosten), possibly the whole deposit (so 3 month's cold rent) AND 2.38 x cold rent for the Provision. That is more than 6 months rent in the first month - be aware of that!!!

**SCHUFA Auskunft**
This is the German equivalent of a credit report. It works a little different than in the US. However, the principal is the same - it shows whether you are trustworthy out of a financial perspective. Since you never had a credit card or long term credit in Germany, I highly doubt that you will even have a SCHUFA report. 

Cities and landlords are different when it comes to SCHUFA. In Braunschweig, it is generally not requested as there are plenty of appartments. In Frankfurt it is pretty much always requested by the landlord (as there are SO many people looking for decent places, the landlords use this to weed out the good ones). 

Regardless of the SCHUFA, something that is fairly standard practice is that you have to show your last 3 months' paychecks. I know you do not have that. So, just tell them that and then talk about any other securities you may be able to provide (e.g. suggest you will pay the 3 month deposit right up front). A lot of times college students would be required to have their parents sign with them (not always though). Regardless, you do not have the option for your parents to sign with you. I am thinking, offering the full Kaution upfront is reasonable enough. Do not let him back you into a corner. There are other places!

**OTHER NOTES**

This apartment includes a kitchen. That is NOT standard in Germany. Generally the kitchen (room) should have all the plugs (e.g. water, electricity, etc.), but the actual kitchen with a stove and fridge are NOT automatically in there. If an appartment does have a kitchen, it will for SURE be included in the listing (it's a MAJOR plus and attraction for people). However, BE AWARE (!!!), some people want you to BUY the kitchen (meaning, you rent the apartment, but purchase the kitchen). REALLY pay attention to that (they usually list this in the written description on the bottom of the page, not at the very top). The reason why I wrote so many words in capital letters, is from what I have seen, people requested outrageous prices for their kitchens (I mean, like EUR 2-4K) ... ridiculous!

This apartment is also fully furnished - again, not standard. But we talked about that. 

In general, while writing this out and thinking about this a little more ... and this is just my opinion ... you may want to consider just moving into a WG temporarily. It is first of all cheaper (especially right at the beginning) and second, it allows you to not deal with a lot of this hassle. I know it is not what you wanted. But just think of this as a temporary for a few months. Once you have really started working, you will have paychecks to proof security, your German will be better and you will not just pick the first crappy appartment/ landlord that will have you bc you are under time pressure. Just give it a thought! :)",,False,,t5_2qi4z,False,,,True,t3_19z6o4,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/19z6o4/a_friend_wrote_a_guide_renting_apartments/,

Recently I bumped into a long series of images of WWII German soldiers off and around the battlefield. It had a very humanizing effect. I'm not trying to link WWII German Veterans with the holocaust, I'm just curious the stories your grandparents/elders have or the general opinion/consensus on your WWII veterans.

In America they're becoming more and more rare to come by, they're usually treated with high respect/honored. It's not always this way as I'm sure you've heard of Vietnam war veterans being spit on. Anyway, I'd like to see your perspective

Tcheus!

EDIT: Thank you so much for all of your replies! It's been a really wonderful journey getting a fresh perspective on the war and hearing all of the stories from your studies and families. I'm starting to think Germany may perhaps be one of the most thoughtful countries on the planet. I understand asking a question like this may be a social faux pas I'm sorry if I caused any offense.

All those headlines that (before it had been launched) people were going to be burglarised as a result of the extra information being put on the web against their will, or the 21st century American Stasi are coming to town cooked up a frenzy in Germany to the point where there were so many censor/address pixelation requests that Google had to hire extra temporary staff to process them all.

Of course after it was launched there was (as expected) no major stories run, the sky wasn't falling and Google got pissed off enough that it said [it will not be doing any further updates to Germany](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2383363,00.asp) as a result.

I know that Germany has a shaky history with regards to fear of being spied on and are generally seen as late-adopters to new concepts but I can't help but think they've shot themselves in the foot here, [just look at the current coverage, with this pretty sizeable hole in the middle of Europe](http://www.abload.de/img/streetvieweuropea3k1r.png).

If there hadn't have been this huge outcry from the public I'm sure Germany would have enjoyed by now full streetview coverage.

1316360028.0,53,self.germany,kjk2f,Update after my trip to Osnabrück,,62,9,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/kjk2f/update_after_my_trip_to_osnabrück/,"I just returned to the United States from my trip to Osnabrück and wanted to take a second to say that GERMANY IS AMAZING. I loved the suggestions I received on here, and in the little free time I had, I managed to get a good look around the Altstadt and ate some delicious food and drank some delicious beer. One bar I went to had a 2-for-1 special AND gave out free bottles of Schnapps! 4 Euros for two large beers and a bottle of Schnapps? Um, yes, please. Or rather, ""Ples, yease,"" because I'm hammered at that point.

But what I really want to acknowledge is my story on my very last morning of my trip. I took the bus from an Osnabrück bus station to the airport for a relatively early flight connecting in Frankfurt. After getting on the bus, I quickly realized I had left my backpack at the bus stop! In it were my passport, my computer, my iPad, my digital camera (with pictures from the trip!), my jewelry (yeah, I'm a girl, it turns out, so this was a big deal), and all of my notes from the business element of my trip.

The bus driver turned around immediately, and NO ONE on the bus seemed at all bothered that the stupid American girl was going to make people later for the airport. We got there quickly, but the bag was gone. The bus driver asked people waiting for buses and other drivers if the bag had been seen, and no one had seen anything happen. The bus driver and I agreed: it was gone.

I got back on the bus, to a round of gasps and ""Schade""s. People were clearly sad for me. I got to the airport and the woman at the ticket counter offered the most sincere apology for my lack of passport, and told me to see the airport police to discuss possible courses of action, adding that she hoped she'd see me again for printing my boarding passes.

The police offered to get me out of Germany and into the States with no passport! ""Yeah, here in Germany we know mistakes happen, and if someone loses a passport we let them in no problem. So of course we let you out no problem as well."" It only came with the risk of getting to San Francisco only to be denied entry BY the United States. Since it was the return portion of a round-trip booked at the same time, and my trip TO Germany took place with a valid passport, and since I had a US-issued ID (my driver's license), and since I'd checked in online the night before and input my passport info, I thought I had decent odds of being allowed entry after serious questioning and decided to take their offer of exporting me.

Then, an hour before my flight was scheduled to leave, I got a call from the organizer of the event I was at in Osnabrück. I had called him on the bus to ask what he suggested I do, in terms of filing a police report and such. He said he had my backpack!

This is when I decided I was IN LOVE WITH GERMANY. He went into the city at 8am on Saturday morning, without my asking since I was sure it was gone forever, determined to find my bag. Apparently, pedestrians had seen an abandoned backpack, didn't want it to get stolen, and had found the nearest open business--a bakery--and gave it to an employee. We told the airport workers, who were all happy for me, and they assured me that I would not miss my flight, and that they would hold it until I had my passport, printed my boarding passes, got through security, and made it onto the plane. When I got on the plane, several people from the bus noticed my backpack and expressed the most genuine happiness that I had made it. When I got to Frankfurt, it was also clear that they were expecting to have to work with me to get me to San Francisco without a passport. When they saw me with a boarding pass and passport and no problems, they seemed confused; I guess Osnabrück never called to let them know all was fine.

What the hell, Germany!? How are people so nice? In the States, they don't hold planes for people who lost their shit on the way to the airport. MAYBE for people with late connections, MAYBE if the passport was stolen forcefully, but not people who lose their backpacks.

When I arrived in Germany in 2001, with no knowledge of German, I met an old man in the neighborhood. He took me in like his grandson and taught me German everyday. He was the kindest man I've known my life. He loved children and photography. Before I left Germany 3 years later, he offered to support me through school and University. In the end, I left with my parents. A couple years later, in 2006, he died from liver complications. I've phoned him a couple times when he was dying in the hospital but at the time I couldn't do it.

I love Germany, absolutely love it. Except for one thing.

How to put this delicately....

**Why do your bathrooms suck so hard?** 

Seriously. 

Maybe it's culture shock but I expect toilets to annihilate my poop and teleport away my pee and I expect them to be hands-free so I don't get someone else's pee residue on me. But German toilets just kind of slosh things around. How are dogs supposed to drink out of toilets here?

Bathrooms in commercial settings in the US used pressurized water that could flush a small dog, and I have the toilet at home that can flush a bucket full of golf balls (seriously, it will).

You have to push that stupid button on the wall above a German urinals for like, 50 seconds to get it to flush all the way, and the huge rectangular button on the wall, what are you supposed to do, push that with the back of your head? I want my poop to be gone before I get done standing up, in germany I have to hold that button down for like 20 seconds to and watch, and watch, and watch.

And those looping cloth towel dispenser thingys? What is this, the 1950s? I need an Airblade or Xcellerator.

Every time I fly in to Frankfurt and see the efficiency of their airport, drive on the autobahn, walk around the streets of German cities and see all of the windmills and solar panels, I feel like the US is a backwards third world nation.

Every time I see how stylish people on the streets are dressed I feel like a slob. I actually buy new clothes just to not look like an American every time I travel here.

Every time I use the bathroom I leave it and throw my fists into the air and shout ""USA USA USA"".

I've only used the restroom in hotels, restaurants, and businesses. Do you guys have to put up with horrible bathrooms in your houses too?

**EDIT: for everyone saying it's about water efficiency, the US and EU have the same standard: 6 liters per flush. And you can get dual-flush toilets in the US, they're just not very common.**",,False,,t5_2qi4z,1361667799.0,,,True,t3_193qwu,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/193qwu/germanys_dark_troubling_problem/,

Erlaubnis zur Ausübung einer Beschäftigung

Sehr geehrter Herr (My Name),

Sie haben am 24.01.2013 die Erlaubnis zur Ausübung einer Beschäftigung als (JOB) bei der Firma (Company), beantragt.


Die Agentur fuer Arbeit hat dieser Beschäftigung mit Schreiben vom 25.01.2013 nicht zugestimmt, da der angegebene Bruttolohn nicht der ortsüblichen Entlohnung von 2.000, - bis 2.500,- Euro entspricht. Ihr Antrag ist daher nicht genehmigungsfähig und abzulehnen. 

Sie erhalten hiervon Kenntnis und Gelegenheit, sich innerhalb von einer Woche nach Erhalt dieses Schreibens zu äußern.

When I put this into the translator, it said I have permission to work for the company, yet since I am not making 2000 Euro a month I am rejected? Is this a requirement for me to live here? I am going to go to the Rathaus tomorrow and see but I am just kind of freaking out because I have been here for 4 months and it has taken them this long to process everything and only now they are telling me this. I should be making that much within a few months but my employment contract is less than that for the time being. Perhaps I filled out a different form saying I would be making that much and I just need to fill out a new one? My German sucks so any help would be greatly appreciated.

edit: UPDATE! I just talked to my employer and they are going to modify the contract :) Thanks for your help everyone I really appreciate it!",,False,,t5_2qi4z,1359550290.0,,,True,t3_17jzuq,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/17jzuq/am_i_going_to_have_to_go_home/,

He was last seen in Bonn around noon on Monday and has not returned home since. This has never happened before which is why we are all quite worried.

If you happened to see him over the past few days, please let me know as soon as possible! 
Otherwise, if you are in either Cologne or Bonn please keep an eye out for him and tell him to come home if you see him. Don't worry he is not dangerous!!!

**Details**:

*Height: 170cm

Being a fool that I am - i absolutely forgot that ive had a periodical driver's license issued 10 years ago - for the period of......wait for it.... 10 years! 

Sad part is that i was painflully reminded about that fact by a German Police Officer during a routine check in Dusseldorf :( 

I was fined 300 Euro for that fact (which is pretty huge sum for me), paid it on the spot, apologiezed and got back into the car as a passanger. 

Now few weeks after this situation i got the following in the mailbox:

Can dear redditors from germany help me out and tell me what is that and what should i do with it? From the google translator i understood that this is some kind of report statement for the Police - but im not sure wether im being sued for something here, or is it just a routine questionary etc. 

I heard you guys have pretty high class jails over there, but i dont want to go to jail :(((

**edit:** Thank for all the help guys - I have sent messages to few different lawyers regarding the situation, an d i hope i can come out of it without too much damage. Im pretty scared with it being a crime not an offence, but mostly im damn terrified that my home budget can take very serious hit.

It's the every-day life of Germans that we would like to experience without having to live there for many months (I know this might be difficult as Germany is an icon of the first world).

Our trip will be from Frankfurt south-east towards Munich. Then through the Czech Rep. and to Poland (seeing family). Then again into Germany up to Berlin and Westward towards the Netherlands. Most of our trip will be in Germany, however.

Any suggestions are appreciated. 

EDIT: I just discovered what is called the 'German Wine Road', which takes you through wine country. Sounds promising. Any suggestions on this?

EDIT2: Visiting in Mid September to Early October. Will be in Munich for Oktoberfest.

1327526777.0,37,self.germany,owla6,A little humor piece I wrote to present to a German Class tomorrow in Germany--Written from an American perspective,Vanilla62,55,18,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/owla6/a_little_humor_piece_i_wrote_to_present_to_a/,"As an American in Germany you are going to experience the phenomenon of “culture shock” at some level or another. Here, I’ve gathered a list of some of the major differences that will stare any newly arrived tourist from the States right in the face. Additionally, I’ve tried to include some of the smaller nuances that take more time, and in some cases many years, to recognize.

Let’s start with some big ones:

Germans come across as overly serious and strict. But that’s old news.
You better get out of the way on the Autobahn, otherwise you’ll probably get rear-ended—we aren’t used to the no speed limit thing.
Germans can’t stand loud kids or kids in general.
In a formal setting you better stick to the plan and do so without delay—otherwise, you might have some red-faced businessmen/women or teachers staring you down.
Germans are initially fairly reserved when it comes to meeting a stranger.
You’re also going to experience the awkward moment when a friend introduces you to his or her close friends. The newly introduced female will approach you for a hug and kiss both of your cheeks. Woah.
Smoking is almost still socially acceptable over here. Don’t be surprised if you find yourself standing in circle of smokers or in smokey room. 
Don’t jaywalk. You’ll likely get a hefty fine—or worse, a mother waiting with her children on the other side yelling some gibberish your way.
If you spend an evening out on the town, it’ll quickly dawn on you that German night life is rather different. The drinking age: 16 to drink beer, 18 to drink liquor—but, they’re pretty liberal; don’t be surprised to see some 15 year olds drinking vodka on the street. Oh yeah, you can legally drink as much as you please in public. You can even drink alcohol in a moving vehicle as long as you are a back seat passenger. 

If you’re invited over to someone’s apartment you’ll certainly notice differences.
The doors. You aren’t going to find any doorknobs. 
Inside, make sure to take off your shoes. That’s a must here.
You may notice—well, you will if you’re spending the night in a traditional German home—that the beds are quite different. Forget about finding a king-size bed, you’ll most likely find yourself in a twin about a foot off the floor. 
The German toilet. While most toilets in Germany have a superb flushing function, you’ll notice that many are equipped with what I like to call the “observation deck.” I don’t want to explain the details, but you’ll notice that when you use the toilet, whatever you put in there will not be submerged in water pre-flush. Rather, it will be exposed to fill the room with your aroma. 

In Germany, Sunday is taken seriously as the day of rest. You better have stocked up on food—and I don’t mean frozen meals—otherwise you’re going to have a hard time finding anything to eat. Almost all commercial stores are locked up. But with any luck, you might find a hidden bakery open early in the morning. However, that’s not common. If you’re American, you’ll be used to finding a fast food joint on every street or highway exit. You won’t here. So, plan accordingly.

If you’re going to talk sports, make sure you make the clear distinction between “American football” and football, i.e. soccer, or if you’re linguistically advanced, Fußball. Back home in the States you might be comfortable taking a jab at a friend’s favorite team. But tread carefully in Germany. If you go too far here, you might be sitting on your return flight with a broken nose. And, don’t even dare bother with baseball. They won’t get it. 

Do you want to see a wide-eyed German? Try leaving the typical American 20% tip on your bill. Your waitress might just kiss you. 
Germans are also very direct. They criticize very openly, so try not to be insulted too quickly. 
The American baseball cap is frowned upon—this is a huge issue for me. 
Wait for the “Guten Appetit” signal at the beginning of meals to start eating. 
When you’re having a round of drinks, frequent cheers or “prost”-s are usual. But, make sure to look every single person in the eyes as your glasses make contact. You could get cursed for 7 years!

And lastly, contrary to common belief, Germans play lacrosse.

I studied German for about 6 years and spent a month living in Munich, so I'm not completely flying blind here, but I'd like some outside input if you have any. 

This character is an enthusiastic hoarder of big/fancy/pretentious/unusual English words, but his interest in English grammar is basically inversely proportional to his interest in vocabulary, so he speaks with a weird combination of erudition and ignorance. Imagine translating German grammar more or less literally into English. 

So, with that in mind, does anyone have any words of advice? What are some common grammatical errors that German learners of English make? What are the hallmarks of a German whose grasp on English grammar is shaky? Anything I should avoid?

Well, the title pretty much sums it up.

My only condition is (and this is why I am doing this and also don't just leave codes in here) that you are **actually going to the Cebit**.

You would be a douchebag if you would take tickets and sell or don't use them.

Just leave a nice comment and I will see what I can do.

Hello!

I need to find Heinz.

**The story:** My friend did NOT have an awesome childhood (Won't go into detail for the sake of his privacy) yet despite it, he is one of the most hardworking, gentle, kind, *good* people I know. He avoided his home as much as possible by going to an after school youth place, and he credits one of the staff as the only positive male role model of his not awesome childhood. I would like to give my friend the opportunity to get in contact with his role model... either to catch up, or to thank him for his help, or whatever he wants.

**The situation:** My friend moved away before he was a teenager, and obviously did not think to get contact info to stay in touch. All the details I have to run with are:

* a worker at an after school youth place
* named Heinz
* this youth place is most likely in Buchholz outside Hamburg.   
Very small possibility this detail may be incorrect.
* this would have probably been around the years 1992-1998.  
Very small possibility it was before.

**TL;DR If you are (or know) Heinz who worked in a youth centre in maybe Buchholz at some point during 1992-1998 PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE have him PM me or reply in here. I would love to do this for my friend for Christmas, I think it would mean a lot to him!**

--------------------------------------------

Hallo,

ich bin auf der Suche nach Heinz.

**Die Hintergrundgeschichte:** Ein guter Freund von mir hatte leider keine sehr schöne Kindheit. (Ich werde nicht ins Detail gehen um seine Privatsphäre zu schützen) Er ist einer der fleißigsten, sanftesten, freundlichsten und einfach guten Menschen. Er vermied es damals so oft wie möglich nach Hause zu gehen und hat stattdessen seine Freizeit nach Schulschluss in einem Jugendtreff verbracht. Dort lernte er das erste und einzige männliche Vorbild seiner ansonsten traurigen Kindheit kennen.

Nun würde ich meinem Freund gerne die Möglichkeit geben wieder Kontakt zu seinem Kindheits-Vorbild herzustellen. Entweder um wieder Kontakt aufzunehmen oder auch um einfach nur Danke zu sagen. Was auch immer für beide okay ist.

**Die aktuelle Situation:** Mein Freund zog noch als Kind weg und hat seitdem jeglichen Kontakt verloren. Leider hat er sich seit damals auch nur wenige Informationen merken können.

Alle Details die ich habe sind:

- sein Name ist Heinz

- er arbeitete in einem Jugendtreff

- der Jugendtreff war sehr wahrscheinlich in Buchholz nahe Hamburg. Obwohl eine kleine Chance besteht, dass diese Information falsch sein könnte

- Dies alles hat sich ca. zwischen 1992-1998 abgespielt. Möglicherweise auch etwas früher

Wenn sie also möglicherweise Heinz sind, oder Heinz kennen, oder einfach nur irgendwelche Tipps haben die mir auf meiner Suche weiterhelfen könnten, melden sie sich bitte.

Ich würde dies unglaublich gerne für meinen Freund zu Weihnachten möglich machen. Ich bin mir sicher, dass es ihm viel bedeutet.",,False,,t5_2qi4z,1355082219.0,,,True,t3_14fkbp,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/14fkbp/a_christmas_miracle_help_me_find_heinz_ein/,

So, two days ago I posted here asking what I might do since I'm here by myself in Munich for my 25th birthday (Saturday). A lot of you responded with some helpful suggestions: Visit Killians Irish bar, this place, that place etc... NOO I decided I was just going to go to the first few bars I saw and get plastered. Then, while walking through the town center I hear a enormous party happening and I decided to go in. At the door, they refused to let me in without a ticket, and advised me that ""it really wasn't my scene."" The sensible thing would have been to listen to them, the thing I actually did was bribe him to let me in without a ticket. So 30 Euros later, I triumphantly walk into... the biggest gay, lesbian, transgender party in Munich. But, since I had already dropped 30 Euros to get me through the door, I decided I might as well stay awhile. All in all, I had a good time, considering people rarely buy ME a drink at bars. Eventually, though I did have to tell them I wasn't gay, which made the butt sex that much more awkward. (no, just kidding.) But it was slightly hard to avoid eye contact with all the friendly men in drag.

Sounds nice but there were a few problems especially non-native should be aware of because they might misunderstand.

At first, that woman could tell me how fast my Internet would be but she gave me the number of the technical support.  
She also couldn't tell me what I need that damn home box for. Technical support should be able to help me, though.  
The number of the technical support did not work so I couldn't check on that missing informations.  

But now the important bit, if you want some kind of information from them, they already count you agreeing to them sending you information as a temporary agreement to the contract which you've got to decline in 2 weeks. Otherwise, it's like you've bought it.

In the past, there were problems with the mobile carrier BASE.

I'm about to quit my job at the German branch of a Korean company. I very much dislike my boss, who is Korean, and he is the main reason why I am choosing to quit. The problem is he's proven to be vengeful with people who cross him, and had a very hard time replacing his last assistant and will not like to see me leave. 

I'd like to be very informed on what my right are before I hand him the letter, just in case he tries to keep me from leaving in any way. Here are my specific questions: 

1. Is he obligated to immediately sign my resignation letter?

2. As agreed in my employee manual, my vacation days were allotted from June 2012 to June 2013 (25 days in total). This being the 'second half' of that period, am I entitled to all remaining days? 

3. I received a Christmas bonus, is it safe to say he can't ask for that to be repaid?

Do you think the Zivildienst was a force for good in German society or a waste of money?

How do you feel about the termination of the Zivildienst?

Do you think it caused a social divide, i.e. young people from lower income backgrounds more inclined to serve in the military for a year whilst the more well off would serve for a year in the Zivildienst? 

Or, is the opposite true? Did the program serve to bring young people together through a shared experience of civilian service?

Yesterday she told me something crazy, so crazy it made me feel confused and angry and frustrated. She told me that people in Germany (especially men) can be scared to visit the UK because they are worried about being beaten up by British people (who are apparently very violent in general!?) AND this is because of THE WAR (i.e. World War Two). I absolutely didn’t believe what she was saying was true, and then she had a friend visiting from Germany and he asked whether he should ‘admit’ he is German in public in England in fear of being beaten up!?!? What. The. Fuck?!

This is absolute total complete 100% unadulterated pure BOLLOCKS!! I don’t know if this is a regional thing, or what? But apparently all Germans feel it, and also apparently English people are racist against Germans and we feel an animosity against all German people. 

I tried to understand how this started, and she says it is the media, she told me that in Germany, on TV, in the papers, and it is a generally accepted truism that this is how it is in England.

I just want to tell you that this is categorically definitely not true! It is just mental. People in the UK do not hate German people, that is just fucking crazy, I’ve never even thought that there could be a reason to. I remember being educated about the war, from my Dad and in school, and I was always taught that the reason any atrocities that occurred in the war came about because of one man and his party of ignorant, confused and brainwashed minions. 

There are so many people in the German army that either followed orders, or were killed.

The average German and the average British person is the same. 

I hope this makes sense, I’ve written it all in one go and quite quickly.

Love from an average UK citizen. X

Edit: is this a generally accepted truth in Germany? 

Edit2: This has been great, and I think there are of course some simple minded fucks everywhere, but I've never heard of 'krautbashing' that makes me sick. To be honest, there just isn't enough German people walking about to even target, and of course Germans don't stand out in the crowd, so I cannot imagine people purposely thinking of finding krauts to bash. England has some shitty areas, especially in big cities (like everywhere, I know) and I wouldn't recommend myself going there let alone someone who could be targeted for being foreign. But that is social problems evident in most places, due to boredom most probably.

I'm just glad that there is not a culture of fear about this, and that most have called bollocks on this, it is just the way she told me made me feel just awful! So this has been enlightening and relieving. Much love X

As I've understood companies like Universal or MGM seed their own torrents and check who downloads them?

 I understand that p2p can be controlled and therefore fined, but can other downloading tools like for example usenet or straight from a server be checked too? I'm looking to set up a NAS and fill it up with files, and then give my sister access through FTP. Would it be possible she gets a fine for checking movies this way? Because she is very paranoid about it now.

Thanks guys for all the input! It's great to see that this subreddit has such an active community.

Are German children all taught on how to recycle in school? If not, how do they learn?

Do businesses have mandatory trainings on recycling or following their environmentally friendly polices? 

Are there contests, events or other non-work related opportunities in businesses that are about promoting environmentally friendly behavior?

Any other information on the topic would be helpful! Thanks.

Recently my german girlfriend received a written warning ('Abmahnung') urging her to pay the rediculous sum of €800 because she allegedly downloaded a copyright protected movie by means of P2P filesharing (actually she's accused of making said movie availlable to others).

I've read the letter and although I understand most of it, my german is not good enough to fully understand the excessive legal lingo used.

I'll not go into details any further, but I'll suffice to say that my girlfriend has no clue what P2P filesharing is, let alone use it.


My questions are :


1) Should my girlfriend (re)act on this Abmahnung? If so, how?


2) Apparently the lawyer firm sending the letter has retrieved her real address through her (non-static) IP address.  Is it common practice for German ISPs to hand out such information so easily?

On a [privacy related wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_aspects_of_file_sharing) I found the following :
&gt;""In Germany court specifically considered the right to privacy and in March 2008 the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that ISPs could only give out IP address subscription information in case of a ""serious criminal investigation"". The court furthermore ruled that copyright infringement did not qualify as a serious enough offense. Subsequently, in April 2008, the Bundestag (German parliament) approved a new law requiring ISPs to divulge the identity of suspected infringers who infringe on a commercial scale.""
&gt;

On a [german filesharing related website](http://www.iggdaw.de/regeln-fur-abgemahnte) I found the following:
&gt;""Panik und Angst sind natürlich ein schlechter Ratgeber. Es ist Teil ihrer Strategie! Sie sollten erkennen: es handelt sich bei der Abmahnung um ein sehr lukratives Geschäftsmodell, dessen einziges Ziel es ist, durch den Deckmantel der Bekämpfung von Internetkriminalität, mit einfachsten Mitteln schnell und einfach Geld zu verdienen.""


Being Dutch myself I'm honestly quite blown away with how German law firms are apparently getting away with doing 'business' like this.

When I confronted him about it, he brushed it off and basically ignored me. I refused to come into work until it was settled, that was in March.

I have sent him a Mahnung, which was ignored, various e-mails and SMSes which have gone answered, but he just basically ignores me. A very friendly Redditor, who is a lawyer, offered me some advice, but it has fallen short of being useful, unfortunately.

I am leaving Germany next Saturday for the Netherlands, but I'm not giving up on this. He owes me 1600eur and I'm entitled to it, and I'm fucking getting it.

Now, I just don't know where my options are. I suppose I will get a Mahnbescheid by going through the Mahnverfahren. I really want to avoid that though, but my boss has refused to be amicable.

In the US normally I would turn to the newspapers and basically get my story out about this guy being a crook who uses interns for slave labor, refuses to pay them, and makes their lives hell. However, I don't know if that would be considered slander here. If I threaten him to go to the newspaper he might finally give in, as he's a pretty prominent name in the video game industry in Berlin and has given several speeches/keynotes at major industry events in Germany.

So, I appeal to anyone who is versed in law, a law student, or a lawyer, **PLEASE** help me. I don't have much money, but I can pay you what I can. I'm absolutely entitled to the money, have a legitimate job contract filed with the Agentur fuer Arbeit, and have proof I was never paid.

I hope this isn't breaking any of the rules but I have created an app for Android phones as a hobby and I thought some people on this forum might be interested in it. It is a completely free hobby project of mine and I would love some people to see if they can get some use out of it.

The app collects news from German (and English) news sites. You can then read the news in German (or English) and if you don't know a word you tap on it to obtain a translation. You can also read Wikipedia and Wiktionary articles on that word for more information.

I made it while living in Germany as an ex-pat and I wanted to read the news that the Germans were reading.

It uses the FreeDict dictionaries for translating, so it doesn't have the biggest database to pull from (unfortunately Google and Leo would want me to pay them to use their dictionaries) but the German/English ones are pretty good.

I hope some people use it and it helps them improve their German! Could definitely be used by Germans looking to improve their English as well:)

There are a couple of different visas you can get here in Germany:
1. Temporary Visa without a college eduction
2. Temporary Visa with a college education
3. Permanent Visa

All three should allow Kindergeld.  However, the government agency mis read the rules and decided to cancel the kindergeld.  

I had two options either lawyer up and go fighting or simply apply for the permanent visa and short circuit their argument.  After reading the requirements for the permanent visa I did not think I met all requirements, namely paid 5 years into Rentenversicherung (however, they just want proof that you have paid into Social security somewhere at least 5 years, which I could prove).

Also, assume for all of this that needing to be able to speak/read/write German is not a barrier for me. 

My boyfriend is from Germany and we been dating about a year and a half. I studied in Germany for five months and he is currently studying here in the US. He will head back in January, and then I want to start making some serious considerations about our future. He still has a couple more semesters at his uni left and will probably begin his masters immediately after, so, if we stay together, I would need to be the one moving to Germany. This is something I am willing to do, but I know it's easier said than done.

I am trying to grasp the likelihood that I would find some way to (legally) stay in Germany longer than the 90-day tourist visa. I want us to be able to try living together for a few months like a normal couple, something we've never really been able to do. I have a bachelor's degree in a political science-related field and am currently working as a project manager for a healthcare IT company (so although it is a tech field the work is more managerial in nature). I anticipate having sufficient savings by next summer to at least stay in Germany through the 90-day period, but I want the security of knowing that if things are going well and it all feels right, I won't have to pack up at the end of this period and be (temporarily) barred from seeing him again. 

I've read enough here to know that it's not so simple as saying I'll go over there and find work teaching English. I guess my ace in the hole in all of this is that we could always just get married, assuming we feel that we're already heading in that direction, and solve the problem of a residency/working permit, but I'd like to not feel forced into doing that (and I know that has its own host of bureaucratic hoops to leap through). I'm also open to the idea of getting my master's in Germany, but again, I'd like to not feel forced into doing that for the sake of staying.

I have a general plan of trawling the internet, especially sites like Xing, to start to get my name out there and to see what opportunities I can find before I would actually arrive in Germany (this again being only a hypothetical prospect right now; it's not something I would act on for several more months), but it seems likely that I would have better luck when I'm actually in Germany and can interact with prospective employers directly.

I guess the crux of this exceedingly long post, now that you have some background is:

What would you suggest I look into, or what actions would you suggest I take, to better prepare myself for the prospect of trying to find gainful employment in Germany? For example, should I get CELTA certified as a safety net? Is there a demand for project management skills in Germany, or a specific way I can market those skills? (It's somewhat of a booming field here).

Does any of this seem feasible? I am trying to be grounded and thoughtful but I realize this can still come off as just another idealistic American biting off more than they can chew.

Long story short, I need some postcards from germany, and I believe you can help me.

* **What?**

My brother and I want to give to my sister each month (during one year) a box full of little typical things from a random country, and we want to join real postcards from the location. It's a part of her birthday present, and this month, **it's Germany** ! :)

We can buy little things (I live in Strasbourg), but we can't send postcards from all Germany. So I was hoping some redditors could help us by writing postcards!

* **Why?**

The truth is, she’s actually having a hard time, trying to figure out what she really wants in life. It’s her 30th birthday, and I think she's doing some kind of “thirty midlife crisis”. She's got a job (as graphic designer), a great bf of 10 years, owns a flat (she’s paying off), but she doesn’t know if it’s the life she wants to live anymore. She is dreaming of freedom, seeks change, wants to travel alone all over the world, see different things, meet amazing people and take some time to think about her life… But she doesn’t know if she is “brave” enough to do it (reason and emotion say something clearly different and she doesn’t know which one trust).

So why the postcards? I don’t know if she should follow her thoughts, and I don’t believe I have to influence her. I just want her to be happy. It’s a gift, to help her see something “different”. And I believe Redditors are the best to make something unique.

* **What can I do?**

If you’re willing to help: **Thank You!** (But if not, thank you for reading this long post, and have a good day  ;-) ).

It’ll be perfect if it’s in the original language of the country. Anything is great! She is cheerful, open-minded, value friendship and family, helpful, and have a great sense of humor. You can write funny things, silly things, words of wisdom or hope, wishes, poems, even dictionary definition or instructions manual if you want… You can also draw, add a real flower or leaf, a picture of animal, or anything that could take her on a journey… It’s entirely free, so **do what you want**!

PM me (or comment) and I’ll send you the address (it’s in France). 

Even if I’m not wealthy, I believe I can afford to reimburse you, one way or another, so if you want, I can give you something in exchange for the card+fees (Sending a card in return? Money via paypal? An awesome ultimate upvote?). I know it’s not costly (maybe 2-3$ maximum for a card+stamp?), but it's the least I can do.

And sorry for my English, I hope it wasn’t too hard to read!

I'm new here and have been using the site [wg-gesucht](http://www.wg-gesucht.de) to try and find a place. I got an email that at first seemed legit, mostly the same as the others. Then I got an email from a different person that was almost word-for-word the same as the first. Alarm bells go off, and after googling the first sentence of the email, I found a very similar one listed on a scam awareness site.

So anyone currently looking for a place, or who knows someone looking for a place to stay in Germany should be carefull.

the full text of the email is here:

&gt;Hello,
  First of all I'm sorry for the late reply but I had a lot to work and this is the time I could give you a message. From the site add, you could see, that the apartment located in:Hirtenstraße 7 ,10178 Berlin Mitte . It has 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom, 1 kitchen and 1 living room .
I am looking for someone to live in it, as soon as possible, because my company has won the auction for a project, in construction, for a building that will rise up in Nicosia / Cyprus. I am a civil engineer, so my accommodation period in Nicosia,Cyprus will be about 4 years. The renting period is from 2 months upto 4 years. As a result of this I want to rent, for this period, at this price and also to find the perfect person for my apartment. I`m the owner of the apt and it's like in the pics.
The apartment is furnished, but I have the option of sending all my furniture into storage if you want to bring your own (no extra costs). The rent for 1 month is 370 Euro, but you must to deposit 740euro/2months (for the whole apartment) including all utilities (water, electricity, Internet, cable, parking, air conditioning, fireplace, dishwasher, garbage disposal, microwave, refrigerator). You can move in the apt in the same day when you receive the keys. The only problem is that I`m the only person who has the keys but I hope that we will find a solution.
Thank you for your interest and I will look forward to hearing from you soon.       
Good luck,
Smith Jeanny

My mother was born in England so I'm currently working on getting dual citizenship so I can work in Germany without a Visa. This may take three months and I could be in Germany in February.

I have questions for you knowledgable /r/germany Redditors:

How easy is it to make friends in Germany?  How would you suggest doing this.  While it's going to be great to be with my girlfriend, I don't want to smother her.  I also like to be independent.  I'm working on learning German with the help of Michel Thomas and I'm guessing when I'm immersed in it I'm going to learn even faster.

How easy is it to get work teaching ESL in Germany?  I've checked out businesses and I get the impression they only offer freelance work.

If I don't get my dual citizenship before I need it, how easy is it to get a Visa?  

Is there any advice you can offer me?

I have a pretty big problem and I'm not really sure what to do.

I work for a large German chain and I'm being repeatedly harassed (verbally and physically on a daily basis) by my co-workers.

I guess I should begin by mentioning that I'm male, as are all of the offenders.

The harassment includes:

* 
calling me ""asshole"" and faggot"" (in german, of course: arschloch and schwuchtel)
* 
 grabbing my ass and dick
* 
 punching me in the chest/arms
* 
 hugging me against my will
* 
 pinching my nipples
* 
one of them grabbed my hand and forced it against his erect dick
* 
asking if they can ""fuck me"" after work
* Generally screaming at me and intimidating me.


All of the above happens pretty much daily (except for the erection incident, which was thankfully a one off).

There are about 4 people who engage in this type of behavior, and all of us work in extremely close quarters (restaurant kitchen). I work eight hours alone with these people, nobody else.

If I complain to my main boss it would effectively annihilate my working relationship with these people and make things extremely uncomfortable. 

I would be ostracized and basically laughed at by the entire restaurant.

I haven't said anything or complained because I need this job (badly) and the people harassing me have been there much longer than me. Also, the people harassing me are basically the entire kitchen staff, and if they were fired I would be the only one left. 

I'm also a afraid of violent retribution if I complain. One of my co-workers said ""go ahead, make a complaint with the police, I know where you live"".

Anyway, it's started to effect my mental and physical health to such a degree that I dread getting out of bed in the morning. The entire situation has thrown me into a deep, unrelenting depression. I've started drinking enormously unhealthy amounts as a coping mechanism. 

In short, I'm a mess.

I don't have many friends here in Germany, and I can't really talk to anyone about this because, quite frankly, I'm ashamed and embarrassed.

I also live in a small town, and jobs are scarce. I'm fortunate to have an income. I can't just quit.

I'm really at a loss and I don't know what to do.

I guess my question is twofold. What are my options legally? And what are my options health-wise?

Honestly, my health is my main concern at the moment. The aforementioned depression and potential alcoholism is alarming and scary.

Should I go to my hausarzt tomorrow morning, tell him everything, and ask for a krankenschein due to stress/mobbing? Will he even give me one?

I'm never sick and I always show up on time, but I'm worried they'll fire me if I show up with an extended krankenschein.

Also, assuming my hausarzt writes me off as sick, what do I tell my boss when I call in? 

Am I legally required to tell my boss the reason for my absence? If not, what should I say?

And then, after that's taken care of, what are my legal options? Should I contact an employment lawyer? Should I contact the chain's HQ? My local arbeitsamt? 

The whole situation is really horrible, and I'll greatly appreciate any advice.

Some facts: I'm an EU citizen (not German), I'm ""festangestellt"" and my probezeit is over.

I've been in Germany as an exchange student for nearly a year now, and  I think it's important for every exchange student to learn as much about their host country as possible. That way they can compare it their own country. With the American election coming up (can you guess where I'm from?), I've been trying to understand how exactly politicians are elected to the Bundestag. Here's what I've got so far:

1.  The Bundestag has a baseline of 598 seats, but that number may change depending on the number of ""overhang seats"" (oder Überhangmandate auf Deutsch).  

2. Every German national who's 18 years old or over AND has resided in Germany for at least three months is eligible to vote. There's no registration process like in the US. 

3. Every German who's eligible to vote has two votes.

4. The first vote is pretty straightforward. You vote for a politician to represent your local constituency (of which there are 299 in the whole country) in a first-past-the-post election. The first 299 seats in the Bundestag are filled this way.

The second vote is where my confusion starts. I understand that you vote for a party, and that the parties receive seats depending on what percentage of the second vote they won. For example, Party A received 15% of the second vote, they receive 15% of the seats. However, when they calculate the number of seats Party A should receive, do they use 15% of 299 (the other half of remaining seats)? Do they use 15% of the total seats (598)? I tried crunching the numbers in the Wikipedia article [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bundestag), but the numbers wouldn't add up. 

Another thing that confuses me is the 5% mandate (or three directly-elected politicians in the first vote). I understand that parties need 5% of the second vote to be represented in the Bundestag. However, I've also read that any politician directly elected in the first vote is guaranteed a seat. So say that the NPD manages to get one politician to represent a constituency in the Bundestag. That one NPD politician is guaranteed a seat, yet the party met neither of the requirements to be represented. What happens in this case?

Anyway, so far that's about as far as I've gone. Any useful answers would be appreciated.

 First of all, the roads.  Your country has the most impeccable and immaculate roads that I have ever had the delight to drive. 

 Second, your history.  As an American we have a very short history only going back a few hundred years.  In Germany we visited cities that were founded in 16 bc.  This was a remarkable experience to see the foothold of man-kinds' civilization. 

Your delicious food was a treat that left every meal with a smile.  Along the trip my wife and I had an inside joke of requesting ""your meats and your cheese"".  Germany, you did not disappoint.

The landscape of Germany is the most beautiful that we have ever experienced.  From the rolling hills with pockets of little towns, to the zugspitza in the background and cows grazing by the road, your country is truly magnificent.  We took over 3000 pictures!

Finally, and most importantly, you are a friendly and welcoming people.  We made a point to know the basics of the language, but when it was clear that we were American, English was spoken.

I want to travel around a bit and have no set itinerary. I'd like to visit Berlin, Munich, Nuremberg and more and I have to admit that the array of train options has left me a bit overwhelmed! 

I tried looking to add up prices of round trip fares on bahn.de and it looks like anywhere from ~€50-90 per trip to some of the cities that I listed above, does that sound correct? If so would it make sense to get the Deutschland-Pass? Does anyone have experience using one of them? It seems like a good deal for €309 for unlimited rail travel for a month... am I interpreting the description correctly?

Any help that you might be able to provide would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

I am currently facing a bit of a dilemma regarding our close friend who happens to be particularly racist towards Germans and people of Germanic heritage.  I personally find his behaviors unacceptable.  To give to some examples, he frequently makes racist remarks towards Germans and brags about how his grandfather (of British ancestry) is his biggest hero for killing Germs (as he puts it) and how he wishes that the world war II would have dragged on for a bit longer for the nuclear weapons to have been used against German people.  On top of his deplorable remarks &amp; racist views, last week at a starbucks, he interrupted a gentleman on the phone speaking German by calling him a nazi after which the poor gentleman proceeded to leave the cafe with a blushed face.  I never felt so embarrassed to be his friend and to be quite honest, I do not wish him to accompany us on our upcoming trip to Germany but since he is an essential part of our group, we have no choice but to bring him with us.  Oddly enough, he says he's looking forward to this trip since it will present him many ""opportunities"" to openly be hostile to German folks, i.e. he's told us that he's going to pose as a Hitler with a fake mustache and do countless other stupid things.  I am personally very worried that he's outrageous behaviors will put us in bad spots and I did confront him about this but he's adamant that we won't be disturbed in anyway since we're ""Murican's"" and just to get that message across, he's going to wear ""America F'ck Yea!"" shirt.  At this point, I am lost as to what I should do or how I can persuade him to limit his stupid actions.  Any advice reddit?

Edit: I tried to appeal to his faith by playing the ""be a good christian card"" but to no avail

Edit2: I have less than 3 weeks to turn him around completely or to somehow persuade him not to go!

Edit3: Update! I just exchanged texts, trying to figure out his deep rooted hatred for the Germans.  Apparently, he hates Germans because he thinks that they all rub fecal matter on their skin or something after he came across one such video on the internet.  I am currently persuading him that he shouldn't go if this is indeed his reasoning (since it will be unhygienic for him) but at the same time, I don't want to further concrete his stupid logic.

Edit4: I called up my other friends in the group and shared my concerns, even through they are already well aware. We are going to speak to him tomorrow as nicely as possible and tell him that if he truly cares about us then he would come to his senses, at least for the duration of our trip.  Crossing my fingers that it'll go well.

Edit5: I am at his house and we're going to be leaving in an hour to all meet up for a ""lunch"".  Frack, the first thing I notice when I saw him is his stupid ""Germany Back2Back WorldWar Loser"" T-shirt.  Wish us luck in putting some sense into his head or convincing him not to go completely!
-- Also, thank you for all your advice.  We will definitely get the message across that his stupid behaviors will not accompany him to ruin the trip for the rest of us--

Edit5: We finally persuaded him to stop being so racist and ignorant.  He'll be joining us for our upcoming trip with a good attitude.  Thank you for all your input!",,False,,t5_2qi4z,1369018619.0,,,True,t3_1ej7w5,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/1ej7w5/regarding_my_racist_friend/,

I think most people know the joke - it's the one about the German coast guard getting a distress call from an English ship. The ship cries, ""Help, we are sinking!"" and the Germans reply, ""Hmm... vat exactly are you sinking?"" 

See, when I first heard this joke, I thought it was a joke about grammar and syntax - that the Germans thought the English were declaring that they were sinking an object. However, I recently heard the punch-line delivered in a different way. In this joke the reply is, ""Vat are you sinking about?"" This makes it a joke about accents - that the Germans mistook ""sinking"" for ""thinking.""

So has anyone else heard this joke before? What did you think the punch-line was?

Thank you for your help and I apologize if this is the wrong subreddit for this question.

My mom bought a bunch of salt from OBI (3 50lb bags) and asked if someone could help her put them in her car. The lady who was helping her out looked at her like she was an idiot so my mom decided to tough it out herself. Unfortunately, she ended up hurting herself by falling, so she walked back and asked for help again.

The lady begrudgingly sent help and the individual who ended up helping her was extremely rude about it. The bags were tossed into the vehicle haphazardly and my mom had to shove a few of them in even further to get the trunk to close.

Is it not good manners to ask store personnel for help carrying heavy items?

Also, I would have helped my mom carry the items except I was not there to assist. This story was told to me after the fact.

tl;dr: Mom asked for help carrying heavy items to her car from a hardware store. She was given help only after hurting herself and they were rude about it.

Follow-up and penultimate confirmations.,Gamerosays,27,5,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/v7vbz/heidelberg_meetup_this_weekend_for_reddits_global/,"Guten Tag, y'all. So for those that have been keeping score, this weekend is the Heidelberg meet-up. We've got participants coming from all over... Frankfurt, Karlsruhe, Bamberg, usw.

We're sticking to the plan of the 7pm meet-up at Bismarckplatz. It's pretty central, easy to find, large, and a 5 minute Strassenbahn ride from the Hbf. 

Some things I wanted to get from the participants:

Are you guys football fans? Should I try to find us a place to watch the game? The options are plentiful, and the place I wanted to check out first will probably have it (as most bars/restaurants will). For those that are interested, the game will be the winner of Group C (Likely to be Spain) versus the runner-up of Group D (Likely to be France or England). Today and tomorrow's games will confirm it.

Secondly, is anyone deathly against smoke? Some of the places around here are really awesome, but still allow smoking in the establishment (Ginsburg, Reichsapfel, Destille). If there are, we can seek to avoid places like that.

Also, I assume everyone is a drinker and that the night will consist of drinks, bullshitting about reddit, and generic back and forth of the nerdy variety. 

""Have you heard of THIS subreddit? No way! That sounds awesome! What's your handle! Did you see that OAG meme? Hilarious! PM me and we'll hang out."" etc etc etc...

If there are any non-drinkers, we can try and accommodate. However, most everything of culture that Heidelberg has to offer is closed by 7. 

If there are any reluctant to travel alone, I can meet up with some of you at the train station considering that's how a few of you seem to be coming into town. We can meet at 6:30, chit-chat, and grab a street car down to Bismarckplatz to meet with the rest. 

Let me know if anyone is interested in the earlier Hbf meet-up and I'll make a point to run down there first. 

Sometime Thursday or Friday, I'll make one last post to say who to look out for (i.e. my outfit). Be prepared to answer when the narwhal bacons! Also, I'd like to get a roll-call of all participants so we don't leave anybody behind! 

Any questions? Just ask in the thread! Too shy? PM me! More details and discussion can also be found at the meet-up page. I'd prefer answering 1000 questions over hearing about 1 redditor left behind, so ask away!

**tl;dr** - See you Saturday at 7pm. Bismarckplatz. Earlier arrivals can let me know. Look out on Thursday or Friday for a final roll-call and a full description of the meet-up place as well as a description of my garb so you can be on the look-out!

Unfortunately though, I've been having a hard time finding such thing, so I suppose this is just not a common practice as it is for instance with the english series/movies (there are always english subtitles available).

So my question for the fellow german redditors is: do you actually know any tv series available in a dvd/blu-ray package with german subtitles, worth to see/buy? I have preference for tv series cause they're much more bang for the bucks (ie, I would have dozens of hours of content to see), but if you happen to know any good movie with german subtitles you may mention it as well :)

If you can educate me on rules pertaining to portrayals of violence or pornography, I'd also be interested.

As I understand it, it would be permissible to show a swastika in a historical/educational context, such as on wikipedia, but not as a political symbol (e.g. at a demonstration).

Are there legal distinctions for ""culture"" (e.g. books, films, paintings)?  Is there some sort of rule about when such cultural or artistic portrayals are acceptable and when not?  (I.e. ""parody is ok, a film in a historical setting is OK, but glorification is not""?)  Who decides this?  I noticed that _[Iron Sky](http://www.ironsky.net/)_ is actually premiering at the Berlinale, which surprised me a bit.

How does Germany handle, for example, World War II artifacts sold at flea markets?  It's my understanding that these are banned in France.

How about computer games?  I seem to recall Wolfenstein 3D being pulled because it showed swastikas.

Do such laws apply to Nazi imagery and/or items in particular, or more broadly to some sort of ""hate speech""?

I went to school in Göppingen, Baden - Wütenberg when I was a kid during the mid 90ies. We used to learn German from a book that had a character in it whose name started with ""Q"" (and it was used to teach us the letter ""Q"" on the relevant chapter.)

Guten Tag Deutschland!

I'm a 21 years old Canadian, and I'm considering moving to Germany.

I Have a Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering, and I want to get my Master's Degree from a German University. 

I am not planning on doing this right away. I will make my move in about 2-3 years time, So I will have learned a decent amount of German, and a lot of money saved up.

I'm considering these Universities:

* RWTH Aachen
* TU Berlin
* TU Darmstadt
* University of Karlsruhe
* TU München


My questions are:

* which of the cities, in which the universities above are located, is the best to live in? in terms of cost of living, awesome night life, friendliness, not boring. I will visit Germany in the future to see for myself, but for now I want to know what you guys think.

* Which part of Germany (state, or City) is the best for the Engineering Sector? What is the Average salary for Mechanical engineers? And how is the job market?

* I heard around the internet that Bavaria is very different from the rest of Germany, and it is very disliked. Is this true? How are foreigners treated here (or in any other part of Germany for that matter)?


Sorry for the long post, I just want to get all the information.

Needless to say, I am looking for someone to cook the breakfast of his memories for him and maybe even have someone sit and talk with him/reminisce about Germany for a bit...

I've posted on Craigslist (with a couple of unhelpful return emails) and can't post it in our city's subreddit (bay area/oakland) because he checks/posts there often. What do I do?!

I'm willing to pay someone up to $100 to cook (as long as it's authentic!) but can't figure out what to do. Can you help a sister out?! I REALLY want this to be home cooked - not just bought at a local German specialty store...

Is there anything that you believe is ESSENTIAL in any German breakfast? Any cool German related things that I could give him that would enhance this experience? Any pro tips on tracking down an individual who can help me accomplish this for him? 

Any help would be MUCH appreciated!

How would a €40000 gross income be split up?  
€3333 a month, or do you have any bonuses (e.g. Christmas bonus) that are part of your annual salary?
