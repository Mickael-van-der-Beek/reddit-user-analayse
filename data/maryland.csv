Personally, I've been hearing some apathy about the candidates at the Federal level, and I'll just say that that's fine, but here in Maryland we have a very important ballot initiative, Question 6:

&gt; Establishes that Maryland’s civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license, provided they are not otherwise prohibited from marrying; protects clergy from having to perform any particular marriage ceremony in violation of their religious beliefs; affirms that each religious faith has exclusive control over its own theological doctrine regarding who may marry within that faith; and provides that religious organizations and certain related entities are not required to provide goods, services, or benefits to an individual related to the celebration or promotion of marriage in violation of their religious beliefs.

This is a chance to make a serious difference for the better and fix a long-standing wrong.

Voting ""yes"" for Gay Marriage is a win-win scenario - The language specifically protects the religious rights of churches to apply their own standards, while the separation of church and state is maintained, allowing the State to provide equal treatment under the law. Gays get to marry; Some churches will continue to do what they're already doing now, while other churches get legal recognition for their gay congregants' marriages that their straight congregants' marriages already have.

IMHO, staying home this election day, or voting ""no"" is basically like showing up at your friends' wedding and knocking out the officiant.

Time is running out to register to Vote. Similar initiatives have always failed to produce the right outcome, most recently in North Carolina. Very uncool, North Carolina. We have to do better than North Carolina did (and here's hoping they give it another shot before too long, and get it right).",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,1348533769.0,,,True,t3_10f4yn,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/10f4yn/register_to_vote_now_so_you_can_vote_yes_on/,

Well I got my first letter and bill from them today, and it was for $60, of which $50 was administration fees. The administration fees are apparently penalty fees they tag on when your toll is 30 days past due. 

This came as a major shock since I had not received a first bill for which I could delay payment for 30 days and then receive the bill with late fees.

So I call up EZPass and they put me on hold for 15 minutes and then I talk to some lady and tell her this is the first bill I've received, can you waive the admin fees and then I'll pay the tolls. She says that the first bill was sent out April 20th. I say well this is the first one I've received. Without missing a beat she says they will only waive 80% of the fees, so I agree and pay my $20 bill since I didn't feel like fighting this thing and having it go to collection.

Later I talked to my dad who also sometimes uses the ICC and he said he got a huge bill from them with the same admin fees. Same story, no first bill.

I also spoke to my friend's dad and he ALSO had the same thing happen where he got a huge bill with admin fees and no first bill. 

All 3 of us have different addresses and vehicle registrations. While I and my dad don't have accounts, my friend's dad does. All together it just seems too fishy to have been a coincidence. I'm trying to see if other Marylanders have been affected by this company and their bullshit scam.

I looked it up and there are lots of reports about it happening in New Jersey, but nothing for Maryland yet except for a few reviews here and there. 

I want to contact whoever I can to get this brought to light and see where it goes from there. So if you have a story or know someone who has had this happen, please either message me or post in this thread. 

I would also appreciate you all upvoting this for visibility since I want as many people who may have been affected by this scam to see it and get their stories in.

In short, if you want a handgun, receiver, silencer, or AOW, you're blown. MSP is putting off the completion of 77rs for months. You can still purchase such items, but don't expect to see it for a few months. It's taken people more than 10 weeks to get their regulated items, when the maximum wait is 7 days. 

Maryland Shall Issue has filed a lawsuit against the MSP for the unjustified wait time extension when the law states that the maximum wait time is 7 days and on the 8th day, the dealer may release said item at their own discretion.

**UPDATE:** Maryland Shall Issue has reached an agreement with the Maryland State Police that dealers may release handguns and ""other"" to customers at their own discretion without fear of penalty.

1375395232.0,42,self.maryland,1jiwrr,"""Folks, we don’t want your money. We just want people to slow down in school zones. "" -Charles County Sheriff's Office.",GiJoeyVA,49,7,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/1jiwrr/folks_we_dont_want_your_money_we_just_want_people/,"Good afternoon folks…..by now, we’re pretty sure you’ve heard the news… We are temporarily suspending all automated speed cameras in our county…we have three. Here’s the issue:



During the initial installation process, when the camera pad sites were built (these are the cement slabs on which the cameras are placed), the westbound pad site on Berry Road near Jenifer Elementary School was placed outside of the school zone signs…. therefore, it did not meet state compliance. 



So, when it was pointed out to us, we immediately shut the camera off, validated the concern and then made a decision to turn off all speed cameras so that we can review the entire program - from top to bottom - to make sure everything is in compliance. Here are some questions and answers that might help you: 



•	What camera sites are affected? Only one: The westbound side of Berry Road at Jenifer Elementary School. 

•	Are we fixing the issue? Yes. 

•	Will you get a refund if you already paid a citation from the westbound Berry Road site? Yes. 

•	How long will that take? We’re not sure, but we will do our best to get this taken care of. We are working with the county and the vendor to determine how to best deal with this process as quickly and accurately as possible. 

•	What do I do if I received a citation from the westbound Berry Road site but haven’t yet paid it? Don’t pay it. If you verify that your citation is indeed from that site (the location is clearly marked on the citation), do not pay the fine; it’s that simple. 

•	Please note: All other fines from any other speed enforcement site should be paid. 

•	Are there still speed cameras on the roads? No, just the boxes. The cameras have been removed. 

•	Are we looking at the compliance of other pad sites? Yes, and they are all in compliance. 

•	What about Wade Elementary? It’s in compliance…but we’re working with the county to make it less confusing with all the lights.

•	I still have questions, who do I call? We have some wonderful employees who will do their best to answer any questions you may have. Starting on Friday, Aug. 2 and then again M-F, from 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. (except holidays), our staff can be reached at (301) 609-5971 or (301) 609-5972. 



Now, we know this post will generate lots of talk and everyone definitely has an opinion. Some good, some not so good and a few in between. We’ve come to realize people either love the cameras or hate them. Usually, it’s about equal. 



Often we hear the cameras were put in place to “make money.” Sadly, they do. They don’t have to though. In fact, we’d rather they didn’t. The goal of using these cameras is to reduce drivers’ violations of the speed limits in school zones to the point where the costs of the system greatly outweigh the income from citations. That’s when we’ll know the cameras have done their job.



Prior to the cameras, the Agency had received numerous complaints about speeding in and near school zones. We would hear from parents, neighbors, staff, and even kids. Colonel Joseph Montminy, now a retired CCSO commander, did a lot of research about speed cameras and determined automated cameras would be the best way to reduce speeding in school zones. 



We set the program up, sent out a press release, had our local media give it great coverage and even gave people a two month window to get use to the cameras. And, we even went so far as to make public the location of the cameras every week on the Agency facebook page. 



Folks, we don’t want your money. We just want people to slow down in school zones. It might take a while, but with the use of cameras, all of us will eventually get in the mindset that we are entering a school zone and we better slow down. 



In the meantime, we are working on getting you information as to how and when the refunds will occur. We will also consider any concerns you have while we are doing the review. Please keep the remarks clean for our readers and let’s work together to make our county safe for pedestrians, school kids and motorists. We do thank you for your patience…and remember, please drive gently.""

Below is a quotation of the proposed law as it is written on the ballot:
&gt;Establishes the boundaries for the State's eight United States Congressional Districts based on recent census figures, as required by the United States Constitution

At first glance, this would seem like an obvious thing to vote ""for"" since the phrase ""as required by the United States Constituion"" is used. However, it's actually a bit misleading.

It's worth noting that while the US Constitution requires a census be taken to allocate an appropriate number of representatives per state in the House of Representatives, [Congressional Districting is never explicitly mentioned](http://www.usconstitution.net/constnot.html#condist), but aside from that, the actual issue is the way the various counties of Maryland are divided. Both the old and new maps can be found [here](http://planning.maryland.gov/Redistricting/redistrictingIMap.shtml). Rather than making the divisons between districts simpler and more sensical, the new boundaries make them even worse. Parts of the primarily Republican Washington and Frederick counties are mixed in with Democratic Montgomery County, and District 3 is even more of a mess than it was before (one of the most convoluted districts in the nation, according to [one report](http://marylandreporter.com/2012/10/03/maryland-has-least-compact-congressional-districts-in-nation/)). From what I've seen, informed persons from [both parties](http://marylandreporter.com/2012/10/15/montgomery-county-democrats-organize-opposition-against-congressional-districts/) are against this redistricting as it splits communities in an unnecessary manner and damages the voting power of Maryland citizens, but I want to make sure people know what this question actually is about, especially since the phrasing of it seems rather misleading and it seems there's been a lack of coverage on this question. (Most opinion polls I saw focused on questions 4, 6, and 7, skipping this one entirely.)

Hopefully I've managed to bring this issue to light for people who weren't aware of it (or at least spark enough interest for them to look into it further) without boring those who are aware of it, and I hope everyone has a great Election Day tomorrow. :)",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,False,,,True,t3_12o1mz,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/12o1mz/the_election_and_the_potentially_misleading/,

I've gone through hell and back in the last eight months or so. My wife left me in October and I tried to commit suicide at Christmas. I seek friendship/companionship and really want to get back out there and enjoy myself. I have a hard time with social anxiety; so it prevents me from putting myself out there usually. I'm trying to make a change. I'm a guy in my mid-20's, into a wide range of activities and I'm pretty much down to do anything. I'm in the Annapolis area but willing to travel. Any kind of response would be greatly appreciated.

Edit: Thank you so much for your steady replies and kind words. I didn't think it would get this many hits.

1350485626.0,35,self.maryland,11mr75,Just wanted to share something to everyone in the process of buying a home in Maryland.,gizram84,46,11,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/11mr75/just_wanted_to_share_something_to_everyone_in_the/,"Maryland has a ""transfer tax"" associated with all home sales.  You basically have to pay between 0.5% and 2.0% (based on county) of the price of the home to the government, on top of the property taxes, just for the privilege of purchasing your home.

I came from out of state, so this was very foreign to me.

Unless otherwise specified, this tax is to be split 50/50 between the buyer and the seller.

Anyway, on to my point.  Fannie Mae has declared themselves exempt from paying any transfer taxes.  If you are buying a foreclosed home, or any other home that Fannie Mae owns, please keep your eye out for this!

I noticed on my settlement that the entire transfer tax was being charged to me.  It was not split 50/50.  I was told that Fannie Mae was exempt from paying it.  I accepted it at first, because I wasn't sure of the Maryland laws, but eventually, only 3 days before closing, I decided to call the Title company to ask about it.

It turns out that even if Fannie is exempt, that does *not* mean that the buyer is responsible for paying Fannie's share of the tax.  I fought it and saved myself a lot of money.

I was very upset with my representation for not discovering this for me, and I thought that there might be other people out there who got screwed by this.

Please make sure to look over your settlement (HUD) sheet and review all items.  Please make sure to carefully look at the transfer tax info too!

Thanks for listening.

**tl;dr:**  If you buy a home that Fannie Mae owns, make sure you still pay only half of the transfer tax.  Just because they are exempt doesn't mean you have to pay their share.",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,False,,,True,t3_11mr75,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/11mr75/just_wanted_to_share_something_to_everyone_in_the/,

I work for Maryland's Office of Tourism.  I'm an avid redditor.  I want to use your good ideas (especially with Digital Marketing) to make Maryland more competitive in the tourism marketplace. 

EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS HONEST HELPFUL RESPONSE.  YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST.

EDIT 2: Some info from my comment below:

I'm a digital marketing manager for DBED's Office of Tourism.

Our official website is visitmaryland.org - NOTE: This site was developed before I started working for Tourism (it is 4+ years old) - I am constantly battling to move it forward.

I have subscribed to this subreddit for a while and I think you all have good ideas and topics of discussion.

I don't think any other states use reddit's awesome ideas, but I know where the smart people are--- right here!

Another note - Tourism is HUGELY important in our state - it is the 4th largest employer in the state with over 130,000 jobs. We are also up year over year, above national averages.

Looking forward to your involvement!


Also, If you want to be involved on our social channels (I manage the strategy for it) - please join us on twitter, facebook, etc...

1366098141.0,25,self.maryland,1cg733,Gambling laws effecting amateur video gamers who are not playing for money.,efowler4,37,12,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/1cg733/gambling_laws_effecting_amateur_video_gamers_who/,"I am a 19 year old college student in southern Maryland. And I have recently become adapt at a computer game known as Starcraft 2. 

When I attempted to explore playing the same in a more formal competitive setting I ran into a few snags. 

When trying to register for a amateur Starcraft 2 tournament with MLG (largest provider of professional gaming in the US)
http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/

I soon realized that all of the available tournaments that i could register with had this clause in the rules section.

""Eligible for US Residents only. Not valid in Arizona, Connecticut, Maryland, North Dakota, and Vermont.""
http://gamebattles.majorleaguegaming.com/pc/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/tournament/bronzesilvergold-hots-rumble/rules

I wondered to myself what about me living in Maryland possibly have to do with me not being able to participate in a free and casual online video game tournament that had no money involved. 

By chatting with a member of the support team for the tournament I was informed that Maryland did indeed have laws that conflicted with with the nature how how these tournaments were run.

After further research I realized that even though the tournament didn't cost money to enter, it did have a prize of a certain number of an imaginary online currency used only my MLG that you can use to register for higher level tournaments.
https://support.majorleaguegaming.com/customer/portal/articles/187370-what-are-credits-what-is-the-cost-

By now I have deduced that not only can these 'MLG credits' not only be obtained by winning tournaments, but also bought (so that some players could 'buy' their way in and by-pass lower level tournaments).

And even though these online credits are only used virtually, because they can be bought that gives 1 MLG credit a very specific monetary value.

Upon further investigation I realized that by any interpretation of Maryland's gambling laws these MLG credits would be considered 'Gambling tokens'
http://www.gambling-law-us.com/State-Laws/Maryland/

And since gambling on skill events (fighting/sports) is illegal. Then gambling these virtual 'Gambling tokens' based off of your Starcraft 2 skill must also be illegal. 

ACTUAL POINT:

I am very frustrated that my simple recreational activities are thwarted by state law in this way. I don't think people being effected as I have was the intention of any of the gambling laws, and perhaps, maybe, something can be changed slightly to allow for us friendly computer geeks to casually compete online in this way without having to lie about what state we live in.

P.S.

Regardless of the problem I am having, anti-gambling laws are anti-fun laws. And people should be able to spend their money how they please.

Well, the dryer has stopped turning again.  I'm not sure what I'm entitled to, because he's made it pretty clear that he's not going to pony up for it anymore, and said that it was because we weren't using it right, so he wasn't going to have it repaired again.  
Do I have any rights, as a tenant?  Can I demand that, if he's not going to fix it, he has to remove it and block up the holes in the wall? If I purchase a dryer, can I take it with me when we move?

1362715600.0,21,self.maryland,19w50u,I need serious advice. I am 22 and supporting my entire family.  My dad needs a job that helps my family.. ,marylandhelp,27,6,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/19w50u/i_need_serious_advice_i_am_22_and_supporting_my/,"It pains me to have to write about something like this on a forum, but we live in this day &amp; age where I guess it is more acceptable.  So here it goes...

My family has suffered a lot of turmoil over the years because one of my siblings had to get serious surgery as a baby to survive (and a few more surgeries continuing into his youth).  Medical bills were astronomical.. actually, astronomical is an understatement.  Since my mother had the better insurance, my father has had to quit his jobs many times to care for my sibling; take him to all his appointments, etc.  I'm sure you all heard of ""pre-existing condition"" in insurance, well.. my mom could then never quit HER job, because no insurance companies would cover my sibling because of all of his medical problems.  Talk about a dilemma.  Other family crises occurred and my dad always had  to be the one to help out, because my mother couldn't quit her job, she had the benefits.  My dad finally had a great job in home improvement but when 9/11 happened he was laid off.  He does not have a college degree, even though I personally think he is a brilliant man, kind, and reliable, so it was hard for my old man to find a job.  Since 9/11 he has been a self-employed handyman, doing everything from paint jobs to other home improvement.  The problem is, my father isn't the most organized and he is also very old school.  He has people he needs to bill from over 4-6 months ago, and doesn't have the time to compile and send out his bills while doing current work.  It is very hard for my parents to make ends meet bill-wise.  Now that I and my siblings are older, my dad has more free time because I can help take my sibling to his doctor appointments.  My dad would be a perfect candidate for a 9-5 job now.

As a 22 year old, I just recently graduated college (I'm a first generation college student) and was never informed of all of their problems.  They hid it from me, ashamed.  But now it is nipping us in the butt.  They have so many bills backed up that they are behind on, I am afraid we are going to lose our house.  This scares the living crap out of me.

I've tried really hard to help them as much as I could.  I have been working on my own company out of my basement and I am now making more than I ever had in a real job.  On top of trying to pay off my $100,000+ in college debt I am giving every single penny back to them to pay for all their bills and try to get them caught up. 

I finally was able to get in touch with some debt collectors today, and it turns out they are over $50,000 in debt and may lose the house.  It's only a matter of time.  Because of my good credit score from running my own company I am hoping to take out a loan for them to get them situated but I know this will not fix the problem.  I know my dad cannot handle being a handyman anymore.  He needs something where he doesn't need 1,000 tools and personally hand write all his bills.  Literally, any job where he is paid a wage and issued a paycheck is better at this point.  He just needs some uniformity in his life.  I think that will alleviate their financial distress and I also plan on working with some financial advisers to get them set up on a monthly affordable budget.   It also makes me want to cry to think that my parents are nearing retirement age and are about to lose their only home.  They are good people that just are too in over their head. I'm sure many other people are in the same crisis right now, and I feel for you and am right there with you.  But I have no idea what to do.  I am calling a foreclosure lawyer tomorrow and also meeting with a bank to try and get a loan to help them, but I am just so scared about this uncertainty.

So a few things to close this up:
1.  If ANYONE out there is hiring, please let me know! My dad is SUPER AWESOME!  He's shy, but he's a very humble bald-headed man who is very intelligent.  
2.  If any of you could help me figure out where to get a loan, I have no idea where to start.  Do I have to get multiple small ones?  Or one big one?  Does it even work that way?
3.  Has anyone been foreclosed upon?  What are some things I should do?  Should I call the attorney?

I am just asking for any assistance or advice.  We are a community, Maryland.  Please help me and my family, I really appreciate it.",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,False,,,True,t3_19w50u,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/19w50u/i_need_serious_advice_i_am_22_and_supporting_my/,

1329428526.0,21,self.maryland,psvwn,A Letter to a MD State Senator Regarding Same-Sex Marriage,stevelikes2curse,26,5,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/psvwn/a_letter_to_a_md_state_senator_regarding_samesex/,"Just over two weeks ago I sent the following letter to my representative in the Maryland State Senate, Christopher Shank, asking him to support the bill being considered by the general assembly that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state of Maryland:



Tuesday, January 31, 2012

Senator Shank,

My name is Steve Shives. I’m 31 years old. I’m a constituent of yours from Sharpsburg. My wife and I have lived here for the last six years. Before that I lived in Hagerstown, and before that I was raised in Clear Spring. I graduated from Clear Spring High School, and later attended Hagerstown Community College before moving on to finish my education just across the river at Shepherd University. I’m a registered voter, unaffiliated. I’m an atheist. And I’m a lifelong resident of Washington County, as are both my parents, as were both sets of grandparents.

There are two more things you should know before I go any further. First, I didn’t vote for you. Second, I’m writing to ask you to consider supporting Senate Bill 241, the Civil Marriage Protection Act. You’ve made no secret of your opposition to same-sex marriage in the past. Nevertheless, I would be derelict in my duties as a citizen if I didn’t at least attempt to change your mind. So here goes nothing.

Your current position on the issue of same-sex marriage would compel you to vote against SB 241. You would vote to continue to deprive our gay fellow Marylanders of the right to have their unions legally recognized by the state and to enjoy the benefits that come with such a recognition — benefits that you and I and all of our fellow straight Marylanders have taken for granted for generations. But consider whose interests you would be voting against. Gay Marylanders? Yes. But it’s more complex than that.

Vote against SB 241 and you’re also voting against the interests of men and women who, like my father and his father, have worn the uniform of the United States Armed Forces. Well before the recent repeal of the “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy — and long before the institution of that policy in the 1990s — gay Americans have served in our nation’s Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force and Coast Guard. Despite the hostility with which the majority of our society has treated them, despite the fact that they have been deprived of basic rights and privileges of citizenship for most of American history, millions of our gay fellow Americans have chosen to put their lives on the line, to kill and risk being killed, to defend the United States. Because until very recently their sexual orientation had to be kept a closely guarded secret, we will never know exactly how many gay men and women have fought and died under the flag of this country. We will never know how many of them are buried in our national cemeteries.

Cast your vote against SB 241 and you’ll be voting against the interests of many of your fellow Christians. There are millions of gay Americans who identify themselves as Christians. Some of them are open about their sexuality and attend churches that welcome and value them as the people they are, while others are forced by the attitudes of their fellow Christians to keep their sexual orientation a secret. They attend churches in our state every week. They place their money in collection plates, volunteer at pancake breakfasts and thrift shops, teach Sunday school classes and pray earnestly to the God they believe in, just the same as you. Despite the long-standing and ongoing animosity toward their orientation nursed by many members and leaders of the various denominations of their faith, gay Christians find the same things to value in their religion as I would imagine you do, Senator: love, charity, and forgiveness, to name a few.

Yes, a vote against the Civil Marriage Protection Act would be a vote against gay Marylanders, a constituency you have shown no interest in serving during your years in public office. That’s fine. You have the right to your own opinions and you must vote according to your own values and conscience, of course. But please be aware of what I’ve just told you. There is no gated wall separating the gay community from the rest of our state. The gay community is a part of our community, just the same as Maryland is a part of the United States, and you and I, as a conservative and a liberal, respectively, are a part of the larger communities of Marylanders, Americans, and humanity. Vote against allowing same-sex couples to enjoy the rights and privileges that come with a civil marriage and you are voting against men and women who have served in our military, worshipped in our churches, taught in our schools and universities, worn the uniforms of our state and local police departments, and served in our governments, some as members of your own party. They are a part of our community, and they always have been.

Senator, I — a married, heterosexual resident of District 2 — am asking you to vote for SB 241, the Civil Marriage Protection Act. I am asking this of you, even though I know it to be incongruent with your personal beliefs, because it is the just thing to do. It is the right thing to do.

I am not asking you to change your opinion on homosexuality. I am not asking your church to change its opinion on homosexuality. I am not advocating for the limit of free speech. I am not asking you to vote for a bill that would outlaw homophobia. Guaranteeing a right — the right to legally marry the partner of your choice — to a group of people who have long been denied it does nothing to harm those who have always enjoyed the right.

By voting for SB 241 you are harming no one. The rights of those who oppose gay equality in general and same-sex marriage in particular will not be infringed upon in the least. They, and you, will still be free to speak out against homosexuality as much as it suits you. The difference will be this: thanks in part to your vote, the gay citizens of this state will enjoy a measure of equal protection under the law that they have never known. They will be able to live their lives as they see fit, to conduct themselves as consenting adults according to their own consciences. This is no more than any citizen of a free country should expect. But no citizen of any free country should be expected to settle for any less.

If you’ve read this far, I want to thank you. You’re busy, now especially, and I appreciate you taking the time to hear me out. This is an important issue to me. I feel strongly that now is the time to take this necessary and long overdue step, to afford our gay fellow Marylanders the same rights and privileges that we straight Marylanders have always enjoyed. This is the right thing to do, Senator Shank. I hope you will be courageous enough to see beyond your own position and the narrow demands of your own political base, and do it.

Thanks again for your time.

Sincerely,

Steve Shives

I go to New Orleans every year for Mardi Gras to visit my family, and well...it's freaking Mardi Gras. So why do you care? This year I'm driving. I've decided I don't want to pay for a plane and that I want the experience of a road trip. My car is a 2003 Honda Accord and it has two open seats. I had these seats filled but just found out today the people backed out. My friend and I are at a loss for whom else to ask. So I'm asking you, r/Maryland. 

Fat Tuesday is Feb. 21st this year and I would like to drive down there the Friday before (17th) right after work and start the return the Saturday after. 

Well...naturally there will be some things I need; Qualifications if you will. 

* Must know or have a willingness to learn stick. I will more than likely drive the whole way but something may end up happening and I need the assurance that everyone in the car can at least figure out how to drive it.  


*  Everyone will have to meet up before hand to ensure we get along...We will be spending a week together as well as 19 hours in a car both ways. 

*  If we fill the car the gas money comes out to roughly $70. Housing once in NOLA will be covered but you will need to help with food as well. 

*  Must be 21 or over. I was on Bourbon street drunk out of my mind when I was 14 but I don't want to have to deal with someone who is un-able to attend events at certain bars or festivities. 

*  Please remember this is at the core a visit for me to my family. I see them once a year (usually) and we will be staying in their homes. Though I suppose if you decided to you could get a hotel, ride down, and do your own thing. 

*  This offer can be revoked at any time for any reason but I am an honest guy and if I find someone and tell them they can go, the spot is yours. 


I ask you leave any vague questions (times, distance, cost) in the comments section so all may see them limiting the number of them I get. If you are interested after the initial comment questions have been answered, you may PM me and we can go from there.

Boo Boo's owner passed away and the person in charge of the estate dropped him off at the shelter. He was scooped up by OBG Cocker Rescue and is currently crashing at my place.

HE IS THE SNUGGLIEST DOG EVER. :-)

If you want the kind of dog who sticks to you like Velcro and wants nothing more than to be by your side getting pets and scritches, Boo Boo is your dog.

He loves to run around in our fenced backyard but is just as happy snuggled on the couch with a human.

Of course, every dog has room for improvement. 

Boo Boo's big downside (for some folks) is that he is convinced that young children are the spawn of Satan. We're not sure what he experienced in his younger years to cement this belief, but he needs to be in a home without young children, live-in or visiting. Teenagers would be fine; he seems to view them as adults.

My two cats have holed up in the guest bedroom since Boo Boo thinks they are fun for chasing.

He is fine with my dog (female, another Cocker). When OBG adopts out a dog, you get a 2 week trial period to make sure your new family member gels with the current pups, so you'll have time to test drive Boo Boo and see how he does in your home. :-)

Interested? Send me a message.

Got more questions? I can answer those too!

Let's get Boo Boo a forever home!

The short is narrated (and partially sung) by a woman. It was created by animator Cosmo Anzilotti.

&gt;This short was said to be very frightening, as many people recount seeing it as children, and have posted their terrifying experiences on numerous forums. The short only aired a few times in the mid-to-late 70s, and has allegedly never aired since (although there have been multiple claims made that it did air in the late 90s/early 00s during the Spanish adaptation of Sesame Street called Plaza Sesamo, which was broadcast in Latin America).

4 percent on taxable income between $2,001 and $3,000.

I've got a few months until my lease here expires, but I figure that's enough time to get started scoping out rent in various areas.

Obviously, this is the Internet, you guys don't actually know me, and it's not a decision anyone else can make for me... but perhaps there are things I'm not considering, neighborhoods I should check out, that sort of thing.

Also, if anyone is likely to be needing a roommate in a few months (my lease is up in June, but the new job pays pretty well and it might be worthwhile to pay rent on two places for a month while I move stuff over), feel free to PM me (though I'm not sure yet if I'd rather live with people or alone).",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,False,,,True,t3_1axpkv,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/1axpkv/took_a_job_in_columbia_trying_to_figure_out_where/,

We are a couple in Harford County, MD. His name is Milo, and he is around 4 years old. He's a chihuahua-rat terrier mix, around 5.5 pounds (a little underweight). He is neutered and up to date on all shots (and Heartgard and Frontline), and is house- and crate-trained. He's playful and good with other dogs. He loves going for walks and cuddling with people (he would love to share a person's bed at night). He is not a barker, but he will whine when he wants something.

We put some pictures up at: http://imgur.com/a/5K7YM#0

As you can see, he's a sweetie pie who just needs some loving. No fee, but we need an interview before we can let him go.

In January I noticed my gas heat was not working very well in the house we recently moved into. I contacted a few HVAC services for a quote and chose Capitol Air Care. They came in and did an excellent job. There was a hole in an intake vent that was sucking in insulation which they quickly found and repaired. They cleaned the system from top to bottom. I gave the service men a credit card and signed the service paperwork. The problem I have is with their billing dept, they charged my card $7.50 instead of $750.00. I didn’t catch it myself, as it was the emergency credit card usually used for Vet bills. I paid it off without realizing the error.  Eight months later I get a phone call at 630 on a Friday night from a number I don’t recognize. I ignore it and when I check the voice mail it’s just a click. Then I immediately get a text message from a different unknown number saying, ‘please call as soon as possible. Ty.’ I call that number back and I recognize the voice of the woman who works the office for Capitol Air Care. She tells me I need to give her a credit card right now as I owe them the 750, very rude and unprofessional in my opinion. I tell her I don’t have that kind of money on a Friday night and I need to check the bank records on my end to make sure her claim is correct. The credit card I used in January had been paid off and cancelled so I had to call them and track down the old statement. After finding out they did indeed only charge me the 7.50, I called back to talk to the woman. I told her that I had confirmed the under charge but I was very dissatisfied with her customer service. I asked why it took eight months to find the error and why the need to call and text me at 630 on a Friday. She said the audit came because the employee in charge of accounts was under investigation. Again, she outright demanded a credit card to pay off the balance. I told her that the mistake was not my fault, and I would have to shuffle some credit card balances around and I would call her back on Monday and hung up the phone.

I’m going to call back on Monday and pay her off, but I doubt I will be calling them again for service. 

TL;DR Vendor dropped a decimal when charging my credit card and didn’t catch it for 8 month, then called me with an attitude with apology for their mistake.

First, a bit about me. I am an undergraduate student at the University of Maryland College Park (Go Terps!) studying history. I was born and raised in Anne Arundel County, just outside of Annapolis. Currently I am in the process of a large project for my immigration class about how immigrant food cultures shape and/or are changed by American culture and values. I took a spin on this topic, being the Marylander and lover of blue crabs that I am, and am studying the Maryland ""culture"" of crab feasts and the creation of a ""Marylander identity"" that is centered around a shared tradition. I would LOVE some input as I am short on secondary sources that have been written about this topic. What I am asking you to do, if you can spare a few minutes, is write a short response or PM with the following information:

* 1) Some initials/pseudonym by which I can identify you in my paper (if none is indicated, I will use your username)
* 2)Your age and how long you have lived in Maryland (or if you are no longer living in Maryland, how long you lived here and how long ago you left the area)
* 3)Whereabouts you live in Maryland (I will accept county, region ie Western, Southern, Eastern Shore and so on, or a specific city if you feel comfortable enough)
* 4)What, in your opinion, makes someone a TRUE Marylander? Or rather, is there such thing as a ""true"" Marylander?
* 5)Do you have any specific memories related to crab feasts/crabbing/etc? If so, what are they?
* 6)In your opinion, is there a ""crab culture"" or tradition in Maryland?
* 7)If you moved to Maryland and were not raised here, have you had an experience with eating/picking/crabbing for crabs? If so, what was this experience like? Do you feel more like you belonged to the regional ""culture"" after this experience? Were crabs presented to you as something that ""made"" a Marylander?
* 8) Is there anything else you would like to add pertaining to this topic?

**EDIT: Per request, here is a [Survey Monkey](http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/8DFXPDS) survey I created in order to collect responses. Feel free to share it with people you know who would have input on this topic. I greatly appreciate it!)**

I will accept answers to all, or some of these. I appreciate any and all responses. Help a college student out, please :) I welcome discussion on this topic as well, if you do not wish for me to quote you in my paper please indicate so in your post. I am really interested in people who have moved to Maryland after being raised elsewhere not just those who have lived here their whole lives, as this will be where I will drive my points home. So, tell your friends I suppose. THANKS IN ADVANCE, all those who reply :)

Edit:  It is interesting the result this post has gotten.  It has enlightened me as to why Maryland school systems are considered some of the absolute worst for children on the spectrum and why Maryland still has no autism mandate when 34 states do have one.  

People in MD are completely clueless when it comes to autism and the need for early intervention (before the age of 2) and ABA therapy for children of all ages (and how lacking health insurance and the MD school system is when it comes to autism) unless they have a child on the spectrum...those with children on the spectrum cannot get the therapies their children need and end up paying out of pocket (or have to watch their child regress).  They then are faced an uphill battle because people are completely clueless about autism, the therapies needed and early intervention.  

It is not anyone's problem or concern (and you get wtf does a 2 year old need speech therapy, why does a 2 year old need early intervention, why would you need a bed and a kitchen table when you can sleep and eat on the floor, why would your child need ABA therapy if you cannot afford it, etc) until they are in the same situation.  Then it is too late and you end up in the cycle we are in.",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,1356490210.0,,,True,t3_15e5y5,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/15e5y5/please_share_a_maryland_family_in_need/,

This legislation amended Section 9-503 of the State of Maryland Worker’s Compensation law to add Brain Cancer, Breast Cancer, Testicular Cancer, Multiple Myeloma, and Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma to the list of cancers that are presumed to be job-related and contracted in the course of duty as a fire fighter or paramedic. This law was slated to take effect on June 1, 2013.

In an attempt to stall this important legislation from taking effect, the Maryland Association of Counties (MACO) has solicited a number of elected officials to sponsor legislation that would delay implementation of these presumption protections for an additional two years. Within the last week, Senate Bill 681 and House Bill 1314 were filed and assigned Committee hearing dates. If enacted, these bills would halt the progress that firefighters  have made in helping ensure that firefighters who suffer from these cancers have the best treatment available and much needed financial assistance for their families.

I'm looking to go camping in the next week or two.  Ideally, I'd like to find a place that has a lake or river for swimming, is dog friendly and within a 2 hour drive of Rockville, MD.  My main consideration is privacy. I'd like a place that has a bathhouse but is still private.

The only problem is, they don't allow pets. I adopted Iris, a bloodhound/coon hound/mutt, from the Humane Society in Omaha, NE in 2007. She is very sweet, has never bitten anybody, and can run for miles and miles. She can be a bit needy, but that's pretty standard for a hound like her. One problem is she is very selective of the dogs she'll play nice with. Taking her to the dog park can be a nightmare sometimes. 

She has a very strong hunting instinct. One time I was letting her play in the front yard while I was doing yard work, and she started pulling chipmunks out of a hole. One by one she was pretty much eating them whole. She loves to chase rabbits and squirrels, though, I've never seen her catch any.

My wife and I have a 9 month old and Iris wouldn't dream of biting her. Iris doesn't like to play with my daughter, but she'll just quietly get up and move whenever my daughter crawls up to her. She is very smart (when she wants to be). She's house trained, kennel trained, and knows ""sit"" and ""down"". I've taught her to use a doggy door (in Omaha), and out here I've taught her to ring a bell that hangs from the doorknob whenever she wants to go outside.

It makes me sad to have to get rid of her, but it would break my heart even more to have to abandon her at a shelter. If I could find someone to take her it would make my wife and I very happy. I live in Southern Maryland, but I'm willing to drive wherever I have to to find a home for her.

**TL;DR: I'm out of a job and am moving into a place that doesn't allow pets. Please take my dog.**

It appears that Outback Steakhouse is considered ""Fine Dining"".  All chains and only a very few individually owned type places (We did find a good sushi place).  It makes me sad that we have to drive into the city or Alexandria to get really good food :(

And on the subject of food, 2 things come to mind.  First, why are there no Asian grocers around here????  I've been driving to H-Mart in Annandale to get my big bags of rice and Yan-yan.  Second, WHY are grocerys SO much more expensive here?  I moved up from Va. Beach, and the groceries at Safeway are easily 10-20% more expensive than they were at Harris Teeter.  Is it because they have to truck them inland farther?  I haven't found Giant much cheaper except on weekly sales items.


EDIT:  There seems to be some question about our sanity for moving here...well, my husband got a job in the Navy Yard and many of his coworkers lived in the area.  We'd heard pretty good things about the place from them.  We had to move pretty quickly, as our house in Virginia Beach sold so fast.  In retrospect, I wish we'd known some of the things we know now before moving.  But some things you do not find out til you've lived someplace for a while.  There are some nice things about the area..I mean, only 30 minutes from a major city, but I can still go out and play in the woods. The light pollution is much lower here than in VB so I see the most beautiful stars at night.  My hopes are to have enough equity in our house to be able to move in about 10 years to DC.  

Edit 2: I really need to see the positives of Waldorf.  Moving isn't going to be an option for a while so I need to see the pros as much as possible.

(Xpost from r/politics),crappy_healthcare,14,3,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/q97a8/this_is_whats_wrong_with_healthcare_in_the_united/,"(I have changed the names in this to keep it anonymous)... If you want more info, PM me.

Dear (State Senator/Delegate),

I am writing a possibly unusual request for direct help or suggestions for my brother, James Heckman.

Three weeks ago on February 3 2012, James underwent a complicated 12 hour spinal surgery to release fluid and pressure on his spinal cord, insert shunts in the spinal cord, extend rods and repair a fracture and perform extensive bone grafts. After the surgery James was unable to roll sit up, or get out of bed without extensive assistance from 2 therapists. Last fall James was walking independently with a walker, but was unable to stand after the surgery. The rods have limited his spine except for his neck. The surgeons and therapists recommended inpatient rehab within 3 days after surgery.

James has major medical health insurance with United Health Care through his mother's job with a policy that includes inpatient rehabilitation. However, UHC denied James, who is a 26 year old paraplegic, to go to rehab. UHC said he was appropriate to go to a nursing home, or go home from the hospital where we would have to do the best that we could on our own with possible home health services.

United Health Care has denied 4 appeals so far, including from the Chief Neurosurgeon from Ruby Hospital. James and my parents made the decision that he needs to go to Health South Moutainview as they, and the doctors and therapists, felt it was too risky to take him to a nursing home where they are not qualified to care for a spinal cord patient, or to take him home where he may not recover or develop complications. UHC states it is up the family to appeal the denial. They have 30 days to respond. In the meantime, what was James supposed to do? James is required to pay his expenses out of pocket for the rehab. With that in mind, he may not be able to stay as long as he needs to gain his independence. He has been at Health South for two weeks now and is making gains daily with therapy.

I am asking that you report this to local and state government, and please give any suggestions on how to fight this injustice. We are hoping that United Health Care will reverse their denial, but with the extensive communications from multiple professionals, it doesn't appear to be a mistake, but is a great injustice from the insurance company to save money.

James surgeons, doctors, and therapists are shocked and appalled by what has happened. I hope there is some way we can get the word out to people who care and get this large national insurance company to change the process of ""providing"" health care.

Very Sincerely, (sister)

Myself and another friend are helping him find a place to live for when he is ready, but it's looking like it will take a while before he's settled into permanent housing and most of the temporary ""in-between"" prospects we have found (rented rooms, month-by-month studios and the like) will not allow him to take his two dogs with him.  

Ideally in either Anne Arundel or Baltimore county, does anyone know of temporary care or ""take-in"" sitting services for pets?  Or even themselves would be able to offer?  The dogs don't need any special care and they already have all the supplies they need, including kennels.

Any help would be appreciated.  Also if anyone can suggest a more appropriate subreddit so this post can find more eyes it would be really helpful.  Thank you!

**[EDIT]**
Some information about the dogs: One is a male Boston Terrier, a little over one year old; neutered, housebroken and well-trained in basic commands and leash.  The other is a male Pug/Boston Terrier mix, about 3 months old; too young to be neutered but it is planned, working on housebreaking and starting to grasp basic commands but no leash training yet.  They are both very affectionate and good with people and they get along wonderfully together and with other pets (small pets like rodents may not be good because Bostons are instinctive ratters).  They tend to play hard and have a bit of a ""don't know their own strength"" roughness, so perhaps care with small children should be considered, but older kids would be great.  The Boston is willful and a bit an attention-hog but that's nothing abnormal for the breed and he isn't aggressive or territorial.  I understand the complications of the mix being unhousebroken at this point, but so far he has learned basic commands really well so anyone who's trained dogs before should have no problem.  Neither have any health issues or special dietary needs.

**[ANOTHER EDIT]**
Also, this could probably be called a ""long-term"" arrangement.  We aren't 100% sure of when he'd be able to get settled into a new place, but at this point we're looking at sometime in the summer.  So it could be a couple months.",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,1365366354.0,,,True,t3_1buu08,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/1buu08/looking_for_temporary_care_for_a_friends_dogs/,

The problem is most of my lady friends are married or have kids or jobs that take up their whole lives -- so I'm left with no one to do fun stuff with.

He understands that I am incredibly independent and get antsy if I don't have fun activities to do, so he doesn't mind if I hang out with other people pretty often. I don't mind doing things alone, but it makes him nervous and he'd rather I had company on my random adventures. And he's not too comfortable with my hanging out with gentlemen on my own (totally understandable). Are there any ladies out there like me who'd be interested in hanging out a few times and being fun!??? I'm tired of missing out on all the good stuff because I have no one to accompany me.

We often remark about cookie-cutter responses, but what concerns me most about this response is that it is not entirely clear or on a strong stance at all.

&gt;Dear [REDACTED], Thank you for writing to me about copyright law. It's good to hear from you.

&gt;The PROTECT IP Act (S. 968) would give the Department of Justice (DoJ) authority to identify and take legal action against websites that market counterfeit or pirated goods.

&gt;I understand your concerns about this bill. Copyright laws are supposed to protect the creative property of artists, and it is important that these laws be followed. However, I agree that any efforts to strengthen the protection of copyrighted materials must be well planned, avoid unintended consequences, and must not stifle free speech or innovation.

&gt;S. 968 has been passed out of the Judiciary Committee and is awaiting action by the full Senate. Knowing of your views is helpful to me, and I will keep them in mind as Congress continues to debate this issue.

&gt;Thanks once again for writing. Please let me know if I can be of assistance in the future.

&gt;Sincerely, Barbara A. Mikulski United States Senator

This response was very terse compared to some others I have read. Hopefully, my continued writing and e-mailing will get more serious responses in the future. I am looking in to phone calling as well, but I am uncertain as to the benefits. Does anyone recommend an alternative?

i want to study multi-media and possibly work in movies or television. That school has caught my eye since the first time i laid eyes on it.

Moving to Maryland would mean leaving my family, my amazing girlfriend of 5 years (unless she decides to join me), and well, pretty much every single person that i know.

My sister-in-law is turning 21 tomorrow.  She will not have time to get the new and improved ""over 21"" license.  There have been talks about her not being allowed to purchase any drinks from bars/restaurants/store/etc with her under 21 ID.    Is this true?   Can an establishment bar you from purchasing alcohol when you are 21+, with a NON-EXPIRED license?   Are there any laws dealing with this?

It sounds highly stupid to not allow someone that is 21 to purchase something, that has a legal ID, just because it's not updated to the new version?   It is still a legal ID for everything else.

Thoughts, advice, etc?

ps: I did not have to deal with this when i turned 21.  I was in PA, and my licence still had a few years left before it expired.  I was never denied alcohol (barring the stupid 26hr rule at PSU Main at the time) while my ID still said ""not 21 until mm/dd/yyyy""

Not sure if correct place to post this, but I figured I'd take a shot.

I have 3 tickets to sell for Hershey Park on 4/20/13 (saturday).
I had some friends cancel and haven't been able to find anyone to take them off me.  

It's for what's called "" XX company appreciation day,"" meaning the park is closed to the public so lines will be extra short as it's only open to people within the company and their family/friends.  

I bought the tickets at $24 per and am selling them at $20 per or all 3 for $50.  

Please PM me if you are interested.  I am located in AA county if that helps.

SYNPOSIS:         
From acclaimed filmmakers Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer and Andy Wachowski comes the powerful and inspiring epic CLOUD ATLAS, based on the best-selling novel by David Mitchell. 
 
Drama, mystery, action and enduring love thread through a single story that unfolds in multiple timelines over the span of 500 years.  Characters meet and reunite from one life to the next.  Born and reborn.
 
As the consequences of their actions and choices impact one another through the past, the present and the distant future, one soul is shaped from a killer into a hero, and a single act of kindness ripples across centuries to inspire a revolution.
 
Everything is connected.
 
Academy Award® winners Tom Hanks (PHILADELPHIA, FORREST GUMP) and Halle Berry (MONSTERS BALL) lead a stellar international cast that also includes Oscar® winner Jim Broadbent (IRIS), Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Whishaw, James D'Arcy, Xun Zhou, Keith David and David Gyasi, with Oscar® winner Susan Sarandon (DEAD MAN WALKING) and Hugh Grant.  Each member of the ensemble appears in multiple roles as the story moves through time.
 
The film is written for the screen and directed by Lana Wachowski, Tom Tykwer and Andy Wachowski. The Wachowskis previously teamed as writers/directors of the groundbreaking MATRIX trilogy; Tom Tykwer won an Independent Spirit Award and earned a BAFTA Award nomination as the director/writer of RUN LOLA RUN, and more recently directed the award-winning thriller PERFUME: THE STORY OF A MURDERER.

Started off with a walk around show, with dozens of military vehicles on display that you could get in and look around. Afterwards was the parade and live fire demonstration, in which individual vehicles were paraded in front of the audience and their firepower demonstrated on targets. After the parade, all seven vehicles (which included an M1A2 tank and a Stryker armed with a 105mm cannon) lined up next to each other and unloaded all they could in one minute. It was utterly amazing, and nothing like it has been done there for a good 20 years. Some videos that popped up on Youtube:

[1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOR5X8Z2CDI)

[2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc1Hbpll6vA)

[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuZNrM-LEg0)

[4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHmG8adFcfA)

The videos unfortunately cannot do the 105mm and 120mm cannons justice. When those things went off (especially so for the 120mm), not only did the BOOM drown out everything, but the shock wave they let off every time was immense. Both were firing at a target 1900m (~1.2 miles) away, and neither missed once. The M1A2 tank features a smooth bore 120mm cannon that is accurate up to **5 miles**.

Anyway, just thought I'd share this with you. My brother was commanding in the Stryker, which is why I got a ticket to the show.

""If you're getting this email, you've either written to me or signed-up
 on my site to be notified when I'll be in your area. Well, I'm coming
 to Baltimore to include it in my new dancing video. This is an
 invitation to come out and join me.

 In this new video, I'm actually learning how to dance, so I'll be
 showing some easy moves and asking people to follow along. But don't
 worry. I'm still not very good at dancing so you don't have to be
 perfect either. Just remember to smile and have fun.

Dancing Event Info:

 PLACE: Next to the Pagoda in Patterson Park
 DATE: Tuesday, July 26th
 TIME: 6:30pm

 Here's a Google map of the location:
http://tinyurl.com/3kgn7wk

 The photo at the bottom of this email shows exactly where to meet. You
 can also view the image here:
http://imgur.com/zqH7O

Facebook:
 If you want to pass this around to friends, there is a Facebook event
 page with all the information included in this email. You can view it
 here:
http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=175149262552132

Meet-up Info:
 When you get to the spot, look for the guy who looks like the guy in
 the dancing video. Just come on over, say hello, and ask if I am Matt.
 If I'm not Matt, I will let you know.

 Before we dance, I will need to get your legal permission to appear in
 the video. I'll shout some legal-sounding stuff on camera and you can
 just nod and give me a thumbs up if you're okay with it. Kids under
 18, please bring a parent or guardian, or at least bring a photo of
 one of their thumbs to hold up (just kidding, don't do that)

 I can't guarantee the clip we shoot will end up in the final video.
 There will be a lot of footage to choose from and some of it will not
 be used.

 Wearing distinctive clothing will make it easier to spot yourself in
 the video, but please do not dress as a licensed character (Mario,
 Spider-Man, Sarah Palin) or I will have to blur you and that will make
 everyone think you showed up naked or something. Also, please do not
 show up naked.

 After the event, I'll be selling shirts and books. The T-shirt says ""I Danced
 With Matt"" (so you'll have proof) and the book is about the travels
 that went into making the previous ""Where the Hell is Matt?"" videos.
 Everything is $15. Cash only, please. You can also view and order both
 items here:
http://store.wherethehellismatt.com/

 You're welcome to bring your own camera. After the shoot, I'll stick
 around for as long as anyone is waiting. I'm happy to dance with you
 in your own picture/video, so don't hesitate to ask, but I do request
 that you wait until we're finished shooting because I'll be very busy
 until then.

 If you can, please click ""I'm Attending"" on Facebook if you plan to
 attend, so we have a rough
 idea of how many dancers to expect. If you're not on Facebook, don't
 worry about it. You're not missing anything.

 We're planning to put the final video up on the Internet before the end of 2011.

 I know a lot of you are nowhere near Baltimore. I can only put together
 so many of these events, so I pick the cities where I've received the
 most emails and I try to invite people to the event that's closest to
 them. D.C. was in the last video, so I'd like to include a different
 city this time. I hope you can make it up.

 I will also be dancing in Philadelphia and Raleigh, so if you'd prefer
 to go to one of those events, let us know and we'll send you the invite.

Want Matt to Come Dance With Your Group?
 I'm trying to include all sorts of dances with all kinds of groups
 this time, so if you or someone you know is part of a dance group that
 is willing to meet up and perform with me, please reply to this email
 and I'll see if I can fit it into the schedule. I may not be able to
 set something up on this visit,
 but if it's a really great opportunity I may try to get in touch with
 you later on.

 Please understand, though: this a pretty big planet we live on, and my
 schedule won't allow me to meet up with
 everyone, as much as I'd like it to, so I won't be able to respond to
 every idea.

 Okay, that's everything.

 I look forward to dancing badly with you!

 -Matt""

From the **Declaration of Rights** from the current **Constitution of Maryland** (below emphasis mine):
&gt; Art. 36. That as **it is the duty of every man to worship God in such manner as he thinks most acceptable to Him**, all persons are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty; wherefore, no person ought by any law to be molested in his person or estate, on account of his religious persuasion, or profession, or for his religious practice, unless, under the color of religion, he shall disturb the good order, peace or safety of the State, or shall infringe the laws of morality, or injure others in their natural, civil or religious rights; nor ought any person to be compelled to frequent, or maintain, or contribute, unless on contract, to maintain, any place of worship, or any ministry; nor shall any person, otherwise competent, be deemed incompetent as a witness, or juror, on account of his religious belief; **provided, he believes in the existence of God, and that under His dispensation such person will be held morally accountable for his acts, and be rewarded or punished therefor either in this world or in the world to come**.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing shall prohibit or require the making reference to belief in, reliance upon, or invoking the aid of God or a Supreme Being in any governmental or public document, proceeding, activity, ceremony, school, institution, or place.
&gt; 
&gt; Nothing in this article shall constitute an establishment of religion.
&gt; 
&gt; Art. 37. That no religious test ought ever to be required as a qualification for any office of profit or trust in this State, **other than a declaration of belief in the existence of God**; nor shall the Legislature prescribe any other oath of office than the oath prescribed by this Constitution.
   . . .
&gt; Art. 39. That the manner of administering an oath or affirmation to any person, ought to be such as those of the religious persuasion, profession, or denomination, of which he is a member, **generally esteem the most effectual confirmation by the attestation of the Divine Being**.

Those are the three articles in their entirety (apart from a few notes annotating document history).

I summarize those highlighted sections thusly:

 * Every man is required to worship a single unique God.

 * You are free to believe in a God who judges, rewards, and punishes you however you may like.

 * If you do NOT believe in such a God, you may legally be physically molested, as can anything you own. You may be legally compelled to frequent, maintain, and contribute to a place of worship or ministry. You may also legally be denied representation by yourself in court. You may also legally be refused the ability to serve as a juror.

 * Every person who will ever be involved in the creation, modification, and administration of the laws of the state of Maryland shall believe in a single unique and supreme God.

I am not a lawyer, but this is not OK.

**If you are a citizen of Maryland** and you think that this kind of discrimination is wrong, I urge you to visit [this page](http://mdelect.net/) and find the state delegates for your district. Call or write to them and tell them that it is unacceptable and that you demand equal rights for these minorities. You may also wish to call or write to Governor Martin J. O'Malley and Lt. Governor Anthony G. Brown whose contact information is also available from that page.",,False,self,t5_2qnnv,False,,,True,t3_19bxlw,http://www.reddit.com/r/maryland/comments/19bxlw/maryland_discriminates_against_atheists_and/,

http://imgur.com/Ekk5Q

Tobey's owner came upon hard times and lost her job and her home. She tearfully signed Tobey over to rescue, knowing that he'd have a much better life. 

In Tobey's previous home, he lived many of his days alone in the back yard. Despite the fact that he'd taken no Heartguard pills, he managed to stay heartworm-free. Lucky boy! He's been fully vetted now, which includes all his shots, neutering, and a dental cleaning. Next up, a full grooming to get him all sparkling white again!

Tobey is a true lap dog. He wants nothing more than to snooze in your lap or snuggle up by your side. He loves giving kisses and being carried around like a little prince. In his foster home, he lives with a female Cocker Spaniel and two cats and gets along well with them. He's a ladies' man, but warms up to men after he's had time to check them out.

Due to his previous living situation, Tobey is having to re-learn housetraining. He wears an absorbent belly band in the house to catch any accidents, but is getting better every day at holding it until it's time to go in the backyard. He's also taking some basic obedience training and is eager to learn new things, especially when they earn him more attention!

An ideal home for Tobey would be one with someone who loves to snuggle. Continuing with his training will help build your bond. We have a feeling that this adorable fluffball will be a cherished companion for many, many years to come. Reply here or send me a private message if you'd like to learn more about him or arrange a meetup. :-)

It's my first time voting in the state.

According to [voter lookup](https://voterservices.elections.state.md.us/VoterSearch), I am registered to vote and do not have to show ID when I vote (and nothing about provisional or ""pending"" status). They also sent me a piece of mail with my name on it with the sample ballot/voting location/etc. (The only thing is that the website previously claimed my ballot was incomplete. I called the county board of elections, and they clarified that they were verifying my SSN or something...and they did take care of it within a couple of days.)

However, when I went to my designated voting location today, I was told that I had to cast a provisional ballot...which was a bit of a surprise. So I casted my provisional ballot, showed ID, and left. The poll workers said that it was something about me not having shown my ID when I registered to vote. I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people who register to vote online or by mail (as was my case)...do a large proportion of MD voters register in person? Or is it just normal to have to cast a provisional ballot the first time you vote? 

Has anyone else experienced this before? Is there a good likelihood that my ballot could be rejected?

Is it an affordable area to live? Is there much to do for someone my age? Is the traffic terrible?

She was rear ended at ~45mph at the [intersection of Rolling Road and Security Blvd in Woodlawn MD](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=ROLLING+RD+%26+SECURITY+BLVD+sb,+Woodlawn,+Baltimore,+Maryland+21244&amp;aq=&amp;sll=39.31933,-76.921133&amp;sspn=0.013612,0.033023&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;geocode=FUHfVwIdu85s-w&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=ROLLING+RD+%26+SECURITY+BLVD+sb&amp;ll=39.313095,-76.755031&amp;spn=0.000851,0.002064&amp;t=h&amp;z=20).

*Older Black Male

*Dark Blue Minivan with Damaged Front

*Rolling rd &amp; Security Blvd

*Woodlawn MD


If anybody has **any** info please post in this thread or message me. The part that angers me the most is, when she was hit, she yelled ""you hit me"" and he apparently yelled back ""I know."" and drove off.

1)
Housing - anyone have any recommendations on cities to potentially live in?  (And even better - specific apartment complexes?)  I prefer places with low crime and fast internet (with rent around $1500 a month).

2)
Internet - Broadband / DSL providers in the area? I notice there seems to be Verizon FiOS in many places.  Is it worth it?


3)
Traffic - Google shows 5 and 6 lane roads for many of the major freeways to Baltimore, Annapolis or D.C (which I assume I will have to commute to for events / social stuff).  Is it bad enough that I should seriously consider public transportation on a regular basis or can it be avoided by simply driving off hours (not during rush hour)?

(I know, his mistake for leaving equipment in the car). They took his two guitars but left his $2,300 amp and pedal board. So I don't think they are very smart.


Location: Elkridge, Maryland

About the guitars:

1. White Ibanez Iceman, s/n 13020746, brand new condition.

2. Blue Ibanez Talman TM71 Semi-Hollowbody, don't have the s/n, custom P90 pickup in the Bridge

[Picture of the guitars](http://i.imgur.com/9HlAJnG.jpg)

Might be in a double gig case.

My friend immediately called the cops, who tried to take fingerprints. He called the local Guitar Centers. And has a friend who works at a pawn shop, who already let all of the other local pawn shops know. We're watching Craigslist too. Please keep an eye out!
