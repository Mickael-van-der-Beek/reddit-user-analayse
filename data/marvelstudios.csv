1372273546.0,74,self.marvelstudios,1h4kf5,My thoughts on the villains of Avengers 2 &amp; 3,AlibiBreakfast,87,13,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1h4kf5/my_thoughts_on_the_villains_of_avengers_2_3/,"When Joss Whedon was asked how he would approach Avengers 2, he [responded](http://screenrant.com/avengers-2-story-joss-whedon-kofi-158346/) with “By not trying to go bigger. By being smaller. More personal, more painful."" This leads me to believe that it has to do with villains from their past films. Let's take a look at who that might include:

During a recent twitter Q&amp;A, Kevin Feige was asked ""Will we see Extremis again after IM3?"" and his [response](http://www.slashfilm.com/kevin-feige-answers-iron-man-3-burning-questions-teases-marvel-cinematic-universe-links/) was ""Yes."" Keep in mind that we never see Killian's body at the end of IM3 (or Savin's, either). As for Thor, maybe Malekith lives or perhaps the Enchantress is cameoed in TDW.

During a radio [interview](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/MarvelFreshman/news/?a=69509), the host asked Frank Grillo if he was ""making more Crossbones appearances after Captain America: The Winter Soldier, to which Frank modestly confirmed. “Yeah, it's a good run,” Frank Grillo said."" Maybe Robert Redford's character in CA: TWS will actually be Baron Zemo or maybe Thanos rescues the Red Skull from the dimension he was sent to in exchange for his help.

In the Marvel one-shot [The Consultant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk8r1uZ7Liw), Agents Coulson and Sitwell discuss the fact that the Abomination survived and is in SHIELD custody and that the World Security Council wanted him released in order to join the Avengers Initiative. So we know Blonsky is alive and there is a [rumor](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/TheDailySuperHero/news/?a=82213) that SHIELD's actual HQ, Triskelion, will be featured in CA 2 and this base is the location of a super-villain prison in the Ultimate comic universe.

I'm guessing that Thanos' back story is fleshed out a little in Guardians of the Galaxy (who he likely defeats and/or kills to heighten the stakes and highlight how dangerous he is) then he rounds up these villains to take on the Avengers, similiar to his approach using Loki but with his idea being that this time, these villains know all our heroes weaknesses. They would, of course, be defeated and this would make Thanos the puppet master of the trilogy and set the stage for the final showdown in Avengers 3 after he presumably acquires either the Infinity Gauntlet (which would just make him too powerful) or the Tessaract (which could make a bookend on the trilogy). When Whedon was recently asked about Thanos, his [response](http://screenrant.com/the-avengers-3-thanos-joss-whedon/) was “Thanos is more powerful. He’s not someone you just trot out and punch him. Like you did in the comics, you want him to be threading through the universe and to save the big finale for the big finale.""",,False,self,t5_2uii8,False,,captainamerica2,True,t3_1h4kf5,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1h4kf5/my_thoughts_on_the_villains_of_avengers_2_3/,

Here is the first edition of something new that we are starting called ‘what we know so far’. In here, we are going to recap everything we know about Thor: The Dark World, including plot, characters, trailers, and speculations. Warning, this post may contain spoilers. So let’s start!

**Thor: The Dark World**

**Plot:** 

Marvel’s “Thor: The Dark World” continues the big-screen adventures of Thor, the Mighty Avenger, as he battles to save Earth and all the Nine Realms from a shadowy enemy that predates the universe itself. In the aftermath of Marvel’s “Thor” and “Marvel’s The Avengers,” Thor fights to restore order across the cosmos…but an ancient race led by the vengeful Malekith returns to plunge the universe back into darkness. Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet, one that will reunite him with Jane Foster and force him to sacrifice everything to save us all.

**Main Characters Info:**

* [Thor Odinson](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/1761902-thor_mighty_hammer.jpg) 

Thor, the Asgardian God of Thunder, is the son of Odin - All-Father of Asgard - and Gaea - the Elder Earth-Goddess - who, combining the power of these two worlds, is one of the greatest defenders of both . Thor is the mightiest warrior of Asgard, a founding member of the Avengers and one of the most powerful beings on Earth.

* [Malekith](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/3/31666/917855-malekith.jpg)

Malekith the Accursed, ruler of the Dark Elves of Svartalfheim is a powerful practitioner of Dark Faerie Magic. Centuries ago Malekith proved himself to be an enemy of both the humans of Earth and the gods of Asgard. Malekith's greatest weapon was the Casket of Ancient Winters, which contained mystical forces that could reproduce the overwhelming frigidity of another of the Nine Worlds, Niffleheim, the realm of ice.

* [Loki Laufeyson](http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/8/83882/2266104-76749_60062_loki.jpg)

Loki is the Asgardian God of Mischief and Lies, the adopted son of Odin and the archenemy of his brother, Thor. His cosmic meddling led to the formation of the Avengers. Loki is the adopted son of the Frost Giant Named Laufey, He was the King of the Ice realm. Odin declared war and killed Laufey, when he saw Loki as a baby, He adopted him.

**News, Rumors &amp; Trivia:**

* A new trailer will be released August 7, 2013.
* Malekith isn’t alone, it is expected that Kurse will be a supporting him, along with the Dark Elves.
* Based on the first trailer, many fans are assuming that [Loki will be joining forces with Thor. But knowing the nature of Loki, don’t be shocked if he switches sides once again, to further his own evil ambitions. ](/spoiler)
* Though Tom Hiddleston reprises his role of Loki, the actor has stated that [he is not expected to be a central villain and is rather seen taking responsibility for his crimes in The Avengers. ](/spoiler)
* In the comics, Malekith is scarred on the right side of his face; in this film it's on the left side.
* As a nod to the comics, Malekith's armor has a star emblem in the center.
* /u/cultstatus mentioned that at the end of the trailer shown at comic con, [Loki cuts off Thor's hand.](/spoiler)

**Speculations:**

/u/kolyz: I believe that [Jane Foster will die in this movie, at the hands of Malekith. I don’t think that Malekith will be killed, he is definitely going to be defeated but will escape somehow. I think Asgard might be heavily damaged because of the battles..](/spoiler). Also, Im expecting some connection to guardians of the galaxy, maybe the post credits scene will show us a glimps of the guardians.

/u/kaijunexus: [Jane will end things with Thor (or maybe even die) due to how wildly different their two worlds are. Also, I actually think Malekith will be killed by Kurse in this film. That will serve as Kurse's redemption, who may then either flee or live in Asgard at the end. As for Loki, I'm thinking either imprisonment in Hel or he'll escape again...](/spoiler)

Let's speculate on Marvel studio's phase 3 and 4 movies.,foureyedinabox,41,6,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kfq0l/feige_has_plans_to_2021_lets_speculate_on_marvel/,"[I posted this on /r/Marvel before I discovered this specific sub and I'm curious what everyone thinks?]

I think its safe to assume at least one movie a year from 2017 to 2021 and probably two movies a year for at least one of those four years, I put that in 2020.

*Iron Man - 2008

*The Incredible Hulk - 2008

*Iron Man 2 - 2010

*Thor - 2011

*Captain America: The First Avenger - 2011

*Marvel's The Avengers - 2012

*Iron Man 3 - 2013

*Thor : The Dark World - 2013

*Captain America: The Winter Solider - Apr 2014

*Guardians of The Galaxy - Aug 2014

*Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron - May 2015

*Ant-Man - Nov 2015

*Unannounced - May 2016

*Unannounced - July 2016

*Unannounced - May 2017

*Assumed 2018 (The Avengers 3?)

*Assumed 2019

*Assumed 2020

*Assumed 2020

*Assumed 2021

That's at least eight movies coming in their current plan outline to 2021, we know that one of those eight is Marvel's Avengers 3, Downey Jr. already signed a contact for A2 &amp; 3 but not anymore Iron Man sequels so we won't see Iron Man 4 until at least 2018 or 2019.

Let's make some education guesses of nerdy speculation.

What will the next eight movies be?

What new characters will be introduced in their own solo films? (The heavily rumored Doctor Strange and Black Panther phase three films).

What new character will be introduced in as part of sequel films? (Black Window, Hawkeye, Falcon, Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch).

What comic story lines will be adapted into phase 3 and 4? (The Winter Solider, rumored Planet Hulk and World World Hulk adaptations).

When will Thanos appear as main protagonist? (The Avengers 3?)

Will Marvel re introduce characters that had previous films with other studios? (Daredevil, Blade, The Punisher)",,False,self,t5_2uii8,False,,,True,t3_1kfq0l,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1kfq0l/feige_has_plans_to_2021_lets_speculate_on_marvel/,

To this day I do not understand, as I consider it on level with Iron Man, if not better.  Before I continue, I must put this post into context; I have held this assertion since the release of the final film of the original four, I am currently drunk and thus more opinionated than usual, and I have recently rewatched Iron Man, Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Cap.

I know the fact that the earth scenes and characters stole a bit of the lime light is one argument, but I thought the balance worked quite well, with the humour in the town striking a good balance for the risky material.  
All of the characters were quite likable and more importantly well developed.  Earth or Asgard.
Good score... In fact, the reveal of Asgard with the main theme playing is significantly memorable. ""Realm eternal.""
Good effects and overall design of characters and Asgard... The rainbow bridge/bifrost is dead on fucking perfect.
Incredible cast.
Nor do I find that it lags in certain areas as others seem to think.

Thank you for listening and please discuss.  I would like to hear you lot's thoughs... Both in agreement and to the contrary!

Obviously, though, Bucky is the Winter Soldier. The audience is meant to know this while Captain America doesn't.


Has anything been confirmed, however, that events from The First Avenger affected Barnes' psyche? I'm rewatching CA:TFA and I notice Bucky seems a little hostile towards everyone after being captured and tortured. 

Barnes shows jealousy towards Steve when Carter isn't interested in him, but rather Steve. He tries doing things on his own [which leads to him falling into the frozen river below](/spoiler)

If you don't believe that last part, watch the film again. [Notice how he picks up the shield and essentially tries to be Captain America but fails because he is not a super soldier who can handle vibranium.](/spoiler)

1372528940.0,27,self.marvelstudios,1hbjpy,What theme do you think will prevalent through Phase 2?,jecmoore,29,2,34,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1hbjpy/what_theme_do_you_think_will_prevalent_through/,"**SPOILERS**

In Phase 1, a prevalent theme seen throughout all of the films was inner turmoil. In Iron Man, Tony Stark was struggling with the image he has given the world and what his  legacy to the world would be (thank you Yinsen for making that perfectly clear). In Iron Man 2, Tony Stark is literally dying. I doubt that has been a greater symbolic sign of inner turmoil than him literally dying because of forces inside his body. 

Thor had to deal with his ego and pride (a lot like Stark...except he found a way to deal with differently). Cap had to deal with adjusting to a new world (his movie didn't really focus on much turmoil inside, but instead focused on the outward turmoil, which is why I think TWS will have a lot of inner turmoil). Hawkeye had his entire identity rewritten...pretty obvious inner turmoil there, and Black Widow constantly talked about the ""red on her ledger""...pretty obvious inner turmoil. And then Banner...does this really need to be touched on? 

So, what type of forces do you think we will see prevalent through Phase 2? Iron Man 3 had a couple: [love interest being kidnapped and those you care about being attacked/outer turmoil/greatest weakness (fire over steel)] (/spoiler). But which do you think will be the big one seen in all films? Or do you think there will be one at all?

Tony built the reactor to keep the metal away from his heart and has been part of him since his capture in 2008 and has largely been part of his identity as Iron Man every since as it the power source to both his suit and his motivation. But true purpose was protect Tony and always be a magnet to attract something it will never see. The reactor and the shrapnel are forever connected by this.

1374722324.0,27,self.marvelstudios,1j05hs,To those guessing how Ultron will come about.,jecmoore,28,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j05hs/to_those_guessing_how_ultron_will_come_about/,"I have heard many speculate that Tony Stark **will** create Ultron in *Avengers: Age of Ultron*. 

I have probably already given it away, but I don't think Stark **will** create anything but another Iron Man suit in the next Avengers. 

But I do believe that Stark **did** create Ultron. 

Let me explain. There is one character in the MCU that received a HUGE makeover. J.A.R.V.I.S. For those who didn't know...[this is Edwin Jarvis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis#Film), the character that JARVIS was based on in the film. As you can see, he is a living, flesh and bone person. Not an advanced computer program. The reason for this change was never stated, but I have always assumed that it was to make it so that while Tony worked or was in the Iron Man suit, he wouldn't have sit in silence, and also gave a little more humor to the films.   

But now, I have different reason. JARVIS isn't like Siri. People who make this comparison annoy me so much. Siri has a large pre-recorded and texted messages she can give back to you, but we constantly see JARVIS formulate his own intellectual sentences and have real conversations with Tony. He is in fact an AI. In fact, we have even heard inflections in his voice suggesting that he does have emotions (he goes even so far to suggest that Tony call Pepper win he is headed into the wormhole as it is probable that he will die). 

Who is the only other person to be able to control an Iron Man suit in the films outside of Stark or Rhodie? JARVIS. 

Like in so many films, the AI realizes it no longer needs humans and seeks to destroy them.

To further the idea of machines vs humans, Happy mentions (subtly) to  Pepper in *Iron Man 3* that they should replace the janitors with robots that Tony developed. So yeah. 

In *Iron Man 3*, we also see JARVIS use the suit to save Tony while he trapped beneath his own house in the ocean. Remember? He tells him to take a deep breath, and then breaks the arm piece away and then the suit pulls him up from the ruble. Moreover, JARVIS flies the suit to Rose Hill, Tennessee to which Tony (who was passed out the entire flight and incapable of controlling the suit) claims ""Why? This was not my idea. JARVIS responds with ""I think I'm malfunctioning."" And then JARVIS shuts down with the suit. But no worry, JARVIS is seen alive and well later in the movie. 

TL;DR: JARVIS, the AI that Stark created, is Ultron.  ",,False,self,t5_2uii8,1374723973.0,,ironman2,True,t3_1j05hs,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1j05hs/to_those_guessing_how_ultron_will_come_about/,

I want to know what your preferred viewing order of the MCU films is!

Here's mine:

1. Iron Man

2. Iron Man 2

 2.1. Marvel One-Shot - A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Thor's Hammer

3. Thor

4. The Incredible Hulk

 4.1. Marvel One-Shot - The Consultant

5. Captain America - The First Avenger

6. The Avengers

 6.1. Marvel One-Shot - Item 47

And Iron Man 3, Agents of SHIELD, and the other films that haven't been released after that, but no particular order yet because I haven't seen them.

I chose this order because the first 2 Iron Man films go first, one after the other, then at the end of 2, Thor's hammer shows up. So you can watch the short about Coulson's trip there, then Thor. Then Incredible Hulk, and since Stark appears at the end, you watch The Consultant short after it (since IM2 established him as the consultant). Then, Captain America because it seems as though Fury has already assembled the team at the end and the rest of the film seems like a flashback. Then Avengers and then Item 47 since it's right afterward and a bit of an epilogue.

So how about you guys? What order do you watch in, and why?",,False,self,t5_2uii8,False,,ironman,True,t3_1gd8fu,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1gd8fu/mcu_film_viewing_order_spoilers_about_older_mcu/,

http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/JoshWildingNewsAndReviews/news/?a=79944

The article says he could possibly be Donald Blake which would be a fun little cameo, but I would like to propose that he could be Hank Pym.
In the first Thor film Dr. Selvig mentioned he had a friend who had experiences with SHIELD and what not and it was later confirmed that it was intended to be Hank Pym. In an [interview with Kevin Feige](http://collider.com/kevin-feige-interview-thor-avengers-iron-man-3-ant-man-doctor-strange/) he says the only words they removed from the script for that scene were ""Hank Pym"". So, I propose that Jane could be on a ""date"" with Hank Pym discussing various science things set up by or including Dr. Selvig. While it's listed as a cameo in all the interviews there is no name for a character associated with him on the IMDB page for Thor TDW and he has never said who he is supposed to be. Marvel likes to keep things under wraps and I think it would be cool to introduce him early on like this. I could be grasping at air here but I can only hope!

Given the twist behind the Mandarin, where does the organization stand? They serve the needs of Stane in IM1, appear briefly in regard to Whiplash in IM2, and are worked into the Mandarin plot line of IM3. 

Their inclusion particularly in IM1 and IM3 work well to bring everything full circle. 

The way I look at it is they're either a fabrication created by Stane and Killian to serve their needs in destroying Stark and taking over the world or they're an actual organization who fell into this business with Killian and others. 

I'm looking at the first option (they're a fabrication).

As we near the releases of MCU film releases, marketing ramps up and we often see the release of many new trailers, tv-spots, clips, posters, and general marketing materials...many of which may include characters and plot developments in the film that some may not wish to know before seeing the movie.

It becomes difficult to define what classifies as a ""spoiler"", as everyone has a different idea of what that really is...

At the moment, Marvel is releasing images of new Iron Man armors.  They are everywhere, and I'd be surprised if anyone hasn't seen them yet.  Are these spoilers?  They would be for anyone who abstained from watching the trailers.  And yet, the images of these armors are plastered everywhere...

So how would we post them without spoiling anything?  We would have to title the post as something like ""New Iron Man 3 images"".  This would garner much less attention and would defeat the purpose of a title, which is to let people know what the post is about specifically.

So, /r/marvelstudios is going to classify any official marketing from Marvel Studios as NOT SPOILERS.  This includes trailers, posters, tv-spots, and any other marketing materials.  These are advertisements.

So what are going to be considered spoilers?  Any information which is not publicly released by Marvel Studios.  However, we are also going to consider film clips as potential spoilers since they are actual whole pieces of the film itself.  These will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis.

If there are any questions or concerns about this policy, please voice them in the comments.

Being an MCU fanatic rather than a comic reader myself, I didn't have a preconceived mindset of the Mandarin (besides the trailers) going into the film and I throughly loved the surprise. That being said, however, I'd like to share a comment I found that I thought was pretty interesting. By garrysmodmoviemaker1 of YouTube, he made the following comment that I think addresses a lot of what people might have overlooked. In case the comment disappears from top comment on YT, here it is:

&gt;Guy Pearce is as much of the Mandarin as Liam Neeson was Ra's al Ghul. That is, his backstory and more fantastic elements were changed, as well as his race, but the core is still there:
&gt;
&gt;-Genius scientist
&gt;
&gt;-Hates Iron Man
&gt;
&gt;-Shoots fire
&gt;
&gt;-Has super powers
&gt;
&gt;-Martial artist
&gt;
&gt;-Dragon tattoos
&gt;
&gt;-Fascination with ancient China
&gt;
&gt;-Petty, spiteful, mad.
&gt;
&gt;Et﻿ cetera. Imagine if the guy in the beard had been the Mandarin. It would've been disappointing because he had none of the above traits like the comics Mandarin.

So what do you guys think? General thoughts or anything that you hadn't realized before that makes sense now?

Just enter your background design/art by posting it in the comments section below by midnight on September 2, 2012 to be entered!

GramNapkin and I will look over the submissions and decide which will be the new background design!

A tip...try to keep it relatively subtle, since this will be in the background at all times on the subreddit.

I realize many Marvel fans know the characters, but honestly, the only exposure I have to them is a brief snippet in Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heros, and a few free ComiXology downloads. I'm of the belief that I'm a superhero movie fanboy, but does the general movie-going public even know the names of these characters, let alone their backstories? Are they going to introduce them independent of the Avengers sequel(s)? I could see them making a brief appearance in the Age of Ultron, but I suspect they might be more needed when battling Thanos, Drax specifically I suppose.

Though Rusty believes he and Mark are truly friends, Mark actually just uses the gullible and naive Rusty for his expertise in computer hacking and infiltration, which enables the two to rob high-security banks and institutions.

Mark has stepped on a lot of toes in pulling off these large jobs, however. Some of those toes are big. Mafia big. The Maggia crime family want him dead, but want it done discreetly and without getting their hands dirty. The Maggia blackmails Rusty into purposefully blowing one of he and Mark's jobs by threatening to kill a girl Rusty believes to be his girlfriend, but is truly hardly even an acquaintance. 

Rusty apprehensively sabotages the job in order to get Mark caught and thrown in jail so that the incarcerated ""little toes"" he has stepped on will take care of him for the Maggia. 

Mark, knowing Rusty betrayed him, breaks out of jail before anyone has a chance to try and take his life...but not before seeing a news broadcast about the incarceration of Justin Hammer and the liquidation of Hammer Industries. Mark has an idea.

Rusty is terrified to hear that Mark is on the loose and is soon even more horrified to see that he has broken into his apartment and is standing in front of him. Mark, however, has no intention of killing Rusty yet. He explains that all is forgiven and he wants to pull off another job with Rusty.

Arriving at a Hammer Industries warehouse, Rusty breaks into the security system and the two enter the large building to find hundreds of large, high-tech storage crates. Rusty begins opening them one-by-one as Mark examines the contents. He is elated to find all manner of high-tech weaponry and is about to use some to slaughter Rusty when he hears his partner exclaim ""my god!"". 

Curious, Mark moves over to the crate that Rusty has opened only to find a proto-type Whiplash suit much like the one Vanko wore at the Monaco racetrack, but more heavily armored. Mark tinkers with it for a moment only to find that it is fully operational. He gleefully dons the suit and cuts off an end of one of the still-locked containers, spilling weapons onto the floor.

Laughing, Rusty muses ""I guess you don't need me to break into stuff anymore!""

""Guess not"" says Mark, quite simply...as he cuts Rusty in half.",,False,self,t5_2uii8,False,,thor,True,t3_1c2jxj,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1c2jxj/my_idea_for_how_to_use_whiplash_again_in_the_mcu/,
1361337278.0,13,self.marvelstudios,18vbpn,Theory on How Shared Universe Would Work...,AppleTStudio,19,6,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/18vbpn/theory_on_how_shared_universe_would_work/,"So [as of recent rumors](http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/02/17/planet-hulk-movie-could-those-rumors-confirm-a-unified-marvel-movieverse/) regarding the possibility of every Marvel film coexisting in a multi-studio universe, I began thinking of a theory of how that all could work.

The answer lies with X-Men: Days of Future Past. 

For those unfamiliar with DoFP, the story involves the X-Men traveling through time. A lot. And what happens when we travel through time? Timelines are ruined, split or changed.

As of right now, there are 4, yes, 4, different universes with different timelines. They are as followed:

•	Avengers Timeline

•	X-Men: Origins through The Last Stand

•	X-Men: First Class

•	The Amazing Spider-Man



Now, as of right now no mentions of any characters or organizations have been made that would contradict any timeline. However, it is pretty obvious that OSCORP does not exist in, say, The Avengers universe alongside of Stark Industries.

Mark Millar has said recently that he wants to create a shared universe for X-Men and Fantastic Four (being rebooted very soon) that does not contradict The Avengers universe. This sudden change cannot just happen out of nowhere. There is also the problem of unifying the two X-Men universes. 

I believe an Event will happen in Days of Future Past that will allow the unity of both X-Men universes to occur, as well as have some burn off effects, such as the Fantastic Four forming.

Even more so, I believe this Event will unify ALL Marvel universes, all across different studios.

The best part about all of this is that, after The Event, no character will question why suddenly OSCORP Tower is in New York with Stark Tower (for those unaware, the OSCORP Tower plans were given to Disney by Sony, but was not incorporated into The Avengers due to time restraints).

Because changes that occur from time travel are seamless, all characters across studios will be able to coexist in the same universe.


Now, there is still the whole “legal usage of characters” thing. The best part about being in a shared universe is that a character does not have to directly appear in order to make them canon within the universe.

Think of Quentin Tarantino and how all of his films are tied together. Remember Red Apple cigarettes? They can be found in every movie that is connected to one of Quentin Tarantino’s universes.

Essentially, all anyone would need is to see OSCORP on a truck, an ad for “Gifted Students,” or something along those lines.

All right, I’m ready for people to start picking apart this theory. It’s just a theory I came up with and I’m excited to discuss it with people and get everyone’s input, so please let me know what you think!

On April 18th, Iron Man 3 will be officially released in New Zealand.  On this day, we will create an official ""Iron Man 3 Review Post"".  If you want to post a review of the Iron Man 3 film, you may do so in the comments section of this thread.  ANY SINGLE POSTS CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVIEWING IRON MAN 3 WILL BE REMOVED.

Posts pertaining to discussion of the film in any aspect other than posting a ""film review"" of the movie will be allowed as usual.

This policy will also be in effect for any future film releases unless otherwise noted.

If the official review thread is significantly buried by the time Iron Man 3 is released in the UK or US, we may create official UK or US review posts to compensate.

The purpose of having dedicated posts where reviews may be posted in the comments is to eliminate excessive post clutter in the subreddit.

We will be more lenient about film review posts several weeks after a films release.

Currently, no Marvel comic features Peter Parker as Spider-man.  It's either Miles Morales as Ultimate Spider-man or Doctor Octopus as Superior Spider-man.

That said, does Marvel's deal with Sony only deal with the ""classic"" Spider-man with Peter Parker?

Hammer would be difficult because Norman Osborn is not in the MCU to bring them back after the events in IM2.  Yeah they could change the story but it just doesn't seem likely.

I believe that in future movies we will see a combination of AIM and Hydra.  Maybe hopefully see Baron Zemo or Madame Hydra and if it could be pulled off visually see MODOK.  For the cosmic side I see either the Kree or Skrulls.

Surely the return of Extremis will be Iron Man's Extremis armor but what if it could be used to bring the Red Hulk to the MCU? AIM assisted in the creation of the Red Hulk in the comics and the organization was introduced in Iron Man 3. What if Ross undergoes a similar procedure like Blonsky but injects himself with Extremis as an alternative? Ross kills Abomination like he does in the comics but in the MCU for his arrogance in TIH.

&gt;FIGHT CLUB!

&gt;Each week we'll pit two MCU characters in a pugilistic brawl until only one man (or woman... or chitauri) is left standing!  Remember, base all of your decisions off the movies, not the comics or any other source!

PREVIOUS WINNERS

**IV War Machine vs Destroyer....**            Destroyer


**III Thor vs Hulk...**                               Hulk


**II Odin vs Shield...**                              Odin


**I Captain America vs Black Widow...**       Captain America


This week the world's darkest, greenest baddie the ABOMINATION will battle the God of mischief, Loki

Note: This battle takes place on earth, with no outside influence.  Loki is in possession of his AVENGERS era sceptre, but not the tesseract directly.  The Abomination is at the same level of strength and intellect as in THE INCREDIBLE HULK


**KNOWN FEATS AND ABILITIES**

Loki:

* Through strategy, had Thor banished to Earth

* King of Asgard for a time, commander of The Destroyer.

* Killed Laufi

* Infiltrated SHIELD unnoticed in THOR and Infiltrated SHIELD and nearly destroyed THE AVENGERS in the movie of the same name

* Killed Coulson

* Has Asgardian super strength and durability, but not nearly on the same level of his brother or father (even though he is Jotun by birth)

* Master of magick and trickery

ABOMINATION

* Strength comparable to Hulk's initial stages (not sure how this reflects against BATTLE FOR NEW YORK Hulk)

* Defeated Thunderbolt Ross's military force

* Appears to have retained a great deal of Emil Blonsky's intellect

* The most perfected super soldier since Captain America


*****************************
Alright, now just voice your opinion in the comments below, and we'll tally up the results.

The contest will be open for 7 days, and the winner will be announced at the start of next week's FIGHT CLUB

Obviously Clark Gregg's been hinting that Life Model Decoys may be involved in his appearance in the S.H.I.E.L.D. series, and I guess everyone's asking which is going to be the LMD: the film Coulson or the TV Coulson.

But what if they both are? What if there was never a Coulson. If you wanted to craft an agent, could you do any better? Faceless, affable, ubiquitous, deadly. Coulsons could be anywhere you need them to be.

Firstly Robert Downey Jr. is out of contract after IM3 (correct me if I'm wrong) so unless Marvel and RDJ thrash something out quickly there wouldn't be time to rewrite a whole script to remove Iron Man from the Guardians of the Galaxy film if no deal was made. Would Marvel have a back-up storyline prepped? Or maybe that is why we are seeing MCU elements introduced into Nova comics (as a potential replacement character)?

For me, it's in the NYC battle...The scene from where Cap boosts Widow up to the Chitauri speeder thing.. and everything that follows.   

Particularly when Iron Man comes swooping by to help Widow, then continues on, landing to perform a blast deflected off of Cap's shield, then up to the roof to help Hawkeye fend off his perch and then smashing Chitauri troops into the Leviathan that Hulk then stabs with debris and Thor hammers it (with lightning) home, crashing it down for Hulk to comically punch Thor off the screen.    

The pure epicness of that sequence, and all that it truly symbolized for this wider Marvel Cinematic Universe... seeing the heroes play off each other's strengths, and set each other up for moves... It might be my favorite action bit of the whole movie. 

I've tried googling, but can't find a clip of it (understandably) but figured someone might have seen it posted somewhere.   

What scenes made you sit back and think ""This movie is awesome... This universe is going to be epic... and I've been waiting for exactly this since I was a kid""?

--------
___________

Personally, I would remove Ant-Man (I like the character, but feel like he could easily be introduced in Avengers 2), and would add a Moon Knight movie.

I've always had a certain affinity for Moon Knight.  He's a really fascinating character and I think a movie based on his comic would be something refreshingly darker and grittier in the MCU, where many films so far have been a bit lighter in tone.

* Defeated Loki

* Defeated a horde of Jotuns

* Capable of creating massive storms, tornados, and lightning strikes

* Can fly at supersonic speeds

* Seemed to have bested Iron Man before Captain America showed up in The Avengers



ABOMINATION

* Strength comparable to Hulk's initial stages (not sure how this reflects against BATTLE FOR NEW YORK Hulk)

* Defeated Thunderbolt Ross's military force

* Appears to have retained a great deal of Emil Blonsky's intellect

&gt;FIGHT CLUB!

&gt;Each week we'll pit two MCU characters in a pugilistic brawl until only one man (or woman... or chitauri) is left standing!  Remember, base all of your decisions off the movies, not the comics or any other source!

Last week's winner was ODIN, who viciously defeated the world's greatest espionage agency SHIELD

This week Asgard's favorite son, THOR, will battle The Strongest One There Is, HULK.

Note: This is a no holds barred battle.  Thor isn't reserving any strength or fighting ""down"" to a human level.  Hulk is completely unbridled, as we saw him in the final fight scene in the Avengers.


**KNOWN FEATS AND ABILITIES**

THOR:

* Wielder of Mjolnir, forged in the heart of a dying son, unrivaled as either a weapon or a tool to build... or something like that.

* Defeated the Destroyer, Asgard's protector of relics

* Defeated Loki

* Defeated a horde of Jotuns

* Capable of creating massive storms, tornados, and lightning strikes

* Can fly at supersonic speeds

* Seemed to have bested Iron Man before Captain America showed up in The Avengers

HULK

* Capable of shredding armored military vehicles to tethers (TIH)

* Becomes stronger the longer he fights (with anger and everything)

* Killed a Leviathan with a single punch

* Defeated the Abomination, who is a Top Tier threat and one of the strongest beings in the MCU

* Surprisingly quick for such a large, strong being, as seen in THE AVENGERS immediately after Cap gives the order ""Hulk... Smash.""

* Capable of withstanding direct hits from dozens of Tesseract powered weapons

* Appeared to have Thor on the down and out before a Jet distracted him

* Withstood multiple strikes from Mjolnir

Having read Extremis but not a lot in the way of Iron Man outside of the general event books, im curious as to Mandarin fits into the whole equation. I could see them replacing Mallen with Mandarin if they plan to stay true to Extremis, since something will need to happen to force Tony to undergo the procedure. The leaked trailer synopsis from earlier today mentions that he is undergoing surgery, maybe he's finally getting that shrapnel removed from his chest (as mentioned in Extremis).

Probably my most favorite thing about life. Just wondering how you guys would like to see the order of the movies released.

Personally I would like to see them done in this order

What we have seen so far:

Iron man (2008)
Incredible Hulk (2008)

Iron man 2 (2010)

Thor (2011)
Captain America (2011)

Avengers (2012)

What I would like to see from this point on:
Iron man 3 (2013)
Thor 2 (2013)

Captain America 2 (2014)
Avengers 2: Phase 2 (2014)

Thor 3 (2015)
Captain America 3 (2015)

Avengers 3: Civil War part 1 (2016)
Avengers 3: Civil War part 2 (2017)

I also read awhile ago that Marvel was going to do bigger and better things with there Marvel One Shots. I heard they were going to do short films (10 mins) to introduce a character, Iron fist was first on the agenda. Haven't heard or read anything about that since. This would help a lot if they were going into the Civil War story arc. Also I hope Sony will make a deal to put spider-man into one of the movies.

What do you guys think?

&gt;FIGHT CLUB!

&gt;Each week we'll pit two MCU characters in a pugilistic brawl until only one man (or woman... or chitauri) is left standing!  Remember, base all of your decisions off the movies, not the comics or any other source!

Last week's winner was HULK, who beat THOR's face to a bloody pulp... probably.

This week the man in the gray suit WAR MACHINE will battle the guardian of the relic THE DESTROYER.

Note: This battle takes place on earth, where Rhodey isn't subjected to any bizarre environment effects.  And just like the movies, the Destroyer is unoccupied by a pilot.


**KNOWN FEATS AND ABILITIES**

WAR MACHINE:

* Without full weaponry, he defeated Iron Man in a close quarters battle (IM 2 party scene)

* Has the same weapons and functionality of an Iron Man Mark II suit

* Possess Hammer Tech weapons for modern warfare

* Defeated a horde of Hammer Drones alongside Iron Man

* An Air Force Colonel with combat experience (probably the most notable of his experience)

THE DESTROYER

* Protected Asgardian treasure from Jotuns

* Completely eviscerates Jotuns in a single blast

* Defeated the Warriors Three and Sif

* Defeated Coulson and his SHIELD Agents

* Powered by Asgardian technology, so its damaging effects on Iron Man armor are unkown (think back to Thor's lightning strike in THE AVENGERS)

So explanations

* S.H.E.I.L.D series would focus on the aftermath of the event of The Avengers, specifically trying to clear up the mess of NYC, the publics knowledge/outcry of superheroes and the sudden uprise of 'wannabee' heroes and villians. Nick Fury would appear in a few episodes, mainly the premiere and finale episodes but the majority of it will be handled by Maria Hill. Perhaps even cameos from Black Widow and Hawkeye....and obviously mentions of the Avengers, like keeping tabs on them. New agent on the job, Jessica Drew, learns to cope with daily life within SHIELD and the series is mainly seen from her POV, entering this hectic world and her journey to becoming Spider-Woman. Cameos from the likes of Falcon, Agent Sitwell, Carol Danvers and Jimmy Woo. Other minor villans spanning across the Marvel universe. This show would have minor crossovers with the other MCU shows.

I'm sure there's enough material for a second and maybe 3rd series but I ain't got enough knowledge

In the second series, Carol Danvers would become Ms Marvel somehow, Jessica Jones would become Spider-Woman and the likes of Iron Fist and Luke Cage would be seen.

* Hulk t.v series will show what Banner is doing after the Avengers. With the knowledge on how to control the Hulk, Banner is able to keep his emotions in check and travel around the poorer countries and help those in need. it's at this point Banner meets the young Rick Jones whom he takes on as a sidekick. However the likes of General Thunderbolt Ross (a.k.a the Red Hulk) and The Leader amongst other villains (such as Jackdaw, Juggernaut, Rhino and Ringmaster and a return of the Abomination). All actors/actresses from the Incredible Hulk movie should reprise their roles and Banner/Hulk is of course played by Ruffalo. In the S.H.I.E.L.D show, certain information would be seen on screens or even mentioned about Banner and his movements.

* Ant-Man
Origins of Ant-Man and Wasp, don't know about the story but perhaps the baddie is Egghead or....Whirlwind or something I dunno....during the movie they become SHIELD agents and once they defeat whoever it is, Fury decides to add them to the Avengers roster. 

* Daredevil series would be more detached from the other shows, but should still have an odd reference here and there to the rest of the MCU. The first series is generally his origin, showing his backstory in flashbacks and him and his conflict within Hells Kitchen. Kingpin will be the primary antagonist with the likes of Elektra,Bullseye, The Jester, Mister Fear and The Punisher (cameo in a 2 or 3 partner from his own series). Foggy Nelson will of course appear and even a cameo from Moon Knight as well. Ben Urich and the Daily Bugle will also appear, maybe a cameo from J.J.J. as well, not sure yet.


* The Amazing Spider-man 2
Yes, I'm bringing in the Amazing Spider-man series into the MCU because I don't want to leave him out of this wonderful story. Anyway basically ASM2 will stay within itself but just and odd eater egg to the rest of the MCU. The 3rd movie should have the death of Gwen Stacy and the Green Goblin. SHIELD would appear for a moment with Nick Fury as Peter, struggling with the death of Gwen, decides he needs help with stopping Osborn. Fury believes Peter can do it on his own. Peter can't join the Avengers until he's 18...or 21...Whichever.


* The Punisher series will be dark and gritty and gory, on par with the Walking Dead and be pretty contained and even further away from The Avengers side of the MCU however will feature easter eggs and crossovers with Daredevil, specifically with them fighting each other at some point and sharing an enemy or 2 (The Kingpin and Bullseye). I ain't got much to say but it's just showing The Punisher being him, his reasons for doing what he does and facing baddies, notably Jigsaw, Hitman, Elite, Payback, Finn Cooley and The Russian.

* For the third installments I'd just keep them on track with where the current one is going, I just added two crappy subtitles there featuring the possible villains (The Enchantress and Red Skull again)

* Black Panther movie would obviously show his origins, his country and everything like that and in the end Black Panther is seen talking the Henry Pym and Wasp over Vibranium and they extend an invitation to him to join the Avengers.

* Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I have no idea...maybe Kang the Conqueror or something....if anything I wouldn't have a sequel to them unless they made the 3rd Avengers another cosmic force to deal with instead of the Civil War route I've taken. 

* Dr Strange movie would show his origins and open up the magical part of the MCU and the villain would be Baron Mordo. Not really much I can say on this but I reckon near the end he'll decide to try either join the Avengers or then start his own group, thus creating the 'Marvel Knights' with Daredevil, Moon Knight and Shang-chi.

* Heroes for Hire would be either a short series maybe 6 hour long episodes which shows Luke Cage (Power Man), Iron Fist, White Tiger, She-Hulk (who could cameo in SHEILD, Daredevil or Hulk) and Namor. The First episode is them joining together and flashbacks to origins or bits of backstory with the story showing them working together to tackle problems to big for ordinary people but too small for the Avengers to get involved. A second series, if there was one, could add in Ghost Rider, Silver Sable and Paladin...

* 2019
Would have final sequel movies for the main 3 Avengers, Iron Man, Cap and Thor and each would end somehow leading into 2020 and the Avengers Civil War.

* Yea a 2 parter....kinda like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was divided. A huge catastrophe like in the comics kills hundreds of innocent people and children which is blamed on superpowered people and causes an uprising within the general public and begins the superhero registration act....well you know the comics. This will have cameos and appearances from almost every hero and villian who isn't dead who has been introduced in the MCU movies and shows. Yea....
yea I know, that's pretty much the bare minimum needed to encompass the entire 616 universe which probably isn't needed for the MCU but still I'd love it to be like that

But yea through those next 8 years if you also include the DC movies to come out, plus non MCU movies like X-Men and Fantastic 4 then yea there is way to much. 

Oh yes I know, I had Ultron typed up but wouldn't he need all the Avengers to be taken down, not just Ant-Man and Wasp? Thats why I didn't put him there as I wasn't sure really....but if I'm mistaken then by all means he'd be great to add.",,False,self,t5_2uii8,False,,thor,True,t3_10fxh5,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/10fxh5/how_id_like_to_see_the_mcu_go/,

Granted, it's generally agreed that the film is one of the weaker (if not the weakest) Marvel Cinematic Films released so far...but can it be said that it added nothing at all to the growing universe?

After all, Iron Man 2 saw the introduction of several new characters (War Machine, Black Widow, Justin Hammer, Whiplash) and expounded upon Tony's past as well as his father's.

However, some might say that the film never managed to truly develop any of its characters and added little to the MCU lore as a whole.

So, how do you feel about Iron Man 2 in regards to its place in the MCU?

1374601933.0,6,self.marvelstudios,1iwbjx,Doesn't it seem weird that Marvel would let Edgar Wright sit on Ant-Man for almost 10 years? They announced him as director at Comic-Con 2006.,ClintBartonHawkguy,9,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/1iwbjx/doesnt_it_seem_weird_that_marvel_would_let_edgar/,"Why let Ant-Man come out 10 years after being announced? They've demonstrated that they put a lot of importance in getting these movies out as quickly as possible. IIRC, Favreau said ""there's no way we can make Iron Man 2 this quickly"", but they went ahead and set the date anyway. Same thing with Thor 2 -- Marvel planned on making it before it talking with Kevin Branagh. Joss Whedon was reportedly hired for The Avengers and told he had two years until it was onscreen. 

We've all heard that Feige is strict in regards to how Marvel Studios is run -- think of the reported drama with Favreau, Rourke, Branagh, Jenkins, Howard, Hemsworth, Johansson, Norton, Jenkins, and now Taylor. So why let a planned, written, ready-to-be-filmed property sit for so long? (Even if its not the most profitable one in the world.)

EDIT: I should specify that I'm not criticizing Marvel, or Feige, for how they run things. I just think it's curious that they are giving Wright so much time to do this while being fairly strict with all their other properties.
