116 people participated.

25% of the people want separate subeddits.

75% want a single subreddit.

have a nice day!

(mild spoilers),tempranos,54,10,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/vzgbt/one_of_my_favorite_parts_of_the_reboot_mild/,"Web Shooters. When I first heard there would be web shooters I was like okay thats cool, just like in the comics, but I didn't think they would be as important in the movie as they were in the comics.
2 scenes where I thought they were super cool:

1. Under water, when they wouldn't work, that is awesome! Just like in the comics maybe in the next movie he can develop water proof webbing, like he did in the comics.

2. When the Lizard breaks his web shooters in the final battle I thought was awesome as well, compared to the Raimi films where he could use his webs any time, all the time. When the web shooters break it makes him a much more vulnerable hero. While they were breaking i felt like Peter's odds of defeating the lizard went down dramatically as he is now without one of his most important tools.

I know I seem to be nerdgasming about something seemingly insignificant to some, but I was really impressed with how much focus was put on the web shooters, and I'm sure there are several other Spidey fans who agree. Also how sweet was the new costume?

Any CSS change ?

Any other idea to be implemented in the sub, which is available in some others and not ours ?

Because of this and the fact that they both moved alot, I never really had any close friends for most of my child hood. And I can still clearly remember the one thing that pulled me through all this; comic books, but more specifically good ol' Peter Parker. I remember the first comic I ever owned, which ironically was the last I a Spider-Man mini series, and I remember trying to collect every single piece of spidey merchandise I could possibly get my hands on, so I guess the point is, is that when my life was at rough points, I found my only true escape in spider man, and honestly my first real friend, because it was so much easier to slip into that wonderful world of fiction, and to know that I wasn't alone in life struggles, so if like to say thank you to Stan lee, Steve ditko, and most of all, spider man :) (sorry for how ranty this was)",,False,self,t5_2rw42,False,,,True,t3_17c330,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/17c330/spiderman_not_just_a_hero_in_fiction_but_in_real/,

I read Spider-Man up until the end of JMS's run, and One More Day made me lose one more book from my pull, the web-head's.

That said, when I heard about Superior as a concept, I thought it sounded dumb as hell. Still, my curiosity got the best of me, and I gave it a look. What I discovered was one of the most fun and well written comics on the shelves. I am hooked, and entirely way too enthused about this concept.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQL4EkEHFQ8

It doesn't really spoil the movie too much other than Spider-man puts Connors in jail (big surprise)

I think it was Morbius. Before I explain why I'm going to explain why I don't think it's two of the top people that keep being listed.

**Norman Osborn**
Norman Osborn seems to be the most popular pick. But here is why that doesn't make sense:

-Disappearing act: Osborn doesn't hide in the shadows of a prison cell. And he certainly doesn't have the ability to disappear. Even if he did it's just not his shtick. Osborn wouldn't pop out of the shadows. He'd walk into the visitor's lounge with an entourage of guards. Why? Because he's one of the most politically powerful men in New York. He has no reason to sneak around.

-Looks: Whoever was in that cell had aged hands and wild unkept hair. Osborn is a business stiff with a clean cut who's roughly in his 40s maybe even late 30s. Appearances are important to Osborn. He wouldn't be that shaggy. Even if he was sick, which the man in the cell doesn't appear to be.


**Electro**
People seem to be guessing him because of the lightning bolt before and after the man is in the cell. But here is why I don't believe it's Electro.

-No sign of lightning entering the cell: When Electro enters a room he enters the fucking room. There are no scorch marks. No smoke. The man himself generates no electricity. And when he disappears the camera is even facing him at the time. No lightning bolt carrys him away. Just the light itself.

-He looks NOTHING like electro. For one thing: Electro is [bald](http://i.imgur.com/HxxuO.jpg)

-His career doesn't match. He's an electrical engineer. Not a scientist. Certainly not a guy with any expertise in cross species genetics. There is almost nothing that would make him work directly with Connors and Richard. 

So that's why I think almost everyone is wrong with those 2 choices. But here is why I'm right 

**Morbius:**

-Morbius is a living vampire. It would make sense for him to be in the shadows. Especially if he's hiding from Osborn.

-He's a scientist, and thanks to the video game, we know for a fact he has worked directly with Connors and Richards on the Lizard formula. He kept insisting that Connors focused more on bats than lizards. 

-The looks match. Long black jacket. Aged hands. Long shaggy hair.

-One of the camera angles strangely focused on Connor's neck. Was this what Morbius was focused on, trying to fight his hunger? 

What do you guys think of my theory?

Hey guys I am TOTALLY stoked for The Amazing Spider-Man 2! Electro, Rhino, Harry Osborne, and Mary Jane all being added to the mix from Amazing Spider-Man 1 sounds like it will be a blast. I posted just after The Amazing Spider-Man how I thought the movie would go, now with all of this information I want to present my updated thoughts on how it could go.
Based on all casting knowledge and such we know that Electro, Rhino, and Harry OsBorne are all going to be in the mix and potential threats to Peter Parker. First bit I want to mention is the casting of Colm Feore, who's character hasn't been revealed yet. I have a strong feeling Colm Feore will be playing Norman Osborne, he would fit the profile of the man we saw at the end of ASM in the shadows, and there's no way they aren't going to introduce the character by this point in the game.

Rhino, which was a super surprising inclusion to me should be a lot of fun. I have a feeling Webb will not try to go the route of developing an origin story for these villains, I think he's setting up a big ASM universe, where he doesn't necessarily give each and every villain a full origin and extensive character arc. Peter Parker is the star of the show and that's what I think is the focus from here out. I can see Rhino being a villain used at the opening of the movie, sort of as an introductory action set piece to bring us up to speed on Peter Parker

Electro will be awesome, played by Jamie Foxx too is going to be great, although I think this villain in particular will have a character arc throughout the movie, as in we will see some form of origin and resolution to his character, I'm still curious as to how much of the movie will be focused on Electro. Which brings me to my next point, because I have a feeling that the final showdown of the movie will not be with Electro, but the Green Goblin.

I think that Electro will be the central protagonist of the movie for sure, but I have a feeling that if we are dealing with a 2 and a half hour movie, the last half hour could serve as our first encounter between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin, ending with the death of Gwen Stacy. You may be thinking WOW this sounds like an awful lot to fit into a movie, but trust me this isn't even the half of it… 

This is because I also have a feeling that the black suit, and Venom will make an appearance in the movie. Call me crazy, but I think that Harry Osborne's character in this movie, will become Venom. This is why. The synopsis describes that Harry Osborne is an old childhood friend of Peter's, very much like Eddie Brock in the Ultimate Universe. Harry Osborne could serve to provide Peter with some insight into the kind of work his father did, and would also explain a potential relationship between Norman Osborne and his father (which was hinted at at the end of ASM). The black suit could also be what causes Spider-Man to make a poor decision leading to Gwens death at his own hands. The movie could then end with Harry finding out that Peter did in fact take the symbiote, when Peter goes to get rid of it, and Harry getting mighty mad about this and eventually bonding with it just like in Ultimate Spider-Man. The after the credits bit could then be a nice set up for the Venom spin off.

I wouldn't just make the assumption that Venom and the black suit is in the movie out of thin air though, recently Marc Webb sent out some very suggestive tweets on the matter.

Here is a picture of where the symbiote was stored in Ultimate Spider-Man: 

http://www.cinemablend.com/images/news/35583/_1360201279.jpg

Now here's a tweet that Marc Webb tweeted out on February 6, the third day of filming ASM2. 

https://twitter.com/MarcW/status/299315202447536128/photo/1

The tweet has the hashtag #happybirthday. February 6 is Dane DeHaans birthday, so whatever is in this locker is a ""birthday present"" for Dane DeHaan. The number of the locker is also the same one as in Ultimate Spider-Man! This is too close to being a coincidence.

So how do I think the movie will progress? We will be brought up to speed after a battle between Spider-Man and Rhino on what Peter has been up to the past few months of being a hero. Peter meets Harry who tells him that their parents used to work together. Electro shows up causing all sorts of trouble, him and Spidey rumble. Harry shows Peter the symbiote, Peter gets the black suit, fights Electro again, stops him for good maybe? During all this time Norman Osborne is being established as a rising threat. Finally there is a showdown between Spider-Man and the Green Goblin (Norman already knows that Peter is Spider-Man, and can use knowledge of this to use Gwen hostage against him). Spider-Man in haste makes a poor decision that causes for Gwen to die at his own hands and the Green Goblin to get away. Peter gets rid of the symbiote, which finds its way to Harry.

Of course my analysis is only looking into the action and villain side of things, I have no idea on the drama side of things involving Mary Jane, Aunt May and the rest of the supporting cast. Should be exciting though.

TL;DR: I think ASM2 will have Rhino, Electro, the Green Goblin, the Black suit and even Venom in it without being a bloated movie.

With the origin story out of the way, and I'm guessing a running time of 2 and a quarter, to 2 and a half hours, I think I have a pretty awesome idea for how The Amazing Spider-Man 2 should go.

Just pivotal plot points and characters, not in any particular order.

Peter needs to get a job at The Daily Bugle (of course for taking pictures of Spider-Man), and JK Simmons really, really needs to come back and Play J. Jonah Jameson. I can't picture any other actor playing the role.
There can be several motivations for Peter to need a job. With Uncle Ben gone Aunt May has been running through their savings, Peter wants to start saving for College, or maybe being Spider-Man is just plain expensive.

Eddie Brock as a character needs to be established.
Not Venom, Eddie Brock. Considering that this franchise is interested in exploring Peter's parents story, it would be best to follow the Ultimate Spider-Man comic where Peter and Eddie's fathers were both scientist partners at Oscorp (may feel like a retread of the first Amazing Spider-Man movie but still a logical possibility) working on the symbiote a black goo/suit substance that could potentially cure cancer . We then find out that Peter and Eddie's fathers both were killed by Oscorp higher ups (Osborne? Ratha?)  As their desire was to use the suit as a weapon, rather than a cancer cure.
So Peter and Eddie Brock rekindle a childhood friendship, and Eddie shows Peter the symbiote, the last thing that Eddie has of his father's. Classic Peter being curious goes into Oscorp one night, and ends up bonding with the symbiote, creates tension between Peter and Eddie, Eddie begins to resent Peter.

The Black Suit.
Hopefully it looks way cooler than it did in Spider-Man 3. Peter will be stronger, but also more ignorant, and care less about trying to be responsible with his powers. Also the symbiote can create it's own webs so he doesn't need web shooters. He will reach a tragic turning point where he decides he must get rid of the black suit. Tragic point will be discussed later.

Norman Osborne becomes the Green Goblin.
Norman Osborne can be the man that has the answers Peter has been looking for about his parents and such, knows about his father's research and why his father and Eddie's were killed over the symbiote. Not sure exactly how but I'm sure there will be a logical explanatio and motivation for him to become the Green Goblin (suggestions welcome). The Green Goblin will be the main villain in this movie.

Mary Jane is introduced.
New girl at Peter's school sounds like an easy way to set it up. I guess she has a crush on Peter. Gwen picks up on this, and it sets up a love triangle. Peter and Gwen are still a couple, but Gwen is still jealous. Peter's attitude with the symbiote may lead him to pay more attention to Mary Jane, or just, be careless regarding his relationship with Gwen. Again making Gwen more jealous.

Aunt May discovers Peter is Spider-Man
Either she finds out, or always had a hunch. Seeing Peter show up beaten up every night definitely has to take a toll on Aunt May in someway, it seemed to distress her a lot in the first movie, so please lets not make her a completely oblivious character.

Gwen Stacy dies.
Peter and the Green Goblin are having their penultimate battle on the George Washington Bridge. It will end with the Green Goblin dropping a bus of children, and Gwen Stacy and even though this will seem like a big retread of Raimi's first Spider-Man, the results of this battle are much different, being that Gwen Stacy dies. This happens because Peter Parker catches the bus of children, and shoots a web to catch Gwen Stacy, however she is falling too fast, and this snaps her neck on impact.
First off Peter fights this battle wearing the black suit, this clouds his judgement and in some way because he has been over confident and ignorant, this led to Gwen being captured by the Green Goblin in the first place (Again, open to suggestions as to how the black suit leads to Gwen being captured).

Peter gets rid of the symbiote.
Seeing as how the black suit has made him a darker and more reckless character, and feeling responsible for the death of Gwen, Peter gets rid of the black suit (not sure if that is at the church scene like in the animated series or just, throws it away somehow, again, suggestions).

Final Battle with Green Goblin.
Peter back in the red and blues goes for a final showdown with the Green Goblin. I don't know how this should go down, I would like to think that the Green Goblin doesn't die, as there has already been enough death in Peter's life by this point. Peter defeats the Green Goblin, and he tells Peter about his father. Gives a bit more resolution to the story of Peter's parents, while still leaving some points to be explored further in the sequel.

The ending.
Gwens funeral, Peter arrives with Aunt May and Mary Jane (the aren't a couple, they are just friends). However during this time, Mary Jane is Peter's shoulder to cry on, naturally in the third movie this could develop into a romance. No need to rush it though.

After the Credits Stinger
Shot of Eddie somehow getting the Symbiote, hopefully exactly like when he becomes venom at the end of the original Amazing Spider-Man comic. We see a wall of Eddie's home covered in information on Peter Parker, maybe some evidence that he's spiderman, and then we see him quickly transform into Venom and a cut to black.
I'm obviously biased, but Venom is my favorite Spider-Man villain, and with Sony already saying that their venom movie is going to be died in to The Amazing Spider-Man franchise this could work perfectly. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 will come out May 2014. Venom could come out any time between then and The Amazing Spider-Man 3. This will help explore Eddie's character further (maybe there could be an Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker Cameo in the movie). Then after having a fully fleshed out Eddie Brock and Venom from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and the Venom spinoff movie, we can finally have the Spider-Man and Venom showdown movie we have always wanted in the Amazing Spider-Man 3.

Also a couple things I think I should mention. I think it would be best to not have Harry Osborne in the franchise, just because I his character had plenty of exposition in Raimi's trilogy.

Also I know some people may not like the idea of Gwen's character dying in the second movie and leaving it for the third movie, but I really think that because their romance was so well done in The Amazing Spider-Man and will continue to be so in the second movie, it will be that much more abrupt and shocking to Peter's character, and also serves as the perfect motivation for Peter to abandon the black suit.

I know I haven't fleshed out too many of the plot points, but please comment and such let me know what you guys think!

EDIT: Also to make it clear, I don't want people to believe that I want #2 as a Venom movie. It is a Green Goblin movie very much, I just want the character of Eddie Brock to get the proper build up and introduction that he deserves.",,False,self,t5_2rw42,1341340059.0,,,True,t3_vzmh1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/vzmh1/how_i_think_the_amazing_spiderman_2_should_go/,

1376737626.0,21,self.Spiderman,1kjmjh,Character of After Credits ASM Theory,znelson15,22,1,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/1kjmjh/character_of_after_credits_asm_theory/,"This topic has long been ignored since the release of the first Amazing Spider-man by both the fans and the filmmakers. This is about a possible theory behind the man in the shadows in the after credits scene of ASM that I haven’t seen else ware.

- WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SAID

First I will go over what had already been sad a year ago, because if I say who I think it is now many won’t even consider reading on.
The first reaction of many was its Norman Osborn because of the hat he was carrying around while not showing his face similar to the old comics
in addition to appearing ill as Osborn was said to be earlier in the movie. This has been stated false by Rhys Ifans “It’s not Norman Osborn. But it is someone who is in the employ of Norman Osborn without question…Who knows? Maybe he will be the next bad guy; we’ll see.”
”(LINK) A year later it has already been announced Chris Cooper will be portraying Norman. 
	Another idea many had was that Electro was hinted at because of the lightning. While Electro is the films next antagonist and an employee of Oscorp, as Ifans said, he is being portrayed by Jamie Foxx.
	Going with what Ryan Ifans said about the character being an employee of Oscorp, and believing his character won’t be unnecessarily be reinvented, I am excluding speculations of characters like Mysterio and Sandman (said to be alluded to by the disappearing act), the Scorpion, Kraven the Hunter, and Rhino (also has an actor Paul Giamatti). The man in the shadows will be a scientist.
	Based on the dialogue the Man in The Shadows worked with Dr. Connors and Peter’s Dad, so his work should be genetic based. This excludes Dr. Octopus, The Tinker, Shocker, and Vulture whose fields have nothing to do with genetics. I also exclude Smyth because they agreed not to reuse characters used in the ASM video game. Morbius is owned by owners of Blade(Marvel) so, he isn’t really worth considering. 
	
- MY THEORY

The only geneticist I can think of left, was also obsessed with Parker’s DNA, who also fits the character type is Miles Warren, AKA The Jackal. Before you shoot it down with “I REALLY HATE CLONES and 90s writing!!! It also enforces my theory of VENOM’s origin and eventual solo movie. More on that in section 3.
I hated the clone saga just as much as others who have read it, but I believe Michael Massee can bring him more justice than anything else. Miles Warren originally played a small role as Pete’s Professor(first appearance ASM #31, Same as Gwen). In the scene where Peter and Gwen break up, in may have meant something when Gwen said “Two of my teachers showed up.” (to the funeral) Miles later became The Jackal (ASM#129, exactly 1 year after Gwen Died, whose death put him into the depression that caused him to turn himself into the Jackal). Jackal does not mean clone saga, but based on the version of Richard Parker and the Clone Saga from Brian Bendis’s Ultimate Spider-man, I have an Idea how Venom can be introduced and brought into his own movie, without being disappointing.

- HOW THIS OPENS UP TO A VENOM ORIGIN TIE IN

Venom has many origins; the first cannot be redone because it was from a machine found during the secret wars (Which includes so many characters nobody holds the rights to them). In the nineties cartoon the symbiote came from a rock on the moon, in Spider-man 3: an asteroid, but the most fitting is From the Ultimate comics as creation of Richard Parker, in search of a cure for cancer. Sound familiar? Richard even based the symbiote on his own DNA. This is similar to the idea that Peter’s powers were only triggered by the spider bite and were embedded in him as an experiment, which likely was cut from the movie to be released in future installments (We can only hope. Unless that whole thing just gets shot to hell) . See here for the THE UNTOLD STORY. These connections suggest that Venom and Spider-man were the result of connected experiments, which could in the future be used as a reason for venom having spider like powers and being attracted to him without ever having to bond with him in the first place, and Parker DNA may be he key to both, which is what the Jackal has been known to obsess about in the past.
	In the ultimate comics, Carnage came first, grown by doctor Connors in the form of Richard Parker and Killing Gwen. In the Comics Richard Parker Worked with Eddie Brock Sr. (Ultimate Spider-man) to make Venom, who may fit as well as The Jackal, but I feel the Jackal fits the silhouette better.
	
- ADDITIONAL USE OF THE CHARACTER

The Ultimate Clone Saga is the closest Spider-man ever comes to finding his father, when Dr. Octopus takes the place of the Jackal (only because he was already introduced and Jackal wasn’t) to clones. One of them is an aged Peter Parker brainwashed into thinking he is Richard Parker. Another is a Gwen, who continued to live with Peter and his aunt. This felt worth mentioning because it allows Gwen to be killed without Emma Stone going away.

tl;dr Man in the Shadows=Jackal

This is all I can say about this game! I mean this game knows what it's like to be Spidey and it gives you that experience! You get everything, from Stealth, combat, spidey sense and then to the web slinging (I'll get to that soon). This isn't really a review but more of a ""good rant.""

First off I'll say that this is the best intro to a Spiderman game, the game starts off with you as Peter in a first person mode being guided by Gwen. It reminded me a lot of the beginning to Deus Ex Human Revolution and I just loved it.

What are the best parts of the game?

- Web rush (it really is the star of this game)
- The story is actually really awesome, especially the ending
- The interesting characters (the guy who plays spidey is fantastic)
- The games intro
- Web Slinging
- Web zip/rush combined into ""Spider Parkour""
- The outdoor graphics
- Side missions (there are tons of these things)
- The variety in the missions
- Lack of repetitive gameplay
- The stealth, think Shattered Dimensions but x100
- Character relationships

And sooooo much more!

I enjoyed every minute of this game (not EVERY minute really, there were one or two levels that had a really bad level design) but still this game really gets Spiderman and his allies right, it even has some great jokes in it! For example, at one stage ""someone"" mentions a cross species Bat/man and Peter says something like ""Half Bat half man! A Batman? Come on thats ridiculous!"" Even though I am a huge Batman fan, that comment made me laugh.

Now this isn't a perfect game, it does have a few flaws such as:

- The indoor graphics are quite often pretty choppy
- Lots of jagged edges indoors (No doubt fixed with a PC release)
- Sometimes the levels (Side missions) are quite similiar
- It does give one or two MAJOR movie spoilers (which I regret hearing)
- And the loading times are SO ANNOYING! Its like a whole minute to leave your apartment

These are my only complaints with this game and lets admit that they are minor ones!

But if I were to give this game a rating of sorts it would easily be a solid 9/10... a few graphical flaws and level design stops it from being a perfect game :D

I have an interesting theory on who the mystery man is!",MasterDeBaitor,29,12,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/11qlqw/so_i_just_now_saw_the_amazing_spiderman_i_have_an/,"As you all probably already know, after the feature film there is a short scene which is a teaser for the next film.  In this scene there is a mysterious man who appears and disappears.  I am not going to go into detail about the scene for spoilers, and because I am assuming if you are reading this post you saw it.  

There is many several theories to who it is, from the more popular speculations like Norman Osbourne or Papa Parker; to the less known guesses like Mysterio, Electro, Krane, and the Chameleon.  My wild theory involves none of them.  

Right away I am going to tell you who I think it is, now this is more kind of a hope or dream.  While I know they are trying to be more realistic, this can be done.  I hope it is Doctor Strange!  The man that visits in the cell is an older man with silverish gray facial hair, that could possibly be Strange.  The man is depicted wearing fine clothing and a hat, also could possibly be Strange.  The man enter and exits the room pretty much by teleportation, also possibly Strange.  

Now before I get downvoted into oblivion hear me out.  You may say Strange isn't a bad guy!  This is true, I don't think he would be used as a bad guy.  I think he would be more of a messenger, a messenger but for who.  Easy, Madam Web!  He tells the Lizard, ""We shall leave him alone for now.""  Who does he mean by We?  Could he mean the Lizard and himself?  Osbourne as an employer and this mysterious man? Or Madam Web and Strange?

Web and Strange have both had major interactions with Peter and could both be tied into the story with clever writing.  While this is a more outlandish theory, I think it is one that could be pretty cool. 


Update:  General consensus so far is that it is either Electro because of the lightning entrance and Exit.  Adrian Tombes Aka the Vulture, because he could be employed by Osborne.  Or my favorite guess I read was Morbius, I don't know how they would tie him in but he is also a huge love interest in Gwen's life.

I've been working plot summaries for the next few spider-man movies. I'll post the second one here and if there's significant interest I'll post more. As of right now I have enough for three trilogies(9 films).

**The Amazing Spider-Man 2**- The film begins with Peter struggling to maintain his daily life while still protecting the city from crime. He continues to push Gwen away on her late father's wishes, but is secretly miserable because of it, as is Gwen. Gwen begins working with an OsCorp biochemist, Dr. Michael Morbius, and the leader of Oscorp's son, Harry Osborne. Morbius begins secretly working on some sort of serum and informs Harry and Gwen that he is, in fact, dying. He decides not to tell his wife, Martine, and works on the serum night and day for weeks. Morbius begins using distilled bat fluids to give himself energy. 

A widowed down-on-his-luck scientist working at OsCorp, Maxwell Dillon, begins working with electrotherapy in order to create a more effective way to combat disease. His experiment goes wrong, and Dillon is electrocuted. Instead of being killed, however, the freak accident caused a mutagenic change in his nervous system, allowing him to generate and control vast amounts of electricity. With nowhere left to turn and no way to feed his two daughters, Dillon turns to a life of crime as the mastermind Electro.

Peter begins searching for a job in photography, and finds one at the Daily Bugle working under J. Jonah Jameson. Peter is assigned to photographing for Broadway shows, where he meets a struggling actress, Mary Jane Watson. Electro begins stealing from small time grocery stores, but soon moves onto thieving from a large bank in the area. Jameson tries to play Electro off as Spider-Man's alter-ego, which Peter tries hard to fight but is unsuccessful. The public now views Spider-Man as a criminal, and shun him. 

Gwen and Harry become close, which causes Peter to begin getting close to Mary Jane in an effort to make Gwen jealous. Gwen and Peter's love continues to evolve as they get back together, effectively disregarding Gwen's father's wishes. 

Electro becomes angry that he is not getting the recognition he deserves, and vows to kill Spider-Man. The Daily Bugle is attacked by Electro, who has learned to harness his powers properly. Jameson tells Dillon that he believes Spider-Man and Peter Parker are tied together somehow. Dillon begins spying on Parker, and discovers everything about him. He kidnaps Gwen and Aunt May and brings them to the Coney Island pier. As expected, Peter follows him there. A large battle ensues, until Electro shocks Spider-Man with charged energy from a transformer on the pier. Before he kills Spider-Man, Dr. Morbius shows up and pleads with Dillon not to do it, saying he is a good man and there are other ways to feed his daughters. Spider-Man notices a broken piece of the pier under him before Dillon shoots Morbius with a charged blast, seemingly killing him. Spider-Man punches the piece of the pier and intentionally falls into the ocean, and drags Electro along with him, shorting Dillon out and killing him. Peter takes Aunt May and Gwen back home.

The film the flashes back to all the important moments in Peter's life(him being handed over to his aunt and uncle, Uncle Ben's funeral, his first time as Spider-Man, his first fight with the Lizard, him saying good-bye to Gwen) and reveals that Morbius has been at all those major events. it then shows a picture on Morbius's desk of Morbius and Richard Parker standing together, revealing the knew each other in some capacity. Morbius's eye opens and is now a dark red.

In the post-credits scene, Morbius is now sitting at his desk at OsCorp, alive. He is sitting in the dark. A hooded figure appears and walks in and sits down across from Morbius. ""I think it's time for us to come out of the shadows, Michael."" the figure says. Morbius is quiet for a while.

""What the hell do you want from me, Norman?"" he says, and the film ends. ",,False,self,t5_2rw42,False,,,True,t3_14z282,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/14z282/my_ideas_for_a_perfect_tasm_2/,

At some point, Mark Webb stated that the web-shooters were meant be worn under regular clothes and that they looked like watches (need a link for this).

Here's a picture - http://www9.pcmag.com/media/images/293591-web-shooters.jpg

Good Video here - http://www.movieweb.com/news/the-amazing-spider-man-web-shooter-blue-prints-and-video

**Question # 1** -  How were the web shooters not completely noticeable during the dinner scene with Gwen's family? The handle to release the web goes halfway down his hand. Also shaking hands with anyone would immediately give them away. Thoughts?

**My second question** - How do the web-shooters fit over the suit when he puts the suit on? It seems that the trigger release goes UNDER his glove, but the actual web-shooter remains OVER his suit. Did he cut a hole in the suit for that purpose?

Related Picture -http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120703211025/amazingspiderman/images/archive/6/6d/20120712025403!Web-Shooters.jpg


**My third question** - How do the webshooters stay attached to his wrist in the suit? It seems like there is no contraption to keep it attached, as the suit is skin tight.

Related picture - http://jessekavadlo.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/the-amazing-spider-man-movie-image-close-up-600x283.jpg


Anyone else notice these small plot holes related to the web-shooters? I loved the built web-shooters and I understand the history they have for Spider-man, but they way they were handled in the movie made me upset. 


Any discussion would be welcome!

So my question is, what do you guys want to see in the Goblin? Appearance and personality wise?

Personally, I want to see more of an Ultimate Goblin. Big, buffed up but still extremely sinister. I like the original goblin a lot, but there's something about the Ultimate version that would work well in a movie.

I want the whole plot line about Norman threatening Peter, I want to see that tension done well on screen. Maybe they can even include scenes where you can see and feel what really goes on in Norman/Goblin's head.


Of course, Green Goblin isn't guaranteed to be in the movies, but there is a lot pointing towards it. Not including the fact that he owns Oscorp.",,False,self,t5_2rw42,False,,,True,t3_wd0az,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/wd0az/green_goblin_in_the_amazing_spiderman/,

(Movie Spoilers),Imanaverageguy,19,3,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Spiderman/comments/w3p34/why_do_people_hate_when_movies_break_from_the/,"So I saw The Amazing Spiderman and loved it, absolutely loved it. I've read several (not all) of the older spiderman comics but I didn't mind when things went differently in the movie (like how Gwen knows about Spiderman instead of being ignorant). I know its got to follow the ideas of the comics in some ways, but what's so wrong with having its own unique plot?

Honestly I would be THRILLED if Gwen stays as Peter's love interest and Mary Jane doesn't get involved seriously. I never liked Mary Jane. She's like the Princess Peach of Spiderman. Ever since I was a kid I preferred Gwen and I still do. Yet I know Gwen is SUPPOSED to be killed by the Green Goblin so Peter winds up with MJ. 

So why is it that when I tell people I wish the movie could follow a different route comic fans get upset? I'm not saying that the movie should ignore the comics, but why can't they do what they want with it and make it a change of pace for everyone? Would it honestly be better to just watch a version of a plot where you know exactly what will happen? Because that sounds boring to me.

Maybe I'm just biased. Its also distinctly possible I never want to watch Emma Stone die...she's probably one of my favorite actresses. Anyway this was just sort of a rant but maybe someone out there has something to say on the subject?

If a Venom movie does come along, then he should definitely be in the trilogy at some point. Norman Osborn coming in as the Green Goblin would be pretty cool, but it would have to be a fresh and exciting take on the character since we've already seen him in Spider-Man (2002). I also think it would be interesting if they adapted parts of The Clone Saga into film. I also hope that Mary Jane and Harry Osborn are brought into the cast as well.

When I was a kid I was really in to Spider-Man (90s) and diligently read the comics for many years. This came to an end with the clone saga, when I felt they kind of wrote themselves in to a corner, and I was extremely put off by the resurrection of Aunt May, which after Amazing #400 I thought was a complete cop out. It also seemed like a natural place to conclude as I entered my teenage years; I have never had any interest in the Ultimate universe or anything other than the original Peter, who started in the 60s and goodness knows what has happened to him now.    
      
It occurs to me there are many stories from the 60s until the clone saga that I haven't read and would really enjoy, but I can't go around collecting comics as I am leaving my home coutntry in May and have to divest myself of all physical property. So my question is this: is there a way to read, on a computer, all Spider-Man comics (preferably including Web of and Spectacular etc.) in chronological order from the character's inception to the clone saga?

As for what I think, I can't really decide.

He (Spider-man) has his own large universe that can handle itself without any connection to The Avengers. I think a few winks/nods would be nice, also now that I think of it, I would almost rather Avengers characters appearing in Spider-man's movies rather than the other way around, like Iron Man specifically, because their relationship was always cool.

Originally there existed only /r/Spider_Man. But then /r/Spiderman got popular and we decided to merge these two and provide users an exclusive approach in experiencing the subreddits by only allowing the comic discussions in /r/Spider_Man and other posts in /r/Spiderman. 

But recently there has been discussions going on among the users if we really need two subs and why dont we just make a single sub for all spiderman. So i decided to take the sub's thoughts into the matter by making this poll.

Kindly take this poll for the sake of feedback and we will act accordingly. (this poll is combined for both the subs)

Thank you! :)

P.S: Kindly Upvote this post so that everyone can see! I receive no karma whatsoever.

Edit: We haven't corresponded with /r/spidey so there havent been any communication with them and please dont ask us to combine with /r/SpideyMeme since we would like to keep the memes out of this subreddit.


This poll will close on thursday midnight! :)

For those of you who don't know, there are rumors floating about that they might ""Ang Lee"" Peter Parker in this new franchise in the sense that Peter Parker's father will put something in his DNA that enables him to become Spider-Man. Yes, yes, I know, that sounds UGLY and brings back some bad memories.

When I first heard about this, I was bummed. The appealing part of Peter Parker was that he was average guy and just happened to gain these powers by accident. It also made me worry about how Uncle Ben would be treated if it was Peter's cinematic destiny to become Spider-Man. However, hear me out...

For one, this gave me some sense of relief that we wouldn't just be seeing another Spider-Man origin that would, at the center of it all, strongly resemble Sam Raimi's origin from Spider-Man 1. While it does stray from the source material, at least it will be a new and fresh take on the character.

Now onto the nitty gritty of it all.

Does this change Peter Parker or Spider-Man as a character at all? I mean, honestly, not really. When I think of Peter Parker, I actually rarely consider the circumstances surrounding his origin as a superhuman as part of what makes him great. His humanity, awkwardness, and his ability to discern responsible vs. irresponsible are. If this power lies dormant within him, and it's awakened with this spider bite? The idea, in and of itself, is actually one that could prove to be extremely fruitful in the progression and development of the character in this universe.

It seems as though Peter's father will be working on this revolutionary project, that he desperately wants to use for good. However he's worried it will get in the hands of the wrong people (cough Norman Osborn cough). I think his father, knowing he's in a dead-end of a predicament will instill what he's developed in Peter to keep the project hidden, but alive. Peter's eventual transformation into Spider-Man and doing good and upholding the wellbeing of people was what his father dreamed of. It's actually brilliant storytelling.

Naturally, this brings up caution of the treatment of Uncle Ben. But will his importance in the origin story really be abused or ignored? I don't think so.

Yes, Peter's father hides this power within him, but who is there to teach him how to harness it and use it for good? Richard isn't, but Ben is. Just because Peter's father gives him this power, does not mean Peter will know how to use it, and that's where Uncle Ben's cruciality has always lied.

In essence, Richard gives Peter his powers, but Uncle Ben gives Peter his moral compass and his constant desire to do good.

You know the part in the movie [just before Peter Parker enters the room with the genetically modified spiders whose web is harvested to created ropes and stuff?](/spoiler) 


I remember seeing that [to enter the door, an employee had to sort of go through a lock screen](/spoiler). 


I remember him [positioning a ball to the top-left and then dragging another ball on top of the other ball to unlock 
the door to the room in question](/spoiler)


What I was wondering is;

1) What was [that room called that Parker went into](/spoiler)?

and 2) Is there any [android app on the market that would mimik the operation of said lock](/spoiler)?


I think it would be pretty cool if such a thing were developed. Any insight anyone?

I don't think she's going to be Betty Brandt which is the other popular theory, I'm interested to see what they do with Felicity though because they already have Mary Jane and Gwen which will most likely for a love-triangle, and adding Black Cat will make it convoluted for sure.

Also, the treatment of Venom / Harry Osborn actually makes them even better characters than before, and they were already awesome. The Venom Symbiote being the ""Drug"" that Harry is hooked on is amazing. I am only on episode 15, but I love it.
