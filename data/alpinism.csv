There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever. Oh, we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes, and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation. But otherwise nothing will come of it. We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver, not a gem, nor any coal or iron. We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food. It's no use. If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it, that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward, then you won't see why we go. What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy. And joy is, after all, the end of life. We do not live to eat and make money. We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life. That is what life means and what life is for.

I was going to attempt to summit Albert Edward but Mother Nature had other plans. There was a blizzard the day I was going to head up and 60cm (2ft) of snow was deposited everywhere including the road. I wasn't even able to get to the trailhead until 6pm.

I decided to hike until dark, dig a cave to sleep in, then head back in the morning. 

So, onto my cave. Here are the [before and after](http://imgur.com/a/yt24e) shots. As you can see, the cave came dangerously close to collapsing on me in my sleep. Looking back, I made 3 mistakes in building it.

1. Location: I had just crossed a lake and decided to build the cave in a wind drift on a point on the edge of the lake (sorry no pic of the location). When I dug down, I eventually hit slush. Which meant I was still over top of the lake. I stuck  my ice axe in and hit solid rock about 45cm below the slush so I stuck to this location because I was confident my tunnel and sleeping platform were safely over top of land.

2. depth: when I started making my ceiling I had broken through the crusty old snow and was cutting into the fresh snow that had fallen that day. It seemed stable enough when I was cutting into it but snow is fairly flexible when it is fresh. With the heat my body produced and the weight of the fresh snow pressing down, it started to slump down in the center.

3. Ceiling shape: In the picture, you can see that I made my cave fairly boxy. This is not the best design (as I realized in the morning). The ceiling should be arched and hand smoothed for both melting and strength. A good cave will insulate you very well so your body heat will melt the snow. If there are ridges, bumps or low spots in the ceiling, it creates an area for water droplets to collect and drip. With my design, the moisture formed in all kinds of areas and eventually as the snow slumped down, the moisture accumulated more in the center, creating a central heavy point that got worse and worse as the night went on.

In the morning I woke up to the ceiling resting/dripping on my shoulder. I was zipped up tightly in my bivy and sleeping bag. Had the roof fully collapsed, I would have had trouble unzipping and freeing myself from the bag and snow before I suffocated. I was lucky this time. Next time I won't make the same mistakes.

tl;dr: Built a snow cave and came very close to having the ceiling collapse on me.",,False,self,t5_2rjam,True,,,True,t3_qyvjq,http://www.reddit.com/r/alpinism/comments/qyvjq/making_a_snow_cave_what_not_to_do/,

Always wear more sunscreen than you think you need. This is after suffering from the worst sunburns of my life.


The second lesson I learned is to pace yourself. My climbing partner and I were flying up the mountain with fully loaded packs (45lbs ~ 20.4kg), at one point we're talking 1200 feet in an hour. By the time we made camp we were drenched in sweat (didn't help with the sunscreen situation) and exhausted. We both ended up suffering from some minor dehydration in the night which combined with high winds ultimately led to our decision to not make a summit attempt.

The second day we begun early, to avoid the crowd at the summit, just a before reaching the Col. de Bionnassay my friend made a wrong step and falls, it was very early so the ice was hard us a rock, he couldn't stop, throwing me backwards. We slip down over 200 mts. For me was a eternity, nothing could stop us, and every second we where speeding up. Suddenly we where in the bottom of a crevasse 6 meter below the ground. Hour and a half  latter I could get out of it (you donÂ´t imagine what was that), but when I came out i notice we where in a place way out the route, with the pain, i couldnÂ´t focus where we where, i was very confused and very very cold. My rib hurts like a bitch so I couldnÂ´t move a lot, my friend was in pain in the bottom, i begun getting really nervous. Fortunately when i was trying to figure out what to do, because i didn't see nobody that could help us, two guys over a ridge eventually saw me. After a while trying to make some sort of comunication by signals they call an helicopter, a hour later i was in Aosta Hospita. I only had contusions, sprains, and a my nose broken. My friend had a vertebral problem, and his sternum broken. 
If it wasnÂ´t for the helicopter and the guys over the Aig. of Bionnassay who spotted us, we where been in serious problem, and of course the helmet, always use helmet.

I just wanted to say something about the spam filter. 

It's inaccurate. 

I just cleaned a ton of great content out of the spam filter that nobody ever got to see because nobody said anything. 

Ultimately it's the job of the moderators (i.e. me) to check and make sure good posts aren't getting caught, but we need your help. If you post a new topic, and it doesn't show up on the page almost immediately, it may be caught in the filter. 

If that happens PLEASE click the little thing on the right that says ""message the moderators"" and send us the name of the post. It will message all three of us, and one of us will take care of it. 

Again, I apologize for dropping the ball on not checking, but if you want your content to be seen you should probably help yourself out.

And if we are not active in the subreddit, then there is obviously no moderation going on as well.  

Perhaps one result of this is /r/mountaineering, which came about roughly 1 year ago (/r/alpinism is 3ish) and apparently has many posts in common - this seems unnecessary.   

If anyone has the willingness to help moderate /r/alpinism in a more appropriate direction, please contact me and I'll see if it's a good fit.    

I also invite discussion as to what sorts of material readers come to /r/alpinism hoping to find?  Is there enough of it to support an active subreddit?   If you have an interest or input in this, please contribute some ideas!


**Edit:**   Ok, so far there isn't much complaint regarding the dueling subreddits, so we can continue to leave them separate at the moment until there is more interest in combining them (don't even know how that would work).   I also 86'd an absent mod and extended an invitation to a user who has been active here.

We'll see how that goes for a bit I guess.    I still welcome input and suggestions!

**Edit 2:**  I'll put a link to this post in the sidebar to allow ongoing discussion as to the state of the sub.  If anyone in the future has suggestions about the direction of the subreddit amongst its sibling subreddits they have but to comment here and something magical will happen or something.

(+Photos),NikoIsAJerk,17,1,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/alpinism/comments/y5w38/climbed_mt_adams_this_weekend_my_first_climb/,"Photos from the trip are [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/41124415@N03/sets/72157631052986946/) , with some descriptions.

I've always been pretty enamored with the mountains, though I grew up in Minnesota, so, finding stuff to climb and ski was pretty hard. I moved to Washington about two and a half years ago. I've hence done a few ski laps on Mt. Rainier's Muir Snowfield, often wondering what a summit would be like up there, and looking to the surrounding peaks thinking the same. 

Rob, a friend of mine for a little more than a year, is one of the few people I've run into out here so far, anyway (not that I get out much) who actually likes mountains, snow, winter, and the like. He's climbed a few peaks, and has been trying to make it to the summit of Adams for the last 5 years or so, failing on two attempts, despite being out of shape due to being a Desk-Jockey for the better part of a decade. 

This last weekend was one we planned to climb Mt Adams on months ago. For me, it was a benchmark to test my readiness for NOLS this  fall, and for Rob, it was just one more hack at a mountain that had beaten him due to lack of preparation. Going into it, I wanted to ski, but I decided to forego the extra load I would have to carry to help in case Rob needed it. On day one, I ended up with an extra 20lbs or so from his pack by the time we were about 2/3rds through the approach to high-camp, pushing my pack up to something that felt like 65-75lbs. We made it, though, and we were already higher on the mountain than Rob had been before.

The next day I woke up feeling pretty confident. Rob was a bit shaky about his prospects. Altitude was definitely a bit of a factor for us at 9,200 feet, due mostly to the fact that we both live near sea-level. I decided to carry all the food, water, and extra gear to the top, though I made Rob wear his helmet because I didn't want to carry it. After a good-sized chunk of ice bounced quickly past us on the first pitch, I put my helmet on as well, thankfully though, I didn't need it the rest of the day. I think we were both glad the group I kept calling ""Boy Scouts"" didn't slip up, as for some reason they had decided to go up with trekking poles and bare hiking boots instead of the axes and crampons highly recommended for the route we were on. I spent a lot of time watching their feet slip above us and I kept wondering when we'd see someone involuntarily glissading into a pile of sharp, volcanic scree.

I had never been past 10,000 feet before on my own power. It was quite a feeling when we hit 10,800-11K and the steepest part of the climb simultaneously. I was definitely beginning to feel it then, though it didn't help that I am a bit of an asthmatic and I was also carrying all of the summit gear. I climbed on and Rob lumbered along, keeping a slow pace behind me.

Once we made it over the false summit at 11,700, I was pretty confident we had the climb in the bag. I was worried about Rob, but he doesn't quit. Despite being out of shape, his ability to push through and dig for his energy is pretty good. 

It took us a long time to get up top to 12,281, about 6.5 hours from leaving high-camp. I had spent a lot of it climbing a bit, turning around, and watching Rob, though I didn't mind. I wanted him to get up top because I knew it would be disappointing for the summit to elude him 3 times in a row. I kept checking his energy though. Despite most of the hike down being a Glissade, I wanted to make sure we made it down alright. 

We left the summit at about 3pm. I got to Glissade for the first time, which was a blast. I did a bit of boot glissading too, which was sort of my consolation for not being able to ski. I also got some extra ""practice"" with self arrests when I slipped and fell on my boot glissades and slid down the mountain a few times like a turtle. 

We made it back to high camp in about an hour, ate dinner, packed up, and headed down. I spent some time figuring out how to best use a plastic garbage bag to slide on slopes normally too flat for glissading. Rob and I made it down, finally, at about 10pm. Rob was so shot from all the hiking that he could barely move or stay awake. I was pretty tired too, though was able to drive back to Portland to crash at a friend's house a few hours later. 

All in all it was a success, even if I had to carry extra weight to help my friend and climbing partner this past weekend, but I guess part of climbing is team-work. We made it, which made me happy, and has definitely infected me with a bit of a summit bug. I can't wait to climb again.

A good friend took me out to the north ghost (AB, Canada) for three days and we climbed one route each day. the first day we did ""this house of sky"" ( 500M WI3-4.5) which is probably the most well known climb in the area (for a good reason, it was amazing for a first time ice climb) the second day we did a very unpopular route ""the unforgiven"" (40M WI3) which required an annoying climb up a scree pile. the last day we hit up the valley of the birds (WI2) and we climbed albatross at the end of the valley (100M WI3). it was an amazing intro to ice climbing and i highly recommend this house of sky and valley of the birds to albatross. ""the unforgiven"" had no sun and poor quality ice, also the hike up the scree pile was annoying and the wind was incredibly hard when we did it (80kmph?) and it was blowing straight down the waterfall. my climbing partner just bought a canon D90 or something so we ended up getting some decent pictures!

Quick background: Myself and my partner have been climbing for 4-5 years now, with lots of trad multipitch experience, a few big walls, and plenty of sport climbing. We have very little ice climbing experience, and no snow slope experience. In general, though, we're a pretty competent team, if I do say so myself.


In regards to a first climb, I'd love to find something to get some snow slope experience. If it's snow/glacier for the approach, and then technical rock, that would be really cool, but I'm open to all suggestions. I'm not really interested in any sort of technical ice at this point. I'd just love to get out, gain some elevation, and have a cool, new experience. We're from Michigan, so anywhere in the continental US is open, since we have to fly regardless of where we go.

We won't be taking any classes, and aren't interested in a guide. I've got a copy of Freedom of the Hills for technical knowledge, but we sort of plan to learn on the go and just wing it. Yeah, yeah, not ideal, but that's why I'm looking for some input on a first climb. Hopefully you can recommend something that is tame enough that we won't get ourselves killed, but still something to be relatively proud of.

Any other questions, let me know! Thanks much!

Since I came to (serious) alpinism quite lately, I heard various opinions on it, and was convinced that it is a dangerous practice* that should be avoided normally. (Only exceptions: A technically able partner having mental problems on moderate though exposed terrain. And on a narrow ridge, where you could try to stop a fall by jumping down the other side.)

But as I like to learn, and short-roping seems to be quite common still: What *is* it good for? When will you use it?

*) Good sources on the dangers and benefits of short-roping IMHO:

Introducing Project Challenger (A nod to Ed Viesturs' Project Endeavor)",DrunkleSwervy,16,3,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/alpinism/comments/1ca69e/hi_alpinism_ive_reset_some_of_my_life_targets_i/,"I'm a divorced 45 yo father of two, 150 pounds overweight. I have multiple weight-related health issues that I believe are easily addressed through exercise. My wife divorced me because I was a fat, out-of-shape lard-ass, it was the best wake-up call that ever happened to me. My kids are both in their teens. I've never cared about losing weight until now because I realize I had no goals. I'm a guy who needs BIG goals in order to push myself, I now realize. 

Rewind back a few months, I saw this video on reddit and it awoke something in me. I was an alpine climber and hiker in my youth. Living near Mt. Rainier I was able to climb it with a guide as a 13 year old. I climbed Mt. Baker that same year. The year before I hiked the Wonderland Trail, one of the more intense long distance hikes in Washington. I climbed countless small peaks such as Pinnacle Peak and others on the Tatoosh Range in Mount Rainier Park. This is all to say that my new goal is not a ""wild hair up my ass"" type of goal, it's more about me getting back to my roots, and talking about why I am here, at least from my perspective.

These are all experiences that imprinted on my mind and my character. I now realize that my life's calling was missed, and that I was put here on this Earth to stand on tall ground, to see the world from places where few people stand. I've reset my goals after conducting extensive research over the past few months into the realities and practicalities of mountaineering at middle age. My research has told me that with the right spirit, and physical condition, anything is possible.

I've set the goal of summiting Mt. Everest by 2022. This accounts for a first attempt in 2020. My road map begins with a climb of Mt. Adams this summer which I hope to climb with my brothers. The following summer, in 2014, I plan to climb Mt. Rainier and Mt. Olympus. In 2016, Denali, and in 2018, Cho Oyu, an 8,201 meter peak in Nepal that is used as a test summit for Everest.

If all goes well, I will achieve my goal. If I don't stand on the summit of Everest I will still have attained my life goal, which is to enjoy the wilds of the mountains, in a responsible, reverent way. Advances in technology, and in knowledge of the mountains has made summiting Everest less of a danger and risk than it once was.

This is the video that made me realize that it's never too late in life to acheive the unimaginable.  http://youtu.be/2_ybcAWTLeE

Alpinism, I would like your thoughts and recommendations. One thing I am realizing is that I may have set the target too far out into the future. Perhaps it would be conceivable for me to attempt Everest sooner, as I imagine within 2 years I will be in far better shape than I am now. So do I take Denali and Cho Oyu off the list? And substitute Mt Rainer into the picture to do a few more training climbs? Or am I better off taking my time. I'll admit, there are some missing pieces to the plan, in my opinion, but I know that they will fill in as a dive into the adventure. I would love to hear your advice and encouragement.",,False,self,t5_2rjam,False,,,True,t3_1ca69e,http://www.reddit.com/r/alpinism/comments/1ca69e/hi_alpinism_ive_reset_some_of_my_life_targets_i/,

Its the stories of the poorest of poor farmers and sheepherders, people living off the land, achieving rock star status in their little villages.

I'm planning on hiking Mount Torrey's in Colorado this Saturday. It's a 14,000 ft. peak and my first winter summit. There isn't much avalanche worry but I'm uneasy about it because I have very limited experience and have never taken an avalanche class. However, I'm going with friends who are far more knowledgable than me. 

I do have a couple questions though:

1. How do you keep water from freezing when it's ridiculously cold without fire/ while hiking?

2. How do you stay warm?

3. Anyone have a go-to website for avalanche danger?

4. Is climbing a 14'er in the dead of winter a ridiculous task? Does anyone have any experience with this?

I would climb with a guide or group for safety sakes and because it would be a really knew challenge. I was hoping someone who has climbed the Grand could give me some information on that, or if there are any other mountains that are near and have good guided climbs that would be helpful too.
Also if anyone knew where I could find a good training regiment or specific things I need to work on that would also be helpful.

BD ATHLETE COLIN HALEY ANALYZES CREVASSE FALL IN ST. ELIAS MOUNTAINS, AK
 Black Diamond athlete Colin Haley returned to the States this spring from another successful season down in Argentine Patagonia, and soon after kept heading north, bound for an attempt on Middle Peak in the St. Elias Range of Alaska with John Frieh and Daniel Harro. Soon after arriving in the range, however, Colin took an unfortunate fall into a crevasse while skiing near camp. Below is Colin's recap of the trip along with a fascinating in-depth analysis of his accident and resulting rescue. All photos courtesy of John Frieh.

 It's been an odd spring for me. The most difficult aspect of my Patagonia addiction is the conflict it creates with my skiing addiction, and after spending most of the winter in the Austral summer, I usually return home very eager to ski. This year was no exception, and after returning to Seattle I did my best to catch up, skiing nearly every day of my first week at home. The one cool thing about starting your ski season in mid March is that my first day of the season was an awesome powder day, with a snowpack of multiple meters!

At the end of March I left for a climbing trip in Alaska's St. Elias range with Portlanders John Frieh and Daniel Harro. While I was finishing up my Patagonia season, John, super organized as always, put in some writing effort, and got funding for the trip, courtesy of the Mugs Stump Award, Mazamas Expedition Grant, and the Copp-Dash Inspire Award. We were flown into the range by Paul Claus, midday on April 1st. We spent a few hours setting up our basecamp, and then went for a short ski up-glacier to scope our objective. About twenty minutes out of camp I suddenly broke through a totally-hidden crevasse, and fell approximately 15 meters down, ricocheting off the walls of the crevasse. We had left camp for our leisurely ski with essentially no equipment, so Daniel immediately skied back to camp to fetch a rope, crampons, ice tools, and harnesses. I was able to climb out of the crevasse with a top-rope (and even managed to rescue my skis and poles!), and fortunately I escaped any truly serious injuries. Unfortunately, however, I had a fractured cheek bone, and my trip was over. We skied back to camp, and the next morning I flew off the glacier, for a total of about 16 hours in the St. Elias range! John and Daniel graciously offered to fly out as well and help get me home, but I was confident I'd be alright, so I told them to stay in and go climbing! A couple days later they made an attempt on our objective, Middle Peak, but were turned around up high by really difficult cornices. For those who are interested, I'll include below a more in-depth analysis of my crevasse accident.

So, rather than climbing new routes in Alaska, I spent most of April recuperating in Seattle. For the first week I had a very swollen face, and I was spitting blood for about 10 days. The first two doctors that I talked to, both oral surgeons in private practice, were eager to schedule surgery straight away. Fortunately I got a third opinion from a well-respected doctor at Harborview who strongly advised against surgery. So, I managed to escape the knife and my face feels to have healed up well, with only very subtle changes in symmetry. My smile is a bit crooked now, but I  figure that just makes me look more like a pirate or Fred Beckey!

 

A MORE IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF MY CREVASSE ACCIDENT

This crevasse fall is what I consider to be my fifth close call in the mountains. I'm fortunate to have come away mostly unscathed every time, but if I'm not taking away injuries, hopefully I am at least taking away lessons. Let me start out first with a more detailed account of the accident:

When I broke through the hidden crevasse bridge, in the first instant I actually wasn't worried. For some reason it felt like I was just collapsing a soft spot of snow. However, an instant later, when I realized I was falling a long ways down, I specifically remember thinking, ""Oh, shit. This is serious. This could be really bad."" The fall happened really quickly, and the next thing I knew I was wedged in the bottom of the crevasse, panting. I was pumped full of adrenaline, but I never felt panicked, and with just a quick glimpse upwards, I never had any doubt that I would get out of the crevasse. Since I hit my face against one of the crevasse walls hard enough to fracture my cheek bone, it's quite possible that I briefly blacked out, although it's actually really difficult to tell for sure. I didn't FEEL like I blacked out, but I did seem to suddenly find myself in the bottom of the crevasse, without a specific recollection of exactly how I came to rest. More likely, I think that during the fall my mind went into a pure survival-reaction mode, so that it wasn't recording memories for the second that I was falling. I have some half-memories from the fall, such as that I vaguely recall breaking through some ice, and I vaguely recall the instant of smacking my face against the wall.

I had been skiing with my sleeves rolled up and my gloves off, so my hands and lower arms were covered with scrapes and cuts. Otherwise I felt to be mostly OK, although when I touched my face I could feel already that it was swollen. My nose was running, so I instinctually made a snot-rocket. When I blew my nose I had a bizarre feeling of air being pushed through my eye socket, and then I figured I might have a real injury. I started to spit up blood, and that seemed to confirm my suspicions!

It seemed to be very quick that John caught up, and yelled down to me. I already had a clear idea of how to get out, and I immediately yelled to John that someone needed to go get my crampons, my ice tools, my harness, some slings and 'biners, and a rope. Daniel took off back towards camp to fetch the equipment, and I started working on my situation.

When I broke through the crevasse bridge, my skis had been parallel to the crevasse, and I remained in that orientation during the fall, so that when I came to rest I was facing down the length of the crevasse. I have my approach skis set to generally never release, so one of my skis was still on my foot, while the other ski seemed to have come off right when I stopped, because it was off my boot, but positioned with the binding just below my foot. Most of my weight was on my feet, on my skis, and I think that my skis really helped me not become wedged more tightly. In the position that I was in, I had no chance to put on a harness or crampons because I was wedged too tightly. Above me the crevasse quickly got wider, and about two meters up I saw a sort of saddle/fin of ice that bridged the walls. I figured I needed to climb up to there.

Climbing just two meters up proved to be very difficult. If I had been wearing crampons and with ice tools in my hands, it would have been absolutely dead easy, but climbing up hard, blue glacial ice without that equipment is really, really slippery! Also, extricating myself from my wedged position was not easy, because it was tight enough that I couldn't turn either of my feet around until I got them a couple feet higher. I was lucky that the ice was surprisingly featured, and I managed to climb up to the ice fin with a combination of chimneying, manteling, and crimping little ice edges with my bare, bloody fingers.

When I reached the ice fin I straddled it as if I were horse-back riding, and finally I had a position that was somewhat restful. I had been wearing my small backpack all this time, and finally now I was able to take my gloves and jacket out to put them on. John was even able to chuck his puffy down to me, I was able to catch it, and then I was decently warm. At this point I had about 20-25 minutes of sitting on the ice fin, waiting for Daniel to get back from basecamp with the technical equipment. I guess at this point the adrenaline started to wear off, and I suddenly felt extremely tired and sleepy. I was in a decently restful position, but I would've fallen off the ice fin if I had lost consciousness. I felt that I had to fight to not pass out, by intentionally hyperventilating, and shaking my upper body.

When Daniel got back from his wind-sprint with the technical equipment, I was finally able to properly work on getting out of the crevasse. It took a few tries, but John was able to toss an end of rope that I was able to catch, and then he lowered down my crampons. Even straddling the ice fin was still a really difficult position to move in, and getting my crampons on was difficult, but once they were on my feet it changed everything. With crampons on, even without ice tools, I was very easily able to chimney a couple meters higher, to where there was a small ledge to stand on. From that ledge I had much more room to move, and now I was able to put on my harness that John lowered, followed by my ice tools. At this point, getting out was easy - simply a matter of climbing some AI3 with a tight toprope. I was even able to lower down a bit and retrieve both my skis and poles.

Once back on the surface of the glacier, Daniel gave me a quick examination (he is a fire-fighter, and therefore also paramedic), and then we took off back towards camp, because it was almost dark by now. Back in camp I wondered if I might be able to stay and climb, but it didn't take long to realize that would be a stupid decision. With a fractured bone in my face it didn't make sense to stay in the middle of nowhere, especially considering the weather was then good enough to fly a ski plane, and most of the time it isn't. We were able to get through to Paul Claus by sat phone, and called for him to pick me up in the morning. One thing that I found really surprising is that despite impacting my face so hard to fracture my zygomatic bone (cheek bone) in three places (the three places it attaches to the bones around it), I had only very minor pain, and never experienced any significant pain during the entire healing process. A bit of minor frostbite on my toes a few years ago was vastly more painful!

I come from a backpacking, hiking, and scrambling background mostly in the Olympics and Cascades surrounding Rainier -- meaning I've bagged mostly all of the smaller peaks in the state however, my glacier travel and actual mountaineering skills still need a bit of development.

I went through a basic mountaineering course a few weekends prior (crevasse rescue, working in rope teams, self-arrest etc etc.) and feel quite confident in my skills, nonetheless, I'm headed up to Ellinor this weekend to practice self-arrest a bit more. 

Anywho, I would greatly appreciate if someone who's done the route could let me know what I'm in for. Also, any tips would be great as well. Thanks!

I've hiked several weeks, including the French Pyrenees (Camino de Santiago), so my highest hiking experience is about 1600m. I also have some toprope climbing experience. We both are physically fit.

I understand that activities in higher terrain are very tough. About how much tougher are we talking here, comparing 1600m and 4000m and how much acclimatization is necessary?

So It would be really great if I could get some realistic ideas, of how doable Mont Blanc really is.. From what I've read so far, Mont Blanc can be very dangerous and I really don't want to become part of some death statistic.

Both jobs are kitchen work jobs (I'm 20 and couldn't work out anything more glamorous or more high paying) and they both will work out with me financially with housing and whatnot Each have pros and cons I am evaluating, and what I am asking from you guys is that if you have any more insight or information on either location for living for a summer please let me know!

Mt Rainier: PROS: get to hike/climb around Mt. Rainier, get a free guided summit attempt of Rainier (part of my job's benefits), work essentially next door to the best guiding service in the world (the job is in Ashford)
CONS: limited recreational area versus glacier (i.e. only one mountain peak versus 2 dozen), I won't live and work up on the mountain (Ashford is 25 miles from Paradise), work location isn't very glamorous or exciting

Glacier: PROS: work location is very glamorous and exciting (great views), huge park area to hike and explore, many mountain peaks to summit in a day trip, I can visit Alberta for the first time (not a huge factor but still cool)
CONS: smaller peaks, I won't get the free summit of Rainier, no exposure to ice or snow climbing, no exposure to the best guide service in the world

So really I find myself in a pickle and I have turned to Reddit for guidance like the many others before me.  But seriously I kind of have an idea of what I want to do, but please feel free to give insight and advice if you feel so inclined.

2) I plan on updating the sidebar with some additional information and links. Couple different posts containing local climbing club info, gear shops/links, maybe a partner search.

It is still disputed why the whole group dropped, e.g. were they tied together, or caught in a small slab avalanche? There had been new snow (possibly even on frozen rain), and fog was pulling in when the accident occurred.

The book, for those who haven't read it, details the events leading up to, surrounding and ultimately following the 1967 Wilcox Expedition tragedy. At a time in which only 4 deaths had been previously recorded in Denali's history 12 individuals summited the peak and only 5 of the group made it back down safely.  

Tabor's writing was well researched and borrowed from written accounts of party members, national park service and other experts. In taking the time to interview individuals closely tied to the disaster he offered a pointedly unbiased perspective towards the incident (which had been divisively argued over for decades).

A few friends and I are looking to spend a week (or a little more) climbing in South or Central America this winter.  Our goal is to do this with minimal to no guiding while staying within our abilities.  We're not necessarily looking to do lots of altitude or technical terrain, but I think we'd like to push both of those as hard as is appropriate.

Some background:  I guess we're intermediate climbers.  Last summer we climbed Kili, but that was heavily guided and portered.  We also did Mt. Jefferson this winter (also guided), so we've done a little time carrying packs in crampons, on ropes, self-arresting, etc, though we're definitely not that experienced on technical terrain.   We are fairly experienced rock climbers, and we're all pretty fit.

So, given that, what's our best bet?  I think our per-person budget, including airfare from New England, is around 2 to 3k.  Also we speak enough spanish to survive.

As previously mentioned, i would like to ask your opinions on your flashlights to develop the knowledge centre.

So my question is: **What head torches are you using?**

As i found out in caving, i have no idea what brands are being used in other hobbies, but i would assume they would be able to withstand a good knock around, and the very low temperatures. Also, what types of batteries do you use? (if its an issue at all?)

If you use more than one, please add them all, Perhaps asterisk (*) the best one. I'll tally them all up, i'll work out the prices, then post the most popular models/prices/details in our new exciting knowledge centre to help the new users.

Our goal is to be a big as possible, and help users find a suitable flashlight for all redditors within their budget and requirements. Please feel free to post or pm me here for any feedback you might have for the FAQ :)

Does anyone have any experience with Gannett - or any other place in the Winds - during early October (the 5th to the 13th or so is the range I'm currently considering)? Have you summitted? Have you been snowed on? How hard did it snow? Could you summit anyway? What backups did you consider?

I am looking to get into alpinism; I have done my best to read the previous posts which are similar to this, but was hoping I could get some slightly more tailored information.

For a bit of background, I grew up in SE Australia, in the mountains and my life has always revolved around hiking, however the mountains there do not demand ""alpinism"" as such. I recently moved to Paris and since being here have done as much hiking as I can fit in, but I am really interested in getting higher. I have purchased the seemingly required literature (The Freedom of the Hills) and I am interested in taking a alpine course. So I was wondering if anyone knows a good place to take such a course. I have found places online, but it is hard to figure out what is what, in terms of actually being aimed at someone that wants to learn and climb seriously, not just climb Mont Blanc as a once in a lifetime thing.

I'm wondering how going an additional few thousand feet I am going to react.  Now with Kilimanjaro I have some positives I didn't have on Rainier.  These include less weight I'm carrying to the top, more time on the mountain to acclimatize, and an additional 6 months to prepare my body.  Because of these I assume I will be able to push higher but I'm not quite sure how much higher.

I am very interested in climbing Rainier or some other mountaineering destination and I have more-or-less already made up my mind that I will do something. I'm looking for advice into what would give me the most mountaineering knowledge/experience for a reasonable cost.  
  
So far I'm looking at the 4 or 5 day Rainier summit trip from RMI:  
http://www.rmiguides.com/mt-rainier/4-day-summit-climb/  
  
I have also considered the Yamnuska Intro to Mountianeering course (not too much more costly minus travel to Calgary/Banff, why are flights so much $$$?):  
http://yamnuska.com/mountaineering/beginner-programs/alpine-instruction/  
  
I'm open to other options, such as Mt. Hood or Baker. I'm just looking forward to getting out there and applying all the skills that I've read about.    
  
Some additional info about me:  
-Comfortable with class 3 terrain but mostly climbed sub-12,000'  
-Lead sport up to 5.9 outdoors  
-Gone through Freedom of the Hills many many times  
-Some backing experience, but will work on some cold weather trips  
  
So I'm basically curious as to what you all think about what the best option is. Rainier? Intro School? Or a smaller peak in the NW? I don't have an infinite budget, but I'm ok spoiling myself a little ;)

Use my 2 and 4.5 year old kids as free-weights (I suppose you can say it's actually them using me as an amusement park) to work the back and arms 

Exercise ball:
  
**hamstrings:**  lay on back, heels on top of ball with legs extended, pick up rear and pull legs in rolling ball towards you, rinse repeat    
**arms:**  triceps:  palms on ball behind your back, dip rear down to complete ""push up"", rinse repeat   
**chest, arms**  do push-ups with hands on the ball or hands on the floor/feet on ball  
**core:**  sit on ball and maintain balance without touching floor or objects  

other:  

**plank:** hold body straight and rigid in a push-up position with elbows on ground  
**balance:** hold your balance standing on one leg as long as possible, moving upper body routinely in an effort to keep center of gravity moving, causing your lower legs to have to maintain stability.  slight knee bends/squats help too.  

**misc:**  calf-raises, sit-ups, push-ups, lunges, squats,

I moved to Seattle a while back and have gotten the hiking/outdoors bug for the last year or so. Late last year my friends and I decided we'd make it our goal to summit Mt. Rainier in early July by going on a 3-day guided trip with IMG via the Camp Muir/Disappointment Cleaver route.

In that time, I've been training as much as I can to build my stamina, running up stairs with a pack and going on long runs. I also wanted to be somewhat self-sufficient, so even though it's a guided climb, I've also taken courses in basic rock climbing and will be taking classes in basic/advanced mountaineering and crevasse rescue from IMG this month. I can hike Mt. Si (3,150 ft in 4 miles) with a 35-pound pack without issue and can do Mailbox Peak (4100ft in 3 miles) but I haven't tried it with a super heavy pack (20-25 pounds is probably the heaviest I've done).

Long story short, I think I've done a bunch to prepare but I still have no idea what to expect. I want to maximize how I spend the last month and I'm still pretty nervous. Are there any tips or advice you folks have for me for what I can do over the next month, little things I should remember for the summit attempt, etc.?

Thanks so much!

Now, I'm not talking ice tools here, but what are the thoughts on something like the Petzl Charlet Summit axe? Slight bend and shorter (52-66cm?) than the walking style. 

Thoughts are that something like the Charlet Summit would be more versatile in the long run for use on more technical climbs which don't involve steep ice, lighter, smaller, but still able to get the job done. I'm 6'1"", would a more technical axe like this be a pain in the ass on a climb like Rainier, or would it be worth it in the end for the versatility on more technical climbs?

Money is not much of an issue here, but the complete AAI 36 day course is a pretty penny more than the comparable Yamn. course.

If I can skip buying a piece of gear that is $100 and will be obsolete for me by the end of my first season, I would like to do that.  If it is really necessary to get both, I will seriously consider it.

He apparently could tell that their foot work and swings/sticks were no where near up to that level of lead climbing. I'd love any recommendations for ice climbing videos or literature.

Iâve been working on getting fit but given that I havenât had a real goal in mind it has been slow going. Iâve decided that I need a goal and I think mountaineering should be it given how interesting I find it.
So, my question to all of you fine people is where should I start? Has anyone else been in my position where theyâre out of shape and all they have is the strong desire to do this? If so, what did you do? How did you motivate yourself? How did you learn?

Guided, hand-held tours do not sound fun, but I'm not going to go all [Goran Kropp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6ran_Kropp) anytime soon either.

This fall, I will be in Scotland for a semester and might be able to make a long weekend and climb a Western European peak. I'm considering doing Kilimanjaro after fall term (or maybe Elbrus? though that might be out of my league). Then next spring I'll be back in CA and doing Mt. Whitney. **What do you guys think about these mountains? any suggestions?**

**Where do I learn more about mountaineering, or what should I start with?** I actually want to learn skills so I can do real mountaineering, not just crappy made-for-tourists guided tours. 

**Where are good places to get used or sale gear (don't have any real gear right now)? Any other pointers?** If it helps, I'm in the bay area for the summer.

I will be living in Spain this August and have always wanted to climb Teide because it is stupidly beautiful, but I honestly can't decide whether I can do so safely so I'm wondering if anyone here can offer insight.

From what I've researched people seem to say it can be done in a day, and there is no actual climbing involved, however if one splits it into two days and acclimatizes at the refugio, you may have a better time.

Has anyone here climbed Teide? Would someone who is in decent shape with a basic climbing/hiking background have a reasonable shot at summiting here or should I stay away since this would basically be over 2x higher than anything I've climbed before?

I'm generally very conservative in my climbing opting for safety over glory, but this summer will give me a shot at this peak that I likely won't have again for quite a while and I'd hate to miss it by being overly-cautious.

P.S. I apologize if I've done anything wrong, while I've lurked on Reddit for a while, I am not really a very active contributor and likely suffer from noobism.

Anyway, /r/alpinism, I have some questions:

* Has anyone done the route? Is it good? Anything I should watch out for?
* I've led grade III winter routes in Scotland, and lead VS trad on a good day, but I have zero Alpine experience: is this a reasonable choice for a first Alpine route? I'm a bit worried about the altitude, to be honest, as it's over twice as high as anything I've climbed before.
* I've done a lot of hillwalking and scrambling in Scotland with this guy, often in winter, but never anything very technical (he's done a couple of 4000ers in the Alps, but without me). His devotion to the Alpine ""fast and light"" ethic freaks me out on occasion. For instance, his email says ""You would need to bring a harness and an ice-axe. I will decide later on helmets and crampons."" Is there any good reason *not* to wear crampons on a glacier, in these days of Vibram soles? Or to have an ice-axe out and not be wearing a helmet?

I pursue true alpinist style and take a light and fast approach whenever I can. My question would be is the performance of a Nomic as above and beyond as people tell me? Attaining a hard swing with a lighter tool shouldn't be a problem as I swing a hammer for a living. However if the difference in performance is that significant it no longer matters. Has anyone used both for mixed climbing? To be clear I intend to use these tools for difficult technical climbing, and I plan to supplement their use later on with one of the most aggressive tools on the market the Petzl Ergos.

- First off, anyone have any recommendations for the shuttle situation? The AMC shuttle doesn't operate during the winter and we're coming all of the way from Atlanta and can't bring two cars. I'm not afraid to hitch-hike but are there any other options? And does the road see enough traffic in the winter to make hitch hiking viable?

- Snowshoes. I'm assuming that the snow in NH is pretty wet and frozen in December but I've never been up the east coast in winter so I don't know. I'm a big guy and with a full load I'll probably be 250lbs. Do you think I can get away with something like a 22 inch MSR evo tour snowshoe or would I need to add the tail? I'm kind of inexperienced with the whole snowshoe thing (rented before but that's about it) so any advice would be appreciated.

- I plan on getting weather updates via NOAA broadcasts to an frs radio. How is the reception along the traverse?  I'm assuming you can receive the weather band just fine but I want to make sure...

I'm looking to start a career in the Mountaineering industry as a guide. I've come across the Mountain Guide School (http://mountaineeringtrainingschool.com/mountain-guide-school/) and it seems they have what I'm looking for.

The course is 2 years of full time experience in the field, ranging from Skiing, Mountaineering, Rock Climbing, wilderness first aid and everything in between. I figure it will be a good way for me to get experience and there is a guaranteed job in the field after I'm done (every student they have had so far has gotten a job as a professional guide).

The hard part is the cost. It's a $30,000 course. I'm totally willing to pay this money as trying to make trips over multiple years to get the experience I will on this course would cost a lot more, but I want to know if anyone has any opinions on this sort of thing?

The course offers completion of a number of certificates and awards that are world recognized in the industry and they assure to assist in finding work during the second year (internship/apprenticeship) and after the course.

I have thought about this a lot, spoken with the school many times and have gone over it with a lot of people, friends and family included, but I'm just looking for any opinions or advice from professionals or guides/workers in the industry before I seal the deal and get the ball rolling.

* bottles on the inside of your pack are too much of a faff to get out until the end of the climb,
* Bladder/tube systems freeze, which is solvable by blowing air back up the tube and warming the mouthpiece under your armpit; but they also sometimes leak, which is a less tractable problem,
* I've seen people keep a 0.5L bladder in a chest pocket, but you're a bit screwed if that leaks or bursts.

What do you all do?

I should explain that I'm really interested in Scottish winter climbing, which I guess is probably closer to summer alpinism than winter alpinism in terms of temperatures experienced.

The drive to do this hit me a while ago but it hit me hard. I was in chamonix on a exchange and we visited the aiguille midi. Across from the aiguille midi you can see the summit of mont blanc and in that instant of seeing this massive peak I knew that someday I was going to climb it and all the other bigger mountains of the world. I don't plan on climbing one of the ultras until I am least 20, the first will be mont blanc, and everest is a long way down the road for me (Like a long way).

 I am growing up in whistler BC canada with plenty of mountains surrounding and my next planned trip is Wedge mountain and the spearhead range.
But what I am really saying is are there any helpful tips I can pick up for starting to become an alpinist? (And don't say your too young don't start this because I have a history of alpinism in my family and I am determined)

I am a college student ambitious to learn how to alpine climb. I live in California. I don't have very much money, but I am willing to save up for a worthwhile mountaineering course. 

I am confident that the most well known ones will give me legitimate skills and experience. Unfortunately, they come with a hefty price tag.

Are there any reputable 4-12 day courses that are more budget friendly? I don't know if this is a realistic budget, but I'd like to keep it under $2,000 if possible. Again, I would have to seriously save up for this, which I am willing to do. The lower the cost of the course, the sooner I could take it / the less it hurts me financially.

Thanks for all your help.
