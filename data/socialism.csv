We know the Democrats have sold out, probably from the very beginning. We aren't interested in reforming capitalism. Our interest lies in abolishing it. We'll march together to push for more comprehensive social programs, more investment in infrastructure, more rights for the oppressed...

But our goal is not to make the system better. We think the system is corrupted and degrading to humans. We want to abolish most of what you think is private property. Anyone who owns a steel mill and hires people to work in it shouldn't own it. We believe the workers should own it, and everyone who owns the means of production should be a worker. None of this ""I hire you to do my work and push your wages down so I can maximize my profits"" bullshit.

No. The goal of the Democratic Party is to get elected and try to pass legislation that helps people before caving to corporate interests--those who ultimately get you elected. We think you're, for the most part, spineless liberals.

We think you take our ideas for social justice, ride on the waves, before using it to get yourselves elected. But when we ask you to get arrested, very few of you do. We do the organizing. When we ask you for help, you shy away. You're scared to commit until we get a broader base of supporters. I'm sure you remember saying, at least once, or heard someone say, that your party members are ""uneasy"" around ""such crazies."" That's because you aren't willing to lose what you already have for something better.

And, since you probably already have what you think are ""liberal leaning"" views, you're probably 5 books away from becoming socialists just like we are. So, until then, know that we aren't part of your machine.

No, we don't like JFK. We don't like FDR. We don't like Obama, or Clinton, or Carter, or Johnson. When we study them, we tend to shrug and say ""well, it could have been worse.""

How can they serve the public? How can it be justice?

The same way Wal-Mart serves the public. Private business owners have their customers at heart. The government just cares about getting tax money. They're greedy. They don't offer what people want, and take money and give them what they believe people want. Private businesses on the other hand ask what customers want, and let the customers decide whether to pay and do business, or not and go their separate ways.

**TL;DR**
Big government of officials at the whims of the people are somehow *more greedy* than **Wal-Mart**

Why: American gets over 80% of its oil from within the country from American Oil Companies. The Oil Companies in America have this country by the nuts, or should I say, wallet. They are making record profits, but continue to raise the price, which hurts the Proletariat, or the middle class. In many ways, these oil companies have monopolized themselves, and have gotten their way into our government through the Republicans. There must be something the government can do against this. Nationalization? It's an amazing concept really, and I'll take you step by step.
How: You take the top three Oil Companies, and make them government run. This would make oil extraction paid through taxes, and other funds. And, if the powers be, this would get rid of a middle man, so to speak. Make gasoline free at the pump, (or at a lowered price such as less than a dollar a gallon.)
Benefits: Not only does this lessen the strain on Americans who are in need of transportation, but it also can encourage people to go out and find work. Example: People who do not want to pay a Benjamin to fill up their tank because they have to drive to work everyday. This allows those people to spend that Benjamin on something that will indeed fuel the economy.

I am a PhD student studying media portrayals of Latin America, and I can honestly say, Venezuela may be the most misrepresented country in the press. 

I don't want you to just believe me. I have given you links so you can scrutinize my argument fully. Check up on me. Am I making this stuff up or exaggerating? Every effort has been made to use unimpeachable sources of primary data, such as the World Bank, the United Nations and highly reputable polling organizations like Pew and Latinobarmetro, which is a Chilean polling organization whose work features regularly in the Economist, Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Let's get mythbusting!

**The Accusation** Chavez led a coup. It is often remarked that Chavez led a coup in 1992. Two example is [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/opinion/hugo-chavez-departs.html) New York Times article and [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/key-events-in-hugo-chavezs-rise-to-power-and-presidency-in-venezuela/2013/03/05/8a4dddcc-85e1-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html) Washington Post article. Conveniently, the context of the coup is left out. Despite producing more the $300 billion of oil wealth between 1958-1998, the equivalent of 20 Marshall Plans, the majority of Venezuelans were living in shocking slums. By the 1990s, quality of life indicators for ordinary Caracas residents were  below Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. Between 1970 and 1997, workers' incomes declined by [50%, while poverty doubled between 1984 and 1991](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040274?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101776675521)

President Carlos Andres Perez, on orders from the IMF, increased oil prices for Venezuelans. This led to increases in transport costs, to the point where Caracas residents were spending, on average, 25% of their entire wages on bus fares.  (Jones, B. [“Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362578797&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=hugo+bart+jones) p. 116) Food riots broke out and Perez sent the army in. 3 days of terror ensued. The LA Times, Bart Jones speaks of Red Cross workers being gunned down in the street, “mass graves” being filled with “mutilated corpses”, “tied up corpses” with “bullets in the back of their heads” and children being gunned down as the armies fired indiscriminately into shanty towns. (Jones, B. [Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362578797&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=hugo+bart+jones) pp.121-124) Much of the army leadership was deeply shocked at this. They began to gather around a young Colonel called Hugo Chavez and conspired to rebel against the President. The rebellion of 1992 failed, and Chavez was sentenced to what amounted to a life sentence, yet, the rebellion was so popular with the public that the new president, Rafael Caldera was essentially forced to release Chavez just 2 years later. After getting out he immediately began to organize for a Presidential election.

**Myth: Partially confirmed**

Myth 2- The Venezuelan economy is a shambles. In [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-oil-giants-squeeze-chavez) Guardian article, the author wonder how long the Venezuelan economy can totter on. Figures from the World Bank, hardly a Chavez ally, show a different story. Venezuela's GDP has [more than tripled under Chavez,](http://i.imgur.com/CyeLEvC.jpg) while net national income [has also nearly tripled.](http://i.imgur.com/gKd5YBs.jpg) Meanwhile, both the [United Nations Development Project](http://i.imgur.com/cdaFIOv.jpg) and the [World Bank](http://i.imgur.com/eKaova1.jpg) agree that unemployment has dropped from over 11% to under 8%. When asked themselves, Venezuelans have the [highest confidence in their economy of any Latin American country.](http://i.imgur.com/QtZ7L3x.jpg) Venezuela's external debt has [dropped precipitously.](http://i.imgur.com/rJSNmaS.jpg) Meanwhile, Venezuela's stock market is the [best-performing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/31/venezuela-best-stock-market-2012) in the [world.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/stock-market) You may have heard stupid Chavez is causing massive inflation, [but the facts are the opposite](http://i.imgur.com/uSq7BFY.jpg). One year before Chavez took office, inflation was an eye-watering 103%. It is now in the teens. The high-point inflation under Chavez was lower than the lowest inflation under the previous 2 presidents. 

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Chavez is a dictator**
This one is so ubiquitous I won't give examples. 

Voter turnout in Venezuela in the October 2012 election was above [80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012), higher than any election in US history. Under Chavez, voter turnout in Venezuelan elections has increased by 135% (1998 turnout: [6.3mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998), 2012 turnout:[14.8 mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012). That means almost two and a half times as many people vote nowadays than in the 1990s. The number of registered voter has risen by over 70% under Chavez.

Jimmy carter and the Nobel Peace Prize-Winning Carter Center recently stated [“the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.”](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=8935#.USvSHnMnty4) The European Union Election Observation Mission agreed, saying [“the system developed in Venezuela is probably the most advanced in the world to date”](http://embavenez-uk.org/pdf/fs_democracia.pdf) The number of polling stations has increased by [38% in 10 years.](http://www.cartercenter.org/documents/1151.pdf) One year pre-Chavez, only [11% of Venezuelans](http://i.imgur.com/1JOmBJZ.jpg) believed elections were clean. By 2006, [2/3 believed they were.](http://i.imgur.com/BdT8eFj.jpg) Venezuelans rate their democracy the [second best in Latin America](http://i.imgur.com/MWs264L.gif). Venezuela has by far the most politcal parties in Latin America, and confidence in them is the [highest in the region.](http://i.imgur.com/c7B0Me0.jpg) In 2002, [80%](http://i.imgur.com/6uRqNRB.jpg) of Venezuelans believe their vote influences policy. Venezuelans were asked to rate their democracy from [1-10](http://i.imgur.com/an0pd2n.jpg) How does Chavez do it, it must be because...

**Myth: Chavez Controls the Media** There appears to be an authoritarian dictator crushing freedom of the press in Venezuela. We read about it all the time. How many free outlets are left?

As Mark Weisbrot has shown in an extensive study, the Venezuelan state owns [about 5% of all media outlets.](http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/2010_12_venezuela_media.pdf) Both the [BBC](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19368807) and [Le Monde](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) agree on the 5% figure. In comparison, state owned media accounts for 40 and 37% of British and French television. 9 out of the top 10 selling newspapers in Venezuela are virulent anti-Chavez, and by virulent, Le Monde Diplo calls it [“hate media”](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) while Richard Gott in the Guardian says the largest station, RCTV is a [“white supremacist channel”](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jun/07/comment.venezuela) and JMH Salas reports that they regularly assault him with words like [“sambo, thick-lipped monkey” “ape”](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040277?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101777011571) (Chavez is the first-non white President) In contrast to what we read, Venezuelans believe there's [about as much freedom of speech as there is in Spain](http://i.imgur.com/hD8PQxY.jpg) **Myth: Busted**

**Myth: There are food shortages in Venezuela**

Actually, venezuela has [doubled the amount of cereals it produces](http://i.imgur.com/qPybLCY.jpg) in just 10 years,[as has milk, eggs and pork](http://imgur.com/agUo7ym). Child malnutrition has dropped by [2/3 in 10 years](http://i.imgur.com/OeoP3DQ.jpg), too. So, are there food shortages? Look at this [anti-Chavez blogger's post](http://daniel-venezuela.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/food-shortages-in-venezuela.html) He shows that food shortages mean the most popular mayonnaise is gone, but there are clearly 4 or 5 other brands still available. Again, white sugar is gone but there is plenty of brown left. Only one brand of powdered milk is left. The reason for this is Chavez instituted price-controls and gave people jobs, increasing their purchasing power. This meant for the first time in their lives, ordinary people can afford dairy produce. If you think about the logic behind this, you can find out a lot about how the media see ordinary people. In the 1990s when children were dying from malnutrition, there were no stories of food shortages, but now that rich people like themselves can't find Kraft mayonnaise and have to settle for Hellmans, that is a shortage. **Myth: Busted**

**Myth:** Venezuela is the most dangerous place in the world

There can be no doubt that there are many murders in Venezuela, as this chart of [reported homicides shows.](http://i.imgur.com/0j1zklT.jpg). Those claiming crime was the country's major problem increased from less than [1% in 2001](http://imgur.com/2npBf1b) to [65% in 2010](http://imgur.com/kk2DuUN). And yet, when asked whether they or their family were victims of crime, “yes” dropped from [49% in 2000](http://i.imgur.com/SRufLZk.jpg) to [28% 2010](http://i.imgur.com/3u0luhO.jpg). Your chances of being a victim of crime have dropped by half while your fear of crime has spiked 6500%. 

**Myth: Partially Confirmed**

**Myth Hugo Chavez is anti-semitic**

The entire case for this comes from a quote where Chavez spoke ill of “those who crucified Jesus”. When read in context, it cannot be taken as such. He gave a list of traitors. He mentioned those who doubled-crossed Simon Bolivar, those who crucified Jesus, those who betrayed Che Guevara, etc. [Here's a pic](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5645) of Chavez meeting the leading Rabbi in venezuela. I might add that this is common tactic of the US elite. A New York Times search for [“Nicaragua anti-semitism”](http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/anti-semitism+nicaragua/) shows no hits for 130 years, a slew of stories between 1983-1986, when the left-wing Sandinistas were in charge, then nothing for 25 years.

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Hugo Chavez loves dictators like Saddam and Ahmadinejad .**

Most of the reports of this come from the time when Chavez went on a whistle-stop tour of the oil-producing countries. The day after he met Ahmadinejad, he actually met a dictator with a far worse human rights record. [That person was US-favorite, the King of Saudi Arabia.](http://www.images22.com/pics/04/saudi-arabias-king-abdullah-with-hugo-chavez.jpg) The picture elicited almost no response in the US media whatsoever. Chavez has taken a lead in reinvigorating the OPEC cartel, and his visits were laying the groundwork for an agreed reduction in oil drilling, in order to stabilize prices. 

**Myth: Busted**
**Myth: Chavez is an Isolated, Unpopular Leader**

Chavez was the first President of the [Pink Tide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_tide), who see themselves as left-leaning, anti-imperialist politicians. President Lula of Brazil openly backed Chavez, saying [""A victory for Chávez is not just a victory for the people of Venezuela but also a victory for all the people of Latin America … this victory will strike another blow against imperialism.""](www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/why-us-dcemonises-venezuelas-democracy). President Correa of Ecuador has called Chavez “a guiding light”( Jones, B. “Hugo” p.420) [Here's a pic](http://paginadoenock.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kirchner-Evo-Lula-Chavez.jpg) of the Presidents of Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina with Chavez, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/iaubmdb.jpg) what the Argentine public think of him. When asked which country they admired the most, Latin Americans chose [Venezuela by a considerable margin.](http://i.imgur.com/nOaLC5T.png)

**Myth: Busted**

**Bonus Myth: The People are worse off under Chavez**

Chavez instituted a national healthcare system which had performed 225 million consultations by 2007 alone. (Cannon, B.  Hugo Chavez and the Bolivarian Revolution, p. 93) The number of public doctors has increased by 1200%, from 1628 to 19571 by 2007. 50,000 Venezuelans were given free operations to restore their sight, between 1 and 1.5 million were taught to read for the first time (Jones p. 8) Health expenditure per person [has tripled](http://i.imgur.com/PriJgse.jpg) According to the Gini coefficient, venezuela went from the most unequal country in Latin America to the most equal. An AC Nielsen/Datos report showed that, from 2004-2006, [97.6% of the population grew in income.](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2794)

Venezuela is one of the most vibrant democracies on Earth, yet the media is representing it as a hellhole. Why is this? [Many](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2013/01/201312912275351687.html) have [wondered](http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/hugo-chavez-proves-you-can-lead-a-progressive-popular-government-that-says-no-to-neoliberalism-8202738.html) Some say it can be explained with [Chomsky and Hermann's Propaganda Model](http://southoftheborderdoc.com/media-distortions-in-latin-america/)

For me, I think it is because they're scared. Of you.  They're scared if people in America knew the truth about what can be achieved in a small country, there would be a dramatic change in American politics overnight. 


Venezuela is certainly not an ideal society by any means, and I'm not even much of a Chavez supporter, but it saddens me to see so many derogatory remarks made about someone who spearheaded change which the vast majority wanted. It also clouds real debate over his failings, as people like me are forced to spend their time correcting and replying to nonsense accusations.

It's called ""American Irony""- how Americans already love democracy &amp; hate tyranny, yet tolerate a tyrannical &amp; dictator-style economic system.

*In their hearts,* many of these people are socialists, but they've been indoctrinated with myths, like how  ""capitalism is democratic.""

Many simply haven't realized that's a myth- yet.   Once they do- once they realize ""capitalism"" is the *limit* to their (loved) democracy, they'll be more open-minded to socialism.

Eg, when conservatives rant about industry's ""private property"" rights, tell them this:

The tyranny of ""private property"" should be limited to yourself- not things other people need.  Not the land they live on, &amp; not the businesses they need.  (That's parasitic.)

Even worse when they talk about how they 'put thier life on the line' like its our fault they made shit decisions in life and ended up having no where to go back the military.
They have the least class consciousness of any section of society, and don't seem to realise their ""shit treatment"" is because at the end of the day they're just working class watch dogs for the bourgeoisie.

Honestly, I can respect private contractors or what not who fight purely for profit, and self interest. But the military has some seriously brain washed and deluded people with an honourable thief complex.

edit:
To the people comparing the military with the revolutionary militia, oh please... the military blindly follows the orders of the man with the most stars on his shoulders, while the revolutionary militia volunteered to unite against tyranny for their freedom. The military is more comparable with the redcoats that the revolutionary militia fought AGAINST

while I do admit that my original post was a tad too emotional/frustrated, the nationalism that reeks from some of these pro military responses make we wonder if some have mistaken the Socialist subreddit for National Socialist 

 the problem with the military is basically like this

1. The top brass says jump, soldiers ask how high - like a king to its subject

2. This unquestioning loyalty is not even seen as a ""necessary evil"", in fact people seem to celebrate this authoritarianism

3. The military is waging a war between the working class, ie when an American soldiers shot an Iraq soldier, he gets a medal, but the same happens on the street he gets 20 years in prison. In both cases a member of the proletariat killed another, the only difference is in the first one he killed someone in the interests of the bourgeoisie.

4. It doesn't have to be this way, if people saw themselves as WORKING CLASS not AMERICAN or IRAQI, then the military would obsolete, for as a class we all share the same interests

5. To top it all not only does the military perpertrate the tyranny of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat, it celebrates itself as the defender of the proletariat's freedom in the most foul hypocrisy. It demands respect/gratitude from those who it helps the bourgeosie enslave.

I noticed that the ""readers"" number in the sidebar seemed unusually high, so I found a [cached webpage](http://s272568090.onlinehome.us/reddit/subreddits-page-1.html) of subreddit readership from November 2010. We used to have only 7377 subscribers less than a year ago. Now we have 12,236, which is right around what r/Anarchism had last year. Considering that many of us are probably subscribers of r/Anarchism also (including me), or may have come to the ideology though that, I think this is pretty awesome.

Anarchism is still the largest of the radical left subreddits (~19,000 as of today), but r/socialism is growing faster and has avoided fragmentation. I've seen the effects of these numbers in the greater quality and quantity of the comments and submissions in the past few months. Like a true socialist community, r/socialism is growing into a large forum where lefties of a wide range of traditions can engage in knowledgable and well...spirited discourse.

Keep it up, comrades.

&gt; Yes, you are right: the law forbids theft.

&gt;If I should steal something from you, you can call a policeman and have me arrested. The law will punish the thief, and the government will return to you the stolen property, if possible, because the law forbids stealing. It says that no one has a right to take anything from you without your consent.

&gt;But your employer takes from you what you produce. The whole wealth produced by labor is taken by the capitalists and kept by them as their property.

&gt;The law says that your employer does not steal anything from you, because it is done with your consent. You have agreed to work for your boss for certain pay, he to have all that you produce. Because you consented to it, the law says that he does not steal anything from you.

&gt;But did you really consent?

&gt;When the highwayman holds his gun to your head, you turn your valuables over to him. You ‘consent’ all right, but you do so because you cannot help yourself, because you are compelled by his gun.

&gt;Are you not compelled to work for an employer? Your need compels you, just as the highwayman’s gun. You must live, and so must your wife and children. You can’t work for yourself, under the capitalist industrial system you must work for an employer. The factories, machinery, and tools belong to the employing class, so you must hire yourself out to that class in order to work and live. Whatever you work at, whoever your employer may be, it always comes to the same: you must work for him. You can’t help yourself You are compelled.

&gt;In this way the whole working class is compelled to work for the capitalist class. In this manner the workers are compelled to give up all the wealth they produce. The employers keep that wealth as their profit, while the worker gets only a wage, just enough to live on, so he can go on producing more wealth for his employer. Is that not cheating, robbery?

&gt;The law says it is a ‘free agreement’. Just as well might the highwayman say that you ‘agreed’ to give up your valuables. The only difference is that the highwayman’s way is called stealing and robbery, and is forbidden by law. While the capitalist way is called business, industry, profit making, and is protected by law.

&gt;But whether it is done in the highwayman’s way or in the capitalist way, you know that you are robbed.

&gt;The whole capitalist system rests on such robbery.

&gt;The whole system of law and government upholds and justifies this robbery.",,False,self,t5_2qjii,False,,,True,t3_17c861,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/17c861/is_capitalism_voluntary_no/,

Every day, I am paid to be a capitalist and I do so with a moral code that has allowed me to be both successful and content with my career.  However, my coworkers are very aware that my socioeconomic views kick back in the moment I'm off the clock.  It's a delicate balance, but even my corporate management team is fairly aware of my socialist views.  

We have a work forum dedicated to discussing politics and how they affect us as individuals and a company (very forward-thinking company) and my avatar is the SP-USA logo, much to the chagrin of the Fox-educated types who think that means I want to steal all their middle class money and give it to fat liberals who never plan to work again as long as we have fine upstanding middle class conservatives to drive into the ground.  The conversations have been... interesting, but they haven't hurt my career.

I'm from Appalachia.  My parents are die-hard Glenn Beck fans and have reluctantly accepted my socialist mindset with such statements as ""it's just so weird because you have a job, why would you want to give all your money away to lazy people that refuse to work?"" and ""when you were growing up, you seemed to care about others a lot more.""

Point being, with the stigma around this word that has developed since Reagan (or existed since the Red Scare, even) and blown up in the past three years going into the last presidential election, how do you respond to questions of politics and socioeconomics?  Do you try or find that it's not worth it?  Have you been discriminated against by coworkers and/or managers for it?  Have you lost friendships?

We get it. You're different. So go be different in your own subreddit. I highly doubt women feel less safe here than they do hanging out with you psychos.

To socialists: if you think feminism is a central part of socialism, that's fine. I do, too. But understand that we can't just ban everybody who doesn't share this view. That's not an effective way of dealing with the issue. We try to have a semblance of pluralism here. This isn't /r/feminisms, it's /r/socialism. I asked the /r/feminisms mods if they would disallow capitalist rhetoric in favor of socialists and they said no; that they seek to include all feminists, including capitalist feminists. Why should we be any different? Is that really in the interest of socialism? I don't like being surrounded by capitalists, but I'm not going to shame and berate the /r/feminisms mods for including them. They're only doing what they feel is in the interest of feminism as a whole. If you shame and berate us, but you don't shame and berate them, then you're just a big fucking hypocrite. Either that, or you don't think capitalist oppression is significant.

This subreddit is about socialism and socialism only. You can talk about other things. That's fine. If you have philosophical disagreements with somebody, you're going to just have to learn to deal with being offended. It's okay. In the words of Steve Hughes, nothing happens when you're offended. It's not going to give you leprosy. Just grow up and be an adult.

I consider myself a feminist, but that's not really relevant here. I'm here to talk about economics and the furtherance of socialism. I want all people to be liberated by socialism. Women are safe here. We ban people who express misogyny, but I don't think saying that you're not a feminist is saying that you're a misogynist.

1322768778.0,119,self.socialism,mwhmc,My life as a manager for one of the world's biggest corporations: FedEx Ground.,ryan_meets_wall,133,14,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/mwhmc/my_life_as_a_manager_for_one_of_the_worlds/,"So it is 2 30 PM here on the East coast, and Im sitting in a computer lab at school reading some posts on reddit. In about twenty minutes, I am leaving to go to work. Where do I work? at FedEx Ground as a manager. Here is the thing about my company; its massive and makes billions of dollars every year. It ships all over the planet. Yes, it does some good things, like sending food aid around the globe in times of crisis. 

When I first started my job over 2 years ago, it was the hardest job I ever had. I loaded delivery trucks. The job ran from 2 30 AM to about 7, five days a week, 6 during Christmas season. I hated it for a while, but I got quite good at it and began to enjoy my job. I was being paid ten dollars an hour plus a 1 dollar bonus for showing up every day. That is how hard this job is. People come in and leave after a few hours because they realize they aren't being paid nearly enough to do this job. But I digress. I enjoyed my job, and I was good at it. I eventually switched shifts, and spent time loading ""pups"" small trailers that are loaded front to back. I got so good at my job, in fact, I applied for a promotion and became a manager. 

Before I became a manager, the other people I worked with liked me. We got along and I made a lot of friends. After I got promoted, they all hate me. And I am going to say why. 

FedEx Ground has certain minimum standards that are required to be met, like anyone else. For example, on the shift I work on, people who load trucks are expected to load 400 packages an hour. The size, weight and all of that do not matter. 400 an hour, minimum, for just ten dollars an hour. Now, factor in that you cannot damage the packages, you must pack the entire truck and make it neat, and you must do this ALL night, well you have a recipe for slavery more or less. 

That used to be me. Now, I stand around and tell other people what to do. I tell my former co workers and friends they must do this, or they can leave (and though this is not said explicitly, its acknowledged implicitly, starve). They know I know how impossible this job is. because I have been there. It does not matter. All the meanwhile, I am expected to not help as much as possible, to handle as few packages as possible. Because after all, I just ""manage"". So, the end result is that people who are working another job or going to school, who are human beings with feelings, end up working their asses off for nothing. The only thing they get is a handful of paid vacation days and health benefits that are taken out of their paychecks, which by the way are too expensive to use on their wages for the most part. if they miss a day, no matter what the excuse (excluding sickness with a doctor's note or family death) they get a write up, and three in a month and they are fired. 

All the meanwhile people who do not even TOUCH a package are making huge amounts of money off these people. The worst part is FedEx is anti-union. 

I hate that I have this job now. I had no idea it would be like this. My boss always tells me the package handler's world is tiny, they're only good if they work, some of them are scumbags, etc. I hate it. And I have a son on the way, and every day I know one day he will have to work at a job that makes him feel like he is worthless. And I hate it. 

I am an anarcho-socialist. and every day I have to against what I know to be true as a socialist. I am coming to hate myself for it, but I have to survive. And I feel for my coworkers every day. I know they hate it. But what can they do? People talk to me about FedEx and how great it must be, and I just scoff. I do not really know why I am writing this, but it has been building. If FedEx is a measure of how great capitalism is, and capitalism a gauge on human advancement, then we have gotten nowhere in the last 300 years. I am just exhausted with this illusion, and needed to share it.

This small landlocked country has changed rapidly since 1990. It was then that the feudal monarchy first allowed a constitutional monarchy, and as workers got to experience a voice in the government Nepal couldn't keep a stable government and in 2008 the Maoist Party won, with further gains since.

Since then Nepal is growing leaps and bounds with the rights of economic health of its people. Yes it is not a paradise and is still pretty unstable, but this was a country that was still a dictatorship 23 years ago. Some improvements not mentioned in the headline:

* Nepal is a secular democracy
* Full citizenship for indivudals who consider themselves 3rd gender (not perfect, but better than most western countries)
* Abolished Haliya, a system of enslavement for ~20,000 bonded workers. 
* Life expectancy at 5 is higher that the rest of south Asia
* Inflation is reduced to 7%
* real GDP growth of 3.8% , which I find crazy in such unstable state
* Literacy has increased from 54% to 65.9% since 2011
* The country's GINI coefficient has fallen from 41 to 35 between 03 and 2011
* Nepal gets only 0.1% of its GDP from foreign investment- average of similar counties is 1.9%
* Decline in stunted/wasted/underwieght children under 5 since 2007
* Primary enrollment has jumped from 74% in 95 to 90% in 09.
* The Community Forestry Program, started in the 70s, which radically conserves Nepal's forest. These woodlands are controlled by their local communities and provide food to subsistence farmers.


Nepal is a resource poor country with no ocean ports and is hemmed in by authoritarian  China to the east and a right-wing India to the east. It has a long way to go- in health, in electrification, in education. Who knows how stable the new government will be. But I think this under-reported country is on the road to becoming a healthy republic. Any thoughts, anyone with personal experience?

There was a point in my life when I began to rethink everything I had been taught. I had finally reached a point at which I had an open mind, despite my surroundings telling me to do the opposite. It was easily one of the most important times of my life. I was finally able to reach my own conclusions about everything, without regarding everyone else's opinion. I began to think about the way we live our lives through religion, politics, and traditions. I began to question those things, and through that I was able to make *my* *own* opinions about our small little world.

When I decided I was a socialist, I came to that position on my own terms. I only realized I was a socialist after I had come to the conclusion that we should all be equal, and that it seems as if most of our problems stem from too few people holding too much wealth and making too many decisions for us as a whole. It is not a difficult position to reach, and seems like a very logical one in my mind. It seems that my problem now is understanding how so many people come to the exact opposite conclusion. I don't understand how they can view the way in which this country runs, and then say that system is not flawed. Something in my mind does not compute this reasoning. Is it because they have never actually taken the time to think about it(and let someone else do the thinking for them), or do they refuse to acknowledge what is actually happening in their surroundings?

So I ask you r/socialism, what is their reasoning? Again sorry if this is a common subject.

Every so often I will get struck in the head by an idea that points to the only logical conclusion that unrestrained profit-motive (or America's version of capitalism) is quite possibly one of the most dangerous things for human progress. I'm not a policy-type per se, so most of my points are just logical, not necessarily pragmatic. It comes in one example at time: 

1) Healthcare: It seems to me that if profit is guiding the health care industry then they have a motivation to keep people sick. This doesn't just mean that they want to keep you sick, but it means that they also have an incentive to continue creating and making up diseases then launching massive PR campaigns telling you you're sick: ""Do you feel tired sometimes? --then you're showing symptoms of depression.""  Shit like that. 

2) Bad products that break and require replacement after X number of years. 

3) The list goes on and on. I mean these ""thoughts"" only come in flashes throughout the day, but they all point to the same conclusion that some person somewhere said once, ""The greater profit and the greater good are inherently, definitionally diametrically opposed.""

What is it about communism, that makes people hate it so?

I know the traditional explanation is to point at Russia or China, and other dictatorships, where the people were oppressed.
But there has to be more to it than that.

Cuba is often mentioned as some terrible communist state, but from what I've heard and read, it's not _that_ bad.
You can't speak up against the government, but they do have excellent schools and a health care program.

ABB from Norway even explicitly mentions marxism, which to my knowledge is basically about how the worker, should be equal to the factoryworker. And that violent revolution might be needed to make that change.


I find it very difficult to understand, how and why, an ideology, that basically says: we're all equal, and therefore the government should own all assets, and pay us equally, can create such fear and hatred.

How ingenious to meet the demands of blacks and women for equality by giving them small special benefits, and setting them in competition with everyone else for jobs made scares by an irrational, wasteful system. How wise to turn the fear and anger of the majority toward a class of criminals bred - by economic inequity - faster than they can be put away, deflecting attention from the huge thefts of national resources carried out within the law by men in executive offices.

I now realize this statement was completely untrue, and the belief is contrary to that of socialism. I will, however stick to my original statement that racism is not nearly as popular of an idea as was, say, 50 years ago. Though it still exists, it is somewhat smaller in number than it used to be, and I consider that a step in the right direction. 
Anyway, I hope this clarification clears things up. I love all my comrades at /r/socialism, and I realize my comments were unwarranted, ignorant statements. 
Edit for further clarification: When I say that racism is lessening, I mean the bigoted belief held by an individual their race is better than any other one, NOT the systematic oppression of non-white people. It is still alive and flourishing, yes, but I see a huge difference in the number of racists in the younger generations than than the older ones.

Dear comrade,

Larisa Boyar, a prominent activist of the Kazakhstan Socialist Movement, and two others - Baxatjan Torevozhina and Kanat Ibragimov - have been arrested and imprisoned. In the morning on 28 April, as protest demonstrations were due to begin, these 'Dissenters' were grabbed by police directly from their homes. By 7.30 in the evening they had been sentenced to 15 days' immediate detention.

**We urgently need protest emails and letters to be sent to the embassy in Britain and to Kazakhstan. Details of where to send them are at the end of this email. Also attached is a Campaign Kazakhstan petition which could be used on May Day protests. Finally we will be organising a lobby of the Kazakhstan embassy in London on Wednesday 2 May at 9 am. Please attend if you can.**

At the 'trial', the prosecution used a video of a press conference given on  April 24, where Larissa had called all active and concerned citizens to fight together with the Kazakhstan Socialist Movement at the week-end.

This court decision is politically motivated and is yet again evidence of the authorities' persecution of oppositionists for their beliefs.

At the demonstration there had been about 40 people who came from Shymkent. They had  been there to highlight the problems of people being harassed by banks over the loans they had taken for homes. Guests of the 'Dissenters' also included workers from the corporation, ""Kazakhmys"", who are currently conducting an active battle over their union.

Over the past week, the Kazakhstan Socialist Movement and the homes campaigners of the 'ONJ' (Leave the People's Homes Alone) have had huge pressure put on them in the run-up to the protest demonstration. They were not able to talk to each other on the phone and relatives were intimidated with the threat of being sacked from their work.

The most active members of Socialist Movement have had criminal proceedings initiated against them with fines imposed of up to 300,000 tenge (around $2,000). Leaders of the Socialist Movement and of the Trade Union, ""Zhanartu"" - Ainur Kurmanov and Esenbek Ukteshbaev – have been pursued by the authorities of Kazakhstan and have had to go abroad.

Thanks to the international solidarity of socialists, with the active participation of Ainur and Esenbek, numerous protests have been organised around the world in the form of pickets and rallies at embassies. The unjust actions of the authorities of Kazakhstan against workers and activists have been roundly condemned. A massive campaign is now needed in support of the organisers of the 'Dissenters'' demonstrations.

**Release Larissa Boyar and the activists of the SMK!**

**Drop all charges and stop harassment of the 'Dissenters'**


Yours in solidarity,

Hannah Sell

Socialist Party (CWI England &amp; Wales)

First of all, I'm quite new into socialism. I have always aimed to follow an ideology that is the most humane and loving. I've been critical against every ideology (including socialism) since I was a little boy to build my own view on what my heart and brain tells me is right.

This past year Socialism has really grown into me and I'm really sure that it is the best ideology there is.

But I don't know much about ""real socialism"", for me socialism is all about caring about thy neighbor, helping the poor and to end poverty. To build a social security for every man and to give roof and food to those who need it and not to feed those who are already rich and hungry more than they need.

You may have another view on socialism and that's why I ask you guys to educate me about what socialism means to you, the importance about it and tell me why you are a socialist.


***The ""real"" text***

In Sweden socialism is getting more rare for everyday and for me who has grown up in a safe, middle class home it's way more common for me to meet conservative moderates. People tend to stare at you like you are a retard if you tell them that you vote for the ""Social Democratic Party"". The main reasons for why they think I'm a retard is:

""You want to raise taxes to steal our money""

""You support censorship""

""You support the soviet dictatorship you fuckwad""

And those two last quotes are those who makes me mad.

I will tell you a story about how socialism got big in Sweden, this is how I learned about how Sweden went from a poor country to one of the worlds most advanced and safe countries.

In the early 1930's a bunch of workers on a factory in northern Sweden decided to demonstrate together against the continuing wage cuts. At this time, Sweden had had a conservative government for over 30 years, the conservatives mainly consisted of noblemen and very rich people.

6000 workers went demonstrating together against the wage cuts. The only answer they got back was bullets, 5 men died and many people became injured.

[Read more about the ""Ådalen Shootings"" here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85dalen_shootings)

This event caused a great political debate in Sweden and The Social Democrats got an extremely high level of trust by the Swedish people, resulting in that the Social Democrats won almost every democratic election for 70 years.

My question is: Why do moderates call us ""communists that supports censorirship"" when the whole ideology mainly is all about the little mans right to demonstrate, to show his discontent over his work situation. The moderates ordered (from what I have learned, may be wrong) the military to shoot on command. Shouldn't I be able to accuse moderates for supporting censorship?

The whole Social Democratic Party got support by standing up for the little man's right to use his voice and demonstrate.


One thing more, why the fuck do I get accused of supporting the Soviet dicatorship when I'm a democratic Socialist, supporting the right to vote for which party you think is the right?

George Orwell is a great inspiration for me. Many moderates in Sweden constantly call the Social Democrats for causing the ""1984""-society. They love the book ""1984"", yet it is written by George Orwell, a democratic socialist.


**TL;DR Moderates murders the Swedish working class and accuse Socialists to support censorship, then quotes ""1984"".**


I want to learn more about socialism, Sweden is for me a great example that Socialism really works, we went from poor to the most healthy land in the world because of Socialism, now the moderates are tearing down this society, making everything more superficial and selfish.

Have you ever been accused for supporting Soviet just because you are a socialist? Whats your answer to them?

Do you agree with what I'm trying to say or am I completely lost? (Wouldn't surprise me, it's hard to argue for something when your English is rubbish and you are new into socialism).

Please have indulgence of my bad English (not even sure if that line is right..), I'm trying my best.

And please, teach me more about Socialism, correct me where I'm wrong and help me develop my thoughts!

Have a good day, friends.

Orwell was a socialist novelist, journalist, essayist, adventurer, broadcaster, compulsive smoker, and interrogator of power. He is best remembered for his dystopian novels, Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four, taught for generations as powerful excoriations of the sinister idea that the inequities could ever be challenged through a revolution of the working class.





What these accounts leave out is the small detail that Orwell himself was a committed socialist who wrote not to decry revolution, but to warn against its corruption – a message all the more powerful for the knowledge that Orwell had experienced such a betrayal of revolution. He was a volunteer soldier in the Spanish Civil War (1936-9), where the revolutionary forces were destroyed from within by Stalinist reactionaries who draped themselves in the rhetoric of radical change.
