EDIT: Wow, this kind of, exploded. A lot of people seem to be misunderstanding my view on this, so I'll explain:

The title was sarcasm. I think discrimination, negative or positive, is at best detrimental and at worst despicable. As such, my problem with this news is that the bank gave their reason for adding Jane Austen to the new set as them needing to have a woman, rather than because they believed her contributions to be great enough.

My other gripe is that I personally believe Jane Austen to be a bad choice. This is not because I believe her contribution to be inferior to anyone elses' but because she is already widely famous. I remember when I first noticed Elizabeth Fry on a fiver and it compelled me to find out who she was. I believe that there are many great people, several of which have been mentioned here, that are much more in need of the unique recognition that this brings, and I feel that including Ms. Austen, who is already a household name, is wasting an opportunity to celebrate someone whose contributions would otherwise go unnoticed.
