1322940080.0,1131,self.teaching,myxtw,"I taught my students the real definition of ""Fair"" and my world has CHANGED!!!",jbooten,1469,338,264,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/myxtw/i_taught_my_students_the_real_definition_of_fair/,"I am a first year Teach For America teacher in the Midwest. I teach 5th grade language arts at a mastery based, college prep middle school in its inaugural year. Life is very interesting.

Our student population (40 5th graders and 45 6th graders) is quite diverse. They have come from over 30 different schools in our area, all for very different reasons - bullying, far behind in achievement, far ahead in achievement, behavior issues, etc. Our population is 88% free and reduced lunch, and 70/30 ratioed black/white.

In my classes, I have functionally illiterate children, children reading at a high school level, and children everywhere in between.  This means that I have a LOT of differentiating to do - and this has created a divide amongst many of my students.  ""Ms. B!!"" they scream at me when I'm explaining homework, ""Why did Timmy get half a page of homework, and I got 2 FULL pages? That's just not fair!!!!""

I hit a breaking point at the beginning of last week, and finally scrapped my vocab words for Tuesday in order to teach the meaning of the word fair.

""Who can tell me what fair means?""
""It means treating everyone the same.""
""WRONG! You've just given me the definition of the word 'equal.' What does 'fair' mean?""
""We.... Don't know?""
""So then why do you say it to me ALL OF THE TIME?""

We then had a LONG discussion about fair meaning ""everyone gets what they need."" I explained that if the cafeteria was serving Peanut butter treating someone with a peanut allergy EQUALLY would mean that they would either eat the peanut butter and get sick or not eat that day, and that treating them FAIRLY would mean providing them with a cheese sandwich so that they could eat lunch too. I then took a class poll, letting everyone see each others strengths and weaknesses.  ""what if I made everyone write 5 paragraphs every night for homework? How many of you would be very frustrated with that because it would be kind of tough for you?"" when about half the class raised their hand, it finally dawned on the other half - ""oh, we all have strengths and weaknesses."" One of the higher leveled readers said ""Oh yeah, Ms. B. that would be like if I had to do all the math homework. It takes me forever because it's really hard!""

My classroom has TURNED AROUND. My students want to help each other now. Lower leveled students want to work harder to prove they can do all of the homework, and higher leveled students are reinforcing their skills by helping the lower kids out.  My life is THAT MUCH EASIER!

**Tl;dr I taught my students the correct definition of ""fair"" and my classroom culture has never been better!**

Awesomeness ensued.,billypilgrim08,106,7,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/omrfh/told_my_7th_graders_about_sopapipa_today/,"So in the spirit of the day, I put the ""This image has been found in violation of SOPA"" picture as the background on my Smartboard.  During 2nd hour, a couple students asked what was wrong with my board.  I explained to them the basic gist of SOPA/PIPA, told them to check out google and reddit and get some more information on it.  I didn't really think it would go anywhere.  7th graders are fickle with their attention.

But holy shit it exploded.

Most of my 2nd hour class sent emails to Congress, including one student who said, ""We recently celebrated Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.  He was a man who fought for freedom.  We need to do the same now.""  While I know he was being overly dramatic, he still struck a chord.  The whole class applauded him when he read it.

Each class period I had after that wanted to do nothing but talk about freedom of speech, the necessary evils of such freedom (i.e. piracy), and by the end of the day, probably 90% of my students had sent emails or signed the petition against SOPA/PIPA.

So yeah, this was one of those good teaching days.

TL;DR:  Told my students about SOPA; they got all a-furious, sent some emails, and made me proud.

I teach 9th grade Geography. Today I decided to use a Socratic Seminar/Inner-Outer Circle discussion activity with my classes. To briefly sum the activity up, you put the desks in 2 circles. Each circle should have an equal number of desks. The kids in the inner circle discuss the topic of the day for 15 minutes, with a student moderator (chosen by the kids) who keeps everyone on track and makes sure speaking time is balanced. The kids in the outer circle  cannot speak at all, they have to write what they want to say when it's their turn to talk and they must chart what the person in front of them is doing (number of times they spoke, asked a question, etc.) After 15 minutes or so, the circles switch and the discussion continues with a new student moderator. There are a number of variations to this activity, this is just how I do it. 

Last class period they read an article about the characteristics, benefits and disadvantages of globalization. Today they had to write some higher level thinking discussion questions about the issue. Then the actual discussion started. I was surprised with how little I had to interfere. The kids nominate a student moderator who basically ran the whole thing. They talked about whether or not cultures should continue to mix, if developed countries should increase or decrease aid to developing countries, what they would do about outsourcing, etc. It was awesome to see kids who don't normally talk in class actually get involved in the conversation. Very few kids were rude or disrespectful. The discussions were thought provoking and at the end the kids were disappointed that we didn't have more time in the class period to keep  talking. Some even asked ""Can we do this again? I really liked it."" 

Days like this are why I love teaching. And it's a Friday to boot!!

And you are sick of it.
And you are seriously thinking about leaving, you just don't want to be a teacher anymore.

I feel your pain.
I cannot know your individual trials and tribulations. Every classroom, every class is unique. I teach English in Los Angeles; not in the heart of 'the ghetto' but in East L.A. We have our problems; to put it in perspective, I think 83% of our kids qualify for free lunch and breakfast programs, an indicator of severe poverty. I am no expert and you can take my words with several containers of grains of salt. 
What I want to say to you is this:
A lot of you (student teachers) have **shite** mentors; they take the extra $500 a year to be a 'mentor', then they sit in your room, nod slowly while you cry, then fucking walk away, shaking their heads. Some are good, but mine (both of them) did it for the money plain and simple. They did more harm than good with me. What can you learn from this? 

Two things: first, DOCUMENT EVERYTHING THAT LAZY SACK OF SHIT TELLS YOU. They come in for their weekly 'mentoring session'? You freakin' sit there, bushy-tailed and taking verbatim notes. VERBATIM; they cough, they fart, you write that down. Try recording them. Set up a video camera on a tripod and put THAT in their face.

Second, FIND THE PERSON WHO SHOULD BE MENTORING YOU. Find the old lonely guy in your department, the shop teacher who never has to call Security, the mousy little Spanish teacher whose students throw a birthday party for her like she's their mother. Then, FIND OUT WHAT THEY LIKE AND GIVE IT TO THEM. While they eat, drink or smoke it, LISTEN. The guy I learned from loved cigars. I bought them, we smoked them and I listened. Eleven years later, here I am, still breathing and everything.

Some of you have problems keeping up with the grading. You have to grade 200, 300 writing assignments a week, no time for exercise, no time for sexy, just grade grade grade.


**Why would you do that?**


Seriously, do you think that sheer output is the secret to improvement?
Think about this and if it'll get you in trouble, forget I said anything, okay? 

But 
right now, just CONSIDER...cutting the number of assignments in half.
 
**Half.**

Slow the hell down. Act like a pot-smoker; savor the good assignments and throw them up on the projector, 'oh, everyone look at what Bernice did with her sentence structure, see how she varied her subjects?' Talk about the best and the worst (without rancor!) and adjust what they're doing. Their basic skills are bad, their fundamentals suck? 
How is that your fault?
Hey, their parents sent you the best kids they had. If the parents hadn't spent years sloughing off their duties and had been good parents, their kids would be reading and writing at grade level. Are they? No? Huh. Well, whose fault is that? 
And yeah, you're the one who has to do something about it- and you CAN and you WILL do something about it. Those kids are going to improve! Unless they aggressively try to reject or stop what you're doing (and we'll get to that next time), they are going to improve.
You can make their lives better AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORK YOURSELF TO DEATH DOING IT.

One day during a music theory class I was having students read aloud from the textbook *very selected* paragraphs.  I'd **never** have them read through a chapter, but instead read like 3 lines and then I'd stop them and *fill in gaps*/*connect* to what they know/ask *question*s/ask for *interpret*ation/ask for questions, etc.  I'd try and be as **exciting** as possible.  But so many of them struggled with reading, even as high schoolers.  I couldn't tell if it was trouble reading some of the words, stage fright, fumbles of the tongue, or just being shy.  I was getting bored and it was bringing ^down ^^my ^^^energy, and something had to be done.

So the next day during class I started normally to see if they just had an off day.  Nope, these kids were awful at this reading stuff.  You could tell they got very little out of the actual reading and weren't remembering anything from the day before.

So I stopped this guy and said ""Read the paragraph to yourself.  Everyone just hang on a sec. Read it too if you all want.  Good? Ready? Okay. Now **SAY IT LIKE A PIRATE.  ACT**.

This got a few ""Mr. Trombone are you off your rocker"" type remarks and giggles, but I insisted.

This is the greatest idea I ever had.  Don't read things.  ACT.  The fact that they had to read, interpret, and then REINTERPRET a bit was great. I did this for the rest of the year.  Didn't really cost me any time because I only had short snippets for them to ever read.  But the kids loved it.  Some of them took a few days to come into their own.  But within a couple of weeks I had kids asking to do certain impersonations.  Some of them were just for fun (chewbakka).  Some of them I chose, some of them they chose.  The kids were **remembering** very well though, and that's what I wanted.  I wanted a book definition as well as a personal definition in their head, since this was all for AP testing.  Sometimes I had to correct them because the syntax of yoda might not get the correct definition from a book. The principal loved this when he came into my room one day.  I had him impersonate Bill Clinton and read a bit. 

I think that we built a better class connection too.  We found new talents in many of the students.  Some kids have amazing impersonation abilities.  Some are really good with just a couple of accents.  Some kids asked if they could sing the sentences.  It became an amazing thing, and they started talking about their vocal and acting talents outside of class. 

I had one kid do an interpretive dance.  I don't know if I'd allow that again, it took 5 minutes to get through a 3 sentence thing.  but it was fun for them anyway.

Truly the greatest idea I've had recently.

**TL;DR:  Instead of blandly reading from the textbook, I had the kids act out impersonations while reading.  ""Read in the style of..yoda. Read in the style of Bill Clinton.  Read in the style of jimmy tyler of there.  Read in the style of Mrs. Doubtfire down the hall.""  This helped kids remember, gave them a confidence boost, made great fun, and I think actually helped their reading skills a bit**",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,1373904835.0,,,True,t3_1icb7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1icb7t/greatest_silly_teaching_ideas_youve_had/,

I was digging through the spiral notebooks trying to find a class set of yellows when an older man walked up to the table. I apologized for being in the way of the other things on sale and we made small talk. I mentioned that I am a teacher and that I was happy to have made a special trip just for the one cent notebooks.

   As he was talking and I continued sorting through the boxes, he took his wallet out of his pocket. I didn't think anything of it at the time, I just figured he was making sure he had money for what he was planning to buy. He took out a dollar and said, ""I went on a bike ride this morning and found this dollar. I think you were meant to have it.""

   Now, I know a dollar isn't a lot of money, but it was such a nice gesture from a stranger. It was more than enough to pay for my class set of notebooks and put a little bit toward the other supplies I bought.

Ok, you really want to know why I didn't contact you about your daughter's schedule change? Because I shouldn't have to, that's why. I moved your daughter out of my class and into another one because she can't keep her ass off another kid's lap. 


Not to say it's entirely her problem. that kid can't keep his dick off your daughter. 


Neither of these kids does shit anywhere around our school except feel each other up. They do it in the class that leads up to mine, they do it during my class, do it during the lunch period that follows my class, and they do it in the class that follows lunch. After school your daughter and her boyfriend hide in the bushes and feel each other up


When we catch them in the bushes, they move over to the other side of the school and feel each other up behind the dumpster. They even make other students work as lookouts for them so that we don't see them. There are several adults on duty before school, after school, during class and during lunch, and every. single. one of us has talked with your daughter and her boyfriend about their behavior.  And I believe this has been brought to your attention before.


But guess what? They're both very intelligent kids. 


Moreso than you'd expect. Know why? Because your angry email complaining about how we've neglected to keep you in the loop about this and how your daughter is going to go down the tubes gradewise (now that this schedule change has taken place) shows that she's obviously conned you into believing she's a victim in this situation. 


And when I say your daughter is smart, I mean it. I don't mean that in the negative sense. I don't feel like she's conning her way through classes. I mean you've got a very intelligent, very school-capable kid here. You've got a kid who knows what she's doing and could probably blow all these other kids away. Maybe that's why she's bored in class. Maybe that's why she doesn't do a goddamned thing around our school, because she is actually able to do it. 


While the majority of the other kids are sitting around just trying to wrap their heads around the concepts we teach, your daughter probably has pretty strong hold on all of it. 


But in the meantime, while she ignores all this instruction, she's losing out on practice and other information that will enable her to continue her education. Over time her work has gotten simple and sloppy, and she's losing the skills she once acquired. She seems to think I (and a few of her other teachers) are actually going to mistake her ability to string a few words together as competence, and that we'll pass her on. But we're not buying that. That's why we moved her. We don't want that bullshit in our school. We don't want that bullshit in our classrooms. We don't want that bullshit from anyone. 


You fell for it, though. You bought the other end. 


She's obviously been telling you she's struggling in her classes and that we don't help. She's obviously been telling you she doesn't get what we're talking about and that she's afraid to ask us for help. She's obviously got you conned into believing she was in the perfect situation and that she was about to make a turnaround, but here we went and screwed it all up and she just can't handle it any more. That's garbage. She's fed you garbage. You ate it. 


Don't worry though -- she will pass on. She will pass on to the next grade and the grade after and she will sneak her way through a few classes, but unless she actually works toward something or sets a goal for herself beyond rubbing all over her boyfriend, she's going to lose every ability she already has, and she'll blame all that again on her teachers. 


By now you're probably wondering why it is I haven't addressed the whole issue of not contacting you about this beforehand. You're wondering why I haven't called you to talk about your daughter's behaviors here at school and the way she conducts herself with this boy. Here's why: I have over 150 students every day and the majority of them come to school struggling with much deeper problems than the possible pregnancy your daughter has on deck. I have students who do not live in homes. I have students who struggle to find food every day to eat. I have students with severe physical and cognitive disabilities. I have students who go home each night and make sure their parents and siblings have dinner. I have students who canot read despite their very best efforts. I have students who are addicted to drugs. I have students who cannot help but shit their pants when they get nervous. I have students who are sick and diseased. I have students whose parents have taught them to lie cheat and steal their way through school. I have students whose parents involve in robberies. I have students who get in knife fights and drive-bys. I have students who joined a boxing community so that they don't take out their aggression on their teachers any more. I have students whose parents impose religion, illness, politics, and other beliefs upon them. I have students who do not sleep more than a few hours a week. I have students who go home every night only to be abused in a myriad physical, sexual, and mental manner by their siblings and relatives and they are expected to come back to it again day after day, lest they receive another punishment. I have students whose parents skip out for months at a time and lie about coming back. I have students who wait four hours every day at the front door of our school hoping one of their parents shows, but often end up walking home in the dark. I have students who have jobs after school. I have students who have built a fort inside some trees not far from school because that's the only place they have to go when things get bad. I have students who will die before they even make it to high school, and they are acutely aware of it. They don't have time to be in love.


I have 150 kids like that.  


So does the other English teacher because we don't share students. 


There are another 400 kids at the grade level below us and another 400 at the grade level below that and every single one of those kids probably has it worse off than your daughter whose 5th period English and 6th period math classes are being switched. 


Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you've got a non-issue on your hands, and I hope this helps you to enter into a very real conversation with your daughter wherein you play the parent. 


Thanks, 

Mr.  Fakename

About six years ago, I was a high school junior (16 years old) with a teacher who was famous for being difficult. She had some pretty mean nicknames, because her class was so hard. One day, she made us memorize a speech from Henry V, beginning ""we few, we happy few, we band of brothers"" and so on, for a couple of lines. I was really annoyed with her for making us memorize it, and told her so. Told her that it was pointless, that this was memorization, not education. She told me that one day it could come in useful, that this education is important...I disagreed, and we argued over it.

Six years later, I'm teaching English in Chile, in the city that was the center of the 2010 earthquake.

 In one class, an older student told me about one of her favourite moments from a movie, Henry V. ""It's this speech! And its the most beautiful thing I've ever heard...something about band of brothers! I can't remember it, but it's beautiful!"" And she went on to say that it reminds you that you're never alone. ""I can't remember it, but.."" and she told us that we should know it, told one student that he had to hear it someday. 

And we didn't have supplies, like  Internet, or any books to look the lines up. And it didn't matter, because I had the whole speech in my head, to tell her and to tell the class. 

My question is: should I write to my old teacher to tell her this story? I'm honestly tempted to do it. I think maybe it would be nice for her to hear. On the other hand, it might completely weird the poor lady out.

Coincidentally I became the new full time teacher for this class.

I've never taught before this, and mostly only volunteered to start subbing to help out a friend.

My problem is that **I don't know how to make proper lesson plans or control the class.**

I've been trying everything I can think of for a few weeks now, but at this point I can no longer even make them all sit down and be quiet at the same time.  Someone is always talking over me, someone is always out of their seat, and I spend half the class trying to get started, calm them down, etc.

When an administrator comes by, they all become miraculously quiet angels, so I know its possible, but I can't kick every kid out every time they wont stop talking, especially since there are always at least 5 people talking.  The second I go to ask one to stop talking, another starts and I get answers like ""he's also talking""

Whats worse, I have no experience in teaching 8th grade English (and these aren't the honors students).  Trying to come up with lesson plans that will both teach them, and occupy them an entire period is an extreme challenge.  I spend almost my entire night planning lessons for them to be either ignored, or completed in under half the class.  (Also occupying them when/if they do the work I prepared more quickly than anticipated is an issue).

* **Are there any resources where I can learn how to plan teaching units and individual lessons within those units.** (without spending a fortune).

* **Are there any resources/advice for classroom management and regaining control?**

* **Is teaching something I can learn fast enough to actually teach these kids so they don't lose a year of English, and I don't lose my mind from their bad behavior.**

* **In trying to find what works, I've been very inconsistent with enforcing various rules, trying to make up my own rules, etc.  Where can I find a good list of rules that I can enforce, and what are the appropriate consequences?**

Is there any hope?  If so, what can I do to turn things around and is it something that is still repairable by me, or would it take a ""regime change"" in the form of them getting a new teacher?

Also of note: I've watched EVERY single movie I can find on teaching, but none of them show how the teacher turns the problematic behavior around on a classroom level.  I rarely find myself with time to read books of my own choosing anymore as I'm always trying to find content to fill up class time, and when not doing that trying to reprocess everything that happened and coming up with new solutions, which usually don't work.  So if you do recommend a book, it needs to be a really awesome book!


Any help that you can give will be greatly appreciated!

**UPDATE - January 2nd - Started back today**

**The advice here so far seems fantastic, thank you all so much!**

I have no set curriculum, no previous lesson plans, no cart, and there is really only one other teacher in the school who tries to help.

I try my best to make sure what we learn is building in some way off something else we learned, but sometimes the lessons seem disjointed, especially since I'm still not used to teaching this subject matter.

Though the advice of this other teacher is fantastic, he's one of those ""teacher of the year"" teachers and I have trouble modeling his advice since he is such a natural teacher, and I've never actually seen his class in action, and I don't have his personality type to do exactly everything he says. (Our schedules also don't match up, so I've only really gotten to speak to him at length once or twice when he was kind enough to stay after and answer some of my questions, though I'll admit I don't even know the right questions to ask).

He also set up all of his perfect rules on the first day, and is very good at staying consistent.

**Today I tried implementing classroom rules. It was utter mayhem.** All of my students behaved ten times worse than usual, nearly everyone got out of their seat the second I mentioned the rule that everyone needs to stay in their seat unless they raise their hand and get permission to get up.  One kid decided he wanted to leave and just left despite me telling him not to.  I literally asked him to ""please sit back down"", and pointed at his seat across the room. He responded ""no, I will not"" and left.

Then while trying to get people back in their seats, kids started throwing my dry erase markers, I'd retrieve them, ask more kids to sit down, kids would go back to the desk, pick up the markers behind my back and start throwing them. They told me these rules wont work, why am I trying, there was more talking than usual, and I literally spent all period reviewing 5 basic rules (like raising your hand to speak, raising your hand before getting up, etc.)

Two kids even managed to pull one of the desks apart while I was stopping two other kids from hitting each other. I asked another kid to sit down, he also told me no.

I asked four kids to please stop doing their math homework and pay attention to the lesson, they laughed in my face, and told me no. I took their books away (I asked for them to bring them to me, they refused, so I had to go over and take them out of their hands, and they almost fought me. Later in the class they had a friend near the front reach onto my desk and get them back while I wasn't looking, at which point I noticed them, I took them back, put them in my briefcase, and told them I'm sorry you won't have the homework for math class, but its not being done in my class. (The vice principal came to my next class to get them back saying I shouldn't do that, the math teacher wants them to have their homework).
Half the class students were sitting on top of their desks. There is plenty more of today's saga, however that's about all I can bother you all with.
I'm really about to lose it lol. I really hope I can turn this around, or I'm going to have to find a new career soon. I really dont want to abandon these kids, but they are ridiculous at times.

PS: **I tried to stay happy and upbeat throughout, and managed to smile during most of the classes, despite it all.**  Now that I'm home I feel exhausted, frazzled and I dont even know what tomorrows lesson will be teaching them.

I am now a 2nd year teacher...far from a pro in any means. I can almost guarantee you that had I have known some of these things (that perhaps you aren't taught in college) I would have had a much less stressful rookie year.

*Please add on to the list everyone!*

1.Come up with a simple method of grading homework (ex. don't grade every single problem...it will consume you.

2. Rubrics..Rubrics..Rubrics. At least have some method of grading or a model BEFORE students turn in their assignments. There is nothing worse than a pile of papers that have all veered in different directions and then you have to figure out what the hell to do. Rubrics give me the evidence I need to be able to sleep at night.

3. Don't bitch with others just because they are bitching...people complain A WHOLE LOT at school....if you join in you view the entire school as a negative environment...simply walk away.

4. Have a place to put extra copies of past work. When a student is absent they know where to get the copies...and you don't have to run around like a chicken with its head cut off because you can't find a copy/have to print one out...during class.

5. Understand that you can only help students that will accept it. If they aren't at least a little bit invested then there is little you can do to help them succeed. This does not mean give up on students, it simply means if it is March and that student is still refusing to do anything despite your differentiated approaches/every other trick you know then there is little that you can do to succeed.

6. One night a week leave the building and all of your work at the sound of the bell (or when you can contractually leave). And also do not feel guilty about doing this...remember this is a job...a unique one...but still a job..and you cannot always be focused on it. You need to remember to relax and enjoy life if you are going to reach your potential in this career.

7. On the night of parent conferences, do not just stay at school and fall asleep at your desk and be woken up by the first parent four hours later ready for their meeting....this one make come from personal experience.

8. Know what you want students to learn out of a lesson before you teach it...it avoids a boring lesson/waste of everyone's time.

9. Understand that this job is one that is very unique and you deal with individuals from all different walks of life. Try to not hold a grudge against a student for a previous action they have done. Just as they are learning academics, they are also learning life lessons. If you give up on them/noticeably display a sign of displeasure with them...they will never forget that someone gave up on them when they were ____years old. We all make mistakes and I do regret how I acted towards a student last year after a fight in school. The less personal you can take these encounters...the better.",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,False,,,True,t3_178d06,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/178d06/helpful_tips_for_first_year_teachers/,

I love this subreddit, and I read from it a lot. I see that a lot of student teachers come here for advice, and that veteran teachers like to post cool teaching gems from their own experiences.

As much as I love this subreddit, I think that it could be improved. We are all teachers here, so we know the need for clear expectations better than other human beings. Could we have clearer expectations for this subreddit?

I have a problem with the expectations because they do not really clearly explain what this subreddit is for. Honestly, I  feel as though this subreddit is currently is providing:

* a place to talk about classroom management
* a place to talk about curriculum development
* a place to talk about and share teaching techniques and lessons
* a place for new teachers to get advice from veterans
* a place to share teaching stories
* a place to share administration woes or joys
* a place to share pictures from teaching
* a place to share relevant memes about teaching
* a place to let people know you've joined the teaching profession

Do you agree that these things happen here? Should some of them stop happening? What other things are happing that I missed? How could the subreddit description be changed to reflect the subreddit? What types of posts should be kept, and which ones should ~~the Mod delete?~~ **(Edit: Why delete when we can downvote?)** Let's make our expectations crystal clear.

Also, I think it would be cool if we could get some flair that reflects our certificates or experience or positions. That way, those we advise can see what background we are coming from. Mine would say [ELAR 8-12] and [Generalist EC-6]. What do you think?

Forget your breakfast or to make your lunch? Good luck the rest of the day, you'll miss it.

It's 7:30 and you've arrived at school, in case you didn't do it last night make sure you make the copies for your class that day which may include notes/test/worksheets/project guides which always are multiple pages and you make for 150 students. This also means the previous night you had a lesson plan ready to go which may or may not work.

It's 8, your students are coming in and the announcements run. It's kind of important that they listen to them unless you want to be the teacher with the ""loud"" kids. Is it homework checking time, is it lesson time, warm-up time? That really depends but how are you going to ensure the students are doing their work and more importantly learning from doing their own work? Quiz them, talk to them, have them make a poster, test them? The goal is that they learn, not have fun, but it can happen that the learning becomes fun.

It's 8:20 Billy is loud, refuses to work, and talks and distracts his neighbors, you have 29 other students who want to learn, and one Billy, what do you do? Did your lesson call for this, did you call for this, were you not engaging enough, should you call the students parents, write him a referral, talk to him one on one. That's a choice, you're the manager, you're the leader, now you're more than just a teacher.

8:55, students were ready to leave two minutes ago, hopefully you made sure they packed up, got the homework down, and cleaned up. Cleaned up. If the first period leaves a mess, so will the next four. Have them clean up. 4 minutes till next period, are you prepared, do you teach another class (ex: teaching world history then US history). Go outside and greet students at door.

8:59 Repeating your first lesson? You should be more prepared this time.
BRUNCH

9:58 And Better this time.

10:57 And better this......no wait, you forgot this is your prep period, time to make sure you've taken attendance, talked with admin if you have any business with them (class observations/referrals/ideas for school). Try to relax a little, maybe stretch or exercise. You might even do a class observation or two to see what new ideas the other teachers are using in their classroom. You want your class to be interdisciplinary after all. Time flies, but you're lucky if your prep period is right before...

11:52 Lunch time. Are you having students come in to speak with you, are they worried about their grade, you got the grades in right, do you have test to grade in the meantime, an email to look at, are you even relaxing?

12:40 Lunch is over, start the routine of teaching again. You have a good classroom discipline policy for the lunchtime students; they're usually a little more excitable than the other periods. In fact all the periods are different from the other.

1:39 Last class of the day...maybe, that's if the classes are 55 minutes each, sometimes it's block schedule, you have to plan for that, but no matter after this class it's time for...

2:35 After school students help/tutoring/responding to parent emails/meeting with parents/meeting with staff members and faculty/making for a special ed student meeting (look up IEP and 504 if you want to understand)/department meetings. If you're still at school at 4, and you will be then you're probably...

4:00 planning for the next day, grading any quiz given or homework turned-in, creating a test, reflecting on the day. You're grading for 5 classes ( you get one off, but really you're working then to). By the way, you don't run a club do you?

6:00 Yes 6:00, if you've taken care of all you business and that means everything, (all grades put in to the computer and graded, websites updated, lessons planed, attendance took, parents called) then it's time to go home. Maybe this doesn't happen every day, but it'll happen more often than not. What's home like? Good? You did the grocery shopping and the wife is happy, can you play with the kids? Let's hope you have the energy. You're single now, but not for long as they say. After all as a teacher you're going places, not too far, but likely so if you have to teach far away from home. Make the most of your time cause at 10, we hope that you've finally got the time to..

10 Sleep. Hopefully. That one thing that you could have done differently to change a student’s life is nagging you. Come on sleep...sleep darn it, you have to be up by 6 after all!

And I would say that's the typical day of a teacher, likely in their first years. It's fun after you've perfected your routine, it's rewarding once you touch a life. It's encouraging to be a leader and to be looked up to as a role model. If you want this job, you have to be dedicated, and if the money is not good enough add extra tutoring to that 5 to 7 o'clock gap to make up the extra money.

PS I'm sure people care about the grammar, but I wrote this dodge dart commercial style.

1349135184.0,33,self.teaching,10se9a,What are your favorite WTF parents moments?,Matrinka,41,8,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/10se9a/what_are_your_favorite_wtf_parents_moments/,"So, last week, I had a spontaneous parent/teacher conference over one of my 3rd grade students.  His parents barged into my room at 3:15 on Friday after sending a nasty email, which I ignored until I spoke with someone in administration for guidance, and a handwritten note informing me that they WERE coming into my room like it or not in the afternoon.  What prompted all this anger?

One of my students loudly commented, when I brought up that our P.E. classes were going to be located in the ASD unit's ""transition"" room, that he knew ""it was where all the retards go.""  I promptly shut him down and explained that the ""r"" word is very hurtful, mean, and sounds hateful.  He became outraged and yelled out ""I only said, retarded, you don't have to get so mad.""  I told him not to say it anymore, he expressed confusion by saying ""retarded"" several time, so I pulled him to the side and explained that its a mean word that people use to describe others - like a racial slur or a ethnic slur.  It isn't nice and shouldn't be used.  He cried, but told me he understood. 

Now, this isn't the first time this kid has uttered something hateful in my room.  On 9/11 he loudly commented, right before we watched the film ""The Fireboat"" (we don't go in to too much detail about exactly what happened with the younger kids), he blurted out that he was upset to not see his ""favorite"" part of 9/11, the planes crashing into the towers.  I had to pull him to the side then, too.

Anyway, after saying ""retarded"" about 8 times, I made him sit out of recess to think about what he said and how much it would hurt other kids' feelings and their moms' and dads' feeling to hear that word used about them.  

Anyway, mom and dad went thundering into my room after school - despite my being at dismissal duty.  I calmly described the situation to them, and why my punishment was valid... and then dad pulled out a dictionary (A DICTIONARY) and tried to school me on the meaning of the word, as if I didn't already know.  At this point, the dean of the school came in and talked to them about how missing recess was actually a very mild punishment, as I could have written him a referral to our office.  They weren't happy when she explained that ""bitch"" is also in the dictionary - but is still not acceptable at school.  They then got huffy and asked what they're supposed to call those kids - to which I replied ""either children, kids, or students.""

Anyways, I'm just shocked at these people who looked and seemed normal, think ""retard"" is a good way to describe children.  That they had to gall to bring in a dictionary because they thought it would prove a point.  

Anyway, anyone else have any parent horror stories?  I need to laugh at other people dealing with some crazy, so I don't feel so alone.",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,False,,,True,t3_10se9a,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/10se9a/what_are_your_favorite_wtf_parents_moments/,

When he got arrested, the local news plastered his mug shot all over the news, the school district fired him, and he's had to grieve over the end of his career as a teacher.

As I'm thinking of entering the teaching market myself, I have to confess that this is one of my worst fears.  Is there anything I can do as a teacher to protect myself in case a kid decides to ruin my life because he/she has some issue with me?

I figure most people on this subreddit are already teachers, but for those like me who WANT to be a teacher, I found some great free undergraduate education courses on MIT's website.

I want to partake in the courses, but MIT basically posts all the content and provides no discussion boards or active interactive feedback. I was wondering if anyone out there would like to do the courses along with me so we can be fellow students and bounce ideas off each other and whatnot throughout the courses. I think it would be more fulfilling that way.

Here are the courses I was planning on checking out:

[Introduction to Education](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-124-introduction-to-education-looking-forward-and-looking-back-on-education-fall-2011/index.htm)

[Educational Theory and Practice](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/urban-studies-and-planning/11-129-educational-theory-and-practice-i-fall-2011/)

[Learning Seminar: Experiments in Education](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/special-programs/sp-291-learning-seminar-experiments-in-education-spring-2003/index.htm)


Additional Info: Doing these courses does not give you any certification or undergrad credit, but I hope they provide good background info on teaching. I want to pursue early childhood teaching (I have a BA in English Literature) and everyone says to go to grad school. But I've read grad school doesn't teach you HOW to be a teacher.....it basically just helps you get into a high pay bracket (I admit I may be very wrong about these thoughts). So anyway, I'm hoping these courses will help me learn how to teach, which I think is very important.

I'm sure some teachers already do this, but no other teacher I know does.

***It is a huge pain in the ass to set-up at the beginning of the year, but well worth it.***

At the beginning of the year I hand out my syllabus with a form on the back for parents to fill out their contact information. It has standard information on it like...

* Who do you live with?
* What is their phone number?
* What is their e-mail? 
* Do they speak English? (40% at my school don't)

In order to get kids to do this, I tell them that I will do two things.

1. I will give them points for it. I make it a 20 point assignment which is a pretty significant grade. Very easy points to start off the beginning of the year.

2. I tell them I will call or e-mail home and say something about what a good student they are to their parents. (This is tough as sometimes they are already a nightmare)

This way the kids are eager to hand over all of this information.

Once I get the information back, I create contacts in outlook sorted by class period - with 170 high school students, this can take some time. Small chunk it - a half hour or so a day will get in done within the first two weeks.
 
I then e-mail all the parents I can to say something nice and I attempt to call the rest.

-------------------

I have had A LOT of parents contact me saying that I am the only teacher that is ever in touch with them. I have even had two write to the school Principal about how well I communicate. With no tenure, this bodes well for me.

Here are somethings that I e-mail home about....


* **Missing Work?** E-mail home to the parents and attach the assignments to the e-mail (this takes a while because you have to do it individually, not a mass e-mail)

* **Pop Quiz/Test coming up?** E-mail the parents and tell them exactly what their kid needs to study (I was surprised how many kids came in ""upset"" because their parents made them study

* **Grades Posted/Updated?** Send out an e-mail letting them know to check online

* **Important Date/Deadline Coming Up?** Send out e-mail reminders to all the parents. I sent out probably 10 e-mails leading up to open house and a field trip and I had the highest turn out rate in my school.

* **Homework Assignment?** E-mail home and let the parents know. Most kids will lie and say they don't have anything due.

* **Kid acting out in class?** E-mail home to the parent. I used to hate having to stop my class to call home when a kid was being a total ass. Once your students know that you e-mail home CONSTANTLY, *most* will fear even the threat of an e-mail home.

I probably spend at most, 15 minutes a week typing up these e-mails to parents and it WORKS. My kids know they better get their work done or their parents will find out.

And if the parents don't speak English? At the bottom in my signature I have a link to Google Translate in Spanish that says ""If you do not speak English please click here to translate"".

Finally, this also creates a paper trail of communication if you ever need it for guidance/administration issues.

**tl;dr:** create e-mail lists of parents and contact them regularly to ensure students study, complete all work, and behave.",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,False,,,True,t3_lq831,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/lq831/create_email_lists_and_keep_in_contact_with/,

This was a whole day workshop, but one point in particular really stood out to me.  On the samples that got a top score on the writing exemplars, one of the students made up statistics to prove her point.  Literally, stats about a study at Harvard, at Princeton, about Bill Gates' history - it was all made up.  However, the expert reasoned, because the made up statistics supported her topic sentences, she was given credit for them.

I went to my supervisor yesterday to ask her about this since when I presented this to my classes, my honors kids said ""I can't do that!"" They were REALLY uncomfortable with the idea of making up stats, and I frankly couldn't blame them.  We had just spent three weeks on a research paper where I said the word ""cite"" more times than Republicans attack teachers!

So anyway, my supervisor said to me ""we would never advocate making up information anywhere else -- but for this purpose and this audience it's okay.""

AND BOUGHT THE REALLY POOR KIDS MCDONALDS on the way home. This is a special woman.

Today, she is supposed to be turning in her grades and clearing her room.

Care to help?,brianfediuk,33,9,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/167yrq/hello_reddit_educators_my_name_is_brian_fediuk_i/,"Greetings, my name is [Brian Fediuk](http://brianfediuk.com). I am an information technology teacher, technology geek and casual web developer. I am currently developing a website that offers comprehensive tutorials to help teachers step up to becoming 21st century educators through creation of a website, [Teach With a Website](http://teachwithawebsite.com). I hope to offer multiple paths to create these websites. Currently, I am developing guides for the following types of classroom websites:

**Content Management System** - Well rounded environment, allows for a lot of customization and features(Joomla). Basic uses include a landing page for information, a calendar, a file repository, etc. Advanced uses include a registered-user-only website where students have a live chat, online storage for their files(backup and/or handing in work), commenting sections as a ticket out the door, user profiles, and much much more

**Blog** - A blogging system allows a teacher to post blog posts for his or her classroom daily, weekly, monthly, or whatever, for their students read and add a response. Also allows for students to make their own posts to the blog to generate discussion

**Wiki** - Collaborative system where the class makes, edits and moderates entries for the information in the class. Students are in charge of developing their personal resources, which leans more towards a ""flipped classroom""

**Discussion Board** - Students use a message forum to discuss material related to the class. Great for homework, written assignments, etc.

Now, aside from the lack of fully developed guides, I was wondering if you could offer any insight, advice, preferences, or anything else that you might think could be valuable to the development of this website as a resource to teachers. My overall goal is to contribute to the educational world not only through my teaching, but also offer a little something to get non-technology savvy teachers into the technology world, even if they have to follow a step-by-step guide.

Finally, what features or capabilities would you like your ""dream website"" to have?

If you have any questions, I would be more than happy to answer them.

Thanks for your time, Reddit. Happy teaching!

I already got three angry responses. I'm having nightmares about them. Two of them were seniors and I'm honestly a little shocked that their parents are still blaming me for the student's problems. One of them was expressly advised not to take this class (it's an optional class) but took it anyway, and now I'm being somewhat passive-aggressively blamed for him not getting into his college of choice. The other was doing fine (C avg) but had a test that she kept putting off making up; when she finally did, it was a really low grade and dropped the kid to a D. I got the test one day before the final exam, which the kid then scored a 60% on. How is that my fault? How was I supposed to have ""warned"" the parent about this? And the parent went so far as to forward a very angry response (full of CAPS and !!!!!!) straight to the headmaster and principal. Neither have responded yet; I tried my hardest to write a professional, detailed, sympathetic reply as soon as I got the email, and haven't heard anything back. 

I'm just feeling beat down. I haven't really slept well since break began thinking about these angry people. Why are parents so quick to lash out at the teacher? What do you do to deal with it? I don't have the confidence and experience of an older teacher so this makes me very nervous.

**EDIT:** thank you all for your supportive responses. I know deep down most of what you all said is true and that as long as I can support what I've done I should be fine, but I'm still new and just not used to people coming down on me. I think I graded a little too easy my first year to avoid conflict but now I'm trying to raise the bar in my department and that is resulting in some lower grades...

As an update, one of the parents was pretty cordial, ended up still kind of blaming me for ""oversight"" but wants to focus on how we can help the student next semester, which is great. Another calmed down a lot in the second reply but is still seeking a grade change or re-take of the final because of some family issues that were going on... I'm referring that one to the principals. The third (and worst offender - the one with parts in all caps) never responded to my reply. I just got an email from the principal yesterday that said to let them know if I need any support and saying they hoped I'm having a good break despite the email, so I'm glad to hear they are supportive. Oh, and I had one other that I got a response from the student (never from the parents which was a little odd) where she's claiming she has homework that was graded that I didn't get in my book, so we'll see what she shows me when we get back to school.",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,True,,,True,t3_nlfn7,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/nlfn7/not_even_enjoying_break_yet_because_of_angry/,

I went to college 20+ years ago to become a science teacher, and dropped out because I was young and stupid and making good money (in the construction industry) at the time.  

Flash forward to now...20 years of a career I more or less hated; one which has left me jobless and with no prospects for future employment.  I have a wonderful wife, 2 great children, and a home we all love very much.  

I am going to walk away from the home...because keeping it, if it is possible, will cost me my soul.  And without my soul...what kind of husband and father can I be?  I am intentionally giving it all up (haha, yes, in great part because I am probably going to lose it anyway) to chase down a dream.  

The idea hit me a few weeks ago: I am going to go back to school, get my B.S. in biology, and minor in earth sciences, and then I am going to teach high school science.  

Why these disciplines?  Because they are my life's passion.  As a kid, I walked the woods of Missouri collecting anything that made it's way in to my hand...fossils, rocks, bugs, leaves, mushrooms, snakes....you name it, I collected it, caught it or killed it.  This is a hobby that continues to this day...with the catching being very temporary and the killing replaced by photography.  

I know it's crazy as hell to make such a drastic change at this point in my life.  And I know I will not get rich as a school teacher. But fact is...I do not care.  I am tired of playing the game of attempting to accumulate wealth and possessions purely for the sake of it. I'm only really happy when I am walking in the woods with my kids, teaching them the things I have learned over the years.  I may as well make a career out of it, and live the rest of my life humbly and happy.  

My wife supports me...my kids will probably hate me at first...but they are still young, and I will keep them fed and clothed and one day I hope they will understand and forgive me.  

I am going to go back to school, and then I am going to teach my inherent love of the world around me to the next generation or two.

And I have not been as excited about life since I was, well, 20 years old.  

Wish me luck.

In one of my classes a bold youngster asked me who I was voting for.  Before I could even react, several students turned and informed him, in no uncertain terms, that he was not allowed to ask a teacher that.  (I had no idea that was a rule, but to them it was.)

It was, I'd judge, a good 80% of the kids who reacted instantaneously - I've never seen anything like it.  One student said loudly, ""Everyone's vote is private!""  Another said, ""You shouldn't ask anyone!  Not even your friends!  It's disrespectful!""

The general response among them seemed to be that this was a major faux pas, and it was as amusing as it was enlightening.  They didn't scold him so much as enlighten him, quite gently and eloquently, I thought.  I thanked the student for asking, but told him that I preferred to keep my preferences private.  

Considering that normally students are riveted when that one bold kid (whoever it may be) asks me a controversial question, it was interesting to see how diligently they protected my privacy in this case.

1336692262.0,24,self.teaching,thao8,Can I just vent for a sec? Regarding discipline in the classroom.,circledot,25,1,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/thao8/can_i_just_vent_for_a_sec_regarding_discipline_in/,"Hi all. So I teach high school English at an urban school. It's especially tough right now, as it always is this time of year, especially for my seniors.

At our school, tardies are a big issue. The school is big and kids want to be social during passing periods. We have a policy where if students are late to class, we are to shut our doors and not let the students in until they have a tardy pass from the dean. Toward the end of the year, students who have many tardies face more severe consequences, so they avoid getting the tardy passes and instead try to sneak into class although they are late, or just skip class after being asked to get a tardy pass.

So today, this group of four really difficult students is out in the hallway before class goofing around when the bell rings. They all run into my classroom trying not to be late, but this is a considerable amount of time since the bell so I'm standing in my doorway getting ready to close the door. As I stand in the doorway, I tell them to go get a pass and they stop briefly, start cussing at me, and then push me/shove me down so they can get into the room. After I almost fall and hit my head they rush to their seats, giggling/laughing and refusing to leave the room and comply with my requests to get a pass.

I've taught here for a while and I've never had a student put his/her hands on me. That's a line even the toughest students typically do not cross, and I'm more than not a well-liked teacher who doesn't have *huge* issues. I've been cussed at and had students be very verbally disrespectful, but kids know they are not to take it to a physical level.

I call the dean to have them removed and they come down; I write factual referrals for all the students involved. Later in the period, my assistant principal comes down and explains she knows all the kids personally and they ""just wanted to be in class on time"", that they didn't mean anything malicious and were just being goofy. I can tell from the way she tells the story that most of the group just blatantly lied to her; they are saying I ""threatened to press charges"" and that I let multiple students in late but not them, which didn't happen. She asked if they could come back to my class. I wasn't comfortable with that since this group of students is very argumentative/confrontational, and I also feel they would not perceive their actions as having any consequences. So they were assigned cafeteria cleanup duty just for the next 20 minutes, and as far as I can tell no other consequences.

What do you guys think about this situation? Am I overreacting? I've been upset all day over it because I feel it's hardly even worth reporting this kind of stuff anymore, because I'll just inevitably end up feeling like the administration thinks it's my fault.

I'm now considering getting an MAT, but I've been very frustrated with my experiences. Here are just some of the reasons why I hesitate to become a male teacher in the US in 2011.

----

** Pedophilia Paranoia**

I frequently hear the subtext of pedophila in jokes/conversations*. 

* Massachusetts requires all teachers to undergo a criminal background check. Mine has taken longer than usual, and I'm still trying to figure out why. My coworkers joke, ""Oh, maybe it's because you're a pedophile."" My supervisor remarked, ""Maybe you have a dirty background.""

*  I work with autistic students who like to ""cuddle."" Although I think physical contact is important for children, I keep my distance because it makes me extremely uncomfortable when I get looks from co-workers and parents.

* An older, female co-worker approached me last week, commenting ""These 5th grade girls are so much more sexual than they used to be."" I replied, ""You think so?"" She replied, ""Are you kidding? They're all over you."" I later learned that **she says this to all the male staff**. I now try to minimize my contact with female students. 

**Bureaucratic Red Tape**

The bureaucratic efficiency of public schools verges on absurdity. Examples:

* **Certification/licensure** US public schools require certification/licensure to teach. The problem is that they're unclear about what this means. Over the last four years, the terms ""certification"" and ""licensure"" have been used to tell me that I need a either an education BA, or an MAT, or an MED, or complete the MTEL (a test required to get a certificate). When I talk to other teachers, they're unclear about the differences between these programs.


* **Background Check (BC)** - It has taken over a month for my BC to clear. Until then, I can't substitue teach, and I can't be alone with students. I've been calling and emailing my schools for weeks to find out why it's taking so long. Finally, I called the BC government department, only to learn that there was a miscommunication (not sure why, yet) and that my BC was sent to one of my schools THREE WEKS AGO. They finally recognized the error this morning.

* **Payroll** When I began teaching, my supervisor agreed to pay me more than what the job description offered. It took two months for this to finally be reflected on my pay-check, and only after I called payroll many times to have this fixed. 

**Prestige**

Friends and family don't regard teaching as a worth-while career. When I told my mother that I was going to be a teacher, she replied, ""Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach."" 

**Career Advancement**

Once I become a full-time teacher, where do I go from there? Not very far. Could I become a principal? Perhaps. A super intendent? Maybe. But would these be satisfying positions?

**Salary**

I don't need to beat that dead horse.

----
**TL;DR:** There are many reasons why a qualified male would hesitate to go into teaching. 

**Edit Note:** I previously wrote that I constantly receive comments that I'm a pedofile. This language is too strong, since these ""accusations"" have been intended as jokes, albeit misplaced. 

----

**UPDATE: 10/6/2011 : 9am**

Responses to many of the comments made below:

* **Your mom is a [pejorative noun]:** My mother and I don't get along well. I try to keep my distance and bite my tongue when she crosses the line (or raves about how she loves the tea-party/Fox news or hates Obama/Teachers unions)

* **I'm a teacher, and I sympathize with your post:** Thanks for your comments. It's nice to know that I'm not alone with these frustrations. 

* **Female teachers share the same frustrations about Bureaucracy/Prestige/Etc:** You're right. I recognize that. Thank you for clarifying my post. 

* **If you don't like the job, then quit. Stop complaining:** I agree with these sentiments: I don't like it when people complain. My chief interest was to create dialogue about men in the classroom. I like the job, and, no, you can't have it.   

* **Watch this video of [Taylor Mali](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RxsOVK4syxU):** Done. Pretty great video. Thanks!

I am currently on my way to obtaining my licensure for secondary Ed in both Math and Biology. My question to you lovely folks is this: how much of my personal life should I keep hidden?

I have also had people tell me not to hide it--but not to make a big deal out of it (this is where I'm leaning). Coming from my high school experience, I want to help end the homophobia/bullying that is rampant in our schools, and I want to let out/closeted LGBT students know that they have someone to come to if they need help, and to show them that it's okay to be out, and proud!

When I let my principal know that I had accepted an offer from a different school, she congratulated me and then asked what the assignment was. When I told her kindergarten she said ""Oh, you're male, of course you got it."" She didn't say it maliciously, but I was still offended.

This principal has only recently (2-3 weeks) transferred into my school, which has about 50 teaching staff. It's pretty safe to say that she knows very little about me. I also researched my soon to be new school, took professional development opportunities to make me more marketable, and have experience at the primary level (including kindergarten). Not to mention that I killed it in the interview and had references that spoke highly of my abilities.

So I feel that reducing my success to the fact that I'm male in a female dominated workplace is somewhat sexist. Incidentally, my principal is new and a black woman. I'm sure if I attributed her success in getting her position to either of those factors she and most other people would have a major issue with it, and rightly so.

Beyond belief. To the point where my own students' safety is sometimes in question because there have been three fights in my classroom thus far. 

Let's talk management systems: I have two different colored post-its on each students' desk. When they lose the first, it's a warning. When they lose the second, it's their first consequence and they don't get a signature on their point card (a school-based incentive system). After that, it's a phone call home and detention. Is there something else I could put in between there that would be helpful? I definitely need to be more consistent with my consequences.

My most frequent problem is just the entire class talking. Constantly. Over me, in very blatantly disrespectful ways. They ignore my attention-signal very blatantly, such that I had to stop doing the ""clap if you can hear my voice"" thing because they have started refusing to do it (they used to but I guess they just decided I am not worth taking seriously anymore) so I just do a countdown. It doesn't really work most of the time. 

There is just so much disrespect being hurled my way that I basically want to cry at the end of every day. I REALLY try not to take it personally and at the beginning I was doing fine at it but at this point it kind of is personal - they hate me because I am not teaching them well, I am not teaching them well because I can't get them to be quiet and follow directions, I can't get them to be quiet and follow directions because I'm a shitty teacher.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I feel like a complete failure. I've wanted to teach my entire life and it has taken a month of teaching middle school to pretty much convince me that I am completely incapable of doing this. To top it all off, I feel like most people around me believe I am incapable of doing this. I think my principal has lost all faith in me and I would not be surprised if I'm fired by the end of October. I have been reaching out to my AP and my instructional leader and other teachers for support and advice and they have been helpful but so far everything I'm trying just seems to fail. 

I know that I have to improve my consistency but at the same time, I think the core of it is not having my students' respect and I am not sure how to achieve that.

It has just become an absolute grind to even get up and go to work, because we both feel that no matter how hard we try, how much effort we give, and how much we care, ultimately; the students don't, the administration certainly doesn't, and the parents don't.

However, at my school I've noticed that there is always around 20% of the class which is simply interested in doing the bare minimum. Or less than the bare minimum. 

Is it really my job to motivate them all to work? My last class a student said that my class was ""boring"". Well, yes, it's boring because programming isn't always the most excited thing in the world. That is, unless, you actually have passion about programming (as the majority of the class does). I've spent a long time designing my course and I know the other students are benefitting but I refuse to act like a babysitter. Today one student asked if she could leave early (after finishing the assignments with the minimum amount of work required) and I simply stated that she can always leave any time she wants. She's an adult now, and not in high school anymore. If you want to leave my class, then leave :D And the same goes for students who miss assignments. Is it really my job to hunt them down, and make sure they get everything in on time? Or should they just read the syllabus and turn everything in correctly as the vast majority of students do.

I don't want to come off as cold and uncaring. I'm not in the least and I'll spend an hour after class with a student if he's passionate about learning. The thing I find strange however is that so many teachers are teaching at a pre-college level, and the goal is to save some students, or motivate them to learn. Now that they've chosen their major, and society deems them an adult I couldn't care less about motivating those who clearly aren't motivating themselves. 

Does that make me a terrible teacher? 

Also I'm interested in how fun should every class should be. Sure, it's obviously better to have fun things to do to enhance learning. And I have absolutely no problem with teachers who make learning fun. But at a certain point, staring at a huge screen full of code for eight hours (minimum) a day for 7 days a week is going to get a little draining.  If they think this is a ""fun"" field to go into perhaps they should rethink their major. It can be interesting and challenging, but I don't know if it's necessarily always supposed to be fun. I'm sorry but I just don't think it's a teachers duty to keep students entertained. I can't help but think this is a cultural phenomenon. I can't imagine a student in South Korea asking a professor if he could make his lessons more ""fun"" :D

But... it doesn't have the prestige of teaching. It doesn't require a degree and it doesn't have the pay potential of teaching. But I see it as my way out, and a way to get my life back for a year or two before I look for other things.

He has probably completed 3-4 assignments for each subject in the 8 months we've been in school.  He typically does absolutely nothing in my class, but has recently begun disrupting others with his behavior (he makes faces, makes fart noises, giggles, tattles, says inappropriate (sexual) comments, etc.) which has landed him in the principal's office twice now.

Today I had to take him again.  Our principal talked to him about not doing his work and explained that if he doesn't do 4th grade work, there is no way she can send him to 5th grade next year.  She then explained that all his friends would be moving on to 5th grade and he'd be stuck with me for another year.  He says, ""That's what I want!""  She looked at him, dumbfounded.

It's been a miserable experience and I'm finally realizing that this isn't for me at all.

Teaching has always been a back up for me and I've never been particularly interested in it. I just picked it up and for whatever reason decided to stick with it. I've made no friends in the program (all of my friends are taking up other studies at the university), and I've always hated my edu courses. I don't know why it took so long, but now that I'm actually in the field as a student teacher, I've realized the mistake I've made. 

I have no interest in kids. I'm not passionate about helping them. I don't care much for my concentration (math). In the beginning it seemed like a decent backup because of the vacation hours and I had a blast when I was in high school fucking around with my teachers. I've now realized that I was interested in all the wrong things with the profession. I was looking at the rewards and not the job itself. I thought about the traits and qualities of all of my favorite teachers, and I've come to realize that these are not traits that I embody. 

I kept chugging along thinking ""this is just a backup, all you want is a degree, just get it and move on"" and here I am now and I'm not sure if I can keep this up. There's three months left but I'm constantly stressed, depressed and overall miserable. I get emails from my university about mandatory career meetings and I just sit around and sulk while I'm there. 

I thought maybe I can just work hard and keep pushing until graduation but my sponsor teacher has finally pulled me aside and expressed her concern about the kids. My performance in the classroom is putting their grades at risk. 

I keep trying to get better and take suggestions but it's not helping me. It's not a matter of me not working hard enough. Student teaching has pretty much consumed my life and despite all the work I put in, I'm not seeing any improvement. 

I'm tempted to just drop it and move on to something to else but it seems like such a waste since it's my final semester. My parents and my friends have suggested switching majors to something that will make me happier but I don't want to delay my graduation. Maybe I can deal with one extra semester, but I don't want to stay in school any longer. I honestly don't care what my degree is in, I just want one under my belt.

We teach chemistry, which in our state is a required class for all students, even though not all students have the skills. Our student grades our either Bs &amp; Cs or Fs. We've talked to the students with no luck. We're smoothing out our lessons every year, and we're making things as easy as possible for students. I spent my entire hour and a half planning period calling home and emailing counsellors about failing students; I checked in with counsellors to make sure they received all the info, and I get nothing back.

5. You must learn to write believable budget justifications.

7. Each grant has specific rules you need to follow. Read the instructions carefully.
8. There's no substitute for a great idea or enthusiasm in your writing. Counts for a lot compared to technical competency.

It's a weird feeling.,octopus1138,26,6,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/hyf83/im_failing_my_first_student_out_of_college_its_a/,"I teach oral English and culture in a college in Shanghai. Obviously this means it's a high level and quite advanced class. You can't come in knowing only the words ""hello"" and ""thank you"" and expect to pass. I should also point out that, maturity-wise, people in China are about four years behind the level of Americans. So in college they really act more like high schoolers.

I try to accommodate as many levels as I can in each of my lessons, but I can't really get much lower than intermediate simply because I don't speak any Chinese. They need to be at least intermediate for us to be able to communicate with each other.

This one guy hasn't turned in any homework and was often quite rude to me. He would take out his cell phone and play games or read some other book while in my class and would roll his eyes at me when I told him to take part in class. Obviously this is not acceptable because bad attitudes like that can spread and if I need to partner people up I can't have this guy affecting other students.

I've kicked him out of class a couple of times.

When I told him ""Leave class"" the most recent time he said ""I don't understand"" in Chinese and put on his headphones and sat there reading. I tried to explain further, even got someone who could speak Chinese for me (which I think is highly unfair to my interpreting student and to his privacy). When I tried to say it in Chinese myself he would scoff me and said: ""My *head* teacher said I have to stay in class. So I'm not leaving class."" and I was like ""Oh man I am going to kill his head teacher for getting involved in my class.""

So I talked to his head teacher and was all like ""how dare you undermine my authority"", and she started telling me he's from a poor family, probably the first person in his family to go college. I said: ""Don't care. Being poor doesn't mean you get to be disrespectful and not pay attention in class.""

She tells me: ""He doesn't know any English"" and I say: ""Then why on earth is he in an advanced English class?""

She tells me: ""If he doesn't pass your class, then he gets kicked out of college. You're the last class he needs."" and I'm like: ""Then he should fail out college.""

So eventually he apologized and wrote me this long note, in pretty decent English mind you, about being sorry. I accepted it, pat him on the shoulder, wanted bygones to be bygones as long as he stopped being a dick in my class. That day he was good, he was looking stuff up in his dictionary and while he didn't understand everything that was being thrown at him he at least looked like he was trying.

Final day of class rolls around and he doesn't show up to do the final test. He hasn't even done any of the homework over the course of the semester to make up for it.

Fuck that guy for making me fail a poor chinese kid who was probably the first in his family to go to college. He makes me feel like an asshole.

1. I'm going to get rid of clutter. I have STACKS of old test prep materials stacked against my back wall, most of it at least a year old. I'll ask the library what they want back, dump the rest.

2. I love teaching vocabulary; I think there's a lot of bang for the buck as far as time invested. The books are meant to be consumable, used once or twice and I've had some of them for 6 years. I doubt I could find a clean class set. I'm going to look for a new book of vocab words, maybe based on our state testing. I'm going to make a 'word wall', put the words up with definitions and sample sentences. Then, I'll have the kids 'adopt' one or two words each to teach to the rest of the class. Their grade will be based on how well they learned all of the words **and** how well they taught their assigned words to the rest of the class, based on the scores. 

3. I am going to find a workable, enforceable attendance policy this year. I am hardcore about rules being violated in class, cheating/copying...but I suck at informing parents about ditching or tardies and our system for checking truancies is a joke.

Elementary (3rd grade) teacher here; I don't write lesson plans. My school's administration does not require that we submit them, or I would be in hot water by now! They just take too much time to write up with not enough of a pay-off for me.

Honestly, who has the time to write up daily lesson plans that actually describe in detail what you will be teaching and how you will be teaching it, for every subject each day? And after all that time spent planning it all out, you almost always end up reorganizing and changing things as you teach anyways, as you respond to the needs of your class.

It's my opinion (based on countless conversations with veteran teachers who I respect, and my own, more limited experiences) that the whole submitting lesson plans thing is one big, unfunny joke. I'd bet that most of the plans teachers submit are never read by administrators. They probably sit in someone's inbox collecting metaphorical dust unless the teacher is going to be evaluated.

I have a ""teacher notebook"" I created and that's the only place I write down what I plan to teach. I created a two-page calendar-style chart that shows the weekly schedule and has a little space for each subject, where I write a minimal description of what I will be teaching, usually two or three words to describe each lesson. I find it extremely helpful and easy to use, and best of all it doesn't take too much of my valuable time. Seriously, between a full day teaching (did I mention we don't have duty-free lunch or recess?), constant meetings during ""planning time"", and gathering materials/lesson prep, there is not enough time in the day to write out plans.

My boyfriend recently asked me how much I spend per month on my students and I estimated about $200/month.  He suggested I reach out to other teachers of younger-aged students to see how they spend during the year.  Because I don't use standard curriculum books as many of the older grades do and instead build most of my own curriculum, I find myself coming up with ideas that ultimately call for items to be bought.


I am given $500 at the end of each year to spend on my class by the school but as I think many of you might know, 500 bucks goes fast if you need new furniture for the play-center or a new radio. For Halloween, Christmas, birthdays, and now Easter, I've been buying things from the dollar-store or Walmart to make goody bags for the kids.  Things like tissues and baby wipes are used up SO quickly and even when I request donations to be made by parents, most of them don't send anything in.  Books I have are mostly used, old, and get torn easily - especially by some of my rough boys.  A lot of my spending goes towards those things.


I'm in my early 20s and this is my second year teaching.  I sometimes feel my eagerness to be an awesome/fun/engaging teacher pushes me to spend more than I should.  But I don't see a way around it.  I want to give my students meaningful experiences and if I think of something amazing or see online what another teacher has done that I know my kids will love, I NEED to go out and buy the materials so we can do it.  Of course not all lessons call for things to be bought.  But I like to do many activities that the kids can take home so their families can keep them.  

My boyfriend thinks that I'm doing too much and that I should tone it down a bit.  I don't have huge amounts of money to spare (obviously..) and I don't even have my own family to support yet so..I'm not sure how this out-of-pocket spending is going to work in the long-run when I get my own children and have more bills to pay.

I'm getting better at one-on-one stuff but the thing that stumps me most is how to IMMEDIATELY react when a student repeatedly talks out while I'm giving instructions or directions.

Here are the choices and my issues I've used/thought of so far:

-Ignore it, then talk to student later privately.  Good thing is you keep it private and kid is more likely to respond respectfully and feel respected.  Bad things are that it could appear that there are no consequences and the student may continue to disrupt.  Also gives other kids the idea that they can do it too.

-""I'm waiting!"" Some teachers swear by this.  I have never gotten it to work because while I'm waiting for student A, student B now starts talking and soon the class is completely off task.  Now I have 15 problems instead of just one.

-Ask student to move to a different seat/corner/time out.  This is usually effective in the long run because now the student is away from friends, but they usually take FOREVER to move, or it provokes a confrontation in front of the class.  Both of these disrupt even more and becomes exciting entertainment for the class that they want to extend as long as possible.

1361032983.0,16,self.teaching,18n5bu,"Some questions and concerns from a student teacher after 3 weeks in the classroom (a bit of a rant, really):",haigenstein,16,0,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/18n5bu/some_questions_and_concerns_from_a_student/,"Ok, first of all, anyone that says that teachers are overpaid doesn't konw what they are talking about!  Any teacher that puts in even the minimal amount of effort required works extremely difficult and long hours.  Maybe things used to be different, but teachers are held to so many standards and expected to perform so many roles and tasks today.  So, respect to all of you that have been doing this for a while.

Anyway, 3 weeks into my student teaching, I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.  More than anything, I just want to vent!  But your feedback is appreciated!

Concern #1:  My cooperating teacher (CT) told me in my first week that, ""All student teachers have a breakdown at some point.""  That really scared me!  As someone that has mental health issues, the idea of a breakdown is especially scary.  

Concern #2:  My CT told me that she once had to fire a student teacher, and had another student teacher that decided she didn't want to teach by the end of her student teaching experience.  Again - just kind of scary.

Concern #3:  I have to attend PLC meetings, and I hate them!  It means that curriculum and tests that I create during my student teaching experience are used not only in my CT's classroom, but also by other teachers!  So, I feel like I'm reporting to multiple teachers with different expectations.  Just adds to the stress.

Concern #4:  My CT is often difficult to understand, and I know that the students feel this as well, just based on their responses in class.  This leads to errors on my part, because communication is not always clear.  CT tends to speak very fast and while performing other tasks, making it hard to pick up everything.

Concern #5:   I recently had a PLC meeting (a.k.a. Hell), where two teachers with very different goals were both constructing revisions for a test that I had to create.  After struggling to make note of every detail that they eventually agreed upon, I created the test, but had a few ""mistakes,"" all of which were minor and a result of misunderstanding what the two teachers had agreed upon.  So, anyway, my cooperating teacher notices the ""mistakes,"" which were really just minor misunderstandings (very understandable in a PLC meeting with two teachers that don't necessarily agree upon or understand the material in the first place), and asks me the following:  ""Don't take this the wrong way, but have you had trouble taking verbal direction in the past?""  Needless to say, I was completely deflated.  After becoming pretty much silent, because I did not want to say something flippant out of anger, she adds insult to injury by saying, ""You know, when you get silent like that, I take it as being rude.""  This kind of thing is constant!  I have no time to breathe or reflect, and the criticisms just get more and more harsh and personal.  

Concern #6:  There have been several instances where my CT has ""corrected"" me on things which were not incorrect.  For example, I was corrected on my definition of ""open verse,"" which was based on the definition in the textbook, which is based on the Common Core Standards!  This has been a recurring thing.  I don't know how to deal with being corrected when I am presenting information about the content correctly because the CT is misinformed or confused.  

Concern #7:  CT is a bit harsh and sarcastic at times, and I have seen her in confrontations with other faculty already.

Question #1:  Do you think it's normal to have this much stress at this point?

Question #2:  Do you have any suggestions for dealing with any of these concerns?

Question #3:  Do you think that maybe I'm just too sensitive for teaching?  Maybe I should just quit now.  I love the actual teaching, and I have received positive feedback on my abilities, but I don't know if I can take another 10 weeks with this woman constantly watching me like a hawk and criticizing my every move.

Question #4:  Any ideas for stress relief??  I think that I may possibly benefit from getting laid.

Thanks!

EDIT:  I just want to add that while I don't really feel like I'm getting along so well with my CT, I think and certainly HOPE that has good intentions, and HAS provided some positive and helpful feedback.  Just wanted to add that to give a complete picture.

I knew it was going to be a stark contrast, but entering week 6 I'm beginning to get very fed up with a lot of my students. 

When I went to High School even if we didn't like the class or we didn't like the teacher, we did the work. All we wanted to do was have the teacher not pay attention to us and get on with our day. 

Where I'm student teaching most of my students simply refuse to do work 80% of the time. I will teach a chapter and have students feign paying attention and then when I do problems with them, some students will do the work knowing they get free points on those assignments and others will sit there. Then I will assign work for them to do on their own (can't assign homework here, they won't do it) and they will sit at their computer stations and stare blankly at the screen until the bell rings. 

At the end of one of my last units we had every student (with the exception of 3 total students across all 4 sections) missing 4 or more assignments. We called them up, gave them a list of their missing work (some of which was work we have literally walked them through and given them all the answers to), and gave a total of 5 days to work on everything. 5 days. At the end of that 5 days some students had turned in most of their work, a small number were all caught up, and most students said, and I quote, ""Dude, man! This is a lot of work! Can't we get like a work week or something?!"". A work week? You're asking for a  work week after you've just a week to do all your assignments and you sat there and did nothing instead? Not happening. 

Today I gave a Test to my third hour. They were told on Monday so start working on their study guides. On Wednesday they were given the day to work on their study guides. It was going to be 15 minutes working on your own, 15 minutes of me covering the study guide, and 15 minutes of them studying their corrected guides. 2 of the 10 students worked at all so I sat there all period and didn't give them answers. At the end of the period I gave copies of the answer key to the study guide to the students who worked all period. Today the students came in, complained that it was unfair to have a test today when I ""just assigned the study guide yesterday"" and ""How were we supposed to study when you didn't give us the answers?"". They have two days to take a 40 questions test, and they got to use their books the last ten minutes today. This would have been unheard of in my High School, especially when the only reason they want more time is because of how lazy they are. They have seen every test question today, they know EXACTLY what to study. But tomorrow they will come in and beg and plead to use their books because they can't possible be bothered to learn anything on their own. 

I'm frustrated. I know this is a rant, but this has been ongoing in this school. A school where if a student doesn't show up to class ever they are handed a 40% and they are handed a 50% for writing their name on a paper. This isn't what education is about, this isn't why I wanted to teach. 

Please, someone, tell me it's different at other schools. I don't know if I can handle how much of a mockery this system is the what education and learning should be about. 

TL;DR - I'm bending over backwards to give my students the information they should be learning on their own on a platter and they still refuse to reach out and take that information to benefit themselves enough to pass a class.

Basically prezi is a presentation software, meant to rival powerpoint.  It doesn't use slides, but instead has one 'canvas' that you put a bunch of things on.  It is great for conceptual things like flow charts, and is a really neat program.  A professor at my university was using it in a presentation she was giving about when she went to South Africa for a year to help reform the university system there.  It was one of the coolest presentations I've seen in a while. 

There is a free version, as well as a paid version  The free version has limited storage space, and makes all presentations made public, as well as a few other inconveniences.  For example, I am not yet sure if you can export these presentations for use in offline mode without the paid subscription, and that would limit the number of presentations you could make (so for example you may not be able to make a year's worth of presentations due to storage limitations and not being able to save them to a flash drive or hard drive).  I am not sure about this, I just have been messing around with it for a few hours.

 It is definitely an interesting tool to mess around with and worth checking out though.

I just finished the first version and my family really loves it but I am having a hard time getting a bigger group to try it and give me feedback.  Right now it scans tests and inputs the scores directly into your gradebook.  It is focused on multiple choice grading and automatically scans and grades that type of test.

We have two small kids. She has taken on almost every extra curricular activity she can, and is in her classroom till after 5 every school day. She is a very hard worker, sometimes too hard. She is tired every night when she comes home and many times watches too much tv, or falls asleep because she's overwhelmed with work.


She is telling me that the semester is coming to an end and cannot focus on correcting the hundreds of papers she has and needs to get a hotel room for the weekend to correct them because she can't focus at home.
I know what you are thinking and **there is zero worry in my mind about any shenanigans or foul play.**

She claims that teachers for the first few years are overwhelmed and that I need to be more receptive to that.

My argument is that she bit off more than she could chew with the amount extra curricular groups that she took on, and that she is using me to be on full parent duty while she takes a break to correct papers. 

Her argument is that she has tried it before and that she can't focus at home.

I offered an alternative, which was to take the kids away for the weekend to give her the space and quiteness to do what she needs to do.
I am now the jerk for saying that I don't approve.
So the questions are...

All throughout my academic career and even in my professional life, I am drawn to situations in which I am tutoring or educating other people. I've been told by several classmates and a few professors that I should look into teaching.

Some background: Currently 28, started college at 24 and will finish in 2 years with a BA in Illustration and a minor in Writing.

My question is about tattoos. I have two 3/4ths sleeves. Nothing on my neck or hands and nothing offensive by any means.

How much do you think this would affect my ability to get a teaching job at a college level? I know at a high school level I would be required to keep them completely covered, but if I am teaching in college it seems like in Art or English, the rules would be much more lax.

I'd really be bummed out about entering a field again where I had to completely cover myself head to toe even on 90 degree days.


**edit: so let's open this up to questions about teaching high school then. Obviously I'd have to keep them covered non-stop while IN the school.

The kids really try to test my limits, so I enjoy hearing about new ideas that work.

One of the things I saw today were metal rings with laminated green, yellow, and red cards. Each student had a set on their desk. When they did not need help and were doing fine with their work, their cards were on green. If the student had a question, they would flip their card to yellow and leave it face-up on their desk. When they were done with the assignment and ready to move on, they flipped the card to red.

This made my day so much easier. I was able to see who needed help easily and make my way around the classroom without students trying to jump out of their seats to come talk to me. Simple, but effective.

I've done well for someone in my 20's I would say...own a house, married a beautiful girl and have a nice car.  But this whole time I've known something has been missing.  I don't fit in with the business world, and I can't feel my impact on society.  I'm not too concerned about bottom lines or product growth because I know that in the grand scheme of things it doesn't really matter.  Over the last 9 months I've been really miserable coming to work, feeling like I'm only doing this for money and don't feel passionate.

So I decided that this year is the year to start making a change.  Growing up, I
Loved school and did well in all subjects, I still read about history and science etc in my spare time.  So I thought to myself, education and life long learning is something I really enjoy, why not make it my life's goal to impart that on others?

My wife is a phys Ed/science teacher and loves her job, has been teaching full time almost since graduation. It's wonderful to see and hear her enthusiasm.  I think I can have that too.  So today I enrolled in Open Studies at my alma mater to take some history classes, and have applied to the education after degree program for fall 2014.

I've never really taught anything before, and never have worked with kids.  So I think I'll use this year to volunteer and discover more about myself.  I may be an idealist, but what I've been doing with my life until now hasn't given me anything but nice things and an empty feeling from Monday to Friday.  I'm ready for a lifestyle change and to make kids my focus and passion.

I feel as though it will be a good life for my wife and I as well once I become established.  Have summers off together to travel and backpack around the world is a shared goal of ours (we don't want kids of our own).

Hopefully in a few years I will look back on this post and be proud of myself for making a positive change!

This is a little rant because I need to get this off my chest to a group of people who actually understand the bullshit behind this.

I'm beginning my 5th year teaching.  I was excessed from my last school because last in, first out and the budget wouldn't allow for another English teacher.  No worries.  I had many job interviews and accepted a leave replacement position at a school about a week ago.  The school year starts this Tuesday.  It's Friday prior now.

YESTERDAY, I get a call from this school telling me that the position was made perm and that they chose to rehire someone they excessed 2 years ago who had an appointed position at another school AND who turned them down a year ago for a leave replacement position.  In other words, I turned down other interviews and offers because I (foolishly?) believed I had a job with them, only to be told two days before the school year to, essentially, fuck off.  

I've been assigned to a random NYC school that neither wants me or needs me, to be a ridiculously overqualified and glorified babysitter.  Some people wouldn't mind getting paid to substitute, but I'm a really good teacher and I just feel like I'm being wasted.

Thanks for commiserating.

EDIT:  Thanks for the kind words everyone.  It's always helpful to get an empathetic ear.  My situation is definately better than being unemployed or underemployed.

She teaches 6th grade at a local middle school that just revoked bathroom privileges during class. We can't seem to agree on the subject, so I would like to know what r/teaching thinks!

Without going into too much detail, the basic argument goes like this. One or more kids decided it's a good idea to vandalize the bathroom on a semi-regular basis. Not in just the usual ways, but also by smearing waste on the walls, stuffing entire unused tubes of toilet paper into the toilets, and other pretty awful stuff.

She thinks, given the severity of the situation, that limiting bathroom privileges to the 5 minutes in between class is justified. I can understand that view, and may have been tempted by it if it were my place to solve this problem, but I don't agree with it at all and certainly would never implement such a policy.

On the other hand, I think the ability to relieve yourself whenever the urge arises is a basic physiological need, maybe even a human right. I've done my homework and found plenty of court cases and other sources that agree with this view. My problem is, I don't know of any alternative solutions. Taking away their daily 20 minute break wasn't effective, but it rarely is. There are security cameras pointed at the entrance to the restrooms, but I don't know how to pinpoint who's doing this besides having someone check after each student leaves. Certainly not a viable idea, that one.

I desperately want to write to the principal and have this policy revoked, but I expect nothing will happen unless they're provided with an alternative, and that's where I'm stuck. Is the way I'm thinking about this completely backwards? What do you think?

EDIT: Just to clarify, it's only the 6th grade girls' bathroom that's had this problem, but this has been introduced as a school-wide policy. P.S. Thank you all for you input, it's been extremely helpful!",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,True,,,True,t3_pgwe1,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/pgwe1/what_does_rteaching_think_of_limiting_bathroom/,

So I just graduated with my B.S. in Elementary Education and was hired as a sub for a few different districts in my region. I had a few questions about standard sub procedures and etiquette.... especially how to find/figure out the lesson plans the teacher wants taught while he/she is gone.

Anyway, questions I have as a sub:  

1) What should I expect when I arrive? Do teachers usually leave plans and how detailed are they usually? Are ever kept in the teacher's desk or filing cabinet, and is it acceptable for me to go through the teacher's desk to find them? Or are they usually left out in plain sight? I've heard that the office sometimes supplies the teacher's lesson plans... How does a sub get lesson plans at your school/in your classroom? 

2) What if I can't find the lesson plans? Should I just try my best to build upon/continue the previous days' lesson plans, if they're written down in the weekly planner? (For example: How do I figure out lessons for classrooms with veteran teacher who never write anything down because they have all the lessons in their heads?)

3) In cases where there are no plans or there isn't a workbook/textbook to follow for a subject, what is an acceptable activity to do with the class?

* Future generations don't stand a chance. My teacher asked the kids to hand in a little written assignment, and the spelling on these sheets were worse than texting. I saw ""ima"" written a few times (short for I'm going to) and it almost made me cry.
* Either from summer or from being scared of high school, kids are silent on the first day. My teacher said it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to say anything.

He was injured in an explosion and went through physical rehab and therapy for quite some time before being medically discharged.  I believe he has some PTSD issues, but he has never came right out and said it, and it's not my place to ask.  I'm not sure that's even relevant, but since I don't know, I mentioned it.


This man is one of the hardest workers I've ever met in my life.  At least in the top 3.  He works harder, wastes less time, and does tasks more thoroughly than anyone else on the payroll, hands down.


The problem is that he's absolutely *lousy* at following directions, either verbal or written.  For a simple example, I told him ""You're going to be making 3 batches of this sauce.  Each batch gets 6 cups of *X*, 6 cups of *Y*, and 1 cup of *Z*.  Here's 3 empty jugs, a measuring cup, and a funnel.  Just pour the ingredients for each batch into the jugs and shake them up.""  First of all, he started to make it on the stove, thinking it had to be cooked.  I stopped that, and reminded him that he just needed to pour the stuff into the jug and shake it to mix, no cooking.  THEN, he thought I meant that the 6cups/6cups/1cup was the TOTAL amount of the ingredients, enough to make all 3 batches, instead of understanding that those were the ingredients for each individual batch.


I feel like I was pretty clear.  Most other people I have worked with or trained, I wouldn't have had to even go into as much detail as that.  And that is the simplest recipe we make here at our restaurant, too.  There are many many other examples.


I know that one technique could be to give him his instructions, and then ask him to repeat them back to me to make sure he understands, but I have a hard time figuring out how to word or phrase that command.  This man is about 20 years my senior, has fought for our country, seen the world, etc. etc.  It is not my intention to make him feel like I'm talking down to him, or treating him like he's stupid.


Any suggestions about how to approach that, or any other suggestions as to ways to alter my training approach?  Or any speculation about what kind of LD he might have (just for my curiosity)?


I did not see an actual learning disability subreddit, or I would have posted this there.  I felt like the actual /r/disability subreddit wouldn't be very well suited to learning disabilities, I figured they're more geared towards physical disabilities.

You can't teach someone to have a good personality or good work ethic, but you can teach them skills.  This guy has a pretty decent personality, and like I said, some of the strongest work ethic I've ever seen.  I have a lot of respect for him because of that alone, not to mention his veteran status or what he went through.

I think I'm honestly just worn out with school. I'm like those stupid college senior memes. :/

Did anyone else feel like this and once they got a job it all changed?

P.S. I'm sick of hearing that there is no jobs for teachers. Why am I majoring in secondary math education and minoring in K-12 TESOL if there are no jobs?

**EDIT**: Thank you to everyone that is giving words of advice and support. It's helping a little. As I said to someone below,

I think what's making me feel so bad is this TESOL class I'm in this semester. It's a theory class (I have the methods class next semester). The professor is tenure and the head of the TESOL department. He doesn't teach. His form of teaching is

1) Read the chapter

2) Ask students if they have questions on the chapter

3) Yell at them if they don't because no one has the book yet

4) Hand out a study guide with the following criteria

-Study the book in depth

-Seriously

I mean this guy doesn't teach! I have an exam tomorrow and who knows how I'm going to do on it because it's mostly essay questions. He wants us to memorize every damn vocab word along with every Theorist in the book. I'm just beyond stressed with this class.

I went to one interview that lasted 40 minutes and had some tough questions, but I ended up doing really well. Not 20 minutes ago, I had a second interview with three ""parents"" (who I later found out were teachers) from the community. This one was supposed to be a walk in the park from what everyone else told me. A few softball questions, handshakes, etc. Well it was going okay until one of the teachers asked me how I would react to an unruly parent, via role playing. I essentially said something along the lines of, ""It's your responsibility as well as mine to be a part of their educational process."" This was 5 minutes into the interview. The remaining 10 minutes were spent telling me how I was wrong, uppity, too young to understand, etc. It was a nightmare.

Help me synthesize what happened and turn it into a learning experience. How off base am I? I do understand where they are coming from. I'm usually an empathetic person anyway, but this doesn't get through to everyone. They also specifically critiqued my use of the word responsibility. Isn't it just that though?

Teacher here.  I was wondering what you guys thought about explicitly teaching students that there is no evidence that god exists.  Is that necessarily a violation of separation of church and state?  Yes, I understands that it may cause a lot of controversy because it is a core belief.  However, religion may be blocking social progress (something that I think a school is responsible for) in the areas of gay marriage, stem cell research, gender equality, understanding evolution, etc.  Thus, wouldn't it be relevant, if not necessary to debunk supposed truths that students have learned in the past?  

Would simply saying, ""Based off the current evidence presented to us by peer reviewed data, there is no evidence that god exists.""  If a school were to retaliate, would I have the moral/legal high ground?  Would it be legal for schools to fire me for stating facts?

I feel like this is a logical conclusion.  Am I just a crazy person? ... well I am a teacher...

::EDIT::  Thank you all for providing different perspectives that I didn't take into account before.  I think I really need to clarify that I will NOT be doing this in the classroom.  I teach students with moderate to severe disabilities and I do not think that this level of thinking is appropriate for them. 

Second, I really didn't mean to offend anyone in this forum and I appreciate that r/teaching exists.  I should have put this in r/atheism.  Please do not turn away from what could be such an invaluable resource for teachers.  I'm sorry.  

Last (and hopefully this provides a clearer map to my logic): Some famous atheist once said that the sanctity of religion may be dangerous (saw it in reddit somewhere).  Why does religion get a special pass from facts?  If I am trying to teach about the criminal justice system I would teach about capital punishment.  Many people have strong beliefs about capital punishment, but is it wrong for me to challenge them with the truth?  I am obligated to teach students facts.  And in teaching facts, I have to demystify them of myths that they may have heard.  For example, some may think that life in prison is more expensive than capital punishment (it’s not).  Some may say that capital punishment deters crime (it doesn’t).  So I HAVE to correct any misconceptions they may have even though it may conflict with personal beliefs.  What if I told my kids, ""Based off the current evidence presented to us by peer reviewed data, there is no evidence that thetans (Scientology term) exists.""

That seemed strange.

I wrote him a nice message: Please explain what Biblical principle you were talking about regarding teacher pay?

His response, and I quote: ""No, that is not what I meant. That's media for you.""

Well, I didn't say what I said he meant. I had the quote of what he said; I wanted to know where in the Bible he thought it said to keep teacher pay low.

So I called his office. Very nice lady and I talked and I just asked her to pass along my greeting (he doesn't have voicemail. This is a state senator in the United States and he doesn't have voicemail?)

So I sent the following e-mail:

""Please, then, explain. I'm not a constituent, I'm just a voter, a Christian and a teacher. I don't mean to be rude and I am sure you have other things to do, but I really want to know what part of the the Bible influenced you to make that statement. If you were misquoted by the media, please explain that.""

After a day, this is what I got:

""The underlining theme of my message that day was balance. **God said he weighted the hills and valleys on a scale when he created this world and why? Because he new that it would be spinning real fast and need to be in balance.** I said that Legislators don't need to make to much and they don't need to make to little both can lead to corruption and likewise **with teachers to raise someones children 8 to 10 hours a day I believe requires a calling and if you doubled a teachers pay  you would attract people who don't need to be teaching our children**. Never the less if you don't pay them enough then they might not enter the profession which calls for balance. Balance is the Biblical principle. I have also said many times that I hope and pray that the economy turns around in the near so that the state can afford to give teachers at ;least a cost of living raise.Legislatures were offered one last year and all republicans in the senate turned it down, not so with the other party. We knew teachers haven't received classroom money for several years and even though the ETF was critically low we still gave $134.00 to every classroom. I also gave all of my community grant money to be used only for classroom supplies. The cuts we made last year, we were asked to make these cuts by none other than your faithful association the AEA. Blame them or thank them for the cuts.In reguards to retirement I did make a light hearted statement to a gentleman at the meeting and I owe him an apology. Would love to hear your response and God bless""

Now, I think he's referring to Isaiah 40:
A voice of one calling:
“In the wilderness prepare
   the way for the LORD[a];
make straight in the desert
   a highway for our God.[b]
4 Every valley shall be raised up,
   every mountain and hill made low;
the rough ground shall become level,
   the rugged places a plain. ""

I had an up and down first semester of teaching, mostly because of persistent classroom management issues that I could not figure out how to solve. Namely, students consistently talk over me during lessons and if I, for example, ask them to work on something quietly, they talk the whole time. I feel like my issues stem from a lack of respect for me by my students, and I want to know if there is a way to fix this going into the 2nd semester.

Here is what I tried first semester:

1) Giving discipline points to misbehaving students. The school uses a points system that adds up for each student and awards consequences like detentions, Saturday detentions, suspensions etc.

2) Awarding positive points; The opposite of the discipline points. These take discipline points away and can even put a student into positive territory

3) Awarding after school detentions

4) Towards the end, I tried changing the way the class was run. We have block scheduling, so I felt that maybe if I added more transitions and activities, students would be less bored and more likely to stay focused. Instead of having 30-40 minutes of notes followed by guided practice and an activity for the rest of class, now we might do notes for 15 minutes, an activity for 25, another activity for 30, and then practice. Basically, keep the class moving from thing to thing.

5) making behavior part of their grade. Behavior was a component of a ""class grade"", which was the equivalent of one test grade. I graded them on things like preparedness for class, participation, dress code, as well as behavior and factored all of these things into the grade.

I am planning on having another ""first day of school"" with my students to try to reset expectations. However, I am concerned that students will not take this seriously since they do not respect me like they should.

I popped out the other door and approached him as he was leaning down to shout to kids walking by. HE started walking away and I followed him.  He would not face me, so I got ahead of him- he turned around, I did it again, all waiting for my phone's camera to start working. 'Where are you going?"" I asked. ""Counselors Office,"" he said. I took a quick shot of his back and the side of his face; I was going to ask Security to bring him by when I wasn't teaching.


2nd period? I hear someone loudly repeating the word 'fuck' over and over again outside my room. Lo and behold, it's the kid and he's transferring into **my class**. I confront him about what he did earlier (wandering the halls to disrupt classes, trying to duck my id'ing him) and what he was doing just now. He doesn't want to make eye contact, but I've got a way about me, so he sees I'm for real, says he'll be good.


I seat him in the front row near me. The kid next to him is wearing a Raiders cap. It's against dress code, so I tell him to remove it. The new kid starts repeating 'The Raiders are traitors! The Raiders are traitors!' until I ask him to explain what he's saying. It's about the Raiders, he says. I tell him to stop and redirect his attention to the board and the work.


About ten minutes later, I had moved to teaching the Declaration of Independence on the board (this is an 11th grade class, but made up of kids who don't have the basic skills and haven't passed the High School Exit Exam.) New kid is almost feverishly looking down the rows, trying to make eye contact with some one. I half-turn my back. HE sees this, leans down and pretends to LOUDLY SNORT A LINE OF COKE OFF OF HIS DESK, then turns and looks at the class, smiling and nodding as if to say 'we can do this, let's do this, let's get this done.' 


I don't even pause in my instruction. I am on autopilot: I go to my desk, make notes on what he did and go back to the board, still working like a boss.
After class, we discuss his mistakes. He tries to say 'my bad,' and I explain that we're not rappers and that this is a little more serious than he thinks- does he realize that I assume that he's carrying drugs? Right now? I tell him to wait for a call and we'll try again tomorrow.


He is the last to leave the room. A kid from the next class comes in and says, hey, is that kid in your class?

He insists he knows the material. I'd like to show him his tests with his answers and his grade. I think he needs to see that whether or not he knows the material, he needs to be able to show he knows the material by passing tests.

I want to go over his answers with him and show him they were not correct and that is why he has the grade he does.

I think giving him a second chance to retake tests/quizzes would show he doesn't have to do things right the first time.

A little history on [my son]: Up until August of last year he lived with his mother in Washington. He's had very little supervision and boundaries until he and his sister were transferred to my custody. Last year, we went through the same issues. 

He has not been reliable with getting his homework done and bringing home what he needs to. He is extremely reluctant to do homework or study at all. He may well attend summer school after this year but for now I need to show him you and I are not divided about what he needs to do.

He needs to see he is required to complete his work or pay the price, both in his grades and a loss of his free time. He also needs to see it doesn't come easily. He views studying as something you do when you don't understand something, not necessarily what you do to go over material again before a test.

I can understand I've given you a lot to take in. I expect you have a few hundred students to worry about. For now, I only have one student to worry about and I need your help.

I've been having issues accessing the school's blackboard system. That should be resolved today. I'll use that to keep an eye on what he should be doing at home, especially when it comes to studying before tests.

The sooner I can show where he's not measuring up, the sooner I can hold him accountable.

The teacher loves me, so I'm doing well in that department.

I think the kids are starting to take a liking to me, they love to play, give me random hugs, but they still don't listen very well. Do any of you have any tips for making kindergardeners listen and follow instructions?


I love them in the classroom. But I have to take them to the bathroom (all 27 of them, boys and girls, bathroom on opposite sides of a long hall) by myself. That and the playground.... are absolute hell. I'm thinking of getting a whistle for the playground...

I don't even want to start talking about lunch.

I lost my voice this first week, it's gone, my throat got so scratched up that I ended up getting an infection and now I think I have a cold. I've had a fever all day...

I'm 20, no kids. I only babysat before. I love kids... but I feel completely destroyed. While it gradually got better as the week went by, I still feel like the kids did a number on me. (mostly because I don't know how to handle them, of course)

Any tips... advice? Is this first week thing normal? (especially since I just got thrown into it 30 something days into the school year)

Thanks everyone!

**EDIT:** Thank you so much everyone! This is all great advice that I'll be sure to put into practice on monday! While it's a hard first job, I'm overall content and happy to be working with these younglings. I think I'm going to go lay down and take some medicine, I don't wanna get the kiddos sick on monday. ): So I gotta get better! :D

I'm in a weird situation now where I work as an ELA and Science Interventionist. Can't say I've really been enjoying the experience of co-teaching; at least for my ELA class.

It was clear this guy didn't want me in his class and I really should've paid attention to the red flags from the start. Frequent lateness, not getting the lesson plans to me on time, only giving me the student materials and not the teacher materials, not defining my role in the class, etc.

Our classes are the most consistently out-of-hand, and when we had a meeting to deal with these issues he kept shifting the blame onto me, even though I don't lead teach and do the bulk of the teaching. Our meeting with the principal he managed to spin it around to being about me (damn lawyer background of his).

Some of the other teachers at the school do know the situation and know that I basically got thrown into an awful situation with a guy who doesn't care and admitted that he's just doing this for the experience so that he can take that with him when he enters politics. They gave me some good advice, like documenting what's happening so that I can give more concrete examples during the next meeting.

Which should be soon. It hit the fan today when he gave me one instruction in private and then told me to do the opposite of that in front of the kids. Later he ended up screaming at the kids, putting them on the spot, telling them to shut up, getting into a student's face and arguing back at her, it was horrible. I'm waiting on the principal to get back to me now that I have documentation of the day and hopefully we won't have a repeat of how he spun this on me.

I'm mostly just stunned by what happened today.

I have an idea, and I'm not sure if it's wonderful or tragic.  I could see it going either way, so I thought I'd come to you wonderful folks here at /r/teaching and see if I couldn't get some outside perspectives.

Here's the basic premise: It's a research paper that involves studying the infrastructure of a particular historical time/place (Ancient Egypt, Colonial America, Renaissance-era France, etc.) and using that knowledge to write a Zombie Survival Guide for that era and location.

Research elements include (but aren't limited to) population density, transportation, proliferation of information, public health, disease treatment/response systems, religious influence, etc. -- anything that they might find relevant for such a goal.  For their sources, they would use a mixture of academic material and books such as *The Zombie Survival Guide* by Max Brooks.

The research segment would be its own assignment (called a Threat Analysis Report) that they would complete before starting the larger assignment, mostly to ensure that they *have* done at least a modicum of research.  

Critique would be formatted as disaster reports, framing potential improvements as various disasters as their scenario unfolds, not unlike a roleplaying game.  This would still include practical information such as points scored (or deducted), but would hopefully convey the information in a more interesting, thought-provoking way.  

A student who fails to address a high population density might receive one such comment: ""Any hope of mass evacuation quickly dissolve as the tangled, panicked crowds devolve into a violent mass over the last few horses.  Before long, most of [city X] falls to the flesh-eaters.""

The idea I'm working with is that the *presentation* of information isn't as important as the *acquisition* and *application*.  Students who are uncomfortable with the notion of a ""silly"" research paper would, of course, be given the opportunity to do a more formal report.

Is this pie in the sky?  Does the idea intrigue you?  Unnerve you?  Make you want to throw up in your mouth a little?  I only have a single year of Composition under my belt, and while most of my odd ideas were well-received, I'm not so vain as to think I'm the end-all-be-all.  The value of an outside perspective can never be understated.

I've had some tough classes and while I've never called any child a name or tried to belittle them, I've managed to make two children cry. 

The first was a second grade girl. I was trying to hold a story time, and she kept fussing with the teacher's desk/materials after I asked her not to. I told her in a stern voice to sit back down at her desk and she complied, putting her head down. 

During the next part of the lesson, she refused to pick her head up and take the worksheet. I let her be. This turned out to be a mistake, as she would not even pick her head up and get in line for lunch time, and I had to ask a teacher next door to talk to her.

The second was a first grade boy. I had foolishly misunderstood a teacher's lesson plan and let the children pick their own reading groups. For the next rotation, I announced that I would be changing up the groups somewhat. I acknowledged that this was not how their teacher did it, but that was how it was going to be today. This boy, who had been disruptive all day, continued to yell at me. I raised my voice in response and repeated that this was how it was going to be. He put his head down and cried. 

This time I immediately walked over, got down to his level, and tried talking to him. I apologized for raising my voice, and tried to connect with him. No response, and he stayed that way for the rest of the lesson.

I've tried the talking quietly trick to little success; students have just ignored me. I regularly do the old ""everyone clap once, clap twice"" thing, which works fairly well. With older kids I have no problem with writing down names, and sending them to the office after three strikes. That has worked better, but it seems like overkill to send a six year old to the office.

I've spent the last two years working on a computer program inspired by the touch screen interfaces on Star Trek.

**Touch Control System (TCS)**: A 3D game engine built for home automation, electronics projects, and more!

link: [http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/tcs](http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/tcs)

We are going to release an educational version of this software for free! 

Our hope is that by providing a hands-on learning experience with computer graphics and electronics hardware, we'll be able to spark the imaginations of future engineers.

We are working on several ""cool"" tech demos that we hope students of all ages will enjoy.

Here is a WiFi controlled robot:

Launching model rockets:
[http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/blog/launching-rockets/](http://hyperplaneinteractive.com/blog/launching-rockets/)

We can fly model helicopters around with TCS and recently added support for the [NeuroSky Mindwave](http://neurosky.com/Products/MindWave.aspx).

Using this program can get extremely technical and we plan to provide tutorials and instruction for everything from processing 1's and 0's to full-blown 3D graphics and user interaction. Any skills developed here will translate to other platforms and technologies easily.

Our plan is to get on Kickstarter to fully fund the development of this project.

Would any of you be interested in helping with the educational aspect of this project? We would love to work with anyone interested to develop structure for lesson plans, tutorials, tests, workshops, and anything else that would be useful in a learning environment.

We also need messages from educators stating the importance of this kind of hands-on learning and general ""Thumbs up! This is awesome!"" quotes that we could use for marketing purposes.

We're open to any comments or suggestions and welcome any questions or support!



Thanks for everything Teachers!

What do I do?",MissBurlesque,14,0,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/14ms6f/im_currently_working_toward_my_degree_in/,"So, I'm in my first year of the elementary education program and I absolutely love it. I've always worked with kids and I'm so happy with where I'm headed. However, I am involved in the burlesque community on the side; i.e. performing, attending shows, volunteering, etc.

What I'm worried about is whether I can maintain this hobby while pursuing a career in teaching. 

I've gotten some concerned messages from family and friends who are already in the program, warning me not to post ANYTHING, even a status related to burlesque onto Facebook (although my privacy settings are all set up). However, the people who I have talked to who are already teachers seem less worried about it. I'm getting a lot of mixed opinions.

What are your thoughts? Ultimately I want to continue doing this, but it would be nice to see what others think.

For those who don't know what burlesque is, here's a link to a good (but kind of long) descriptor. http://savageminds.org/2012/09/24/the-anthropologist-in-the-museum-what-is-burlesque/

TL;DR: I'm a burlesque performer that is going into elementary education and is worried about possible negative implications. 

Edit: I don't know if it makes a difference, but I will be a teacher in B.C., Canada. :)

Edit: I'm not determined by any means to have an online presence, I was just using Facebook as an example of how some people in my life are concerned about me keeping this as private as possible.

The more I reflect on the year, the more it troubles me that there are students I did not reach.

(I know that some simply put forth an appearance of not caring, but I also honestly feel that some of them just did not care about the class at all, unless threatened by their parents.)

I have realized that the students who worked hard for me are the students who would work hard for anyone, because they are intrinsically motivated. What I want to learn more about is how to motivate people, especially the ones who aren't naturally motivated for math or for school in general. Does anyone have any book recommendations? They could be teaching specific books, or even just general books on the psychology of motivating people.

Tomorrow, for one of my classes, we will be attending a job fair sponsored by my University to meet with administrators from all around the state. I was really excited! I've spent a week or so perfecting my resume...because even though I'm not in the job pool yet, I can recognize this great opportunity and the idea of ""playing"" applicant is exciting to me.

Then...I started reading some the ""tips and guidelines"" provided on my school's Career Services website. Essentially, they advise strongly against any display of personality. They state (numerous times) that nothing-except your resume-should stand out in the prospective employer's mind after you leave. Shirts should be white, off-white, or light blue; makeup should be kept to an absolute minimum; 1-2 inch heels should be worn; hair should be neat and combed back; nails should be manicured.

Now, I'm not some sloppy mope--but NONE of the aforementioned qualities really click with me. I pride myself on my personality. I'm a bubbly, smiling, outgoing girl and my aura of friendliness has landed me every job I've applied for up to this point. I can't imagine going to meet with employers and having to ""tone it down."" I want my personality to stick with employers. I want them to remember me as the smiley, excited, and motivated teaching candidate. I don't want to lie about who I am. I wouldn't want to work for a district that would discourage energy and positivity in the classroom. 

The hair thing, too...Not to toot my own horn, but I've got some cute hair. It's a shorter, layered bob and stands out when compared to the slick straight, side bangs of every other girl my age. I get tons of compliments on my hair, and it's something I really like about myself. Am I going to have to cut it off and go for something average/plain/not me?

I don't wear heels. I don't get manicures. I like my shirts bright and fun. I KNOW not all teachers fit the bill that my school's Career Services has laid out, but I'm just looking for some reassurance.

I know this is a huge rant, but someone put my mind at ease. I just had one of those ""oh-my-god-maybe-I'm-not-right-for-this"" moments...and surprisingly, it has nothing to do with my competence in the classroom.

",NiceButNotThatNice,13,1,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/kgeox/i_took_a_longterm_subbing_job_the_day_before/,"I'm sorry if this is an inappropriate place for this, but I don't have anyone in the teaching community that I can ask for advice.

I'll spare you guys the long version of the story, but basically I was hired on very short notice to teach an art class for the first four (or so) weeks of the year. I have subbed before, but this is my first assignment in this district, so I was not previously an X Jurisdiction Public Schools employee. I was told by several administrators and the substitute office that this would not be a problem, and that, while I wouldn't start receiving paychecks until I was officially hired, I would be compensated fully for every day that I worked at the long-term substitute rate. I accepted the job with this understanding and began work pretty much instantaneously.

It took a little longer than the administrators and I had expected to get through the red tape of being hired by XJPS (which is gigantic). I had hoped to have it done last Wednesday, but I was only able to get officially hired yesterday.

Yesterday I had a discussion with one of the administrators and she informed me that they were not going to be able to pay me, at all, until I had an employee number. Even though I was hired yesterday, I won't receive a number until my background check, etc. is complete, so I don't anticipate receiving it until sometime next week. I said that that was not my understanding of our arrangement, and she said that when I started she thought that I would be able to be paid for all of my time, but it turns out it just wouldn't be possible, and that they were sorry. Basically, I wouldn't start accruing wages, at all, until my background check goes through. This also means that I would only end up getting paid for seven or eight days, so I wouldn't even be receiving the long-term rate. In my district, this is a difference of about $1500.

We went around in circles for awhile and. I said that I felt I should inform her that if I wasn't compensated fully for my time that I would take legal action. (In retrospect I know that this might not have been the best idea, even though it's completely true.) I excused myself back to my room to get some planning done, and two minutes later she was in my room telling me that she had been mistaken, and I would get paid for everything after all, so no worries.

Guys, I don't know what to believe here. I love the kids I'm working with and I don't want to leave them until I have to, but every day that I work with XJCS is a day that I could be *definitely* getting paid in my home district (yes, even this early in the year). I plan to write them a letter explaining my understanding of our arrangement (so that there's something in writing), and I plan to draw up timesheets today and have them signed by someone sufficiently important, but other than that I have no idea how to cover my ass.

To add further insult to insult, this is the school district I graduated from. I don't know why that stings so badly, but it does.

This experience has definitely taught me not to take any job ever unless I have something on paper, but I'd prefer not to write this off as an expensive lesson. Any ideas on how to remedy this situation would be most appreciated.

**Update - The assistant principal just came in and asked me to wear a ""volunteer"" badge with my name on it. I said no, but I'm irritated that my name is now on paper next to the word ""volunteer.""**

**Update 2 - The principal came to me today to clarify that he would indeed be able to pay me for all of my time. I'm still planning on writing that letter to get something down on paper, because I don't completely trust anything they tell me anymore. I'm still welcoming advice on how to cover my ass.**",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,True,,,True,t3_kgeox,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/kgeox/i_took_a_longterm_subbing_job_the_day_before/,

We do not have a significant Jewish or Muslim population, so the end of pepperoni pizza served by the school is certain to be noticed by the students. More importantly than that, can faith really be used as a basis for telling students and staff of a charter school (public-funded, free/non-tuition based, state tax dollars at work building) that they cannot bring Pork to school in their own lunch?

I'm currently a social studies student teacher teaching 9th grade global history and 12th grade economics. So far, I love it--my mentor teacher has been a saint (I would not have made it through the last 6 weeks with 2 more to go without her help), and I really do love teaching and interacting with the kids. Some of the kids are a pain, but they're outnumbered by others who really try to work.

All that being said, one thing scares me a little for the future: the prep. I love the classes and the teaching, but the prep is absolutely brutal. I have been told it becomes easier as you do it more, but does it really?! I've found it difficult to break from the take notes, do reading, etc. routine and stuff. I've worked in some activities that have gone over well, but it's been immensely challenging (not that I thought it wouldn't be).

So I guess I'm just asking if prepping for class comes more naturally as your teaching pedigree grows. It's been interesting trying to plan for economics classes as a college senior, but I've pulled it off okay so far...just trying to remain optimistic for the future!

Specifically, going back to school to get a graduate degree.  I've been thinking about it a lot lately, and I have some questions I was hoping maybe some of you guys could help me with.

I know that I'd be successful in school, no doubt.  I know that I could do this, but I have some concerns about whether or not this is the right thing to do.  Graduate school is serious business and a lot of work, so this would mean a HUGE commitment to not just me, but for my family.  This is a life changing decision.  

So, my question to you is: How did you know this was the right thing/fit for you?  

Some background that might help-I currently work at a fantastic school in my town as a noon duty aide.  It's not much, but I enjoy it a lot.  I kinda love it even though it's no way to make a living.  I look forward to seeing all the kids and talking to them.  All that good stuff.  But every time I walk through the doors, I feel like I could do so much more.  I really want to go back to school and become a teacher and make it my life's work.  But I am really afraid to make the commitment and realize half way through that it wasn't what I made it out to be.  Am I looking at this through rose colored glasses?

So, how do you know the difference between loving the *idea* of being a teacher and knowing that this is for sure what you wanted to do?

How did you know?  

I also worry about getting a graduate degree and when it's all over, ending up over-qualified for an entry level teaching position.  I worry about being too old (I'm already 33) and ageing myself out of the applicant pool.  I'm in a place in my life now, where these things I have to seriously consider because this decision will not only effect me, but my family as well.  I don't care about the pay or the hours, I don't care about the politics, I just want a career doing something that I know makes a difference.  

So, teachers of reddit, how did you know that this was what you wanted to do?  When did you become sure that you had made the right decision?  Am I being ridiculous in worrying about some of the things I stated above? 

Thank you for reading all the way through.  Any and all advice is appreciated.

Remember, let's protect the identity of our past and present students/peers and keep our noble profession dignified.

Background: I'm a young, male teacher. I look like one of the students (high school).

""Hot for Teacher Syndrome"":
I'm sure it's my age, but holy hell I deal with so much shit in this realm.  I wont go into detail unless requested.  Of course, nothing terrible has happened.  I am not about to put myself in any position to ruin my dream career.  I should be a leading source on how to handle awkward inappropriate (sometimes sexual) advances effectively.

Lazy Students:
My most insane story with this one: had a student tell me I collected papers incorrectly.  My method: Make sure you turn your homework in to the tray before you leave. His complaint: You need to tell me what I'm turning in, make sure I have my name on it, make sure I turn it in before finishing collecting assignments.  I was one pissed off teacher that day.

Foreign Exchange Students:
It's always awkward when you use an American/English expression and it translates horribly.  I was a little annoyed one period.  Announced to my students not to push my buttons.  A German had a horrified look on her face until I explained what the expression meant.  She let me know that was ""reeeeaaallly perverted"" in German.

Windows:
Curse them!  They cause any child to have instant ADD when a bird flies by or the weather changes.  One period I had to stop class while students watched a helicopter for 10 minutes.

Creepers:
Students are weird, weird individuals.  They are, for whatever reason, extremely interested in personal lives of their teachers.  At least in my case.  I threaten them the first day they meet me to leave me alone on social networking sites.  Nevertheless, I've had a student take it as a challenge to get my cell phone number.  Very few teachers have this number and I teach in a town few people know me (I commute 30 miles).  She somehow managed it!

The Lounge/ Staff Room:
Clean your shit out of the fridge.  I spent a good 20 minutes of my prep cleaning month old food out of dishes and the fridge.  One had a mysterious liquid and what appeared to be soggy cake floating around in it.  Made the room smell like vomit.

Last year, the last few months were devoted to review. I gave the kids several past year tests to take home and do. One student was turning in FRQs that were very similar to the published results (which are readily available online). It was very obvious to me that he was looking up the answers (not showing enough work; writing things out differently than we had in class) but he denied it. He said that his grandfather had helped him.

I decided not to press the issue, because the AP test would show the truth. And he got a 1. 

But, he is signed up for BC calc for next year. Not only do I think he doesn't have the background to move on, but I don't want to reward this behavior.

I've been there for a little over a month and so far there's no end in sight. 

Long story short, I asked one of my students to come back into my room after leaving for her homeroom to clean up a mess at her desk. She didn't want to. I was standing in the hallway, facing down it, between the two classrooms. She was standing near me, facing the door to my room. I put my hand out behind her - NOT touching her - to sort of guide her in, and she turned around, shouted ""get off me,"" and pushed me. 

I was pretty surprised and forced out some inane comment along the lines of ""excuse me, was pushing me really necessary?"" She shouted, very loudly ""I didn't push you, you pushed me,"" and ran out of the building, shouting about how I assaulted her.

Here is what I've done so far: 

* Submitted a disciplinary report according to my school's policies
* Discussed the incident with the student's homeroom teacher
* Discussed the incident with the student's guardian (she is picked up from school, so we were able to talk)
* Discussed the incident with the principal, including the student's allegation that I pushed her

So far I think I'm okay...I have the support of the rest of my team and the administration, and I was able to talk to her guardian before she spent the whole weekend talking about how I pushed her. Is there anything else I need to do to protect myself?

I am 28 years old and am currently working on my teaching certificate. I graduated from university in 2008 and never expected that I would be returning to become a high school teacher. Life happens, however, and I have since realized that teaching is not only probably my best option for utilizing my undergraduate degree, but is perhaps what I ultimately *should* be doing.

That being said, I am frakkin' terrified for my semester of student teaching. Or, rather, I am terrified of not having any income for five months while I complete student teaching.. 

I am in debt up to my ears and live in a small, cheap, awful apartment. For all intents and purposes, I am single (have a boyfriend, but even if it lasts, living together will not be an option), and moving in with either of my parents is not an option. My siblings live states away. I don't have much in the way of money and while I am hopeful of getting some grant money for next year, I am not counting on it. 

Long story short, I really cannot afford to take out more loans, at least not more than I absolutely must, but I have heard that working during student teaching is not necessarily the best idea, either. A young (early thirties) teacher I know told me that while she did have a part time job during her semester of student teaching, she wonders how much better her lesson plans would have been had she not been working. She was also living with her parents. 

I really would like to try to land a teaching job next fall (2012) before I have to student teach in the spring of 2013, but considering my field this is probably unlikely. There were at least two openings in my city this year, but because I had not yet started my certification coursework I did not feel ready to be thrown to the wolves. It would be great, though, to be able to do my student teaching ""on the job."" Once again, however, I am not counting on this. 

So please, if any of you can offer me some insight, advice, or just moral support, I would greatly appreciate it. How did you financially survive student teaching? What options do I have, besides loans, loans, and more loans? How the hell did you get hrough this?? 

Thank you!


Sincerely,


Scared and Poor Future Teacher

I realize the top sounds awful but please give me a moment to explain.  
I have a students who is coming in every day. I can tell she likes to be social, she likes the attention. I suspect this is a defense mechanism because she uses it to distract from tasks that I dont think she understands. She is thus far though very slow on critical thinking, and barely completes her tasks after a lot of prodding and help from myself and my other students. It's clear she is trying to focus, its like she is just out in her own little world. This sounds terrible but she seems like she is constantly high, but I don't think she is. It really looks like dyslexia or some sort of similar learning issue or like maybe she just hasn't woken up yet. She is definitely a strong willed and would be way more bossy I think if she actually understood what was actually happening. Yesterday she deliberately started ignoring me even when I was standing behind her and telling her to do something I needed from her. I do not ""yell"" at my students unless they do something stupidly dangerous. Even if it takes extra time I try to find a way to reach them and help them clue in to whats happening. I'm trying to find a way to get her excited and paying attention and not ignore when I'm talking to her. I don't want to just give her busy work to get her out of the way, I want to find something that has immediate feedback and helps wake her up and gets her going. Does anyone have any ideas?

Just for background I volunteer 10-20+ hours a week on top of a demanding full time job. I lead a technology outreach program team of 40+ students and work with about 20 individually on different days during the week on 3D animation, website, leadership, and chairmen's awards. The main group I lead has 5 students in it who complete 3d animations in 4-5 weeks. Its a very hard subject and we have major atrition every year but I think these students are staying. I'm used to taking a highly complicated course that takes college kids about 12 weeks and turning it into projects they can get through. Its hard, its really hard. We have only a few resources and I put a lot of money into it. All of the kids are very different. Some come from AP/Honors classes, home schooled students, and others are from schools where they can barely spell their name. I get computers donated or raise the money for them so we can have a lab. Most students don't have computers of their own so sometimes there is a lot of computer literacy that happens as well.

**TLDR: I volunteer and I have a student who acts like she is high but she isn't. The situation is getting worse and I want to find a way to get her excited and involved instead of her own little world. Any suggestions are appreciated.**

1318089357.0,12,self.teaching,l560r,Everything I needed to know I learned in the US Marine Corps - I hope.,,15,3,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/l560r/everything_i_needed_to_know_i_learned_in_the_us/,"I'm teaching a couple of after school music enrichment classes to elementary school kids in an inner-city type situation.  Many of the children probably have ADD/ADHD and difficult home lives, and as a result seem to have difficulty keeping focused on an idea for more than a couple minutes at a time.

The first class was a train wreck.  The kids were all over the place, messing around with their chairs, playing with stuff from their backpacks, getting into my stuff (which I'd said was off limits), talking over each other and me, touching each other - typical for little kids I guess but impossible to get a word in edgewise.

So I decided to use some of the techniques I'd observed (read: been subjected to) in Marine Boot Camp.

I stacked the chairs in a front corner of the class, seats facing the wall, and had the kids put their backpacks in the other front corner of the class.  I wrote their names on pieces of masking tape and placed these in a circle on a floor, with the loudest kids next to me and the talkers separated from each other by the shy kids.

I've heard that the best way to keep any class engaged is to move quickly but in small increments.  To do that, I needed a way to bring the focus onto me *before* the kids got distracted.  So I just used the old ditty from boot camp.  I started by getting them to listen: ""when I say, 'EARS,' you shout ""OPEN!"" and open your ears and listen to me.""  We practiced this a few times: ""ears"" ""mumblemumble"" ""no, I said EARS"" ""earsmumble"" ""try it again - EARS!"" ""open"" ""again, EARS!"" ""OPEN!""  

Then I did the same thing but with ""EYEBALLS!"" ""CLICK!"" and they're supposed to look at me.  Always in that order: ears-open. eyeballs-click.  The rhythm of the syllables are important: one, one two, one two, one.  This helps the kids hear the difference between the two commands.  We worked on sitting down and standing up quickly, ""Ready.... sit! - DROP LIKE A ROCK!"" and they all come crashing down.  ""Ready.... stand! - UP!"" and we worked on this for a while.  The last thing I introduced was ""Hands - DOWN"" where they put their hands behind their backs.

In between each of these steps, I taught the kids different rhythms and had them drumming on their knees.  Any time their eyes started to glaze over just a little bit, I'd have them run to the back wall and then to their spots.  ""5.... 4... 321 stop! - FREEZE"" and they'd stop in place, then I'd have them walk back to their positions, then it would be EARS EYEBALLS READY SIT EARS EYEBALLS HANDS.  I'd then say, new instructions, and we'd work on the next thing.

It was incredible how easily it came to the kids and how much more control I had over the class.  The hours absolutely flew by last week and I was impressed by how quickly the kids were able to pick up on solfege, rhythms, singing together, and learning very basic dance steps.

Someday, statistically speaking, one of those kids is going to join the Marines.  And he'll hear the Drill Instructors for the first time and think, ""you bastard.""

So, is this a good way to do things?  I realize that in a way it's a sort of mental conditioning - some people call it boot camp brainwashing - but I'm not really able to explain things to the class unless I have their attention.  I'm not a very experienced teacher in the classroom setting - most of my teaching is either instrumental ensemble work where the performers already have a good handle on rehearsal discipline, or in the studio where I'm working with individual students.

Any advice or comments would be absolutely welcome.  And if you steal any of this, just make sure you're consistent with the call-and-response ditties.",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,True,,,True,t3_l560r,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/l560r/everything_i_needed_to_know_i_learned_in_the_us/,

",francesmcgee,12,3,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/kh3oa/i_always_hated_people_like_this_but_im_thinking/,"I graduated college 3 years ago.  I didn't get a teaching job right away, so I subbed, tutored, and volunteered until I got one last year.  I taught 2nd grade for the last few months of the school year.  I didn't really like it, but I thought things would get better if I had my own class from the start of the year. 

Now, I teach first grade at an inner-city school.  I'm about to finish my third week with these students.  I really hate my job. There are a few reasons why, but mostly, I just don't feel like I'm good at it.  My class is out of control.  We have barely done anything academic because I can't get them to stop fighting, throwing things, and talking.  Innocent children are getting hurt in my class because I can't handle 22 six year-olds.  The administration has placed a paid, adult hall monitor in my room for as much of the day as possible, but it doesn't help enough. 

I just don't see it getting better, and it terrifies me to think I will be doing this for nine more months, or worse, 20 years.  The students just don't listen to me.  I do everything to the best of my ability and I feel like it's worse every day. I think a big problem is that I am soft-spoken. I talk as loudly and firmly as I can, but I can hardly get the kids' attention.  Other adults walk in the room and my kids are immediately silent.  I use pretty much the same lesson plans as the other first grade teacher in the building, but that class is doing well. (The kids are on the same academic levels, they are evenly mixed based on test scores and teacher recommendation.)

I also hate that I have had hardly any free time in the past six weeks.  I'm there from at least 7:00am to 4:00pm, then I spend all night/weekend grading papers, calling parents, and planning.  I know it shouldn't take that long, but my attention span is very short, plus I spend a lot of time looking up/researching ways to teach concepts because my own ideas are boring. 

I know what to do.  I listen to other teachers and give them good advice.  I got great grades in college and my Praxis scores were nearly perfect. It's not that I'm clueless, I actually feel pretty competent, it's my delivery that is poor. I am soft-spoken and kind of spaced out.  A lot of times I won't see kids acting up when they really are quite obvious.  I feel like it's stuff that is beyond training. 

As poorly behaved as my class is, I still love my students.  I want what is best for them.  I want them to get out of this dangerous neighborhood they live in.  So fellow teachers, is it better for me to quit now with the hope of them getting a better, more motivated teacher?  Or should I stick it out until the end of the year so they don't feel abandoned?  If I quit, I have to give 30 days notice so they can hire a replacement, but they still might go about 2 weeks without a teacher. 

I wanted to quit before I even started student teaching 3 and a half years ago.  My field experience supervisor told me that she thought teaching wasn't for me (she was kind of a bitch), but my family talked me into sticking with it.  It took me a long time to get hired because I had a hard time getting recommendations.  My practicum didn't go all that well either.  I persevered because that's who I am, but now that I am here I am miserable.

tl;dr  Taught a few months last year.  Just started what could be my first full year of teaching, and I want to quit.  Is it better or worse for the students if I quit?

When the class lined up to go to recess, ""Kevin"" began kissing up to my mom, all 'I love you!' this and 'I'll be a good boy!' that, and gave her a big hug. And then this conversation took place:

Miss Q: I'm happy to hear all that, but you still need to do your punishment and miss most of recess.

Kevin: B-but... I told you I loved you and I hugged you and I said I was sorry!

Miss Q: Well i'm very happy about that and I love you too, but you still have to do your punishment.

The Theory of Knowledge class in particular, as it would be a place where my students can come in their off-time to exchange ideas or discuss class content. ToK is supposed to bridge all of their classes, and I'm looking for ways to make discussion easier and more interesting for them.

I could make a ""clean"" login for myself, set up a private subreddit, and that would be great. What I'm worried about is the rest of Reddit - the potential for time-wasting and Things That Cannot Be Unseen is high, and given that these are high school kids, almost inevitable.

Someone in the IB forums mentioned [Ning](http://www.ning.com/), which looks good but runs at least $25/month. There are [free options](http://www.jonbishop.com/2010/04/9-free-ning-alternatives-and-some-open-source-solutions/), but I don't know how good they are. There's also [phpBB](https://www.phpbb.com/), but that's a little above my skill level, and I have nowhere to host it.

So I turn to you - have you successfully used Reddit as a teaching tool? Have you found alternatives? Is this just an Over-Eager New(ish) Teacher Idea that will only end in pain and suffering, or has anyone had success with this?

We tried to get him to focus more on social studies methods, but he seemed very unclear about what the course was intended to provide. Some peers of mine had taken the same course the previous semester with an experienced university professor, and they raved about how it was the only course that focused on social studies and everything they learned was invaluable.

May I ask for any advice?",teachingthrow,13,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/130siq/i_want_to_teach_but_my_university_has_screwed_me/,"Throwaway because this will inevitably contain a lot of personal information. I apologize if this isn't something you guys can really help me with, but I'm a little desperate for any advice. Sorry for the info dump:

I'm located in the US, in Illinois. When I started at college, it was as a computer engineering major. I liked it and the security it would provide well enough, but it wasn't something I loved and it wasn't something I was particularly great at. By the start of my junior year, I was pretty unhappy. My volunteer teaching work at a local middle school and the Chinese language I was studying were the only things I was actually enjoying. 

After a lot of thought, I met with our advisers in our engineering, education and east Asian language and cultures department. I switched out of engineering for the EALC department's foreign language teaching program, in Mandarin. The way the program is set up, you take a year's worth of courses before you apply into the education part. I've finished all of those classes, and I have genuinely loved all it. It includes early observation in a foreign language classroom, and though they couldn't find a Chinese classroom for me to observe in, I'm enjoying the French class immensely. I really think this is something I want to do, even if it means graduating way late.

After these classes, I should have been able to apply into the teaching program at the end of this semester. The problem is... I got told three weeks ago that they're suspending the Chinese teaching program, and that the one other person in the ""pipeline"" and I are not allowed to apply. Apparently, no one ever made sure that there were *actually* school placements available for Chinese before they created and advertised the program.

I'm left feeling entirely adrift. I've met with a lot of administration, and they said they *might* be able to work something out for the two of us, but that was three weeks ago with no more information. I'm told to get the regular version of the EALC degree, but I wouldn't have switched out of engineering for a cultural studies degree.  

I'm left really wondering where to go from here. I'm a senior in college without any idea. I've met with an adviser, and I'm only told there is one other school in the state that offers a Chinese teaching program, and that I could do it post-graduation. It's private, expensive, and I've heard iffy things. 

If I want to teach Chinese, what's the best way to get certified? Is a master's program the only way to go? I've spent a lot of tuition on classes that are now no longer relevant, but I could try to make it work. I just worry that's a lot more loans on what will be a modest salary, and I've always assumed you get a lot more out of a teaching masters after you've actually been teaching for a while. Is Teach for America an option, or something like it? I've heard mixed things there as well, in addition to them being very selective in who they accept. It doesn't sound like a safe bet. 

**TL;DR My college pulled a degree bait-and-switch on me as a senior, and now I'm left with an unemployable bachelors and a desire to teach a somewhat uncommon foreign language.

The district refuses to budge on a bunch of issues, and the future of the high school is on very thin ice. As any teacher knows, receiving an education is the only thing that can motivate kids and as it stands right now, school will be shut down for the rest of the year. For many of the kids here, this is their one and only chance at success and they may not be able to afford to go to the other surrounding high schools. The teachers on this subreddit know what these teachers are going through, and watching this video will help support their cause. It is important to know that this is ABSOLUTELY NOT ABOUT MONEY. As any of the teachers will tell you, this has nothing to do with money, these teachers actually want to educate students, and they love to do it. They don't need petitions, phone calls, etc. just watching the video will send a message to the district office. If there is any one community that can come together and make something happen, it's definitely the Reddit community. Thanks

With technology and the advent of cloud-computing, it struck me as a bit archaic that there's not really anything out there beyond basic bookeeping. So, being a software dev, I thought I might write her something web-based so she can access it from wherever.

The idea here is to develop a somewhat comprehensive piece of software around lesson plans and tracking progress based on said plans. Beyond just storing ""Assignment, Date, Student Grade"" the software would be able to organize this data, normalize it, and finally visualize it in different types of user-defined reports (histograms, scatter plots, historicals, etc) with the appropriate statistical information.

So stuff like pie charts of assignment types, historical progress of a students grades or participation, distributions of grades and time spent, comparisons on performance between activity A and B, etc.

So the questions I have for r/teaching are:

* Does something like this already exist?
* How useful would something like this be?
* And if it existed, would you use it?

Just a question I've been wondering lately after I had class one day, and reflecting on a chapter I read in Tools for Teaching by Fred Jones. We were talking about how important it is to keep our lessons relevant to students' lives so that they have motivation to do well (basically trying to answer the question ""Why should I?"")

When I teach my ESL classes, the answer to ""why should I?"" is easy... They are adult international students, and they need to learn how to speak English so they can communicate in their every day lives. Now that I'm going into public school teaching and working with mostly native speakers of English, I feel that answering this question will get trickier. I don't want to have my future classroom to be full of apathetic students. Realistically I know not all of my students will be interested in learning English literature and writing essays. 

I'm trying to formulate a better, more concrete answer to ""Why should I?"" Answers from teachers from subjects other than English are more than welcome, just would love to find out how the awesome teachers of r/teaching keep their students motivated so I can too!

However, I am by no means certain that I would get accepted into the program, as I know often they look for highly successful people who will move on to be influential people outside the classroom. Any TFA teachers out there? Are the resources, the training, and the network in which you're connected worth it? Do they put you in no-win situations in the classroom?

Also, getting a master's: Will that make me a better teacher? Easier to get a job? Easier to move onto to administrative work if I desire later?

Thanks!

EDIT: One of the reasons I'm strongly considering Teach for America is that I really believe in their mission of fighting the injustices of inequality and poverty in this country. But I'm interested to see if the best way I can do that is to join TFA or get a credential and work in the same underprivileged neighborhoods. What would lead to more success in the classroom?

Attendance was terrible and suspensions were surprisingly high.  One of my goals for this year is helping my students avoid suspensions and building a positive school culture.  One of the ways I'm looking at meeting these goals is through focusing on consequences that restore what was lost from the classroom without *just* using punishment designed to make a student miserable.  Of course, opting not to participate in the restorative option or abuse of the restorative option would result in the traditional discipline for the issue.

Yes, I know this might be unrealistic sometimes, but we've got to try something new.  

Example: 

Disrupting the classroom during class wastes my time spent preparing for the lesson and draws focus away from the material.

Consequence - The student will submit a mini-lesson plan and teach either the review lesson for the material or another 10-15 minute lesson of my choosing.  

I really want to focus on restoring to the community what was lost and not sending students out.  I know sometimes that's the only option, but I want more choices whenever possible.  Can you help me with restorative suggestions for common discipline problems?

Yay! For the past two years I have been pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I liked computers in high school, thought I'd get a degree in CS and become a master programmer, go on to work at Google or something. Well, as it turns out I don't have the kind of mechanical mind it takes to master the art of computers. I started off doing rather poorly, and thought that if maybe I kept taking more classes and rereading the material, I'd somehow get it. But I didn't.

And for the past semester, I've been wondering whether it'd be better to keep taking computer science classes so the ones I've already taken wouldn't be a waste, or whether I was just beating a dead horse and should try something new. At the same time, I began thinking of teaching as a career. This isn't a case of ""oh, I can't do what I wanted, so I *guess* I'll teach"". Teaching is something I've mulled over as a hypothetical career, but I never gave it any consideration because 100% of my mind was preoccupied with becoming Ms. Programming Nerd. But I have come to my decision.

So after this semester I'll be switching majors to Biological Science and probably pursuing a math minor, while working on the requirements to get into my school's College of Education. 

It's a little scary, and certainly not an ideal situation, because I've got an embarrassing GPA and I've taken lots of classes that won't count towards my new major. I feel like I'm throwing two years of work away, and I know it will be a lot of hard work and probably extra years of college to catch up. The workload itself isn't scary, and it isn't what threw me off-track in the CS department. I just feel like I don't have the right kind of mind to be programming and mastering databases and creating software, but I know that I can teach. At the same time, there's a lingering fear that maybe I'm just really dumb and suck at learning.

And I know teaching won't be an easy career path (my boyfriend's dad taught biology to middle schoolers, I've heard stories!). Again, the hard work is not scary to me; I'm willing and able to work at something I want. I'm just hoping that this is the right thing to do.

I am a hard working student and I get good grades, but I'm wondering what can make me even more marketable.

http://english.chass.ncsu.edu/undergraduate/ltn/ltn.php

It is an English Major with a Concentration in Teacher Education, and provides me with a licensure to teach in my state.  I'm assuming this would supply me with a B.A in English.  Does anyone have experience with programs like this?  Is there anything I should know about this? Also, if anyone went to NC State, any information they could give me about the university, education dept., or english dept. would be much appreciated.

I'm going to start rattling off some questions here, so I'll bullet them. 

* Is a bachelor of arts more or less marketable than a bachelor of ed? 

* Is there any way that I can get certified in both middle (6-9) and High (9-12) school education?   

* Aren't middle school teachers more in demand than high school teachers?   

* Should I consider an ESL certification?  

* How much extra work would this be(ESL), since I only speak one language?  

* What would be the most beneficial minor(s)?  

* Do minors matter at all?  

* Should I consider teaching out of country after college?

* What is the best way to network in college so that I can best open up the possibilities of finding local teaching jobs?

 

* What can I do in college that will help me when I get out into the real world?

I'm a high school senior and I've wanted to be a teacher for a long time.  For a while now, I've been planning to be an elementary school teacher.  However I'm reconsidering that choice for a number of reasons.  One of the reasons I've wanted to be an elementary teacher is because I would get to have my classroom of kids all day, all year.  Instead of just teaching a subject, I would be able to develop better relationships with my students due to seeing them all day.  Another reason I like elementary is because I am not proficient in only one subject.  Since I generally score equally well in math, english, science, and history classes, I figured I should teach all of them!

On the other hand, there are some reasons that are making me reconsider.  First of all, there isn't any jobs in elementary teaching (apparently).  Secondly, I am a male.  The elementary sector is filled with women, and while I don't consider that a problem, it has me worried a little bit.  I'm not sure whether my gender would make me more or less marketable, but I don't want to seem like the odd man out.  Nothing will ever keep me from teaching, but this is one reason that is making me explore other age groups.  Lastly, I don't know if elementary education would satisfy me academically.  I'm smarter than a lot of my friends going into elementary.  All of my friends and relatives that I've talked to have given me surprised looks before asking why I've chosen to work with kids over being a doctor, lawyer, or engineer!   Of course I wouldn't let other people decide what I'm going to do with my life, but it has gotten to me.  I want to do something I love, even if I'm not a stereotypical elementary school teacher.

Like I said earlier, I generally do equally well in all of the subjects.  However, if I was to teach a subject, I would teach English or Social Studies.  Math and science are in demand, I know.  However, I don't know if I could teach math or science for the rest of my life.  I guess I would prefer Social Studies the most out of the four.  How do english and social studies middle school teaching job openings compare to elementary teaching job openings? 

To be clear, I would like to teach 4th or 5th grade *or* 6/7/8th grade social studies or english.  Which of these might be the better option? I understand the answer might be subjective, but I'd still like to hear what teachers of these grades/subjects have to say.

I'm a fairly recent mechanical engineering graduate that's currently got an unsavory job situation. I'm making about the same as most of the teachers I know, and my job satisfaction is practically nil. 

I've always enjoyed teaching. I actually taught throughout high school at a Boy Scout summer camp. I even had to be practically coerced to continue my engineering education at a couple of points. 

Additionally, I'm already planning on heading to grad school in the fall of 2014. So, a change is going to happen. It's just a question of what. I think my best choice would probably just be to continue my education and look for a better job.

I'm also currently considering making the switch to teaching. I have, by no means, decided this is my only course of action, but I'm simply investigating it as a potential path forward.


**My questions are as follows:**

**1. In terms of education and/or certification, what would be required to make this switch?** I know that it would probably depend on location, but I'd like to get a general idea.

**2. Does anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? Would you do it again?**
 
**3. What's the current job market look like?** I moved to a city well outside my university's sphere of influence, and it took me about six months to land the job I've currently got even though my resume was objectively quite good. I had three prestigious internships with research facilities, a high GPA, and plenty of club involvement.

**4. What do you think my biggest surprise would be?**

*TL;DR: My current job situation as an engineer is a serious drain. What would it take to make the switch to teaching STEM classes at the high school level?*

She described how she was named Student Teacher of the Year twice, and how her kids were always respectable.

When asked ""How would you handle a student who is consistently displaying behavioral issues, with no sign of improvement from altered lessons/instruction/etc?""

I have trouble with classroom management with my highschool classes. I made the mistake of starting out nice, so that made things harder. I very much misjudged these kids, and I learned the hard way that there is an urban culture in this school. So now I'm dealing with the consequences and I find it very hard to battle up against that.

My colleages often tell me to be more strict and to stop being too nice to the kids. I understand that, and I really am trying. Maybe I'm weird, but I have a lot of trouble with being (fake) angry and strict toward my students, and people overal. It's exactly the opposite of my personality.

Anyway, I really want to try and improve. I just don't know how, and most books I read are all about how to reach a lot of children in a good way. However, what I need to learn is how to become strict and how to become un-nice, and the books I have don't go into that. Nor did any of the classes in the past four years in college, actually.

I've tried the things I've been taught during college, but these kids don't even care about that, and some of them have a disgusting arrogance which not only baffles me, but I also have no idea how to deal with that.

So, teachers of Reddit, what classroom management tips do you have for me?",,False,self,t5_2qyj9,False,,,True,t3_1axegv,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1axegv/classroom_management_troubles/,

My piece of advice came from my tutor while I was training, and it's something that from the outside seems obvious, but in practice it's not so simple.

Basically, the advice was to make sure that every pupil under your care is made to feel valuable. As I said, this sounds obvious, but often, in one class you'll have pupils who have special needs, and resources need to be geared towards them to facilitate their learning. Similarly, you'll have pupils who have incredible abilities, and they need to be stretched. However, it's so easy to get caught up in making sure these two extremes are catered for, that it's all too easy to just let the 'average' (I hate using that word, but I just mean those who neither need extra help with tuition, nor excel in any great measure) pupils coast through school life feeling undervalued.

I saw a poem on a classroom wall once that I wish I'd written down. It was written from the perspective of a pupil just like that. The poem went on to describe their life in school and how they just plodded on through school and didn't have any great sense of self because they felt they weren't anything special, and it was really powerful. I'll try and find it online and post it if I can, but I don't know who it was written by.

It's the one piece of advice I've always carried with me, and do strive to make sure it happens, but even with the best will in the World, I'll admit, I still don't always get the balance right.

On Friday, my class had a quiz and about halfway through the class period, a student (we'll call her Sally) came up to me saying she didn't understand the material and asked if she could she take the quiz another day.  She had already filled out 3/4 of the quiz (the answers were good, by the way), but she left the vocabulary section completely blank. 

She had been absent one day earlier in the week, but she did not miss any crucial instruction for the material on the quiz.  In fact, she finished the portion of the quiz from the day she missed almost perfectly.  As I mentioned, she was struggling with vocabulary, which we had had for almost two weeks.  

Needless to say, I believe her absence did not hurt her in anyway.  I told Sally that she had to finish the quiz because it is unfair to other students if she knows exactly what words to study.  She went back to her seat, threw down her pencil and quiz and just sat there.  I gave her a minute and then I quietly asked, ""Do you need to go to the office, Sally?""  She ignored me so I asked her again and she spat at me, very rudely, ""Yes! I guess I do!""  I asked her to stay in her seat while I call someone to escort her because at this point, I did not trust her to actually go to the office on her own because she was so angry.

I called Sally's mom at the end of the day and let her know what was going on.  She said she would speak to Sally and let me know how the conversation went.  I just got an email from mom saying that Sally believes she had NO attitude problem whatsoever and that she did not act rudely.  Moreover, Sally said I embarrassed her in front of the entire class (probably because I asked for an escort to the office).  

Mom was supportive and says she doesn't entirely believe Sally because she is a teenager and she asked that Sally and I have a conversation on Monday.  I'm not entirely sure how to approach the conversation because Sally acted very rudely to me and I did not trust her to walk to the office without an escort based on how she treated me in class.  We have had a history of attitude (saying this class sucks, this is stupid, not doing her work, etc.), but apparently Sally does not think she has a problem.  Honestly, before today, I had ignored her snide comments for the most part because I know she has been having some health issues that make her grumpy, but this was too much for me.

I am teaching college for the first time (Intro to Writing-required class for all students in the English department). Anyway, I have lots of experience teaching a variety of age groups, middle and high school classes primarily (remedial classes at that), but I feel like I am struggling a bit. In a unit we do a lot of reading, and then workshop writing until the final paper is due.  We have a set textbook, but other than that, the lesson plans are up to us. I feel that I struggle the most with leading an interesting discussion-I keep asking more primary questions (what happened/what is the significance of this, etc) rather than getting to more significant meaning conversations. I have a teaching circle but what we focus on in that is the more common problem of getting students to talk at all-NOT a problem in my class. I am very thankful to have such a sharp class, but I feel I am not doing them justice. Teachers out there-any ideas of how to bring discussions to the next level?

Edit: I should add that the readings we do are not *about* writing. They are narrative works about a topic. We then respond to the topic those readings address through expository writing.

Just a precursor, I am no expert in teaching; I no longer am one. I taught for two years, and I was an educational technology consultant for one year.    
However, I did some novel things with my 9th graders.  I taught 9th grade RTI on a reservation in South Dakota.  I did a few things that worked well and increased student mastery.

1. I taped my lessons (vodcasting).  This gave students a resource to study; it also helped with absent students.  I just filmed and posted my lecture portion on a website.

2. I had my students blog; I had 20 laptops in my classroom.  This gave me writing samples.  I posted these blogs on a parent site to showcase work and start global discussions.  My students could see their work and words extended beyond my classroom. [Blog](http://futurelakotaleaders.wordpress.com/)

3. I made all my resources, with the exception of books, available on my webpage, Twitter, Facebook, and local server. This made assignments available at all hours to the majority of my students.

4. Most assessments were online.  This gave me real time data on end of unit assessments and formative assessments. It saved me hours of grading.

As I said, I'm a first year teacher and love both teaching and my school so far.  I'm not sad about my kids moving forward; that's what they should do.

However, my contract ends with the school year and I see ahead of me another summer of desperately applying for every job posted and going to interview after interview.  I want so badly to stay at my school, but if there are no positions (not sure yet, but it looks that way), there's nothing I can do but go elsewhere.  I feel like I can't do anything this summer but focus on getting a job, just like last year when I didn't get my job until late August.  What's more, I see ahead of me years of this same problem, until the budget finally allows me to keep a job for more than a year (but honestly there are 10-year temps in my district).

At the same time, I feel so angry to see the complacent permanent teachers (though this doesn't apply to all of the permanents) who don't make much of an effort to continually improve on their methods as a teacher *always* should - I just wish they'd give room for people like me who are still passionate.  

All this uncertainty and lack of hope is really depressing me.  No career should have to be like this - the people who are good at their jobs should get to keep them and the people who are not...well, they need to stop being the ones to influence children's minds for an entire year.

To be clear, **I'm not looking for explanations about the economy or unions.** I get those things, and know it's hard to make changes at such a large scale.  I just wonder what those of you who have been at this for a while do so that entire summers for years on end aren't ruined.  I want to hold on to the enjoyment I've had the rest of the year.

Some of the main points I've already come up with is a better system to report it (anonymously so that someone doesn't get bullied even more due to tattling). Better education on the topic and how students can deal with it (this is more anecdotal, but in my schools teachers/administration rarely talk about bullying). And lastly less restrictions on what teachers are able to do (I have yet to really look for sources, but I have read many stories about teachers on Reddit being disciplined for interfering in bullying)

So I guess what I'm looking for is any feedback on how effective you as teachers think those ideas would be, and any other suggestions you might have.

I've just had 'field experiences' where I pretty much just am a student aide and taught a couple lessons. And it's all been wonderful, I just really have never been 'in control' of a classroom yet.

But here's the thing... I still look like a 16 year old girl. I've actually gotten berated by security at one of the high schools I was spending time at for being outside during class hours and I had to show him my college ID to prove I wasn't a student cutting class... 

And, I'm aware that I'm an attractive girl as well. Students in the classes I've aided have definitely tried to flirt with me before.

Some of my friends tell me that my appearance is going to cause issues for me in terms of earning respect. I know of course that my position of teacher will be obvious, and I know of course that I must project an air of professionalism and of course never ever ever act in a way that would jeopardize my position. I make a point to dress conservatively and act maturely, and I'm confident enough that what my students think in this regard wouldn't bother me personally.

But I do worry if there ever will be some 'hot for teacher' awkward situation that I'll have to deal with... whether it be an obvious thing (and I know there are plenty of class clowns out there), or a more subtle occurrence such as, a student being nervous around me, and if there is a best way of dealing with that? I don't think it's very conducive to the learning environment to inadvertently be a distraction from yourself... or is there a way I can use it to my advantage? I suppose it depends on the personality of the classroom, for sure.

I had no prior classroom experience/training so I was quite nervous and felt very unprepared.  It was only for half the day (3 class periods) and they were all senior/junior level language arts courses. 

Highlights:

The students were respectful and many were very helpful.  I didn't really have to actively teach any lessons, as the plan left for me by the teacher mostly consisted of the students working on projects and copying an exam review.  Needless to say, most of the students finished with a lot of time remaining.  Some worked on other homework, others read, some played scrabble, and others just talked or listened to music quietly.  

If that's all that my day had consisted of, then I would have considered that a good first day.  However, a couple things happened that really made it a great experience.  First, I noticed a couple boys were terribly bored so I gave them a couple of brain teasers to work on, and they almost immediately recruited a small group around them and seemed to enjoy the activity.  In another class (last period), I caught a boy trying to sneak out of the classroom.  I sternly confronted him.  He did not seem to appreciate me for it, but by the end of the class I was sitting in a desk next to him and we discussed some of his favorite bands/albums, and I could tell that I had something of a genuine ""breakthrough"" with him.

My question to r/teaching is if I just simply lucked into a great situation or can I expect most days to be similar?

I like what I'm hearing from people: essentially, use the website as a supplemental aid to class content, but be careful about using it to *require* work from students. Also beware of students who might abuse the website to tease other students, etc. 

In all, a website has the following advantages:

* Enhance communication opportunities with parents and students
* Provide copies of coursework online for students who were absent
* *Perhaps* provide opportunities to submit homework digitally (as long as analog HW is available)
* Use Facebook/Twitter to push notifications to students
* Share additional videos/news online

I want to be a good teacher and get through to my students.  I don't want to be ineffective (as many foreign English teachers are).  What do you recommend I do from now until March to best prepare?

-It differs from Quick Key (seen on Reddit) because it is currently available on the store NOW and can scan up to 100 question exams.  Quick Key is still beta testing and has only shown the ability to scan 30 question quizzes.

How would you feel as teachers?,pinkhead,14,8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/1gce5j/am_i_overreacting_how_would_you_feel_as_teachers/,"I volunteer at my daughter's school, pretty much full time. I had to shut my business a few months ago and I was at a loose end, I hate not having anything to do, so I started volunteteering at the school - I was already checked as I was teaching Spanish there (on a voluntary basis). I started off just going in for a couple of hours each afternoon, but pretty soon they were ringing me to ask me to cover for other staff and members of staff were asking me to come in to do specific jobs, then the school asked me to work one to one with a special needs student. So, I'm now there pretty much full time, I go in at 8.30 and I leave at 3.30, I don't usually take a lunch break as I've been helping some students prepare a dance for the end of year performance.
I got told today that I'm not allowed to use the staff room to have a tea or coffee as I'm not a paid member of staff, so could I please stop using it. I'm fucking incandescent with rage. A (large) part of me wants to say well fuck you and not go back, but I've made a commitment to the students. The special needs boy I work with has made great progress (I'm not claiming I'm a fantastic teacher, he just needs one to one attention which he doesn't get if I'm not there), the girls I'm working on the dance with won't be able to get it ready on their own, a couple of members of staff (who are appreciative) have already asked me to cover classed for them. So I can't really tell the school to fuck off without letting down a lot of other people who don't deserve that.

Maybe I'm over-reacting, maybe they're in the right.  As teachers, how would you feel about having a parent in the staff room - bear in mind that this is a small village school and about half the staff have children at the school, so it's not like I'm the only parent there.

There's already a few review sites, but they're blog-like and are written by their editors. I'd rather see an open community effort with apps submitted and reviewed by the community of educators is supports. My wife thinks its a good idea. Alas, she is but one teacher and likely very biased!

Just a really quick question - I am looking at the 'History Guide' for IB (first exam 2010). it's like a 98 page document - the detailed one.

My question is - how can I fit the Vietnam war into this? It seems that Route 2 - 20th Century History is much easier. 

However... It lists under Topic 4 (anticolonialism) Ho Chi Minh, and it mentions Vietnam in the Cold War section (Topic 5) but if you look at Topic 1 - Causes, practices and effects of war - it doesn't list the Vietnam War as Material for Detailed study. It seems a perfect fit for almost every point on there! What gives?

I guess I don't understand how IB works.

I feel that I was successful in my previous jobs, and did things outside of what was required of me that make me proud, but its hard to focus on these small wins. 

Has anyone dealt with this before? What strategies have you used to become more confident with who you are as an individual and as a teacher? Can I 'fake it till I make it?' Lift me up, people of Reddit!! :)

I graduated college with a genuine desire to teach. I had a passion for sharing what I've learned, and seeing other people make leaps in critical thinking. During undergrad I worked at a private school for students with aggressive behaviors, and was unfazed. I knew that they needed more males in the classroom. So I felt confident when I got a job as an IA at a high school back home through an administrator I knew, and was even accepted into a grad program for an M.Ed. This is in a county that provides some of the highest salaries for teachers in the country.

But after almost a year of working here, I've lost the sense that I could make a difference. The smart kids are smart enough to get by, and the kids who don't easily fit into the system fall through the cracks, one way or another.

[This video summarizes what I feel should be taking place but is not.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U)

And I know that this resonates with many educators, all over the place. Including the ones in my school--and seeing a teacher who is in midlife and completely burnt out scares me, because I'm afraid that it's what I'll turn in to.

I feel completely paralyzed. Do I trudge on, and hope that at some point in my professional career I will have lived long enough to see a transformational change in our educational model? Or do I cut my losses now, and find other niches to fulfill my passions? 

I know that other redditors have had similar feelings and thoughts, and I want to know how you resolved them. The thought of turning my back on education leaves me with a small pit of guilt in my stomach, as though I'm betraying something.

I'm an engineering student who teaches private piano lessons to pay rent and help with tuition. I'd like advice from you music teachers out there who have more experience than me (and I'm sure there are plenty of you! :D) Input from people who don't teach music is welcome too; I'm sure you might have good stuff for me to think about as well that's universal for teaching across the board, so don't hesitate to answer! 

First of all, I have no formal training in teaching; I was just sort of dropped into the world of private lessons about three years ago. I LOVE it, but I have very little experience or background knowledge other than what I've picked up on the job. So even advice on how kids' brains work will be helpful. 

I have a six-year-old student who is just having one hell of a time understanding basic rhythm drills. Most of my students start with me around age 5-7, so I don't want to approach it as ""maybe he's too young"" just yet. He seems to really want to learn, but whenever we work on anything, it just doesn't -click-. 

He's Hispanic, and English is his second language, so I'm wondering if it's partially a language barrier. I have another student who is 5 and Chinese, though, who is excelling phenomenally, so I'm not sure.

We've been doing tapping drills where he taps out extremely rudimentary left and right hand rhythms on the floor/piano/lap/etc. He gets his left and his right hands mixed up enough to where I think the two are almost interchangeable to him. He also can't seem to remember the difference between quarter and half notes, and doesn't grasp the concept of counting in beats. He also has this thing where he looks like he's focusing really hard, but really has unintentionally zoned out and has been in la la land for the past ten minutes. 

The poor kid is so lost, and I don't really want to keep making him do rhythm drills because we're getting nowhere fast, but I don't really know how to get him to understand how to read basic rhythm. All of my kids are on a semester contract with me. What should I do to help this kid out? Should I maybe work on a different topic? What would a good different approach be?

So I've had time to somewhat diagram an idea for a class which has probably been thought of before but thought I'd float it for some discussion or comments.

The idea is to individualize progression down ""paths"" within a course itself, encouraged by achieved awards and competitive awards. Forgive the comparison, but think talent trees in lots of MMO games. I teach English and, as such, I've observed that some students excel at grammar, others at literature discussion, literature comprehension, and even poetry (I say even because poetry is slowly dying out of public education in many places). These different categories provide the basic structure.

For example: A student on the poetry track would begin with very simple examination of very simple poems. ""Fire and Ice"" by Robert Frost. In order to progress to the next level, the student would be required to write a paper explicating the poem in a manner according to a grading rubric. Of course, in order to do this, the student would have to employ skills discussed in the ""formal lecture"" of the class as well as methods learned through individualized lessons with the teacher and others in that track. Successful completion of this tier would reward a corresponding treat, such as a day off or free drink/snack/other things students like to get. The tier for studying ""The Raven"" would award something like the poster of the poem in the shape of a raven or perhaps the t-shirt. (Putting cost aside for the theory) The variety of rewards and individualized instruction would allow for all students to progress at their own pace.

In addition to the individual progression, the program would encourage class competition. Students in each track would compete for ranks from ""10th chair"" the lowest, with some name like Mother Goose perhaps, to ""1st chair"" the highest. The students would be assigned tasks to perform in front of the class with guest teachers as judges. Rewards for achieving ranks would be greater and ongoing such as being first in line for lunch, privileges in behavior, etc. In order to advance to the highest chairs, students would need to diversify their path progression, so that they invest time in each path while still focusing on their primary line. This would be primarily encouraging for self motivating students.

Obviously this would be designed for an accelerated class or an AP class, at least at first. The goal being to encourage students to explore things on their own with the teacher acting as a guided hand, returning curiosity and innovation to what can be a very tired study. The prime motivator is not the small rewards, but actually the instant gratification of the early tiers. This starts acting as a temptation for the later levels which require significantly more work. The method of evaluation would be a one to one understanding demonstrated for the teacher which is hard to feign or momentarily master as opposed to a multiple choice test. Of course all of this would require a tremendous amount of work for the teacher, but I think it could properly engage many students at a level they have never experienced before.

I apologize if my description is erratic, but I'm trying to think myself to sleep. I would appreciate thoughts, comments, pointing out gaping holes, etc.

Happy teaching.

When asked how he would continue to support such a lifestyle later on in life if he didn't know how to do anything else, he just said, ""i'd steal them and no one would know. i'll just be a burglar."" I know he didn't really mean it, he's just a bit of a smart ass. The more I asked him to just do his work, the more adamant he became to NOT do it. There were a lot of ""Why do I have to do it?""s.

But going back to my original question, I couldn't come up with anything witty for a counter-argument. Anything I would say, regardless of how reasonable and rational it sounded, he'd just shut it down. I guess I couldn't really come up with a way to say it all in kid-speak.

I've got decent interviewing skills (as far as I can tell) because my university supervisor for my student teaching did extensive practice interviewing, and she says I'm about as prepared as I can be. I've read up on the school and it's mission statement and some of their practices. However, I have some questions about the logistics of it all. 

I know I should be early, but how early? I've got about a four hour drive to get there. But I want to make sure. If I'm too early, I'll look around the town a bit, since I've never been there. However, how early should I actually show up at the school? 

Second, they didn't tell me to bring anything specific to the interview, since they have most of my documents already. However, besides a notepad and a few prepared questions, is there anything else I need? Extra copies of things, perhaps? My student teaching portfolio? I was told no one would care about it, but would it be something good to have? 

Third, what do I wear? I keep getting mixed advice, so I want someone in the field to speak up. The lady at career services for the university told us that she tells all the business majors to avoid bright colors at all costs. However, I have this beautiful red dress that is neither short, tight, or low cut, and formal looking enough to be great, and other people keep telling me that would make me stand out. It has personality, and shouldn't that be a good thing for a teacher? Do I wear the white dress I have instead? Go with the red? Or find something in between? I'm so confused. How much does color matter if I look professional? 

If there's any other advice you have for me, please let me know! I'm really, really nervous!

How many of you were considered the top of your class in school/had a high GPA?

I'm a second year 6th grade Language Arts teacher for a small, high poverty, high at-risk student school and I'm at a crossroads.

All last year as a first-year, I heard everyone comforting with the mantra, ""Next year will be better/easier.""  But that hasn't been the case at all, and in many regards this year has been more difficult than last year.  Maybe the first quarter was easier, but after that I've encountered some major burn out, frustration, feelings of being overwhelmed.  All the teachers are sympathetic and experiencing burn out, too, which helps my psyche in one way, but that still doesn't mitigate the fact that I'm feeling like shit and actively hating my job.

I'm tired of filling out behavior modification plans, I'm tired of 12 year olds talking back to me, I'm tired of  dealing with apathetic parents.  I'm tired of teaching a reading intervention class with next to no resources or training, and I'm tired of seeking advice from my peers and principal and being told either ""I feel your pain"" or ""Learn to prioritize better.""  I'm tired of scrambling for resources while always grading and calling home for things that never change.  I look for and often find the little joys/victories in the day, but they're few, far between, and buried by all the defeats and disenfranchisement.

I've always wanted to go into education, preferably at a high school level, so maybe a change to high school will work?  The more enticing thought is going to grad school, getting my degrees, and finding a college or university to be a professor.  I know my content backwards and forwards, and I miss applying it at a higher level.

What do you think?  I'm planning on finishing the year out, of course (sans some extreme development), but next year I don't know.  I don't care at this point about becoming a statistic; our school/district has crazy high turnover (which shouldn't really surprise you, gentle reader) and if I genuinely dislike what I'm doing, then isn't that a sign for a change?

I am an ed. tech, but am also doing my student teaching in an ESL classroom this year. This is my first year at the middle school - I had been at the primary elementary before this. There is one student in particular in the ESL class who gives my mentor teacher and I (along with any student he doesn't like) a lot of guff. He generally doesn't want to be in school and hates putting effort into anything he doesn't like. 

My mentor had to leave on Friday for a half day, leaving me to sub. 20 minutes after she had left, things were going pretty well, and the room was silent as students were working on an independent quiz. As I was writing on the board, the student I mentioned above started moaning and complaining loudly that he didn't want/know what to write as answers on the quiz. Before I can act, another girl across the room called out for him to shut up and gave him the finger. He called out, ""yeah fuck you, too."" I gave them both detentions. Neither seemed very surprised.

The question:

Detentions are totally teacher-controlled. They will come to my mentor's room after school tomorrow, and even though she is technically responsible for them as the official teacher, I'm going to be taking it over not only for the experience it adds to my student teaching, but also so that these students don't get the impression that they need to listen to my mentor more than to me or that I won't carry through with what I say in the classroom. There is no official protocol for detention activity that I am aware of. 

So: what do I have them do? I know that a tedious task really isn't going to teach them anything or get at the cause of the issue, but at the same time, I want their time in detention to be really awful so that the idea of getting another is really unattractive.

So I'm a teacher intern and I've been tasked to start the day by teaching the novel ""The Skin I'm In.""  Since I'm know, I've established a routine where they finish their independent reading, then sit down with their books as they listen to the book on tape as a class.  I do one chapter per day.

After the chapter reading is over, I try to lead a discussion by asking questions.  Unfortunately, a literary discussion with 7th graders is very hit or miss.  I close the discussion by giving them a journal entry to complete in their notebooks, something that connects the book with their real life. 

Today convinced me I should change it up.  Discussions are not working the way I want to with their rowdy behavior.  They get too riled up to want to complete the journal, and when they finish, I can't convince them to stay quiet to let the others finish.
  I'm afraid to do any cooperative learning exercises or games or anything that'll convince them to shout over one another.  

The one thing that worked is a series of tasks.  Right after one chapter reading, I lead a short (often loud) discussion about the chapter and how it could relate to slavery.  Then I gave them a picture prompt, a pic related to slavery, and asked them to write about it....and then the reactions from two of the characters.

I've just reached chapter 20, and I'm low on ideas to keep them engaged while keeping them from creating chaos.

Please help!  Any ideas for teaching a core novel?

EDIT:  I'm also being observed by my supervisor every week!  No pressure!

1348672617.0,7,self.teaching,10ics5,"A radio show today had superintendents and others on who were talking about the gap in graduation rates of black and hispanic males in high school. They were talking about different learning styles. Reddit, what do you think about this idea of learning style differences among students?",informationmissing,8,1,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/teaching/comments/10ics5/a_radio_show_today_had_superintendents_and_others/,"The guests on today's show were saying things like ""students of color have different learning styles"" and ""students of color learn by doing"". These statements are very wrong on many levels. The education community has taken the idea proposed by Howard Gardner, that people have different types of intelligence and run with it.

The education community has blindly accepted the idea that people have different learning styles. This idea is not supported by psychological research. Psychological research has not shown that there is any measurable difference among people of varied backgrounds or ethnic communities in the way that they learn. Howard Gardner's ideas have not been supported by research in psychology either.

The statement ""people of color have different learning styles than others"" is then a simply ignorant statement, or at the worst purely racist.

The statement ""people of color learn better by doing"" is simply misleading because it implies that other students don't learn better this way. *All* students learn better by doing. 

Unfortunately, teaching in an inquiry based classroom takes more time than a traditionally taught classroom. Do you think you have the time for an inquiry curriculum? What is the subject you teach? 

Edit:I am not actually suggesting that the guests on the show were racist. I am only suggesting that because of their ignorance about what has or has not been validated by research, their statement could be construed that way.

Edit2: there has been a lot of discussion that goes something like this, ""Person x is better than Person y at something, therefore they have a learning style that fits the topic"". There are a few problems with this.
# First, it's not enough. A single example does not make a rule. For instance, If I wanted to **prove** to you that any time you multiply a negative number by another negative number  you get a positive result, and to ""prove"" it I showed you this math:  -5 * -2 = 10,  this would not be proof. This is just an example, and does not show that it works for all numbers. 
# Second, Person x's success at the task might be better explained by something else, like intelligence. Most research into the topic shows a correlation between a person's success and IQ. **NOTE**: I am *not* suggesting that white kids are smarter than others. I'm only saying that I don't think this idea of ""learning styles"" is a valid concern for the gap in graduation rates. There must be something else happening. 

Edit3: I spoke with a psychologist I know who said that ""multiple intelligences"" as Gardner proposed and ""learning styles"" are not the same thing, though they were taught as being much the same in my Ed classes at school.

I teach at a school that has a reputation in some ways for being ""rough"" - lots of challenging behaviours, lots of students from pretty bad home backgrounds (not surprisingly the two things are often related). 

I teach five classes and I would say that I have a reasonable to excellent rapport with three of them (two 7th grade classes and an 11th grade class). 

However, I feel like I am really struggling to manage the other two. An 8th grade class and a 9th grade class. It's starting to get to me because at the beginning of the year when I was having problems my head teacher assured me that if I continued to be consistent and have high expectations that they would eventually settle down and we would have a smooth run. 9 months later it feels like not much has changed. 

I feel like I am constantly being the ""bitch"" teacher to both of these classes. I find myself yelling at them far more often than I would like. Two days ago I completely lost it at my 8th grade class because a large group of them were being deliberately disruptive, rude, nasty and disrespectful and they didn't give a shit when I disciplined them. It took my head teacher coming in and giving them all afternoon detentions for them to show even the slightest sign of recognition that what they had done was wrong. It's a similar kind of story with the year 9 class. Just constant, deliberate disrespect. One of the main ringleaders in this class told my head teacher that he was deliberately targeting me because I was a small woman and he wanted to see if he could push me over the edge. I just find that so unbelievably nasty. 

I'm tired of being treated with disrespect. I'm tired of having students flatly refuse to follow instructions and then treat the ensuing consequence like it's nothing. I'm tired of having to get to the point of suspending a student before they will show any kind of change in behaviour, and even then it's temporary. I'm tired of hearing the kids in these classes saying that they hate me and hate the subject I teach, because I try so hard every day to get them on board. I'm tired of being ignored when I ask for reasonable procedures to be followed and then verbally abused when I pull them up on it.  I'm tired of hearing how wonderfully the other first year teachers in the school are doing with these classes, using the same strategies as I am. Why isn't it working for me? 

I try so hard every day to remain calm, to remember it's not personal, to carry on regardless, but I can only take so much, and eventually I end up yelling and being the kind of teacher I always swore that I would never become. I find it hard to keep the tone of the lessons positive and conducive to learning when half the students in the room seem to be intent on disrupting the lesson, disrespecting me to my face and then having the nerve to laugh at me or tell me to fuck off or (insert unnecessarily rude statement here) when given a consequence for their poor behaviour. 

I took today off work because I just couldn't face another day of it this week. I've spent the whole day so far stressing about how tomorrow is going to go. How can I face that 8th grade class when the last time I saw them I damaged what little rapport I had managed to build by letting my frustration surface and yelling at them? And when  say yelling, it wasn't the ""fake"" raised voice to bring a class under control. I was *yelling*. And I am so ashamed of myself but at the same time I am so upset and stressed and frustrated with this class.

I have an idea about a teaching routine, and I was curious what actual teachers might think of it; its usefulness, effectiveness, practicality, etc:

Open each class with a word problem on the board that hits on some or all of the concepts laid out in the chapter for the day. Then maneuver a group discussion to solve the problem. By ""maneuver"", I mean let the students lead the discussion primarily, let them figure out what they don't understand about the problem and be there to answer those questions, try to aim the discussion - by asking appropriate questions - towards the concepts of the chapter and outline them explicitly when they come up. Continue until the problem is solved. If some concepts did not come up or you have the extra time or it seems like most of the students didn't understand, you may need another problem to walk through. Have students take notes on key definitions and concepts (or possibly hand out a paper with the key defs and concepts). 

Follow that up with an independent homework sheet similar to the end of chapter questions in most textbooks (hits on each concept at varying levels of abstraction and application). Students work on this for the remainder of class (10-15 min) and can ask the teacher questions to clarify anything they might not understand. The teacher uses this time to help students who may typically have problems understanding the first go. Students complete at least 3-5 problems per section of the worksheet. Homework is handed in at the beginning of class the next day, and issues the students may have had in the worksheet are briefly discussed.

Other factors:

* No book for the class, so the students can't read ahead. I want the students to have the experience of figuring problems out for themselves.

* If a student is particularly vocal and seems to know all the answers, they become the ""representative at the board"" and have the task of writing out ideas other students might have. Board reps are not allowed to talk or write things down without the other students telling them. The teacher would start as the board rep, and only relinquish if necessary to keep someone from blurting everything out or to include someone who does not contribute much vocally.

* Students are encouraged to have a discussion, so raised hands don't really work... but possibly throwing a ball to designated speakers might help organize the discussion.

**TL;DR** Introduce concepts through class discussion solving word problems. Follow up with homework.

What do you think r/teaching? Is this a good idea? How could I make it better, or should I scrap it?

My favorite game to play with students to pass a few minutes is called “I’m going on a trip”. It works well with most younger grades (I have played it in grades 1-6), you just have to change the difficulty. It goes like this.

“I’m going on a trip and I am bringing ____. Who wants to come with me?” Each student takes a turn and says what they will bring on the trip. If the student brings a correct item, they get to go on the “trip”.

For example, this is what I might say to a grade 1 class. ”I’m going on a trip and I am going to bring a strawberry. I am also going to bring a fire truck and a heart. Who wants to come with me?” (I usually give 3 item clues to start for younger grades but you can start with only one or two items.)

Student 1 “I would like to bring a banana. Can I come on the trip?”

Teacher “No. Sorry. Not this time.”

Student 2 “I would like to bring come cherries. Can I come on the trip?”

Teacher “Yes, you can come with us! Now we have strawberries, a fire truck, a heart and cherries.”

And on it goes. Students must figure out what all the items have in common. I’ve used colours, letters, specific topics we were learning about in school (e.g. things that float), events, etc.

Day 3: periods 3,4,1, 7, 8, 5 meet

The latter has a nasty habit of undermining my authority (that I am now putting in over-time to recover) in the classroom, chews me out whenever I'm wrong (and even more so when I'm not but she THINKS I am) and failing to communicate important things regarding my lessons or units.

Most RECENT example: We are in week 5 of the semester and I'm in week 3 of teaching (but I've been here since August as part of an internship). Apparently, we are supposed to spend usually 3 but no more than 4 weeks on the first unit in a writing class and I'm heading into the 5th week. There are 20 extra days this semester so I figured I needed to stretch my units to make up for that time. Good, right? Students get more time to work.

I showed her my plan for this unit OVER A MONTH AGO and she said it was great. She never once said or implied that I was taking too long with it. Not. Once. This afternoon while we were working in the classroom together she mentioned that I was wasting time working on the current project. 

WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME THIS A MONTH AGO WHEN YOU SAW HOW LONG MY UNIT WAS GOING TO BE?!?!?! I think it makes her feel better about herself to point out what she considers serious mistakes on the behalf of others.

I'm tired of being at fault for ignorance and poor communication.

What do I do? I'm biting the bullet currently. Weather the storm. But I'm scared to ask for her help because her superiority complex is very off-putting and so far she hasn't been of help. 

The situation is made even more difficult with the fact that this person is a very old friend of my mom. She's known me since I was born. My parents know and understand. They advised me not to tell anyone ""Just because it's the right thing to do doesn't mean you should do it,"" they said. It can get me into hot water, I understand. 

But I feel like an abused kid.

I've e-mailed the university coordinator for English ed. She hasn't replied.

I'm seeking advice for my sister.

She is very close to finishing up her bachelors degree in elementary education. She's doing student teaching now and finding that she hates it, doesn't have strong enough personality to keep the kids in line, etc.

She's asking me for advice on what to do and I'm at a loss. It would be one thing if she were fresh out of high school then into teaching and decided it wasn't working, but she's 30 and has already abandoned two other potential careers (hair dressing, then medical transcription). It seems she goes through training and then when it comes time to actually work, decides she doesn't like it.

My belief is that it's a work ethic problem more than hating the teaching itself but saying that to her just results in a fight.

So I'm hoping anyone can help me come up with some decent advice for her other than to suck it up and stay the course. She has financed this ed degree via student loans and needs to start making money to pay them back. None of us in her family are wealthy so she needs to support herself. I'm very afraid that she's destined for a life of shitty retail jobs and welfare and not sure what to do about it.

uhg.

I am a sophomore and ,even in high school, I routinely see teachers treat kids like they are total idiots for asking questions and chastise them for even talking quietly about the subject!

I am a curious student and I always seek to learn about how and why things work, but I get mediocre grades because I simply cannot organize myself and I can't bear doing menial, repetitive tasks; usually because I've already learned the stuff! 
It seems that an unusual amount of my teachers are on a power trip, like they enjoy humiliating their pupils. What can I do, as a student, to try to make teachers more facilitative of my different ways of doing things? Also, is this the norm when it comes to views on education, or am I just at a sucky school?

The class is quite tricky, but Kid A and Kid B have a major history with each other - violence, name calling, racist abuse, you name it. Kid A is quite manipulative, whereas Kid B is simplistic but has a very short fuse and will shout, swear and turn violent quite easily (otherwise he's fairly placid).

THe lesson was AWFUL. Some form of incident whilst lining up between A and B meant they came in high as kites and were already massively aggressive towards each other. I remained calm throughout but was literally at my wits end as to what to do with them. In the end it seemed futile to try and keep them in the same classroom, so seant Kid A to work elsewhere as they were trying to get the rest of the class involved in winding up Kid B (succesfully I might add).

I'm being observed with this group on monday and ahv eno idea how to approach it.

I am currently a PhD in behavioral neuroscience considering my options after I graduate.  I'm leaning towards stepping away from the path most of my peers take (PhD- Post Doc Fellowships- Assistant Prof- Tenure Track) and I've been thinking seriously about getting into secondary education.

I know that I'd have to go through a licensing processes and teaching isn't exactly the most stable of occupations presently, but teaching high school (or middle school) or middle school science seems to fit my views on what I should be doing with my experience far more than research.

I am just looking for any feedback from those of you who are currently teachers.  I understand that a PhD may make me too expensive for many schools, but is it impossible to get hired if you have a terminal degree?  

Beyond that, any comments on working as a teacher with a PhD (or working alongside someone with a PhD) would be immensely helpful.  I'm just trying to get a feeling of how someone like me would be perceived by other teachers and the administration.
