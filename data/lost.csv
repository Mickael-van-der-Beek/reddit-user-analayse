Thematically, Jacob's age has passed. The battle of good versus evil has gone, and with it Zoroastrianism. Christ has returned to make his sacrifice again, and then Christian Shepherd has left the building, and so on. No more pointless, arbitrary rules like ""don't kill your brother,"" which fail to take human nature into account and ultimately create more problems than they resolve. No more Latin incantations over golden cups which amount to nothing more than aesthetics.

""That's how Jacob ran things. Maybe there's another way. Maybe there's a better way.""

Fuck yeah there is. It's Hurley Time.

What's Hurley Time? It's drinking The Water from a crappy plastic bottle, not an ornamental chalice, because that kind of pretense is meaningless now. It's seeing the water for what it is: not some sparkley Fern Gully nectar bullshit, but real, grey water scooped from the creek bed. It's not about invoking references to Shiva's blinking eye; it's about quoting Star Wars. It's about asking Ben (help me Obi Wan!), the character who embodies so many dark sides of human nature, as well as the fallibility that comes with devotion to an uncertain divinity, to work with him, so that Hurley can learn from him and account for these shortcomings. ""It would be my honor,"" says Ben, and Hurley just replies ""Cool."" 

If you thought the story's surface reading was happy, consider the rise of Hurley. He's Damon and Carlton's hope for a new philosophy in a new age. Perhaps more than any other character, Hurley has the unique ability to see his own flaws. The early onset of his ability to talk to the dead allowed him to question his own sanity, and with it he became self-alienated, able to view both his internal and external human psyches as they wreak their own forms of havoc. Consider the show's ensemble cast: by including a blisteringly wide array of philosophies, it invited more tailored opportunities for identification and ultimately self-reflection for more viewers than practically any other show. In short, the cast allowed viewers to examine the externalities of their own philosophies and hopefully even recognize the shortcomings. 

Hurley is unabashedly Dude-like. He's practically a modern Buddhist who doesn't get hung up on the edifices. Hurley is right behind Desmond in accepting that time is not necessarily linear, and that that the universe can potentially operate in much stranger ways than most would account for. The show's structure agrees; somehow, the same events keep rippling through time in ceaseless cyclicality, as Buddhists believe of the world itself.

Hurley isn't out prowling around the jungle, searching for answers to all the island's mysteries. No, he practices *wu wei*--Hugo goes with the flow. This is because he recognizes the false dichotomy, as well. Hurley knows that finding a cache of fresh food can be a curse, or that winning the lotto can be a damnation. The best that he can hope for is peace through understanding and balance.

Ultimately, Hugo serves as a parallel to someone who ""gets"" the show for what Damon and Carlton intended. By other means than actually watching the show, he has come to recognize that ""good"" and ""evil"" are artifacts of perspective. He sees that mankind is not perfect, and that understanding human nature is important, and that the same mistakes can echo on unchecked. He knows that there is nothing to be gained from hunting down the great mysteries of the universe, and that seeking the light can be fatal at best. But he also knows that it's necessary to pull the plug out of the wall and put it back in to get things working again. Hurley knows that a reset is necessary to overcome the inevitable failures of machinery, and that window dressing is nothing more. 

So why not make Hurley the star? The exact same reason that you would drive a show like Lost with a mystery system that goes unanswered: because, ideally, Christians go in one end and Hurleys (or deconstructivist neo-Buddhists, etc.) come out the other. American Christians want to see Good vs. Evil, and they want to see pure evil embodied. And they want to see a Christ cycle, where Jesus sacrifices himself for the good of mankind and rises again to heaven. And they want to see all the mysteries of the universe laid bare and all the answers given, and that's the promise that gets everyone's attention. But Lost won't give it to them. And Lost will give them a Christ cycle where the Christ figure is practically Byronic and so thoroughly redeemed that he's barely human by the time it ends. And Lost will give them an Evil that isn't really evil, and then they won't even give it a name in order to show just how ridiculous and projection-based the idea of personified evil is in the first place. Lost conjured the Christian mythos and then teabagged it in the face. But the best part is that most of the audience hasn't even realized it yet. They're just confused, or bitter or disfranchised, but in time the secret will creep up the back of their skulls when they recognize that, instead of the answers that they'll never find, Lost has given them new ways of dealing with the questions that they'll never outrun.

So hats off to Damon and Carlton. Like it or not, they truly knew what they were doing from the start. I, for one, welcome our new fat Hispanic overlord.

Kate's actions seem erratic (randomly kissing Jack in the jungle) to constantly attending to Sawyer's wounds and flirting with him as he regains consciousness from his shoulder gunshot injury.

Then my wife pipes in with this, ""Do you think Kate is torn between  Jack and Sawyer because one reminds her of her father and the other of her childhood love (Dr. Tom Brennan)? Then it clicked. My wife is a genius.

Also, watching the pilot, I felt pretty smug when the first words uttered by Hurley on the show were, ""Dude, I'm not going anywhere."" as he eventually becomes the caretaker of the island and doesn't go anywhere after all.

1274705804.0,164,self.lost,c7izf,An attempt to analyze a few of loose ends.,Jorsh,217,53,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/c7izf/an_attempt_to_analyze_a_few_of_loose_ends/,"I feel like the finale presented a really good surface reading for the show, but there's still a lot to delve into symbolism-wise to tie it all to a single thematic core.  There have been a lot of recurring symbols that I'd like to try my hand at incorporating into what we all just saw.

**The Numbers:**

Obviously, they were the numbers of Jacob's candidates, AKA the Losties, but there's an important symbolism that kind of got left behind in all the explanation and demystification.  They all add up to 108, which was also featured on the mural in the Hatch second season, alongside the very Buddhist DHARMA symbols.  Take a look at something I found a couple years back.

&gt;The ‘108 Bodhisattva' Terma is essentially a search for ‘108 Beings of Great Compassion, Virtuous hearts, and Pure Minds’, who will, in this age, be ‘catalysts for change and transformation on the earth’.

So that'd be the Losties.  It's important to note that a bodhisattva is someone who should have achieved enlightenment and escaped from the endless cycle of death and rebirth, but chose instead to stay behind to help others on their journeys.

**Games/Black and White:**

Obviously all alluding to the eternal battle between good and evil, personified in the struggle between Jacob and MIB.  This though, is in itself an allusion to Zurvanite Zoroastrianism, which paints existence as a struggle for the souls of men between a creative, good deity and a destructive, evil one.  Take a look at this:

&gt;Zurvanism's principal feature is then the notion that both Ahura Mazda (MP: Ohrmuzd) and Angra Mainyu (Ahriman) were twin brothers, with the former being the epitome of good and the latter being the epitome of evil. Further, this dichotomy was by choice, that is, Angra Mainyu chose to be evil: ""It is not that I cannot create anything good, but that I will not.""

In addition, game imagery reinforces a Buddhist notion of perpetual cycle, as a game is meant to be played over and over again, repeated indefinitely for its own purpose.

**Fire:**

A very important symbol in Zoroastrianism, probably to foreshadow and reinforce the above.

**Various Egyptian Imagery**:

Mostly ties into the Egyptian concept of the afterlife, and the fact that life and death are merely gateways to an enduring and everlasting afterlife that is very much like reality.  Sound familiar?

In addition, the statue of Taweret establishes the Island as a place of birth, or more appropriately, a place where life originates, from the light at the heart of the Island.  They were kind of explicit about this in Across the Sea.  The light at the center of the Island is what enables the universe and all the things in it to exist and live.  That's why the waters can act as a fountain of youth and revive people.  (As a side note, I'd like to go on record as saying that the fountain DID revive Sayid, as that sort of resurrection seems to be out of Smoky's jurisdiction.)

**Eyes:**

This one's fairly straightforward, in my opinion.  Shiva.

&gt;When [Shiva] opens His eyes, a new cycle of creation emerges and when He closes them, the universe dissolves for creation of the next cycle. The half-open eyes convey the idea that creation is going through cyclic process, with no beginning and no end. Lord Shiva is the Master of Yoga, as He uses His yogic power to project the universe from Himself. The half-open eyes also symbolize His yogic posture.

So, the series begins with Jack opening his eye, and ends with him closing it.  The time in between is a complete cycle of creation.

**So what's my conclusion from all this?**

They used a lot of symbolism from ancient religions (and more contemporary ones, e.g. Christian and Jack *Shepard*, *Jacob*) to suggest that they were all hinting at some universal truth, a protoreligion of fact that's being grasped at in parts but never on the whole.  Most of the focused religions place an emphasis on a complete cycle of death and rebirth as necessary opposites that create one another.  The series has also been chock full of other binary opposites that create one another through their opposition (the existence of science creates the need to have faith, for example).

By ""moving on"", the survivors accepted their deaths, entered into the Light at the heart of the Island, and created it anew, beginning the cycle over again.  ""There is no now"" because ""now"" has not started and has already ended.  They are between creations.

This is obviously just one reading, but I like it, and I'd like to hear what you guys think, especially since I'm sure I missed some stuff.

*Edit:* I forgot to mention that the final conversation between Jack and Christian took place in front of a stained glass window featuring the symbols of all the major world religions, just to drive the point home a bit more.",,False,,t5_2qhag,False,,,True,t3_c7izf,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/c7izf/an_attempt_to_analyze_a_few_of_loose_ends/,

[video](http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1936291)  
  
Do any of these questions really matter to the overall story and to the characters?  Feel free to add on to these answers and correct me if I am wrong.  
  
**1. Why did the monster kill the pilot?**  

It’s been said so many times that the island won’t let you leave.  Killing pilots and/or captains (authority figures) is a recurring theme: Both pilots of Oceanic 815, Captain Magnus Hanso of the Black Rock, the captain of Rousseau’s French expedition team, even Frank’s Ajira 316 copilot all died immediately after crashing on the island.  Frank seems to be the one exception.  Perhaps the island let him live because his purpose was to take the Ajira Six off the island.  By the by, “Ājira” is Arabic for “afterlife.”  
  


**2. What did Locke see when he first saw the smoke?**  

In “The Cost of Living” (season 3, episode 05), Locke told Mr. Eko that he saw a “beautiful bright light.”  That’s not what Mr. Eko saw.  Think back to the look on Jacob’s nameless little brother’s face when he saw the light in “Across The Sea.”  Locke had the same look on his face.  
  

**3. What’s with the polar bear in Walt’s comic?**  

It was a polar bear in a Green Lantern comic book (en espanol).  In said issue Green Lantern and the Flash fight a polar bear.  
  
Is this really a mystery?  It’s a clever piece of foreshadowing.  We know how/why polar bears ended up on the island.  DHARMA used polar bears in their experiments; they tried to adapt them to the tropical climate.  At some point DHARMA trained one of the polar bears to turn the frozen donkey wheel.  Thanks to Ben and Locke, we know that turning the wheel deposits you in the middle of the Tunisian desert. That’s why Charlotte found the remains of a polar bear and a DHARMA collar in the desert.  
  


**4. Where is Christian Shepard’s body if it’s not in the casket?**  

The Smoke Monster took the form of Christian and likely hid the real body somewhere so it wouldn’t be found.  

One of the most ambiguous and confusing aspects of LOST is Christian Shepard.  Smoke Monster Locke claimed he was pretending to be Christian.  But was he really?  It seems to me like he was lying.  I think the Christian Shepard seen on the island was really the ghost/sprit/soul (whatever) of Christian Shepard stuck there like Michael and so many others.  That would explain why he was in Jacob’s cabin protected by the circle of ash.  When Christian told Locke he had to move the island he was setting up Jacob’s grand plan (long con?) to defeat the Smoke Monster.  
  


**5. Why did the psychic say that Claire had to fly on Oceanic flight 815, and why did he insist that her son had to be raised by Claire?**  

Richard Malkin the psychic was a fraud.  He admitted this to Mr. Eko in “?” (season 2, episode 21).  In regards to being raised by Claire, we’ve seen time and time again what happens to children when another raises them, Jacob and his brother being the best example.  Or maybe he really was a physic and Jacob told him what to do.  
  


**6. Why did the Others want Walt so badly?**  
 
Probably the same reason Charles Widmore wanted Desmond so badly: He’s special, just like the Man in Black when he was a kid.  Walt had a lot of the qualities of a candidate.  
  
Another reason: The Others used Walt to get Michael to get Jack, Kate and Sawyer so that Jack could operate on Ben’s tumor.  Ben’s an elaborate dude.  
  


**7. Who sent Kate the letter telling her about her mother being treated for cancer in the hospital?**
Who the fuck cares?  It’s Kate.  Everybody hates Kate.  It could have been anyone, including the US Marshall who was trying to force her out into the open.  Or maybe it was Jacob.  Or maybe it was Kate from the past!  
  


**8. How does Walt know about the hatch and why does he warn Locke not to open it?**  

Was Walt referring to the hatch?  He wasn’t specific.  Walt is psychic and too young to control his abilities or even know when he’s using them, causing people to “see” Walt but instead of him telling them things, he merely echoes back their own worries.  
  

Walt is special.  Children are special.  This is a trope used in countless sci-fi and horror films.  Think Poltergeist.  Every child we’ve seen on the island has had visions, most usually involving ghosts.  Young MiB saw his dead mother.  Young Ben Linus saw his dead mother.  Miles was on the island as a baby and he ended up being able to talk to dead people.  The island has a special connection with children.  
  


**9. Why does the Smoke Monster make mechanical sounds?**  

That’s a stupid question.  If you want to complain about how an imaginary monster made out of black smoke doesn’t sound like all the other smoke monsters you've encountered in your worldly travels, be my guest.  How did Steven Spielberg know what dinosaurs sounded like?  
  


**10. How was Walt able to “apparate” before Shannon?**  

Was Walt really there?  Or was Shannon just seeing things?  It was established in “Special” (season 1, episode 14) that Walt is special.  He made a bird fly into a window.  He has psychic abilities.  He’s not the only LOST character with special powers.  The island’s mystical properties seem to have an effect on children.   It likely advanced his abilities and made them harder to control.  
  


**11. How did Walt communicate with Michael using the swan computer?**  

Was it Walt?  Who said it was Walt?  Computer said it was Walt.  It could have been anyone, most likely one of the Others pretending to be Walt.  Possibly even Ben.  It was a ploy to lure Michael out into the open where the Others could grab him.  
  


**12. What is the deal with Kate and that horse?**  

Kate is the glue that holds LOST together.  Glue is made from horses.  Not good enough?  OK, how about this: It’s a freaking horse.  There are polar bears on the island.  Why not a horse?  In fact, we know the Others have horses.  In “Enter 77” (season 3, episode 11) Beatrice “Bea” Klugh’s horse is tied up outside the Flame, the DHARMA communications station where Mikhail lived all by his lonesome.  Or maybe the horse Kate saw wasn’t there at all.  Maybe she was succumbing to the stress of surviving a plane crash and being stranded on a craxy magical island.  Also, does the title “Enter 77” foreshadow Jack, Kate, Hurley and Sayid entering 1977?  
  
**13. Why are supplies still being dropped on the island after the purge and by who(m)?**  

If you got one thing from the DHARMA Initiative storyline is that they’re a bunch of well-meaning techno-hippies who are fairly brilliant scientists but who are fairly ignorant when it comes to other areas of expertise, particularly organizational logistics.  These are the people who anointed “James LaFleur” their head of security after just randomly showing up one day.  Sure, he saved someone's life and kept Richard Alpert and the Others at bay but if he was secretly a stealth Other agent that was probably his plan all along.  Is it really hard to imagine DHARMA setting up supply drops with a contracted third party, paid for by trust funds or whatnot, and then having said drops continue long after the Initiative went defunct?  
  

DHARMA is still dropping supplies to their men inside the Swan hatch, just in case.  They may have no idea what’s going on the island.  They don’t know whether or not their people are still alive down in that hatch, pushing that damn button.  We never got an answer as to how they’re dropping the supplies but is that really important?  
  

**14. What triggered the lockdown and why on earth would anyone design it so that during the lockdown black lights go on?**  

The food drop triggered the lockdown.  DHARMA doesn’t want their people to see where the drops come from (probably why we, the viewer, never found out either).  As far as the black lights go, the Swan was designed and built in the seventies, man.  
  


**15. What happened to the original Henry Gale?**
Henry Gale’s balloon crashed on the island.  He broke is leg, died and was buried, probably by the Others (another example of the island’s issues with captains/pilots?)  Ben’s concocted story while he was impersonating Henry Gale was probably fairly accurate.  He’s a meticulously detailed individual.  Where’s the big mystery?  
  
Here’s something that will blow your mind: Henry Gale is Rose’s brother!  
  
No he’s not, you racist.  
  
**16. What happens to the original timeline Libby between the mental hospital and getting on the tail section of flight 815?**  

Libby’s husband Dave died.  That caused her to have a breakdown.  If you want more information on Dave and Libby I suggest you re-watch the Hurley-centric episode “Dave” (season 2, episode 18).  It will blow your mind.  
  

**17. Who built the four-toed statue?**  

The statue is Taweret.  The Egyptians probably built it sometime before 1800 BC, but there's no basis for assuming a date.  The island is crawling with evidence that ancient civilizations, like the Egyptians, once lived there.  “Across The Sea” takes place in 23 AD.  We know there were people on the island before then.  
  


**18. Why does only one specific bearing get you off the island?**  

We’ve seen what happens when you go to and fro the island at the wrong bearing.  The island is protected and hidden from the world.  It regularly moves around various oceans; it’s not just confined to the Pacific.  Ever wonder how a drug plane taking off from Africa, or a slave ship that set sail from Europe ended up on an island in the middle of the Pacific?   The island moves all around the Earth and within time and space.  There are charts and maps in the Lamp Post that show the various oceans it’s been in.  Whatever the island’s sphere of control that travels around the world is, it has an exit. This makes sense—the ocean needs to be allowed in otherwise the island would stick out.

1274738518.0,162,self.lost,c7ov2,"I think the most important question was, in fact, answered...",kentomc,227,65,108,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/c7ov2/i_think_the_most_important_question_was_in_fact/,"All other questions aside I think what we all wanted was a satisfying explanation of the nature of the Island's power and why it needed protecting.  The answer to this question would give the whole rambling story and all its characters purpose.

We miss the answer to this if we get too caught up in the details.  I see it like this:

What we already knew:

1) The island was a fragile gate at once protecting the world from annihilation and providing its life-force.

2) An individual has always been charged with protecting this fragile gate.

3) Messing with the gate has serious consequences to the basic foundations of our world, altering and confusing time itself.

4) MIB wanted desperately to leave the island but couldn't do so once he became the smoke monster.

What we learned from 'The End':

1) The smoke monster's ultimate goal was to open the gate (destroy the island).  He knew this alone would free him, allowing him to leave the island.
  
2) He did not know this would make him mortal again.

3) Opening the gate turned the island and possibly the whole planet into a colorless and chaotic hell-scape. 

What we can infer:

1) All the warnings about not letting MIB leave had nothing to do with him being evil or what he would do if unleashed on the world, but, rather, what would happen if he managed to open the gate.  MIB was not evil.  He was selfish.  He did not care what the consequences of opening the gate were.  He just wanted out.
 
2) The protectors were simple flawed humans, given conditional immortality to carry out their task.  Jacob's and MIB's 'mother' illustrates this.  She was not good, nor was she evil.  She seemed simply selfish - willing to murder a young mother and take her children so that she could one day be absolved of her responsibility as protector, passing it to one of these twin boys.

3) Jacob was just as human and flawed as anyone.  He made the mistake of killing MIB in such a way that his continued existence as the smoke monster was bound up in the preservation of the gate.

4) Much of what Jacob did over the years was damage control to make up for his initial mistake.  In the process he played fast and loose with many lives.  He did not have all the answers.

5) Jack, as protector, was able to eliminate the the threat Jacob had created because he was willing to risk opening the gate.  He acted where Jacob feared to act.


I think what was hard to swallow about all this is that we wanted Jacob to be something he wasn't - divine, a Deus Ex Machina, the one who would ultimately supply the context and answers necessary to resolve all the complicated loose ends, but he ended up being a flawed man, thrown into his position against his will and the will of his predecessor, and creating more problems than he resolved.

But in the end, we know what the island was.  We know what the protectors' role was.  We know what the smoke monster was and what it wanted.  We know why all these people were brought to the island.  The world as we know it was preserved and the gate remained intact under the protection of Hurley and Ben.

Most importantly, we see that all the individuals who played a part, major or minor, ultimately found purpose and love in their lives.  Regardless of his intentions, Jacob's machinations managed to give these lost souls purpose and helped them achieve peace.

Pretty excellent way for it all to wrap up if you ask me.

Take out some time today to read this article. If you do, you'll 1) Realize that there IS a meaning to LOST and what the island is 2) find out that the writers actually knew what they were doing since the pilot, and 3) clear up any post-The End confusion you may had. The article is LONG, but it is by far and wide the best explanation of LOST's overall meaning, and what the Island truly is. The article seriously ties all those missing ends together that the writers kept ""ambiguous,"" and methodically explains how monumentally intricate, yet clear, the shows underlying themes and meanings really were. 

Anyways, I hope people will read this! It's honestly sparked a whole new understanding, and interest, in the show and the story it told. I'm currently rewatching the series, I'm on S2E16, and EVERYTHING he points out makes complete sense and ties the whole damn story together. It also makes me appreciate that the writers DIDN'T explain everything, rather have us in true LOST fashion, figure out the puzzle for ourselves. Anyways, I hope we have some good discussions about all this... (Even if you're not convinced)



tl;dr If you're a fan of LOST, which we all are here, you'll take the time to read it. 

EDIT- Wow. I didn't expect the wide variety of opinions you guys have. I guess the reason why I like this explanation, or ""theory,"" of LOST is that it ties everything together so well. All the seemingly disparate and random stories make sense both allegorically and thematically under the veil of the island and the light at the center of it representing ""time."" Also, I like to think that the head writers (DARLTON) working on a show as ambitious and popular as LOST had an idea from the get go on what the island was, and how it would affect the writing process when creating the characters story acts and the shows overall themes. 

EDIT 2- Check out these lyrics from 'Time' By Pink Floyd.... ""And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking. Racing around to come up behind you again. The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older. Shorter of breath and one day closer to death. Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time.""  
Mother says to the boys, in explanation of the light in the cave, that ""a little bit of the same light that is in the cave is inside every man. But people always want more."" And what is something every single person on earth wants? More.... time. I sure as hell do. 

EDIT 3- I think that the concept of time was on their minds since the pilot, although it is ignorant to think that they had every aspect of how the show will represent these ideas throughout its run, from the get go.

THE DEFINITIVE AND UNIFIED EXPLANATION

Many people are torn about the Lost finale. Some feel it was a cop out. Some feel that the writers took the easy way out. Some do not like it because they wanted all the answers handed to them on a silver platter. Below you will find a total explanation of the show that sufficiently answers every aspect (of course, I may have forgot some. There is a lot of stuff). This is a combination of several different theories, and ideas of my own. We will go through the mysteries of the show one by one, so all of you feeling conned by the finale can hopefully get some closure and better understand things. Once again, these are not all of MY ideas. Many are borrowed, and put together in ONE UNIFYING EXPLANATION. 

 1) THE ISLAND

What was the Island? Why was it there? Did it have a purpose? Yes. It is believed by many that the Island was in fact the MAIN CHARACTER of the show. Stop for a minute and consider this: What if the entire show was not told through the characters perspective, but from the Island's?  In order to understand, let us examine what the Island actually is, specifically, what the light was in the center of the Island. In the episode ""Across the Sea"" Jacob and the Smoke Monster's mother shows them the light, and says a little bit of this light is inside every man, but no matter how much they have, they always want more. I believe that the light in the center of the Island... is TIME. Yes, I did say time. Here are some reasons for this:

1) You see the light each instance that there is a TIME jump in Season Five
2) Every man has a little bit of time (our lives) but we always want more, just like Jacob's mother said.
3) Jacob's mother goes on to say that the light is a physical manifestation of ""Life, death, and rebirth."" If this is true, then time fits the description almost perfectly. 

So if the light is time, then what does that mean?

If the light is time, then it means that it contains the past, present, and future. This means that the light in the center of the Island holds the memories of all of those ever to come to the Island. 

The Island gets the memories of those who go there?

Yes. What if flashbacks and flashforwards aren't JUST a storytelling device? What if the Island is able to GAIN ACCESS to someone's memories when they come to the Island? If the Light is a physical manifestation of time, then anything that comes to the Island instantly becomes part of its history. Thus, the Island stores the memories of its inhabitants. The flashbacks in seasons 1-3 aren't JUST a way of showing the character's history. They are representing the Island getting the memories.

From here, I want you to start thinking of the Island as a person. A living conscious being that has goals.

So what is the 'Island's goal'?

Its goal is to escape. You see, it is trapped, and cannot escape...from the future.

Could you explain that a little more please?

Sure. In Season Five, a multitude of characters are exposed to time shifts that move them along the Island's history. Locke, Sawyer, Miles, Faraday, Jin, and Juliet are sent back in time. These time jumps land them in many different eras. Pay special attention to one of the jumps, where the characters find the well. John Locke climbs down inside to adjust the wheel, hoping to end the time jumps. Let us quickly go through the history of this well: 1) It is built by the settlers who are searching for the core of the Island, and is used by the Smoke Monster to build the wheel. 2) Jacob's mother fills in the well in attempts to stop him.
3) Our losties jump back in time to somewhere in between numbers 1 and 2. John goes down the well. 4) There is another time jump, and the well vanishes.

This means that at the time of Number 4, they are BEFORE the settlers came. Before the Man in Black and Jacob were there. And at this moment, the Island gets the memories of Locke, Sawyer, Miles, Faraday, Jin, and Juliet. All of the things these people have seen and done in seasons 1-4, the Island now knows.

So what does this mean?

Basically, the Island now knows what is going to happen in the future. It has the memories of Juliet, Sawyer, Faraday, Miles, and Locke. This means it knows what will happen for the next TWO THOUSAND YEARS. And because of the rules of ""Whatever Happened Happened"" it has no choice but to carry these things out. How is it supposed to carry out the future? It's an Island.  That's the thing. It can't on its own. The Island itself cannot make all of these events occur out of thin air. It needs someone to help. And that's where Jacob and the Man in Black come in. Now remember, in the center of the Island is Time itself. The Light. And within this light, the past, present, and future of the Island is stored in memories. As we see in the show, the Island (if it wishes) can piece together memories into dreams, or visions, which it will then show the characters. Remember, it is depending on these people to free it in the end.   So Jacob is the one appointed by the Island to bring people there to play out the pre-set future?

Yes. And Jacob's mother was the one before him.

Then what is the Smoke Monster?

There is a perfectly logical explanation for the Smoke Monster, I assure you, and all of its rules and properties. However, first I'd like to cover the history of the Island so you have some background.

Alright. Explain the history, then lets get back to that Smoke Monster.

I'll try to make it quick.
Several thousand years ago, the Island was not an Island at all. It was just a piece of land, in Tunisia to be exact. Ancient inhabitants lived here, Egyptian in descent. At some point in time they discovered the cave, and the light within. They built several structures around the area, including a statue of Tawaret, a temple, and series of waterways and tunnels underneath the ground. How did it become an Island? What were these waterways for?

The Egyptians discovered the cave, and began to manipulate the light within. We know this because the last episode ""The End"" we see a large Egyptian structure built over the light. It is submerged in a pool of water, with a stone pillar blocking the opening.

What was that structure doing?

Well, In the Episode ""Across the Sea"" the Man in Black says that he is using the donkey wheel to manipulate water and light, which in turn moves the Island. We can assume that the Egyptians were doing the same thing.

So what does that mean? Manipulating the water and the light? Was was the stone pillar and the wheel doing this?

Well, before the Egyptians found it, the light/time moved freely, slowly draining from the reservoir. However, the Egyptians designed a system where the light is covered in a pool of water.
When light passes through water, it is refracted, and bent back to the medium. This means that the light (or time in this instance) will be turned around, and sent backward to where it came from. We know from Season Four that the electromagnetism within the Island forms a field around it.
So, when the light in the cave is refracted back by the pool of water, the land caught in the electromagnetic field is moved to previous times and spaces that it has been. And since throughout the Precambrian, Paleozoic, and Mesozoic era the continents were constantly shifting, it is very possible that the land had been on many different places on the Earth's surface. Submerging the light in water is what causes the Island to move, by refracting it backwards, and in turn, sending the Island to previous locations and times in its past.
Today, there is about a two mile wide crater in Tunisia. Is it possible that this area was the Island? And that 'crater' is where the Island once was?
I suspect that the Island continued to move through time and shift position after it had departed from Tunisia. It was moving constantly. However (as we know from season five) this has negative physical effects on people. In order to stop the jumps, the Egyptians placed a large stone pillar in the pool to stop the light from refracting back inwards. This effectively stopped the time and space jumps. However, the regular flow of time was now disrupted. The light was not coming out freely anymore. It was inhibited. The pillar began to slow down the Island’s time. I do not mean time slowed down for people, animals, and plants on the Island. I mean the original land. The stone and earth and rock's aging is near stopped.
Before continue, I would like to make distinctions between different pockets, or ‘reservoirs’ of the light/time around the Island.
The Source/Heart of the Island: Located just beyond the bamboo forest where Jack wakes up. It is the largest pocket on the Island, and is the central holding place for the majority of the energy. Since Egyptian times, this pocket has been flooded in water and then plugged. It’s release of energy is minimal
The Swan Station: Also called ‘the hatch’. This pocket is buried deep underneath the ground as a reservoir of light. It was inactive until the DHARMA Initiative discovered it, and began to drill into the ground. In 1977, a nuclear blast from Jughead opened the pocket, and it was nearly all released. We will get to more on the hatch later.
The Orchid: Discovered by Roman settlers, after the Egyptians, but before DHARMA. A well was built over it, as well as a wheel. When the wheel is turned, it will open a waterway that allows the pocket to be flooded, which in turn causes light refractions and the Island moving. Theoretically, the water should drain out after the wheel has been turned. However, it is very old, and was jolted from its axis when Benjamin Linus turned it. It is hypothesized that the water drained out, but the light was not effectively plugged afterwards and continued to sporatically release causing time jumps.

Here is a review of some of the basic concepts:
1) The water refracts the light, bending it back to the medium. This causes the Island to move back to places it had been in the past.
To stop the Island moving, the Egyptians place a stone pillar in the pool. This pillar effectively blocks the light from refracting, but slows down the flow of the light itself, causing the time of the the Island to SLOW DOWN.
The Swan and Orchid station are reservoirs of time that were inactive until discovered by DHARMA, and the Settlers.

2. DESMOND AND THE FLASHSIDEWAYS

Now that the Island's history has been explained, we can move on to some of its bigger mysteries, such as Jacob and the Smoke Monster. However, first I would like to cite some information about Desmond Hume, and explain what the Flashsideways is that we see in Season Six.
Remember, the Island is trapped. It cannot change what it saw when the time travelers landed. It has to carry out the future. It is forced to bring people to the Island. It is forced to tear Desmond away from Penny and crash Oceanic 815. Basically, it is forced to pull these people away from their lives to fulfill their destinies on the Island. And many of them will die there.
Now we will take a look at the effect of the Island holding the memories of all the Island’s inhabitants. 
Our personalities are made up from memories. They define who we are, and determine a large portion of your personality. The side-effect of the Island holding all of these people’s memories is that a sort of dream world is created. A world FULLY FORMED from the memories of those people on the Island. I believe that once someone has been on the Island, when they die, they will not REALLY fully die. This is because their memories still exist SOMEWHERE, which means that THEY still exist somewhere. This is the flash sideways. It is the dream world that they all created together, constructed from their memories by the Island.

Thanks LOST.,Love_Science_Pasta,176,34,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/eogxr/i_pulled_a_des_in_real_life_worked_out_thanks_lost/,"So I met the girl of my dreams just before I left to go sailing in another part of the world. I gave her a copy of “Our Mutual Friend” as a going away present and told her to hold onto it as it has “unique electromagnetic properties” (stuck a hard disk magnet under the cover amongst other things) Anyways, while driving her to the airport I realized that love sick actually means vomiting in real life and is not just a sissy metaphor for how lesser men describe their feelings. I'd been through two and four year relationships, thought I knew about love, girls and life in general but this was something completely new. It was real physical “take a paracetamol” pain in the chest.

Fast forward a year of being miserable and forever alone. We're on a mountain at midnight, in complete silence. So quiet I could hear her hand brushing back her hair. She had brought the book and told me how it reminded her of our nights in, curled up watching LOST. Before I can say anything she completely ruins my intricate plan and tells me she loves me. So I turn off the light and then turn on a UV dark light. The book lights up in a dazzling luminous green. On the last page after a long letter are the words “I love you Rachel and I'll never leave you again”. Tears were had. It's been happy ever after since.

1365860710.0,133,self.lost,1c9no2,I just finished watching the greatest series I'll ever see. My thoughts on the finale.,JehuLove,157,24,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/1c9no2/i_just_finished_watching_the_greatest_series_ill/,"I don't watch a lot of television. The shows I've watched chronologically and followed to conclusion can be counted on one hand. What I do like, and what I've devoted my creative life to, is storytelling. I prefer ""storytelling"" to writing or dictating. Storytelling is an inexact science. There's some guesswork involved- it's an experience for the listener and the storyteller. It's sometimes disappointing. A bad storyteller can ruin the best of tales- conversely, a skilled storyteller can make the most predictable child's fairytale into something close to an epic, and you'd never forgive him if he didn't put his all into the last line- even if it is, predictably, ""and they all lived happily ever after.""

It was obvious going into the last season that there would be no perfect resolution to every mystery, subplot, and inconsistency. After watching some older episodes, though, I was sort of amazed at the number of clean, interesting explanations we DID get along the way- and I'm grateful they weren't ham-fisted and usually required the viewers to make some of the connections on their own. All I asked from this finale was one thing- it needed to ""feel right."" 

It felt absolutely right. 

There were some missteps. I'm still perplexed about why Jin and Sun were reunited in the purgatory world without their daughter (as she wasn' ""born"" yet....and yet actually existed in the ""real world."" Meh.) I'm unsure why Sayid was with Shannon in the purgatory world instead of Nadia, although I suspect it has something to do with the fact that he was the one character who, even in the flash-""sideways,"" was never able to completely let go of his flaws and mistakes (if you remember his conversation with Hurley)- and he'd always considered himself undeserving of her. I was impressed that without really noticing it, by the end of the Season 6 flash-""sideways,"" though, every character (except for Ben and possibly Sayid - which is fitting) were able to move past the worst parts of themselves in life; this, of course, because of the experiences they shared together and the ""place"" they created to find one another, forgive, love, and let go. This is what Desmond provided- whether you explain it through electromagnetism or spirituality, he glimpsed this place as far back as the end of season two- and the understanding of fate AND choice it afforded him was able to tie them back to one another and come to peace with both the hands fate dealt them AND the decisions they made. 

The most important line of the episode, I thought, came from the one who transcended both storylines and understood exactly how the pieces fit - ""there are no shortcuts, no do-overs. What happened, happened. All of this MATTERS."" 

The lack of detailed mythology explanation -- to me-- made the Island make more sense. The ""Magic Box"" Ben and Locke talked about early in the series was in reference to the Island's ability to make miraculous things happen--I think that was always the intended metaphor. A spinal surgeon falling from the sky when you're dying of spinal cancer... becoming inexplicably unable to die when something more important requires you to live... discovering the ability to walk when broken... unexpected family reunions or fateful showdowns with the past when needed... And so on.  

The ""heart of the Island"" was the most wonderfully understated, subtle source of dreams and miracles and wishes. It could allow you, ultimately, to make a place beyond the world and time and space and matter and even spirit where some could have happiness- those who were there to experience it firsthand, and those the Island chose. This is a character drama, a mystery, science fiction, and a fantasy- an element like this isn't out of place, and needs very little in the way of more explanation. I loved it. 

There was a lot I loved. It was Hurley- of COURSE it was Hurley. He was the only innocent- the only one who, while flawed, always ""took care of people""- and that's why we all loved him. We wanted only the best for our favorite characters, and so did he. Much of the struggle between Jack, Locke, and Ben was about the question of leadership- and whether the best leaders are the ambitious who seek it at all costs, or those truly good souls who have leadership thrust upon them, and make the choice to accept it, even if reluctantly. 

I loved that Jacob and the Man in Black weren't Egyptian gods. They weren't good and evil incarnate. They were just guys. Powerful guys, with the ability to create their own rules and pull strings in attempts to bring about their wishes, but when all was said, just a couple of brothers. Flawed, broken brothers, whose mistakes had no easy fixes. No do-overs. All of this matters. 

I loved that Juliet's line ""it worked"" had nothing to do with the bomb- it was in reference to the vending machine. 

I loved the final scene between Jack and Christian. I loved the implications of the stained-glass window in the room with the coffin. I loved that there was no music during their conversation. I loved that even if at first, my mind rejected what I was hearing and seeing, and it broke my heart, there was no other way it could have been, and I bought into it completely. Some tears were shed- of course they were- whether we wanted to or not, we were forced to say goodbye to everyone. ""Everyone dies sometime, kiddo."" If this wasn't gut-wrenching, we'd never cared about them in the first place. But it was, and we had. 

I loved the last lines between Ben and Locke. Everything that needed to be said was said. Locke, at the end of the day, may not have been as special as he'd hoped- and he may not have saved them all as Charlie had expected, but as he said in Season One, he'd seen the heart of the island- and it was beautiful. At the end of the day, he was right- and his faith was justly rewarded. 

I loved the last lines between Hurley and Ben. No doubt it would have felt ""wrong"" to have Ben move along with everyone else- even in a place where time doesn't exist, he needed more of it. Ben still needed to atone, to discover who he really was, to make his peace- or perhaps he just needed a little more time with Danielle and Alex, living in a peaceful world that, even if fabricated, was necessary.  

For the major unanswered questions, I have my theories and I'm content to believe in them. And it's good that they left some things open to discussion and interpretation. It's good for a mystery show to retain some aura of mystery- in fact, in the context of this finale, I could have done without some of the explanations they DID give- the ""whispers,"" for example, or Richard's entire ""Ab Aeterno"" episode- it was good, but added little to the overall experience. 

As for the untold stories that continued in ""the real world"" after Jack's death, I can spend my time imagining all the mysteries, island myths and answers that Hurley and Ben were made to tackle in their years, or possibly centuries, after the Man in Black was destroyed. I wonder if Ben took MUCH longer to redeem himself after attempted power grabs and the temptation of falling back into his old scheming habits. I get to wonder what an elderly Richard was like, with his centuries of wisdom, trying to re-integrate with a world that's long passed him by. I can think about whether the Man in Black was lying to Jack and maybe our visions of Christian Shepard on and off the island WERE, indeed, Jack's father intervening from a previously unconsidered perspective. I can wonder how or if Desmond ever got home. I can consider the implications of newer threats to the island, whether it's another set of survivors, Hurley having an existential crisis, or maybe a new incarnation of DHARMA, returned to try once again to understand the island's unique properties.  

And I can do that knowing that it can all fit.  

""There are no shortcuts, no do-overs. What happened, happened. All of this MATTERS."" In a sense, this is the voice of the writers. ""We know what we've given you is imperfect. We're storytellers around a campfire, and some of these things we came up with on the spot because we loved the look in your eyes as you sat on the edge of your seat and roasted marshmallows, and we got as caught up in its mystery as much as you did, hoping you were having as much fun listening as we were having telling it. We don't have the ability to go back and fix our mistakes, but if you've followed this long and cared about these characters along the way, even if it is flawed, it MATTERS.""

Also, how awesome was Richard's acting? Pulled it off so well!

Update: Also, what about Jacob's quote: ""The past doesn't matter here."" That works against everything that Lost has been based around for the past few years!

Interesting point brought up by [PullTheOtherOne](http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/bhe11/ab_aeterno_6x09_discussion/c0mseu1?context=3): 
&gt;MiB says ""Whenever you decide to side with me, you'll be with your wife again""
A few hundred years later, Richard yells ""I was wrong about Jacob, I'm on your side now.""
Instantly, Hurley shows up and Richard is with his wife again. Looks to me like MiB kept his promise and is tricking them (and us) into believing it's Jacob's work.

I'm not saying it was completely bad and let me first discuss what it did right:

**The island's purpose was, at least in some sense, revealed.** The whole 'it has a magic light in it' from Across the Sea was not good enough. However, it appears that the light is what allows people to cross into the afterlife and so what they did on the island was important because it is what allowed  them to 'move on' at the end from the FS world.

**Jacob did have a plan.** Widmore really did talk to Jacob and bringing Desmond to the island was necessary to bring down MIB. Just like Sawyer had to unplug the vending machine to let the candy fall out and then plug it back in, Desmond had to unplug the island to allow MIB to be killed and then Jack plugged it back in for him.

Letting the characters have closure was important. It was necessary for us to feel like the story was over and this is what most people liked about the finale but it leads me to what was wrong about the finale.

**We watched the show because of the mysteries of the island.** I'm not using hyperbole when I say that every single person I talked to about the show thought that the flashbacks and character histories were the most boring parts of the show. I definitely cared deeply about the characters by the end and got very emotional seeing them reunited, but the people who stuck with the show stayed because they wanted to know what the secrets of the island were. The few who bailed on the show said it was because the plot just moved too slowly and too little was revealed. The driving force behind why we watched the show was to understand the mythology, not to see the characters resolve their emotional issues.

**The show runners used a trick from BSG that pissed a lot of people off.** People had been saying for years that the island was purgatory and the creators vehemently denied it. So technically they were right in that the island wasn't but when people asked if the show was about purgatory they denied it this whole time so that at the end they could say ""Haha gotcha. It really was about purgatory."" On BSG they did the same thing by telling people that one planet was Earth so that at the end they could say another planet was Earth. It was lame then and it's lame now.

&gt;Chris: Hey Meg, try to think of the word I'm thinking of, and it's not kitty.

&gt;Meg: I don't know... banana?

&gt;Chris: Aha, it was kitty!

**Comparisons to Star Wars not explaining the force, etc. are bad analogies.** When we watched Star Wars, the burning question was not ""How does the force work?"". That's not why we watched. We were introduced to a universe where the force was basically the norm and we accepted it immediately. We cared about Princess Leia being saved and the rebels defeating the empire and that's what we got in return.

However with Lost, we were presented with supernatural mysteries and we were *supposed* to question what they were. That's how they got us to watch the show. It's not accurate to say they lured us in with the mythology and then steered us to really only care about the characters. For years up until the finale the show was hotly debated and what people were discussing was the mythology. Even now, it's clear that's why most everyone watched the show.

I can't help but think that many people are trying to convince themselves that the end was amazing because there's no way we're going to get anymore answers. I have to state the contrary though, because Lost deserved better.",,False,,t5_2qhag,False,,,True,t3_c7ljs,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/c7ljs/what_we_watched_for/,

Every now and then on this subreddit, someone brings up the idea of starting a subreddit-wide re-watch. Many people in the comments agree, but then it never actually happens for one reason or another. Well, let’s start a re-watch for real this time, and if people feel like participating, that will be great. Here is how it will work:

Next Tuesday (one week from now) I will make a post entitled “Lost Re-Watch Episode 1X01, *Pilot, Part 1*” I’ll make a post like that every Tuesday after that, one for each episode. In that post, I will link to the Lostpedia article on the episode and ask some generic questions, such as “How would you grade this episode?” “What is something you noticed this time that you didn't notice the first time (foreshadowing, continuity errors, etc.)?” “What was your favorite line from this episode?” “Was there anything you really disliked about this episode?” etc. People can answer those questions in the comments and hopefully that will lead to some good discussion.

A bunch of attempted re-watches failed after a few episodes or didn't even begin, but I really hope this one will work because you won’t actually have to watch the episode in order to participate. It won’t really be about re-*watching* the series, per say, more about just having a chance to discuss each episode individually. There are a lot of great episodes of Lost that we never really discuss, and I hope that this will help with that!

Feel free to tell me what you think of this. Even if you don’t think it will work, I’d love to at least give it a try. If you have any suggestions for questions to ask about each episode, or other suggestions, please let me know!

**Edit:** Alright, I'm looking at everyone's suggestions and here's what we'll do. Instead of doing one episode a week on Tuesdays, we'll do two a week, one on Mondays, one on Thursdays. Some people have suggested doing multiple episodes per post, but I think it would be best to stick to one per post. The reason I wanted to do this was because there are so many episodes we never discuss individually, and I'm pretty sure that if we discussed multiple episodes at a time, a lot of them would end up being ignored. Also, I will title the posts ""Episode Discussion 1X01, *Pilot, Part 1*,"" rather than ""Lost Re-Watch Episode 1X01, *Pilot, Part 1*,"" to emphasize the fact that this is about discussing episodes and not necessarily just re-watching them. We'll test this out and tweak it as needed. See you all on Monday!",,False,,t5_2qhag,1370448753.0,,,True,t3_1fngsk,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/1fngsk/lost_rewatch/,

I jokingly posted more than once that I expected Jack to die and Hurley to take over (check my history I guess lol), but Ben's direction was unexpected.


Why I loved it...

- Everyone worked to save him from being trapped under the tree (instead of leaving him, because of his past deeds).

- He got to stay on Island, and was given the position directly under and in communication with ""Jacob"", that he wanted so badly.

- Hurley gave him that job because he really needed Ben's help, and trusted him. The sincerity in Hurley's request, and in Ben's acceptance of the job, indicated a new era on Island was being ushered in.

- Ben said to Hurley that things can be done differently than how Jacob ran things. Ben has seen first hand the damage faith in Jacbo's rules could cause, and it seems he will/did use that experience to make Hurley's run as leader better.

- Hurley's said Ben was a great number two, and Ben said Hurley was a great number one...which makes me think that Ben followed Hurley's possitive direction. A journey that may have even redeemed Ben.

- Ben didn't go with the Oceanic's at the end. I think this was becasue of Alex, perhaps he needed to ""wake"" her in order to move on with her (and possibly Rouseau too).

All in all, it was great to see Ben given what he truly wanted once his character evolved to where he could do it with a good heart.",,False,,t5_2qhag,True,,,True,t3_c7jm2,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/c7jm2/6x17_ben_linus/,

Everyone has a different definition of what they consider to be a spoiler. Some people prefer to know every detail, some just the ""minor"" details about upcoming episodes.
  
Here is a compilation of the details of the upcoming episodes, fragmented, masked and outlined--with specific information for next week's episode--in a way that you can take in as much or as little as you please.

I will try to update this as frequently as there is information, and at least once or twice per week until the finale.

If instead of just ending it at Season 6 (like they should have at the end of S7 in XF or the Office) they kept the show running, focusing on secondary characters (Hurley, Ben, Claire, Sawyer, etc) while the main actors that wanted to move on (Locke, Jack, Kate), left the show and only came back as reoccurring characters on really important episodes like Duchovny did in XF S8 and 9.

Where do you think our characters would be for a plot two years later? Which questions would have been answered by now? Who would have been killed off? How many shitty characters like Paolo and Nikki would we be introduced to? Would LOST have it's own spin off or two by now? Different opening credits? Would you still watch the show at this point or would you have given up when the show eventually started sucking?

Just think if we had a Richard centric episode 2 seasons ago. A lot wouldn't make sense and it would also completely ruin the set up of other characters - mainly Jacob and MiB. Richard is a character who has a lot of dealings with some big answers, hence not seeing a lot of him until a time when we are ready to have those parts of the story and characters exposed. And when we do get a Richard centric episode, it is so full of detail, it does not flash between times due to the sheer volume of content, which I'de assume they've been itching to give us.

1331459128.0,96,self.lost,qrdyx,This show is absolutely life-changing...and anyone who disagrees can go fuck themselves. Here's why.,TPaine16,138,42,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/lost/comments/qrdyx/this_show_is_absolutely_lifechangingand_anyone/,"Ok, so I'm absolutely hammered right now. It's past 5 am, I've had a bad day, and I'm not exactly in a very good place in my life right now. I have a lot of issues that I've gotta deal with. This will probably earn by a lot of downvotes, but I really, *really* don't care. I have no filter right now. Everything I am saying is coming straight from my heart. I am not exaggerating, I am not being sentimental, and I am not trying to be overly dramatic.

Say what you want about the ""ending."" Say what you want about it not perfectly wrapping up every last little mystery that the show had. I honestly do not give a fucking shit about that stuff. Would it have been nice to learn a bit more about Walt? Sure. Would it have been cool to know the true significance of the numbers? Hell yeah. But at the end of the day, all that stuff is completely trivial. It doesn't matter. It's bullshit. In twenty years I'm not going to be wondering about what the numbers were. I'm going to be reflecting on moments like this one: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-N7KOGnATgM

It's now 5:26 am, and I'm sitting alone in my room, utterly wasted, watching this clip over and over again, with tears in my eyes. I don't cry very often. I cried when my best friend died a few years ago, but other than that I can't remember the last time I legitimately shed tears. Admittedly, I am drunk so that sort of enhances the emotions I'm feeling right now, but it also reveals an innate truth to them. This fucking show has changed my life. It has done things for me no therapist, no friend, or no family member has ever been able to do. It has made me hopeful. It has made me a better person. Truly. No bullshit. 100%. It has made me a better me.

Locke's pain in this season is almost impossible to watch. It's extraordinarily difficult to endure. Why? Because we all feel his pain in this moment. We ALL know what it's like to be completely and utterly confused and lost in life. No direction, nowhere to go, nothing to rely on, everything spinning out of control. His frustration, anger, and sadness resonates so well with me that I literally struggle to watch this scene anymore (at least not without crying). Like I mentioned earlier, I'm in a pretty shitty place right now. I am not suicidal by any means but I am seriously having a hard time just getting by. This show is one of the ONLY things that keeps me grounded. It is one of the ONLY things that keeps me motivated.

I know it's silly to say this about a television show, but that's not what it really is to me. It's not a TV show. It's almost like a religion. It's a code that I've adapted. It's essentially a way of life that I've tried to abide by. Let go. Move on. Tomorrow will be a better day. Have hope. When people say they hated LOST because the ending ""ruined"" the show -- that fucking pisses me off to no end. I can no longer be friends with those people. I can no longer even interact with them. They mean nothing to me. Someone with that shallow a mind does not even deserve to appreciate the true meaning of LOST. Nor do they deserve my friendship. I'm not kidding. I can't associate with people like that.

At the end of the day, LOST has multiple other moments like the one I linked (Locke banging on the hatch door) that has the ability to change lives. It is capable of connecting with people on such an visceral level that it literally changes the way they see themselves and the way they go about living their lives. LOST wasn't a television show, it was a fucking therapy session. Only it was in the form of an incredibly interesting and compelling hourly drama. 

Anyone who has watched LOST in full knows what I'm talking about. Even the people who hated the ending. They can't deny it. They may never admit it publicly but they know in their heart of hearts what this show means to them. It is inspiring. It makes you want to get more out of life. It gives deeper meaning to the things you do care about. It forces you to look inwards to find your strengths and your weaknesses. It does so many things that a television show has no business doing. Television is supposed to entertain you. It's supposed to give you an escape to another world or reality where you don't have to confront the problems of your real life. While LOST certainly offers escapism, it doesn't quit stop there. It makes you confront those problems. It makes you understand what it is to be a human being. It doesn't give you the choice.

That's about all I've got. I hope I'm downvoted for this. I really don't care if nobody reads this and it falls off the front page quickly. That doesn't matter at all. I really just needed to get this off my chest. I needed to tell SOMEONE. My friends wouldn't understand. I do have a lot of friends who watched LOST, and while most of them loved the show, they wouldn't get what I'm saying right now. They'd think I'm fucking insane. They would think this is just the alcohol talking and that I need to chill out or some shit. I won't lie, this post wouldn't have happened without the alcohol, but that doesn't mean that anything I have just said isn't true. It's all totally real. I am being as sincere as I possibly can. Truly. In the name of Jacob, I swear.

LOST changed my life. If you can't find the beauty in this show then...I don't know. Fuck you.

Namaste and good luck,

TPaine

First thing is I'm convinced that Mother was the Smoke Monster until she was killed.  How else can you explain how she killed all the settlers and caved in the well?  She regarded that fate as ""much worse"" than death when she told Jacob never to go down there.

Mother had always wanted Nameless to become the protector of the Island (Smoke Monster) because she knew, apparently, that sometimes to protect the Island, you'll have to do bad things, like lie and kill, things we found out Jacob either can't or won't do.  When Nameless ran away, she was forced to manipulate things.  That's why she took Jacob to the Source that night.  To get into his head that the worst punishment of all would be to enter the cave of light.  Then, she told Jacob, falsely, that he would need to protect the Island, in hopes, perhaps, of him keeping is brother on the Island.  That is, if the Smoke Monster can leave the Island anyway.

So, Smokey is, unknowingly, protector of the Island, and Jacob is the figurehead.  Which might be the system Mother had planned all along.

""But, how did Nameless kill Mother if she was the Smoke Monster?,"" I hear you ponder.  Well, quite simply, he followed the rules.  He stabbed her (maybe with a knife imbued with the magnetism of the Island) without letting her speak (or speaking to her).  That's how you take down Smokey.

What do ya think?
