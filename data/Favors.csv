That's how a subreddit measures its popularity and influence, and by unsubscribing you are effectively demonstrating that you are taking your business elsewhere.

1355846772.0,851,self.Favors,1520wd,[Request]I am deaf and I would like a video of my late Grandfather captioned.  I can't understand what he is saying and I would really like to.,Whoa_Bundy,995,144,206,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/1520wd/requesti_am_deaf_and_i_would_like_a_video_of_my/,"I've had this video for years where he did an interview for the Canadian legion and talks about his experiences during WW2.  However two things prevented me from watching it.  Youth and I'm deaf. 

He was alive and I was 17 when I got a copy of it.  I'm now 32 and he has since passed away.  I watched the video and teared up just seeing him but I can't understand what he is saying.  I would love for this to be captioned.  

The video is 38 minutes and I know this can be very time consuming.   

If anyone has a suggestion for a website that I can pay to have this done, I welcome them. 

Most sites I've found will send you the transcript but I would like someone to encode the captioning on the video itself.  I have it in .MP4 format and its about 470MB.

Thanks for looking

**EDIT** - Wow, I am overwhelmed by the generosity of you guys!  [I uploaded it to Dropbox](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/113048/Francis%20Bezaire.%20May%2014th%2C%201997.mp4
).  I'm not sure how we can work out who transcribes which part. 


Thanks again for the offers.  I can't wait to follow the video while reading the transcript.  

**EDIT 2** - I've gotten an offer from someone who is willing to encode the captions in the video itself and get it back to me.* 

**EDIT 3** - I don't want anyone give up their time if someone else has already completed it so as soon as I get either a transcript or a video with the captions included, I'll make sure I announce it.*

**EDIT 4 (Wed, 7:00am)** - Just want to throw out another quick THANK YOU for you guys who are tirelessly working on it.  I can see from some posts that it's taking some time.  There is a lot of dialogue to cover since I was told this is an interview.*  

**EDIT 5 - (Wed, 12:52pm)** - Well I just got a notice from Dropbox. ""This email is an automated notification from Dropbox that your Public links have been temporarily suspended for generating excessive traffic. Your Dropbox will continue to function normally with the exception of Public links. This suspension is temporary (3 days for the first time).""
 
Should I upload the video to YouTube?

What you guys are doing blows my mind. I work in technology and this is an awesome experience in itself seeing such a productive use of Google spreadsheet.

**EDIT 6 - (Wed, 2:15pm)** - I'm really at a loss for words at all the positive attention this is getting.  I'm not 100% sure where we are at right now.  I want to acknowledge the key players who have spent so much time on this and were here since the beginning!  And I also appreciate the newcomers who have come and offered their professional services!  As far as I know the video is now on YouTube (I didn't upload it and I haven't seen it since I can't access YouTube at work) but it sounds like the captioning is continuing from there. 

**EDIT 7 - (Wed, 8:10pm)** - Where to begin???  I feel like I've un-expectantly won an award and I'm now I'm trying to blurt out a half-way decent thank you speech.  I definitely have to identify those who took on this task, organized and ran with it from the beginning.  **[BoredOfCanada](http://www.reddit.com/user/BoredOfCanada), [killergiraffe](http://www.reddit.com/user/killergiraffe), [zenithyoda](http://www.reddit.com/user/zenithyoda), [i_am_sad](http://www.reddit.com/user/i_am_sad), [will93](http://www.reddit.com/user/will93), [thatfreakygirl](http://www.reddit.com/user/thatfreakygirl),** [Zhangar](http://www.reddit.com/user/Zhangar), [ad00m](http://www.reddit.com/user/ad00m), [lightquiver](http://www.reddit.com/user/lightquiver), [SirSamuelV](http://www.reddit.com/user/SirSamuelV), [khubbo](http://www.reddit.com/user/khubbo), [--Heisenberg--](http://www.reddit.com/user/--Heisenberg--), [ohlawditsafar](http://www.reddit.com/user/ohlawditsafar), [cincodenada](http://www.reddit.com/user/cincodenada), [gahbrielso ](http://www.reddit.com/user/gahbrielso), [ittersweet587 ](http://www.reddit.com/user/bittersweet587), [dTectionz](http://www.reddit.com/user/dTectionz) and those whose name showed up in the spreadsheet but I'm not seeing any comments posted by them here, kcreeks, dTectionz, epaka, ThoughtCloud, Danigickle, LavendarZombie, and Kick-the-Cheat.  If I missed anyone I'm extremely sorry!  

**EDIT 8 - (Wed, 9:30pm)** - I'm not 100 percent sure what to do now.  The transcript is completed and I'm working on getting that in my possession.  I've gotten offers from professional captionists, court reporters, transcription services, medical transcriptionist, and accessibility at Google.

So I believe what I have to do now is get ahold of the transcript file and possibly upload it to YouTube.  I was told that if I upload the transcript to YouTube  - without timecodes - and YouTube will use speech recognition technology to automatically align the text of the transcript with what it hears in the video, turning the transcript into live captions.

I also have replied to the professionals in the field and waiting to see the outcomes of those.

**EDIT 9 - (Thursday, 11:50am)**.  Using the final collaborative transcript that everyone worked on, [killergiraffe](http://www.reddit.com/user/killergiraffe), let me know it was ready.  I sent the video and transcript file to a professional captionist who graciously offered his services for free.  He will be encoding the video for me and then I'll upload it to YouTube with the captions.  I may have to re-send him the transcript files since there has been a few clarifications and edits recently.  I'll update when the video is online. 

I've tried to refrain from reading just the transcripts because I really want to the full impact of watching his facial expressions and body language as I read what he is saying on the screen.  I did give in and read maybe the first 5 minutes and I've already learned so much.  

I just want to say that if you have Grandparents still around, talk to them!  Learn from their experience and wisdom.  Don't do what I did and be a typical teen living ~~with your head up your ass~~ in your own world, caring only about yourselves.  I realize my Grandfather never talked about his experiences because I NEVER ASKED! I wish I spent more time just talking to him.  I'm very fortunate to have this video and even more so to be a part of this awesome Reddit community. 

**EDIT 10 - (Thurs, 6:45pm.)**  A big shout-out to user [snibe](http://www.reddit.com/user/snibe) who has graciously agreed to caption the video professionally!  He works as a captionist.  I can't wait to have a copy of the video, captioned, and on my hard drive.  Still working on getting in up onto YouTube and the transcript uploaded too.  I tried last night but it got stuck in the ""processing"" part.  Wouldn't finalize the upload.  

**EDIT 11 - (Fri, 10:07pm)** [snibe](http://www.reddit.com/user/snibe) has sent me the video with the official and professional looking captioning on it.  It looks just utterly fantastic!  I can't express my gratitude enough for snibe and everyone involved in this project. 

I think this is going to be my final edit.  Or maybe just one more after I submit the video to YouTube with the captions forced/burned in instead of using YouTubes transcribe.  Just an idea.  Either way...what an experience and what an honor it was to be a receipt of this attention and Reddit generosity.

If you use Photoshop, make sure you are using the Apple color picker, not Adobe's.

The Red, Green and Blue areas of the wheel take up more of the spectrum, and align differently with it's compliments.  Crazy, huh? It's the reason why the ""feel"" of Pixar's color palettes were so dramatically more alive than the palettes of other animation houses at the time... they were the first to switch completely over to Apple's wheel.

My best friend of life (let's call him John) has been my friend for 20 some years now....  It all started when we were wee lads experimenting with a sport doomed to confine us to basements and wooden cabins for years to come, that's right, the dangerous and dreaded *Role Playing Games*.  We've played all sorts of convoluted and dramatic games together with our close knit group of friends, and he started younger than me being classically trained by his father (a veteran of the original *Dungeons &amp; Dragons*) at the tender age of five.  

Enter le marriage proposal.  John finds a woman, awesome!  Has no more time for play group. ಠ_ಠ

So talking about what shenanigans he would like to have at his bachelor party we came up with a semi humorous fun time to have, tell everyone that we going out to a strip club or getting a stripper or whatever hotness that they can imagine and then instead lock ourselves in a house for six to eight hours playing d&amp;d.  Now I know what your thinking...lame.  But whatever this is for John, my best friend and that's what he wants.  So the idea is for a double-triple misleading fest of whats really going on.  The plan:

* Part One:  We tell everyone we're getting strippers
* Part Two:  Inform the bachelor party we're playing d&amp;d
* Part Three (This is where you come in):  You (the stripper DM) shows up and begins removing your clothes
* Part Four:  John wigs out about there being a stripper
* Part Five:  You DM until ?

Interested?  Check the requirements to see if you qualify: A)  A moderate to attractive female aged 18 to attractive. B) Someone familiar with d&amp;d 3.0, 3.5, or Pathfinder C) Must be willing to travel some bit (we live on the east coast of Maryland).  Fees can be discussed as we come to an agreement.  Thanks!

I'd like to use this money to purchase toys for any family who cannot afford them on their own right now (like a mini reddit ""Toys for Tots"" program?).

So, if you need assistance making this holiday a joyful one, place a comment here, and I'll PM you.  I suggest you comment rather than PM me, because I'll also reply to your comment which will let people know who I've helped, thereby allowing anyone else to join in and aid those I could not.  $300 won't go far, but hopefully others may step in.

I wish I could do this more because it was fun seeing the transformation, but all I can say is to never give up on your teeth and overall health of your mouth. Find a dentist that will work with you....they are out there I promise! Never give up hope. As you can see, we came a LONG way and I can guarantee you that KnightKrawler thought there may be nothing that could be done for his teeth. THINGS AREN'T AS BAD AS THEY MAY SEEM!

Here are the final pictures that we just took today when we took off his braces. Now he just needs to get his teeth cleaned and maintain proper home care and 6 month checkup/cleaning visits. Oh yeah...AND WEAR THAT DAMN RETAINER!! Haha.

There are more pictures in the links to the previous posts as well.

**EDIT 1**:
I have written to them (cc to principal). I told they tried to cheat me (explaining the file is an AOE3 lib) and if they needed more time they could just say ""i have no time, have a lot of another work to do"" or ""my grandma died"" :P We could make a deal (lose few points because they are late, etc). Also, I make clear they are underestimating the teacher doing that. I didn't say before, but I am in a Computer Science subject (yes, college!).
I told them they got a zero and they must have an ""A"" in the next paper to approve in the subject.
Today morning one of the students (my friend) wrote to me, but he just said bullshit.. ""ow I will talk to the others, we had the paper almost done, i dont know what happened...""
Tonight I have class with them, tomorrow I post more news.
ps: the principal did not answer yet.
And for those who complain: sorry for my bad english, not every teacher in reddit has english as mother tongue.

He probably doesn't even know who I am. But I have him friended here on reddit for a very specific reason.

http://www.reddit.com/r/Youngluck/ is that reason. Kleinbl00 is the reason Youngluck, a redditor who went to jail for making a mistake in life, got a reduced sentence.

Regardless of how much you hate him right now (and I'm not defending how he acted), the guy is genuinely a good person. He assisted a redditor, a real person, when they needed it most, and good things came of it. 

It's my opinion that groupthink has taken over, but it is the internet, so it will be forgotten next week. Kleinbl00's actions on reddit (and there are literally dozens more) have affected so many people in positive ways. More than all of you attacking him is affecting him negatively I'm sure.

I relied on the goodness of strangers to get me thru the months when my income had slowed to a trickle, and now that I am in a position to help someone who is struggling as I used to, I am prepared to help you get back on your feet.  
  
&gt;Kindly email me a picture of your most recent bill, and we'll get something set up.  This is not a loan, nor is it a handout.  This is just a man passing on the good fortune that he once had when he was down on his luck.

Imagine my surprise when my inbox was filled with [angry people](http://imgur.com/Wb3cm.png) saying nasty things. I follow the trail back to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/eo1u0/request_could_cornfedhonky_let_me_know_if_he_is/) post. Now, I want to make it clear that I did borrow $50 from allotriophagy, and immediately tried to clear that up in my first reply [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/eo1u0/request_could_cornfedhonky_let_me_know_if_he_is/c19livr) while standing in line at wal-mart. Basically, I created a post asking if anyone had an old Ps3 controller they wanted to sell for cheap or trade for, because my dog had chewed mine up and I was pretty broke at the time. I had just relocated to Florida, and purchased a condo so money was *very* tight, but I am by no means a poor person. When he initially made his offer to lend me the money, I thought it was a joke but then realized he was serious and since I had no other offers to sell or trade a controller, I took him up on it. At this point, I sincerely wish I hadn't.

There was some talk about paying the loan forward in /r/favors or donating it to charity. It's been over 6 months, so I honestly cannot remember the exact details. All I know is that I was under the impression that I would do something nice for someone else, and that would be that. If I had known that he wanted payment back, I would have paid him with my first paycheck. I don't blame alltriophagy for this confusion, the blame falls on me for not following-up and being certain. What can I say, relocating 2000 miles from home takes a lot of time and energy, and I just spaced. For that I apologize.

 Now, Allotriophagy has said that he has tried to message me. I'm still not clear whether that means on Reddit, or via email. With Reddit, I comment a lot and get A LOT of replies every day. Sometimes I just don't have time to check them all and they go unnoticed. If it was via email, I don't use my paypal email for my main personal account, so I definitely wouldn't have seen them there. I was not failing to respond to him on purpose, I genuinely did not know he had messaged me. 

That all being said, let's talk about the harassment, Reddit. The hate mail I can deal with. The comment stalkers, I can deal with. Hell, I can even deal with my name being dragged through the mud. What I cannot deal with, is my elderly mother being harassed on a daily basis for something that is a simple misunderstanding. I mean, he called me out, I addressed it and agreed to rectify it, and yet my mother still had her phone unplugged because some asshole tracked down my real name and somehow came up with her phone number. He/they have been calling her every day, telling her that they are ""recording her dumb ass for fun"" and making threats and calling me all sorts of unsavory and racist names. What the fuck is this? 4chan?  One specific threat was that he was going to come there and ""stick a red hot fire poker up her ass"". For this, she has had to unplug her phone from the wall. Do you know what that means, Reddit? That means that I cannot call to check on my elderly mother who has diabetes and has been known to go into diabetic shock in the past. She lives 2000 miles away, and I can't call her to check on her, or to wish her a merry christmas eve. That right there, that's fucked. 

All I can say is that this has been a huge eye-opener. I'm not a scammer, I'm not someone who was trying to get something for free. I'm someone who misunderstood the terms of a deal, and then agreed to rectify it ...[and did](http://imgur.com/oc8fU.png). I've been the biggest advocate of the Reddit community over the last few years. Ask my friends, I annoy the shit out of them constantly telling them what they're missing by not joining. I participate in all the secret santas, have helped out other Redditors in need in /r/favors, and have even let a Redditor down on his luck sleep on my couch for 2 weeks. But now, that faith and love I had has been tarnished with this ugly blemish. I'll most likely have to delete my account, since there is obviously enough personal info to track down my mother somewhere in it and I don't have the time to go through years of comments, and I most definitely won't be involving myself in /r/favors anymore. 

I know this means absolutely nothing on the internet, but we have called the police on my mother's behalf. Although I'm sure this won't deter you, I ask that you please leave her a lone. If you want someone to harass I will give you my home and cell number and you can do your worst on me. My mother is a retired hospice nurse who never did anything but help people, and she doesn't deserve this. 


P.S. I just want to point out that I in no way blame allotriophagy for any of the other issues that have stemmed from this. He has been nothing but a gentleman when we have spoken, and I know he wouldn't condone what's been going on. I don't want him to start getting hate mail from crazy people and start this whole ugly process over again. Thanks. 


**TLDR:** This was a big misunderstanding, he has been [paid](http://imgur.com/oc8fU.png) back his money, now please stop harassing my mother. Thanks.

He will grant me a couple minutes to speak in front of him.  I've been working on this speech for the better part of 3 months... and could really use the help from the brilliant minds of Reddit to help me hit this home. This is what I've got so far:

Dear Honorable Judge,

I not only acknowledge the atrocious mistake that I’ve made, but take full responsibility for it.  I realize that it has not only damaged my life, but also the lives of those that love and look up to me, an action that in and of itself could be considered a crime.  My sentence will be one that, no matter how lenient or severe, I believe I will be serving for the rest of my life.

I understand and respect that you have a job to do and by no means, under any circumstances do I expect you to do otherwise.  I only pray that while doing it, you not only take into consideration the crime I’ve committed, but also the human being that committed it.  The crime that was committed was not done with malicious intent, in fact it was not even committed with the intent of profit.  It was done with the sincere interest of helping a friend in danger. I am an Honors student at The Art Institute, one of the most respected art conservatories in the country.  I have written a Children’s Book, whose proceeds go to a charity that benefits the disabled.  I am a tutor for a Catholic School Child that suffers from a learning disability called Central Auditory Processing Disorder, who is willing to testify to the inspiring progress made under my tutelage.  I direct product strategy at an exciting new tech startup that aims at revolutionizing the way people interact with their computers.  But above all this, I am a dedicated father of a beautiful 6 year old boy.

I am 30 years old.  I am at an age where most citizens are are either laying down or building upon the foundations by which they will live the rest of their lives.  My biggest fear throughout this ordeal is that this mistake will throw me in a hole from which I won’t be able to climb out.  

I don’t consider myself, by any definition of the term, a threat to society.  In fact it has become a daily mantra of mine not to go to sleep until I feel I have contributed more to society than I have taken.  If there were such thing as a clause in which, should you show leniency in this matter under condition that if I was ever even caught jaywalking again, I’d get life in prison, I’d sign it without a single hesitation.
	
This is the human being that you are sentencing today. I beg your leniency, but fully respect the job you must do. 


That's all I've got so far.  It's really hard for me to write about myself... so please, feel free to take out, or add anything you think will be helpful.  Thanks in advance.

For that, I thank you.  In addition, Anomander and I did a little experiment - *what happens if we let all requests through?*

Well, as it turns out, what happens is that discussion in /r/favors switches from how to help people to *whether people deserve help.*  In addition to that, letting a few in became quite a force multiplier; we saw a jump in posts from people who weren't so much asking for a ""favor"" as they were asking for ""money.""  Hell, I got a half-dozen PMs from people directly asking *me* for help.  And that, to me, is not what this subreddit is about.

I've spent some time thinking about what, exactly, a ""favor"" is.  And I think I've figured it out:

###A ""Favor"" is something you ask of a peer.

As in, ""I'd totally send you a pizza, but I'm broke, so can you send me one?""  or ""I've got a bunch of old DVDs that aren't doing anything; I'd love it if someone sent me stuff they didn't need so that's what I'm going to do.""  ""Favors"" are the reason this subreddit exists.

###A ""Boon"" is something a supplicant asks of a superior.

As in, ""I'd really like someone to cosign my loan.""  As in ""I need help making my house payments.""  As in, ""I'm destitute and I don't know where else to turn, please help me out, I'm happy to prove that I'm totally broke.""

""Proving I'm totally broke"" is undignified.  I don't think it should be about ""worthyness.""  I think it should be about peers helping peers and when requests become huge like that, it overshadows everything else.  And everything else is why I started this subreddit.

So from now on, things that don't match what we, the moderators of /r/favors, determine to be a ""favor"" are getting punted to /r/Assistance.  [this /r/assistance?](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/d56cn/you_may_have_noticed_the_emergence_of_rassistance/)  Yeah, that's the one.  They've got qgyh2 and RedGPZ moderating over there now, though, so I trust 'em.

Thanks for helping in this grand social experiment, folx.  I heartily recommend the more altruistic of you to head over to /r/Assistance and subscribe.  This stuff needs to happen - but it doesn't need to swamp everything else.

I have been researching a bunch and i am finding it hard to put together an argument that does not involve questioning the validity of the video or pictures taken on the missions. Due to the fact i am not using any visual aids its going to be tough to explain the video and picture evidence normally used to beef up the hoax argument. So as a favor i need just a few solid points to make that do not involve the before mentioned and will not need the use of visual aids to explain away. Thanks for anyone who can help in any way!

Would be beyond grateful if someone could help me set up a blog?,youngluck,252,37,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/ara9u/request_im_going_to_jail_in_a_month_to_do_a_510/,"So I'll get the first question I know I'll be asked out of the way first: Why?

A: I was doing what I thought was a noble deed by helping a friend stay alive. My gut told me ""No""... my heart told me ""Yes""... I ran with my heart. It led to me getting caught with a lot of drugs. Non-violent crime... but sill... when I say ""a lot"" I mean a 10 year mandatory minimum ""a lot"".


Anyways, I like making art, as evidenced in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/apd76/offer_i_will_draw_you_a_spiffy_picture_of_almost/) thread, which actually advised me to ask for help with the blog.  I thought it might help pass the time with a creative outlet, and provide me the sense that I wasn't *totally* disconnected from the outside world. 


I figured a simple protocol would be for me to mail a weekly art piece accompanied by a written ""article"" about the fun, wonderful experiences one has in the federal prison system, to a 3rd party, who could scan the picture, and transcribe the writing in a CMS, like wordpress (or whatever you feel is best).


In an ideal world, my blog might look something like [this mockup](http://imgur.com/jFOmP.jpg) I did in Photoshop.  But in an ideal world I also wouldn't be going to jail... At this point I'd be willing to take whatever I could get.  I own the blackmarketarts.com domain name... and would be willing to pay for any and all expenses related to putting it up. Including whatever cash I can scrape together to pay you for your valuable time...


I know that some of you will look at the ad section of the mock up and have a hearty chuckle. But I have a 6 year old son, and am thinking of **anything** I can do to help shoot him a little money while I'm locked down.  Seriously, anything.  I'd also be willing to split that 50/50 with you if you'd like... and I know you're thinking to yourself... ""This fuckin' guy thinks people want to read his incarcerated drivel?... enough so that it would generate ad interest??? HAHAHA! The nerve!""... but I've generated a small but loyal following through my [music](http://www.myspace.com/thebottomdwellerz) and other [production](http://www.myspace.com/yukmouth) ventures. And any energy I have left after trying to stay alive in that bastard will be spent towards making this a success...



Anyways, that's my little plea for help. I understand the incredible talent it takes to put something like this together... and am willing to pay for that talent with whatever I got.  As a plan B, I'm fully comfortable with going the blogger.com route... I just aim high. HAHA... feel free to ask me any questions about **anything**, and I thank you all in advance for any advice, assistance or smart ass remarks you may provide (seriously)... I've grown fond of Reddit, and all that comes with it.


**EDIT**: Forward Progress: shart is gonna help me slice and CSS it up. I'm so fuckin' juiced.  **EDIT**: Dude disappeared on me.

**EDIT**: Judge gave me an extension to June 23rd...



**EDIT 2**: A couple of incredibly generous offers have come in. Couple of really good suggestions... I like wyrall's charity idea... a lot.

After reading what there is to read, you are inspired to write something on the topic at hand from your unique perspective.  Maybe it's a razor sharp quip or a relevant short story from your life.  You click the save button to share your masterpiece with the world, and almost immediately click edit to fix a grammar or spelling error for which you would certainly be mocked.  You click edit again and change the structure of one of your sentences for clarity.  There.  Perfect.  You continue browsing reddit, but keep it in the back of your mind to check on this comment later.

You browse another dozen posts or so, glancing now and then at the upper-right hand corner of your screen.  Still white.  Just give it time, a watched pot never boils.  Eventually it gets late.  You go to bed.

You log on to reddit the next day with curious anticipation.  What did people think of my comment?  Refresh.  White.  Your heart sinks.  You thought it was a pretty good comment!  What happened?  You click your way back to your comment.  Did it get downvoted to hell?  No, its there.  It actually got some upvotes, too.  But no one said anything about it.  No one replied to your comment.

But this time will be different.  This time your existence will be acknowledged on a far greater scale than a simple mouse click on an arrow planted beside your words.  This time you will enjoy basking in the bright orange glow of appreciation by having the opportunity to read the words of someone who wrote something back.  Just for you.  You are important and awesome and you may not be reddit-famous YET, but you will be.  Until then, I want you to have some intimate, quality attention for whatever you choose to express.

My 103-year-old grandfather (birthday May 18, 1908) and fantastic human being was recently diagnosed with congestive heart failure after no major health issues for the past 102 years. He has been hospitalized 4 times in the past 6 weeks since his diagnosis and is very depressed. He's taken the term ""heart failure"" quite literally and in my mother's words has ""turned his face to the wall"" and become very morose about everything since he keeps being told that his heart is failing. I am 1800 miles away and go home as often as I can, but I wish I could do more to cheer him up.

 He is a retired electrical engineer who loves baseball, the Yankees in particular, raised a family during the Depression, taught 3 generations of children how to ride bicycles and drive, has an encyclopedic memory of classic movies and is still quick with the one liners and puns. It breaks my heart that I can't be there with him more often and don't know how much time he has left. He has kept up with technology but not to the point where he can email, mostly since he never learned to type, but has a digital camera and printer that he uses to good effect, and thinks touchscreen technology is fascinating. (I submit this information to put in context his mental state. He's not doddering Grandpa Simpson, he's still very much a viable mentally sharp person). I thought about doing an AMA, but I'd have to shout questions into the phone, and it wouldn't be very efficient. 

If anyone wants to send him a card, i'm sure he would deeply appreciate it breaking up the monotony of his day. He lives with my mother, not in a nursing home or anything, but obviously doesn't drive anymore and I know he feels very trapped and bored. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd appreciate it! It's hard thinking of appropriate gifts for a housebound centenarian. PM me for his address if you're interested.    



   

**Edit 3** Sending him some pictures from where you are, or neat shots you've taken of any random thing, would really interest him. He loved developing his own pictures in his darkroom, it's the only downside to digital photography as far as he's concerned. Cheap, creative and heartfelt, the best kind of gift!    

**Edit 4** Postcards are a great idea too!    

**Edit 5** Wow, you guys are awesome. He is going to be so excited when all these random things start arriving, and more importantly they will keep his mind off his failing health. I am so grateful to you all for your generosity and can't wait to have my mom send me some pics of him to share with you.

Hey y'all! Wanted to give you an update on the progress we have made with our friend KnightKrawler. He is officially ""cavity free""!!! Roughly 18 fillings later we have finished :) We even got his broken tooth on the bottom front fixed.

Obviously, maintenance on the teeth is extremely important but at least right now he can rest easy that the decay that was going on will not get bad enough to cause him infection and/or tooth loss.

KnightKrawler has been awesome through this whole process, from being a easy patient to work on, to allowing me to post before and after photos for other Redditors to see.

I hope you enjoy seeing the transformation as much as I have. I have had a blast seeing the change and hearing that KnightKrawler even got a promotion at work from back-of-the-house to front-of-the-house in a restaurant! BADASS!!

Unfortunately they don't live by me for me to be able to offer my time and skills, but what I was thinking about doing is assisting a couple of people from the Orlando area and taking any sort of donation they would be willing to offer and sending that money out to her. Anyone think this would be a good idea? I am not sure what to do.....**

**EDIT 2: Thanks again everyone. I have contacted a couple of Orlando redditors that I felt were in the greatest need. I will post again, maybe some before and after photos, of the outcome.**

Under the sparkly tissue paper was a small card with an awesome drawing on it.  Inside was a card, from someone I've never met before, telling me to smile and be strong.  Damnit, who was cutting onions?!  Under the card was a burned CD full of happiness, covered in Reddit aliens.  And under that??

TOYS!!

Various pieces of candy, an easter egg painted like a shark full of jelly beans, a candy bracelet, a package of PB&amp;J crackers (sweet gods), a squirt gun and bubbles on a keychain!  BUT... the best part?

A travel size tub of peanut butter.

Yes, this made me cry.  You don't *know*, people.  Peanut butter barely exists in Japan.  It's the saddest thing ever, because it's one of my favorite foods.  And here was this wonderful person on the other side of the planet who read my mind and sent me a little peanut butter, a reminder of home.

Then shortly after Christmas, my mom found her face-down on the floor of her bedroom after having suffered a stroke.

She's been in a nursing home for almost three years now, and is only a shell of the woman she once was. I visit her as often as I can because she means the world to me, but I literally have to force myself to go. She talks about me constantly to the staff, but no longer knows who I am when I go to see her. She will talk about me in front of me, as though I were a complete stranger. And it absolutely breaks my heart.

I'm grateful she'll see this birthday for a little happiness, and will feel even luckier for her to make it to Christmas. But she's very rapidly approaching the end.

She's lived a full life and is one of the most compassionate, caring people I've ever known. And I'd just like to brighten her day by presenting her with a myriad of birthday cards. Homemade cards would be especially awesome.

I thank you all in advance for reading this.

**Hug your grandparents.**

Her name is Lona! I'm having all cards sent to my house because the staff at the nursing home won't open the cards for her, they just stick them in a drawer. I'm going to see her Saturday, so I'll be taking all of them with me.

I hope he will write something here so that you can see I am not f-ing around.

Also, there has been a great many people helping me out here and I want to thank all of you. In fact, there has been far more people wanting to help me give this place away than there has been people wanting to have it. Now I think that shows the good in people, no matter where you are from or what you do.

Some of the info dug up is that the house seems to have been boarded up by the city, there is a $2k lien and the neighbourhood is not exactly the best so chances are that the inside is not... Well I guess liveable would be an understatement. But again, none of us knows anything about the inside. I am still hoping for someone to drive past the property and have a peek if possible, maybe help EasyGuess out a little? He and I will do our best to sort out the paperprocess but if someone knows more about this I think I speak for both Eric and me that we would apprecieate any help!

[EDIT] Did I mention the house is in the [Google Fibre region?](https://fiber.google.com/cities/kcmo/#header=signup-eligible&amp;street_address=3418+Bellefontaine+Ave&amp;unit_number=&amp;city=Kansas+City&amp;state=MO&amp;zip_code=64128-1952&amp;addr_class=1&amp;addr_id=knssmo09738093&amp;addr_state=MO&amp;estimate_date=Fall+2013&amp;address_status=2&amp;fiberhood=knssmoopnf06&amp;addr_latlng=39.0636561567,-94.5477463569&amp;v=1351283796562&amp;flags=threshold-met) :D

Hi Reddit!
So I want to be perfectly honest about all of this and I will be as detailed as possible. The house it not a fancy one [Zillow](http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/3418-Bellefontaine-Ave-Kansas-City-MO-64128/2333805_zpid/) and I have never even been there. I live in Sweden my self and bought it as a stupid kid in 2008 as an investment.

I wasn´t scammed, the deed is in my name, but the company handling the process went bankrupt. Long story short, I own the house, have never been there, there is probably someone living there (squatter) and I have no idea about any propertytaxes or anything. I fucked up big time and this house is more of a headache than an asset and I want to get rid of it. So I thought why not give it to someone more deserving than me?

As you can tell I need help giving it away and I hope someone will be able to assist me in this.

[EDIT]
I have realized that this house will have a bunch of propertytaxes built up so this ""gift"" might not be for anyone. I would love to help and pay the taxes but I don´t have that kind of money. So again, this might only work for someone who has some possibilities on the financial side. That doesn´t change anything though. I would be just as happy giving it to someone who would flip it and make a few extra bucks, possibly for a family vacation to Kansas state or something (might not net too much :) I really don´t know, but I know that there are redditors out there or someone you know that this would be a perfect possibility for. Give me your best shot! Oh, and please check out [the game I am trying to make with two friends](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1153540957/the-ring-first-journey)
/EDIT

So give me your suggestions and let´s find someone a house before christmas!
I figured that maybe reddit will allow me to lift forward my first iOS game project thingy kickstarter event and hopefully get a boost. It would really mean a lot to me. The game is a action-version of the old ""buzzer game"" you used to play on carnivals where you have a metalring that you drag along a metal wire without touching. We just want to throw in some more elements like cannons, saws and other fun things. If you have any ideas you are more than welcome to help!

The below was also posted to r/NYC. 

Thanks !

My mother passed away yesterday after a four year fight with stage four breast cancer. This was her second bout with cancer, the first being back in 1998, when she fought and recovered, at least for a bit. We aren't particularly religious people, and mom never wanted a large ornate funeral; her one wish that she expressed more than once, was to have a large train of cars in her funeral procession. ""When I go, I want you to stand on the corner and convince people to show up for me.""
Mom's funeral service is going to be tomorrow, Wednesday January 9th at 12:30 in the afternoon at Schwartz Brothers Memorial Chapel at 114-03 Queens Blvd in Forest Hills. The burial is going to be at the Huntington Rural Cemetery in Huntington Long Island. If you've got nothing to do tomorrow afternoon and want some real life karma, please come out.

Thanks.


***edit added and date fixed OP here; first, sorry for the blunder. As my dad has pointed out, Wednesday is January 9th. Nice; sorry, I'm a little bit overwhelmed right now. second, it's definitely real. You can check the Sloan Kettering giving page if you like - I think I'm not supposed to post her name (mods, can I ?) or anything like that, but it's definitely real. third, yeah, it's a bit odd, I admit. Mom didn't necessarily want anyone to attend the service or burial (and I really would advise against it - life can be sad without attending funerals of random strangers) - she just wanted to avoid having a funeral procession of one or two cars and instructed me to get people to just follow. I think my mom wasn't quite aware of how many caring friends and family members she has - the outpouring of sympathy and concern has been quite astounding so this may all be overkill. But part of me thinks it'd be nice to have a flash-procession (like a flash mob). Mom would be psyched.

So, I took her up on her offer and sent her a PM. Then I waited for a good time to bring it up with my friends...

During that time I was getting to know a girl really well and I was very interested in her but we were not yet dating. We had become good friends over the past year or so and were hanging out with a group of friends. We have this ongoing argument/joke which would be hard to explain but it involves proving that the other person has ""a heart of gold."" So during one of our fake arguments I seize the opportunity to drop the Tanzania ""friend."" I say ""I bet you, even people in TANZANIA know about you and would agree with me that you have the heart of gold!"" She laughs and I just say ""just watch, I bet you."" Then I get home and PM ranautricularia again and set up what she should write and where to send it.

Fast forward 5 months and her and I are a month into our relationship and I pick her up for a date when she turns to me, wide-eyed and says ""Um...I got [the letter from your friend Manoni](http://imgur.com/Vb2qD.jpg)"" (She and I agreed it would be funny to make up some name, but it didnt cross my mind what she was talking about) ""...Your friend from Tanzania."" I wanted to burst out laughing I was so amazed he actually did it. But I kept my cool, started the car and simply said ""Oh what did it say?"" and she read it. To which I replied ""Yup, thats true. See I told you so."" and just kept driving like normal. She was completely dumbfounded. I could tell she was confused because she knows me and that I set this up somehow but didnt know how I pulled it off. She said ""Wow, you're the most awesome boyfriend ever!"" and I felt like a million dollars. 

Later, she told me that her mom had seen it and said ""Is everything okay with you two?"" Thinking I was in Tanzania or something hahahaha.

I want her to see the world and I think it would be better and more meaningful from the view of the people who belong in it.
I want to put the photos I get into a slide show for her with the names of the places so that she can see the world even though she can't visit it. 

If this pans out, I will try share the finished slide show here too, but I will have to figure that out, I'm not very technologically literate but my fella should be able to help me.

I wanna try a little behavior modification here, so I'd appreciate y'all cooperating.  

There's 20,000 eyes on this subreddit, presuming our demographic is not predominantly pirates or friends-of-Leela.^1  Of those 20,000-odd eyes, six of them belong to the moderators.  Which means things like our little ""I can't manage my books, buy me a pizza because I've got a $70k a year job but apparently no credit card"" dude get through sometimes.  I asked for sentiment on it, sentiment was overwhelmingly for ""ban it, ban it now"" so that's what I did.  That's what I'll continue to do.

Know what I didn't see, though?

*A single report.*

Not a one.  Not a single report.  I think this is because there's a misunderstanding about what the ""report"" button does.  So lemme explain:

**The Report Button does not ban things.**  It adds things to our ""reported links"" section as moderators, and it adds them, be they posts or comments, to our [Mod Queue.](http://i.imgur.com/yEgai.png)  This magical place fills up with everything that has either been trapped in the spam filter (for better or worse - for /r/realestate it's usually for the better, for /r/foodforthought it's usually for the worse) or reported by concerned citizens like yourself.

**Humans evaluate your reports.**  Nothing happens to a ""reported link"" or ""reported comment"" until I, ytknows or Anomander click *remove link.*

**Clicking the ""Report"" button is the equivalent of drawing the ref's attention to a foul play.**  The ref may not give you your foul, but he's more likely to give you one if he sees it than if he doesn't.  

It would honestly be a big, big favor to us, as moderators, if you clicked that button more often.  If you wanted to go the extra mile, you could even message the moderators - we aren't omniscient, we aren't omnipresent and this is a community-run community, even if only three of us wear striped shirts.

Do me a favor.  ~~Click ""report"" on this submission.  Do it now.~~^2  I'll tell you to stop at some point, but I want you to see that people keep commenting and stuff regardless of the fact that a submission has been ""reported.""

The system *does* work and we'd love your help in keeping it going.  Thanks for everything,

 - your friendly neighborhood moderator

*   *   *  

1) by the way, ever searched Google Images for ""Leela"" with safesearch off?  Fuckin-Rule-34-Inna-HAUS!  

2) Okay, you can stop.  This post has now been reported over 60 times and people are still commenting.  Note that if you report it, it'll go away for *you.*  That's the magic at work.

Here is the letter I printed out on vellum from santa:

My Dearest *X*,
The bright eyed little elf (that I believe you call cabby) who resides in your home  brought me your letter.  Oh how I thought and thought about your wishes and how I could grant them best.  You see, while I am magical, I sadly can’t transform humans.   I spoke to the Kings and Queens of the beasts and they felt strongly that you should not be turned to animal form.  You see my dear, they need you and people like you to remain human.  Animals require protection and care, and you my darling *X* are just the type of human that they look to for those very things.  The kings and Queens of the beasts were flattered by your desire to become one of them.  So much so that they did something I have never seen before!  Each of the Kings and Queens of the Council of Beasts put a bit of their spirits into a special container just for you. Their hope is that when you find yourself in need of a little something to help in your journey through life, that you will look to the bit of spirit that they gave to you for guidance.   I had my elves make you a special necklace that can hold just enough of the animal spirits to guide you through your journey.  Place a tiny bit of whatever animal spirit you require into the pendant and wear it as long as you need the aide of that animals spirit.  My animal friends and I are very proud of you *X*.  Your kindness to humans and animals alike is a big part of making your second wish come true.  World peace is something that can only happen when people like you go out into the world and  spread peace and love to all who inhabit this earth.  

Forever your friend,
Saint Nicholas

Any knife, axe, blade, of any steel, of any size, of any shape.  Recurves are no problem.  The exception is serrations.  If you send in a combination edge I will only sharpen the unserrated portion of the blade.  I can repair chipped or rolled edges, damaged tips, nearly anything.  I will not ruin the heat treat of your steel.  The edges will be convex, polished, and sharp.  
  
How?  I use aluminum oxide belts, 180x, 320x, 500x, 1200x followed by stropping with leather and veritas honing compound (0.5 micron).  I remove as little material as possible.  You get a shaving sharp, polished, convex edge.  
  
Why?  I am a knife enthusiast, an active member of /r/knives and bladeforums, and an outdoorsy person that enjoys using, maintaining, restoring and sharpening all kinds of tools.  I maintain my own high end tools (CRK, Busse, Gransfors Bruks, etc) and all sorts of things for friends and family.  
  
Fine print?  I am in Canada so it may or may not be worth your while to send in your knives.  You pay shipping both ways.  I'm not responsible for anything lost in shipping.  Once I send you the tracking number its yours.  Do not send automatics or balisongs or anything restricted in Canada.  It may take me a day or two to get your knives done and shipped back to you, depending on interest.  If you are worried about scuffs on you handles you might want to leave them in your safe.  I guarantee only reasonable workmanship.  I take pride in my work, but I'm only human.  These edges will be SHARP!  If you send in dull kitchen knives be sure to inform anyone using them that they have been sharpened, or they will cut themselves!  
  
Tips:  Not accepted.  Pay it forward.  This is a favor and I do it for my own personal enjoyment.  The belts and compound that I use don't cost very much and I don't mind supplying them.

So I thought I'd try this shiny new subreddit.

The short version: I put myself in financial peril by taking time off work to assemble a book.  It was released last July, and everyone who reads it seems to really enjoy it (e.g., [5/5 stars on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0761152253/ref=s9_simp_gw_s1_p14_t1?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=1PXZYMSSQCCMMV1538B7&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846)).  The problem is that not many people are aware that the book exists, and marketing is not my strong suit.  The publisher is no help at all.

If I could just improve sales a bit, I might actually be able to repair my damaged finances, and rejuvenate my compromised creativity/ambition. 

The favor: Could you guys recommend this book to your friends who enjoy reading, and/or to those looking for last-minute gift advice?

The book is a collection of obscure-but-interesting non-fiction articles, some of them from [my site](http://damninteresting.com), and some exclusive to the book.  If you're worried about recommending unfamiliar material, you can see more of the same on [Damn Interesting](http://damninteresting.com), and there are a number of reviews on Amazon.

I had my court date this morning. I was lumped in with people there for possession of controlled substances, theft, and a few other District Court type crimes. The judge didn't seem to be in too good of a mood. 

I got called up after twenty or so people that the judge didn't seem to like and I was pretty afraid I'd caught him on a bad day. He told me I was charged with the sale of a controlled species and then turned to the District Attorney for the deal and the DA said, ""$250 fine and court costs."" The judge looked at me and I said, ""I was under the impression that the arresting officers were going to recommend minimum sentencing at a $100 fine."" 

At this point the judge looked at the citation and read it for a moment, looked back at me and said with confusion, ""It was a *mounted* deer head?"" I said yes and he started to laugh and said, ""I didn't even know that was illegal?!?!?"" At which point the whole story came out while he laughed and the whole rest of the court people (DA, secretary lady, bailiff, other people on the docket) started laughing. He looked to the DA to get a new deal and the DA said, ""$150 and court costs."" 

This is where it got funny. The judge actually gave the, ""Are you serious?"" look to the DA and the DA explained how one of the Fish and Wildlife agents had come from across the state to ""handle this matter."" The judge *really* laughed then. It was treated as a complete joke, the judge says I can get Charlie back, and I only have to pay court costs assuming I don't re-offend in the next two years. 

Thanks r/favors for the laughs and the advice. I won't see Charlie for a week or so while he comes from the other side of the state, but I'll be sure to host a nice homecoming party!",,False,,t5_2re6a,False,,,True,t3_lwjf0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/lwjf0/update_on_kentucky_deer_head_debacle/,

US Airways took a refund that I requested, then altered what I wrote, and submitted it in my name to the TSA. Essentially, identity theft. Naturally, they deny all of this happening and I'm not able to even get a straight answer as to why they did this to me, or if it's even being investigated internally. But ""as a courtesy"" they are telling me that I can transfer ownership of these nonrefundable tickets to anybody else. It's over a $500 value, return trips included. My identity loss is your gain. Please actually need it, as $500 is a lot to me and I'd hate to see it go to someone who just wants a free ride.

edit: I need to get this transferred over by the end of tomorrow (Friday) so please be serious.

edit 2: This might be tough to decide. I'll let this ride out overnight and pm someone tomorrow morning. I'll need to get your name before I can fax it in so you have to be around in the morning to reply to me.

I was pointed here.

Following a recent snow storm, my wife's car has started to shake any time it goes faster than 40mph. My desktop PC died, and I'm going to need to replace at least the motherboard and the power supply. I tried to use my wife's PC, which had been acting up, and it looks like that one needs to be repaired as well. Best case, I'm looking at several hundred dollars I need to come up with. Worst case, I don't even know.

When my computer is working, I produce rock and electronic music.

My first album was a gritty, heavy set of rock tracks. It had industrial songs like [Candy](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/track/candy), punk songs like [Give It Up](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/track/give-it-up), and more down-tempo stuff like [Break](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/track/break). It was my first attempt at singing, and it was hard for me to do.

[My second album](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/album/the-shivers) was better-produced, and I started to incorporate a lot of electronic sounds. It has moody dance tracks like [Close Your Eyes](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/track/close-your-eyes), up-tempo industrial/electronic tracks like [Supersonic](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/track/supersonic), and straight-up rock like [Girl's Got Altitude](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/track/girls-got-altitude) and [Going Down](http://ianmarquis.bandcamp.com/track/going-down).

I know a lot of you guys absolutely hate it when people post shit like this. I understand. Reddit isn't a begging space, and because of that I hesitate to even ask. But even a few bucks here and there would be a huge improvement on my situation...so I'm going to go for it.

UPDATE: I just got a call from my mechanic. My wife's car has ice build-up on the rims, but no actual damage. Once it gets warmer in a few days, it should melt away and the car will be fine.

Title pretty much says it all but here’s a little backstory.

Of all the people she could have chose to send this to, she chose me. That made me feel really special, so I want to give her the best response ever! She’s super shy and only recently started to come out of her shell. But she’s just an amazing and super special little girl with a sweet and loving heart.

Any and all help will be appreciated (story and/or photos). I plan to include as much as possible that will help make this project a smash!

I’m asking anyone anywhere to take Shadow on a mini adventure in their locality. Ideally, I’d like Shadow to take a trip around the world. 

This can be accomplished by any means at your disposal but it’d be really cool if you could actually print Shadow out and take a genuine photo at some landmark nearby but this isn’t required.  Feel free to use software to get the perfect shot of Shadow at your favorite place in the world if that’s what you’d prefer to do.  I’ll accept any help you’re willing to offer.  

Also, since I’m only half decent at creative writing, if anyone would like to take a stab at a crazy or silly story for how Shadow’s trip around the world went, I’ll make sure the photos match.

Thank you all so very much in advance!

**Edit 1:**  *Just to be clear, I'm planning on compiling everything into one large packet with a single story of a huge adventure around the world.*  

**Edit 2:**  *I’m now thinking of trying to get it all published into a fully bound hard-cover picture book.  I’m researching time frames on publishing but I suspect it’ll take a week to get delivered so I’m setting a tentative date of* **April 27th or thereabouts** *for pics to be submitted.*

**Edit 3:** *Also, try to include a first name with your photos since we will need to include you in the storyline.  It doesn’t have to be your real name, just something we can use.*

**Edit 4:** *Compiling them all this weekend.  I’ll be checking throughout the weekend so hopefully I’m able to get everyone.  If I miss yours I am sorry, but I just don’t want to miss the deadline to ship the completed book to my niece’s class.  Thank you all so very much for everything you did to make it all work!  You are amazing!*

You can PM me or just reply to the post, whatever works for you.  But I’m sure people would love to see what others are doing in their pics, so I encourage people to post via reply.

I was lost in the world of Titanic and I was happy. Then I stuck my front wheel between the bars of the front gate and stood on only the pedals. I held my hands up and shouted, ""I am the king of the WOOOOOORLD!""

Long story short. Those pedals spun around, I fell down, one of the spikes on my gate tore right through my neck and came out my chin(FUCK LUCKY). My friend Jonathan(real name withheld) told me to stop trying to get off the spike. He sawed it off and rushed me to the doctor. This was a great idea because the second my doctor pulled out the spike, I started bleeding out rapidly. If he hadn't passed and seen me at that moment and knew exactly what to do. I would've been found dead in my front yard that day.

I changed schools and he went off to college, I met up with him 2 years ago and had found out his sister had died. During the small talk I remembered some time after the whole incident he had went with his sister to America. They went to an A&amp;F store and had picked up two similar necklaces. They wore them to mark that they had finally left their home country(trust me, for them it was the greatest day of their lives).

His was missing. We were brining up past memories and I had asked about his necklace. Felt like shit when he said his sister had lost hers, he got pissed and they had a whole argument about it. He had tried looking for one but didn't find it before she died, so at the funeral he had place his in her coffin. His b-day is coming up and I had decided to hunt for the necklaces, so far no luck.

I can't replace a necklace like that, however I was hoping to hunt and finally find one that was close to it. I recently stumbled upon several pics of them and noticed they were in different colors. It really doesn't matter the color. I just need one of the necklaces.

**IF YOU HAVE ONE STORED SOMEWHERE OR YOU REMEMBER YOUR FRIEND HAD ONE PLEASE, I'M WILLING TO BUY IT OFF YOU/THEM. I JUST NEED ONE OF THEM. IF YOU HAVE IT IN RED THAT WOULD BE GREAT BUT THE COLORS DO NOT MATTER REALLY**

Edit: Why I want to find the necklace, even tho I cannot replace the memory. It's simple as this, his life has been a bit hard lately and after the funeral, they were pretty much out of money so local University was a must and that still sucked money. In this economy, him buying a ticket to fly out and chill or me buying for him is practically impossible.

I am obviously unable to grant any of these for her, but I would like to do something about the potion. I was thinking of concocting some drink with some sort of poem that says basically if you are meant to be a human that helps animals (she has wanted to be a vet since before prek) then you will remain a human but if you are meant to be an animal it will turn you into your favorite creature.

She has been wishing to become a horse for the past 2 years and is very disappointed that it hasn't happened yet. She is such a cool kid and with her sister having cancer, she doesn't get the attention and acknowledgment that she really deserves.

I am not asking for anyone to send anything or buy anything. I just need help with ideas on how to pull this off. If you happen to be good with writing little ditties/poems, I would LOVE to hear them! And if you know of a spot to get some cool potion (like) bottles, I would love that info too!

Many thanks in advance!

Edit: Holy crap, I was not expecting so many responses! This is kind of exciting. Depending on how complicated your requests are, it might take me a bit longer than my usual one-two day production time. Please be patient. I'll try my best to get them out to all of you who are requesting! I'm not asking for anything in return and I'll cover the shipping costs, but if you feel the urge to send me something in return feel free!

Edit2: Sorry if I haven't yet responded to your requests... I'll get there eventually. I'm going to make a mass run to the yarn store tomorrow and pick up colors and stuff for the people that I've already talked to. A lot of you have said you're willing to pay for shipping and stuff, so I'll set up a PayPal account if you feel the need to donate to the cause (but don't feel obligated... unless you're overseas, in which case I will gladly request that you help me out :) ). Please note that if you're asking for crazy designs (like pictures) they will most likely be hand stitched on top of the basic scarf body rather than knitted in. It's just easier that way instead of me struggling and failing to make a design that is passable for what you're asking for.




Here's the PayPal account that I set up.. Hopefully I did it correctly. Let me know if it's not working!

Edit3: OKAY. I've stopped taking requests *for the moment*, but will be back up and running after I get done with the first batch of scarves. If I don't contact you this time, I will be sure to send you a message when I'm ready to make yours. Don't lose hope; I'm going to do my best to get to everyone (eventually)!

1286128018.0,106,self.Favors,dm9nl,"[MOD] If you want a logo, read this.",kleinbl00,123,17,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/dm9nl/mod_if_you_want_a_logo_read_this/,"We'll add this to the FAQ later.  blindingstars observed that lots of people are asking for logos, but few people know *how* to ask for logos.  So he put together a handy-dandy list of questions you should have already asked yourself (and are ready to answer) before you commission the assistance of someone else to help you with this task.  

**Your Business and Target Audience**

* What is the exact business name as you would like it to appear?

* What do you do? What's your industry, and what is your customer base (target audience) like?

* What are 3 things you want to express to your target audience?

**The Logo**

* What type of logo are you looking for? Text-only, image and text, image only, etc.?

* Are there examples of logos that you really like? What about ones that you dislike?

* What colors would you like to be incorporated? What colors do you want to avoid? Should the number of colors be limited, or are you looking for more color-rich treatments such as gradients/fades?

* Great typefaces (fonts) can really make a logo shine, but not all are free; you need to purchase the rights to use some of them. If a design that is using a specialty typeface is the most appropriate and effective, would you be willing to invest in an (affordable) commercial typeface for your logo? If yes, what budget should we keep in mind?

*  Are there any specific elements you'd like included? (ex: any specific shapes or motifs)

*  If you would like an image used in your logo, would you like it to be more literal (Apple) or abstract (Nike)?

*  Any other preferences we should know about?

**The Files**

*Raster images (JPG, PNG, GIF, and others) are made out of pixels, or tiny dots. If you resize a raster image too dramatically, these pixels become distorted and the image doesn’t look too pretty. They are fine to use, but you'll often need to generate a new raster image for each necessary size if you want to keep the file size down and preserve the logo's integrity and quality. Vector images (AI, EPS, SVG, etc.), on the other hand, are mathematical paths; they can be sized up or down to your heart’s content without losing any quality. Vector files offer a lot of flexibility; however, these cannot be as easily displayed online, and specialty software is necessary to open the files. Usually, it is a good practice to acquire both a vector and raster format for your logo.*

* Are you able to open vector files? Check to see if you have programs like Adobe Illustrator, CorelDraw, or [Inkscape](http://inkscape.org/) (bonus: that one's free!).

*  If you have a specific use for the logo in mind, what size should the logo be? A general guesstimate is okay.

*  If you have a specific use for the logo in mind, what medium will it be? (online/screen or print)

As a gentle reminder, we generally limit subreddit logos to subreddits of 500 or more (although we aren't total hardasses about it).  The more boring requests for logos we get, the less likely we are to let the requests through.  So if you can wait a week or two for your logo, wait a week or two.  We try really hard to keep this place interesting and as fascinated as you are by your WOW clan, the rest of us likely aren't.

*Finally, remember that ""that which you do not understand"" RARELY shares much Venn space with ""that which takes little time.""  Keep in mind that asking someone to provide you a logo is asking them for hours or days of highly skilled labor.  Be appreciative and for god's sake, don't be afraid of offering payment.  Most of the people you're asking spent a lot of money and a lot of time getting as good as they are.*

*Thanks, your friendly neighborhood /r/favors mods*

My father passed away in 2009 from a sudden heart attack and it kinda turned our entire family's world upside down.  Before he died, my mom and dad used to go on vacation once a year to Fort Bragg/Mendocino and spend a week up there.  When me and my brothers were younger, we could come along as well but as we grew we stopped going because we had jobs and couldn't get time off.  

My mom has been pretty down lately and keeps hinting about how much she'd love to go back to the coast with the family.  I'd love to be able to do this for her, but unfortunately my brothers are both financially morons and I don't make enough to rent a house for 3-5 days without getting assistance.  If somebody that owns a house up there wouldn't mind letting us use their home, I would be forever grateful.  We're very respectful and respect other people's property.  None of us drink.  There would be about 8 people total, so the bigger the house the better the fit it'd be.  If somebody would be nice enough to let us stay in their vacation home, I'd be more than happy to pay for a cleaning company to come in and clean after we leave.  We're not dirty by any means, but I would assume that this would be a normal step taken after a person rents a vacation home.  I was looking to do this either around Thanksgiving or Christmas as those seem to be the only times where the whole family can get away.  

TL;DR - Want to treat my mother to a family trip to Fort Bragg/Mendocino, but can't afford a vacation home.  Will pay for a professional cleaner to clean if somebody is nice enough to let us stay in the vacation home for 3-5 days around Thanksgiving or Christmas.

I'm young, tall thin, passable, friendly, quiet, intelligent, cheerful disposition, a little shy.
I've been able to find resources to take care of my medical and food needs, and some help with job hunt advising.

**REQUEST FOR AMERICAN PARTICIPANTS IN ONLINE PSYCHOLOGICAL SURVEY:**

I am an undergraduate at the Churchill College, Cambridge, launching a survey for my final year psychology research, which requires as many US national participants (ideally students/18-30s/grads) to respond as soon as possible.

We were wondering if you would be interested in taking part in this research, and forwarding it to other American students/peers? They may be domiciled anywhere, but *I am particularly interested in hearing from those in the US* and would be really grateful to anyone who can encourage more Americans to take part! (It should ideally be forwarded to an indiscriminate sample of peers so that the data collected is generalisable).

Participation involves reading provided excerpts of text and responding to a short questionnaire. It is entirely anonymous and confidential, and should not take any longer than 10 minutes to participate. I hope that you will find participating in this experiment interesting!

Here is the link to the questionnaire:

[Czech it out.](http://www.blackmarketarts.com/scribbles/reddit#!/scribbles/reddit)

*(Someone cleverer than me who spent 18 months in Federal prison suggested to me that I suggest to Youngluck that he get good at drawing prison tats, because that would make him a rawk star and less likely to get into any drug- or gang-related drama while inside.  I hypothesize that this is related to that.  In other words, you'd be helping him out a bunch if you did this - and if you felt like [chipping in on art supplies](http://www.reddit.com/r/Youngluck/comments/dn718/canteen_info/) it wouldn't hurt.  No need to send massive amounts of money; if you do Paypal the fees are pretty minor.  A buck or two would be plenty.  If not, no big.  As Youngluck himself has said, there's plenty of people who need cash more than he does.*

So, three days ago the /r/favors mod mailbox recieved this from the account ""solidasarock:""

&gt;Somebody suggest i post to r/favors, I did but my post disappeared, Did I do something wrong?, I know i forgot to put [request] at the front.

Anomander, being the gentleman and scholar that he is, responded with:

&gt;Well. This is awkward.

&gt;While not ""wrong"" per se, the problem lies in the request. You'll note the sidebar where we state that ""/r/Favors will not manipulate votes for you."" This was something the community settled on just after it was founded, and we have held on to since.

&gt;Your request falls solidly within the purview of that rule.

There ya go.  That's the way we roll 'round here.  Your view behind the curtain.  Things should have ended there.

*But They Didn't*

Two days ago, the account ""thegoanna"" posted a tirade in /r/reddit.com about how Reddit is full of wonderful people, and things are great, but obviously all the ""newbies"" are dragging things down and doesn't it suck and ""my friend"" was just trying to win a car and evil ""wasps"" got up in her shit about vegetarianism or some such.  [This link](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/d3x0q/can_you_tell_me_what_i_need_to_do/) was included in [the post](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d3y4k/never_forget_redditors_the_links_we_post_make/).  Obviously, that link has been edited for reasons that are about to become obvious.

*   *    *   

*Ain't No Drama Like Reddit Drama*

Now - I'm a fan of Reddit.  And I didn't like seeing it being called a ""hive of wasps"" (or whatever) because people weren't particularly interested in helping a person win a car.  [I said as much.](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d3y4k/never_forget_redditors_the_links_we_post_make/c0xdxxl)  Things then went down the shitter with such stunning rapidity that I found it [worthy of note.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worstof/comments/d46sj/reddit_is_a_terrible_place_because_they_wont_give/)  This led to a great deal of drama, lots of namecalling, and the creation of /r/assistance which, with exactly one subscriber, [started pruning the deadwood.](http://i.imgur.com/M3kCV.png ""if by 'deadwood' you mean 'me.'"")

*   *   *   

*Down But Not Out*

Both thegoanna and solidasarock proceeded to delete their accounts in a cloud of indignation.  /r/assistance, however, has now set forth to be [""basically /r/favors.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/d54tt/redditors_helping_redditors_join_our_team_its_the/)  I've [got a guess](http://www.reddit.com/user/longislandlarry) as to where thegoanna and solidasarock went, but it's just a guess.  Apologies to anyone I have slighted who do not deserve to be.

*   *   *   

*No Skin Off Our Nose*

Obviously, ""people helping people"" is something we can all get behind.  And clearly - if you feel /r/assistance is a place you can help out more than /r/favors, you should add it to your frontpage.  However, I felt it necessary to provide the backstory of how, exactly, it came about...

...because I've seen too many good things happen in this subreddit to see it sapped for vindictive reasons.

As my name suggests, I'm ten levels of broke. Normally this fact doesn't bug me, but with Christmas nearing I was facing the reality of no gifts for my son. What little money I had from my pell grant return, I spent on clothes for him. Unfortunately, clothes don't make the greatest presents (or so I recall) and trying to sell him on his school clothes doubling as Christmas gifts seems to be in bad taste.

While talking/venting with one of my buddies about how stressed I was over the situation, he said that I could have his PSP that he never played. I was stoked and I know my son is going to be too. That is if he gets a game he likes with it. Right now I only have ATV, and while I think he'll enjoy it, I'd hate for his only present be ""meh"" because he didn't get a game he enjoyed.

Here's where you can hopefully help me. I need some really cheap, but fun games for an 8 year old boy. Where do I go? Any sites, or discount codes? What games should I look to get him? 

Preemptive thank you, redditors.

edit: Some redditors have made mention of the fact that some people may *want* to get rid of some of their old games, and I don't know what to say to that. That was not my intent. This thread answered none of my questions, but seems to be taking a beautiful turn towards an even better solution. If you absolutely feel compelled to gift them to my son, send me a PM. I'll give you his first initial, last name, and address and you can send them to him. I was initially against posting pictures of him opening these presents, but I'd be bound by my love of reddit to show the community how happy they've made a kid.

edit2: The psp is the 1000 series. Unfortunately, it has been updated to the new 6.2. I'm reading and seeing that I can't mod it without a Pandora Battery (whatever that is, will read) and I obviously don't have one. Am I understanding this right?

I think it would be cool to journal once a day for a month and then have someone from reddit to ship it to, who in return would ship me a journal they have been writing in once a day, for a month.

The entries being anything from a couple words, to two pages or a drawing, a picture, etc. Not necessarily doing it in a way that is intentionally made to send to someone else, but more so as if it was a journal kept for yourself. Maybe a thing or two would need a backstory, who knows. In the end though, it is really up to you how you write it and what you do with your journal during the month. And of course there's a possibility of one, two, or three days missed because stuff happens; we get sidetracked or busy.

It's rather simple, but to be able to reach inside the mind and thoughts of someone else that I've never met and who possibly lives far away is a cool thought to me. ANYWAY. If anyone is open and up for this, respond, PM me, or whatever. Just let me know!

**EDIT: I'm really excited that quite a few people have responded and seem interested! I wasn't sure how this would go over. A subreddit was suggested and I'm thinking that could be a good idea. If you have suggestions for a name, throw it out. Once the subreddit is made I'll post it in another edit.**

**EDIT 2: Thank you for the suggestions! There were some really good ones and it was actually pretty hard to have to make a decision.

However, this has its own deleterious effects, such as the [relinked Reddit vs. Digg infographic](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cu6h6/reddit_vs_digg/) was positively burying the [original Reddit vs. Digg infographic](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cu8ts/digg_vs_reddit_an_infographic/) until somebody reposted it to /r/pics and linked it in the comments.  There Is Clearly Something Wrong With This.

Part of the problem was the whole [RobInGallup/Saydrah dustup](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/b7yf2/by_request_dear_saydrah_love_rob_in_gallup/c0lesd5) basically illustrated the dangers of calling something ""blogspam"" when it isn't and how sensitive the issue is - and part of the problem is that ""blogspam"" is *really poorly defined right now.*

So based on discussion in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/cu6h6/reddit_vs_digg/c0vbaa8) I'm hypothesizing that if Reddit in general had a less nebulous understanding of what Blogspam *is* we might have better luck keeping it in check without simply offloading everything onto Imgur...

So I contributed this:

 -  Whether ""the average person, applying contemporary community standards"", would find that the link, taken as a whole, is more about drawing pageviews for monetization by the submitter than it is about providing the community with entertainment

 -  Whether the link contains, in a clearly demonstrable way, SEO tactics specifically proscribed by Reddit standards and practices

 - Whether the link, taken as a whole, lacks value beyond driving pageviews to the host

      I want to say thank you to the favors community for embracing this offer so much, and thank you to everyone who wrote in. As you may have noticed the 30 days is up. A few things happened, the first is alot of projects I was excited about came through. The second is that I learned alot about this community and design in general as a freelancer. I am currently still working on a project, and I will admit it's alot bigger than I initially anticipated and as warned did take up most of the time. I do not know for certain if I will continue to list after I finish. While many of you accepted my offer some had me do the work and then never looked at it, or responded when I emailed you letting you know I had finished it. This makes me a bit hesitant to continue, but if I continue the projects or do this again in the future I will definitely know how to manage it better. But above all I do want to state how grateful I am to everyone who helped.


The time has come for me to give a bit back to a community whom has given so much to me over the last few months. I am a Graphic Designer whom has worked for a large corporation part and full time since 2008. However I am finally planning to break free and go freelance full time in about 6 weeks. The advantage of this is that I've learned alot of the years, but the downside is that my personal portfolio has taken a beating because let's face it...when you do this 40 - 60 hours a week it's the last thing you want to do in your free time.

That being said I want to spend 30 days of the next 6 weeks giving back to reddit. For this reason I will be offering up my talents, for free, to anyone whom requests. I will take on three projects at a time, and once completed pick up three more. You can make requests as large or small as you would like, but keep in mind that the longer the project the less time others will be able to get.

So what's the catch? Just give me the okay to post the finished product on my portfolio. That's pretty much it. I specialize in print media advertisements and branding. Think business cards, posters, and flyers. I will post on here the three projects I am currently working on and when I am ready to take on more. Let me know if you have any questions!

**Quick Update since I've gotten a couple emails about this** I specialize in print media and branding, which does involve some web work but I am by no means a web developer / designer. I apologize that I am not the best person to help with website development type work.

**Another Update** I apologize if I am not responding immediately to your emails. I am still in the office and am doing these projects in my free time. I will respond to all questions when I am at home at 4pm PST

04:00 PST: As promised I am at my home office working away. Alright so here's the thing. This has gotten way more responses than I anticipated and I am very grateful! This is going to make for some strong work, and good additions to my portfolio. I am going to dedicate this weekend to getting as many projects done as possible. I have also done away with the three project minimum. I am going to compile a list of the requests I've gotten and post it on here so I everyone can know where they stand. Please know the top of the list can see work arrive in as little as 1 - 2 days, hell maybe even tonight. Some of you may be being pushed to the 30 day mark.

One other thing I wanted to add is that requests should be sent to BlackSkullDesigns@Gmail.com if you have a long explanation or additional details you want to add. This is also a faster way of getting ahold of me as I have now linked this email to my phone.

The last thing I want to say is thank you to all of you. I was timid about doing this thinking no one would respond and here I would have a site up and running with little over a dozen 3 - 4 year old projects posted. This community truly appreciates it's artists and as someone whom spent many years living off ramen you have no idea how much I appreciate seeing this kind of out pour.

Alright redditors were up to 10 projects. I will PM you when it's your turn. Until I finish these I will not be taking on any additional work. 

*I will keep updating the list with redditors whom send me requests via email. But please note I do not produce, and will not produce, second quality work. Understand if you are added towards the end of the list and I cannot reach it within 30 days I will not be able to complete the project. I hope this doesn't come across as mean but I like to be honest about these things.

UPDATE I am getting started on the projects and will mark them on the list as 'Done' once completed. I have officially locked myself away in the office! Also a very big welcome to the kind redditor whom gifted me with reddit gold. 

08AUG2011 - I had to stay in ill today folks. Regretfully not much progress was made. Check back tomorrow.

10AUG2011 - I am back up and running! The cold tried to kick my ass but it failed. More projects published tonight and more replies to emails.
Thank you to everyone for being patient.

21AUG2011 - I am still working through the projects! I've come to the conclusion that instead of trying to get all of these projects crammed into 30 consecutive days I will continue to work on them until I have worked for 30 total days. Look for more projects to be posted soon!

**WARNINGS** I am baking in my own home, which contains a cat, a dog, peanut butter, dairy products, wheat, etc.  If you are allergic to something and want cookies, I will try to oblige you, but no guarantees.  I don't want to accidentally kill anyone while trying to perform a simple act of kindness.

**Edit** I need to get some sleep.  I'll check in when I awake, and hopefully I'll have found a couple cookie recipients.

**Edit 2** Cookie recipients have been found.  As soon as I have their addresses, I'll take this post down.  Thanks for sharing everyone, more cookies will be up for grabs next week.

**Edit 3**  [Here](http://allrecipes.com//Recipe/oatmeal-chocolate-chip-cookies-i/Detail.aspx) is the recipe if anyone is interested.  I just subbed out 1 cup of chocolate chips for 1 cup dried cherries.

**Edit 4** OK, this time, really, all available cookies have been claimed.  But I've decided I can't take this post down - there are just too many deserving people who need cookies.  Stay tuned for a fresh batch as soon as I fly back from the grocery store.

We need help in many ways.,sundogdayze,103,24,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/dce3w/request_my_friends_son_was_hit_by_a_truck_we_need/,"My friend Melisa's son Christian was in a bad accident on Wednesday. He is 11, and he crossed the street at a blind curve on his way home and was hit by a pick up truck. There's no issue with the driver, it was a complete accident and he has been great. But we now have an 11 year old who is on limited insurance in the hospital.

He suffered a broken pelvis, broken legs, collapsed lungs, skull fractures, and hemorrhaging of the brain. He has been in a drug-induced coma since Wednesday, and has needed a ventilator to breathe.

His mother, Melisa, is having to take off work to stay with him, and to be honest, she was not rich to begin with. She has 2 other children, and Christian's insurance is not going to cover everything.

None of Melisa's friends have experience with brain injuries, and we are desperate for advice. Please see his [CaringBridge](http://www.caringbridge.org/visit/christianstubblefield). We are asking that anyone who has had experience with children's brain injury please give us information.

Also, because Melisa has had to take off work to be with her son, and because the insurance does not cover all expenses, if anyone wished to make donations, there has been a paypal setup in his name. The email is christian.stubblefield@gmail.com. 

If you want to make a donation to the family, I would be glad to return a favor. I can photoshop pictures, help with writing/editing, or give advice on animal training.

I personally made a post a few days ago about how my family is struggling financially, and I do not want anyone to think that this is some scam to make money for myself. Every penny or piece of advice that we are able to get is going directly towards Christian and his family. This happened Wednesday, and I am more concerned with the health of an injured child than my own financial boo-hoos. 

Thank you so much for reading. We appreciate any support, advice, personal experience, or donations. Thank you, Reddit.

**Edit: Here is a picture of Christian in the hospital. It could be considered graphic, as it is a child who has been injured badly. [Christian in the hospital.](http://i.imgur.com/HY2oy.jpg).

**Edit 2: Thank you so much to those who donated, and to every single person who commented or has advice and support. I'm relaying everything to Melisa, and she is very grateful. You rock, Reddit.**

**The CaringBridge website's donation does not go to Christian, it goes to CaringBridge.org. You are, of course, welcome to donate to that organization as well, but I didn't want anyone to think it would make it to Christian.**

I called the older Latino guy to let him know I wouldn't be able to restore the bike, and he went and got the frame for me this morning, just out of the kindness of his heart. He's bringing it to Santa Cruz this weekend.**

Faith in humanity: restored. Thanks so much to those who offered to help, and especially to Nurga who [offered to ship me a frame](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/jriet/request_longshot_can_anyone_in_san_jose_ca_help/c2ek794) from 2,000 miles away, free of charge.

x-post from /r/bayarea, I know not every redditor is from the Bay Area, but there are probably a lot of you in Silicon Valley who don't subscribe to /r/bayarea, so that's why I cross-posted it.

**tl;dr: After spending the week finding the perfect bike frame for my new project bike, going from Santa Cruz to Oakland to get it, and then physically carrying it on AC Transit, BART, VTA 180X, and VTA Light Rail over two connections, for &gt;60miles, I had to leave it in San Jose. The operator of the very last HWY17 Express, which would take me for the final 30 miles of my 90 mile trip, screamed at me for trying to bring it on the bus, and forced me to abandon it at Diridon Station at 10:45PM. Can anybody in San Jose get it, or lock it to something, so that I can get it back?**

I can't afford a car, and I've got an old touring bike that I use for transportation, but riding it 15 miles each day starts to wear on it, and it needs a lot of maintenance. I also use it for camping and groceries, but I don't need a touring bike to get to work, which is less than a mile away.

So, since I just graduated college and need some sort of hobby to fill my time, I decided to build my first bike. I spent weeks on the Santa Cruz craigslist looking for a frame that was within my budget, but the town is just too small, and there aren't enough bikes laying around for an available one to fit my needs.

This weekend, I returned to my hometown, San Francisco, for a graduation party. I got a little cash from relatives, and lo and behold, the one day I'm in the Bay Area, I find a frame that fits me, that is well within my budget, and in the style I was looking for. I cancelled my plans for the day, and rode BART (through the riot police) out to Oakland to get the bike.

The seller was a 30-something African American dude, whose name I forget, because it was one of those names you guys like to make fun of so much. I was a little nervous about going to Oakland at night for this perfect bike frame, but it turns out this guy lives in a really nice neighborhood, so I went to meet him. He rolled up in a lexus and stepped out wearing a tasteful suit. He shook my hand firmly and told me about how he needs the frame out of his back yard. He wanted to fix it up, but realized he didn't have the time to pull it off.

I gave him my email address and told him I'd send him an imgur album with the full restoration, step-by-step, starting with [this image.](http://i.imgur.com/ljtY4.jpg)

I took the bike on the AC Transit bus, and the bus driver asked if my bike had been robbed of its wheels. I laughed, and told him I'd just bought the frame, and I was going to fix it.

I took it on BART, and an African American teenager with a track bike asked me what I was planning on doing with it.

On the VTA bus from Fremont to San Jose, an older Latino guy perked up when he saw the frame. He went, ""Is that a Schwinn?"" and then told me all about how, for decades, he made extra money by going around San Jose with his pickup truck and getting bikes out of the trash for restoration. He runs a locksmith business, and apparently he had his son ask all their customers, after closing the deal, if they had any bikes laying around in their back yard that they wanted to get rid of. He said he focused mainly on old Schwinns, and he named his son something like ""Shaun,"" but his and his son's love for Scwinn road bikes led to his son's nickname being ""Shau-winn.""

Apparently, he was riding the bus because his girlfriend was the driver, and he liked to keep her company. They informed me that the 180X, unlike the 181X, didn't go to Diridon station, but only to the Great Mall. His girlfriend gave me a VTA Day Pass for free, so that I didn't have to pay for the light rail. She also gave me her boyfriend's phone number so I could call him for any Schwinn parts I needed for the project.

**EDIT: Giving me his phone number wound up getting me the bike back. YAY!**

This whole confusion led me to missing the 2nd-to-last Highway 17 bus to Santa Cruz, and so I waited for 45 minutes for the last one of the night to depart.

Finally, 3 hours after I'd left the house in Oakland, the bus arrived, and when I boarded with the frame slung over my shoulder, the driver said, ""I can't let you take that on the bus. It's got sharp edges.""

(This is from memory, but the nature of it is correct.)

I said, ""Well, where can I put it?""

He goes: ""Not in here.""

Me: ""But this is the _last bus._""

Him: ""I know. Lock it up and drive back for it.""

Me: ""I don't have a lock, I don't have anywhere to stay in San Jose.""

Him: ""Well, too bad.""

Me: ""There are like 6 other people on here, can't I just put it back there?""

Him: ""I'M NOT ARGUING ABOUT THIS.""

After that, he became irate. I tried to plead my case a little longer, but he told me he wasn't going to let me on the bus at all. Several other passengers asked him to let the frame on the bus, but he yelled the same thing at them.

Eventually, I had to leave the frame leaning against the fence at Diridon Station, to catch the last bus home. It's probably still sitting there as we speak.

**Where you come in**

I know the frame was old and needs a repaint, but god damnit, _it was mine._ I had plans for that frame. If you're in San Jose tomorrow and headed for Santa Cruz, is there any way you can get my frame for me?

Even easier, if anyone is going to Diridon Station tomorrow (Tuesday), can you bring a combination lock with you and lock my frame to a rack so I can get it back somehow?

yet again I'm offering you the music that didn't make it on one of my releases or I didn't license to anybody. You can use it for your youtube videos, movies, games, porn, website or ads. Just please don't use it for anything promoting hate or violence against minorities.   

Individual stems can also be requested for most songs.

*If* you would like to use my music just shoot me a PM, post a comment or anything and I will provide you with a link to a HQ-Upload. 

Credit would be a nice gesture but I don't demand it.

I've been doing this for a while.. it inspires me to keep writing and keep being creative. I have an hour of upload left on my free soundcloud account and I'm hoping to fill it up with comments from this post.

So post some ideas and I'll get started.

Here are some of the other songs I have made from other posts.

Edit: You guys are crazy in a good way. I'm still working on your ideas but I won't be uploading them tonight because there is too much noise interference. Come back and check the post occasionally even if I've written you a song. There's guaranteed to be some interesting songs based on some of these ideas and I need the soundcloud views like redditors need their karma. I will get to your idea I promise it just might take a week or so.

Edit #2: Filled up my hour of soundcloud upload time (primary goal achieved) now trying to obtain funds to get a premium account to continue. Also I have weapons grade flu and severely underestimate the dark side of my exam study which is a lot more than I thought I had to do. So my focus is that till the 8th then I'll see how many more requests I can knock off. 

I assume most people have left so if you read this and send me an reddit-mail it means you still frequent the page and are waiting patiently for your song to be made. I will endeavor to make yours a priority but I'm still planning to write them all so I'll keep you posted.

ORIGINAL POST 11/4

I am an English teacher in a Korean elementary school. I started [postcrossing](http://www.postcrossing.com) recently and I love it! 

I was able to get a small budget from my school and after a rough start (had to go all the way to Seoul to get postcards and raided multiple local post offices of their stamps), I've started my 5th and 6th graders on postcrossing as well and they've just received their first postcards from around the world.

**The thing is the other grades (3rd and 4th) found out and they're sad that they aren't getting postcards as well!** =(

***

**So my request is this:** send me a postcard that I can give to my 3rd and 4th grade students. 

*The World and Geography* is slotted for the first two weeks of December and if I could get enough postcards for each student (40 students total) it would be amazing. I'm hoping to integrate it into the lesson.

Postcards clearly displaying the name of your country or city is fantastic. Landscapes, landmarks, night lights, native animals, plants, the national flag etc are greatly welcomed.

Anything else that you think the kids would like that has some tie or relationship to your country and/or culture is really appreciated. 

(They're also fans of baseball, soccer, computer games and cute animals =)

Students learn the alphabet in public school in third grade here but most have been in English academies for a while. I have a range of English levels here so if you just say hello that's fine. Feel free to introduce yourself simply. 


For example,

 
* Hi, my name is ____.

* I like ____.

* My favorite ___.

or a little something about your family, your pets, your country, the weather, favorite food, your hobbies, the postcard, etc. The simpler the better. 

Also **print clearly** as they cannot read cursive.



PM me and I will give you the school address,(different time zone from most of you and about to go to bed so expect the address in a few hours) 

and feel free to send multiples if you feel so inclined :)

Thanks in advance everyone! I will now attempt to bribe you with [pictures of some of my students.](http://splentastic.imgur.com/little_mites)

I'm an 18 year old in Seattle desperately looking for a job. I'm hoping some Redditor will be able to help out a fellow Redditor and gain a hard working employee in the process.

A bit about me:

I am about to complete my second year of college and receive my associates degree. I went to college two years early with the Running Start program and am so glad I did. I love computers (building, maintenance, repair, etc) and just generally enjoy people. Most people see me as a very positive guy.

Work experience:

I worked summers full time (40 hr. weeks) with Wright Runstad and Co from when I was 14 to 16. I did everything from cleaning air ducts to picking up cigarette butts to simple mechanical repairs and maintenance in buildings in downtown Seattle and Redmond City Hall (for one summer.)

The summer of my 17th year (and on into the school year) I was employed by Goodman Real Estate. I was lucky enough to net a position on the IT team and I spent the next eight months repairing computers, responding to help desk requests, and doing anything that the real estate firm of 30 needed. I loved this job. Unfortunately, the IT budget got cut by more than 60% last month and my position was one of the casualties.

I'm willing to do anything, sweep floors, pick up trash, wash dishes. I desperately need to pay for college in the upcoming years. I even took night classes so I could work more, but alas, the layoff was unforeseen. 

Please someone send an application my way! I've been pounding the pavement for about a month now.

It was a version of Between the Wars (originally by Billy Bragg I believe) but sang on a 1998 radio show live appearance (I think from what I can gather) by Daniel Grieves from The Watchmen.

I cannot find this anywhere and want to use the song in his wedding in some fashion (maybe a thinking of you from those who cant be there etc..).

I admit I am not a super computer dude that can research this type of thing nor do I know how to get songs for free or by anything other then iTunes (as I always just pay since I am too dumb to get any other way).

",synesthesiatic,93,20,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/f5144/request_please_respect_graphic_designers_if_youre/,"This is a PSA / request for everyone.

Art of any kind gets treated often like it's not a skilled trade. This stuff is hard. Not everyone can do it, and unfortunately, the art world is fiercely competitive, and very difficult to make a living in. 

The time and effort it takes to design something is not generally cost effective. As an example, I'll spend fifteen hours on an image someone will pay 25 dollars for, when all is said and done. 

Professional graphic designers are pretty busy people. [I live with one, I hardly see him.] It's often downright inconvenient to have to design something for someone ON TOP of regular workload. It's why I don't often do art for free, there simply isn't time.

So when you ask for a logo or for art, please do keep in mind that this stuff is can be quite time consuming, and most of us art kids are insane perfectionists that want to hand you something nice or legitimately awesome.

We do want to help. Just be civil, and keep in mind that art isn't magic, it's work, just like everything else. [Albeit work we really love.]

My son has Autism and goes to a specialized school for treatment (OT, speech, behavioral, etc.)...they use an iPad in his learning regimen, and he has responded tremendously to it (his hand-eye coordination has gone through the roof!).  We bought a used iTouch, but it's just a bit too small for him (he did learn to play Angry Birds on it, which is kinda crazy).  I would love to trade or buy (within reason) a used iPad or maybe a few broken ones that could be combined (I have tech experience).  

Here are some things that I have to trade:

A few [Baldor Grinders](http://i.imgur.com/fOFI7.jpg)

A [Foredom Flex-Shaft Hang-Up Motor with foot pedal](http://www.foredom.net/sr-fct.aspx) (like a dremel tool, but a bit better)

Fallout Shelter Signs - original Fallout Posters from US Civil Defense (some super-rare): [First Example](http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/artgal/trumanlib/thumbs/1952Fcda003.jpg) - [Second Example](http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/artgal/trumanlib/thumbs/1952Fcda004.jpg) - [Third Example](http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/artgal/trumanlib/thumbs/1952Fcda008.jpg) - [Fourth Example](http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/artgal/tnbusfamfout.jpg) - These are the actual posters that I photographed and sent to the Civil Defense Museum, for their website. I have a ton of Steel Signs as well, many of them are pretty rare (I was a pretty big collector of Cold War Memorabilia, before my son was born).

Pm me, send me your
name, 
birthdate,
address, and
a bit of personal info, if you want a more personalized card. (optional)
 
Thanks, hope you guys have fun too.  I'll edit once I reach 20 peeps.

EDIT: Forgot to add birth date.. also, i've got around 6-7 spots left

ALL THE SLOTS FOR THIS ROUND HAVE BEEN FILLED. 

THanks for all the interest. Currently I have 108 people involved which will cover 4 cameras. I will post an new updated post with more details in the next week. IF you have volunteered for this then please check the new post to make sure your name is on there CORRECTLY (this is very important) and that you still wish to participate. Also remember that it will take time for it to possibly travel from place to place so please be patient. 

Thanks again for all the interest. I can't wait to see the results.




Yesterday, there was a post about a [camera that captured its trip across the US.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/i7pf8/disposable_camera_captures_its_own_trip_across/) 


Out of that, a new reddit [r/cameramail](http://www.reddit.com/r/cameramail/) was made.

I took that idea, and tweaked it. My idea is to send a camera around the world using reddit users around the globe. I would start it off by taking a picture, then I would send the camera to another reddit user who lives in a different state or country. They would take a picture and then send it to another reddit user somewhere else. The goal is for it to travel around the world to every continent (except Antarctica for obvious reasons) and the last person would send it back to me. I think disposable cameras have about 24 pictures, so hopefully it could make it to 24 different places. I will then develop the pictures and post them online for everyone to see.

I was thinking I will include some paper so the person can put their location and email address down so we can map out everywhere the camera has been on its journey. Maybe people taking the picture can hold up a sign with the City and Date.  Hopefully the people involved will take a unique pic or something other then their balls or living room and we will get some cool results.

I am just asking for people who might be interested in participating in this project. You would have to pay to ship the camera to the next person. I haven't got the details organized yet, but I thought the first step would be to see if there was enough interest to try it.


EDIT:

Wow! I'm glad so many people wanna be a part of this. Keep putting your name down and I will send out more then 1 camera. I am going to buy a Reddit Alien USB out of the Reddit store to send with one of the cameras so we have something to put in the picture. I only have enough money to buy 1, but maybe someone who is taking part would be willing to buy one, or someone has an idea for something else. I will order it tonight and send out the camera when it arrives. If anyone has a suggestion for what to include with the other camera please let me know.

Also if there is anyone out there from Asia, South America, and Africa, please join in. I would like to have the cameras travel to every major continent and as many countries as possible if we can work it out.

Thanks again for the interest and if you still want in, put your name and location down and I will try to put together a plan for the camera route.



EDIT 2:

Ok everyone. I am going to send out as many disposable cameras as it takes to try to involve everybody who wants in on this. It is going to take me a few days to get everyone's information sorted out and try to put together groups. I will post an update later on this week with more information and hopefully have a few groups made up so everyone can check and make sure they are on one of the list.

Thanks again for participating in this. Hopefully this will turn out to be a success.


EDIT 3:

Right now, I have 107 people from 27 different countries who want to take part in this. It is going to a week or two to kick this off because I have to order the reddit alien flash drive. This will let everyone take some pictures on their own digital camera and put them on the flash drive, as well as giving everyone a reddit alien to put in their pictures. I will make a new UPDATE post before I send anything out that will have some guidelines to follow and the groups when I get everything ready to go. Thanks again for making this idea happen.

Mail them to me please.,poopshoes,80,15,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/dbysy/request_got_some_kid_books_rotting_in_an_attic/,"Hi. I feel odd asking for a favor from the reddit community, but I'm desperate so here goes:

I am an elementary school librarian. I want -- I *need* -- your old childhood books. Shabby condition is fine; as long as pages aren't falling out all over the place, I have kids who will read them.

Here's a bit about the students I serve and why I am resorting to begging for your charity:

~650 children, 5- to 11-years-old. 85-90% of them come from homes falling below the state and federal poverty line, and a similar percentage come from predominantly Spanish-speaking households. Reluctant readers en masse -- and I don't have much to offer the several avid readers, either. I have no budget for purchasing new books, and my own resources limit me to the odd bargain bin pickups each month. Our school is also just 10 years old, and the library was only opened to students a little under two years ago. So, while the student body has grown exponentially, the library grows ... well, extremely slowly. It is dominated by books that are very low-interest for these kids.

Based off of what I hear kids asking for on a daily basis, these are the following sorts of books I would kill for:

- Choose Your Own Adventure

- Encyclopedia Brown, Hardy Boys, or other young adult mystery novels (we have a ton of Nancy Drew, though!)

- Where's Waldo?

- Origami, magic tricks, how-to-play-an-instrument books or any other interactive craft- or skill-based instructional book.

- Books on Michael Jackson or the Beatles. For real.

- Anything by Roald Dahl 'cause I've made damn sure these kids love him

- Any Mike Lupica or other sports-related 'boy' novels, especially about soccer.

All I can really offer in return for your generosity is a thank you letter from the kid(s) who have been asking for these books. For Choose Your Own Adventure donations, I will probably feel obligated to send along thank you drawings as well.

Please, if you have books that are going unread that you wouldn't mind sending away to an address within the lower 48 states, send me a PM. You'd be making a ridiculous number of kids happy.

And certainly, if you don't have books, please offer an upvote so more people might see this. :)

This is not a solicitation, or spam. I'm honestly just looking for a small, quick favor from anyone who enjoys drawing. If there is something I can do for you, please don't hesitate to ask.

Let me explain. I am just about finished with my Wedding's 'Out of Town Welcome Letter' but I was hoping to add a drawing of my dog. I completed the letter using photoshop, clipart and South Park avatars of me and my fiancée', but I couldn't find a suitable drawing that looks close enough to our dog. And of course I have absolutely no drawing skills, so I am stuck. If you all say no, and downvote me, it is not the end of the world but obviously I would be forever grateful to anyone who can lend a hand!

Below is a what I believe to be a cute picture of our dog Fibi (4 year old Cavachon) http://i.imgur.com/niEhW.jpg

If you are interested, and have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. I am also not sure if this is the correct subreddit so if I am off then I apologize.

Thanks!

EDIT: I just want to say thank you to everyone who took the time! I am going to put together a Fibi collage of all your wonderful drawings!! You have given me the cherry on top of my wedding cake!!!

EDIT2: I just wanted to show you guys the end result.  Leroy_Wiggles really bought the South Park theme home for me.  But everyone submission was amazing.  I also want to thank Kcwilcox - http://i.imgur.com/QUF59.jpg (for the most amazing pastel version of Fibi ever!). But who also offered to frame and ship it to me which is just unbelievable.  I can't thank everyone enough.  You have certainly made my day!

Are you depressed and feel like something handmade with love would cheer you up? Are your children sucking you dry and you have no moneys for cozy winter headwear? 

I can help! 

I have several soft, warm hats that I've made just sitting around, and I have the materials and time to make more. 

You will be getting a hat like one of these: 

http://www.flickr.com/photos/liztrim/sets/72157627862051872/

(Try to ignore my derp faces)

In whatever colors you like. Your hat may be made with bulky yarn like in the photos, or it may be made with lighter-weight worsted yarn, depending on what I have (given the choice, I will usually choose bulky because I can turn out hats at a higher rate). All yarn I use will be comfortable and of good quality. Nobody likes an itchy hat! 


Here is one I just finished for a Reddit user (this is using worsted weight yarn as opposed to bulky): http://imgur.com/xQTC8


My first happy recipient!
http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/ldkk4/why_i_love_reddit_thanks_to_thesavorytrim/


I will basically be doing hats in the order that best suits me and the supplies I have. I typically buy yarn every two weeks, and I have to be within my budget. So for people requesting colors I already have, they luck out and get hats sooner than those requesting funky colors. I will get to everyone, but some people necessitate a trip to the yarn store.


For people requesting strange patterns/beard hats/things other than basic beanies - I will be happy to attempt your requests, but they will have to be relegated to being side projects in between simpler orders. Unless, of course, you offer to pay me a chunk of money, in which case I will bump you up since that money funds the yarn for other hats! 


//EDIT AGAIN// - I am closing up the queue for now. I will reopen when I am finished with the orders I already have. I am overjoyed by the positive response!

I hate to do this again, but my wife's birthday is quickly approaching, and since it's her 40th, I know this would make me a hero if I could get her in to see a live taping of the show.

The problem is that you can't normally get tickets to watch the show, they use extras/actors to fill the audience, but I do know that they occasionally will make an exception.

Does anybody know anybody that work for the show that might be able to pull some strings to help us out?

They don't have to be store bought...I just want to put a smile on her face. My mom has a twisted sense of humor like myself so don't be afraid to be funny and creative. Make your own, buy it, it doesn't really matter...I just want to take my mom's mind off of all of the craziness that she's going to be dealing with. My mom is the most amazing person that I know and she's always been my best friend and I can't imagine what she's going through right now. It's hard losing my father, but what my mom is going through is so much more hardcore. She does so much for other people and I just wanted to do something to make the coming weeks a little easier for her. If you could take the time to send a smile her way I know she would appreciate it.

EDIT: My mom also collects postcards that have been mailed already! If you have any that you don't need, throw them in an envelope and send them to her...she'd still be touched that you are thinking of her!
Thanks so much!

I teach High School World Geography and US History, and I'm always coming up with new ways to make learning fun! (I know, it sounds impossible, but hear me out). To put it one way, I identify with my more tactile learners and love finding ways to get kids engaged that can't focus on reading/writing all the time. To put it another way, a bunch of my students (and possibly me) are ADD as FUCK and/or addicted to their phones and need super stimulating, fun stuff to hold their engagement.

 Last year we used a lot of play-doh and crafting stuff, but THIS year, I'm thinking Legos. We could do presentations, review activities, all SORTS of cool stuff with legos (of course, some reading and writing will be included in order to have access to lego projects).

The benefits of legos in my classroom will be three-fold: 1. ADD/technology distracted students will be fully engaged and excited about class 2. Novelty always increases engagement. 3. Legos are reusable. Last year I spent over $1,000 of my own money setting up markers, posters, and crafting supplies for projects. 4. FUCKING LEGOS!!1

I'm crowd sourcing tubs of legos right now, and facebook has been no help. Reddit, if you have any legos in your parents attic that you don't want anymore, PLEASE send them to me. PM me for my address, and upvote the hell out of this. My students are great kids who deserve some fun time during projects, and my pocketbook deserves a major-league break this year.

Another possibility, if you want to be proactive, is to check out [this article](http://www.csmonitor.com/Money/2009/1223/Arrow-Trucking-Drivers-band-together-to-help-those-dumped-by-Arrow). These organizations are offering to help stranded truckers:

I'm betting that if you call them, they could guide you towards a way you could help out.

This isn't some random guy on the internet. These are real people stranded, away from home and family, on Christmas. Please, if you are able, take a look and see if you can help. These are the people who keep our larders stocked and our businesses open. The trucking industry is in tatters right now, and no one deserves to be kicked this hard while they're down.

The quality of her drawings aren't going to be as high as the example I showed above as she spends a good few hours at a time on pictures such as that, the pics above take her ~30 mins or so.

She told me to say ""If they want higher quality pics, tell them to send me an email and I'll take more time"". But, whilst I think that's really sweet of her, I hardly think it's fair for her to take hours out of her time. Her decision though I suppose.

Any help at all would be great. I've been searching all over to find a replacement, and the internet has helped me find really obscure things in the past. Thanks in advance. 

Edit: Just realized the title should say request, but I don't know how to edit it. My apologies. 

2nd Edit: Thanks so much for the help, guys. I'm looking through the links posted and doing some more hunting on my own, hoping I can find a similar bear (I suspect we won't be able to find an exact replacement.) I'm going to check with my mom to see what she thinks, and see if she can remember what song it played. I really, really appreciate the help.

3rd Edit: sergi0wned found a nearly identical version of the bear, and I bought it on Ebay. I'm planning on giving it my sister the next time I see her (may be a few weeks, she lives in another town), and I'll post the results! Thank all of you so much for your time and help.

I am starting a reddit scholarship fund. Before actually opening up for donations I want to establish a procedure and system for everything. This is something I can not do alone so I am asking for volunteers who wish to work with me to develop this and help see it to fruition.


So here are some thoughts:

It must be completely transparent to eliminate/minimize the risk of fraud.

Criteria must be established for who is eligible to apply

Criteria must be established for who is awarded

Paypal will likely be used, but some simple scripting would need to be generated to track donation, etc

I originally conceived this to help fellow redditors, but I also think this would be a great way to give back to the outside world. The scholarship fund could be used to immediately grant donations from reddit to those we read about in the news who fall into unfortunate circumstances and are worthy of a helping hand.

I will transfer some of that old film you have laying around. I usually transfer old home movies. You should see the faces of some people light up when they see those old images again. I like doing it and I feel like I would like to do a random act of kindness for someone who may not be able to afford to transfer there old film. So hit me up. I do film and video transfer as a business here in Portland Oregon. I've been doing it for about 10 years now. If you do something nice for someone else and tell me about it, I will transfer some of that old film you have laying around.  

EDIT: I will transfer it to DVD or mp4 if you want to edit it yourself!

EDIT: So generally I charge .15 per foot for the transfer process. I'm offering this for free because i want to do something nice for someone else who could not do it on their own.
The process i use is pretty awesome in terms of results. I do telecine, so what that means is that I have specialized equipment that scans each frame of film and creates a raw uncompressed .avi file from the image sequence. from there its converted to whatever format my clients care for. I am a video editor at my day job but picked this up and built a business around film and video transfers. The equipment is specialized and expensive but it has paid for its self many times over.

EDIT: I will only be taking 2 more requests!

Thanks to all who have responded.  I am full for now.

The database currently has ~6,000,000 rows and is 180mb. This isn't the issue though, the data gathering is. Every 1 hour it has to collect the data of over 4,000 users and this takes ~40 minutes *and* 800% of my allocated CPU (meaning it lags my server). I could drop the data collection down, but I'd rather avoid that but I'll do it if I can't find anyone, or I'll just shut down the site as very few use it (~4k uniques a month). 

Ideally I'd continue to run it, but I can't afford it and I don't want to put up adverts or solicit donations as it's used by only a few people, so I'm hoping *maybe* someone who has spare server room or likes it would be willing to take over operating it for me. I'd hand over everything, data, domain etc etc and you'd take full control. The site stores a users combined karma, comment karma, link karma, comment rank (relative to users), link rank (relative also) and their combined rank at each 1 hour the site is updated. I originally intended to allow for daily breakdowns of a user karma and the data is there (which is why I still collect hourly) *but* I didn't get around to it. The site is PHP and mySQL, source is probably bad and can be optimized if whoever took it wanted to do that. 

It's a long shot, but is anyone interested taking in this off my hands? I can help set it up on a new server, hell I'll even administrate it for you and watch everything run smoothly if you wanted, I just can't afford to host it right now. I would also not object to someone interested in the idea but wants to build it their way doing that and just taking the domain or something.

For a video project of mine, I'd like to get help from fellow redditors willing to film themselves for a few seconds saying a word I'd send them. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit.

--

In short, I'd like to remake [that old video of mine](http://vimeo.com/3044183), but with many different people rather than many different instances of me. Skip to 00:44 to understand my goal.

The idea is simple:

* redditor agrees.
* I send her/him one word (or more if willing).
* he/she writes/prints it down on paper, and films her/himself saying the word (as best as they can -- French words!) and holding the paper with the word clearly visible.
* redditor sends me the video (should not take long to make, and not be longer than 5 seconds at worst).
* I edit them all together, and make a follow-up post about it all.

You can hide your face behind the paper, the important part is having many different people, accents, places, lights, voices... into one video.

The project is purely for fun, the words will not be insulting or tarnish anyone's reputation, I don't gain anything from it except smiles from my friends.

For more information, please PM me!

Thank you!

*Pour les français qui me connaissent : merci de ne pas griller la surprise ! :)*

--

**EDIT 1**, with numbers and dates!

* The original video contains 365 words (one for each day of the year). Depending on the response, I'll make a shorter text, use some people more than one time... :)
* I'd like to put the result online by January 31st. So ideally receive all participations by Friday 27th, so that I can edit it all during the week-end.

**EDIT 2**

Thank you gals &amp; guys for the amazing response! So far **~~82~~ ~~84~~ 91 redditors** have agreed to film themselves saying a word or two. This is great, keep'em coming! I'll put the finishing touch to my text soon, then send out PMs to all of you. Thanks a lot for participating, and do not hesitate to have more people signed up!

**EDIT 3**

**~~92~~ 93 redditors!** I'm going to let Reddit go into SOPA mode for a day, and once it's back up you should receive your word(s). Thanks a lot in advance for your participation! But keep telling your friends: it'd be cool to have over a hundred redditors! :)

**EDIT 4**

**98 redditors** as of latest count! I'm sorry if you're waiting for me to send the words out, I've been blocked and had no spare time. I'll try to start sending them today (Friday), so that you can record your videos during the week-end. Thank you everybody!

**EDIT 5** on 2012-01-21

Everyone should have received at least a couple words by now. There is some overlap with words: nearly each participant share her/his words with a couple others, so as to:

* take the better rendition (audibility, funniness, variety of accent)
* have an insurance against redditors who would forget about the project and not do their words :)

I'm already receiving videos. Hope to receive all yours soon! Thank you!

**EDIT 6** on 2012-01-30

After a few days of receiving only a dozen of words, I sent a reminder to everyone via PM, and was rewarded with a flood of contributions, many providing both their main words and their two bonus words, giving me the opportunity to choose the best renditions. Thanks!

I started making the final list last Saturday, and found out I was still missing some crucial words. I thus sent a request to those who told me they were available to do more words if need be. While I wait for their words, and started editing the final video on Sunday evening, and had a lot of fun thanks to the many contributions.

If you haven't done your words yet and still want to be part of the project, you have until Tuesday to send them! I'll make the final edit Tuesday evening (GMT+1), and publish around midnite (GMT+1 still). If there are any missing words by then, I'll do them myself.

I'll probably post the final video in one last edit of this post, AND create a new post about it all (because hey, [karma](http://i.imgur.com/3KQIt.gif)! :) ).

Thanks to all participants thus far!

**EDIT 7** on 2012-02-01

[IT'S ONLINE](http://xavier.borderie.net/blog/2012/01/31/en-2012-recyclez-vos-anciens-voeux/)! Actually it went online yesterday a couple minutes before midnight, but I had to e-mail it to friends before redditing it. Today I'll take the time to post a full-blown Reddit post about it :)

This is a dream and passion of mine. I am so very tired with the 9-5 routine and I want to show off my film ideas to the world. The past few years have been very trying on me and I decided to really make an effort this year to go after a life goal of mine. 

I have set up a donation page for my film company I am trying to get off the ground by making a short film. To me this is a lot of money but I feel I need to do this in my life. I want to bring my contributions to the independent film scene to life. I'm here to ask your support in any way you can give it to me. Donations will help my film get made but your support in other ways would be immense. If you choose to donate, I appreciate it more than you will ever know. This is, after all, my dream and you have always been kind and helpful.

Any donation from redditors will automatically go in my film credits with a special thanks.  If you dont want to be listed, thats also no problem.

1347511185.0,56,self.Favors,zt2tx,"[Offer] I have a T Mobile phone, and now work for Sprint. I'll save you some money, if you save me some money. I'll even throw in a meal, Denver Area. ",tejmin,68,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/zt2tx/offer_i_have_a_t_mobile_phone_and_now_work_for/,"So, I recently got a job with Sprint. They offer a nice employee discount.  Just before summer, I bought a Galaxy S II with T-Mobile on a 2 year contract. I've paid the deposit, and have been paying the bill on that phone. The way 2 year contracts work, is that if you don't finish the contract, you get to pay a nice Early Termination Fee, and pay for the device as well. $500 bucks I'm not looking to spend.

Essentially with major wireless providers, on a $600 phone, you pay $200 up front, and the other $400 throughout the rest of the contract. I've paid $300 of that ($200 deposit, 5 months built into the plan @ $20 a month). 

Here's the deal: I'm looking to do a [Change of Responsibility](http://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-2513) on my current plan. If you do one of these, I'm not billed for the ETF, and you (or I) don't have to buy the phone. I'm giving it to you for free. You have to pass T-Mobile's credit check, and be eligible for their service. You will need to have a new number activated, as I'm taking my number with me. [According to this,](http://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3361) that fee potentially may be waived, and if they do charge $35 for a new number, I'll split it with you. 

I'm paying $88 bucks a month currently, and as far as I'm aware you can change the plan to your liking. I'm 5 months in on a 24 month contract. It's going to be 18 months long, and you'll have a new phone. I have put Ice Cream Sandwich on this phone, through Samsung's proprietary Kies software. It's pretty tight. The phone itself is damn near perfect condition, as I take care of my electronics. I've got the box with the manual, and the charger as well. 


I'm looking for someone in the Denver area to do this with, as I'd like to go to a store to have it done, so that you know what you're getting into, and I can be assured that the phone is wiped. No offense, I just don't want you calling up my peoples.  T-Mobile has great service that I've experienced. I live in Arvada and work in the Tech Center. The only troubles I have are when I'm in a building, however I'm nearly always connected to WIFI when I'm inside. I want to wait until I receive my Sprint phone, which should arrive to me in less than a week. 

**WHAT YOU GET:** 

Galaxy S II, Model SGH-T989, Android version 4.0.3, 1.97Gb system/internal memory, 11.25Gb storage memory, Black. Bodyglove case (white with gray accents). 

18 months on a T-Mobile Contract. Currently, it's at 500 minutes/mo., unlimited texting, unlimited data (2 Gb on 4G speed, the rest on Edge network speed). It currently costs me 88 bucks a month. 

You don't have to pay that pesky $200 deposit on a phone. 

A burrito at Chipotle for you, and possibly your friend (if you decide to bring one), on me. There's one on Wadsworth near the store I'd prefer to go to, I'll pick you up (if absolutely needed). 

**WHAT I GET:**

Out of my T-Mobile contract, without paying $200 Early Termination, and without paying $300 device buyout fee.

**Day 2:** Organize the applications with the top being the most interesting to you and viable for your work experience, filling them all out.

**Day 3:** Wear business casual and drop by and shake hands with whoever you can find at the top that's working during (usually 2-4pm) prime business hours and get your name and face out there.

**Status:** Back from the dentist. I'm finishing up The_Art_God's project how I feel it should be done. 

My new order:
* The_Art_God

* DriftingMemes

* TrollyG-Yo

* kenkopin

* glowinthedark

* lskalt.

**&lt;/Notice&gt;!!**

**&lt;Notice&gt;!!**:
I'm going to finish everything you guys post (that falls within the realm of: mathematical possibility, reasonability, and scope), but it would be supremely helpful if you gents would PM me a reliable way to contact you (An IM system, an IRC network, or hell, if you don't have any of those, my facebook page is [here](http://facebook.com/patshanahan) Just some way I can confirm requirements for your application so I can really make you happy.
**&lt;/Notice&gt;!!**


I'm out of projects, and want to do some fun stuff. I'll make a small command line or GUI tool in Python for your user pleasure. Let me know what you'd like and I'll get it done ASAP.

Edit: Any recent platform. Well, I can do Mac but it's going to take me a while longer if it's GUI.

Edit 2:

Current List of projects:

1. ~~00spool: Fraction Converter. Finished.~~
2. TrollyG-Yo: Automagical credits removal from a series of videos.
3. DriftingMemes: Simple ticket tracking system. Probably gonna use Django.
4. lskalt: Simple IRC bot that plays a card game.
5. ~~silent_p: 500x500 pixel random color image creation.~~ Completed by Scalawag.
6. kenkopin: Awesome settings manager and reverter for Windows. 
7. The_Art_God: EXIF recursive image renamer.
8. glowinthedark: Theatre seat reservation system.

Edit 3: The_Art_God isn't responding to my PM, so I'm bumping that to the bottom.

Edit 4: I couldn't help myself. Sorry, I'm pretty much working on all of the requests at once. I thought lskalt's request would be the simplest, when in fact it turned out to be the hardest. I imagined kenkopin's request would be the hardest, and it's turning out the simplest.

I can't promise a time frame on any of these, but I imagine I'll have most if not all of them done by tomorrow night. I'll be up till then.

Edit 5: Since many of those who request projects aren't still around, I've decided to elucidate my ideas that I would post the (unedited) journal that I keep about projects.

    00spools fraction converter: 
    Pretty simple. Take the input txt file, do a for loop on the lines, split the lines in two by the ' x ' argument, take the first argument of that result as a string, and take the fraction as a string.split('/'), cast the two results as floats, convert back to a string, return that, concatenate it, finally return it to a list which is written to either the output or output file.
    
    The_Art_God's EXIF recursive renamer:
    Not as easy. I think I'll take an os.walk through each subdirectory from the path provided, or cwd if not provided. Check supported EXIF formats (JPG, TIFF AFAIK) and see if Exif's 'Image DateTime' tag is set. Assuming it is, partition that with a space delimiter. Take the partition[0] and do partition[0].split('/"") and use the year, month, date format to assign the appropriate file prefix, do a simple ""'mv %s %s' % (file,date_fix+os.path(file))"" or something similar *nix platforms, 'rename' with similar arguments on windows. 
    
    TrollyG-Yo's Automagical credits:
    Simple enough. Read a directory's XML file, validate, and do a batch FFMPEG job with logging and piping to subsect the approriate sections of the video files. This is a no brainer, just very dependent on platform specific paths. cfgparser will be necessary if I want it to be cross platform.
    
    DriftingMemes ticket tracking:
    Django. Ten minutes, max. This was the first project I ever tackled on Django. Maybe I should do it next, but I'm trying to preserve order.
    
    lskalt's IRC card bot:
    Man, this is a lot harder than I thought. Connecting to IRC isn't hard at all, and neither is privmsg'ing, but maintaining the socket connection while simultaneously syncing two users together is surprisingly hard. File locks are in order. Still need to figure out command system, and develop the class for the unique deck. What a fucked up game.
    
    silent_p's random image generator:
    ~~Generating a random image isn't hard, I'm just confused by what this guy means by his distribution statement.~~ nm, scalawag took care of it.
    
    kenkopin's amazing idea:
    Sweet motherfucker I'm so down for this. I think I have the reg keys here:
    
    Key: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced
        
        &gt;  Value: Hidden (hidden file visibility)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Show, 0(2?) = No
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value: HideFileExt !(Show exts)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 0 = Show, 1 = No
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value:  ShowSuperHidden (OS file visibility)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Show, 0 = No
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value:  ShowSuperHidden (OS file visibility)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Show, 0 = No
        &gt;    
        &gt;  Value: SuperHidden (Toggle for superhidden attr.)
        &gt;  Type: REG_DWORD
        &gt;  Answers: 1 = Enable, 0 = Disable
        


    
    So the key is backing up the  HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\, toggling/creating the aforementioned keys to (0, 1, 1, 0), initializing a non-intrusive reg restore on startup from the backed-up reg file (probably do a full reg-back too, jic), deleting the built python binaries from that startup file, and keeping those reg backups in a hidden folder. 
        
    Find out how to add a startup problem, use _winreg to do a create if !key, or open if key.

I registered for a reseller account some time ago and never actually did anything with it. I have 500GB of bandwidth a month and never use all of it. My hosting company gives out free licenses to WHMCS so setting up a payment system was pretty easy.

If anyone is interested, I'm offering, for **free**, web hosting accounts complete with CPanel.

To take advantage of this, you can go to http://ryankearney.com/whmcs/link.php?id=1 and add ""Cheap-o"" hosting to your cart with a **1 Year term**. During checkout, enter the promotional code **reddit** and your bill will be reduced to $0. 

**Note: The reddit coupon will only work with a 1 year, ""Cheap-o"" package**

Some things to note however.

* I haven't had a chance to go through and test all the purchases and whatnot. I consider this free offer to be my testing.
* Please don't create an account if you aren't going to use it.
* If you decide you don't want your account anymore, please cancel it so I can free up server resources.
* The Cheap-o free package has a 1GB/Month of bandwidth. If you need more, and you probably will, please submit a ticket and I will happily increase your bandwidth cap at no charge to you. This low value is setup because my reseller account can't over-sell bandwidth or disk space.
* Domain names aren't free, should you chose to register one.
* I have not yet tested my eNom domain name reseller account, so I have no idea if it works.
* It's best if you just register a domain with GoDaddy and point the name servers to mine.
* If you do register a domain name through me, there may be a delay in the approval of your account.

okay, lets get to business. i found this subreddit just now and i am so happy to see all those people in need getting help. (also a little shoutout for everyone that provides help. &lt;3 every single one of you is awesome &lt;3)

i really want to be a part of it. but as of now, i dont have any spare money to give. but i happen to be a pretty kind person. and i like to talk to people. i like to listen. i like to help! 

some input about myself: i'm a 22 year old girl that spends way to much time on reddit. im a psychology student and am also working in retail. i love conversations. the kind of conversations with a complete stranger that go on forever and ever. just talking about life, what you are struggling with everyday. friends tell me im a wise person always providing a helpful and cheering point of view in complicated situations. the best compliment i ever got was ""everyone else is making any uncomplicated situation so complicated. with you its the other way around. you solve every problem within a matter of seconds""

so yeah, if you need someone to cheer you up, someone to talk to for a few hours a day, someone that listens to your story, someone that is there for you when everyone else left, let me know. id be very happy to help :)",,False,,t5_2re6a,1356690864.0,,,True,t3_15jne9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/15jne9/offer_a_shoulder_to_lean_on_someone_to_keep_you/,

I'm not usually the type to ask for help but we're down to the wire here. Me, my girlfriend and our 4 year old daughter need a place to stay.

Our friends turned out to be pretty flaky as well and we want to start anew somewhere else.

We have a car rented Monday for the next week and are willing to relocate just about anywhere and start our lives over. We can pay rent and help with the bills as long as its not too extravagant. We'll only have about $1000/month income until we're able to find jobs. 

I have checked craigslist, but right now we'd only have about $450 for any kind of downpayment and people looking for roommates aren't too keen on families. We don't do drugs, smoke or party. We keep to ourselves for the most part and our 4 year old daughter is well behaved. 

I apologize if I posted this in the wrong subreddit, but it seemed the most appropriate at the time. If I left out any relevant info ill update it here for all to see. Thanks guys.

It went really well!  I sent out about 50 valentines and I got a dozen or so in return.  Some of them were REALLY awesome, and I had a wonderful time doing the project.  You guys are the best!

So, my birthday is coming up and I'd like to do something similar this time.  I'll send *you* a present (it's going to be something very small, owing to budget constraints)!  If you would like to send one to me (or a card, or a picture, or a postcard, or anything), that would be totally *awesome*, but I don't expect you to :)

My birthday is in July, but I'm posting this now so I have time to make this project a success.  Also, many of you will probably forget about this post between now and then and come July will say to yourselves ""WTF, who is this random person sending me shit!?""

A few caveats:

* Because I'm in the US I'd like to ship to the US to save myself some cash, but some of the best valentines I got last time were from Intl. redditors :)  So if you really want to participate and you're from another country PM me and I'll do my best.

* When you PM me your name and address, please send me the FULL address (including a name the Post Office will acknowledge you as) of where you will be in JULY.  For the valentines, I had a bunch returned to me as undeliverable because of wonky addresses.  I'd like to avoid that this time!

* I'll send out as much awesomeness as I can, but I'll probably have to cap the number at 50 just so that I can continue to buy food and pay rent and whatnot.  However, if I don't reach that number in a month or so I'll let you guys know in another post in case there's anyone else that would like a totally awesome present in the mail.

* If you'd like to send me something in return you can wait until you get yours first, or I can give you my address.  My birthday is in early July, and I love getting mail!  If you want to send me a card, postcard, or a drawing of your cat, or a picture you drew of [a ninja lighting himself on fire](http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y2/TanKLoveR/ninja.jpg) that would be awesome.  I loved every single valentine I got, and if you think it's cool I probably will too :)

But that's wasteful, so I'd rather someone use it.  For various reasons I don't feel like typing out (because it'd be paragraphs) I can't really book any of my friends.  

Where?  It would be a short flight.  Common ones that are coming up as cheap are Indy &lt;-&gt; Chicago or Milwaukee or NY &lt;-&gt; Boston or DC

When? Sometime in the next three weekends.  Thu-Sat, Fri-Sun, etc

Hotel? Yup, there would be a hotel, I don't care if you use it or not.

Round-trip? Yup, again, don't care if you use it or not.

Details: 

* You need to provide me with full name and information for me to book it
* I can work with you on flight times/hotel only somewhat
* I am expecting to pay for this completely, around $210-250, however if you throw money my way, $50 or $100 or what you can afford, I can increase the budget and get a better hotel, or a further flight, etc.
* I'm not covering taxis or incidentals or anything like that of course.  All that is your responsibility.

Contact: We'll discuss details over AIM or GTalk, you can pm me your details or post them here. 

This is a pretty big gift, with potential for me to get screwed, or you to exploit it.  I am hoping for neither.  Instead, I'd like this to be a good story in the end.

Someone who has had a shitty week?,SgtSloth,72,19,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/h9lql/offer_and_request_i_guess_someone_who_has_had_a/,"So i'm just some guy who had a shitty week so far and I feel better when I make other people who are having a shitty time feel better.

So I just want to hear why someone has had a shitty week and want to send them something awesome. Don't expect a new Maserati or something, but just a little something to brighten someones day. I could just hand some weird random thing to a stranger, but I would rather help out a fellow redditor and make someone feel better. It won't be amazing, but happiness can come from simple things too.

I don't know if this will get any response, or if it will get a ton of hits, but I will go through the stories if there are any and pick one or maybe two people who I think could use some cheering up and send them something I think will hopefully lift their spirits a little.

So post what's been shitty about your week and i'll be in touch!

If I don't pick you, sorry, I am not a rich dude. Just want to do a little something for someone who could use a little something.

EDIT 1: This isn't meant to be ""a pissing contest"" as was stated. And really in the end I will probably just pick a couple people at random.  This doesn't need to be a contest. I'd be content hearing ""Yeah, my week has been shitty too man."" 

If people lie, oh well. I'm just trying to do something nice, and in the end if it even makes a happier person happier, great. This isn't meant to be anything more than just trying to do something cool for a couple people.

I appreciate those that have contributed so far!

EDIT 2: I am actually amazed this hasn't turned hostile, and for that I THANK YOU ALL! I have been reading through every bodies situations and appreciate you sharing very much. It keeps me grounded knowing that yeah things get bad for me at times, but there is always people out there with worse situations and a lot of times they are still being more positive despite their bad luck.

I hope it is helping people get some things out they just need to tell someone about (even a stranger on the internet). I know sometimes I just need to rant, but a lot of times posting something on the net just gets you a bunch of ass hats that want to create trouble. I don't care how minute the issue is (first world problems even) it still sucks and letting it go without being judged feels good.

Seriously, people are being pretty damn mature about this so far. That makes me feel good about doing this. Keep em coming. I'm reading them all and though I wish I could send everyone some cool stuff, I will be choosing a couple people in the next day or so and getting in touch.

Here is to hoping this continues to stay mature and continues to let people get shit off their chest and also help them see a brighter side of life no matter what they are going through! Redditors are my favorite.

EDIT 3: Hey everyone. I have chosen a couple people pretty randomly from names of those that shared that they have had a shitty past week or so and will hopefully get their packages out to them soon!

I want to thank everyone for sharing. I have been asked a few times why my week was so shitty, and it wasn't really things that have happened, but it's been one of those weeks where you find yourself at a low point wondering where you fucked up and question wtf you are even doing. I have had a hard time staying awake during the day at all. My health (type 1 diabetes and a pace maker screw with my body) is just feeling pretty crap and I am having a hard time finding energy. I have been having a hard time socializing at all and have spent 100% of my time for the past couple weeks absolutely alone. I can't figure out how to meet people. So it just gets ya down ya know. So being depressed is why I decided to do this and it has helped raise my spirits some and hopefully when I get these packages shipped off I will feel a little more accomplished with my goal of helping someone else feel better.

It turns out he has a drug resistant heartworm. We've been giving him ""Revolution"" once a month for 5 months, and he had 3 shots of (I can't remember but there's only 2 choices apparently) drugs. One shot, then a month later one shot on consecutive days. They just tested for the microflanaria (sp?) and there are still some. The won't test for the adult female until Feb, but I fear if there are still eggs after all this, that there must still be a female worm.

A side note is that on the 3rd shot (day 2 of the second dose), he did not get sick or show any of the side effects like the first two. Instead he grew this huge lump on his back(the injection site) that was warm to the touch and I believe we got zero benefit from that shot. I want to blame the vet and ask for another *free* shot, but at this point I think we'd need to repeat the 3 shots.

I don't want money, but we can't afford another $1500 round of treatment that may or may not work. Can you provide me the drugs he needs cheaper? Is that legal (I'm in Canada)?

Any help appreciated.

He is only 16 months old. He was diagnosed at around 10 months which means he contracted it very soon after birth. He is a rescue dog so I don't know any more history.

Want to track your budget? Impress your boss? Track your fitness? I CAN HELP!

Why Excel? Because it's flexible, and most people and businesses are already familiar with it.

So, PM me or leave a comment detailing your spec. Be as detailed as possible. Your basic table structure is *required*, some sample data would be amazing. If you can sketch a rough, excellent, otherwise I'll just wing it. Be sure to detail any interactivity (check boxes, drop downs, sliders) you'd like, too.

Obviously, I can't connect this to your datasource without access to your precious data, so if you need the dashboard to be automated / live, we can talk about it once it's built.

Some examples;

[A sales performance dashboard.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6926046/salesdash.png)

[A health and fitness tracking dashboard.](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/6926046/hwdash.PNG)

I'm doing these in my own time, and being a father of 2 young boys and working a 10 hour a day job, it may take me a few days to give you your dashboard, but I promise I'll get it done!

1318906195.0,56,self.Favors,lfvkj,"[MOD] Hey /r/favor-ites, your mod team has re-written the rules, and now's your chance to chip in before we finalize them.  ",Anomander,67,11,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/lfvkj/mod_hey_rfavorites_your_mod_team_has_rewritten/,"**/r/Favors exists as a place for redditors to offer and ask neighborly favors of the community.** As the curators of what is essentially a regulated free-trade zone for generosity, we feel it is important to regularly re-assess the methods by which we preserve this community and the standards by which we assess its content. What follows is a discussion of the methods and standards currently in place, as well as an exploration of proposed changes.

The rules that govern /r/favors have been in place for over a year. We feel it is time to revisit these rules in the interest of better serving our community. The current rules value the health of /r/favors first, the health of the Reddit community second and the satisfaction of the individual redder third. Any changes to these rules will reflect these same core values.

**You, the community for whom we perform this task, are invited to discuss the current and future guidelines for its management.** Note that this is not a call for votes, nor will any potential changes be more or less likely to be implemented based on upvotes or downvotes. The modship of /r/favors was elected by popular vote with the mandate to operate it in the common interest. We will entertain persuasive arguments but will not take any suggestion into consideration based purely on its point total.

**How we moderate /r/favors**

The overwhelming majority of the work performed by the /r/favors mods involves interacting with the filter. More often than not, posts to /r/favors land in the filter first. Once there, it is up to us to decide whether we consider the post to be appropriate to /r/favors. Sheer luck will occasionally play a role in allowing posts to bypass the filter. Everybody wins if these posts are appropriate. If they are not, the moderation team is not always going to remove a post, particularly if it has points and comments, but this is not a guarantee of immunity for popular but rule-breaking posts. *We recognize that this is a less-than-ideal system* but we also recognize that Reddit offers a less-than-ideal architecture for dealing with the problem. Realistically speaking, it's the best we can do.

A post is judged on many criteria. These criteria are different for requests and offers. Offers are granted more latitude - someone offering to draw something, for example, is demonstrably more altruistic than someone wanting something drawn. If a post is offering something with no glaring strings attached or blatant problems, it gets through. While holding relatively strict criteria to people who want things seems reasonable to prevent abuse, we have no reason to prevent someone from giving something away. *Posts that are looking for trades or sales are held to the [REQUEST] standards, because the recipient is asked to risk something of their own*.

**Requests are judged by the following criteria:**    

 * **Is it financial?** The community has repeatedly asked that we keep all ""panhandling"" requests out, no exceptions, regardless of content. This includes charity drives, donations, ""good causes"" and any and all ""a-thons."" Our readership enjoys being generous, but loathes assessing whether someone is worthy of their generosity - therefore, that task falls to the moderators. As we have the exact same tools to judge trustworthiness as you do, we refuse to do so. *Since we can't judge who is ""worthy"" and who is not, we do not judge at all*.    
 * **Is it art?** The community has repeatedly chosen to disallow all forms of ""please draw me a thing."" This extends to logos, photoshop, photo restoration, picture coloring and design services of any kind. We permitted requests such as this for a weekend over a year ago and within 72 hours ""draw me a thing"" requests dominated the front page. We serve the community - and while the thing you want drawn is of keen interest to you, it is of near-zero interest to the community.    
 * **Is it voting?** /r/favors is not interested in rigging contests, nor do we consider padding numbers, providing viewers, adding followers, or any sort of attention exchange to be a ""favor"" per se.    
 * **Is it a referral?** Referrals, invites, and the like all have their own places on reddit. That place can be found in our sidebar.    
 * **Is the title honest?** A good example of a dishonest post is one titled ""[OFFER] Free Webdesign\*"" with ""\*if you sign up for my hosting service"" in the body. Posts that suggest one thing in the title and something else entirely in the content are removed. We contact the OP in marginal cases and suggest they try again with greater clarity.    

 * **Obvious ""joke"" posts get removed.** ""[REQUEST]: Harem,"" for instance. Or ""[Offer]: Meaning of life""; body text is just ""42"". These posts do not contribute anything meaningful. Contrast this to the chap offering nicknames, which while silly and somewhat inane, at least led to some really amusing conversations. 
* **Posts not containing a concrete favor or offer get pulled.** ""[Request] I has a sad, make me feel better"" are either better suited to any number of ""discussion"" communities, or they're thinly veiled panhandling requests (""send me messages to make me feel better, here's my steam ID""). 
 * **We also judge posts by the account posting them.** /r/favors exists as a place for redditors to do and ask for awesome stuff from each other. We require a clear demonstration that an account is a redditor first, and asking for things second. An account with high karma and age has more to lose and is more vulnerable to naming and shaming. New accounts with little activity are far more likely to be looking for a handout and far less likely to be participating in the community. We are far more likely to bend the rules for an account over 100 days old. New accounts with over 1000 karma are considered to be active contributors. Old accounts with no (or questionable) use may also be questioned.

 **Exemptions are never granted.** We're not judging you as a poster, we're judging the content of your post.

**Changes we'd like to propose**  

 * **No ""buy me a NEW game"" requests.** Reddit has /r/gameswap, which has enacted a good system to keep scammy shit to a minimum. We don't, and don't have the manpower to set one up and manage everything else /r/favors related. We wish to note, however, the ""new"" aspect of this request: Moderator Anomander has given away CD keys to most of his old, now unplayed, games here to folks requesting them. We propose that only games over four years old are legit to request, because the long-average update/expansion cycle is three years long. A four-year-old game is more likely to be sitting unplayed somewhere than Minecraft is.    
 * **Prices offered in trades/work for hire arrangments must be in the title.** ""Am willing to pay"" seems to have become ""I'll pay if you ask, but want it for free"". We want our artists to be able to decide if a request is offering enough to make it worth their time to bid. We further wish for any negotiations that begin at /r/favors stay as transparent as possible.    
 * **No ditch-digging?** Requests for others to perform tasks that require no skill, knowledge or experience beyond the ability to log onto Reddit are not considered to be a ""favor."" If your task could be performed by Amazon's Mechanical Turk service or a studious application of Google, you are not looking for neighborly help, you're looking for free labor. This includes vectorization of images, etc.    

**Changes we are willing to implement:** Anything suggested below, presuming it abides by or supports our core values: /r/favors first, reddit second, individual redditors third. Further, /r/favors is a representative democracy: you elected us as moderators to perform the tasks and enact the changes we feel are essential to its management. If you have ideas that are not implemented, we invite you to run for election when nominations open next.

  Sincerely,

My Grandma on my mom's side is very old and very ill, and as our family prepares for her passing, we've been going through her house, sorting, cleaning, etc.

In this process, we ran across what appear to be a few 78 rpm vinyls, which appear to be recordings of my grandma singing from wayyyyy back in the day. As best I can tell, they're in reasonably good (but, you know, very old) condition.

Now, when my grandpa passed, some years ago, we found a similarly ancient recording of him playing the oboe and played it at his funeral. We'd like to do something similar for my grandma, namely, get the recordings off the record and into digital format so that we can play them for her and, as my dad is want to say, ""preserve them for posterity"".

Not having even a vague expertise in this area, I'm turning to reddit and the internet. Do any of you out there know how to do this? I'm looking primarily for a professional service (website + testimonials would suffice), mainly because I think I'd have a hard time convincing my aunts and uncles to ship the only recording we have of my grandma singing to ""a kind stranger from the internet"". We're currently a bit south of Chicago, so if there's something in the Chicagoland area, you'd get bonus points!

If anyone performs or knows of somewhere that this can be done, please let me know! My Grandma, my family, and I would really appreciate it. Thanks!

**TL;DR** I need old 78's professionally converted to digital format without damaging the original vinyls for my dying Grandma, and have no idea how to accomplish that.

I'm in Jackson, MS. I've been putting in for a lot of jobs but nothing seems to be coming back at all - everything from bottom rung food-chain stuff to IT stuff. I've had 3 years of college, my major is illustration, but I don't have a degree yet. 

I'm still fighting with financial aid at colleges to recognize me as an independent student [I'm 22, but have filed my own taxes and am not supported by my parents.] This is proving difficult and terrifying and I'm not sure I'm going to be able to finish out any sort of degree. 

I'm good at: art, writing, making coffee, and entry level tech support.  I can also fix musical instruments. I'm a pretty decent church pianist, but most people have issues with having an agnosti-pagan leading their music. Oh right. I'm an amateur radio operator, and I have a concealed carry permit - not that this shit matters, but y'know... 

Even though these are things I'm good at, I'll do just about anything legal. I'm an asthmatic, 5'3"" girl with a fucked up left knee, so physical labor is kinda out. :\

So, if you need someone for your game [and can pay me], if you need someone to write you things, or do calligraphy, or tarot readings, or fix your clarinet or *something*, I'm your girl. 

Go? &lt;3

This can be a post you want me to answer, a thread you want me to open, or, if you want to discuss over PM'ing, that's fine too(as long as it is with you. I won't contact others).

When I discuss, it's [serious business](http://wiki.aie-guild.org/images/d/df/Serious_business_logo.jpg). I check facts thoroughly, show my sources and explain points in a tidy manner. I spend as long as it takes, formulating a post to make my points crystal clear, and make the post impenetrable. I'm a perfectionist. If you hire me(for the modest fee of null dollars), you got a force to reckon with on your side. Or against you, if you just feel like discussing.

Let the debating commence!

tl;dr: I'm a debate whore. PM me a viewpoint you want me to defend.

*Edit:*

Huh, turns out more people found it interesting than I thought. Thought I might get contacted by one or two. As of now, I've accepted two self-debates, and I have 4 PM's. Not sure whether I got the capacity for the 11 other challenges. 

I'll do my best to answer the Radiohead &amp; terrorist requests, but to be honest, Radiohead is sort of outside my field. I haven't heard a lot of their songs, and in order to really be able to lead this debate, I should have heard all of them, and know them. But I'll do my best. Just don't judge me based on that performance. 

*Edit # 2:* 

After much consideration(and thinking for 6,5 hours on a train, which did not have Internet, contrary to my initial belief - read: no research could be done), I have decided to not do self discussions. I could do it, but it wouldn't further my goal of wanting to test my discussion skills.

I've gotten a request I'm going to act on - opening a thread in /r/atheism and be against abortion, but from an atheist view, so no religious arguments. If you want to see me in action, I suggest you pay attention to that thread. I will link to it here when I've posted it. But; tomorrow. I've spent 25% of my day on a train, and it's late.

That said, I’m also very good with Access (not to sound gloaty) which includes Back to Front end &amp; user form design, and a *bit* of Access VBA.

Excel is my main playground though, and I’m very capable of writing many different types of VBA sub-routines (or macros) if anyone is in need of one that’s not too daunting.  Of course this also includes any general spreadsheet functions/formatting/you name it…so, please let me know if anyone needs any help.

It’s technically the weekend now, so I’ll be hanging around and checking in periodically until Monday morning.  I’ll try to answer all the questions (if any) that I receive, so if I don’t get to yours right away, please don’t worry…I’ll get to it eventually.

The rules are as follows:

1. You must post detailing why you deserve to win this contest. Proof included with your story is highly encouraged, as this will give credence to it, increasing your chances of winning.

2. You must also post a link to a picture or video showing you helping someone in need (carrying an old lady's groceries, reading to kids with cancer, saving someone's life, etc). **You must be the one in the picture or video.** Prove this by submitting a photo time-stamped between now and 11 Nov 2011 with the submission.

3. You must also post a picture of you drinking a Red Bull in a creative fashion. (This is solely due to my reddit name. I am in no way affiliated with Red Bull or their tasty products) [Example.](http://imgur.com/InYPJ)
**But due to alot of people hating Red Bull, for some god awful reason, I shall amend this: Coffee and tea are acceptable alternatives.**

4. The winner is the person with the most upvoted submission at 10:00 P.M MST Thursday the 10th of November, 2011. **Downvotes will not count.** I will then PM the winner and obtain their Steam ID and purchase the much anticipated game for them.

5. I'm counting on fellow redditors to assist in catching cheaters. If you suspect someone is posting pictures or videos that are not legitimate, reply to the post in question with hard evidence.

Let the games begin.

1292049607.0,47,self.Favors,ejyzi,[request] Christmas is looking a bit bleak for me this year...  Is it OK to ask for holiday cards and/or maybe something small and nice?,sezzme,58,11,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/ejyzi/request_christmas_is_looking_a_bit_bleak_for_me/,"I am a woman with stage 4 breast cancer.  I've lost a lot of things I care about to this disease.  I've been really overwhelmed with just a lot of sad stuff - especially these last few months - since I've been a bit of a shut-in most of this year.  Also realizing all the dreams I've lost along the years - before I even knew I had them - has really started to sink in.

I'm wondering if it's ok to risk asking for something positive for Christmas from Reddit to cheer me up a little. 

Is it OK to ask someone out there send me maybe something small and nice so I could have something to look forward to this Christmas?  Cards or whatever?

If you'd like to send something that matches my tastes, here ya go:
Kate Bush, classic anolog synthesizers, space stuff (astronomers such as Carl Sagan, images from the Hubble telescope, the works of JPL engineers, etc.), science, physics, Mythbusters, xkcd, geek jokes, even if I don't always understand the more obscure ones.  

I like the shows on channels such as Discovery, Sci, TLC etc. that feature innovative engineers in various fields who get to create, build and improve new, cool stuff.  I often end up wishing so much that I could have been like them.

I also love mourning doves.  Something about seeing a member of that bird species is just so very comforting to me - that's just an odd thing with me, I guess.   Maybe I couldn't have a great life of happily being able to hang with, talk to and work with wonderful, innovative, inventive, techy engineers (damn, I'm feeling so damn wistful now), but at least the mourning doves are always out there.   

Sometimes when I am really sad, I might go outside and see if there is a dove out there for me to look up to and appreciate.  Something about that often helps my spirit.

I have a private mail box at one of those mailbox store places.  Maybe PM me for my physical address... or ask me for my email address if you have something nice that can be sent by email.

A few words of comfort for hard times would be OK too.

Thanks in advance for any positive thoughts.

1267233769.0,49,self.Favors,b719d,[Request] Can someone help me find my best friend from middle school who just up and disappeared one day?,halbowitz,55,6,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/b719d/request_can_someone_help_me_find_my_best_friend/,"OK, 'we' found him. Reddit is amazing.
Im going to prune some info out of here that is no longer necessary.
Im trying to get him to send me something here so you all can see he was found. Will update in/when he does.

I also have offered to give the 'finder' a 'reward' for finding him.
Im not going to post the 'finders' name unless they want me to.

Anyhow, I will update this agai, shortly, i hope.


I originally posted this in Reddit Detectives but that subreddit is more or less dead and was told this might be the next best place to try, so...

So, ive been wanting to do this for some time. Find my friend but i was a bit hesitant about posting personal info about him here. And i still kind of am but I really want to find this guy and Ive been looking for him for more then a decade. I'll try and keep his private info to a minimum.

Now, i know some people might think that there is no way for you to know that i actually don't have malicious intent. I can't argue with that. But all I'm looking for is his email address. I actually was able to find his potential address online And if it comes down to it, i guess ill send him a letter. But im pretty sure, although my memory is hazy, that i called that house 5 years ago or so and concluded it was not him. Although, not sure on his middle name so i cant be sure the one i found online is the same one. 

 Anyhow, there are sites out there that claim they have his email address on file. I would pay for it but the ones i found want my CC number and im not about to give it up to some site like that. If they used Paypal, i would do it, but they don't.

A Facebook page would even be better.

Anyhow, his name is M Alderman.

Last i visited him he lived in Elyria Ohio. This was way back in the day. Im guessing maybe 1995 or so.

I went to school with him at Linwood Middle School, in North Brunswick NJ. 87-89 i think (him, i was 86-88 i think). I don't think he went on to high school due to family issues. Well, at least in NJ. If he did it would of been North Brunswick Township High, NJ. But I don't think he did, or if he did, certainly only his freshman year.

His Grandfather was/is B Kane.

His father owned some business (CPA?) on Livingston ave in New Brunswick NJ. Again, this was back in the day though. Not sure anymore.

He should be around my age. Im pretty sure he was the class after me (i was in 8th, him in 7th). But he should be 34 or 35 now.

He was married at least once.

Anyhow, i have info on him if you want. Info a friend would know but not things like his SS or anything. Just PM me. Like i said, im hesitant to put down all his info.

(deleted out story)

I assumed he would contact me at some point. He never did.

I really think the guy is dead. I don't see why he would avoid me even if he was ashamed of what he did. Unless maybe he lost my contact info but with Facebook and Myspace coming into the scene in the past years its not all that hard to find me.

And if for some weird reason someone knows the guy, tell him Hal is looking for him.

Oh, and the email addys listed that i cant read, that might be his are.. M******A@___.COM and M***********N@___.COM

Anyhow, any help would be appreciated and Ill do anything i can do validate this whole thing as being legit.

*edit :If this doesn't pan out that someone can help me here, directly, does anyone have any other ideas besides Zabasearch and Pipl?


More info: i was hesitant to talk about his Grandfather but it does have names. so...

[His Grandfather](http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1024.html): He is survived by his wife, Elizabeth Sanders Kane, an actress; a daughter, Deborah Majeski of New Jersey; a sister, Doris Atlas of New York; a grandson, Matthew Alderman, and, of course, Batman, Robin, the Joker, the Riddler, the Penguin and the Catwoman 

As you can see his Grandfather was the creator of Batman. I got to talk to the guy. A highlight of my life. He asked me if i thought Dick Tracy would do well in the theater. This was right after the 1st batman with Keaton was released. He seemed concerned it would do better than Batman. He then sent me a hand drawn pic of Batman and Robin.

A rather classy one-pager, if I do say so myself.  It's 1:00AM here in lucid Melbourne, Australia.  I took a break to go for a twilight walk through some old victorian neighbourhoods and took a look at the ocean.  On the way in to the apartment I passed by the neighbour-girls and got the chance for some face-toface interaction.  Aside from that, I've worked my buttocks off today.  :)

Special thanks to buggedcom for helping people get their information together for me.  I still have a few people to do and I have others that I just can't go forward with unless I get more info.  Also, I'm getting requests who have the same qualifications as me (Adobe skillz).  Dudes.  If you can work the software then you should be doing your own resumes.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


EDIT 3:  Just to keep everyone updated, I just finished the first resume!  I think it looks great, but we'll see what the dude says.  If he doesn't mind his personal info being shared here then I'll post the resume here.  It was pretty hard to get a feel for the guy's personality so I took to a more neutral tone.  It's 7:36PM in glorious Melbourne, Australia and I'm starving.  I'm going to go get a sammich and then I'll come back and give it another go if I have enough material to work with.  If not then I guess I'll head on over to r/pics.  Apparently I made the front page there today :D  It's nice to feel loved.

EDIT 2:  Somebody call Clay Shirky 'cause I'm using my cognitive surplus for generosity up in here!


If you need a Resume:  I want your old resumes (all of them).  I want you to tell me about your accomplishments and favourite things about each job (talk to me like I'm a person, not a boss).  I want you to tell me why you need a resume, where are you coming from in life?, where are you going?  What types of jobs are you applying for.  Send all of this to AaronInTheForest@Hotmail.ca.  THE MORE YOU HAVE DONE = THE EASIER IT IS FOR ME TO HELP YOU!


If you do NOT need a resume:  I need help, not karma!  Look at all these people who are looking to improve their lives.  If you can help copy write, proof read, critique or design then I want you to hijack this thread!  And for the love of Flying Spaghetti Monsters, stop upvoting or we'll end up on the frontpage, and NOBODY WANTS THAT.  If you want to give me karma then upvote this cute pic of me playing cars with my nephew:  http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/f6e5h/i_love_my_nephews_toys_waaaaay_more_than_he_does/

I'm going to get working on some resumes.  I've got this great one about


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ORIGINAL POST:  I posted my resume (http://imgur.com/a/xjsPI#HPabm) in a thread (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/f5gcl/iama_person_who_has_hired_a_lot_of_people_if_you/) and everyone was very kind about my resume.  

It was a huge boost to my self esteem and I'm proud to say that 24 hours after making this resume, I have a job offer and 3 more interviews to do.

I am offering to do somebody else's resume as a token of gratitude to Reddit.  Originally, I kind of envisioned this as a contest but so far only one guy seems interested.  I'm cool with that.  If others want to post a little about themselves and their job search stories here then maybe I can help.

I'm dedicating Saturday (tomorrow) to resumes.


EDIT 1:  Good Morning Reddit!  It's 9:06AM on an overcast Saturday morning here in lovely Melbourne Australia!  I literally JUST woke up and am lying naked in bed with my laptop.  Upon opening Reddit today I found that I had ten times the karma that I had last night and was terrified that this post had gone frontpage.  fortunately, most of that karma is from r/pics.  This is still a pretty big thread.  PLEASE STOP UPVOTING THIS.  I don't want it getting bigger.  Unless people are joining the thread to offer help in designing/writing/profreading resumes.

So here's the problem:  I obviously can't do every body's resume.  I'm not even sure I can do all the resumes that really need it (dude who wrote me because he loves his DAD and wants to help him get a job and his life back...  yeah. um  I think I got something in my eye).

So there's going to have to be a way to select the winner's of my favour.  

Or....   

OR!   

Or there's going to have to be a lot more of me's.  Does anybody know of a community of designers on Reddit that might be feeling generous?  Designers dislike doing free work (we get asked to do it A LOT) but maybe today can be a fun day of designing resumes.  We should also ask copywriters to get in on this.  And proof readers!  

SO HERE'S WHAT I'M GOING TO DO:  I'm going to shower, brush my teeth, go to the grocery store and buy some ramen, some black liquorice gum and some munchies.  I'm going to come back here and pick a resume to start working on.  I'm swamped with orangereds so I think I'll make a gmail account to talk to the people I am helping.  DO NOT SEND YOUR EMAIL'S TO MY ACTUAL GMAIL PLEASE.  I've still got interview requests coming in there and I don't need a ton of traffic.

I love you all and I'll see you in a little bit.  It's going to be a great day, sports fans!  A great day!",,False,,t5_2re6a,True,,,True,t3_f6eyb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/f6eyb/offeri_will_design_a_resume_for_you/,

In October in L.A., I found myself without a tie for a suit and tie party. A kind gentleman gave me a tie and told me that since he doesn't travel a lot, and I do, he would like me to take the tie with me and document it in pics around the world. I have done that ever since.
This gave me a good idea!
 
While I do realise that there are many redditors who travel way more than me, I still feel i cover my fair share of miles. I live in Copenhagen, and have been in the US 5 times, and all over Europe during the last few years. As I am becoming more financially comfortable, this list will surely expand, as i love traveling and seeing different cultures more than anything else. 

I am offering to travel with something you send me for as long as i can. The tie gave me a good idea, but you know, a tie is just a tie. I want something so unique and extraordinary, exotic or symbolic, that i would even consider going to a place **just** to take pictures of it there. 

I am going on a roadtrip from Copenhagen to Porto soon. If i recieve your ""gift"" before that, you will already have some pics of it all over Europe soon. Remember, this will be a gradual process, but i am fully commited to do this forever. Be creative ;) 

oh, and here are a few pics already, with the tie :

My dad's family has a yearly reunion on Father's day weekend that's not too far from where we live on Long Island. I'm trying to work out a way to get him there to see our family.  He's been able to get into our car for previous events but this past winter has been really hard on him (he has PPMS - Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis) and he can no longer get into/out of a smaller car or transfer in and out of a scooter.   Since this might be the last year that he can get out for any extended period of time, I wanted to see if there were any disabled redditors out there that might have a van I could borrow for that weekend. 

I know there's an option to rent vans--we've done that in the past--but we just can't afford it this year. My fiance and I had my dad move in with us a couple years ago and the one apartment rental we found that could fit his chair and allow him to live a semi-normal life eats a good portion of our monthly income. We did try a while back to save for a van and give my dad a little semblance of freedom but something always comes up and drains the ability right out of savings (woo timing belt!). We really are only able to get him out of the house for an event like this once or maybe twice per year and last time we got him into our car it came with great physical exhaustion (for him).

I would be willing to provide delicious baked goods and my eternal gratitude as well as proof of insurance and a clean driving record. I'm also no stranger to physical labor and would be willing to do almost anything--like scanning all of your old family photos or painting that back room you just can't get to...anything.  

Some details of the proposed trip: It's not that long of a drive (~40 minutes) and I have experience driving large RVs, moving trucks and accessible vans without incident. Would return the van with a full tank and make sure it's clean and perfect before bringing it home.

So, if there's anyone out there not using an accessible van for father's day weekend and would be willing to let a complete stranger borrow it on promises of safe return, please let me know :)

edit: I know how generous everyone can be with money on reddit and I just want to say that if you want to help monetarily, I really hope you look at other posts in r/assistance. When I look at things here I just think that they need help so much more than I do that I can't really justify asking for the money. I think I figured if I was asking someone for a van they weren't using it would be different, you know? Like, my dad would be sad if we couldn't get him out there for the day but we can still pay the rent, have a home and can barbeque.",,False,,t5_2re6a,True,,,True,t3_hjw0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/hjw0f/request_wheelchair_accessible_van_for_fathers_day/,

So please request things and I will paint them for you.


I mainly paint in watercolor. I'll paint any picture for you, and if you would like I could also ship it to you for free, if you don't want me to send it to you that is fine also. I would prefer not to send them outside of the United States, unless I get some help with the shipping costs. These paintings will mainly be small, 5""x5"" 4""x4"", 5""x7"" or somewhere around there. Bigger things use more materials, take more time, and are harder to ship. But anyway... I would be happy to paint pictures for you.  


Also I have watercolor paper post cards that I could send you. So if you would prefer it in post card format that would be pretty easy. I also have a bunch of small trading card sized papers that I have too. Those would be easy to ship also. 

[Here is an example of a trading card size painting](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_UosFstW-TLY/SrLa0xXhleI/AAAAAAAAABo/piLBupbHOVg/s1600/wc+ACEO+birds+trees.png) its i think 2.5""x3.5""

[Here is an example of a 5""x5"" sized painting](http://imgur.com/VhGCJ)



If you do want me to send you the painting, all of the paper is acid free so if kept in proper environments the paintings could last 100+ years.


I don't want to paint copyrighted photos so please if you want me to paint a photo please own the rights to it, or if its in the public domain that is fine too.


I will be devoting as much effort as possible to these paintings and will try to do my best, you can see some of my previous paintings [here](http://isaacquinton.blogspot.com)


I'm not that good at painting people but... If you want me to I can try to do it, it just might suck though but it would be good practice for me.


If you don't specify a certain size I'll paint it on whatever size I feel like. I can try to do certain styles too but I don't have much experience in that but it would also be good practice.

**Edit #2: Okay, I'm back now. This will probably a take a long time. I will still try to do every painting but it just might end up taking a week or two... if I get more requests maybe longer. When I have started your painting I'll tell you.**

**Edit #3: The post cards are 4x6 inches and I could send them inside of an envelope I think so that if you want to use them for your own use you can, also it should protect them a bit from water damage that might happen.**

**Edit #5 Oh god, what have I done... lol. Anyway I'll still try to get around to painting everyone's pictures, but I'm going to stop replying to new comments and messages for now. But I haven't forgotten about you, it just might take a couple weeks before I reply.**

**Edit #6: Okay I think I have too many requests. But I'll still try to do a lot though I might not get to everyone.**

**Edit#7: I am very overloaded. I will not be able to get to every painting, if I were to paint every request it would take me literally hundreds of hours to paint them all. I'll try to paint pictures for the people I have replied to first, after that I'll pick and choose. I'll probably do one painting every day or two, depending on how detailed it is. Portraits will definitely take at least a day.**

**Edit#8: I'm a little busy doing stuff right now, planning for wedding, looking a jobs, and other things, but don't worry I'll try try to get to the people that I've responded too, And if I haven't responded to you maybe I'll get around to painting your picture in a year or so if the subject matter looks fun to paint.

Central &amp; Eastern respectively. 

So I've got a kitten. More to the point, Formated4tv has a kitten. My landlords found her in the snow in December and insisted I love her and keep her always. Problem was my ""vintage"" cat wanted no parts of her. I gave it 2 months and couldn't handle the hissing and unpleasantness around here so I posted here, in r/favors, for a new home. [Formated4tv stepped right up](http://www.reddit.com/comments/fs8sf/a_kitten_reddit_my_first_redditor_irl_good_karma/), I met him 

Formated4tv was a total rockstar and adopted her. Trouble is, his big bad doggy is a teensy bit scared of kittens (who knew?)...so we're left to find her a new forever home. 

[Here are some pics of the adorable chirping loving furr ball](http://imgur.com/a/TkGha#I3Jli)

No pressure or anything reddit but this is sort of our last chance before we have to resort to a shelter or a rescue. Any takers?

From the original Craigslist ad (I tried CL the same time as Reddit but got a creepy vibe from CL)

This breaks my heart to post this... 

This absolutely perfectly healthy, fun, cuddly, snuggly little ball of furry love needs a new forever home. 

She is fabulous and wants nothing more in the whole world than to run and play and do adorable kitten things. Unfortunately my ""vintage cat"", who has been with me for nearly 14 years has not, after 2 months, warmed up to her. It's getting worse in fact and I can't wake up to another morning of hissing and cat screeching. 

The kitten simply wants to play and my cat just sits in her rocking chair yelling, ""Get off my lawn you damn kids"" and ""Damn kids and their damn rap music"" at her...it's just not fair to my existing cat. It's far too stressful and after this long, if she was going to accept her she would have. 

Kitten was found in the snow just before Christmas, cold and shivering and hungry. She's adapted perfectly indoors and is quite happy to use the litter box and enjoys a dry food (kitten chow). 

I will include her litter box, bowl, adorable pink collar (with a bell so you always know where she is) and toys though to be honest, she's perfectly entertained with a paper bag and hair ties. 

Email me if you're serious about giving her a forever home where she'll be kept indoors and loved for always.

So if anyone is interested, here is what would help me draw the best picture of you:

A **good quality** picture of you, preferably not facing directly at the camera ( this is because it is difficult for me to draw perfectly symmetric, so it becomes much more apparent that I made a mistake)

If you want me to draw your whole body, or your hands, or god-forbid some *other* part of your body, I will try, but be fore-warned that I haven't really drawn anything but faces. In fact the links that I put up are about 70% of ALL the things I've ever drawn.

Also, even though they don't look like much, each one takes me 2-3 hours to draw, so I won't be able to pump these out very quickly if several people want one. 


**edit:** I woke up this morning to several requests, awesome! I'm going to try to get to everyone who has posted so far, but it will probably take a few days ( with real life getting in the way, and all) I'll start on these after work, or perhaps during lunch.

Also, feel free to make a request if you haven't already, the more interesting the picture is, the more likely I will make sure it gets drawn 


**edit2:** I just wanted to let everyone know I haven't forgotten/abandoned the thread, I know with the immediacy of the internet it gets annoying to wait for something that takes as long as this. I get off work in 2 and a half hours and I'll start the sketching marathon then.

Inquire within.,ranautricularia,52,8,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bsq9e/offer_i_will_look_over_your_survey_to_make_sure/,"Hi Redditors, I took a whole class (grad school) on survey development and testing. I have an eye for potential problems with surveys and have read more books than I care to admit about writing good surveys and good survey questions.

Please, before posting a survey here, if you're not on a huge deadline, can you fly it by me? A bad survey makes all collected data meaningless.

Think about it. In exchange, I demand only your unconditional love.

-----------------

**Top 5 Mistakes Made in Surveys**

1. Unclear meanings
&gt;* **You** know what it means. Will everyone else know what it means? Probably not!
&gt; * Ask yourself, what are *all* the possible ways people will interpret this question? Because chances are, they will. If you think ""my survey respondents are too smart to f- this question up"", just head over to youtube.com and look at a few comments.
&gt; * This includes: poor lead-in (the sentences before your actual question), insufficient definition of terms, no warning when the topic changes
2. Non-exhaustive answer choices, or repetitions
&gt; * e.g. ""0-10,000; 11,000-15,000; 16,000-20,000"". Leaves out 10,500
&gt; * versus ""0-10,000; 10,000-15,000; 15,000-20,000"". This has 10,000 and 15,000 twice. I wouldn't know which one to check!
&gt; * or ""male, female"" with no ""other"" - not everyone fits in neatly! *Always* include a ""neither"" or ""none of the above"" where it might make sense.
&gt; * This also includes assuming that everyone engages in some kind of task or buys some certain item. **Don't ever assume anything!** Because you *will* get the bisexual transgender Austrian from Madagascar who's never been on the internet before taking the survey.
3. Poor design/layout
&gt; * People read from top to bottom. If your definitions are below the answer boxes, people won't look at them. Explain *everything* before they get a chance to answer.
&gt; * Are the divisions between questions clear?
&gt; * Is it clear where they're supposed to answer and how?
4. Questions don't match answers
&gt; * e.g. ""How often?"" when answers are ""5, 6, 7"" -- what's the unit?
&gt; * This may include: insufficient units, inappropriate measures
&gt; * Try to answer every question with each possible answer to it - does it makes sense? Is that how you could see yourself answering that question?
&gt; * **Always** explain how your scale works. ""On a scale of 1-10"" isn't enough! Sometimes 1 is best, and sometimes 10. Say ""On a scale of 1-10, where 1 is never and 10 is always"" or whatever. 
&gt; * On the same note, *try to include units whenever possible*. ""Sometimes"" means different things to different people. It's always better to define what you mean, so instead of 'sometimes' put ""2-3 times per week"" or whatever.
5. Trying to keep it short at the expense of clarity
&gt; * What does ""male or female?"" or ""sex?"" mean? Just say it: ""What is your gender?"" People will be angrier the more time they spend wondering what you're asking, versus just reading a simple question.

**The most important thing ever**
&gt; For every question, ask yourself: ""what question am I trying to answer with this? How do I want to use the results?"". Your phrasing of the question will change depending on what you want to figure out. This is perhaps the single most important step in the survey process.",,False,,t5_2re6a,True,,,True,t3_bsq9e,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bsq9e/offer_i_will_look_over_your_survey_to_make_sure/,

It'd be neat if you had some familiarity with this brief bit o'text prior to posting in /r/Favors.  Right now, the spam filter has ratcheted itself up to ""turbo"" because, well, asking for favors is something that tends to stink of Internet scammer-hood.  So hopefully some careful adherence to this document will scale that back and this will remain the happy, healthy place it looks like it should be.

**1) What's a ""favor?""**

 - [The Oracle](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Afavor&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) defines a favor as ""an act of gracious kindness.""  /r/Favors, however, defines a favor as ""**Asking for something you can't do or granting something they can't do.**""  What you're looking for might be better handled elsewhere.

**2) What other resources are there to ask for or grant a favor?**

 - Well, there's Craigslist, obviously.  If your post would be better served by Craigslist, we'll ban it.  There's Freecycle, too, for those of you more interested in altruism.  If it's ""stuff"" you seek, Craigslist or Freecycle are the way to go.

**3) That's not a favor, that's stuff!  I want to give/get help with my/your homework!**

 - [Bam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/homeworkhelp) average-sized subreddit.  Yeah, it's tiny, but at least crosspost in there.

**4) What about relationship advice?**

- [Bam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/) Four times the eyeballs, much less cranky mods.

**5) Could you listen to my song...?**

 - Sure, but [these guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/) are probably better at it.

**6)...critique my poetry...?**

 - Again, [better forums.](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/)

**7)...send me letters/emails/IMs/smoke signals?**

 - Yes, but [also check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/)

**8) So you're just trying to drive everyone away.  Got it.**

 - Hardly!  Consider this just another favor - you're likely to get the best response from a group of people focused on freecycling/relationship advice/music making/whatever.  If you look, we haven't been banning much of that stuff.

**9) Whatever.  So why has my post about composing petrarchan sonnets been banned?  Huh?  Riddle me that, Batman!**

 - It hasn't.  Some posts go to purgatory where they sit for a couple hours.  Then they automagically emerge, untouched and unscathed.  You can afford to wait a couple hours, can't you?  Sometimes we have to go and fish them out ourselves.  We'll get to it, I promise, just be patient.  *No Patience?*  See over there on the right, where it says ""MODERATORS"" and has three names?  Read a little further - see that `""message the moderators""`in little tiny text?  **CLICK ON THAT.**  Vwa.

**10) Well, you totally banned my Demonoid invite request.**

 - Damn skippy.  Torrent request swaps go in the **Official Invite Swap Thread,** plainly visible in the sidebar.  Did you post a whole new silly submission just to score an invite to Waffles?  Then you deserved the banhammer, doofus.  Just for the record, however, I didn't ban you - I just refused to rescue your post from purgatory.  Post in the official thread like everyone else. **Bear in mind that most private trackers frown on giving out invites to people you don't know.**  If they ban you for what you do on here, don't cry to me about it.  Your argument is with THEIR terms of service, not mine.

**11) I hate your color scheme.**

 - And I hate your shoes.  Way to be passive-aggressive.

**12) Why are you talking to yourself?**

Her [offer of sending a finals care package](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/1dd550/offera_finals_care_package_for_a_college_student/) to a student was incredible and just reading the post alone warmed my heart to see someone care enough to brighten a stranger's stressful week.

This has been a terrible semester, as posted in my response to the offer, but today has been an incredibly difficult day being what would have been celebrated as two years together and one year engaged. The timing of receiving this package could not have been anymore perfect, opening it last night as I began to feel rather sad and alone.

/u/FeatofClay, your kindness to a stranger really brightened up my finals week, and even as I type this I am fighting back some tears.

So many of you are so talented at design that I thought I would ask here first.  My budget for this is US$150.,istara,56,7,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/cmsid/paid_request_amateur_novelist_wants_to_commission/,"I wrote my first novel last year and plan to self-publish it via CreateSpace.  I would like to have custom artwork for the cover, though I realise my budget may be too low.

Unfortunately, CreateSpace demands that:

&gt;Our member agreement requires that you own or have obtained all rights to any content you deliver to us.

and I realise this may put some people off.  I would personally much rather licence the artwork from the artist than ""own"" it.  However I would be totally happy for you to use it however you wanted (eg publish it in your portfolio etc), and if I could licence/revert/give it back to you somehow later on, then I'd be happy to do this.

I can discuss the book in more detail with anyone who is seriously interested (message me) but broadly speaking it's a light mystery adventure thriller surrounding a grandfather clock with a hidden secret, and much of it is set in Bavaria in winter, in the 1970s.  Holly is a particularly relevant theme.

EDIT:  thank you everyone for the responses!  And sorry for my delay, I'm in a different timezone here so I just woke up.  I will reply to you all individually and take a look at everyone's links, however I'm on an inter-state trip today so only have my iPhone until this evening - so please excuse further delays in replying to you all.  I have no idea how I'll be able to decide, I was only expecting a couple of replies!  Thanks ;)

EDIT 2:  thanks again for your patience!  I think I've managed to message everyone who expressed interest.  I've sent most of you the same blurb so if you already sent me a link then just ignore that bit.  Choosing is going to be the hardest thing in the world.  Seriously, everyone's stuff is just so professional.  It's my hope that this catches on, so that the many other struggling writers in /r/writing and elsewhere may also think to employ some of your talents later on.

Sorry, just got so many in a day.  But, I'll be doing another one of these soon :3

Hey there Reddit, hows life going?  Well, I'm here, an art student who hasn't really even touched a pencil in a few months since holiday break.  In order for me to practice, and not end up failing out of school, I'd like to get as many of your request in before January 9th~! 

So, if you have a request for anything to be drawn for you, hit me up and I she what I can do :3  


*EDIT* I've never had this many replies!  WOW!  I'm traveling all day tomorrow on the train/bus, so I should be able to get a good chunk done.  Just so everyone knows, I'm a traditional, not digital artist, so my media is usually pen and watercolor.  

*EDIT* (Jan-1st-2012)  I'm on a bus!  WITH INTERNET!  Well, anyway, I thought I would be able to draw some more work up for you guys, but it's way to windy for a steady pencil.  So once I get to union station for my layover I'll have 3 hours to work~! :3

My team is currently in possession of the bag, and one of the members of the other team is going out of town for the holidays. Since I have a key to this guy's house, we want to wallpaper his bedroom in blue Dorito bags.

**HOWEVER**, my team consists of myself and one friend, and we're confident that there is no way we can consume that many dorito bags worth of chips in this short amount of time. My request to you, reddit, is to send me your empty bags instead of throwing them away.

If you want in, we will provide you with pics of the whole shebang, for hilarity's sake. 

We, the humble pranksters, thank you.

1319410754.0,43,self.Favors,lmgtz,"[MOD] /r/Favors' Official Rules, October 23, 2011",Anomander,63,20,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/lmgtz/mod_rfavors_official_rules_october_23_2011/,"**/r/Favors exists as a place for redditors to offer and ask neighborly favors of the community.** As the curators of what is essentially a regulated free-trade zone for generosity, we feel it is important to regularly re-assess the methods by which we preserve this community and the standards by which we assess its content.  The rules value the health of /r/favors first, the health of the Reddit community second and the satisfaction of the individual redder third. Any changes to these rules will reflect these same core values. The modship of /r/favors was elected by popular vote with the mandate to operate it in the common interest. 

**How we moderate /r/favors**

The overwhelming majority of the work performed by the /r/favors mods involves interacting with the filter. More often than not, posts to /r/favors land in the filter first. Once there, it is up to us to decide whether we consider the post to be appropriate to /r/favors. Sheer luck will occasionally play a role in allowing posts to bypass the filter. Everybody wins if these posts are appropriate. If they are not, the moderation team is not always going to remove a post, particularly if it has points and comments, but this is not a guarantee of immunity for popular but rule-breaking posts. *We recognize that this is a less-than-ideal system* but we also recognize that Reddit offers a less-than-ideal architecture for dealing with the problem. Realistically speaking, it's the best we can do.  If you are curious why we do not set rules and allow user voting to care for the health of the frontpage, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/lfvkj/mod_hey_rfavorites_your_mod_team_has_rewritten/c2sduse) is a lengthy and detailed explanation using art requests as a specific example.  

A post is judged on many criteria. These criteria are different for requests and offers. Offers are granted more latitude - someone offering to draw something, for example, is demonstrably more altruistic than someone wanting something drawn. If a post is offering something with no glaring strings attached or blatant problems, it gets through. While holding relatively strict criteria to people who want things seems reasonable to prevent abuse, we have no reason to prevent someone from giving something away. *Posts that are looking for trades or sales are held to the [REQUEST] standards, because the recipient is asked to risk something of their own*.

**Please tag posts appropriately.**  The team doesn't necessarily ban un-tagged posts, but appropriate tags help everyone and properly tagged posts have been consistently more successful thus far. 

**Requests are judged by the following criteria:**    

 * **No financial requests.** The community has repeatedly asked that we keep all ""panhandling"" requests out, no exceptions, regardless of content. This includes charity drives, donations, ""good causes"" and any and all ""a-thons."" Our readership enjoys being generous, but loathes assessing whether someone is worthy of their generosity - therefore, that task falls to the moderators. As we have the exact same tools to judge trustworthiness as you do, we refuse to do so. *Since we can't judge who is ""worthy"" and who is not, we do not judge at all*.  This rule includes requests for gifts, cards, knick-knacks, and/or general swag.      
 * **We do not do custom art or design work on request.** The community has repeatedly chosen to disallow all forms of ""please draw me a thing."" This extends to logos, photoshop, photo restoration, picture coloring, video editing, and design services of any kind. We recommend [/r/picrequests](http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests) instead.  The team permitted requests such as this for a weekend over a year ago and within 72 hours ""draw me a thing"" requests dominated the front page. We serve the community - and while the thing you want drawn is of keen interest to you, it is of near-zero interest to the community.  This does not exclude offers of custom art of design, and the /r/favors community strongly encourages such posts.  Logos for *thriving* reddit communities are the only art request not banned under this rule.    
 * **We do not pad your numbers.** /r/favors is not interested in rigging contests, nor do we consider padding numbers, providing viewers, adding followers, Facebook ""likes,"" Google+ ""+1""s, or any sort of attention exchange to be a ""favor"" per se.  Post elsewhere and allow your content to stand for itself.  [/r/shamelessplug](http://www.reddit.com/r/shamelessplug) may serve your needs instead, be sure to check their rules before posting.  
 * **Referrals and invites are out.** Referrals, invites, and the like all have their own places on reddit. Those places can be found in our sidebar.    
 * **Titles must be honest, and include any relevant price information.** A good example of a dishonest post is one titled ""[OFFER] Free Webdesign\*"" with ""\*if you sign up for my hosting service"" in the body. Posts that suggest one thing in the title and something else entirely in the content are removed. We contact the OP in marginal cases and suggest they try again with greater clarity.  Further, prices offered in trades/work for hire arrangements must be stated in the title.  ""Am willing to pay"" seems to have become ""I'll pay if you ask, but want it for free"". We want our artists to be able to decide if a request is offering enough to make it worth their time to bid. We further wish for any negotiations that begin at /r/favors stay as transparent as possible.    
 * **No ""buy me a NEW game"" requests.** Reddit has [/r/gameswap](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap), which has enacted a good system to keep scammy shit to a minimum. We don't, and don't have the manpower to set one up and manage everything else /r/favors related. We wish to note, however, the ""new"" aspect of this request: Moderator Anomander has given away CD keys to most of his old, now unplayed, games here to folks requesting them. We propose that only games over four years old are legit to request, because the long-average update/expansion cycle is three years long. A four-year-old game is more likely to be sitting unplayed somewhere than Minecraft is.    
 * **No ditch-digging.** Requests for others to perform tasks that require no skill, knowledge or experience beyond the ability to log onto Reddit are not considered to be a ""favor."" If your task could be performed by Amazon's Mechanical Turk service or a studious application of Google, you are not looking for neighborly help, you're looking for free labor. This includes vectorization of images, finding long-lost reddit posts, letter-writing campaigns, answering easily google-able questions, etc.    

There is a large grey area not specifically covered by the above formal rules that may still pose the community problems.  

 * **Obvious ""joke"" posts get removed.** ""[REQUEST]: Harem,"" for instance. Or ""[Offer]: Meaning of life""; body text is just ""42"". These posts do not contribute anything meaningful. Contrast this to the chap offering nicknames, which while silly and somewhat inane, at least led to some really amusing conversations.     
 * **Posts not containing a concrete favor or offer get pulled.** ""[Request] I has a sad, make me feel better"" are either better suited to any number of ""discussion"" communities, or they're thinly veiled panhandling requests (""send me messages to make me feel better, here's my steam ID"").    
 * **We also judge posts by the account posting them.** /r/favors exists as a place for redditors to do and ask for awesome stuff from each other. We require a clear demonstration that an account is a redditor first, and asking for things second. An account with high karma and age has more to lose and is more vulnerable to naming and shaming. New accounts with little activity are far more likely to be looking for a handout and far less likely to be participating in the community. We are far more likely to bend the rules for an account over 100 days old. New accounts with over 1000 karma are considered to be active contributors. Old accounts with no (or questionable) use may also be questioned.
 * **Surveys are still permitted, but with conditions.**  The survey cannot result in financial gain for the OP or potential harm to users.  This will be assessed on a per-complaint basis. 

 **Exemptions are never granted.** We're not judging you as a poster, we're judging the content of your post.

 **Please report problem content.**  We try our best, we really do.  Sometimes we miss stuff.  If you catch something we miss, report it.  If you report something, it's super awesome to *also* [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Favors) and let us know about the reported post and why it's problematic.  

 **These rules are not letter-of-the-law, but to illustrate the spirit of our moderation and provide guidance on marginal cases.** Just because a specific thing is unmentioned does not exempt it, nor does specific mention preclude a mod exemption.  Our core values are: /r/favors first, reddit second, individual redditors third.  We will use our best judgement to curate the community with these values to guide us.  Further, /r/favors is a representative democracy: you elected us as moderators to perform the tasks and enact the changes we feel are essential to its management.  If you are dissatisfied, we invite you to run for election when nominations open next.

And the idea was that maybe we could do something awesome like getting a box all around the world. I was thinking that maybe we could document the box's travel. The general idea is that I will mail the box to someone, and then they will mail it to someone else and then continue this trend until the box comes back to me. Each time you get the box, it'll look different (the previous holder can draw on it/ use stickers/ and obviously will have stamps) and you can take a picture of you with the box. 



  Before I start the project I want to know how many people will be participating and where in the world they are. That way I know how big a box to use and I can make a travel plan for the box. 

   If you want to participate in this, just voice off your intent and location in the comments. After I get a reasonable number of folks, I'll tell you who will be mailing you and you can give them your address (unless you'd rather I do the address giving..then we can make it so that you pm me and I contact them). 


* Offer to send you a box and participate in a fun project.
* Request is that you write/draw something interesting on the box and mail it to the next holder. You can also take a photo of you and the box when it arrives, but I understand that some people might not be comfortable doing that..so that part is optional.  



EDIT: Another idea is that,  the box will have a twitter account that we'll share with the holders. And whoever gets the box, can update the twitter account (and post the picture there)! How does that sound?

EDIT 2: Here is the locations that we have at the moment. I will add more as it goes and if I've missed you, just pm me.

EDIT 3: **Okay, So I think we should be able to work in doubles (once in outgoing from states and once when coming back) but any more doesn't make sense. And we seriously need more out of U.S/international holders.  **

*[Goingnorthwest's idea](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/c6gbj/requestoffer_box_around_the_world/c0qfqd2) of using a notebook is most brilliant (and much tidier than notecards). I also happen to have a leather-bound lying around, so we shall use this. I'm going to go get the box tomorrow!  I will write the twitter account info on the journal. So you can update when you get it. :)*

EDIT 4: Okay folks, we are nearing the 50 mark. We need to make the next [4] count!  (One page front and back per destination.. however we could squeeze more in, if we only front/back, but I think that's kind of too limiting). 

EDIT 5:  Alright, So as I map this thing.. here are a few things I need to point out, we have considerably too many folks in the mainland USA  (sorry guys!). I might have to cut a few off, so that postage isn't ridiculous for the rest of the folks. I desperately need people in mainland Asia and Africa (however, the flight path can be modified to accommodate for the latter..not so for the earlier one..).

1364243803.0,43,self.Favors,1azuqr,[offer] Will build a free responsive website for your restaurant.,Hannachomp,51,8,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/1azuqr/offer_will_build_a_free_responsive_website_for/,"**About me:**
 
*Design:* I'm a graphic designer in my final semester at a design school. Last summer, I interned at a startup that actually makes responsive websites for businesses (although I didn't actually code them there). I already have a job offer as a junior interaction designer but still interviewing. Since my portfolio has personal contact information on it, if you want to see my portfolio, feel free to pm me.

*Coding:* I self taught myself html/css about 7 years ago. I can add limited javascript to the website. If you want something a little more fancy, we can discuss it but I can't guarantee I can do it 

*Illustration:* I also have a background in illustration. So if you wanted a more illustrative website, I can certainly work with that.


**Why I'm offering this for free:** 

For the last half of this semester one of my projects is to create a responsive website for a restaurant. I figured I might as well see if anyone wants to work with me to create a real one. That way I can both help someone who needs a website and create something that lives in the real world.

**Who you should be:** 

Someone who owns a small restaurant. 

You can have a website already or have none at all. 

In the next few months you weren't already planning on contacting someone for a new website or any website in general or you were just planning on letting your sister's high school kid who knows some html to make it. *I don't want this job to take away from another designer.*

You aren't in a hurry. This will be probably be done in early May.

Willing to keep in contact with me. So I can create something that will work with both of us. 

Own some sort of digital camera or knows someone with a camera or have nice large photographs I can use for the website.

**What this will be:**

A website that will be responsive restaurant website. It'll be simple and up to par with many websites already out there: with history about me/landing page/menu/location etc. I will not implement an online ordering system. This will be built completely from scratch. It will not be template based, I will not use bootstrap or drupal.

I can help you get a domain name and such if you need me to and help implement it. Or I can just give you all the files for you to do it yourself. I will help you change small things on the website in the beginning until you get use to it. I will not completely revamp the website later.

If you do not have any branding (logos/colours/etc) we can work together to build something simple. However, as I'm more of an interaction/web designer, that's not my forte. Therefore, if you didn't have any branding, I will help you change it later after my original placeholder brand.

If you do not keep in contact with me I'll still move on with the project. If you do not provide me with photos I will just use stock images. If you do not provide me with examples of what you're expecting, I will not be able to read your mind. 

If the finished product is not up to your satisfaction you do not need to actually use the website. However, I will still use it in my portfolio.

The design and development will be completely free. I will *not* put ""Made by Hannachomp"" or something similar on the site. I do not expect anything from you except constant feedback and information and you can later use the website as you wish. 

The only thing I will be doing is linking to your site from my portfolio.

I will not pay for your domain and hosting.

I'm only making one site. It won't be a first come first serve basis. I want to work with someone who will be able to work with me. I expect to spend around 80-100 hours of work time creating this.",,False,,t5_2re6a,1364275219.0,,,True,t3_1azuqr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/1azuqr/offer_will_build_a_free_responsive_website_for/,

I'm looking for people who would be willing to call me during the next few days and have a conversation (details inside) - USA,JJTheJetPlane5657,45,2,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/17e67d/request_i_want_to_break_the_extreme_anxiety_i/,"Hey, all! 

As I said, I have a really bad hang up about talking to people on the phone. To the point where if I get a call from an unknown number I'll just stare at my phone until it stops ringing. And then I experience a lot of anxiety about going to check the voicemail. It's really annoying, and I'd like to break this habit. 

I'm looking for some people to call me between certain hours (PM me and I'll give you a time-range) and just have a short conversation with me. I'd prefer if you have something to say, tell me a story or a little bit about yourself or something to get the ball rolling. And.. Well.. That's really about it! 

Some other details: Since I don't want to give my phone number out to internet strangers (although I'm sure you're nice people), the number I will be giving you is a Google Voice number that I can access on my cell phone. 

The next thing I want to touch on is timing. We're all busy people who have work and class and such to go to, so when we PM we'll probably set up a timeframe of a couple of hours on a certain day (or range of days) that you could call me. This way we can work out a time that works for both of us, I can make sure no two people are going to call me at the same time, but it still keeps a certain element of surprise so I can help break my anxiety.

Also, I live in the north-eastern US. Make sure that won't get you any long distance charges! I think everyone in the US should be okay, but just double check to be sure. 

Thanks for your help!

1294433635.0,44,self.Favors,ey3zv,[request/offer] I'd like to be something different for a day,dick122,46,2,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/ey3zv/requestoffer_id_like_to_be_something_different/,"I'm going to xpost this elsewhere later to cast my net as wide as I can, but I would like to be something else for at least a day. I’m not overly particular regarding what that ‘something else’ is; but would prefer it be something I’ve yet to try, something that won’t endanger my life or way of living and something that won’t get anybody into any trouble. This will probably be difficult to arrange since Redditors are scarce in my area but I’d like to at least give it a shot.

What I’m proposing is that somebody let me shadow them at their place of work for a day. I’ll expect no compensation; the experience will be my reward. If you build houses for a living, I can act as an apprentice-of-sorts. If you’re a personal assistant, I’ll help you fetch coffee or do whatever it is that personal assistants do. I’m not afraid of good, honest work so if your profession requires a rake or shovel I’d be more than happy to pitch in.

Somebody is going to say: “why don’t you just volunteer for a day?” I love volunteer work but what I’m looking for is something entirely different. Maybe it’ll inspire me to seek a new career. Maybe it will give me some insight into what’s involved in other professions. I’m sure I’ll gain new respect for whatever it is I end up doing.

In return, if you’re interested, you can tag along with me for a day. Right now I work for a steel company. I think I’ve mentioned this over a dozen times in various comments. I’m called a “purchasing agent” which is exactly what it sounds like: I purchase materials. I sit in a dingy office all day sifting through drawings, sorting through materials our guys require, pricing those materials out and purchasing them. That’s it. Well that and a bunch of other stuff. If that sounds exciting to you, I’m sorry. Still, you’d be more than welcome to spend a day with me. I’m sure you'll walk away having learned something.

I’m serious. This is something I’d really like to do. Maybe there are others who might be interested in trying this out as well. Even if it doesn’t pan out for me I’d love to hear if it worked out for somebody else. Consider it something like a “Bring a Redditor to Work Day”. If this post goes nowhere I'll try reposting early next week.

**tl;dr:** I’d like to shadow somebody at their place of work for a day and offer them the same opportunity in return. I’m just looking for some new experiences and a way to break the monotony of my day-to-day life.

If you name a game with a clear style of music, preferably retroish, but not necessarily such, and give me a somewhat detailed description of your personality (or the personality of whomever's theme you'd like to hear), I will write you a theme song!

I don't know if I'll be able to get to everyone, but I will most definitely select one person at the very least for whom I will write a tune and send to them in the form of an mp3.

One of my favorite subjects is soil science. I've collected soil for about 3 years now, so I have samples from areas I've visited since then, but my travels rarely take me as far as the West Coast or further up than Pennsylvania. (I've also never visited Florida, something people find unbelievable.) I always mention this to my friends who travel but it's hard to remember to get a soil sample when you're enjoying a vacation.

If you're willing to send me some soil:

* it can be in a regular Ziplock sandwich size bag, doesn't have to be a lot
* from an undisturbed area if possible
* not potting soil, mulch, etc.
* labeled as to your location (as specific as the city)
* include pertinent info for tests (near river, in the middle of a corn field, etc.)

You don't have to be from any glamorous place, soil is interesting no matter what. I like showing my students the differences in color, texture, composition - we use the information (state, what's nearby, etc.) to figure out why it's different from other soil. We also test the pH, and N, P, K.  

I also plan to make a map with spaces for each state and fill them in with the soil I have from each state.

If you're interested in sending me some, I can send you my work address. The zip is 37064 for those wondering about shipping costs.

I am in Denver until Tuesday when my flight leaves. I had originally planned on staying with a friend, however she can no longer host me. 

My name is Edge, I'm 23, male, clean cut, and did not budget for hotels or hostels. Thus I have come to the good people of Reddit to request help.

I'm currently downtown at Leela cafe, I'll happily exchange housework, prepare meals etc. For a couch to crash on. If it can only be for one night that would be very helpful. I have a ride to the airport on Tuesday and food with me to eat, so the only thing I am in need of is a place to rest my head.

If you live or know someone in Denver that would be willing to aid a stranded traveler, I would greatly appreciate it.

If not, I can call and ask for a relative to pay for a hotel or hostel, I'd just really rather not. Besides, in my previous travels, these types of situations were how I met some very interesting friends, so I'm quite excited to see what fate has in store.



TL;DR I need a couch to crash on in Denver until Tuesday when my flight leaves out.

I have a favour to ask. I'm trying to work on my American accent and I need to know if I'm doing anything wrong. 

Could you guys listen to this minute-long recording of me and tell me if I could pass as an American? And if you notice any words I'm pronouncing incorrectly, if you could let me know which ones that that'd be great as well. I'm reading from Harry Potter to make it less boring for you :P

So here's the recording: http://chirb.it/mzsr7K

And the text:
&gt;Chapter One: The Boy Who Lived

&gt;Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive, were proud to say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold with such nonsense. 

&gt;Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, although he did have a very large moustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences, spying on the neighbours. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion, there was no finer boy anywhere.

&gt;The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister but they hadn't met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have a sister because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as unDursleyish as it was possible to be.

the bill comes and it was for over $1000.00
my dad calls best buy, expecting it to be an

he had been signed up for a contract. He
was also told that we had went over the

My dad immediately returns to best buy to
speak with the manager and explains
everything. The manager apologized for the
employee lying to my dad, refunded him
for the package, and promised to ""take care
of everything"".
the NEXT month the bill comes out to
$3000.00 for late fees and other fees.
Verizon now tries to contact the manager of

Any kind soul that can help me please leave a comment and I'll contact you through pm and send you my resume so you have something to work with. The interview is for a quality assurance engineer position so anyone working in a related field would be especially helpful. I can't afford to compensate you but if I do land the job, I'd be so happy to send some scratch your way for helping me out. Thanks!

Edit: ozuri was extremely helpful. A big thank you to him.

Edit2: Thank you to bingosherlock and UKDude20 for even offering but I didn't have a chance to speak with them. I wish I had thought of this idea sooner. The interview went very well! One of the managers spoke as if I already got the job but they haven't made an offer yet.

Edit3: I sent a quick thank you email and now I'm just waiting for a call. Monday can't come soon enough. I'll be sure to update this as soon as I know.

Edit4: It's Wednesday night and I haven't heard back so I'm assuming the worst. No relevant experience :(. I'm not discouraged, just gotta suck it up and do some internships for a while I suppose.

I swiped my card at the pump, removed the nozzle, pressed the regular unleaded fuel button (you know, the usual routine), and watched as nothing came out.  I pressed the unleaded button again with the same result.  At this time, I put the nozzle back on its holder and looked at the machine in a puzzled manner.  The guy at the pump next to me hollered over that he couldn't get the pump that I was on to work either.  Deciding to give it one more try, I removed the nozzle and laid into the unleaded button.  Boom!  Gasoline flowed. 

When I got my receipt, I noticed that the credit card that was on it did not belong to me.  Rather, it belonged to a James A. Helicke.  I went into the Shell station to see if they could reverse the charges on James' card and put them on mine.  The attendant informed me that he could not do this without the physical presence of James' card, and since James had departed, I was out of luck.

At this point, the other attendant mentioned that he thought that he had overheard James say that he was in from New Jersey on a fishing trip.

tl;dr: James A. Helicke (possibly from New Jersey) accidentally paid for my gas today in Zanesville, Ohio.  I would like to write him a check so that everyone is good on the transaction.

UPDATE:  PirateChurch deserves all the credit/upvotes/karma for the find.  He was able to provide accurate contact information for James and James will be getting his check in the mail tomorrow (well, I will be sending it out tomorrow).  James wanted me to thank everyone involved in the process for the effort and for restoring some of his faith in humanity.  I would like to thank everyone involved on reddit for being keen detectives, helpful and kind people, and at times skeptical of my intent, for that is important as well.

I like to make [subreddit logos](http://i.imgur.com/R0RO6.png).  I don't particularly need money though.  So I'm going to try a little experiment.

Here's the deal:  I'll make you a subreddit logo if you donate $5 to someone who actually needs in in [/r/assistance](http://www.reddit.com/r/assistance).

Here's how this works:

1. Post a comment here of the subreddit you'd like a logo for, and perhaps some ideas for it.
2. Wait for me to reply and confirm that I can actually do it (which depends on both my time, ability, and interest;  I won't be able to do everything).
3. Donate $5 to a redditor who actually needs the money.  Look in [/r/assistance](http://www.reddit.com/r/assistance) for lots of people who need financial help.
4. Have the person you donated to send me a PM saying they got the money from you (and have them mention your username so I know who it's from) so I know they got it.
5. I'll make and post your subreddit logo.

I'll have to see how well this works out...  Since you're not giving money to me, I have no ability to offer refunds, so satisfaction is absolutely NOT guaranteed;  if that's a problem, please don't bother to apply.

Just post your spray request if you still want one, and I'll make it for you when I'm at my computer.

******

[Example of a fading spray.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=So_AjBQYEMY)

If you want a fading spray made, post your ""close-up"" image and your ""distant"" image as a reply. You can also have multiple images in a fading spray that appear based on the distance; just tell me the order you want them in from close to far.

There are also more advanced options one could make with these sprays. For instance, if you want to customize it a bit more, tell me what distance you want the fading to start. (I'd venture to say that the spray in the video has a distance of 2; a distance of 1 would be half that and a distance of 3 would be double.)

Also note that while I am decent with Photoshop and can do some basic touchups to pictures (such as background transparency and resizing), it would be a lot faster if you had the pictures fully ready when submitting them.

Also also note that resizing the pictures is usually inevitable, since the sprays have to have dimension that are a power of 2. If you're worried about losing detail in the spray, or it looks like it has a lot of whitespace, resize it to ~512x512 so that it looks good to you before submitting; however, I can usually take care of that.

Finally, I don't mind making NSFW sprays, but I will have sole discretion regarding whether to make it or not.

**EDIT:** To install the sprays, extract them to Steam/steamapps/&lt;username&gt;/[team fortress 2|counter-strike source]/[tf|cstrike]/materials/VGUI/logos, and then select the new spray from your list. Obviously this is for CS/TF2, since those are the games that I mostly play, but other games should have a similar setup.

**Edit2:** Right now, I'm just using the ""closest"" fade settings. For an idea of ""where"" the fading occurs, looky over [here](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/1292945/sprays/example.jpg). Each distance increase doubles that length. The shaded area is where fading happens, and the ""selected"" area is where the ""close"" spray appears.

~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Question 15 had 2 correct answers and had the option to select both.  The percentages here are of how many picked which one, but don't exactly accurately represent a strict ""Who picked the right answer"" because the wrong answer is to also just select one of them.  Anyways, yeah. 

I know that you guys are probably gonna want to debate the answers.  I will try to respond as much as I can, but until this week is over I'm still swamped with a project.  Keep this in mind, though: If I asked a question wrong or whatever then this is for a grade and I'll get docked on it.  The only one that I'm really skeptical about is Question 18 because after second guessing myself about 100 times I'm not entirely sure the answer that I was looking for isn't a phrasal verb too, so.  Just to keep you guys from debating on that one, anyway.

I have a ton - I was a voracious reader as a kid. If you tell me your kid's age, gender, reading level, and any particular type of book he/she likes, I can probably find something to send to you. Also, if you want it to be a gift and not look used, let me know that, too, as some of my books are clearly worn in.

EDIT: I love the response to this! Young readers make me happy. Definitely keep encouraging this in your kids/siblings/friends.

I'm going to catalog all the books I have to give away. I'll start now, and keep adding:

* ~~**Everyone Else's Parents Said Yes** by Paula Danziger - Funny book about a sixth grade boy named Matthew Martin planning his birthday party. The first of many to feature Matthew, a funny kid who goes out of his way to annoy girls.~~

* ~~**Sixth Grade Can Really Kill You** by Barthe DeClements - A somewhat more serious book about a girl who always gets into trouble and might have to stay back a grade in school.~~

* ~~**Witch Week** by Diana Wynne Jones - Fun magical realism story about students who discover they're actual witches -- but witches are still being burned at the stake.~~

* **The Chronicles of Chrestomanci: Volume I** by Diana Wynne Jones - 600 page volume combining two novels, Charmed Life and The Lives of Christopher Chant. A magical fantasy taking place in parallel universes.

* **Crash** by Jerry Spinelli - Winner of multiples awards, this is the story of a seventh-grade football star who regularly picks on his nerdy neighbor.

* **Johnny's in the Basement** by Louis Sachar - Probably my least favorite by Sachar, but that doesn't say much. About a boy dealing with his parents declaring that since he's eleven, it's time for him to grow up.

* ~~**Island of the Aunts** by Eva Ibbotson - Great fantasy story about a boy and a girl who are kidnapped and brought to an island to eventually become caretakers for the odd creatures who live there. Winner of various awards.~~

* ~~**The Secret of Platform 13** by Eva Ibbotson - Another great fantasy by Ibbotson about an underground kingdom beneath London's King's Cross Station.~~

* **Mom, You're Fired!** by Nancy K. Robinson - Story about a girl who finds her mother really embarrassing. Probably for younger readers, age 9 maximum. 

* ~~**The Last of the Really Great Whangdoodles** by Julie Andrews - A clever fantasy quest about kids and a wacky professor who takes them to a magical world.~~

* **Angus, Thongs, and Full-Frontal Snogging** by Louise Rennison - Funny first book in a series about a boy-crazy girl and her wacky life. Not for elementary school kids. Winner of the Printz Award for Young Adult Literature.

* **Dear America: A Journey to the New World** - Historical fiction hardcover about a girl traveling on the Mayflower in 1620.

* **Dear America: So Far From Home** - Historical fiction hardcover about an Irish textile mill worker in 1847.

* **The Moves Make the Man** by Bruce Brooks - A sports-themed novel about a runaway and playing basketball. Probably for the middle school and up set. Newbery Honor book.

* **The Swiss Family Robinson** by Johann Wyss - I actually never read this one, but it's a classic about a family shipwrecked on a tropical island.

* **An Alex Rider Adventure: Point Blank** by Anthony Horowitz - The story of a 14-year-old spy investigating mysterious deaths at a prep school. I loved all of the books that I read in this series.

* **Artemis Fowl: The Eternity Code** by Eoin Colfer – Book 3 in the fantasy series about an evil genius boy and his problems with the fairy world.

* **Artemis Fowl: The Opal Deception** by Eoin Colfer – Book 4 in the fantasy series about an evil genius boy and his problems with the fairy world.

* **13** by a variety of famous children’s authors – Hardcover in great condition that includes 13 different stories that “capture the agony and ecstasy of being thirteen.” Great gift for a 13th birthday.

* ~~**Eerie Indiana: The Dollhouse that Time Forgot** by Mike Ford – Creepy story about a bizarre dollhouse that seems to be affecting real life. Despite the title, it’s not just for girls, and it scared me as a kid.~~

* **Bloomability** by Sharon Creech – Story of a 13-year-old’s coming of age as she moves to Europe with her aunt and uncle.

* ~~**Chasing Redbird** by Sharon Creech - Beautiful, moving story about a girl moving on after deaths in the family.~~


* **Absolutely Normal Chaos** by Sharon Creech - Interesting story written as a girl's diary about the odd experiences she has over the summer.

* **The Suitcase Kid** by Jacqueline Wilson – Book about life for a girl with divorced parents and two new stepfamilies. I’ll send this with a tiny rabbit stuffed animal that I bought when I read the book because the girl in the story had one. If your kid is going through something like this, it might be helpful, and I’ll even include a note about my own stepfamily experience.

* **Childhood of Famous Americans: Ronald Reagan, Young Leader** by Montrew Dunham – Biography of Ronald Reagan focusing on his childhood.

* **Childhood of Famous Americans: Walt Disney, Young Movie Maker** by Marie Hammontree – Biography of Walt Disney focusing on his childhood. I loved this book, and it’d be great if your kid liked or is going to Disney World, or wants to make movies.

* **Childhood of Famous Americans: Teddy Roosevelt, Young Rough Rider** by Edd Winfield Parks – Biography of Teddy Roosevelt focusing on his childhood.

* **Childhood of Famous Americans: John F. Kennedy, America’s Youngest President** by Lucy Post Frisbee – Biography of JFK focusing on his childhood.

* **Joshua T. Bates in Trouble Again** by Susan Shreve – Book about a boy who is always getting into trouble and had to repeat the third grade. Now he’s been promoted to fourth, but he has problems with a bully. There are a few more in this series that I may have.

* **The Gypsy Game** by Zilpha Keatley Snyder – Story about kids who pretend to be Gypsies, and then weird things start happening in real life. I don’t have The Egyptian Game, but this is its sequel, and in my view, a great book that’s somewhat better than this one.

* **Yolanda’s Genius** by Carol Fenner – I don’t remember this Newbery Honor book. It’s about a tough black girl who thinks her little brother is a musical genius.

* ~~**Pony Pals** by Jeanne Betancourt – This is a series about girls who have and/or take care of ponies. Good for animal lovers ages 6-10. I’ll send however many books I find, probably about 3, along with “Your A-Z Guide to Horses &amp; Ponies” and “Pony Pals Planner” accompanying books.~~

I was cleaning out my room at my mom's house this weekend and found myself with an excess of Pokemon cards. Now- there's a bunch I'll probably want to keep just for sentimental value (lol), but there's also a ton that I don't really need. They span from the original 150 to those released with Ruby/Sapphire. 

I'm a poor college student, so I can't really afford to be sending out a million envelopes with Pokemon cards to strangers from the internet. However, the first ten to respond to this thread with a quick drawing of their favorite Pokemon done in MS Paint (however shitty) will receive an envelope sometime after the start of May with an undetermined number of random Pokemon cards. 

So ten lucky redditors in total will get random Pokemon cards; I can't guarantee them going out any sooner than May 5 because it's finals season. If you do a hand-drawn image of your favorite Pokemon, I'll throw in some sort of extra surprise. D: 

Also. If anybody has any ideas what to do with the rest of them, please let me know. :( I was thinking of selling them to make a quick buck, but I've never sold anything online and I have no idea how/where to start. 


Edit: We have our ten! Sorry for anyone else who wanted to participate. :( If you made pics, still post them, MS Paint drawings are always fun to look at. Maybe later on after a few more paychecks I'll decide to send out more; then you'll be top of the list. :)

Here's the deal: I'm looking to replace a yellow NPR mug that my friend had received several years ago because she volunteered at her local NPR station in Chicago (WBEZ). She said she really liked it, but accidentally dropped and broke it one day. I'm trying to surprise her for her birthday, so I can't offer a ton of information beyond what she already told me. Here's what I know: 

* It was specifically an NPR mug (not WBEZ specific)
* It was yellow
* It was either ""vintage""-y, or ""retro"" looking, not sure which word she used
* I'm not sure if the mugs NPR gives out as 'Thank you' gifts for volunteers are different from the ones they give out to people that donate money, but if they are, this would be of the 'volunteer' variety.
* It would've been given out at the very least 4 years ago, but possibly longer ago than that. Maybe even as many as 10-15 years ago.

I've looked everywhere on the internet for a cup that matches that description, but to no avail. If any one of you could help me locate one I would be very grateful. Also, I'll gladly pay for the mug and any shipping/inconvenience costs associated with finding it and getting it to me in Austin, Texas. 

Even if you have a picture of a yellow NPR mug that might be the one I'm looking for, I would appreciate it greatly if you PM'd me or posted in the comments. Right now I'm just going on her vague description and don't have much to work with. 

Please and thank you so much to anybody who read all this and/or is willing to check their cupboards or bug their NPR-volunteering-friends.

I recently inherited my grandfathers house, and when I moved in I found five boxes tucked neatly away in a back corner of the attic.

Inside of those boxes was (what appeared to be) every issue of playboy, hustler, and penthouse from the early 70's to 2002, random earlier years, and random other magazines. most still in their original sealed plastic bags.

While I would love to hang on to them... for, eh... nostalgia purposes... the wife tells me they must go.


So, who wants some random old porn? I would love to just send them out to whoever wants them, but I cant afford that much shipping, so if you want to be the proud owner of some old dudes porn then make me an offer. Want one mag or 300? doesn't matter to me... paypal me some money for shipping or offer me something and they will be yours.

(Regards contacting an actor)",DeliciousCinnamon,52,13,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/19u4ol/request_my_mother_has_had_an_neurological/,"Hello everyone, my mother has had some neurological disorder (I say 'some' because none of the hundreds of doctors she has been to know what it is) that has been getting increasingly worse for the past 10-13 years, I'm not even sure when it started at this point.

Basically her ability to walk, move, and even function is being taken away from her. She started with a bad walk (almost pigeon toed), and regressed to a cane, walker, and now wheelchair/walker. She can barely live on her own anymore, having an assistant with her at her apartment a few hours per day at certain times, and she has an equivalent to life alert. I get at least a few calls a week while I'm at work saying she pressed the button because she fell, or couldn't get out of bed. I've also noticed this problem has hit her thinking ability as well, usually leaving her wondering ""what's the word?"" when she talks. It sucks, I'm losing my mother very slowly. But it's not even me I'm worried about, it's her. I called her the other day and she was crying over the phone to me about this whole thing, which isn't unusual.

So what I'm turning to Reddit for is, my mother at this point lives for one thing, Jim Caviezel. She loves all his work, is always talking about him, and watching his series ""Person of Interest"". One of her friends who is a good artist even painted an oil painting of him that she has in her room. I'm wondering if you guys could help me perhaps get in contact with Jim somehow, and maybe have him sign something for her, or even write her a short letter somehow. Knowing mother's day is coming up in a few months, this would be the perfect gift and it would really help her out a lot.

Thanks Reddit, hopefully someone will have some leads, or at the least up-vote this so others can see!

I own and run [VlexoFree](http://vlexofree.com). Its a free web hosting service that has two plans to choose from. *Personal 300* which offers 300MB of space and 5GB of bandwidth; this plan is usually for small personal sites/projects. And *Expert 2000* which offers 2GB of space and 20GB of bandwidth; a nice plan for big or business sites.

The server currently supports:

* [PHP 5.2](http://vlexofree.com/info.php) (I like the keep this up to date but 5.3 gives the server problems ATM)
* MySQL 5.1 (with MySQLi)
* PostgreSQL
* Python
* Perl
* CGI
* Ruby on Rails

Sadly theres a requirement for both the plans (sorry!). For the Personal 300 plan I require a linkback on all displayed pages. For the Expert 2000 plan I require the same as the personal plan plus an ad. Nothing is forced on your pages and you can choose where you want to put everything. If you're wondering why I do this, its because I need to support my service somehow.

As requested by a current member of my site there is an ad-free plan for $5/month if you want it (SSH if you ask for it with this plan too).

I'm a very transparent person so if you're wondering what I get from VlexoFree here it is. I make about $6 a month from co.cc referrals, and I haven't received any money for the ads yet. Donations are (so far) the main source of support I get and that can be done and seen in full from the forums.

I think thats everything you need to know.. Feel free to sign up.

Note: I don't run VlexoFree for profit (can you even have profit for free hosting?); I run it to give people who don't have money the opportunity to have a website.

This offer is dedicated to the redditor tree\_of\_life for being awesome :D

The pen looks like [this](http://imgur.com/qCow6.jpg).

United States only please! (Minus Alaska/Hawaii, sorry!)

To get one, all you have to do is:

* Upvote ;D
* Comment in this thread: ""I promise to make an offer thread this month""
* PM me your address

The favors subreddit is a much cooler place when there are more offers than requests, so my motivation behind this post is to help tip that balance.  You might not have an idea for an offer thread right now, but don't let that stop you from making the promise today.  You don't have to pressure yourself to have the greatest offer ever, and you have plenty of time to ruminate on how you'd like to give back to the Favors community.  It doesn't take much.  The simplest offer I can recall was a redditor who was willing to listen to people's troubles.  

So for those first 50 people who make the pledge, enjoy your karmic boost and expect your pen to arrive in February :)

Did the traffic seem like it was coming from people with bad hand-eye coordination and didn't mean to click your ad?

If you looked at the referrer did the traffic appear that it had a chance of being relevant to your site or was it just total random garbage that Google shouldn't have even be showing your ad on?

How much did you end up paying per click?

This all starts with my dad. Long story short, he was pretty sick with kidney failure and diabetes for many years. I moved up to VA from FL to help him, and my mother, and to be with him in what we imagined would be his last couple years. He passed in late august of 2008.

I'm currently a student, just got married (to a fellow Redditor, no less!) and while not broke, I'm between jobs with a prospect for working with UVA, I'm in school which I'm paying for with copious loans, and can barely afford to support myself and the wife. She recently posted an AMA about writing papers, and reddit has been kind with more than a few requests.
My dad, before he passed, left land to my brother and I. My mother, who I'm currently living with, sadly, has lost her god damn mind and declared bankruptcy on the majority of bills my father left her with. She decided she required said land, and sold it to other family we have, and has pretty much squandered all of it on bullshit. The remainder is 4 grand which should arrive here in a month, and it's mine, but I'm stuck waiting a month for it to actually arrive.

Here's the issue. My mother is insane (a story for another time), and has dragged her feet on finishing business because she isn't seeing the last of this cash, I am, and so I've taken it upon myself to speak with said family. The money is being pulled together, but I'm in need of it now as I've found a small studio apartment in the country for ridiculously modest rent (350 instead of ~600) as well as a couple cars that fit my price range. I currently need a car to actually take the jobs that I've gotten offers for, but said mother has pretty much sucked the family dry of any money and asking anyone else for a loan is impossible because of this. She lives off of disability, and cash from her father, in a house my grandmother owns, and respects absolutely nothing.
I'm sure a lot of you still aren't compelled to open your wallets for me. Thats fine. I'm not a Haiti victim, I'm not in some horrible inescapable predicament, I'm just in a really shitty spot in this shit-house economy and need someone to loan me 4k for a period of one month so I can get a leg up, a job, and out on my own again.

TL;DR I need a loan of 4,000 dollars to buy a car and put a deposit on the apartment and am sort of strapped as my mother has sapped my family dry, and fucked up my financial situation by eating my nest-egg. The money will be paid back, in full, in exactly 1 month. I am not asking for donations. There are far more needy people out there. I just need a loan and feel thats already a considerable request.

So I cleared the Mod Q about four hours ago and I just cleared it again and there's like *five* requests for logos.  There usually are.  There are a *stunning* number of logo requests up in this place.  

Logos - particularly good ones - take a lot of work.

So we've got a lot of designers up in here and I really respect your work.  We've also got a lot of non-designers up in here that couldn't give a shit about logos and I really respect your work too.  

And as we've mentioned before - things that are interesting to the general public are much more likely to be resQd from the spam Q (that's the laphroag talking) than things that are extraordinarily specific to your little league team.  But I don't think the logo requests are going to go away, and sometimes they're cool.

So I ask you, humble designers - what do we do with all the logo requests!  And I ask you, humble not-designers - what do we do with all the logo requests!  And I ask you, humble everybody - how much scotch would a woodscotch scotch if a woodscotch could scotch wood?

1291426253.0,38,self.Favors,efxab,[Offer] Free homemade comic book which failed to take off,Urban_Savage,43,5,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/efxab/offer_free_homemade_comic_book_which_failed_to/,"**Final Edit:** - Ok, so I was a little late getting the slug books shipped out, had a bit of a financial meltdown, but they all went out today, leaving me quite broke. :)  Still, I hope everyone enjoys them very much, and anyone who wants to throw a couple bux my way who hasn't already can paypal me at Hudson.Heath@Gmail.com. 


[It started as a joke drawn on post-it notes](http://www.facebook.com/album.php?aid=84632&amp;id=1060579131&amp;l=c432bea817), but demand by coworkers and later by friends got me to take it up a few notches.  I made over a hundred of them with gradually increasing quality, and assembled them into a small spiral bound book (about the size of a Garfield book).  99.9% of everyone who flipped through them loved them, and everyone told me they would sell like hotcakes.  So, I paid to have about 50 of them made to sell, and discovered that although everyone loved them, nobody I could reach was willing to actually pay for them.  So, they sit in my closet gathering dust.

I'd rather they not go to waste since most people enjoy flipping through them, so if I can't sell them, than I will give them away.  If you want one let me know, PM me your address and I'll mail them.  Like I say I have about 30 or 40 left, first come first serve.  However, I will prioritize anyone who thinks they can put one of these into the right hands, or can get me more exposure than sitting on a coffee table.  Guess I still have a tiny thread of hope for them, but regardless, I'd rather see them enjoyed than wasted.

***Edit** - I'm taking down addresses and I'll do my best to get as many of these as I can afford into the mail on Monday.

***Edit 2** - Getting feedback faster than I expected.  Thanks for the support, I continue to collect addresses.  I'm broke as hell and won't be doing much for Christmas for my friends and family, this will help me feel less like a bum this year.

***Edit 3** - A lot of people are asking about paypal for helping me ship.  For convenience sake, anyone who wants to help can send me whatever to:  Hudson.Heath@Gmail.com  -  I'll send as many as I can afford to as great a distance as I can afford until I run out of stock.

***Edit 4** - I'm about out of stock, I've got a list of names and addresses.  Anyone who helps me pay for shipping or has connections for exposure will be prioritized, and the rest will be shipped in order that I have received requests.  Thanks to everyone for the support and commentary.

You have chosen to participate in a thriving and vibrant community of people who like to help each other.  This community has certain rules established by us, your moderators, and certain practices favored by you, the users that combine to create a pleasant and fruitful experience for all... but things don't always go off without a hitch.  Please at least skim this wall'o'text before posting or messaging the Mods.   

 - *The spam filter for /r/Favors is legandarily aggressive  because  asking for favors tends to stink of Internet scammer-hood.  Don't be dissuaded; we spend a fair amount of time picking posts off its teeth.  If you don't see your post show up within an hour or so, MESSAGE THE MODS.*  

**What's a ""favor?""**

 - [The Oracle](http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Afavor&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a) defines a favor as ""an act of gracious kindness.""  /r/Favors, however, defines a favor as ""**An agreement of specific , non-monetary assistance, either asked or offered, between peers.**""     What you're looking for might be better handled elsewhere, as listed here and as listed in the sidebar.

**What other resources are there to ask for or grant a favor?**

 - Well, there's Craigslist, obviously.  If your post would be better served by Craigslist, we'll ban it.  There's Freecycle, too, for those of you more interested in altruism.  If it's ""stuff"" you seek, Craigslist or Freecycle are the way to go.

**I want to give/get help with my/your homework!**

 - [Bam.](http://www.reddit.com/r/homeworkhelp) average-sized subreddit.  Yeah, it's tiny, but at least crosspost in there.

**Could you listen to my song...?**

 - Sure, but [these guys](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/) may be more enthusiastic.

**...critique my poetry...?**

 - Again, [better forums.](http://www.reddit.com/r/writing/)

**...proofread my resume/letter of intent/novel/grocery list/manifesto...?**

 - Again, [better forums.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Proofreading/)

**...send me letters/emails/IMs/smoke signals?**

 - Yes, but [also check here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/penpals/)

**Draw me a picture of [x] riding/fucking/serenading/flaying a [y]?**

 - No.  Requests for drawings will be banned.  *Offers for drawings will be upvoted.*  There's nothing you need so badly you can't wait a few days for someone to offer to draw you anything.  If there is, root around for the last person who offered to draw something and ask them personally.  Constant begging for stuff that interests exactly one person is a drag.  We hope you understand.  EXCEPTION:  Subreddits of over 500 subscribers are invited to request logos in the general interest of publicity and camaraderie.

**Respond to my survey?**

 - Probably.  The general mood of the subreddit can best be gaged [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bn977/request_discussion_about_click_me_fill_out_my/)  Also keep in mind [/r/SurveyJerk](http://www.reddit.com/r/SurveyJerk/ ""which is small, but dedicated to exactly what you're looking for"")because they're all about this stuff.  [*TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS RESOURCE FIRST.*](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bsq9e/offer_i_will_look_over_your_survey_to_make_sure/ ""and be sure to thank her 'cuz she's a nice lady"")

**Pay my rent/keep my heat on/buy my [Z] on eBay so I can afford gas money?**

 - ...yeah, this one's a drag.  We're sorry you're out of sorts.  Unfortunately, we've [talked about this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/d8jkr/request_tempered_thoughtful_discussion_on_whether/ ""numerous times, actually, this was just the latest"") and when we let requests such as these through, they tend to degrade the discussion in the entire subreddit.  *So no, we're not going to let you ask in /r/Favors.*  Great news, though!  ***[/r/Assistance is just the place you need!](/r/Assistance)***


**So you're just trying to drive everyone away.  Got it.**

 - Hardly!  Consider this just another favor - you're likely to get the best response from a group of people focused on freecycling/relationship advice/music making/whatever.  If you look, we haven't been banning much of that stuff.

**Whatever.  So why has my post about composing petrarchan sonnets in response to LOLcats pix been banned?  Huh?  Riddle me that, Batman!**

 - Because lotsa stuff gets banned by the filter.  We'll get to it when we clean out the ModQ, which usually happens every few hours.  We'll get to it, I promise, just be patient.  *No Patience?*  See over there on the right, where it says ""MODERATORS"" and has three names?  Read a little further - see that `""message the moderators""`in little tiny text?  **CLICK ON THAT.**  Vwa.

**But this post or that post or the other post is totally NOT what I consider to be a favor!  In fact, it offends me as if it were a FFUU cartoon of Mohammed and I were Bin Laden's trollface!**

 - Then please *REPORT IT.*  Reported links and posts show up in the mod queue, where they will be viewed and evaluated by a human being.  Said human being may not agree with you, but they will, at the very least, consider your opinion.

**Well, you totally banned my Demonoid invite request.**

 - Damn skippy.  Torrent request swaps go in [**r/Trackers**](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers) plainly visible in the sidebar and elsewhere in this wall'o'text. 

**And what about my Dropbox/Google Voice/Starcraft 2/whatever request?**

 - If it's a serial, invite, beta pass, or anything else related to software and referrals, it goes in [**The Invite Thread.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bw9bl/the_official_rfavors_invite_swap_thread_now/)

Congratulations!  You made it to the end of the Wall Of Text!  You're the kind of Internet Citizen all moderators love.  If at this point you still have questions, feel free to comment below and we'll address them, and then everyone will know the answer!  We all win!  Yaaay!

Please help.",LameDuck,43,5,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bd658/need_to_find_a_job_in_chicago_and_i_need_help/,"So, I've been out of work for two years and because of that break between my last job, I have been unable to get another one. The first year off was not completely my fault. My father had open heart surgery(he's fine now), then my oldest brother had two heart attacks(he's fine, for now) and a month or so after his child was born. So, during that time I was pretty much running errands for my parents since my mother doesn't drive anymore and my father was given specific orders not to. Now I just can't find a job and my work history isn't that great. I worked as a cashier for one place and a cashier/stock/truck unloader for another place(so, I have at least two years working with money, which I'm very fast with). I've done some off-the-books work for a few people during that time, but it doesn't even add up to 50 hours.

After all the crap that happened with my family, things went back to normal. That means my relationship with my father is pretty much gone, since he doesn't really talk to me and yells at me for doing things I had no idea I was supposed to have done(no idea why). My mother just sides with my father, so I have no one to turn to when my father is going crazy. And, my siblings at home don't really talk to me much, because I don't really like the things they do(comedy, weed, cigarettes), but the ones that do like me live out of state and have their own families, so I don't want to bother them with my problems. Other than looking for jobs, I'm alone in my room(two friends in real life, but we are almost never able to hand out).

I have two years of cashiering experience and handling money, I'm pretty good with computers and my English skills are great(with the exception of this post, because I'm writing this while I'm fixing my other pc). I only have a High school diploma, so I'm sure that narrows my options for jobs down.

I know I shouldn't be pick-y about things, but I would like to work in a bank. Anything is fine, really, I mean, I have no choice, but for the last year or so I've just wanted to work in one. I had a license to work as a pharmacy technician, but that's about to expire in two weeks. I never got to work as one so the stuff I learned is almost gone, but I'd like to do that, since I want to go to school to be a pharmacist. That or a place like Sam's Club or Costco.'

TL;DR: I'm unable to find a job due to gap in work history, family life is stressful, I have only two years work history as a cashier and I'd like to work in a bank/pharmacy if possible.

&gt; EDIT: I'm 300lbs and 6'0 tall. Lots of work uniforms don't really fit me, so I'm also hoping to find a place that lets me dress in my own clothes, but in a professional manner(slacks and collard shirts[ties if needed]).

It's time for more changes to how /r/favors goes.

After a two-year run with Klein's experimental model of democratic moderation, we're winding that down and changing back to a somewhat more conventional model of governance.

Why?

Because as much as it saddens me to say it, democratically elected moderators didn't really work out.

Two and a half years on, the team is fundamentally in the same state it was when we started. Klein is still our backroom leader. I still do the bulk (90+%) of the moderating, and we've needed to continually pare down our list of mods who are on the list but not pulling their weight. The rest of our team handles messages, mail, and picks up the slack as needed. (Thank you guys. Seriously. &lt;3)

No rancor towards the removed or past team members, don't get me wrong, nor any blame: it's just really easy to make a convincing speech during an election and comparatively hard to recognize you're signing up to a once-a-day task every day for the next six to eight months. Most new team members have burned out within the first two months - turning a casual procrastination tool into a long-term thankless committment is not always a great idea.

Holding elections did not find us more qualified mods than we might've found by more organic means, nor more dedicated ones. It got us wonderfully charming and friendly ... normal people. With all the ups and downs that comes with.

Sadly, holding elections did come with a cost that adding mods in a more casual manner doesn't hold: every election, there was a new crop of vibrant fresh blood that needed to be trained in the particularly complex and nuanced way we handle our rules, our community, and the relationship between those two and the mod team. We want the mod team to be the best to this community and for this community that we can make it, and we don't feel that re-training a new team once or twice a year is the best way to do that - but if there's no changeover in elections, there's no point in holding them.

So where to from here?

We are going to return to a more aggressively policed mod list, and one that accurately reflects who is actually around and available to the community when you need us. We will be watching the community and active participants in it as potential nominees for future recruiting. We are going to fill the mod list as needed, and only when needed, with folks chosen for our belief in their work ethic, their familiarity with the /r/favors community and its values, and their ability to mesh well with the existing team.

As a result, two major changes to our current roster are incoming.

We're pleased to welcome /u/zomboi to the team, he currently has r/aww, /r/AMA (the smaller ama subreddit), r/seattle and r/gossip under his belt, and is looking to expand his responsibilities and contributions to the larger Reddit community. He is someone Kleinbl00 is familiar with and vouches for - which is enough for me and hopefully for the /r/favors community as well.

And, even more exciting to me, I've finally managed to convince Kleinbl00 to resume active duties in this community - he's been chafing at the bit for a few months seeing the community fall behind when I take a week off to write midterms or exorcize the hellmother of all colds, and I've always felt he and his vision for this community are what drive us to be the place we are - it hasn't felt quite right since he stepped back. I'm very excited to get him back openly and publicly participating in the community and it's continued growth and development.

So, dear Favorites, we're going exciting places this coming year. We hope you've had a fantastic holiday season, and will have a fantastic New Year, and hope that you will continue to stick around and be the true lifeblood of this community.

Then I saw a similar post a few weeks ago and thought, ""That's perfect!  Why didn't I think of that?""  For better or worse, OP abandoned that post, so I took over.  It took a little over a week to make 5 of the requests and they all turned out pretty nice.  When my friends and family saw the pictures they were a little jealous &amp; said I should start charging for them.  The problem with that is, even if I only valued my time at minimum wage, people wouldn't be willing to pay what it added up to (e.g. 30 or 40 bucks for a Reddit alien).  I would prefer to either trade (like something I'm pretty good at making for something unique or something you're pretty good at making), or just make it for free for a good cause (as a thank you to someone for being a ""good guy greg"" in real life. And yes, Reddit counts as ""real life"").   Give me your best  **reasonable** ideas for what to make out of wood, why you want it made, &amp;/or what you're willing to pay or trade for it.  I'll make some of the quicker, easier things for free &amp; I'll take my pick of some of the more difficult requests based on whether I like your suggestion &amp;/or whether the time it would take is worth what you offer in return.   In the other thread there were a lot of requests for things TOO cheap or pointless (like four 6-sided dice. If it's something anyone can buy for cheap, I'm not going to bother with it) as well as things too complex or expensive to make/ship (like an acoustic guitar, [this](http://poptasticbride.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/steampunk-cake-topper.jpg), or [this](http://www.diybookscanner.org/).  The more reasonable your request, the more likely it is to get made.  Here's some examples of the [things I've made so far](https://imgur.com/a/N3nLn) out of wood. **Edit: I should probably clarify that these are just examples of what I've made just to give you an idea of the kind of work I can do. Most of them have already been given away, either to the people who requested them or as Christmas presents**~~

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

~~Now, about that free Reddit alien ( [1st Picture](http://i.imgur.com/sHyMw.jpg) &amp; [2nd Picture](http://i.imgur.com/M8zkd.jpg).  I wanted to come up with a way of determining who gets it that is both fair and fun/amusing (like whoever can balance the most shoes on their head or something), but I failed to come up with anything **really** good so I'm asking you.  I'll send 1 Reddit alien to whoever has the best idea for how I should give away a 2nd Reddit alien in a separate offer. Fair enough? The deadline will be Saturday evening (I'll announce the winner after I get home from work).~~

**The deadline has now been reached and it's time to announce who won the Reddit alien.**  To be honest, I thought I'd get more than only 6 people trying for it and I didn't get any really epic suggestion that's good enough to go down in /r/Favors history like I was kind of hoping, but I did get some pretty good ones and I really appreciate those that took the time to think of them and post them, even if you didn't win (I seriously considered most of them):  The runners up (names permalinked to their suggestions).

And **the winners**. Yes, plural, because I really wanted the next one I give away in /r/Favors to be a fun and entertaining thread, but I also like the ""pay it forward"" idea (True, I came up with all the details, but it was your idea &amp; I fully intend to do it, so fuck it... you get an alien too):

That means I'll be giving all 4 my aliens away, but oh well.  I have the technology to make another one.

Regarding the woodworking suggestions...  I'd still love to hear any good ideas you might have for stuff I should make out of wood, but again, no unreasonable requests (like a boat large enough to fit your whole family and 2 of every kind of creature in the world), and if you're not going to even offer anything in return, I'm probably not going to spend hours making it and spend money shipping it to you for free.  Between the stuff already promised in this thread &amp; the things I've made for Redditors in the last couple months, that's seriously 12 or 13 custom, handmade things that I've sent (or am going to send when they're finished) that each took anywhere from 3 to 15 or more hours each to make.  I don't regret any of it &amp; I know each person really appreciated it, but I can't keep doing this.  I know you'd love to receive something cool &amp;/or unique from a fellow Redditor, because **I feel exactly the same way,** &amp; that day hasn't come yet for me either.  Only two people in this thread offered anything in return, &amp; none of those were actual things (legal advice, upvotes, jokes, GW pictures), though I certainly appreciate that they at least offered and I still might make their requests when I finish the 2 I'm working on just because they were cool like that.  Anyway,  It's been fun &amp; I'll see you around /r/Favors.

Hi, I recently lost about 65lbs and now the majority of my clothes are hanging off of me.  I was also laid off in May and so I'm trying to get by on a very small unemployment check.  I have about 40lbs more that I want to lose, so I'm having a hard time justifying spending money on clothing that will be too big for me in a couple of weeks.  I live in New England in the US, and would be happy to pay shipping costs if there is anyone out there who would like to donate their old clothing to me.  I'm somewhere between a woman's size 10 and 12.  I tend to wear things mostly from Old Navy, but am not terribly picky.  I wear a lot of dresses in the summer, as well as just tshirts and shorts.  I also have several things that no longer fit me, sizes XL to XXL and 14-18 that I would be more than happy to trade in return (this includes 2 dresses and one skirt from Old Navy that I never actually wore).

Anywho, if you have any women's clothing sized 10-12 (or a Medium/Large in tops) that you were thinking of throwing away, please contact me and maybe we can work something out?  Thanks! :D

This is a self.reddit, I'm not trying to get karma. My mom and step-dad, like many others, lost their original job and subsequent jobs due to the economic situation. Temp agencies, and various other employment methods have not yielded anything. This includes attempting to start a home based business. They are now at the lowest point and are short-selling their home to cover the foreclosure.
My mom has always been a selfless woman that has taken in stray friends and pets without homes. I'd hate to see these previously rescued pets be put somewhere that may not care for them or worse.
They currently live in Southern California in Simi Valley near the San Fernando Valley. For the pet's sake, interested parties must be willing to drive to their location or meet somewhere within a reasonable range.
If you know anyone that is looking and is trustworthy, financially stable, and caring, please contact me for more information. I'll have pictures when my mom sends them over.
The pets are as follows: Pet Type: Cat Name: Smokey Breed: Tabby Age: Unknown (Adult &gt;4 years) Sex: Male Weight: 20lbs +/- Coloring: Short hair, Solid Gray with white underside and feet Temperament: Caring and calm Note: Drools profusely when pet and is a lap cat.

Then could you help me out...,bobmeister258,38,5,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/ed1hv/request_have_you_bought_a_nintendo_game_or_dsi_in/,"Most Nintendo games (and all DSi's and DSi XL's) bought after Dec 2008 have a leaflet in the game (or just the serial number on the handheld) that tells you about Club Nintendo. Well, if you register the game on the site, you get 'coins' that can be redeemed for cool stuff.

I am a few coins short from one of the items that I'm trying to get my girlfriend for Christmas, but don't have the money to buy a brand-new game for the codes. If someone is not already a part of the club and don't really care about the coins, could you please PM me any codes you have lying around, or the serial number from your handheld? It would really mean a lot, thanks!

**Edit 3:** BFKelleher has offered to use 800 of his points to ship me the Hanafuda cards! Thank you! In exchange, I'm shipping him one of the pins for 450. :)

I'll still take any codes that people have. By all means, create your own account if you have enough points to get something you want. If not, I'd still like to get those G&amp;W collections :D

**Edit 2:** To help people out, the PIN should be on a leaflet advertising Club Nintendo. It should look like this: XXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXX where the X's are capital letters or numbers.

Also, any DSi or DSi XL system, the serial number on the back should be registerable as well, and then you get an extra 90-day extension on your warranty.


**Edit:** 

For those of you wondering, I'm trying to get the [Hanafuda cards.](https://club.nintendo.com/rewards.do)

Thanks to these people for donating codes! Shower them with karma!

But I need some help with the art.,Oblio56,38,5,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bhcpk/request_im_trying_to_start_a_free_service_to_help/,"I had this idea a few weeks ago after talking with another friend of mine who works the suicide hotline. She was talking to a soldier who had returned home, but was starting to feel lonely and just needed someone to talk to. It got me brainstorming.

First off, anyone who has ANY inklings towards suicide or harm of themselves/others will be redirected to the suicide hotline, without fail. That's what they're there for. And any other emergency crisis' will be forwarded to the appropriate group as well. But for other people (people new to the city, people who feel alienated from their peers, etc) I'm trying to start something new.

I posted an ad on kijiji last week offering to just be someone's friend, and the response has been great. Mostly it's been messages of support, but there were a few people that were honestly looking for someone to talk to. And it felt great helping them, encouraging them, and just being a listening ear. But I know there's more people out there who are feeling isolated, and that's where phase 2 begins with public advertising.

I concoted a flyer telling people what the service is for and how to reach me. Next I'll be setting up a website, and enlisting the help of some other bleeding-heart friends who have expressed interest in helping me with this. But right now, the flyer:

[JPG version](http://homepage.usask.ca/~cac279/freefriend.jpg)
[GIMP Version](http://homepage.usask.ca/~cac279/freefriend.xcf)

I'm trying to keep things simple, as you can see. But you'll also notice a giant white area to the left where I could use a bit of a doodle or something to make the ad more appealing. Anything, really. You could even design a whole new flyer if you wanted. I just want people to not be put off by it, and actually give it some thought.

Questions and comments are completely welcomed. Critique of the outreach model is also open, as I really want this to be a practical, sustainable program. Of course if it gets too large, I'll have to adopt a new strategy, but so far I've seen some success just with email communications.

And if anyone wants to start something else like this up in their own city, that would also be wonderful. :)",,False,,t5_2re6a,False,,,True,t3_bhcpk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bhcpk/request_im_trying_to_start_a_free_service_to_help/,

She's being sued by the IRS because her ex husband failed to pay taxes for a number of years on a high end 6- figure income while they were married. She was a stay at home wife who didn't work and signed the married filing jointly paperwork that he never sent in (although he told her he did). She was given an ""allowance"" to take care of the house and us but had no idea about ""his"" money or what he did with it. 

Well long story short, the statute on claiming ignorant spouse was gone before the divorce happened and long before she found out that they do award it in cases like hers. She has tried to do her own offer and compromise since the divorce, but with all the changes (she re-married with a pre-nup to protect his assets, moves to VA for his job, and has been unemployed after a layoff for the last 9 months) she kept having to re-file. She finally couldn't afford the lawyer anymore.

So now she has no assets, no job, no income, is being sued for something that isn't her fault and has no representation. I am hoping that there may be someone out there in Reddit-land who might be a practicing lawyer in Virginia who would be able to at least give her some counsel so she isn't walking into this blind.

For those that don't know the C2C method, basically it is re-using things completely. When you recycle for example a plastic bottle you take a few and turn them into pens.

Over the past 20 or 30 installs, I have repartitioned the hdd at the clients request, after I explain the benefits. This last format, clean install I did, I was not paying full attention to what I was doing and went on auto mode. The laptop originally had Windows Vista but had Windows 7 installed instead. I assumed it came with Windows 7 so I deleted all partitions including the recovery partition, thinking the product key on the bottom is all I would need. Afterwards, when my product key wouldn't take, I realized I needed Vista, not 7 but it was too late. The boot record and recovery partition was gone. Now I have a clients laptop here with Windows 7 installed and no product key for it. I have about 2 weeks left. I would just format and reinstall Vista but for some reason I can't get any boot cds to load. None. I have tried half a dozen different Linux distros. I have tried UBCD, Hiren's, XP, Vista, Darik's Boot and Nuke, even MiniPe XT. Nothing boots. Only the Windows 7 disk boots.

Well 6 weeks go by with me hassling Wells Fargo about getting our appraisal report from the VA appraiser.  They keep telling me he's waiting on his check to release it.  So, one week from closing he finally releases it because he got paid and it has too much work that needs to be done for the VA to approve.  This leaves me stranded without a home and all of my belongings packed up in my car.  Turns out (and I have the email from wells fargo) that they had lost my check and the appraisal should've been released weeks before.  I would've had time to find a temporary dwelling, etc.  Do I have any sort of case in this? I spent a good month bouncing around shacking up with family and having all my shit packed up in my car.  Trying to drive to work and back like that was miserable, I was stressed out of my mind and SUPER pissed, not-to-mention out all the fees I spent preparing to buy the house and the $500 the VA appraiser cost.

This is a good thing and a cool experience.

Sadly.. I've also discovered how bad the Great Firewall of China is. I have trouble going to many web sites including ones we consider pretty basic in the U.S like Facebook. It's hard to keep in touch with friends and family without it.

Granted I'm not one of those people who 'can't survive' without Facebook. :) If only it were Facebook though then it would be fine. But I'm finding that it's literally thousands perhaps millions of sites that are blocked.

I found that with my old web host (I had a few blogs) that I could SSH tunnel with my web hosting account. I guess I was lucky though because I found out that most web hosts don't even allow this 'feature'. I tried contacting HostGator and some other web hosts to inquire about SSH tunneling if I were to set-up an account. They all said NO.

There are VPN services which charge a foot and a leg per month. Really though and to be completely honest I just want to be able to access a few blocked web sites. I promise not to do anything traffic intensive or anything illegal.
My goal is to access the web sites that I'm used to (like Facebook) without having to use a web proxy with pop-ups going all over the place.

Yes.. I know about Hotspot Shield.. but I find their pop-ups and spam impossible to block even with AdBlock enabled on Chrome. Note: I don't use AdBlock for Reddit. I love this site and read it everyday.

So I promise not to do anything bad. I just want to get back to normal online life and keep in touch with my friends back in the states. Please send me a message if you have a web server in the U.S and can help. Cheers!

",,33,5,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/e39no/requestdo_you_have_any_lego_pokemon_or_littlest/,"Hi - I was just wondering if anyone had any batches of [Lego](http://www.lego.com/en-us/products/default.aspx) (We'd love any kind, but Star Wars, Creator are his favourite but would do a little dance for Mindstorm and Technic), [Pokemon cards or toys](http://www.toywiz.com/pokemon.html), [Hayao Miyazaki](http://jzool.com/home.php?cat=372) anything,  [Littlest Pet shop](http://www.hasbro.com/littlestpetshop/en_CA/shop/browse.cfm) or [Tinkerbell](http://tinkerbell.allaboardtoys.com/) stuff laying around somewhere? We are not fussy. 

I am a single mother (happily) and have two disabled kids 8 and 10. They are really nice humans. My boy is Autistic and Epileptic, with a myriad of other complications. My girl is ADHD with learning disabilities. 

I am not destitute, so I am not begging for help -- I can pay my bills, but cannot afford Christmas this year. We make our own decorations, cards and bake things for people each year.

Recently I wrote to Lego asking if they had a program for my kind of kids. They wrote back saying;

&gt;""yes! we are an amazing company because we bring richness to kids lives, but we **never share** with our customers (seeing as we get several thousand requests per year)- only certain hospitals and non-profits near our manufacturing facilities."" 

(paraphrasing -- but i can put up a scan of the letter if anyone wants to see it, minus our address) This confused me, as they have the ability to really help at least one of my kids. 

It's not a sad life, its a rich and varied existence. I am pleased Secret Santa exists, because I can actually get a gift this year! (I hope mine likes homemade stuff) 

So, if you or anyone you know has any of those types of toys we'd love them! We are Canadian, if that makes any difference. 

Gosh, I hope I don't get yelled at for posting this... *eek* (I really love the kindness and humour here -- so I thought I'd try)

**tl;dr** have toys? want to share?

**edit 1:** Hi! Thanks for writing. I have tried to create wishlists on Amazon.ca called *[Happy ho ho ho](http://www.amazon.ca/wishlist/1RK6LF8ZGX6Q4)* and [Toysrus.ca](http://www.toysrus.ca/wishlist/index.jsp) *Wish List #: 10044795* and Walmart.ca doesn't have a wishlist option. 

If i messed up on those wishlists let me know. I had to create an account for both and learn it all, good advice on those! I have never used wishlists before, so I don't know if I did alrite (am sleepy). If you have different ideas, I am sure those would be fine too. I couldn't find everything I mentioned, but I think I came close.

1271491419.0,31,self.Favors,bs7bb,[Request] Can anybody help a struggling person out?,clairmontster,54,23,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/bs7bb/request_can_anybody_help_a_struggling_person_out/,"WALL OF TEXT:  TL;DR: Received help from redditors, very thankful.


I'm a very poor student with no parental support.  I started school a few years late because of neither parent qualifying as cosigners for my loans and none of my cousins, aunts or uncles willing to help me out.  Due to graduate in December here at Penn State, I'm in a real mess of things financially and physically.  A story:

I had a sharp pain in my side back in february so severe that it forced an ER visit.  Turned out to be peritonitis and they stopped it before I had to get surgery, but not before I developed sepsis.  Got treated, paid a deductible, went on with life.  I then developed really serious pains in early march and went to the ER again.  The difference between the visits: no insurance the second time.  I couldn't afford to pay 800 bucks to renew it for a year at the time.  Also, it wasn't peritonitis the second time, it was pancreatitis.  Topping the cake was that my kidneys, bladder, stomach and urinary tract were infected.  I knew it would be beyond expensive, but there's nothing I can do about that.  I barely have 20 bucks to my name at any given time and cannot even pay my regular bills when they are due; so I figured that it would be alright to tack on another reason to lose sleep every night.

My school schedule keeps me from being able to have any job of substance.  I'm taking 20 credits this semester, summer semester as well as my final semester this fall.  I'll be up at 8 AM on monday/wednesday/friday for class til 10:20 AM, then I'll have a short break to run home and cook food to eat and finish up some classwork before sprinting back to class at noon.  The noon class starts a brick of classes that goes until 3:30, which then turns around into another class at 7PM.  Tuesdays and thursdays, I have a class at 10 AM, noon, 2pm and 6pm.  No employer that is hiring is willing to flex their hours to meet my schedule.  

To make money, I'd been working under the table at a pizza place and donating plasma twice a week this semester until I got really sick.  I had to quit my job because my medication impairs me beyond belief and I can't take it during class without a serious detriment to my grades.  It also makes me ineligible to donate plasma for six weeks after taking each dose, so I can't make any money that way for a while.

I'm behind two months on rent (1050 total) and can't afford next week's march electric bill deadline (90 bucks).  I cut my internet and cell phone off in february since I could not forsee myself paying for them (a friend decided to pay for a prepaid phone for me, so I use that).  I have sold my TV, appliances, desktop, furniture and a large amount of clothes to supplement my bills.  I have nothing left to get rid of to make a quick desperation buck; all I own now is my cheap 60 dollar laptop, a set of clothes, a school bag and my pillow.  My student loans' fine print has forced me to start paying them back which is sapping another 220 a month.  Finally, my ER bill from march came in today.  I owe 5322.60.  Now that 800 for insurance doesn't seem so bad, but doesn't change the fact that I couldn't/can't afford it.

If I give up eight credits and drop to 12 (the bare minimum for full time), I'll be able to work but have to stick around next spring as well.  Pretty much, the overlaying tone of my day is that of a drug addict.  A drug addict hooked on school.  My problems would be over if I stopped or cut back, but it's nearly the end of the semester and I'm banking on a 4.0 which will set my cum. GPA to 3.5, which is required by my major for graduating.

I don't know what to ask for, so I will ask for two things.  First, could anybody spot me money to buy groceries or clip coupons for me so I can pay very little for a decent amount of food for a week or two?  I eat vegetarian so I like to prepare my own food.  I would offer receipts from the store (I shop at giant http://www.giantfoodstores.com/).  The only food I have right now is a bag of frozen peas and two packs of ramen.  Sure, it's three pounds of peas, but they will run out.  Second, can anybody help me find a way to knock out that 5322.60 medical bill?  I can probably work something out with my landlord to keep getting kicked out, and can probably set up a payment plan with my power company to keep the lights on another day, but there's nothing I know of that I can do to make that 5000 change to something easier to swallow.

http://i.imgur.com/qjfWv.jpg  -  Bill that I want to take the numbers from and change them to smaller numbers.  Very fuzzy, sorry.  I don't own a scanner.  If you can read my address, mail me an encouraging letter or something.

http://imgur.com/OaXIP.jpg - Tried to zoom in on the price, but it didn't work.  It's 5322.60

http://i.imgur.com/GdUMl.gif - My bank account.  I had 97 cents to my name yesterday until a nice person sent me 60 bucks to spend on a birthday cake and a fishing license.  I'm up to 11.87 now :)

I'm in a 20 foot deep hole and instead of throwing me one end of a rope and helping me up, my friends and family are either outside of the hole cheering for me to climb out, ignoring my cries for help or covering the hole up.  Is anybody able to offer advice on reducing the cost of a medical bill if you are not financially capable or toss me some money so I can stock up on frozen vegetables and ramen noodles?  I hate myself for asking, but would hate myself more if I didn't

EDIT - Monday, April 26th, 12:35 PM EST
A little over a week later and I would like to thank the people who helped me out while I was in a huge bind. I am much better off after your help.  I had three people send me a little bit of money and it went a long way.  I have food and the power's still on.  My medical bill got drastically sliced down, and I'm crossing my fingers that I will be eligible to have it reduced to nothing.  Things are looking way up.  Of course there's still the other bills to work on paying now that they are all on extended payment plans of some sort.  It's much easier to have $20 to your name and stare at $2800 in bills than almost $8000.  It's pretty scary to me knowing that if I didn't post this here, I wouldn't have realized that I could fix most of my problems by calling the right people.  How basic is that concept and how terrible is it that I didn't consider that as a solution.

https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/132_6377471405_7040_n.jpg

I've got a close friend who served in Iraq and Afghanistan. During his military time he became close with the wrong groups of people, and ended up smuggling drugs into the united states from mexico. he was captured with a large amount and sentenced to a few years in prison. he's served all his state time already, and now is serving his federal time. and I can't help but feel bad for him.

he's been going through a lot lately. his girlfriend left him, sold all his belongings and cut all contact with him and his children. his other friends cut ties with him because they couldn't be bothered to email, or write him.(in federal prison he has email access through a prison website). Me and 1 other friend are really the only ones who ever write him. We try to email him in a daily basis, he gets computer access every few hours so it's kind of a bummer when you only have 2 people emailing you, or writing.


I'm trying to find him some penpals, because I can only imagine how boring prison might be. If you'd be interested in writing him, just send me a PM with your email address and name.(he needs to send you an invite through the prison system website), or if you want his mailing information, I'll give it to you.

-i'm gonna adopt a puppy from the pound.

my schedule for tomorrow is this:

5am - head to work at the kitchen
7am - go to gym do cardio
8am - go back to work
11 am - haircut and shave
12:30pm - go back to gym for weights (back)
2pm - light snack/shower
3pm - mail call
5pm - dinner
6pm - college class
7pm - American idol
9pm - bs with the homies
11pm - bedtime

that's a normal day for me, i don't usually watch tv much but i make an exception for american idol and x-factor. and WWE on mondays. sometimes i'll watch a movie if they're playing something good, they haven't posted what the movies are for this week. softball season is gonna start and we usually watch the games on saturday, just to heckle the players.


-----------
without doubt fed time is better. we don't call it club-fed for nothing, let me put it to you this way...every meal here is what they would give us in state for a ""holiday"" like christmas or 4th of july. we have free weights, a gym, softball field, pool tables, lot's of tv rooms with cable and 42"" tv's. this place is pretty laid back, compared to some of the units i was in at state prison.



-------------

i always miss In-&amp;-Out cuz they don't have them in texas...but i'm always parcial to Jack-in-the-box. hmmm ultimate cheeseburger! and what i really want right now is a steak, either from Texas Roadhouse or Cattleman's. but it's been so long i might OD on steak!

look, you've ever seen those shows: 

-Locked up
-Gangland
-Scared Straight
and any of the other stupid ass reality shows.... prison is nowhere near none of that shit. people don't stab you or try to rape you for no fucking reason. i was in state, in a real rock-n-roll unit, shit popping off left and right but that's cuz fucking youngsters don't want to listen to the rules. they think they can do whatever they want, not realizing they're not out in the freeworld.

your jokes were funny, but some of the shit is wrong...in higher security yeah i'd have my own toilet, not here. and also these old fucks here that only come here for 3-6 month sentences, they think they're out there in their own home and they won't even ask they'll just change the channel! you can't beat them up though cuz they already have one foot in the grave.




--------------


i have hundreds of prison stories dude, everyday there's something new going on around this place.

some of the funniest things i've heard around this place include gems like these:

-""fuck! i forgot my loofa!"" (heard in the shower)

-""i'm almost done with my quilt, then i'm gonna start making some scarfs"" (they have crochet here)

-""this is not the right shade of pink, i ordered salmon!"" (again, crochet)

-""out in the freeworld i owned both a mercedes and a benz"" ""isn't that the same thing?"" ""NO IT ISN'T YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW"" (stupid black people talking)

-""i think my wife is cheating on me"" ""why do you say that?"" ""i called the house and my kid said: mommy my other daddy is calling"" (at the phone center)

-""you think this is kosher?"" (porkchops for dinner, stupid jews!)

you got to realize homie, we're locked up for a reason...we're not the sharpest tools in the shed.



--------------
this week we're watching that Alex Cross movie, i've stopped reading those books cuz they're all kinda the same.
ever since i came here i've developed some guilty pleasures...i secretly grab my celli's mp3 and listen to all his pop music while i read vampire novels designed for 16 yr old girls.  i need to get out!

tell your sister that she needs to read the Vampire Academy novels, there's like 7 total, i'm on the 5th one. after that there's the Bloodlines saga by the same author, but tell her not to even read the back of the book cuz it gives a lot away. i liked these more than i liked the Twilight ones.

Law is by far, not even in my top 25 subjects. 



-----
there is no limit to the amount of pictures i can get...i can only get them in batches of 25 per envelope. otherwise they get sent back. no frontal nudity, nipples and shit like that. you can send me magazines, unfortunately no Playboy, Hustler or penthouse type publications :( if you do send me a magazine, send me the WWE magazine....no one gets that mag here. and you should start watching it again. The Rock is WWE champ and Cena is gonna fight him for the title on Wrestlemania, CM Punk pulled a bitch move and gets to fight the Undertaker. he thinks he can beat the undertaker's 20-0 streak at wrestlemania. my favorite wrestler right now is Ryback, i want to get that big O_O

i get the money in my books and i can go to store and buy shit, i'm saving for a pair of boots. they cost 100 bucks. they sell mp3's, my celli has one and that's why i got nothing but katy perry, ke$ha and taylor swift in my head. the mp3 is 75 bucks, and each song is a either .85 cents to 1.05 depending on popularity i guess. they sell other stuff on the store, food, clothing items and shit like that.

-------------

lol i don't have much dude, i've only gotten paid for 2 months at this current rate. i was making 5 bucks a month when i started. this friday is payday, but they're gonna take 25 bucks off for my fine. and i want boots cuz the ones they sell are nonslip and the ones they give us are like rollerblades on wet surfaces. i work in the kitchen man, you know how much water gets thrown around? and no you can't mail me boots

I am desperate. On July 17th, my SO’s and my apartment burned down in the U.S. We lost everything. There are some things we will be able to replace in time. With other things, we’re not so lucky. 

One of those things is a plush cat my SO and I adored. Pictures here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/31671078@N05/
This thing was a serious part of our lives—posing it for humorous pictures and the like. My SO is very obviously crushed after the fire, all the more so because our things are a complete loss with no possibility to retrieve anything.

This is where you come in. I have looked for this thing on the internet with no luck. If anyone knows where to currently obtain this plush or has a copy he/she is willing to part with, we would be solidly grateful. In fact, so much so that not only would we be very happy to pay for said plush (cost/reward, shipping &amp; handling, etc.), but I will go out of my way to make a thank you video with the plush and post it.
I don’t have many clues to go on, as this plush didn’t come with a brand or a tag. But, I know that this plush was obtained in Japan from an Aeon JUSCO, likely during the Valentine’s Day holiday season several years ago (no more than five). 

Thank you for any help or leads, and even if you can't help, please pass this on to anyone who might be able to.

edit: Another clue, this thing also came in a white version in Japan.

edit: another detail- It was purchased in a supermarket in Japan, 2008, during Spring Break in Murakami.

edit: Good news! No replacement is necessary. Thanks to the kindness and hard work of one very dedicated individual, we were able to retrieve the original. Thank you to everyone who helped. In the future, we will be sure to encase our current version in carbonite so that something like this can never happen again.

As such, those of you who feel dissatisfied with the rules of /r/favors and the way they are carried out are invited to make your case to the subreddit for your election to moderator. Those of you who are pleased with the way this subreddit has been run for the past six months are encouraged to cast your votes behind the incumbents. /r/favors is a particularly prickly subreddit to moderate and it is important that all who participate know that the rules and their enforcers have been chosen by the ruled.

I, personally, wish to encourage anyone who values this community and feels they have a few minutes to spare every day to apply to moderate. ""Moderation"" on Reddit is often undertaken by readers as a way to give back to the community they value, and it is my opinion that there are few communities that ""give back"" more than this one.

Please use the space below to announce your candidacy and give reasons to the community explaining why you would be a good moderator of /r/favors for the next six months.  The top 20% of candidates will be listed in the final voting post on Wednesday, February 29 2012. The top 5 candidates will govern /r/favors until September 1, 2012.

   Starting something new without any guidance might be a little hard for some people, so I figured someone might want to do the ""Recruit a Friend"" offer with me (a few other people might help out as well). 


   Basically, for a certain time, we would be playing the game together and in doing so would give added benefits for the both of us. I am a casual player and have been playing for an extended period of time, but could show you the ropes. Here are some more details: https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/recruit-a-friend-faq


   I thought it would be a cool way to meet some awesome people and enjoy this experience. Though, if you were alright with starting up an account by this manner but did not want to play together(for whatever reason), I could still benefit from the experience and receive the in-game mount which, aside from making new friends, is also nice to have.


   I would make a character solely to level up with you (whichever side you prefer), though there might be others helping out. We would dedicate our playtime to you until the 90 days has passed and let you on your way (if you prefer), but definitely want to stay in touch if you want to. I will help you earn gold, learn the game, teach you the basics, level you up, and so on. As I said, we're casual players who are on at least 5 days a week, don't obsess over the game, won't go crazy if you skipped out on days of playtime because you have other things to do, are perfectly fine with the fact that you may or may not be a beginner, and are looking to enjoy our WoW experience and make new friends. 

   If you need help with anything relating to how to set up an account, the Blizzard site might be better suited for you but I can answer any questions you have to the best of my abilities if you pm me.


   Even if you have begun and just want to talk or a few people to quest/help you level/do dungeons with, we're alright with that as well!

I am the new proud owner of a vinyl plotter, and i'd like to get my feet wet cutting different things. So I'm offering those interested a free smallish sticker of their choice.   
rules: you'll need a good resolution file to start with. It needs to be in one color. I have vinyl in black and white, so those are your options. I'm working with a vinyl cutter, not printer, so it needs to be a design with relatively thick lines.   
[This is doable](http://www.decalsforfun.com/Sea_439.htm)   
[This is not](http://www.broomcloset.com/pix/decals/Antlersmoons.jpg)   
Go crazy with your requests, I need the training. I'll ship them to you for free. I 'll do them in a couple of inches long size, unless you need something specific.   

**edit**: Whoah, lots of takers, I did not forsee that. I'll try to make everyone happy within reason, but as you might have guessed, I'm in Europe and it's time for me to go out. Please bear with me, It might take me a bit of time to fulfill all requests. I'll try to work in batch. I'm out, be back in 12 hours or so.   
**edit2**: aaaaand I'm back. okay, i'll start working on the first ones, will keep updating with the first results. stay tuned.   
**edit 3 ** Okay, I'm up 30 requests, I'm sorry but I'll have to draw the line somewhere. I have replied to everyone that posted up to now, I'll have to stop accepting more for the moment. Now i'll start working. If anyone is interested, I'll post pics of the process.   
** edit 4 ** ~~ I just looked up the mailing costs. Hughhh. If there is a kind redditor in the US willing to accept a big envelope with all the small envelopes inside to repost them as domestic mail, I can paypal you the priceof the postage. I figure I will be cheaper that way. ~~ Okay, Hopeful_Optimism offered to mail all the US - based stickers for me, fantastic !

[here](http://imgur.com/Ysii8) and [there](http://i.imgur.com/dTlGL.jpg) are the first finished stickers.

** Final edit **  Ninety percent of the stickers are in the mail now. They will be kindly remailed by Hopeful_Optimism for all you US-based. There are a couple left that  
* I had a technical issue with  
* I 'm missing tha address for.  

Those will be mailed out individually.

**Placement instructions **  
===========
please read this before attempting to place your sticker, you might be very disappointed by the end result if you don't follow this: 

* Surface: The surface must be smooth, if possible. The best is, for instance, glass. The stickers  will stick to porous materials, but not as well  .
* The temperature of the surface is important: it needs to be at least room temperature. anything colder will significantly reduce the sticking power of the adhesive.  
* Cleaning is important. Clean twice with windex , or soapy water, then , if possible, once more with rubbing alcohol to remove all residues.   
* Peel back the backing (the opaque sheet). The sticker should remain, adhesive side exposed, on the transfer paper (the half transparent sheet)  
* place your sticker flatly, sticky side down, on the substrate (surface where you want your sticker to go).  
* using a credit card or equivalent, really rub well the sticker into the substrate. Really go for it, don't be afraid to apply some pressure. It's especially important for stickers with elaborate thin pieces.  
* grab one of the corner from the transfer paper, and slowly pull back at a 45 degree angle, and as flat against the sheet as possible. This is the tricky part.  
* If some of the sticker peels off with the transfer paper, reapply, re-squeegee some more with the credit card, and try lifting from a different angle.   
* If you have a big surface, you might notice some air bubbles trapped. The smaller ones should dissapear by themselves within a couple of days. you can try to get rid of them yourself, by piercing a tiny hole *on the edge* of the bubble and then slowly squeegee the air out with a credit card.

See [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERd5SQsq-3U) for more application tips and techniques if you're unsure.

Rent is coming up (have to mail check by the 29th) and I'm short by about... $700. That's not including the Verizon bill and Electric bill, but they can be put off for about a week or so. I work from home so I have all day, every day for 7 days to take requests. I would prefer to do the portraits in soft pastel, it's much quicker and I have never been disappointed by the results. But if you have other requests, just ask (I'm also a painter, though acrylics would be quicker to get finished)! Of course these drawings won't be 5 minute sketches, but they will instead be something that is actually worth framing.

I ask that everyone can be as patient as possible, because I do not want to rush anyone's portrait. I will keep each and every one of you as updated as possible with the progress.

**Shipping (USPS Priority Envelope):**

**United States: $4.90**

**Canada &amp; Mexico: $11.45**

**Other countries: $13.45**


All that is “required” is the shipping money via Paypal so I can ship your picture. I will accept “tips” with wide open arms, though they are not required! 

I will be shipping via Priority Mail (USPS), so the pictures can't be larger than 12in x 9in. I will also be scanning high resolution images of the portraits upon completion, so you will receive a high resolution scanned copy and the original piece.

You do NOT have to have the drawing shipped if you don't want. I can just draw it and scan it for you if you prefer. Just let me know via PM what you would like. All I ask is that you send over a few bucks via Paypal.

**If you would like to receive something larger than 12in x 9in, please contact me via PM. We may be able to work something out!**

I also am completely broke other than the money I have stashed away for rent, so unfortunately I can't offer to frame them for you. But you are more than welcome to frame them yourself!

What I ask is for you to please send payment to the Paypal email listed below, and **please** write your Reddit username in the comment section on the Paypal page! Then, please send me a PM here on Reddit with a link to your picture(s) along with any other comments/suggestions, your delivery address, and your Paypal email address. If you want me to write anything on the portrait, such as your pet's name(s) or whatever – just ask in the PM!

I will be doing portraits in chronological order from when Payment was received and PM was sent. Portraits will hopefully be shipped out the same day they are completed, but I will keep everyone updated! 

(Thanksgiving – Thursday, 25th  - I will only be able to squeeze in 1-2 portraits. I have to work all day WHILE sitting down and eating with my family... haven't figured out *how* yet, but it will be done!)

And before anyone writes anything crazy, one, I am not interested in doing any weird craigslist type sexual things (my significant other being from East LA may want to cut you and me), and two, I am not interested in wearing your skin as a coat or keeping a slide with your blood on it.

Hi! About 11 days ago ago I asked redditors from a number of subreddits (e.g., r/sex &amp; r/relationship_advice) to complete a research survey concerning the relationship between communication factors and infidelity. 91 redditors were nice enough to participate, which allowed me to run some preliminary analysis on the data (so far so good!). Unfortunately, 91 responses are not enough to generate adequate statistical power for the statistical tests that I am using. As such, I'm hoping that I can collect more responses today to reach my goal of at least 200 responses. 

The following is an edited version of my original post that includes important information to consider prior to participating in the study:

##############/

Hi! I'm currently collecting data to use primarily to complete my dissertation, which focuses mostly on the relationship between communication factors and infidelity. The study is completed entirely online in a survey website and is made up of about 120 close-ended questions and a few short open-ended questions, e.g., how old are you? No information that could be used to identify any person will be collected.

In accordance with my university's procedures concerning the ethical treatment of human subjects, you will be asked to read a consent form and agree to participate in the study prior to starting it.

Although I am not able to provide any monetary compensation for your valuable participation in the study, I would like to return the favor to the reddit community by doing an IAMA where I discuss the study's rationale and findings (as well as any other information I might know concerning what the academic literature has to say about infidelity) shortly after I successfully defend my dissertation.

##############/

If you do decide to participate, which I would greatly appreciate, the link to the study is here (Link deactivated on Mar. 8, 2012).

Not a favorite was stirring, not even Pdub;

The requests were hung by the new queue with care,

In hopes that some upvoter soon would be there;

The posters were nestled all snug at their desks,

While visions of Christmas cards danced in their asks;

It's mods all up in /r/aww and /r/breaddit;

Had just settled down for a winter's reddit,

When up in the Spam queue arose such a clatter,

I checked the filter find out the matter.

Away to the spam queue I flew like a flash,

Swung the banhammer, leaving nothing but ash.

The mail requests well exceeded the snow

Did little but crush small posts far below,

When, what to my wondering eyes should appear,

But a wonderful favorite, and such magnificent cheer,

With a generous offer, so kind and warm,

I knew right then it must become the norm.

More precious than bacon, as offers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, a solution found;

""No more requests! Only offers, send them all 'round!

""Now, browser! now, reader! now, sulky card seeker!

Come one, come all, just give, don't be a sneaker!

To the top of the page! to the top of /r/all!

Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!""

**TL;DON'T LIKE POETRY?**  ""Send me a card please!"" will take over if we don't moderate them strictly.  We learned this last year.  We want to remind everyone that posts asking for cards get removed, but we really love seeing posts offering cards, and they always do well.

He helps in many of the shelters around the city by riding his bike to each counseling those who are troubled and tries his best to help.  He says that hygiene is low and clean clothes are hard to come by, but what makes dirty clothes at least bearable is to have a pair of clean underwear.  It's not something you really think to bring while running away from a tsunami, and it is actually something that a lot of people are lacking right now.  I've been helping as much as I can by organizing fund raisers and donating as much money as I can even though I'm still easily categorized as a poor college student.  I just dropped $100 on underwear that I am mailing out tomorrow, and I want to see how much reddit can reach out and add to this.

If you would like to contribute, please feel free to pm me and I'll send you the address to send them to.

To put a face on the family here are a few links to my photoblog pages for the time I was there.

This is what we experience, and Onagawa town where we had passed fliers of church guidance for several years, and now about 80% of 12,000 populated s totally destroyed by the earthquake and tsunami. We supply foods, water, blankets, powdered milk, sanitary things, and etc.

 

Please keep praying for us, so we don’t lose strength to help people.

EDIT 2:  Ok, signing off for tonight.  I'll have my phone while manning the donation booth tomorrow at my school, so I'll be able to answer comments then (starting 10AM PST).  Goodnight reddit my sweet. &lt;3

EDIT 3: I'm awake, and I received an another offer for a donation overnight!  And I also now realize that this probably wasn't the best title to overlap with April fools day.  Oh well.

EDIT 4: Already been orangered a few more times today with offers.  Reddit you are awesome!

EDIT 5:  Welp, it looks like the post is slowly slipping down the front page of r/favors.  It had a good run and there were a good number of donations.  I'll be sure to post anything that my host dad replies with when the packages start arriving!  Good job Reddit.  I'm sure some people are going to be very happy!
