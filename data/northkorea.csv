1323646954.0,294,self.northkorea,n8ysx,I travel to North Korea annually AMA,Zaruka,351,57,163,http://www.reddit.com/r/northkorea/comments/n8ysx/i_travel_to_north_korea_annually_ama/,"I am an American citizen who travels to North Korea each year. I have done so since 2008 and have a total of 38 days in the country. I have been requested to do this by several users so I will give it a try. 

1. Why do you travel to North Korea? 
There are a number of reasons for me. The first is that I have traveled all over the socialist bloc in the old days and North Korea is the last one standing. I was raised as an Army brat and saw the Cold War from the other side. I have a degree in East Asian politics and this was only natural to want to go after traveling China in the old days. I also have a disdain for ""experts"" of any kind that have never set foot in the society they are studying. (This was very common during the Cold War and with North Korea.)

2. How can you go if you are an American? 
Easy, just get on a tour. There is a preconception that Americans cannot go. That is just not true. On my first trip people online accused me of stealing photos. Now I routinely find my photos stolen by others. 

3. What do you see as a tourist? 
That depends. On your first visit you will see very little relative to what you expect to see. You will see some interesting things but unless you know what to look for you will not see that much. You will be well fed and meet lots of nice people. If you have not been to a totalitarian state, what would you know to look for? If you go back or stay long enough you will begin to see behind the society and get a better picture of things. 

4. What are you allowed to photograph? 
One of the reasons I go is to document the society. I have taken 20,000 photos. The photo restrictions are the toughest I have encountered. I used to tour Eastern Europe on my own as well as the USSR but this is something different. In Cuba they do not care what you shoot. Here you will have minders and it can be difficult. I want to take photos of the Korean people and their lives. That is not always possible. They will not shoot you but they will threaten or get others in the group to talk to you. 

5. Why do you go back?
Again I want to see this society and the longer I can stay the more I see. This year we got to see things not seen before: an air raid, ""the speaker,"" more construction , the poorest areas of the country, and more things tourists do not get to see. Remember this, they cannot hide everything and the longer you stay the more you will see.

**Documentaries**

* Crossing the Line
     2006
     The film is about a former U.S. Army soldier, James J. Dresnok, who defected to North Korea on August 15, 1962. It's an interesting insight on what life in Pyongyang is like, and some good history on the Korean War. (thanks to razorbeamz)

* Dear Pyongyang - very different than all the other NK documentaries I've ever seen. It's from the perspective of an ethnic Korean Japanese girl whose family is part of the Pro-North Korea Zainichi Korean community. Has a much more human feel to it as it is the documentary a girl makes about her family, who just happens to be active supporters of North Korea. The film is split between Japan and North Korea, and it is in Japanese and Korean but I was able to find English subtitles for it. I highly recommend it for anyone who can track it down. (thanks to Caesar1313)

*  Friends of Kim
    2006
    From the website: ""Hilarious and sobering account of the first time an international group of Kim Jong Il supporters visits North Korea""
    A documentary following a trip to Pyongyang by the official North Korea 'friendship' club. It's president is a wacko Spanish citizen who is also the only foreigner to hold a North Korean passport. Recommended! [Official info](http://www.micromovies.nl/?p=films&amp;film=3)
[Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C76HqPaA6kw)

*   North Korean Film Madness
    2010
     It's about Kim Jong Il's film obsession and covers his orders to kidnap a Japanese film director in order to make movies to his taste. Vice hasn't failed me yet in finding good information or entertainment, which is why I feel fine recommending this blindly. (thanks to wishinghand)

*  Inside North Korea
    2007
    Under the disguise of working with a doctor, Lisa Ling goes into North Korea and tries to learn about the people there. (thanks to ohwhereohwhere)

* Themepark 1984 is my favourite. I liked it quite a bit better than the Vice one. The commentary gets very sarcastic the further into the trip he goes. It also shows the themepark
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCIdUH0__Us (thanks to bombastica)

* Det røde kapel AKA The Red Chapel
2009
""Two Danish comics, one of them a self-described spastic and both born in Korea, join the director on a trip to North Korea, where they have been allowed access under the pretext of wanting to perform a vaudeville act.""
Probably my favorite NK documentary that I've seen. It's part-documentary and part-comedy shot on location in NK. Of course, it helps that their North Korean minder can't speak Danish, so they freely mock the regime in front of everyone. (thanks to tetrisattack)

* Joseon School AKA Our School (documentary)
2007
""After the liberation of Korea in 1945, the first generation of Koreans residing in Japan refurbished an old factory and founded ""Our School"" (a.k.a. Joseon School) in hopes of preserving their culture and heritage in a foreign land. Our School offers an up-close and personal look at the everyday lives of the young students of Our School, now in its third generation. The film is filled with genuine moments of laughter and tears, plus a shocking historical fact that points to the North Korean government as the school's main sponsor.""
I'm recommending it because it's about a topic not often covered in these NK documentaries - the Japanese-Koreans who remain loyal to NK and think of NK as their ""Fatherland."" The coolest part is probably the last 20 minutes or so, when the kids go on a field trip to North Korea. (thanks to tetrisattack)

* A State of Mind (2004): A British documentary that follows two young North Korean girls as they prepare for the Mass Games, the world's largest choreographed gymnastics performance. (thanks to yang_gui_zi)

* The Game of Their Lives (2002): A BBC documentary producer is given unprecedented access in North Korea to chronicle the story of the famed 1966 World Cup team from the North that advanced to the quarterfinals. The feature includes interviews with surviving members of the team, English fans and soccer pundits who saw the North Koreans upset Italy, 1-0, and go up 3-0 against Portgual before Eusebio eventually rallied the Portugeuse. (thanks to yang_gui_zi)

* Vice Guide to North Korea: American journalists take a heavily-guided tour of North Korea with some pretty strange findings. Not of much academic value, but very entertaining. [Preview link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RG4gL3eAHVs).
There is also a sort-of sequel on North Korean labor camps in Siberia. [Link here](http://www.vice.com/vice-news/north-korean-labor-camps-part-1) (thanks to NanobotOverlord)

* Suspicious Minds: [Link here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lj9uNKT07xs&amp;feature=g-vrec&amp;context=G24118afRVAAAAAAAAAQ) (thanks to CalamityOne)

* DPRK: The Land Of Whispers (North Korea Travel Documentary) (2013): [Youtube link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oULO3i5Xra0) (thanks to CernaKocka)

**South Korean films**
(thanks to Fix-my-grammar-plz)

I recommend the following South Korean movies related to North Korea. Most of these won't get you know more about North Korea. I'm only listing them for those who want pop-corn fun.

    Secret Reunion, 의형제, 2010

Abandoned North Korean agent meets another laid off South Korean agent. Why watch this? It's got Song Kang Ho. This is set around the time of Asian economic crises.

    Typhoon, 태풍, 2005

An action movie. The protagonist is a North Korean pirate. Why watch this? What's more badass than an angry North Korean pirate?

    Crossing, 크로싱, 2008

A North Korean crosses the border to get medicine for his son. You will get to know how this crossing thing usually work out.

    South of the Border, 2006

Another North Korean crosses the border. It plays out differently from the above. So you can enjoy both.

    Poongsan, 풍산개, 2011

I haven't seen this. It's about someone who delivers goods from South to North Korea. He has to deliver a person this time. You need to watch this because it is produced by badass director Kim Ki Duk.

    Joint Security Area, 공동경비구역 JSA, 2000

North Korean soldiers and South Korean soldiers accidentally meet at the border between two Koreas. Directed by Park Chan Wook way before he got famous for Oldboy.

    Double Agent, 이중간첩, 2002

The protagonist is a North Korean double agent. He crosses the border when South Korea was under military dictatorship. It's a good spy movie except for that silly romance.

And three South Korean movies on Korean War. All three are quite different.

    Brotherhood of war, 태극기 휘날리며, 2004

    71 into the fire, 포화 속으로, 2010

    Front Line, 고지전, 2011

For the casual observer the cult of personality was directly linked to Kim Il-sung but that belies the individual monuments and indoctrination that the peole of North Korea experience. Despite few independent statues to the son of Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-suk, the cult of Kim Jong-il was one seemingly reserved more for the citizens of the country, rather than projected outward to the world. Perhaps study of the cult of Kim Jong-il can provide clues to the efforts of the North Korean regime to move into a new era of Kim Jong-un’s leadership.

The cult of Kim Il-sung was well established in the mold of Josef Stalin in the post-war period with large portraits carried in parades and adulation agitated by party regulars. Kim’s reputation as fighting the Japanese was secured and perhaps solidified by the Japanese occupiers who offered rewards for this leader of the anti-Japanese struggle. Some attribute the cult of personality of Nikolai Ceausescu as imitative of the cult of Kim Il-sung. Aspects of Mao Zedong’s adulation also are reflective in North Korea but the supernatural aspects of Mao have not been directly attributed to Kim Il-sung. 
The birth of Kim Jong-il in Siberia in either 1941 or 1942 was remolded into a story of mythic proportions. The son of the great revolutionary was born in the Paektu region at the “secret camp” during the anti-Japanese war. The humble revolutionary origins (a log cabin in the wilderness) of the Dear Leader are emphasized as well as his father’s anti-Japanese work. There is a story about the rainbow that appeared above Jong-il peak (the mountain behind the secret camp) when he was born but like other stories they seem to be for consumption of the less educated people and are not found often.

That prestige of the great revolutionary was passed to the oldest son by Confucian tradition. While it is rumored that dynastic succession was opposed by some in the Worker’s Party of Korea (WPK), Kim Jong-il worked for years under his father and murals with both Kims appeared conveying legitimacy to Kim Jong-il over time.

Individual murals and sculptures of Kim Jong-il without his father are rare but not unknown.  Statues in town squares are reserved for Kim Il-sung and so-called “Immortality towers” have been erected to honor the Great Leader. Singular murals with the likeness of Kim Jong-il have been seen on military bases.
 
Adulation for Kim Jong-il can be found in homes and offices where the portraits are on the wall opposing the entrance at the highest location. Other photos of the leaders with the home owner or at the workplace are sometimes hung with the portraits.

In addition to portraits visits by the leadership to homes and workplaces are memorialized with plaques. These memorials are generally placed above the door with photographs displayed on the leadership wall. These plaques can be alone honoring a visit of Kim Jong-il only.

Portrait worship in North Korea is similar to the older Shinto tradition of hanging the portrait of the Emperor of Japan in the home. Extraordinary feats of saving the portrait (or sculpture) in the time of disaster are also seen in North Korea. These practices were once very common in Imperial Japan.

Or are do they truly believe the outside world is horrible, as their propaganda suggests? what about all the food that's available? that has to be more food than they've had access to, or are they kept away from the olympic village?

This list contains non-fiction books that are intended for anyone with an interest in learning more about North Korea. Let's help spread knowledge about North Korea.

For each title, a brief description can be provided (feel feel to comment and I'll add). I want to keep objective descriptions that will allow redditors to know if the book fits their interest - not a review of the book (leave that to amazon, goodreads, redditor review posts etc.). For example I'm listing *Nothing to Envy* by Barbara Demick as the best book for newcomers with no background knowledge at all on North Korea - due to its fantastic narrative, rather than dense history and analysis.
**In addition, please feel free to make a thread with a review of a recent book you've finished for all other redditors to benefit from.**

Could it be possible that Kim Jung Un and those advising him have not noticed the massive change in attitudes in recent years?  Is it possible that he does not understand the fact that South Korea will not back down this time?  He probably has noticed that his threats are not being taken seriously this time and that explains his continual ramp ups in threats, it seems like he is trying to scare his way into a handout.  What happens if there is no handout to be had because South Korea and the United States have had enough and are openly willing to call his bluff (B-52 and B-2 flyovers, etc).  Since Kim Jung Un's rule is new and he was almost assassinated last year in downtown pyongyang and is now in the camp of the hardline generals, can he politically afford to back down?

TL:DR Does Kim Jung Un recognize the unique situation he is in, and is there a politically viable (for all parties involved) solution for this that doesn't result in war?

I want to share a few of these. 

This one I took at the Wonsan Railway Museum. This is another one of those revolutionary shrines but when I saw one of the guides a bit worn out it was tempting. The optimistic Kim Il-sung youthful and looking forward and the tired guide, older. Is the revolution growing old?

This photo was taken in the morning in a park. Many people drink and morning hangovers are common. I suspect this man has a hangover. In comparison to the weird light fixture it shows societal contrast.

The granite of the Kumsusan Memorial Palace is a vast gray wasteland. The area is huge. People are small in the eyes of the state. I always try to capture the small people in contrast to the huge buildings. 
BTW this is where Kim Jong-il is lying in state.

One of the ironies of the DPRK is the devotion to production and the displays portraying bountiful harvests or societal advancement. 
This photo is from the Arirang Mass Games and it depicts a pig. The fish in the background are dancing. The irony is that the food situation in the North is always critical yet the mass games portray a land of plenty.

It seems like this would be in their long-term interest.  Although a buffer state isn't as necessary as it once was, I would say that it still contributes to regional stability.  They would get to keep their buffer state, while also being somewhat of a hero on the world stage for ending the oppressive Kim regime.  They have the military (and a surplus of males) to get it done.

Would a Chinese-led coup be too bloody considering the North Korean military's power?  Would a Chinese-installed government be unable to hold onto power?  Would the US and South Korea keep this from happening?  While a western-allied unified Korean Peninsula would be the best outcome for the West, I really don't see China allowing this.  And I feel like a Chinese-backed buffer state with a Chinese-style economy would be a huge step up from the status quo; much better for China while also better for South Korea and the West.

Also some DPRK banknotes. The bank notes set was 20,000KRW (about 19.80 Australian Dollars) and its from 1992 so not sure how current they are. Worth noting that the money has marks on it and small stains so I think its been in use.

While all the other tourists (mostly americans) were buying up all the american military paraphenalia, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to get a little piece of the DPRK for myself :)

Over the weekend I found what looks to be an interesting board game simulation of a new war on the Korean peninsula. There is a physical game, but it may also be played using Vassal on your computer.

I've read the rules and, while somewhat complex, this does look to be an interesting tool to simulate military scenarios above the battalion level between the DPRK/ROC/US/PRC. Advanced rules seem to get extremely detailed.

Hoeryong Concentration Camp
North Hamgyong North Korea‎
Map of the business location


Quality Good
The people in the camp were amazing. i even had to kill one or two. will certainly visit again.



Quality Excellent


Very friendly staff. They corrected my eyesight by butt stroking me in the head with their AK-47. It was a lucky break, since they broke my glasses. I've had better raw pigeon, roots and ants in other camps, I was not impressed. I did lose weight, about 30 lbs, but that was mostly from the dysentery and scurvy.

Quality Excellent

I couldn't believe that they met me at the airport and had a chauffeur waiting to take me to my destination. We went through a measly 19 check points, 5 detention centers which held me up to 3 days each. That part wasn't bad at all, i can appreciate a country with such amazingly high security protocols. They even have a retinal scanner on the shitters! Now that's security! No worries now Larry Craig, you shan't tap your toe at me! Shortly after the detention centers I was loaded up in a caravan with other visitors who were doing the ""surprise package."" They were handcuffed and blindfolded, what an experience for them! Such luck! Well, as for me, I went with the cheaper tickets which is called the ""sudden surprise"" package. They got about a mile away from the detention centers and hit me in the head with a butt stock of a rifle. So when I awoke I was SURPRISED! There was security everywhere and a half million employees waiting on me hand and foot, some who didn't even have hands or feet! What luck for them! They get to dote on what they miss! Suffice it to say, I was released a decade later after my tickets home were processed. I have to say, the mud floors, cement beds and rice 'n water are a nice new addition. Apparently they have been used to sleeping on dead corpses for a nice soft bed to lay on. If it wasn't for the bread being stale I would recommend a second visit, but hey, they all can't be perfect concentration camps!",,False,self,t5_2r16c,False,,,True,t3_17k539,http://www.reddit.com/r/northkorea/comments/17k539/reviews_about_n_korea_labor_camps_on_google_maps/,

I am currently living in Hawaii. 
Having grown up on the streets of Chicago I have found Hawaii to be an amazing place to live and Most of my family has moved here to join me.
In the last few years I have lived in Mexico City as well as lived in Costa Rica and visited El Salvador.
While living here in Hawaii I have found joy in my South Korean friends and I have been intrigued by North Korea and its relationship with its family in the south. 
My job now allows me to save enough money to go and experience these places first hand and I would like to move forward with plans.
Few Facts about myself.

* typical white American, 5'11, 220lbs.
* I do not speak any foreign language other than basic Spanish. Will this be a problem and how fluent should I be before I go? 
* I have a budget of $2,000 but I can delay trip if more money is needed
* I am interested in History, politics, economy, religion and ideology.
* Not interested in filming or taking very many pictures.
* I would like to see if at all possible anything form old Korea such as ruins or buildings.


Few questions.

* How accessible is internet?

* Are gifts allowed to be given to locals, tour guides, children? (Half the fun I have is giving a little child something amazing or sweet.)

* Will I be in any danger normally?  as an example I have felt my life threatened on multiple occasion while in Mexico, Costa Rica, and El Salvador.  It is my understanding that I would mostly be watched at all times while out and about and that criminals would not be a problem.

* I have been recommended to use youngpioneertours.com or http://uritours.com/ as they seem to do most of the paper work and such. Any recommendations or personal experiences with these companies? 

Last but not least... If their are any groups going that see this, let me know as I would gladly buy in and help with the trip. 
PM Me!

Much Love and Aloha,

I figured someone new coming here might want a post with a large quantity of North Korean related books to read.

Here is what I've read and intend to read.

*links added after posting to avoid spam filter.

• [Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten Years in the North Korean Gulag](http://www.amazon.com/Aquariums-Pyongyang-Years-North-Korean/dp/0465011047/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-7)
Good account of a young boy who was imprisoned with his family.

• [The Cleanest Race: How North Koreans See Themselves and Why It Matters](http://www.amazon.com/Cleanest-Race-Koreans-Themselves-Matters/dp/1933633913/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-4)
Great book on the DPRK ideology of how they see the world.

• [Inside North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Inside-North-Korea-Edward-Harris/dp/B0030ILWOW/ref=sr_1_31?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747654&amp;sr=8-31) This is a photo book, but still very eye opening. Similar photos can be found on Flickr [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mytripsmypics/sets/72157604812751507/with/4702113719/) and [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/samgellman/sets/72157627661307874/with/6146441285/).

• [Escape from Camp 14: One Man's Remarkable Odyssey from North Korea to Freedom in the West](http://www.amazon.com/Escape-Camp-14-Remarkable-Odyssey/dp/0670023329/ref=sr_1_22?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747654&amp;sr=8-22)

• [Escaping North Korea: Defiance and Hope in the World's Most Repressive Country](http://www.amazon.com/Escaping-North-Korea-Defiance-Repressive/dp/0742567052/ref=sr_1_16?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-16)

• [The World is Bigger Now](http://www.amazon.com/World-Bigger-Now-Journalists-Forgiveness/dp/0307716139/ref=sr_1_30?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747654&amp;sr=8-30)
Not very good, based on Euna Lee and Laura Ling's capture when they crossed the Yalu River into NK. Mostly about how hard it was to get through with the uncertainty they were given as prisoners.

• [Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Nothing-Envy-Ordinary-Lives-North/dp/0385523912/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-1)
Gives a more human aspect to the citizens of NK. Talks about good and bad times, and paints it as a famine, rather than an oppressive state. It still relates the issues as the fault of the government, but the escapees come to realize it, rather than observers.

• [Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty](http://www.amazon.com/Under-Loving-Care-Fatherly-Leader/dp/0312323220/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-2)

• [This is Paradise!: My North Korean Childhood](http://www.amazon.com/This-Paradise-North-Korean-Childhood/dp/0349118655/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-6)

 This is a non fiction graphic novel, by a French Canadian who worked with an animation studio in NK.

• [Eating with the Enemy: How I Waged Peace with North Korea from My BBQ Shack in Hackensack](http://www.amazon.com/Eating-Enemy-Waged-Peace-Hackensack/dp/B004IK9EDM/ref=sr_1_21?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747654&amp;sr=8-21)

• [Witness to Transformation: Refugee Insights into North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Witness-Transformation-Refugee-Insights-North/dp/0881324388/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-15) 

• [Comrades and Strangers: Behind the Closed Doors of North Korea](http://www.amazon.com/Comrades-Strangers-Behind-Closed-Doors/dp/0470869763/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-14)

I haven't read this, but I have heard of him. Very eager to start.

• [The Hidden People of North Korea: Everyday Life in the Hermit Kingdom](http://www.amazon.com/Hidden-People-North-Korea-Everyday/dp/0742567184/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1319747332&amp;sr=8-10) 

Two more found by ohwhereohwhere, descriptions in their words:

• Eyes of the Tailless Animals Eyes of the Tailless Animals - A book about a woman that lived a fairly comfortable life, but was forced into prison camps after she refused to take part in official corruption. It's a very personal memoir, but I found it to be a good read.

• Somewhere Inside By Lisa and Laura Ling. I read this before I read ""The World is Bigger Now,"" and they're two very different books. Laura was a tool for the North Koreans during their captivity because of the connections she had. Her boss, Al Gore, was able to involve the State Department and ultimately led to Clinton's rescue of them. This is more political and less emotional when compared to Euna Lee's book. I found it quite informative.",,False,self,t5_2r16c,True,,,True,t3_lrcy1,http://www.reddit.com/r/northkorea/comments/lrcy1/a_reading_list_maybe_for_sidebar_addition/,

Certainly when traveling, customs officers would ask where you are going and what your plans are. It isn't like you can simply cross the border between North Korea and South Korea, and it seems that most tour groups to North Korea go through China, but China would probably be asking what your plans were if you weren't in a tour group?

I know the backstory of the production, how it was supposed to be China until they realized that they China's box office numbers are essential to making money, but the whole premise seemed ridiculous.  

They kept mentioning (and showing) the help they received from the Russians, but Russians becoming that sympathetic to North Korea's hatred of the US is just as implausible.

Also, it didn't help that all of the digitally inserted NK flags looked like they were done on Photoshop 1.0 - but that's other story. 

But, as one reviewer pointed out, if the US can't successfully occupy these small nations in the middle east, how the hell can we fear a country the size of North Korea taking us over?

Hear me out then down vote please.

Un must have been heavily influenced by the west from his childhood in Switzerland. He had seen what lives people have in the west and unlike his father and grandfather who were more like Stalin.

He can't just step down, he cant just transfer his power to someone else, because he'll be killed only to be replaced by someone else and be worshiped again.

So he chose the most effective way to erase his family legacy. Let his regime be destroyed completely externally. So no one would be over to take over and be another Kim Jong the fourth.

I say this because again he's seen the life outside of nk. He can't possibly be so blinded to think all his threats towards the U.S is even remotely plausible. He's asking for suicide. And once nk is gone, it'll be rebuilt by South Koreans and he's likely ok with that.

We all know that Northkorea may have nuclear-capable bombs which are their main weapon, at least they say so. What is sorrowing me the most is that people still have no clue about the situation. Kim Jong Un lived for about 10 years in switzerland studying and living. 
He knows the western culture. He also knows that the western culture is far more advaced than his little country. And he also knows that he will have no single chance against the United Nations.

So, what are his goals?

I for my part am a german. My country is seen by Koreans, north and south as their destiny (symbolic). They want to reunite, but have despite from the same language the most diverse culture between brotherstates that exist. Also did Northkorea and Southkorea establish on a border from war. Unlike the old inner-german border. I think they are totally wrong by this. We germans needed more than 100 years to form a state. But we were no enemies. We were sovereign. 

Why are People from Northkorea and Southkorea thinking they are comparable to the two germanies?

The current situation with Northkorea and the Rest of the world is very tense but also solid. There may be no turning back. And this is my controversial thesis. I do not know many integration programs of the UN, but i sure now that the ones in Northkorea did not work. The abandon of the same industrial site was the latest proof. My thought now is that, the people of the UN should intervene. Meaning that they should stop the dictature in the North. 

I am awaiting criticism.

There now exist drastic differences between the facts an average North Korean believes to be true and what is factual.    

Before North Korea can become an open society the realities of the world (technological advancements, the wealth other countries have) must be admitted to, with whatever spin.    

I believe a very useful herald of an attempt by NK leaders to rejoin the rest of the world will be internal propaganda changing to reflect the reality of how people in other cultures live.    

I think the present attempt to present Kim Jong Un as a technocrat is a really good sign.

Kim is spewing all this rhetoric in order to reinforce his position as a leader in the eyes of his military command. What if UN agreed to play along with Kim to make him a powerful leader in exchange of opening relationships with South Korea?

Basically we (UN) agree to keep him on the throne as long as he cancels nuclear programs / opens trade with the South / allows workforce exchange / students from the north studying in the south etc. So Kim would have power but all his power comes from the UN, not from his generals. UN would get to use him as a sock puppet in order to relax the regime and gradually prepare for reunification.

There are no annoying YouTube ads in this channel, and there never will be (YouTube channel settings permitting).

The channel has collected a year’s worth of view statistics since I [announced it](https://plus.google.com/116475614487294923810/posts/U2WpsAJYgWf) at the beginning of the year. I’ve added the videos that I think are most interesting to a western audience to the featured channel.

Ask about view statistics (which videos were most popular in which countries and for which ages and genders), how the automated upload system works, the implications of DPRK copyright law, and about my favorite YouTube comments in the channel. I’ll also link to a few videos that might be interesting to DPRK news connoisseurs (but not necessarily to the general public) in the comments below.

North Korea, for the past month has been ramping up its rhetoric and directly threatening the US, South Korea, and Japan with nuclear holocaust. The media isn’t helping as it is clearly cashing in on piqued public interest and using all the buzzwords to scare you into paying attention. Yet US and South Korean leadership have remained very calm and mum on the subject. No public safety tips have been issued, no air raid drills have been practiced, and the military aren’t being called back into duty. So are we heading down to the biggest “I told you so” blunder of the millennia or is Kim Jong Un (KJU) the fattest kid that’s ever cried wolf?
If you’ve seen pictures of KJU, then you know it’s the latter. Simply put, North Korea is NOT going to invade or attack the US or its allies anytime soon in the foreseeable future. 

THE US GOVERNMENT AND ALLIES KNOW INFORMATION ABOUT NORTH KOREA THAT WE DON'T

North Korea is probably one of the most closely monitored countries in the world. The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is the asshole neighbor on the block that all of the neighbors despise. Hence everyone keeps keen telescopes on everything the North Koreans do. The US and its allies use all sorts of monitoring techniques to check what the North Koreans are doing including satellites, planes, electronic surveillance, and a whole slew of stuff we don’t know about. While key preludes to war are different from country to country, a general list of some of the key indicators are:

1.Deployment of key Main Battle Tank (MBT) divisions and units to staging areas. The backbone of any modern army are MBT units. They are the heavy hitters and defenders of any land army and are essential in any large scale conflict. These are like the knights, rooks, and bishops, of your chess board and they will not sit out in any conflict. Lose these guys and essentially your fate is sealed. That said, all militaries have contingency plans for every situation and will have planned staging areas for forward deployment of their units. These will be large fields and assembly areas that these units have trained and drilled on several times every year to make sure they know exactly where to go, how to get there, and do it quickly. If you don’t see these key MBT units in assembly/staging areas but sit in their home garrisons, then likely no large conflict is going to be happening. In addition, moving MBT divisions is very costly. An American M1 Abrams take consumes approximately 10 gallons of fuel just to start up and will consume 1.6 gallons per mile and 10 gallons per hour just idling. Therefore deploying an entire division of several hundred MBTs will be VERY costly on fuel alone – something the DPRK is already low on. 

2.Recall of military reserves or conscript of civilians. If you got to a large destiny-changing conflict, you’d want to conscript your citizenry. If you are going to war with your long hated neighbor(s) and it’s goliath of an ally that’s also the most powerful country the earth has ever known, you’d at least call on your reserves. Since on-the-ground information is so rare in North Korea, it’s hard to monitor this. However, calling on its reserves would mean thens of thousands people leaving their homes and traveling to military garrisons for equipping, training, and orders. The simultaneous travel of this many people in a short time would have an observable impact on the DPRK’s transportation. Furthermore, military garrisons receiving this influx of personnel would show significant increased activity. Barracks once empty would become habited, targe numbers of personnel would be training on fields, tents and temporary shelters would be erected to accommodate them.

3.Strategic assets would be mobilized and deployed in launch positions. Any nuclear capable country on the cusp of imminent war would first and foremost secure their own strategic assets either in hardened shelters to defend against enemy strikes or be on launch positions ready to fire. Long range ballistic missiles with nukes are extremely expensive and require a lot of engineering, support, and luck to hit its target. They won’t be launched from just any place but rather purposeful built launch pads and areas to ensure their success. The launch areas will have perfectly measured out heights, distances, and lots of weather and wind data collected over years. These are locations monitored constantly by the US and allies. Furthermore, the DPRK’s Tapedong 2 missiles are liquid propellant missiles. Liquid propellant means that they require a liquid propellant and an oxidizer. These missiles are not normally stored with propellant and oxidizer loaded and need to be “gassed up” before launch. A missile fully loaded with liquid is extremely heavy to transport, is susceptible to explosions due to temperature variances, and the chemicals are highly caustic and corrosive. Gasing up a missile can take several days and would be difficult to hide.

All of these indicators are closely monitored by the US and allies including ones not on this list. This is probably why the US and allies have been relatively calm despite the escalating rhetoric employed by the North. There’s a significant difference between talking the talk and walking the walk. One is more dangerous than the other and so far North Korea hasn’t done anything that can’t be undone. Close down Kaesong Industrial region? Done it several times before. Cut communication lines with the south? Done it before. Missile launches? Nuke tests? All done before.

ALL WAR IS DECEPTION

If a country really wants to go to war with another country, they don’t announce it, they just do it. Preferably they would start at night or in the early morning when everyone is sleeping and unaware. All war is deception and the less the enemy knows about your intentions, the better. Want to attack? Publicly sue for peace. Plan to invade on a Tuesday? Make it appear you are doing so on Thursday. Attack from the north? Move your troops east. Never, ever, under any circumstances let the enemy know that you are coming. The rhetoric that the DPRK has been using for the past month has been slowly building in intensity and frequency. The consequence of which is that the area is on the most heightened security defense posture in several years. The US has sent the USS John S. McCain and USS Fitzgerald, two guided missile destroyers in to the area. Japan has deployed anti-missile systems and destroyers in the region and vowed to shoot down any North Korean missile. The South Korean military too have been deploying anti-missile batteries and its military is on heightened alert. If the North Koreas were planning on launching a missile at anyone, this is probably the worst time to do it if they want the missile hit anything.

In the end, everything is just a lot of talk, posturing, and fanfare. It’s hard to tell why KJU is throwing yet another hissy fit since there’s no direct information into the hermit country. Maybe he’s afraid of a coup and needs to solidify his stance as the figurehead of the country. Maybe he needs to show actual military prowess to gain respect. Either way, if you want to start a war, there needs to be measurable gains that you think you can gain from it. The brass in the North aren’t dumb enough to know that they can cross the DMZ and sweep the South through sheer force and they know they can’t land a nuke on US soil. Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.

That said, this is a dangerous game the KJU is playing. Increased posturing on the North’s side is met with the same on the South since no one wants to be caught with their pants down regardless of how credit-less the claims of war are. The mutually aggressive stand-off leads to a climate where skirmishes could easily precipitate willingly or unwillingly. Will there be all out war? Probably not. However when everyone’s on edge and have their guns pointed at each other, an itchy trigger finger could turn small mistakes into large skirmishes. The worst case scenario from this entire standoff are small isolated border skirmishes that will undoubtedly lead to casualties on both sides and that would be defeat for everyone involved nonetheless.

1365309189.0,4,self.northkorea,1bu5ft,A possible economic savior for Korean Unification: Asian Highway 1. (x-post from /r/korea by /u/djp06475),Tenal,5,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/northkorea/comments/1bu5ft/a_possible_economic_savior_for_korean_unification/,"As of late, there's been a lot of talk about the possibility North Korea's government getting dissolved, either by war or internal resistance. However, there's been some concern about what the effects would be should North Korea cave in this manner. One of these effects would be a downturn of the South Korean economy, due to the fact that most of North Korea is under-educated based on social status. What would we do with all of these new citizens, who will be most definitely unemployed? While it seems like there are multiple paths to take, there is a path that seems quite feasible: the full connection of Asian Highway 1 (AH1).

**BACKGROUND:** Asian Highway 1 is a [12000+ mile highway](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Highway_1) that runs between Tokyo, Japan and the Turkish/Bulgarian border. It runs along the East Asian/Southeast Asian coastline, then up through India and the northeast Middle Eastern region into Turkey, where it joins on the E80 that already connects the western part of Europe with the eastern part. This highway makes it possible to drive directly from Tokyo to Lisbon, Portugal without taking major detours or back-roads. It is possible to travel the length of this highway now...sort of.

You'd have to worry about two different obstacles: the first is geographical. There have been talks, which have died down as of a few years ago, between South Korea and Japan regarding building a [120-mile tunnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan%E2%80%93Korea_Undersea_Tunnel) under the Sea of Japan. Estimated costs of this project have zeroed in around $90 billion USD, which is no small feat even for two countries that have among the largest national economies in the world. There have been some concerns regarding the true economic benefits of this project. However, the project has been formed considering only these two countries in mind. A united Korea, though, may see the rewards quite well. But this is only a part of the solution, which I will connect this to later. The other obstacle is, of course, political. You can't just *drive* through North Korea. [The highway is already there, mind you; it's just not connected to the borders.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reunification_Highway) Once this section of the Korean Peninsula is opened up to the outside world, there will be a logistical need to connect China and South Korea/Japan.

Now at this point I know what you're thinking. *That's stupid and unnecessary. Why drive cargo through North Korea when you could just fly it directly to China or put it on a boat?* That's actually a valid question, and there's an even better answer to that: environmental impact. Yes, we know of global warming and the gasses that are spilling out of our exhaust systems. But driving a semi up the peninsula can be as environmentally friendly as [flying](http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/transportation_and_global_warming/airplane_emissions/index.html) or [floating](http://www.autoblog.com/2009/06/02/report-pollution-from-15-of-worlds-biggest-ships-equal-that-o/). And not only do you have cars and trucks; you also have [trains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maglev) to transport goods. Money may be the trump factor in getting AH1 built, but the way we're treating our planet in the process deserves a look over as well.

If you've [seen](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/~oh20j/classweb/images/highway.jpg) [photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mytripsmypics/3222625894/) [of](http://www.lindsayfincher.com/gallery/d/21638-2/dprk_reunification_highway_21.JPG) [at](http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/spl/hi/picture_gallery/05/asia_pac_unseen_north_korea/img/2.jpg) [least](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mytripsmypics/6314796686/) [the](http://www.photosfan.com/images/north-korea-countryside-roads1.jpg) [roads](http://farm7.staticflickr.com/6019/6301871351_0d0c62970f_z.jpg) in North Korea, you can tell that North Korea is in *dire* need of an infrastructure facelift. Only a small percentage of roads in North Korea are paved, and the ones that are paved now will probably need to get repaved or rebuilt from scratch, especially that highway. These changes are going to take a lot of people to fix. Do you see where I'm going with this? ***The best way to handle the sudden influx of unemployed North Koreans is to have them fix the highway.*** Now before we start diving into costs, consider this: you're going to have **a lot** of people working on this highway. They'll need people to:

- design the new highway/rail system.
- build the new highway/rail system.
- train the builders.
- develop materials needed for highway/rail system construction.
- care for the workers and their families, in the forms of food, health care, schools, etc.
- monitor and maintain the highway/rail system after construction is completed.

This is only part of the project. Remember that tunnel I was discussing earlier? The very same things are going to be needed as well for that project. If there are people left over from the infrastructure upgrade in need of work, *send them there*. With the right plans and mindset, unemployment will be majorly solved, and when the highway opens, transit will come through and businesses will start spreading out in the areas where they were not able to go before. It's essentially a situation where everybody wins.

Now this plan has its possible obstacles. The primary obstacle, again, is the monetary cost. It's common for people to want things, but cease pursuing them if they determine that the cost of it is too high. Tolls, tariffs, and other miscellaneous duties would probably cover a chunk of the cost, but some of it still, as well as the initial payments on these projects, rest on the major countries involved to pay up. At this point, it'd take a miracle for everyone needed to get on board, but if they did, then the other obstacles such as political adjustments and societal psyche will seem, at most, modest to handle.

Just an idea on how to solve the issue. But man, it'd be cool if it actually happened.

At whatever time that the enmity ceases, and the country opens up, it might be smart to - as a laboratory of sorts, limit the use of these endocrine disrupting chemicals. By understanding the effects of caloric restriction and freedom from heavy exposure to endocrine disruptors-  we all, everyone, on our whole planet, might be able to live longer and healthier. Scientists could look at North Koreans who had been living on less food, and (possibly, but again, maybe not) around fewer chemicals for a long time and perhaps find a lot to learn that would help all of humanity live longer. 

So out of a bad thing, something good might come. Its a really unique situation because humans and animals almost everywhere else are (possibly) exposed to more chemical poisons.

Pyongyang, April 10 (KCNA) -- The Fourth Media, a website of China, on March 31 posted an article titled ""Present international situation is being decided by the DPRK.""
The DPRK's possession of nukes radically changed the structure of confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S., the article said, and went on:
The U.S. experienced only a shameful defeat though it has long made desperate efforts to stifle the DPRK.
The U.S. is now at a loss what to do, being taken aback by the DPRK's declaration of all-out actions.
The U.S. has introduced into south Korea the strategic bombers, one of its ""three nuclear strike means"". Its aim is to attack the DPRK straight away but chances were against the U.S. So they went back to its original place just like a paper tiger lowers its tail.
The U.S. made big bluff before the world only in vain.
This is the present situation of the DPRK-U.S. confrontation.
The present global situation depends on the DPRK.
Mounting high is the will of the Korean people to settle accounts with the U.S. by giving fullest play to everything that they have obtained in the last period by their devoted efforts while tightening belts.
Gone are the days when nuclear powers could command the international situation.
The DPRK, a real new power, is leading the trend of the globe.
It is the DPRK, not big powers like the U.S. which holds control of the international situation.
With the tightened showdown with the U.S. the DPRK is forcing the U.S. to face a final judgment.
