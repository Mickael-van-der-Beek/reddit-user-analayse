This is the 2nd news org that posted it and the CNN news guy only took one camera thus confirming nothing.

If you would be willing to do this, please take the cameras point them at the sky line from the same approximate location but separated by apx 100ft (if you can measure it we can get more info about the situation but its not required to prove or disprove this).  This will give us a triangulation on the location this is happening.   We can then time sync both cameras and determine if this is localized (ie bugs) or distant.   If we have the appropriate measurements we can also determine things like airspeed, size and exact 'landing' locations.

Thanks!


**Edit:**   Phyridean, Agnostix, and Monst  have all graciously stated they will try this out.  I believe they are coordinating with each other.  Give them love in the comments below reddit.  For sweet sweet Science!

**Edit 2:** Agnostix is organizing.  PM if local and available.  Also seems at least one person will be there Saturday at noon.

**Edit 3:** A relatively large group will be at 84th and federal 11:30am/noon this Saturday.   Let us know guys and thanks again for the effort!

**Edit 4:**  I've asked a few of the participants to PM me their links after they're done.  I will update this post with the link to whatever they find be it reddit posts or just youtube vids.  Either is fine for me.

**FINAL UPDATE**  All further information will be gathered here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/13da3k/this_is_the_denver_ufo_meeting_followup_post/

Here's my experience.,WaterSnake,407,81,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/wv7sx/i_was_at_century_16_tonight_heres_my_experience/,"My girlfriend and I went to see the Dark Knight premiere. We were in theater 16. About 15 minutes in I heard a hissing noise coming from what seemed like far away. I passed it off as someone moving a trash can or something. 2 minutes later and the fire alarm went off. It said ""There has been an emergency in the theater. Please evacuate"". People were getting mad, and I thought someone just pulled the fire alarm to be a prankster and ruin everyone's night. As we got into the main lobby, everyone started coughing. It was difficult to inhale, and it didn't feel like regular smoke (I now know this was from the smoke bombs he set off). There were some people sprinting around me, but for the most part everyone was kind of quick walking. When we got outside, I could see someone pointing at his leg and saying ""The firework hit me, right here"". There were maybe 2 or 3 police cars at this point. After some more waiting around, we saw a police officer run towards the building with a shotgun. My girlfriend and I thought that now would be a good time to wait it out in my care. We sat in the parking lot for maybe 30 minutes and watched the cop cars pour in. People were beginning to leave, but I didn't want to get caught up in the jam, so we stayed put. The police had formed a perimeter around the building. We moved to try and get closer to the exit. The police had started going through cars with a flashlight. We moved into the line of cars. We saw vans and trailers begin to enter, with one marked ""Command Center"". The cars were showing no signs of moving. After a while, a helicopter with a search light showed up. People were coming back from the road in droves, trying to leave, I assume, but the police wouldn't let them. Finally, around 2:45 MST, the police began going down the lines of cars with a flashlight and letting people go home. 


It's the most police cars I've ever seen in my life, and I was terrified the whole time. Luckily, my girlfriend was more chill, but she was still pretty worried.

 I'm still pretty shaken up and it's late, so if it's not the most polished piece of literature, I apologize. 

Uh, and AMA I guess.

EDIT: Wow, thanks for all the responses. I just went to bed after posting this, so sorry I couldn't get to your comments earlier. 

I do have some shitty photos of the place that I had texted my friend. I can upload them (not super interesting) and maybe give some (not much) proof that I was there. Sadly I left my ticket in the theater, or else I'd post that.

We stopped recording around 1:30 PM and promptly went for pizza across the street (thanks, Blackjack Pizza!). 

There were at least 4 quality cameras running for the entire time, spaced at least 30-100 feet apart. 

This post is being created as a way for those who showed up to come together to share your captures.

I personally want to thank everyone who showed up. It was a great time. Let's now analyze and report our findings. 

I'm currently sorting through my hour+ worth of HD footage. I'll post a link to raw video ASAP, even if it's unremarkable, so that fellow redditors can do their own scrutinizing. 

*Fox 31 actually showed up today and interviewed us.* They apparently caught wind (pun intended) of our meeting and sent a camera guy to cover the event. It will air tonight on the Saturday evening news broadcast. 

I will be going out again over the course of the next week or two to video some more. Anyone interested in joining me, just PM. 

In case you're wondering, no we didn't see any UFO's. THERE WAS A LOT OF FLIES, however. I actually have a great clip of a huge fly landing _right on my camera lens_ before ""activating it's thrusters"" and flying off.

Stay tuned to this post for that clip and others from those who joined me. 

Thanks again!! 

EDIT: I found our first [""UFO""](http://i.imgur.com/AZ4j6.jpg). Sarcastic quotes used on ""UFO"" because it's a fly. They were everywhere. 

EDIT 2: And BAM - I just found the [money shot](http://i.imgur.com/LD6Df.jpg). I believe this is all that's needed to bolster the bug hypothesis. 

EDIT 3: ~~I just got Halo 4 and am off to play it until my eyes bleed~~ I'm heading out for the night...but my computer is currently uploading about 30 minutes of unedited video to youtube. It won't be live for another few hours (it's 4:30 PM now). I'll post a link when it's done - feel free to scrub it for UFOs yourselves!!

EDIT 4: **Holy bickering redditors, Batman!** Let me make something clear: our footage so far does not *PROVE* anything. I called it the 'money shot' because it shows the presence of multiple flying insects in an area where the original KDVR reporter said there were not many bugs at all. All our footage so far shows is that the KDVR reporter is a typical, sensationalizing mainstream media journalist who has been proven wrong about her description of the area in which the original UFO footage was captured. 

EDIT 4 redux: I'm headed out to the site today around 11:30 and will be using my brand spankin' new 255mm zoom lens to get some really good mid-field video. Feel free to join me! As for the youtube link...mother %*#(-ing power went out at my condo yesterday evening so I'm having to restart my original uploads. Thanks for your patience. I'll get the link out soon. 

EDIT 5: Nothing remarkable came from my shooting yesterday (Sunday, 11/18). I have the first 5 minutes of my footage from Saturday uploaded to http://youtu.be/U3V0BI7yR4c . Apparently I have to chop up my videos into 5 minute increments to meet YouTube's upload policy. Lame. Anyway, I'll continue to post each 5 minute clip as I get them processed. If you see anything I didn't catch, please let me know and I'll timestamp it and correlate with others who were shooting at the same time.

I saw the Walkmen mon night at the Ogden (which was great) and met a couple people at the pub after. I walked home by myself, reasonably drunk, around one. I live on Pennsylvania and the walk is about seventy five yards.  I believe these guys scoped me out at the bar and then followed me out the door.  They hit me in the back of the head with a pistol, when I fell they held the gun to my head and stomped my face into the curb as they took everything from my pockets.  I am not large (5'9 155), but I am very fit, but no one has a chance against three guys with a gun who rush from behind.  This was on the front step of my house.  I have spent the last few days dealing with police and doctors and banks and trying to score a phone, and now my jaw is wired shut, and will be for the next five weeks because it has major fractures in two spots, not to mention the dental work needed when they unwire me.  But I'm still alive and I'm gonna take some time off work to go visit my little nieces and nephews, you have to count your blessings, right?

The moral of the story is:

DONT WALK HOME BY YOURSELF IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

NEVER WALK HOME DRUNK BY YOURSELF THROUGH ANYTHING LESS SAFE THAN SUBURBIA.  KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU, STAY IN GROUPS AND TAKE TAXIS.

I would also like to add that i was carrying a knife, but it didnt matter, nor would have mace.  They rushed me so quick and it was over so fast I didn't have a chance.  The best personal protection is not putting yourself in a situation where that might happen.

This is a major problem for any food cart who caters to the bar crowd--we do 80-90% of our business after midnight--and without the ability to sell after midnight we will be out of our jobs and out of our investments.  

We need your help, r/denver, getting the word out that this rule needs to change and that Denver needs late night street food.

You can call or email Denver City Council Woman Judy Montero @ 720-337-7709 (judy.montero@denvergov.org) and tell her why LoDo need late night street food.

Any other suggestions about how to go about changing this would be greatly appreciated.

TL;DR No more street food in LoDo if conditions of Vendors permits are not changed.

My name is Jay and I am the owner and only employee at Golden Acre Farm.  GAF is a small farm located at the east end of North Table Mountain out in Golden.  We donate a portion of every harvest to the JFS Weinberg Food Pantry and focus on matters of social justice, food equality and sustainable living. Please check out my website, www.goldenacrefarm.com, for more details.

I just wanted to let everyone know we will be at the Highland Farmer's Market every Saturday morning from 9am-1pm, June 1st - October 12th.  The market is located on Boulder St. in between 15th and 16th.  We have a few slots available for our CSA (look for info on the website) and we hope to see all of you out at the market!

EDIT:  I should also mention that I am also the Director of Operations at Ekar Farm (www.ekarfarm.org).  Ekar Farm is a 501 C 3 non-profit where we donate 90% of all the food grown on our farm.  Last year we donated over 10,000 lbs of food over 7 months, keeping 2,500 people fed each month!  Ekar is located on Alameda in between Monaco and Quebec.  Since we are a non-profit we are short staffed and always need help with farm work.  If anyone is interested in volunteering for the organization please feel free to e-mail me at jason@ekarfarm.org for more information.  

EDIT 2:  Thank you all so much for the interest in the farm and in Denver's wonderful emerging local, sustainable food movement!  If you have any questions ask away or you can ask me  through e-mail as well.  Best of luck to anyone growing their own food this season!  Hope to see you all at the market!

The snow hit just as my daughters gym class ended. Unperturbed I parked up at King Soopers in Centennial to do my groceries and when I came back out laden with shopping and two hungry and chilly kids, my car battery was flat. Dead. Kaput.

So, now I have a car going nowhere, no coats or blankets, and two cold and scared kids.

I tried a few friends on my mobile, but no one was in or answering their phones, then my network dropped out.

I got out of the car (in a t-shirt and jeans) and looked under the hood to see if there was anything I could do.

The guy parked in the space in front of me got out of his car to check what was up. He too had a flat battery and was waiting on a friend to come and give him a jumpstart. 

When his friend arrived, they tried to start my car first, but it was completely flat and we thought maybe the alternator was gone. They offered me a ride and a coat, but I didn't have anyway to get the car later, even if I called a tow.

I spotted an old Brakes Plus sticker on the car and called them from the superstore (they let me use their phone!) as I knew they were just across the block from where I was. The guy on the phone was very sweet and when I explained I had the kids with me and no coats etc, he offered to come over to the car park to see what he could do.
He brought his own jumpstart pack, but the car was still completely dead.

He drove us over to the garage waiting room, gave the kids candy and drinks, me coffee and obviously most important - access to the restroom! He then went back over to the car park to fit a new battery and drove my car back to me at the shop.

Missing person posts are not allowed on reddit unless they link to credible news source, or unless the person can be verified as ""Missing"", by the legal definition, by a law enforcement agency. A Facebook page is never sufficient evidence to allow these posts on reddit. 

**This is a reddit rule and not an /r/denver specific rule.**

With a recent missing person post I spoke with an administrator of this site, noting that it seemed fairly credible and he re-affirmed that it cannot be allowed here. In addition, with a recent MP post, I searched google for a credible source, checked [CBI](https://www.colorado.gov/apps/coldcase/search.html?type=MISSING) and called the associated police department to see if the person was listed as missing. They refuse to tell me that unless I have the person's DOB, which no one who posted here was able to provide me.

I am sure the OPs of these posts had the best intentions, but there is good reason for this rule and it would be irresponsible for me not to enforce it.",,False,,t5_2qn3i,False,,,True,t3_1337q7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1337q7/a_note_regarding_missing_person_posts/,moderator

My heart and prayers go out to you. As an experienced Alaska and Colorado structure and wildland firefighter I want to remind you that there is much you can do right now that will greatly increase the chances of your home surviving this fire. When the fire hits your neighborhood the fire department probably will not be there to save your house; there are not enough trucks and crews. They will choose a house or two to defend and the rest will be at the mercy of luck, God and the fire. Here’s what you need to do to defend your home: Clear all debris from you roof and gutters. Sparks and “firebrands” will land on your roof; if there are pine needles and twigs to burn that often is all that’s needed to set your roof on fire.

Clear all dead and dry brush and grass away from your house; the further away you clear the safer you are. Nothing flammable should be right next to your house including wood mulch. If I still lived in the Springs I’d be taking out the hedges and rose bushes near the house. Stacks of wood, trash, lawnmowers, etc. need to go away. Be 100% thorough. Mow everything within 10-15 feet of your home. Rake the dead stuff right next to your home. It will get very hot for quite awhile and those green leaves will turn as dry as paper and then eventually burn.

Trees are now your enemy and may cost you your home. Cut down spruce trees that overhang or are right next to your home. Cut off all low dead branches.

Be smart about where you put debris; expect it to be very windy when your neighborhood burns over.

Clean your decks and carports; just pile things in the garage for now. Put the extra car or boat in the garage or away from the house.

If you live on a hill realize that fire spreads more quickly uphill.

Find your photo albums and prized possessions; load them in boxes, ready-to-go on a moment’s notice (or just load them in your car right now). Back up your important PC documents on a flash drive or portable HD; put it in the ready-to-go box.

Currently, millions of dollars in resources are being withheld from the some 44,000 students in this school district.  The motives as to why the district is doing this are not concretely known.  

Last December, a neutral fact-finder was selected to audit the district's finances.  It was then found that the district had underspent the budget by tens of millions of dollars every year since 2007, and then ignored this situation when creating next year's budget.  For whatever reason, the district is not using its taxpayer dollars on its students.  The link to this report can be found [here.](http://www.adams12.org/files/boe/Fact_Finding_Report.pdf)

Instead of investing in these kids, the district has decided to the following in the past years:

* cut middle school sports
* cut course offerings; for example, middle school students cannot take a French class (they can only do so in high school)
* cut Outdoor Ed
* increase the walk distances so that more students are walking further to/from school when they could be bussed
* increase student fees; students must also pay to ride the bus
* class sizes are becoming too large; I teach a mix of 32 freshmen, sophomores, ELL and SPED students at the last hour of the day (I can hardly ever give ALL students individualized attention in this time)
* reduce the number of campus supervisors; the building I work in serves 1800 students and we have only three campus supervisors 

Please help by spreading the word about this situation.  Fox 31 News is airing an investigative report about the Adams 12 School District this Monday through Wednesday (Feb 4-6) at 9 p.m. each night.  I have an image from [Fox 31's Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/fox31denver) that you are more than welcome to share on your own Twitter/Facebook/Instagram/what have yous.  The image can be found [here.](http://i.imgur.com/gBP6Imx.jpg)

Please help me spread the word by sharing this if you can.  My students do not deserve this and the Denver community needs to know what is going on in its public schools.  Thank you so much in advance.  

And no I don't secretly work for Fox News haha :)

EDIT 1: Formatting.

EDIT 2: I just want to be clear that when I mention the Board of Education I am specifically referring to three of its five members: Mark Clark (president), Norm Jennings (VP) and Enrico Figueroa (director).  Dr. Fred Schaefer (director) and R. Max Willsey (secretary) have come out against the actions of Clark/Jennings/Figueroa.

Yes.  With the passing of [Amendment 64](http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/s/regulate-marijuana-alcohol-act-2012) marijuana possession of an ounce or less has been made legal in the state of Colorado for people 21 years of age or older.

**I don't live in Colorado, do these laws still apply to me?**

Yes.  It is legal for anyone within state boundaries to possess and consume cannabis provided they're over 21 years of age.  Once retail stores open in 2014 visitors to the state will be limited to purchasing a quarter ounce at a time, but they may still possess a full ounce.

**I'm not 21 yet, is there any way to smoke legally?**

Yes, but only as a [medical marijuana patient](http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Type&amp;blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3D%221001.pdf.pdf%22&amp;blobheadervalue2=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1251827349871&amp;ssbinary=true).  If you are under 18 years of age you will need the [Medical Marijuana Application for Patients Under 18 Years of Age](http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&amp;blobheadername1=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Type&amp;blobheadervalue1=inline%3B+filename%3D%221002.pdf.pdf%22&amp;blobheadervalue2=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobwhere=1251827349749&amp;ssbinary=true) and parental consent.

**So now that it's legal I can just go out and buy it, right?**

Wrong.  Retail stores won't open up until 2014 and the law is written so that the only legal way to sell marijuana will be through these retail stores.

**Then how am I supposed to get my marijuana?**

You can grow your own marijuana, up to 6 plants per person with 3 plants mature.  This is a policy up to the homeowner's discretion, so if you're renting a house or an apartment you will need to check the lease/landlord to ensure you're allowed to grow.

You can also try to find someone who's willing to give you marijuana for free. The text of the amendment clearly allows for marijuana to be given away freely.

**So I can't buy any weed?**

Legally, you can buy marijuana. But legally, no one can sell it to you.  Even with legalization there is a very active black market for marijuana.  You could always try to find some stoners or [look on Craigslist](http://denver.craigslist.org/search/?areaID=13&amp;subAreaID=&amp;query=mmj+64&amp;catAbb=sss).

**Now that I've got some cannabis, where can I take it?**

You are allowed to possess marijuana most anywhere in the state of Colorado.  Private businesses and residences may choose to disallow people from possessing it on their property, but they'll just have to ask you to leave.  Possession on all Federal property is still illegal, this includes federal office buildings, federal courthouses, national parks and national forests.  The city of Greenwood Village has also enacted legislation [barring possession/transportation of marijuana in all public spaces, including roads and sidewalks](http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_22500645/greenwood-village-ordinance-test-pot-legalization-law).

**What if I live in a college dorm room?**

Sorry, but you better keep and smoke your marijuana elsewhere.  Colleges and universities across Colorado have been uniform in saying that marijuana possession or use on campus — in the dorms and elsewhere — [is not allowed](http://www.denverpost.com/headlines/ci_22134383). Even if you're over 21 and legal under state law to possess marijuana, you could still face school-code-of-conduct charges for possessing marijuana on campus.

**Who cares about simple possession, where can I consume my cannabis?**

Consumption of marijuana is legal in Colorado in ""private"".  The only place this clearly includes is inside private residences (with the homeowner's permission).  Boulder is so far unique in legally defining ""private property"" as [any part of a residential property](http://www.dailycamera.com/news/boulder/ci_23039897/boulder-approves-pot-use-adults-private-property), even if the neighbors can see/smell the smoke (such as a backyard).  In other cities and towns this may be okay, but it's not explicitly legal.

Businesses may allow on-site consumption if they're not a marijuana retail (it's illegal to consume marijuana at any place that sells marijuana, barring Amsterdam-style coffee shops) and are closed for a ""private event"" or operate as a ""private club"" with membership fees.

You can't smoke while walking down the street or playing in a park or driving your car.  You will probably see people smoking out in the open but they're not doing so legally.

**Is my personal car a private space that I can smoke in?**

No.  Unless your car is parked in your own garage while you're in it, it's illegal to consume cannabis in any vehicle.  Cannabis in Colorado also follows the [open container law for alcohol](http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics/clics2013a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/4B75534D3719DBD687257B490074E195?Open&amp;file=283_01.pdf). An ""open container"" of cannabis may not be carried in your car unless it's stored in your trunk -- even a locked glove box is not sufficient.  An open container described as ""a receptacle that contains any amount of marijuana and is open or has a broken seal, or the contents of which are partially removed.""

**I've just consumed cannabis, can I drive?**

Probably not.  The [legal limit](http://www.statebillinfo.com/bills/bills/12/1325_01.pdf) for THC in Colorado to operate a vehicle is 5ng/ml of blood.  Many habitual smokers are at this limit without even smoking in the past 12 hours.  If you are pulled over and they suspect you are under the influence, they may request a blood test.  Legally, you do [not have to consent to a blood test](http://dui.drivinglaws.org/resources/dui-refusal-blood-breath-urine-test/colorado.htm) but it will result in the automatic loss of your license for at least a year.

**Can I take cannabis with me outside of the state?**

No, with some minor exceptions.  If you're flying to Washington, [you can take marijuana with you](http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2012/11/marijuana_tsa_flying_colorado_washington.php).  If you have a red card and are flying to a state that honors our red card, you may also take marijuana with you.  States that allow medical marijuana reciprocity are Maine, Michigan, Montana, Rhode Island and Arizona.

**Now that marijuana's legal, can my employer still drug test and fire me for use on my own time?**

Yes.  The amendment explicitly states that no part of the amendment is intended to affect the ability for employers to have policies restricting the use of marijuana by their employees.

**How much do things cost?**

Currently, an ounce of marijuana costs about $200 on the black market.  Retail prices are expected to mirror the black market prices but with additional taxes.  In November Colorado voters will be voting on a [proposed 25% tax rate](http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/colorado-senate-passes-house-bill-1318s-25-marijuana-sales-tax).

**So why would folks even bother with a medical marijuana red card?**

As mentioned above, a red card allows someone to legally smoke before they're 21.  It also allows for the legal possession of up to two ounces instead of one.

For the first time in 103 years we have had to stop all movement on dogs in our shelter due to a recent pneumonia outbreak affecting Denver and some surrounding towns (see article below). For the next 30 days, we are unable to take in or adopt out any of the 263 dogs in our care at the moment. Rest assured these babies will be spoiled rotten during this time, as our adoption staff have 8 more hours a day to dedicate to walks/play time/plain old love.

Although we are all over the news, please dont forget that this is not just affecting the Dumb Friends League and other Denver shelters. This is a community outbreak, meaning some daycare or boarding facilities may be affected as well. It's best to keep your pets from these facilities until the outbreak has died down. Ask neighbors to watch your pets, look into dog walking businesses - heck even call the DFL for references, as I know many of my co-workers have pet sitting jobs on the side.

Also, if you could do us a favor, please let people know this is JUST affecting our dogs. We still have 600 lovely, sweet, adorable, homeless cats that could use a warm bed to sleep in at night. Cats, small mammals, and equines are still available for adoption! If you're looking for a dog, dont forget there are a number of amazing shelters in surrounding cities (Boulder, Longmont, etc) that are still adopting out dogs!

**Resistance**

Your city is laid out like a grid, even on the outskirts, which helps coordinate defense considerably. There are a fair number of hospitals, a high amount of gun ownership in Colorado (Especially in the surrounding countryside and inner city). The interstates would pump freshly infected for only a brief while before they are shut down. Backroads are easily patrolled by military units, with clear lines of sight from block-to-block, making it comparatively easy to fortify the central city.

Food and fuel is your number one concern. Your city is ranked 6th in wind power, nation-wide (Congrats!) Solar and other renewable sources will help, too, because you *will* run out of fuel for coal-fired plants rather quickly.

Assuming you shut down offices' power, the outer residential areas' power, and other unnecessary locations by keeping your grid online, (unlike many other places in the country) and if your local Government does a good job, you likely have enough power to run essentials such as water treatment for a time while also keeping a crackdown on the few inlets into the city.

You aren't immune from forest fires, especially with roads essentially shut down, but with a scorched-earth policy for the fire and to give it nowhere to go and a vigilant eye, you could create a dead-zone for the summertime fires to keep it away from the city.

Denver Airport will have to be cut-off. It is too far out, runs past an interstate  (and that's vein of infection if there ever was one) to get to, and in general is hard to defend. You're on your own, but with enough forward thinking, hydroponics or getting clever with rooftop/office/public space gardening, you may well weather it out until a Summertime wildfire wipes out the zombies for thousands of miles around you, at the cost of any lone-wolf survivors who have managed to survive until the wildfire hits.

**Downfall**

If food doesn't last, if there's just too many infected, or if there's poor leadership, then I suggest moving from place to place and just trying to pick off and thin out the herd with reusable weapons, such as a concrete brick suspended via rope/pole across the street, with a rope to pull it back and let it go like a pendulum to pick off zombies in the streets below. Perhaps when a fire hits, you can hope diffusion gets the zombies to spread out thinly enough to re-establish a battle line.

**Outer ring:**

Denver is in near-constant danger of wildfires in the Summertime. 

Assuming the apocalypse hits in the Winter and you don't have to deal with ill-equipped refugees trying to camp out in the woods (creating a fire), you've still got to hold out until the Summertime, when lightning strikes can start a fire. With most of your fire department turned or early alert system gone, assuming the central city has held out, a raging inferno will bear down on the city, *completely* unchecked. You may have only a brief warning before it's move-or-die. Any crops survivors are trying to make will wither, some will suffocate, and more will burn.

I do not have any metric for what would happen to the center city, but the outskirts are *done* for. Roads are nigh-impassible, with tons of highways and backroads. Your one shot would be to reach the center city the moment things go tits up, or to enact whatever backup plan you have to get out of there.

by Josh W on Friday, July 20, 2012 at 10:54am

Theater 8

I woke up on the morning of July 19th with an excited smile. I was going to see the new Batman movie, The Dark Knight Rises. I woke with Noemi next to me, and immediately began searching through our clothes for our Batman t-shirts. We were getting each other amped up for hours, reading Batman comics, watching the trailers – even playing Batman video games. Our excitement could no longer be contained, so we took our pre-printed tickets and left for Century 16 six hours before the show would begin. As we drove we talked of the scenes from the trailers and tried to plot bust the final film before we would see it. We walked through the doors smiling wide, looking at all of the people bearing the black and yellow symbol of The Dark Knight across their chests. We fiddled with a machine scanning our tickets unsuccessfully for several minutes before finally getting help from a cashier. As soon as our tickets came we walked in disbelief over to where they’d roped off an area for people to sit and wait, excited as children on Christmas morning. We were finally going to see our hero rise for the final time. I frantically kept checking my ticket stub, fearing it would disappear if I didn’t check that it was in my pocket every few seconds. I couldn’t stop smiling as I looked at it. Dark Knight Rises showed in bold letters across the top with House 8 directly below. We purchased our tickets at 7:14, and waited impatiently with wonderful people in line. We were the third and fourth people there in line, and couldn’t be happier. Shortly after we arrived we met a very nice and VERY excited guy (we later learned his name is Alex), and we talked for a good two hours. Everyone was friendly, excited… and smiling. We were counting down the minutes to when we’d finally see our hero again. To our surprise the doors to the theater opened around 9:35, and I was ushering Noemi to grab her purse and hurry behind me so we could get our usual seats. We like being at the very center of the middle row – perfect movie seats in my opinion. As we parted ways from our new friend from the line, he called, “see you after the movie!”

As usual the trailers began, and we cheered as trailers for The Hobbit, and Man of Steel played out on the screen. Excitement rippled through the theater as usual quiet commentary echoed around the room of mixed opinions. Everyone’s cheers and whoops fell into dead silence as the screen showed Commissioner Gordon giving his piece at Harvey Dent’s funeral. From that moment on the room was silent, and enjoying the show. Our excitement grew steadily as new characters were introduced, and the story began to unfold. We were taken to the story of a cop, and into the middle of a harsh action packed gun battle. Suddenly it was as though the movie was no longer a movie, the chaos on the screen had manifested itself into the very room. At first the sounds of what I thought to be cheap fire crackers didn’t phase me. Smoke billowed around the right side of the theater where people had previously been entering. This still didn’t phase me. I was determined to ignore the asshole interrupting my film, I wasn’t going to let fire crackers ruin my night. Noemi gripped my arm, worried, looking closer. Suddenly I snapped back to reality. I felt pieces of grit hit my face and arms. A series of further pops echoed with the movie’s scene of grim gun fire, and more “smoke” billowed around the right side of the room. It didn’t occur to me until later that it was not smoke, or at least not just smoke. It was debris showering into the room from bullets coming through the walls. Our shared wall with theater 9. Screams could be heard over the roar of the movie. I took Noemi by the hand and led her down the isle with everyone else trying to get out. Some stayed in their seats in disbelief, even defiant – not willing to leave their seats. A man in a white shirt rushed into the room as the fire alarms went off, “don’t exit through the front, there’s a man out there shooting people.” The only light in the room came from the big screen, showing enough in the dim light to send my body shaking with fear. As the sounds of groans and moans of pain became more coherent around us we realized people were injured. Even if we couldn’t spot them in the darkness, we could hear them. The shooting continued, barely audible over more screams. Finally, as though a switch of understanding struck me along with everyone else we began rushing back up the stairs towards the exits above at the top level – not the ones we came through. Noemi and I rushed out onto the bright and loud balcony level overlooking the main lobby. We were in the middle of what seemed like a war. Police officers with shot guns and pistols rushed below and out of sight while others guarded the stairs up to our level, ordering us to get down behind the wall. People rushed out through the front doors holding wounds, or doubled over in agony. I grabbed Noemi and pulled her behind me down the stairs, reassuring her as best I could. She pushed me away, yelling for me to run, but I grabbed her anyway and stayed with her on our dreamlike way out the front doors, completely in disbelief, fearing a bullet could tear it’s way through us at any given second. I don’t remember seeing many of the wounded, we got out quickly in the chaos of it all. The red and blue lights were as welcome as the Bat signal in the sky then, and I knew we were going to be okay. We moved well beyond the line of cop cars, knowing it should be safe. I walked up to a young boy, maybe my sister’s age with blood caked over his hands. I asked if he was okay, if he was hurt… It wasn’t his blood. He helped one of the wounded out of the building, and explained that the man had been hit pretty bad through one of his legs. The boy was holding up better than I was, he said, “I’m angry more than anything else, who does this? Who would do something like this?”

I shook my head, unable to reply. Childish guilt and shame welled up inside of me. I wanted to go back, to help. I looked at Noemi and shook off the ridiculous feeling. There was nothing I could have done. I took her in my arms and made phone calls to family letting them know what had happened, and that we were okay. Rumors of a death passed from person to person. My world was shattered. I had to get her out of there. Without hesitation she led me back to the car, and I drove us out of the parking lot behind a line of cars trying to escape the massacre. Sirens cut through the air as countless police cars and ambulances rushed past us. The fear deepened as I saw this. I wanted answers. How many people were injured? How many had been killed? Did I know any of them? I still don’t know if I do know any of them. I am shaking as I type my story now, recalling what happened. 9 news plays the details as I type now. Twelve dead, around fifty wounded. It is nearly ten o’clock in the morning. Ten bodies still remain inside of the theater. If we hadn’t purchased our tickets in advance, or arrived for good seats five hours before the movie… would we have been in the seats where people were being hit with bullets and debris from the walls? I don’t know. What if we’d been in theater 9 instead of 8? Would I be alive to tell you my story? I don’t know. I never saw the man who shot up theater 9. I heard he was dressed in black, and wore a gas mask as he used a rifle and two pistols on helpless innocent people. Men, women, children. Children. Cute kids dressed up as the caped crusader or the infamous back breaking Bane. There is no justice that can be brought to James Holmes. He deserves a fate worse than the most agonizing death can offer. I want to see him burn alive, I want to hear him scream for what he has done. I will never forget what I witnessed just ten hours ago. Is it wrong to feel guilty for getting away unscathed? If I could trade places with any of the twelve, I would in a heartbeat. None of them deserved this. We live in a world plagued by villains. Batman was everywhere that night, defeated. Our heroes are the brave officers offering their lives on the line to protect us..",,False,,t5_2qn3i,False,,,True,t3_wwfns,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/wwfns/batman_aurora_mall_shooting_survivors_account/,

Possibly even some that have been around for quite some time.

Historically, this city has its share of seedy, underground musings... the Chinese opium dens, underground tunnels for moving booze and politicians and social elites, the conspiracy theories behind DIA (OK, maybe I'm reaching with this one), etc.

So, even if it's not something as dark or demented as the the previous examples provided, I'd like to hear your input, Denverites, on existing underground cultures! It would be so cool to further explore parts of Denver, those that aren't apparent at the surface.

Until next time. (I don't think Hickenlooper can even reintroduce it at a special session like last year. It's just *that* dead.)

You can thank senators:

* Lundberg, who found the limit to be too low and risks false positives

* Aguilar, who believes exemptions must be made for mmj patients and those incapable of performing field sobriety tests

* Ulibarri, who argued the bill fails to improve law enforcement's ability to convict and that it is unfairly discriminatory

* Guzman, who acknowledged that users cannot know their blood THC levels when sober

And, last but not least:

* The esteemed Senator Steve King, who was incompetent enough not to have actually read his bill (that he introduced for the 4th time), such that he failed to explain why an interlock breath-testing device should be installed in a vehicle after any THC DUI conviction. *""Wait... what's in my bill? That shouldn't be there...""*

Congratulations!

Yes, I remember the [Mile High Music Festival](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mile_High_Music_Festival) from a few years ago that never really caught on, but that may have had to do with it being held at Dicks rather than City Park, [as it was originally intended](http://www.denverpost.com/music/ci_17533323).  

I think we need to bring it back, and hold it downtown.  If City Park is off of the table because of the zoo, why not try something different?  I haven't been to a ton of festivals, but it seems like most contain the festival in one big park.  I went to the Summer Music Festival in Quebec City that did something interesting; rather than have multiple stages in one big park, it spread them out over multiple smaller parks that were within easy walking/transit distance from each other.  We could have stages at Confluence Park, Civic Center, somewhere on 16th, and maybe Wash Park or Cheesman (other possible places: Elitches, Auraria, indoor venues, etc). That would distribute people throughout the city, and cut down on some of he hassles of huge crowds in one big park. To go between them, you could emphasize bike-renting, RTD, or shuttles.

Am I the only one who thinks a festival like this by summer 2014, with Denver's weather and in time for the marijuana retail stores to be up and running, would be huge?

We set up our move through a national company called Father and Son Moving, which then contracts out to local movers, in this case, King Moving and Storage. We confirmed our move date almost two weeks in advance and paid a $100 deposit for our move on Friday 6/28. The day before the move, King called to confirm for a morning move. I had to remind them that we had been set up for an afternoon move. This was my first contact with King and I should have taken it as an omen. Luckily, they had scheduled a lady for an afternoon move who had actually wanted a morning move, so they just switched us. Crisis averted, or so I thought.

We were told that our move window was 2-4pm. At 1:30, we received a phone call from King telling us that the 6 hour move from the morning was going to be a 12 hour move, they would be unable to get to us, and they were going to have to move us first thing the next day. Really? They offered us 5% off because of this inconvenience. I asked for 10% and the representative told me he couldn't do that. I called Father and Son to discuss the situation and they were able to get us the extra 5%, although I was still mad about the situation. I called King and told them that the next day would be fine. I was told that we would be moved first thing in the morning and the move window was 6-8am. I asked, since we were first, if we could get a more set time and I was told that they have to give a two hour window because they don't know what traffic is going to be like. I didn't think traffic would be an issue at 6am on a Saturday, but I reluctantly agreed.

My girlfriend and I were up and at the apartment at 6am. Then we waited. And waited. And waited some more. At 8:05 I called King. I was told that the movers HADN'T EVEN ARRIVED AT THE OFFICE and that he didn't know when they would be getting there. I didn't receive a phone call or anything from King to let me know. I had to call them. The dispatcher on the phone seemed flustered and I asked him to call me as soon as the movers arrived and were headed our way.

10am, no call. I called King and nobody answered, so I left a voicemail. 10:30am, I called again and nobody answered. 11am, I called again and nobody answered. At this point I wondered if they were screening their calls so they wouldn't have to talk to me. At 12:15 my girlfriend called from her phone and somebody answered (suspicions confirmed about them screening calls). She explained the situation and asked what the plan was. Silence on the other end. She even had to say ""are you still there?"" The dispatcher then said that he would get a manager, at which point they hung up on her.

At 1pm I called Father and Son, the ""parent"" company and spoke with a customer service representative. She was very apologetic about the situation. She contacted someone at King and told me that I should receive a call within 10 minutes from them. I did not. After 20 minutes I called her back, at which point she tried to have her manager speak with me but he was busy on the phone and she said that he would call me in 10 minutes. I confirmed with her that I could get my deposit back if I canceled, which she said I could.

I got a call back from the F&amp;S representative telling me that King had a truck available and they were on their way. I told her not to bother and that I wanted to cancel.

The whole thing was a debacle. Luckily, we didn't schedule our move on the last day of the month, otherwise we would have been completely screwed. The biggest frustrations were that King didn't honor our original contract, didn't honor our rescheduled move, and blatantly refused to talk to me about why any of this was happening or to let me know what was going on. 

I will never use this company again.

EDIT: TL;DR Moving company doesn't honor contract for scheduled move, doesn't honor rescheduled move, doesn't call to inform customer of anything that's going on.",,False,,t5_2qn3i,False,,,True,t3_1higbb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1higbb/warning_dont_use_king_moving_and_storage_in_aurora/,

Typical long time lurker here, coming out of the shadows when he needs something. 

My finance and I are in Denver for the week, and we love it so much we have decided to elope this Friday. The one thing we always wanted for our wedding was to create an 8mm film of our day. No secondary audio, just images of our love for each other and the environment we are in. 

I have found a great camera from Ebay that I can pick up locally, but I have hit my head against the wall trying to find super 8 film. No one carries it, and I no longer have time to have it shipped, as we are doing a sunrise ceremony at red rocks park on Friday. 

If anyone has any, or knows anyone who has any, I would happily pay a premium for it, and of course pick up. 



Reddit, after hours of fruitless searching and phone calls, you are my last hope.

**MORE TIPS**

**According to AAA**

* During non-emergency situations, you should apply the brakes in the same manner whether you have ABS or not, and the vehicle should respond in exactly the same way. When you're coming to an “ordinary” stop, you should not be braking hard enough to activate the anti-lock braking system.

* During emergency situations, when you're trying to stop in the shortest distance possible, you should just step on the brake pedal as hard and as fast as you can. Do not pump the brakes! If your vehicle has ABS, pumping the brakes will not help you in any way, and can even be counterproductive. Just step on the pedal and let the electronics “pump” for you

* Of course, the best way to use your ABS is by not having to. Keep your distance everyone.

**Some tips from The Weather Channel**

* Driving in Snow and Ice

The best advice for driving in bad winter weather is not to drive at all, if you can avoid it.

Don't go out until the snow plows and sanding trucks have had a chance to do their work, and allow yourself extra time to reach your destination. 

If you must drive in snowy conditions, make sure your car is prepared (TIPS), and that you know how to handle road conditions.

It's helpful to practice winter driving techniques in a snowy, open parking lot, so you're familiar with how your car handles. Consult your owner's manual for tips specific to your vehicle.

1. Driving safely on icy roads
1. Decrease your speed and leave yourself plenty of room to stop. You should allow at least three times more space than usual between you and the car in front of you. 
1. Brake gently to avoid skidding. If your wheels start to lock up, ease off the brake. 
1. Turn on your lights to increase your visibility to other motorists.
1. Keep your lights and windshield clean.
1. Use low gears to keep traction, especially on hills.
1. Don't use cruise control or overdrive on icy roads.
1. Be especially careful on bridges, overpasses and infrequently traveled roads, which will freeze first. Even at temperatures above freezing, if the conditions are wet, you might encounter ice in shady areas or on exposed roadways like bridges.
1. on't pass snow plows and sanding trucks. The drivers have limited visibility, and you're likely to find the road in front of them worse than the road behind.
1. Don't assume your vehicle can handle all conditions. Even four-wheel and front-wheel drive vehicles can encounter trouble on winter roads. 



**If your rear wheels skid...**

1.  Take your foot off the accelerator. 

2.  Steer in the direction you want the front wheels to go. If your rear wheels are sliding left, steer left. If they're sliding right, steer right. 

3.  If your rear wheels start sliding the other way as you recover, ease the steering wheel toward that side. You might have to steer left and right a few times to get your vehicle completely under control. 

4.  If you have standard brakes, pump them gently.

5.  If you have anti-lock brakes (ABS), do not pump the brakes. Apply steady pressure to the brakes. You will feel the brakes pulse — this is normal.

**If your front wheels skid...**

1.  Take your foot off the gas and shift to neutral, but don't try to steer immediately. 

2.  As the wheels skid sideways, they will slow the vehicle and traction will return. As it does, steer in the direction you want to go. Then put the transmission in ""drive"" or release the clutch, and accelerate gently. 

**If you get stuck...**

1.  Do not spin your wheels. This will only dig you in deeper.

2.  Turn your wheels from side to side a few times to push snow out of the way. 

3.  Use a light touch on the gas, to ease your car out.

4.  Use a shovel to clear snow away from the wheels and the underside of the car.

5.  Pour sand, kitty litter, gravel or salt in the path of the wheels, to help get traction.

6.  Try rocking the vehicle. (Check your owner's manual first — it can damage the transmission on some vehicles.) Shift from forward to reverse, and back again. Each time you're in gear, give a light touch on the gas until the vehicle gets going.

And a more recent update: http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1h7ggr/current_uptodate_status_on_the_cuernavaca_dog_i/

The dog has been taken to a shelter and was made available for adoption just a couple days ago....but due to her age and some health issues (not for sure what they are), there's been no takers.  She has till COB today or she'll likely be put down.

This dog, I've been told, is a sweetheart, and with the life of neglect and abuse she's likely lived, she deserves to know what love is and have her last years spent in a caring household.

I WILL PAY ADOPTION AND ALL RELATED FEES IF ANYONE CAN ADOPT HER.  She is a poodle mix and is currently at the Denver Animal Shelter.

Dear Redditors. I sought help for the first time in my life from strangers. I am usually th giver, not the receiver of such charity. I have a puppy who got hurt and I couldn't pay to get her the help she needed. I am a single mom, a drug and alcohol detox and rehab nurse, and a giving, loving person. I take care of my 3 sons, and heroin addicts who need help and as well as love and understanding in the same day. I help anyone anytime even when I am not asked. I humbled myself to ask for help for this little puppy and by my surprise it came!
I received a message from a fellow redditor (username: Silent_R) who offered to pay for her care. I was shocked and skeptical. I rushed to the vet and they called my anonymous benefactor and he did exactly what he promised. I cried and cried when I realized my new friend was real. 
I owe him everything. My heart will never be the same after the kindness he has shown me. I will do my best to repay him every penny, but I will never be able to thank him enough. He made my little puppy whole again. And he gave me back my faith in humanity. 
I wish you all the happiest holidays. And I wish him to most wonderful life imaginable!

It’s been 3 days and I’ve yet to see any media outlet compile a bio of everyone on Hickenlooper’s Marijuana Task Force.  So I gave it a go.

I’m biased.  But my biases are only through the scope that I believe Colorado can have a marijuana industry as fruitful, widespread, highly-specialized, and internationally celebrated as our craft beer scene.  (After all, didn’t we vote to regulate marijuana like alcohol?)  If you share my same outlook, I encourage you to try be active in the rulemaking process.

The way the news was reported, it gives the impression that the interests of everyone on all sides of the legalization issue are appropriately represented by the Task Force.  This is absolutely not the case.

Despite Amendment 64 passing with more YEA votes than any US President or politician Coloradans have ever cast their vote for, the majority rule of the Task Force is comprised of people opposed to the measure.  I hope to demonstrate this within each participant’s bio so that we may be wary of the direction taken by the Task Force.

I am unfamiliar with many people on the Task Force.  Of those with whom I am familiar, I tried to support my anecdotal experiences with Googleable citations.  ~~I’ll start with the “friends” and move on to the “foes”:~~

*******************

**TL;DR:**  (I'll just put it up here) On the surface, this Task Force appears to be a grand gesture on Hickenlooper’s part for genuine compromise.  In reality, the Task Force's proportional representation is opposite the will of Colorado voters.  On November 6th, the “Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol Act of 2012” passed overwhelmingly.  We voted to regulate marijuana like alcohol.  We have a working alcohol regulatory structure that need only be reapplied to marijuana.  The sole purpose of this Task Force is to deviate from the model you and I voted for.

If, like most 9-5ers, you are unable to participate in the rulemaking hearings (the first of which is Monday at noon), I urge you to contact the members of the Task Force.",,False,,t5_2qn3i,1355436104.0,,,True,t3_14t23k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/14t23k/hickenloopers_marijuana_task_force_who_are_these/,

1355865541.0,80,self.Denver,152kmy,First Meeting of the A64 Task Force,BlackbeltJones,97,17,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/152kmy/first_meeting_of_the_a64_task_force/,"**TL;DR:** I did the lion's share of editorializing in [my last Task Force post](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/14t23k/hickenloopers_marijuana_task_force_who_are_these/).  Below, I list all the issues brought under consideration without assigning the name of that issue's sponsor.  The ideas can speak for themselves, positively or negatively.

This first meeting was a brainstorming session.  My overall opinion?  I wasn't that optimistic going in, but I'm even less so after the meeting.  For a group of people thinking out loud for 45 minutes, they seemed to lose sight of identifying ""practical and pragmatic solutions,"" the primary objective of the Task Force as laid out in Hickenlooper's press release.  ""Reinventing the wheel"" may be a [gross understatement](http://meblogwritegood.files.wordpress.com/2011/07/screen-shot-2011-07-21-at-3-33-40-pm.png).

**THE POSITIVES:**

* All A-64 Task Force meetings will be public.  NOTE: They're NOT at the Capital!  They're at the CO Dept of Revenue ""Gaming Board Room"" 17301 W. Colfax Ste. 135, Golden.  (And just because it's in Golden doesn't mean there's anywhere to park).  The next meetings will be held from 1-5pm on Jan 7, Jan 12, Feb 5, Feb 19, and if necessary, Feb 28.

* All Task Force meetings should allow for at least 30 minutes of public testimony.   (Caveat: if the Task Force operates like the state legislature, decisions will be made within non-public subcommittee meeings, and public testimony will be a perfunctory exercise prior to a final vote that's already been decided upon.)  Depending upon the volume of public testimony, the Task Force Co-Chairs may begin requiring people to sign up in advance on the Department of Revenue website.

* To maximize input and minimize testimony, the Department of Revenue is going to create an email address designated specifically for public comment and inquiry.  Co-Chair Barbara Brohl assured participants that the emails would be forwarded/printed for the members of the Task Force.  In the meantime, before the new Inbox is established, all inquiries can be directed to Mark Couch, the Task Force press liaison, at **mark.couch@state.co.us**

* While the Task Force membership is closed, the procedural by-laws allow for additional, at-large members of the community to be assigned to subcommittees at the discretion of the co-chairpersons, should they choose to entertain those requests or acknowledge an individual's particular expertise.

**THE MEETING:**

All members of the Task Force were in attendance except John Salazar, Commissioner of Agriculture, who delegated Ron Carleton from the Ag office as his proxy.

The chairpersons distributed binders to all the members which were not for public purview.  The binders included a committee contact list, an estimate of A-64's fiscal impact, and a state map 
identifying geographical areas where dispensary bans and other restrictions are currently in place.  The binders also included the [full text of A64](http://www.regulatemarijuana.org/s/regulate-marijuana-alcohol-act-2012), current statutes pertaining to [Medical Marijuana regulation](http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite/CDPHE-CHEIS/CBON/1251593017076), the [Ogden Memo](http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/medical-marijuana.pdf), the [Cole Memo](http://safeaccessnow.org/downloads/James_Cole_memo_06_29_2011.pdf), as well as a general statement that Washington State, not having previous experience with a medical marijuana program, will be looking to Colorado's example to help implement their state's legalization effort, Initiative 502.

**PROCEDURE:**

The Task Force will ""strive for consensus"" regarding all policy matters.  ""Strive for consensus"" was clarified to mean the attitude: ""will this work, even if I don't necessarily agree with it?""

If consensus cannot be reached, the Co-Chairs can call a vote:

Approval of procedural issues requires a majority vote of the people in attendance.

Approval of policy or ""issues of substance"" requires a majority vote of the Task Force.

There will be no additions to the Task Force membership.  Additions *may* be made to any subcommittee, including members of the public, at discretion of the Co-Chairs of that subcommittee.

The Task Force will be divided into 5 subcommittees.  These subcommittees are charged with creating an efficient regulatory structure, changing regulations when necessary and forwarding recommendations when legal revisions must be made by other authoritative bodies (Governor, Atty General, Legislature, etc).  The subcommittees are:

* Overall Regulatory Framework

* Tax/Funding and Civil Law Issues

* Local Authority and Control

* Criminal Law Issues

* Consumer Safety and Social Issues

**THESE ARE THE ISSUES TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE TASK FORCE**

Westword blogger Sam Levin published the Task Force's [powerpoint presentation](http://www.scribd.com/doc/117184305/Amendment-64-121712-Taskforce).  The Department of Revenue identified legal/policy issues and the committee members added to it.

&gt; Be able to improve/amend these regulations with fluidity

**PEANUT GALLERY &amp; PUBLIC TESTIMONY**

&gt; Plea for members to tour dispensaries or grow operations; ""See the businesses you're decisions will impact."" (Six Task Force members began to raise their hands, having never been inside a dispensary)

&gt; Oppose DUID- setting a minimum nanogram limit defines impairment without determining impairment

&gt; Plea to reassure local governments of the progress of the Task Force and not rush into local bans

&gt; Dissolve the MMED altogether. Simplify licensing requirements and classification.

&gt; Regulating THC content of cannabis buds is absurd when edibles and oils can be so highly concentrated. Poses that Task Force members are unknowledgeable.

&gt; State-operated dispensaries would trigger DOJ interference for expressly violating the ""positive conflict"" clause of the Controlled Substances Act

&gt; The Governor or Department of Revenue should put out a press release defining exactly what is currently legal for Coloradans

&gt; The Feds will come after banking.  Colorado needs an in-state exchange and insurance system to move the black market over to a legal market.

&gt; Upset that there are no card-holding marijuana patients on the Task Force, only industry representatives

&gt; Loose regulation will minimize the black market.  Suggests Task Force members may not be willing to acknowledge ""the sheer amount of marijuana available"" that is out of their control.

&gt; Affirm employee rights in Colorado; address marijuana and medication in anti-discriminatory laws regarding physical disabilities and handicaps

&gt; Create laws determining what happens at the airport

&gt; Follow the alcohol model that allows for Colorado's generous craft beer market  *(a man after my own heart)*

&gt; Ease plant count and patient count regulations

There was no flyer, sign or any notice that a marathon was closing Logan, let alone 13th. As I walked to breakfast I saw cars in so much traffic that people had turned them Off and were standing outside of them, some were even abandoned.

I think it's absolutely insane that local residents weren't warned ahead of time. Obviously Denver has no money, and wants to encourage these events. But can we legally require any event that will shut down he area we live in to notify us? Even putting flyers on telephone poles would have been better than what we got, which for a lot of people was a ticket and a tow, or 5 hours of standstill traffic...",,False,,t5_2qn3i,False,,,True,t3_10ccmz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/10ccmz/should_groups_like_the_rock_and_roll_marathon_be/,

Anywho, I was reading another forum and I realized I'm not the only geeky girl that has trouble making non-guy friends.

Are there any females in /r/Denver that would be interested in a girls-only happy hour? (Seriously, no guys, alright?) I don't have anything particular in mind, I just figured I'd start a discussion. So.... discuss. :)

edit: So there's a decent amount of interest. Could people do something soon? Like this Friday? Or should we plan for further out so people could make it? 

edit 2: Ok, so I'm thinking something less formal this Friday. Happy Hour downtown somewhere (and yeah I work, but people can always meet earlier too, lol ;) ). The problem is, I don't know the bars downtown well enough to pick one from thin air. So, we're looking for someplace that has a large taproom/bar that's ok with a lot of standers/movers. This is just for this Friday, we'll figure out something more formal in the future. Any ideas???? Please? Let me know asap, or I'll be relying on the internet for all my information! Noooooooeeesssss!!!

edit3: Ok, I just emailed the mods for officialness. I got 5 votes for the Providence Tavern in *Edgewater, so that will be the official place. I'm gonna say 5-8pm (sigh working a normal day job), but feel free to show up early or stay late. I'll be wearing something so you all will know me. A Blue Scarf or a Floppy Hat or a Red Rose or something equally as corny. Hehehe, I'll let you know! There were some awesome ideas for other meetups too. Maybe I can put together a calendar or something. I had a dream last night that involved fancy hats and a picnic. We'll see where that leads. :D Anyway, I hope to see you all on Friday!!!

What responsibilities you'd have would be to clean and maintain the store to standards and to serve customers. The job can get tedious but is pretty fun.

So, lets put together of all of the reasons that people should want this to take place in Denver. After we get a good list, we could write up a proposal to post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditcon). 

Interested? I'll start:

* Denver has a great convention center. 
* We're reasonably priced. Hotels are pretty inexpensive, and airfare is not outrageous. 
* Our public transportation makes it really easy to get around the city and to/from the airport.

I worked in the shelters and helped with the aftermath.  These tips come from working with the people that lost everything. 

1. If you live near the fire be prepared to evacuate. Fire moves fast and many of the people I talked to had five minutes between the time they were told to evacuate until when their property was engulfed in flames. 

2. The most important thing to pack and bring with you is your pets. One of the most common ways people die in wildfires is because they went back to save a family pet.   Shelters will allow pets.

3. Be sure to bring prescriptions. It can be very difficult to get replacements. 

4. Don't forget your important papers such as birth certificates, social security card, insurance info and any paperwork you have on your home. These items will be important during recovery and will help speed up the process of rebuilding. 

5.  If you have time take pictures of your home and property before leaving. Most phones can do pictures or video and this will be very helpful in proving value if things are lost. 

6.  Don't worry about food. Shelters will provide food for you. 

7.  If possible grab a week's worth of clothes but that should be a low priority. Tons of clothing will be donated to fire victims. 

8. Expect to be out of your home for at least a week. Even if your property isn't damaged, once you are evacuated you are likely to be displaced until they are sure there are no downed power lines or hotspots left.   They will often also keep the area locked down for extra time to prevent looting. 

9.  If there are multiple evacuation shelters go to the main one. That is where the insurance companies and federal representatives will focus their attention. 

10.  Don't risk your life. One of the fire victims in Texas was killed because he went back into the fire area to get a tool he had left behind.   Fire is unpredictable, even if it looks safe it may not be. Don't risk it. ",,False,,t5_2qn3i,False,,,True,t3_rg1rm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/rg1rm/some_wildfire_advice/,

By some miracle, his friend, the driver, only suffered minor physical injuries and Daniel's dog, Jelly, was uninjured. Unfortunately, Daniel was airlifted from a Boulder, CO hospital to Denver Health in critical condition and remains on life support. 

Daniel is fighting a severe traumatic brain injury to his brain stem area, along with multiple facial and skull fractures. He's making small improvements through surgery and is now breathing on his own, but still needs all of the prayers, thoughts and good vibes that he can get. Being without health insurance, Daniel and his family are facing enormous medical bills. 

We have created a fundraising campaign for Dan to help him and his family during this difficult time. Anything and everything helps, so please share with your friends and family.

I tried to put a laundry hamper over him, but the escaped to a nearby tree and is perched on a branch. He's still not moving (just sitting there).

Anyone want to come attempt to safely catch/remove him from the tree so that Birds of Prey can come render aid? I feel bad, poor guy just isn't acting right.

EDIT, THE FINAL: Bird appears to be ok. We tried to get it out of the tree, he kept jumping to higher branches. We decided to try and get him to leave the tree voluntary to see if he could fly more than a couple feet. We pulled the tree branch down, and then he took off and swooped all the way across the yard into another (much taller) tree.

yesterday my wife lost her wedding ring; she's been losing weight which is great, but that caused her wedding ring to fall off unexpectedly which is less great.

She was on the light rail coming from way south denver to the convention center, then walked up through highlands and finally hung out at some baths downtown. At the baths, she realized she didn't have her ring; unfortunately that's as specific as an area as we have.

I am on Pearl and 8th and notice a lot of the incidents are occurring within about a mile radius of this area. I just got this email and thought you guys might be interested.

&gt; Dear Mr. Blackwood,
 
&gt; I am corresponding on behalf of Chief G. Whitman. Let me begin by thanking you for bringing your concerns to my attention. My staff and I have been diligently working the past six months towards identifying, arresting, and prosecuting the criminal element involved in dangerous and unlawful activities in your neighborhood as well as in the rest of District 6.
 
&gt; This past summer through crime analysis we identified a pattern of aggravated assaults taking place in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. A two month coordinated operation was conducted, targeting suspects that we believed were responsible for the crimes being committed. The special operations run in the Capitol Hill area produced 58 arrests (8 of which were directly connected to the pattern identified) more than 200 contacts of suspicious persons, and the recovery of 8 handguns.
 
&gt; Since September, we have not had a repeat crime that fit the pattern investigated. With that said, we have had a number of disturbing crimes committed in the neighborhood.
 
&gt; I have included my command staff in this correspondence. I have asked them to share your concerns with our supervisory staff as well as the officers assigned to our district.
 
&gt; We will continue to focus our resources in this area for the purpose of identifying and apprehending persons involved in criminal behavior.
 
&gt; We are also in need of the assistance of the community in addressing the challenges that we face. Please ask your neighbors to report suspicious persons, persons involved in even minor offenses, or events witnessed that appear to be unlawful to our non-emergency police number (720-913-2000). Should a serious offense be witnessed, we would ask that the 911 emergency telephone number be called.
 
&gt; Thank you once again.

I live in between the two landmarks and had nothing to do that day so I figured ""why not?""

So I did that and all was good. 

The next day, I was driving to work when I ran out of gas on the way there. I knew I was low but I wanted to get to work and get gas afterwards. I barely made it to work. My steering locked up and my car died just as I was coasting into my parking spot. But it was okay because there was a gas station right across the street. 

So I get off work and walk to the gas station to borrow their gas can. As it turns out, they are no longer allowed to keep an open gas can on the property. I was stunned. And pissed. Because they closed in ten minutes and I was going to have to find some *other* way to get gas into my car. 

This guy about my age heard me talking with the attendant and turned and said ""wait, you need a gas can?""

I nodded dumbly. 

""I live up the block, I'll be right back.""

He got in his truck and drove away and came back with a gas can, which he then proceeded to fill up *for* me. I kept trying to give him cash and he kept saying ""just help out the next guy."" I promised I would.

I'm not really a believer in karma but that whole experience was pretty convincing. Just thought I'd share it with one of my favorite subreddits because this is where it all started.

""Will I be able to smoke marijuana in a bar?""",BlackbeltJones,77,18,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/19fwn8/final_meeting_of_the_a64_task_force_concludes/,"I'll do a bigger write-up tomorrow on the Task Force's final recommendations but the meeting ran way long tonight.

Between the prohibitionists and the protectionists on the committee, and Governor Hickenlooper thanking them, I'm amazed we gained any ground at all... as someone in the peanut gallery remarked, ""Voters set sail for the New World but the ship captains laid plans for a flat Earth ahead.""

So will we be able to legally smoke marijuana in a bar setting? In the words of Reverend Lovejoy, ""Short answer: Yes, with an *if...,* Long answer: No, with a *but...*""

I'll start with the latter; the former is my TL;DR.

**NO, BUT** there are 7 interlocking recommendations at play where authority may be recommended to counties and municipalities versus statewide rulemaking.

I'll list these 7 recommendations, and you can assume Task Force consensus unless I specifically mention there is no consensus. Whenever there is no consensus, there are at least one or two ""leading"" recommendations to be offered in the final proposal (due out the week of March 11).

1. Create regulations with the overarching philosophy that alcohol and marijuana should NOT be consumed in combination

2. Explicitly prohibit marijuana products that are combined with tobacco or alcohol. (Sorry, no THC beer)

3. Amend the body of the Clean Air Act to change instances of ""tobacco"" to ""tobacco and marijuana""

4. Amend the Cigar-Tobacco Bar exemption to explicitly DISALLOW marijuana consumption (Sorry, no Cigar-Tobacco-and-Marijuana Bar)

5. Amend ""the outdoor area of any business"" exemption to explicitly DISALLOW marijuana consumption -- **NO CONSENSUS**. The two leading recommendations are: 1; explicitly disallow it, or 2; leave it for counties/municipalities as a zoning determination. If 2, then cities may require additional permits from businesses to allow MJ-friendly patios.

6. Redefine consumption conducted ""Openly and Publicly""

6a. Openly -- **NO CONSENSUS**. However, the leading definition is: *not protected from unaided observations lawfully made from outside its perimeter not involving physical intrusion.*

6b. Publicly: *area is open to general access* **without restriction**. It was clarified that ID-checking, admission fees, etc., would all be considered restrictions.

7. Create separate, incompatible licensing requirements for retail marijuana sales and retail alcohol sales to prevent dual licenses in a single establishment -- **NO CONSENSUS**

So... before we can smoke marijuana in a bar legally, the General Assembly must not ban them outright, must not rigidly define ""open"" consumption, and must specifically delegate the authority to allow counties to create certain marijuana-related exemptions to the Clean Air Act.

So smoking in a bar legally may still require some hoop-jumping on a local level. Going to one bar to purchase both alcohol and weed to drink and smoke on-premises may be a whole 'nother animal.

And I say *may* because the General Assembly may not like any of the Task Force recommendations, and individual politicians may desire to soapbox and posture and stagnate about marijuana as they've always done.

Anyway, that's enough for tonight, and it's just the beginning. The Task Force is calling it's proposal ""The Long Bill."" The final draft should put the 75 pages of HB1284 MMJ regs to shame.

TL;DR: **YES, IF** the General Assembly adopts the more lenient of all of the above recommendations upon which the A64 Task Force could not reach reasonable consensus, you will be able to legally smoke marijuana in a bar setting.",,False,,t5_2qn3i,1362109263.0,,,True,t3_19fwn8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/19fwn8/final_meeting_of_the_a64_task_force_concludes/,

Here's a little guide..,d-rav,69,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1emg95/have_questions_about_a_particular_development_in/,"As we've all seen, Denver is rapidly growing. There is construction all over the place. Some things are quite hard to follow and digging around is required. Example, [This Reddit post had a question about what's going on at Broadway and Louisiana](http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1eh37a/new_building_at_louisiana_and_south_broadway/). So, just in case you didn't see my comment on that thread, here is what I do to find out about a particular project:

Is it within a 2ish mile radius of Downtown Denver? Check [DenverInfill](http://denverinfill.com/blog). We keep up with the downtown projects. Everything we post, as far as new projects are concerned, is official and confirmed through the developer.

For all other projects around Denver proper and smaller scale projects around downtown, there is a nifty guide Denver Development Services produces every couple months. This contains all the major building permits for Denver. [Link to the most current report](http://www.denvergov.org/Portals/696/documents/SitePlanReview/DenverMajorProjects2.7.13.pdf)

Once you've located your permit record number, i.e 2012D00377, and want to check the status of it, head on over [here](http://www.denvergov.org/developmentservices/DenverDevelopmentServices/HelpMeFind/CheckYourBuildingPlanReviewStatus/tabid/437372/Default.aspx), type / paste the record number in the box and click check status. This will show you if there are any reviews such as zoning, design, etc. The first four numbers of the permit is the year it was filed. If it's 2010 / 2011, there's a good chance it's an inactive project.

Some permits don't have any details when you look them up but are active projects. To dig a little deeper type the project name in Google like this: ""1756 Clarkson"" denvergov. This limits your search mostly to www.denvergov.org and you can usually find out more information about the project you are researching such as site plans, who owns that particular parcel, etc. 

I hope this helps those that are curious about some developments around Denver. I use this report a lot and it's a great resource. Happy researching!",,False,,t5_2qn3i,1368955024.0,,,True,t3_1emg95,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1emg95/have_questions_about_a_particular_development_in/,

Restaurants are possible, but typically you can have a bigger impact from purchasing goods or items rather than food products, as these products don't have to be replenished. Hardware stores, toy shops, antique shops, hobby shops are all great. In addition, the lower the cost of the individual items (thrift store or equivalent prices), the better the odds that you can get a bunch of people. The more expensive, the less likely the average Denver resident will be able to afford to participate.

On Feb. 6th, my girlfriend was hit by a car on her bike, near E. Mississippi Ave &amp; Cherry Creek S. Drive in Glendale.

She doesn't remember it at all - she just woke up in the hospital when I got the call. No idea who hit her, whether it was a hit-and-run or not, etc. She has a court date in March since apparently she's at fault here, which kind of seems like straight bullshit to me.. but that's neither here nor there.

I'm hoping someone out there witnessed this accident and can help us piece together exactly what happened, and if she can fight the apparent ticket she's getting out of this.

P.S, she's fine - just some stitches and lots of bruises that are clearing up just fine.

Thanks for any help.. I know it's a long shot!",,False,,t5_2qn3i,False,,,True,t3_197n9c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/197n9c/hey_rdenver_did_you_witness_a_caronbike_accident/,
