&gt;Police 1: let me see your hands
&gt;
&gt;Me: what?
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: let me see your hands!
&gt;
&gt;Me: here they are. (nothing in them)
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Put your hands on the steering wheel!
&gt;
&gt;Me: OK OK
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: What are you doing tonight?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Just out dumpster diving seeing if I can find anything of interest.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Did you find anything good?
&gt;
&gt;Me: No the only thing of interest was a picture frame outside of the dumpster, but I left that as it wasn't 
&gt;deemed garbage.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: I see. Could you step out of the car?
&gt;
&gt;Me: No problem

At this point two more patrol cars pull up lights flashing.

&gt;Police 1: Put your hand on your hood.
&gt;
&gt;Me: OK (putting my hands on the hood getting ready to be searched)
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: I said head, put your hands on your head!
&gt;
&gt;Me: Oh sorry I thought you said hood.

I will leave out the drug banter and illegal items.

&gt;Police 1: Why are you dumpster diving?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Because as odd as it sounds I enjoy it.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: OK? Are all these items in your backseat yours? (referring to my fishing, climbing, and work gear)
&gt;
&gt;Me: Yes they are mine.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Why do you have three laptops?
&gt;
&gt;Me: I work in IT.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: So you work in IT and you dumpster dive?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Yea, it seems strange, but I actually do enjoy it.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: Ok, strange, have a seat over here.

One cop starts ripping through my car trying to find anything they can.

&gt;Police 2: Whats in the backpack?
&gt;
&gt;Me: There are two fish in the main compartment, probably a multi-tool or fillet knife, and some tackle. (I literally 
&gt;just got done getting searched at the river, because I guess it's strange a fisherman fishes into the dark...)
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: You seriously have fish in a backpack?
&gt;
&gt;Me: Yes, they are on a stringer.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: You've got a pretty interesting life...
&gt;
&gt;Me: That's how I like it.
&gt;
&gt;The other cop is done searching and starts walking over.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Whats with all the cereal in the front seat?
&gt;
&gt;Me: I made a big score at Aldi just a minute ago, and stocked up.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: So you didn't buy these?
&gt;
&gt;Me: (gulping and thinking oh fuck) Correct.  They were in the dumpster being prepared to be sent to the dump.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: But you didn't take anything outside of the dumpster?
&gt;
&gt;Me: No sir, I refuse to.  If it's not garbage it's someones property.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Correct, I will ask you again.  Did you take anything outside of the dumpster.
&gt;
&gt;Me: No, Donations are for the less needy, and I refuse to steal.

At this point it's going great.  I've got 3 patrol cars, and about 6 bags of cereal from aldi's dumpster.

I watch police 1 + 2 talking in front of their squad car, and they keep looking at me.  Finally police 2 shrugs and starts to laugh.  Slowly they both walk over and start talking to me.

&gt;Police 1: We can't seem to find a threat here, and I just request you don't take anything that isn't in the dumpster.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: We get a call every night about this dumpster.  An overly concerned neighbor seems to be spying the dumpster.
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: You are free to go.  Just be safe and stay out of trouble.
&gt;
&gt;Me: You literally get a call every night?
&gt;
&gt;Police 1: Yep never fails... (they both agree with an upset look)
&gt;
&gt;Me: wow, I probably wont be back then.  Sorry for bothering you.  I'm sure there is more important items than this.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: We would definitely appreciate it, but if you do just stick to the dumpster.  
&gt;
&gt;Me: Deal, Have a great night and stay safe.
&gt;
&gt;Police 2: Don't forget that laptop on the roof of your car!

&gt;Me: Aww shit, Thanks!

All in all it was a successful and eventful night. I was searched twice in a matter of an hour, got a lot of cereal, and some TP.  Was basically told dumpsters are fair game, but stick directly to them.",,False,self,t5_2qy4c,1346693753.0,,,True,t3_zaebg,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/zaebg/running_into_fuzz/,

Me and my friends had been diving for about 6 months, and we were always getting good scores. We used to take everything we could. Then I noticed when we were leaving one night after a mediocre score that someone else was going to that dumpster. 

I felt really bad about having already taken all of the food worth taking. After this, I started always leaving some good food behind. Usually at the top of the trash, but still in the dumpster. I would put it in a box so it would be all clean and ready for anyone else who wanted to hit that spot.

After a couple of months of doing this, and telling all my friends about ""not burning the source"" (Taking more than you can actually eat, taking everything in the dumpster, etc.) I started to notice that sometimes I would come to a spot, and all the food would already be sitting at the top waiting for me. 

It feels really good to leave a little, and especially good when you see someone has been there already that night and left you what they couldnt take.

I would recommend everyone subscribed to this sub to try it some time. Explain the idea to your other diving friends, and see what happens in your area.



**tl;dr**


Dont take *all* the food from your dumpster if you know other people go there. Leave a bit of good stuff behind, and tell others to do the same.

So I found a few computer repair shops and independent stores that would throw out old computer parts, over the course of a few weeks I collected a mother board, hard drive, cd-rom drive, keyboard, mouse, memory, power supply, case, and fans. the only part I had to buy was the processor.

* Half a big bottle of tequila

* unopened white wine

* Tons of nice clothing for her kids (Polo, Ralph Lauren, etc...)

* Beautiful XL black leather coat (expensive)

* 3 lbs chocolate covered espresso beans, never opened

* Packages of Keebler cookies, never opened

* Coffee grinder

* Dish towels

* Bath towels 

* Blank legal pads of paper, pens, pencils, tape, office supplies

* A Bose speaker

* pop up hampers

* sheets (new in packages)

* Down comforter

* Tons of shampoo, conditioner, shaving cream

* unopened vitamins

* dishes

* jewelry

* Olympus camera

* ...and more.

We didn't find as many electronics as we have in the past -- in the last few years we found working kindles and other pads, stereos, etc.... I think times are a little leaner.

At one dumpster a guy came out and said ""What do you think you're doing?"". I replied without thinking, ""Digging through your trash"". He said ""Oh. OK. Just leave the area clean"". Hahahahahaha!!!!!!! I have no shame, evidently  :)

It came apparent that the people at Dunkin Donuts people called the cops on us. While we thought we had done nothing wrong, the cop informed us otherwise. Said that we could even be charged with breaking and entering (Since the dumpster was techincally cloesd) My two friends decided to run (they where drunk and underage) I decided to stay.

You know [of] the [song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ClCpfeIELw). 

But, I have another story... and I am building a memory I hope I will never forget.

I've been diving in dumpsters for a few years as a sideline activity, because I didn't really *need* dumpster stuff. Rather, I just felt it was wasteful that some useful stuff was being discarded. So, I'd look for things I could donate to my friend's thrift store. She'd get them free, and could sell them for a dollar or two. And I felt like I was making a small contribution to the effort to save our planet. Win-win, all the way.

I remember one late night a couple years ago, I happened into the local convenience store just as the Krispy Kreme donut guy was making his nightly refresh to their donut case. He was about to throw away several dozen donuts and fruit pies and offered to let me have as much of them as I wanted. At that time, I learned (made a mental note) that Krispy Kreme puts fresh donuts out daily, and refreshes their pies periodically as well. In the process, they throw away a LOT of stuff, BUT... they also have a policy of not donating these to *anywhere*... so it all goes into the dumpster. Nightly. As I said, I made a mental note and moved on. I didn't need all that sugar and fat.

A couple months ago, my life took a turn for the worse...

I lost my less-than-part-time job that was keeping sufficient supplemental food on my plate (supplemental to the food banks and soup kitchens). When this happened, I found myself hungry quite often. Very hungry, in fact. 

I remembered the Krispy Kreme encounter and decided that I was now hungry enough to check dumpsters for food - which I had never done before. 

I started with the convenience store.

While I missed the Krispy Kreme guy, I did remember which of their trash cans he used for discarding old product, and ... sure enough... there were those sweet, fattening, glorious morsels of breakfast goodness.

Shortening what has now become a long story and could get even longer if I included all of the details, I befriended one of the night clerks. She was a new employee at the time, and... at first... I think I creeped her out a little when I'd come over to dig through their garbage for food.

As time passed, however, she's gotten used to me being there every morning to collect donuts and other items from their garbage (heat-and-eat sandwiches that they must throw away after X hours in the hot-n-ready oven, hotdogs and bratwurst sausages and other items from their hot grill, etc.). And, she has also adjusted the way she goes about doing her nightly chores. I rarely have coffee grounds mixed with dry food in the same bag - she separates those quite frequently now. And, the last few mornings, she's made sure there have been a few extra bratwurst sausages (like 4 or 5) every morning.

She's only about 20 years old, and I'm a dirty old man. But, this morning, I had to find out her name. Not for any creepy reason. But, rather, because I wanted to leave a note for her manager this coming holiday season, expressing my sincere thankfulness for this young lady. As hopeful as I am that this most humble (and humiliating) time of life will be brief, this young lady has made it much more tolerable.

As I was saying...  I had enough money to buy myself a real cigar (I normally smoke ""refry"" - butts re-rolled into roll-your-own) and a soda refill. I became a real customer this morning, just so I could find out this young lady's name - this young lady who has been feeding me breakfast for about 2 months.

If you haven't guessed, by the title of this post, her name is Tiffany.

I hope I never forget my breakfast at Tiffany's

Thank you, Tiffany. And God Bless You!!!

EDIT: I want to thank everyone who commented for their wise and insightful responses. I am in no rush ... especially not a rush to make any mistakes or to harm this young lady's life in any way. I will think these things over very thoroughly before I make any gestures of gratitude other than a polite thank you (as I have done the few times when she was taking out trash while I was digging in the dumpster). I absolutely do NOT want to make any waves here, whatsoever. I'm grateful for your comments. All of you.

It's warming up so I started surfing again. I was out and about tonight, disappointed my surf didn't turn up a whole lot - a furry jacket, some containers (I like to put odds and into containers), a back massager..pretty slim for a 3h run. 

Anyways, I was going to call it quits tonight...when on a whim, I made a left, instead of a right turn to head home. I wanted to see, shits and giggles, if a store I visited once before still had a chain and lock on their skip enclosure (10 foot high walls and doors). 
I didn't like checking this place out last time because it was well lit, and fairly close to the street (facing it). This time, instead of parking in front of the store, I drove down a block and around to pull in to the dark neighborhood behind. I grabbed a few big heavy duty bags with me (just in case) and walked over. The back of the store wasn't very lit, but I had my flashlight to light the bike path to the store side.

Cars drove by once every minute or so. I didn't want to be seen because I've been surprised by police vehicles checking me out because someone reported suspicious behavior (reason I parked a block away). 
I looked over to the gate - just my luck, no lock and chain, plus the door was ajar. 
I scooted in and closed the door behind me. I made note of the doors being just wood slats, and that if I had my light on while a car drove by it would be seen. Their bin was fairly large for this type of store. It was also full. I opened the side door and got a huge grin. 
I spent the next 45 minutes ""shopping"". 

I ended up with 6 large bags of  (mainly dairy) groceries:

* Piles of yogurt (28lbs *[13kg]* of assorted sizes and flavors of yogurt from 3.5oz *[100g]* to 23oz *[650g]* containers)
* Milk of all kinds/percentages/flavours (bags and cartons totaling 8 gallons *[30L]*)
* About 100 eggs (a few were cracked and some missing from cartons) 
* Several boxes of cookies and crackers 
* And a couple boxes of ""fancy"" chocolates

The funniest part, about half of the loot isn't even expired yet, and won't until next month. There was more stuff in the bins, but I didn't have any more bags and I didn't want multiple trips back and forth. 

**tl;dr**

Started out a crappy night, but ended up hauling more stuff than I could carry - all on a whim. I love whims. My work lunches for the next while will be packed with snacks galore!

*--edit--*

Formatting.

*--edit 2--*

I did a double take on the eggs. All 100 (minus broken ones) are good. I mistook the abbreviation for May as March. I've given half of them away..No way I can eat all that by myself - and the point of this was to try to avoid wasting perfectly good food. I'm covered for dairy for the next little while. ..now just to find other food groups. No such thing as Trader Joe's or equivalent in my area, but I'll keep a vigilant eye out.

I took a shortcut on my way home, and noticed an open dumpster by a local supermarket. I've been visiting r/frugal, and I'm the sort to carry a flashlight around with me. I figured the dumpstergods wanted to tell me something.

I took a look and sitting there, right inside the door, was a huge box with an enormous amount of different stuff. There was lots to get, so I hurried back and got my girlfriend to come along. This is what we got (Only counting stuff in good condition):

 - 13 different assortments of bread, everything from rye bread to baguettes, and stuff I've never even tasted before.
 - Olives
 - Capers
 - A big hunk of meat (It's freezing outside, so it was definitely cold enough to take along).
 - 5 bottles of assorted dip for salad
 - 12 flower bouquets, all colors, simply beautiful!
 - Potatoes. Got 10 kg of potatos!
 - Shrimp salad and lots of salmon pate (Not sure about these, since fish can be touchy, but we figured they'd be OK)
 - Brown sugar
 - Tomatoes, both cherry and regular!
 - Citrus fruits... Limes everywhere!
 - Bananas!
 - A variety of different herbs, all of them smashed but still alive. My girlfriend says she can bring them back to life!
 - 5 bags with mixed different salads.

This list is just off the top of my head, I'm sure we got more. In my country, all of that food is at least worth 100$! And it's in so good condition too. The saladdressings were in perfect condition, and can last until summer, and a lot of the stuff was like that. If they keep the dumpster unlocked, and if there's the same amount every week, we could literally cut our food budget down to 0$.

I'm amazed that this is possible, but I'm even more amazed what kind of stuff supermarkets throw out. It's literally obscene for all of this good food to end up somewhere to rot, when there are so many people in this world who have to work 12 hours a day for something not even half as good.

Anyway, keep diving guys! I sure as hell will!

EDIT: Oh, and I forgot to mention: It was exciting too. I never expected it would be so much fun. It was almost like christmas!

**EDIT2**: As promised, here's a pic of about 2/3's of [the score](http://i.imgur.com/zT6oK.jpg). At this point, we had already stocked away all the bread, meat, and some of the flowers. The meat is really high quality and had a punctured package, but I figure it's OK, because the last sale date is in the future, and there's frost outside.

**EDIT3:** So here's a picture of my first [dumpster meal](http://imgur.com/a/EuRkZ). Can't believe that it's possible to get this good food for 0$. And it's not something I'd make normally myself either. Tomorrow It'll be meatballs with potatoes, brown sauce and red cabbage (Gotta use the awesome red cabbage and some of the potatoes I picked up yesterday).",,False,self,t5_2qy4c,1358545984.0,,,True,t3_16si9g,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/16si9g/my_first_dive_i_cant_believe_i_didnt_start_this/,

One of our local stores apparently doesn't have a backup generator, or it didn't last as long. Halfway through the next day, they were throwing away all their frozen goods that had any danger at all of thawing. Tubs and tubs of breyer's ice cream (~100), many boxes of frozen treats like those expensive Magnum ice cream bars (5$ apiece at the local convenience store, acquired 20 boxes of them), caramilk ice cream bars, drumsticks, creamsicles, fudgsicles, etc. were all thrown out.

Realizing this, I called every one of my friends to come meet me (with spoons!) behind the store, when one of them came in his dad's pickup truck. We loaded it full of trash bags filled with ice cream and stuffed our fridges full of delicious free Ben and Jerry's ice cream. Perfect for this disgusting heat wave that has hit us recently...

So that was my weekend. How was yours?&lt;/ brag&gt;

Lesson of the story: Find out who has backup generators and how long they'll last. Or just cruise after long blackouts.

I've been MIA, but I'm glad to be back enjoying the hauls everyone's sharing.

I just wanted to add my latest find (as in, less than 1 hr ago) from compactor shopping @ my complex. It's way too early (for me) so no pics yet. Sorry.

I'm now the proud owner of a white GE microwave-model JES1334WD man'd Dec. 2008.  I plugged it in &amp; tested it with a 4 oz cup of water just to see if it would heat anything (I certainly wasn't putting any food in there before clean up). The only thing wrong with it is that the turntable is missing; I think I can easily find one at a thrift store. I rarely use microwaves anyway (mostly just to quickly heat water for tea/defrost things), so I'm in no rush.

As it happens, I almost missed out on it, because I haven't been diving much recently, and I'd decided not to go out last night either.  Something told me just to check around 5:30 this morning (pickup is around 7am), so I drug myself out w/my bag o' trash at 6. 

When I got there, I saw a Hamilton Beach box laying on its side, and went to throw it into the dumpster [I'm the ""leave things cleaner than you found them"" type]. I tried to grab it &amp; realized there was something inside. Leaned over &amp; saw the top of the unit. Of course I thought ""there's no way this thing works."" I lugged it home anyway,&amp; lo &amp; behold, it does! 

There's a dryer @ the other on-site dumpster that probably works too, but there was absolutely no way I could get it home to test. Sucks, since I rent my washer/dryer each month. :-(

My diving experience over the last month has definitely changed my outlook on what we deem trash in our society. I'm excited to see what else I come across in my casual diving efforts.

**Found any good appliances in your diving/curb surfing efforts lately?**

As always, thanks for reading!

XOXO,

(Little story and to share what we found),splatterghost,29,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/1kjw8u/third_time_out_diving_cops_came_along_little/,"So my friends and I have been getting into dumpster diving mainly sticking to Gamestop and a US cellular store. This took place at the US cellular store. We had been there for about five minutes when a red GMC truck comes around the corner and slows down when he sees us. The truck drives real slow passing my car and kind of just watching us when he got close to us I waved but the driver didn't wave back as he crept by. He drove maybe 25 feet past us and kind of sat there shortly but we didn't really think much of it and went back to diving.

The dumpster proved to be really good we found an old blackberry, an otterbox belt clip that fit my friends case, and an Iphone 3gs that was cracked. Well we shut the dumpster and went to go get in the car to head on out when I notice a cop car pulling up and parks parallel to us. I waved at the officer and kind of just sat there unsure of what to do as we waited for him to get out of the car. 

(This may not be 100% accurate but its about how the conversation went)

PO: ""What are you boys up to tonight?""

ME: (In a friendly tone) ""Just dumpster diving, we found a smashed Iphone""

PO: Can I see the Iphone? We have a report of a stolen 4 today?

Me: Sure (I grabbed it out of the back seat handed it to him he looks it over and hands it back since it was only a 3gs.)

PO: ""I know it's easy to do at night but the owner just called in saying he saw some people outback with flash lights acting suspicious."" (The owner was the one in the red GMC truck.)

Me: ""Ah sorry we didn't mean to cause any trouble. We wont come back here again""

PO: "" Oh I know its just the owner called in again (We had been there before but never met a cop) do you boys have ID's on you?""

We gave him our ID's and he called them in. At this point the officer had gone to more of a relaxed mood he knew we weren't gonna cause him any trouble and we weren't doing anything wrong.

PO: Is this your car?

Me:""Yeah I bought it off my grandma a few years ago and upgraded the rims and what not""

PO: ""Yeah its a nice car""

Me: ""Thanks I'm trying to make sure it last me through college""

PO: ""It sure looks like it will""

Call comes back ID's are clean

Po:""Alright you boys are ok to go""

Me:""Thanks""

The officer drove off to the side of the lot and we drove out he didn't follow us. I figured I'd share this story just to show there are some really nice cops out there.

Some tips:

1. Order the book 'Evasion' online (published by Crimethinc). It is super cheap and i consider it the bible of dumpster diving. A million ideas, tips and experiences. Beyond diving it is madly inspiring and describes a very interesting lifestyle that you may or may not want to follow but that is still fascinating to read about. It will help you to think outside the box/dumpster and see a plethora of new places and opportunities to score free goodies (whether you want to follow the law abiding path or not).

2. Gear. Bring the right tools for the job. Having a bike with panniers, a big backpack, tons of plastic bags and a 1.2 meter stick with hook on the end can be helpful. Bike will mean you can cover way more ground and dumpsters. The beauty if diving is you never know what you will find. Having plenty of capacity to haul back even large items is great. Plastic bags is for food, unless you like a rotting decomposing smell in you backpack of course. Stick can be handy for really grotty dumpsters you'd rather not dive in. Often the best stuff is below a layer of gunk. With the stick you can stay clean and still quickly asses any dumpster.
I like to bring some basic tools: claw hammer, bit screw driver, knife etc. This allows me to also take really nice hardware or more technical items to fix up my house or to make electronic gear.

3. I wear a gray, business suit jacket (second hand) and look clean cut, smell good and just am chill about the whole thing. Like it is the most normal thing in the world and i belong there. Which of course is the case. I enjoy putting the prejudices on their head and if you do get into a confrontation with some sort of authority figure, looking decent will often mean the difference between getting a warning and getting a fine or even being hauled off to a police station/getting into a scuffle. Dumpster owners will be much nicer to you too.

4. Never be afraid to share the loot with fellow divers nor to ask friendly looking people for tips. Just smile, make small talk and often times passerby's or the person who threw out the garbage will offer more goodies or locations!

5. 'Enjoy &amp; Control yourself, take only what you need' and leave the dumpster in at least as good a condition as you found it. If they start compacting or locking all dumpsters we all lose out.

6. Bring a buddy! Safer and way more fun. Plus you always find more than you need, especially food.",,False,self,t5_2qy4c,1348521647.0,,,True,t3_10ev2m,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/10ev2m/20_year_of_diving_some_ideas_tips_and_tricks/,

I just wanted to put it out there that the act of purposely tainting salvageable food is pretty high up on the scale of scum-baggery. Do you think that the people who are responsible for this think ""I'm not gaining anything from this food, so nobody else is allowed to either""?

I’m not new to diving although it’s been a long time since I’ve ventured into the dumpster arena. 

As a teenager I used to go diving with my dad. The best was when we went to the local donut store and we would haul out huge garbage bags full of donuts. When we got home we would stick them in our freezer and when we wanted to eat them we threw them in the oven. Yummy.
Also got every Disney movie possible on vhs back in the day. Tv’s, books, vcr’s, etc etc…

So after reading through quite a few posts in here I decided to try and hit up an Aldi dumpster. I didn’t plan this trip, though I happened to be driving past an Aldi that I had never shopped at before. So on a whim decided to go with the flow and see what they had in store for me.

The dumpster wasn’t exactly hidden and quite near another very busy business. I wasn’t liking that at all. Makes me feel like someone would confront me and I feel more vulnerable being a woman. 
So anyways I slide the dumpster open and peek in, I see some tomato’s, grab them, eww, threw them back. Pick up a box, shit, it’s really heavy. Inside are a bags of oranges and apples. 
I grab both and bolt for my car. Haha

I don’t know why I was so scared, but I just needed to get out of there. I also had my infant with me, my car wasn’t hidden and I just felt exposed. 

I get home and all of the oranges seem to be just fine. I was only able to save 3 apples out of the huge bunch though.
Overall I’m quite thrilled with my first find. It’s expensive feeding my family and if I can stop by a dumpster once or twice a week and do a quick dive it will save me some bucks. 

Happy diving everyone!

Up until now I've never really considered diving for food. I've always been the furniture/small household items kind of diver. However, after seeing a few posts here about local hauls, tonight I went to a store that's been frequently mentioned. Sure enough there was a goldmine of food. 

However, the husband cast doubts on the safety and sanitary aspect of the food. He has a deeper psychological issue with eating out of the dumpster than I do. There were perfectly good items in there, from what I could see. The main question that was brought up is this- how well does the plastic and cardboard protect the food from bacteria that has already existed in the dumpster? how ""safe"" is a case of bottled water versus a cellophane wrapped vegetable, or a cardboard box of crackers or cereal? 

Other questions are: What are things that you personally refuse to touch? What precautions do you take when washing/ eating produce? How do you get over the psychological ""trash"" factor?

It was a good haul this year. 

* Enough laundry detergent to probably last me the year. $40
* 4-5 packs of Clorox/Lysol cleaning wipes - $15
* 12-pack of AMP energy drinks. $15
* 12-pack of Oceanspray 16oz. Juice - $8
* 2 Armani Medium Dress Shirts, mint condition. perfect size. wearing one right now.$150 
* 1 polo shirt, 2 pair jeans, 1 cool shirt - $20
* Loose change - $10
* Misc. Womens clothes, shoes, and purses - Took to consignment shops for $80
* A few rugs I'm going to clean for my new apt. - $20
* A nice army style duffle bag- $?
* 12-pack worth of ok beer - $10
* 2 cell phone chargers, which I tend to lose all the time - $10
* 1TB Hard Drive - $50
* Lots of clothes that the consignment store didn't take back - went to goodwill. - Priceless 
* Enough dumpster booze to get too drunk while dumpster diving, therefore forgetting to take the stack of textbooks with you. - Priceless
* **So about $428 total value, including $90 cold hard cash**

I passed up multiple printers and mini-fridges because I just didn't need them. I've overdone it in previous years so this time I really only took what I thought I would really use. I did the diving over probably 4-5 nights over the last month. 2 nights in mid-May when everyone moved out of the residence halls and the last two nights as everyone moved out of the apartments. Some nights I go alone, some nights I go with a couple friends. 

I could have hit the residence halls a bit harder but I was lazy. Overall a good season. Can't wait until next year.

I usually go around 10pm. Ran into a fellow diver at an Aldis dumpster that didn't have much to offer, 2 minutes later a spot light hits us. The cop takes his sweet fucking time pulling into the loading dock and getting out of the squad car. He walks up, lights up a cigarette and asks what were doing, as though its not obvious. Takes down our names and asks again 'So you guys are just looking for recyclables?'. We mutter in agreeance and he leaves. Doesn't tell us to leave and watches as we go back to pulling stuff out.

Turns out that parking lot is a hangout for cops late at night, I pulled out and there were 4 cruisers parked, chatting with each other. This experience was all intensified by my dumbass driving on a suspended license.

The other diver gave me a tip on a dollar tree I never go to that had somewhere around 100+ eggs in it. Never a dull moment.

Anyone have tips on dealing with cops in the future?

I just ran out my door to go hunting (just for the hell of it). I'd read online somewhere that this time of the month (the 7th or 8th) is sometimes good because of dispossession &amp; clean-up after move outs.

There are 2 dumpsters in my complex. I made my way over to the first one &amp; saw a mattress (um, NO) head/footboard...and a round table.

The little table was scuffed,stained &amp; discolored on top. You know the ones- cheap, mass produced for one of those low-end furniture stores...

I really liked the base of it though: round, black cylinder. I'd been wanting to make a sculpture style art column for a vase I have in storage, and I thought ""this will be perfect""!

I tried lifting the table by hand (since it was a cheap one). 

Though the top was light, I wouldn't be able to pick it up @ the base without gloves &amp; get it back to my place.

I figured I'd circle back, check the other dumpster, and grab my gloves...5 minutes tops.

I scoped the other spot &amp; found a great (heavy wood framed) mirror that must've been attached to a dresser @ some point because it had 2 long wooden poles attached. I grabbed it (going to paint the trim for my bedroom) &amp; walked it back home.

Popped inside, grabbed my gloves &amp; IMMEDIATELY headed back out to get ""my"" table. This all took less than 5 minutes, guys.

Since I live 1 minute away from the 1st dumpster, I strode back, fully expecting to pick up the table, no sweat. When I got back downstairs &amp; looked toward the dumpster landing, my mouth dropped open.

**NO WAY**, I thought. No way is that table gone!

But, it was. :-(

Someone must have seen me about to grab it &amp; come down from nearby to snatch it up.

And thus, in less than 5 minutes, my 2 finds of the day turned into 1.

**Ever had that happen?**

Lesson: ALWAYS carry your gloves...and never blink.

Thanks for reading!

I'm hooked for sure! I learned a lot on my first time out. Which places have nothing, which places have locks, which places don't, etc. Overall, I'm very pleased with the results even though it must have been garbage night for majority of the places. I was able to go with a friend so it made it much easier since we could hit multiple places a lot quicker.

What I learned along with the stores I went to.

*Walmart locks everything, even the grocery store Walmart

*Smith's grocery store has the compactors so :(

*Family Dollar, Dollar Store, etc is the one of the BEST places I think. 

*Radio Shack- Nothing, just emptied

*Harbor Freight- Nothing, just emptied

*Game stop- Nothing but garbage

*Sally's- Garbage and a giant box of new light bulbs

*Pay-less Shoe Store- Several brand new gel inserts, new socks and such. This surprised me.

*Barns and Nobel- Cardboard orgy 

*O'rielly Auto Parts- Nothing but garbage

*Target- Had a compactor

*Lowe's- Had a compactor

*Home Depot- Had a compactor

*Car Wash- Locked, we were by one and checked for giggles.

*Maverick- Nothing but gas station burritos that would surly destroy a bathroom later. NOT GOING TO RISK THAT.

There's a lot more places we hit up but I can't remember all of them, we were gone from 10:30 to about 1:00. We didn't drive very far either, we stayed in the city for and hit all the mall strips. We weren't able to get any produce sadly, or bagels from Einsteins due to the store being to far away. We didn't run into anyone, cops, security for that matter.  We split everything 50/50. Anyway's I can't wait to go again!  Thanks reddit!

Heh.

So anyway, this is a problem I'm sure we've all struggled with.  I was reading a thread here in which someone lamented a favorite dumpster getting locked down, and decided to repost a short guide that I wrote out a while back on how to get into these treasure chests of capitalist waste.  At first I didn't want to make this info public, in order to keep these methods effective through the dumpster owners' ignorance of them.  But I feel okay about posting it here - let's just be mindful of where we all put this info out to.

There's a couple ways to get into a locked dumpster. The easiest, which is becoming less commonly possible, is to slide out the back hinge of the top ""flap"" doors and simply pull the flaps off. This is only possible if the hinge is not permanently secured, ideally being a solid rod with a cotter pin through the end. The pin is unbent and pulled out, then the hinge rod is slid out from the opposite side until the back of the flap door is free.

Sometimes, the hinge rod is held in place with a self-locking washer which can usually be beaten off the end of the hinge with a hammer-like object. The rod can then be slid out as above. I've also seen dumpster hinges retained with a common hex nut, which can be easily dealt with using the appropriate wrench.

Many hinges, however, have their ends retained with a conventional washer or other blockage that is permanently welded to the shaft, on both sides. Note that many have this only on one end, with the other end using a retainer like those above, so be sure to check both ends. In cases with a truly permanent retainer, the hinge cannot be practically removed, and so another technique must be used to liberate the trash.

If the hinge is not feasible to remove, the door-flaps themselves can often be compromised. In the case of door-flaps retained by a locking bar on their front end, as in [this image](http://www.phila.gov/streets/images/streetsimages/jimmy_dumpster.gif), most simply is to use a sturdy lever, such as a ""2x4"" piece of wood at least 2-3 feet long, to pry up the middle of the flap, halfway between the hinge and the lock bar. Many plastic door-flaps are even molded to bend and crease on this point, which aids the process. Once this point is pried about 10 inches or more upward, it's usually possible to pull the front of the flap over the bar on the outer corner, and then get the rest of the flap over from there. Note that getting the flap back under the bar is almost impossible, so it will be obvious that someone has opened the dumpster without the key.

Finally, it's important to remember that many dumpsters with a lock do not have a lock on all of their openings. I've seen a great number of ""tall"" dumpsters that have locks on the side ""window"" openings, but leave the top flaps free, and even opened. Similarly, I've seen some that have a lock on just one of two ""window"" openings, with the other completely movable.

It's also possible to open locked dumpsters destructively, though I don't recommend it unless there is pressing cause. The ideal method is to use a razor knife (""box cutter,"" ""utility knife"") to slice the edge or bottom of the ""hinge"" segment of the plastic flap, where it goes around the hinge shaft, for its full length. The door can then be pulled or pried off of the shaft and removed. With some time and tools, it can even be pushed back onto the shaft, and it is unlikely that the damage will ever be noticed, while the dumpster can still function normally.

Further types of destructive entry are possible and obvious, such as using bolt cutters to cut the shackles of padlocks, cutting away sections of the doors, using a grinder or pipe-cutter to sever the hinge shaft, etc., but I don't recommend doing this at all, as it alerts the owner of the dumpster that someone has forced entry, and makes them very angry - possibly angry enough to start using a more secure receptacle, or take measures to catch someone in the act of entering the dumpster at a later date and prosecute them.

I have also noticed a laughable security measure recently, which is to screw an eye-bolt through the plastic ""side window"" sliding doors on some dumpsters and run a padlocked chain or cable from its eye to the steel body of the dumpster.  It's trivial to use a box cutter to make two small slits (horizontal and vertical) around where the bolt enters the plastic door, allowing the nut on the inside to be pulled through.  It may also be possible to pull the eye bolt firmly outward, which impresses the inner nut into the plastic door, and then turn the eyebolt counter-clockwise to slowly unscrew it from the nut inside held this way.  Because of the cable or chain running through the eye, it is unlikely that you will be able to unscrew the nut in one round.  It may require releasing the pull, pushing the bolt in (to free the nut), then re-turning the bolt clockwise to unwind the cable or chain that has come around it.  After enough reptitions, the nut should drop into the dumpster, and the bolt will be able to pull out of the door completely, allowing the door to slide.  Note that if the nut is ""locked"" in any way, or if it has a washer between it and the plastic of the door, this will not work - but I've seen ones that are just a nut and nothing else.

To the point of my story. I recently went to a fast food place with some friends. I grabbed an abandoned shake off of one of the tables outside as we were walking in (the place was empty, so I knew no one wanted it anymore) and drank that. Everyone else bought food. One girl in our group noticed that I hadn't ordered but still was eating something, and asked where I got it. I told her. 

""Look, if you want food, we'll gladly buy you something. It's not a problem,"" she said.

""No, I have money, but if I buy food, then I won't be hungry anymore.""

""Yeah, so you won't have to eat stuff like this. Isn't that a good thing?""

I spend the next few minutes trying to explain to her that, I don't like buying food when I know that perfectly edible stuff sits abandoned just a few feet from me. It's reducing waste. She couldn't wrap her mind around it.

We bought a grab pole - $25 - and we turned down the cheaper option, a $10 Gopher grab pole, because it is flimsy and the grab part was made of two inverted suction cup-shaped peices of plastic.

We went to an Aldi's afterwards, and in between shoving them into two trash bags and into the back of our car, we found:

A case of (mostly) great eggs; we took home seven eggs from this all told

A loaf of 12 grain bread

Two bags of bread buns, one was Kaiser

A Nacho Aldi Brand lunchable, whose  outer box had been trashed

A box of Aldi Brand Fruity Pebbles (again, OUTER box trashed)

Two giant heads of broccoli

Two peices of thin cut sirloin steak

A package of bacon

A box of individually wrapped frozen eggrolls (Yup, ruined box here too)

A bag of frozen vegetables

Three packages of still cold chicken breasts, which came out to nine massive sized breasts.

All told, we more than paid for the grabber, and we got most of our before school starts grocery shopping done with.   This came as a shock to me, as I never would have believed that this sort of a  lifestyle could ever pay for itself in the gas and time that I spend in order to do it or that I could eat far better than I ever could on a minimum wage alone.

* Oil Filter, brand new and in the box.
* Oscillating fan, appeared new and tested to make sure it worked.
* Steering wheel cover, brand new except the packaging had torn. They threw the whole thing out because the plastic packaging torn... lol.

I wanted to share tonight's haul with you. Sorry there's no picture, but I was just TOO tired after the trip I made today.

I started out @ B--, Ba--, &amp; Be---- to see if I could score one of those K--rig machines everyone keeps finding. No luck; mine has a compactor! Arrgh!

Checked out Ul-a since they're in the same plaza (the ladies who wear makeup know what I'm talking about). Nothing doing...

This trip was NOT starting out well.

Walked a few blocks to TJ's- empty (strike 3 for me w/them!). I almost gave up &amp; called it quits. Instead, I headed over to my health food store to see if they had anything for me.

Well...

Only 2 bags in there, but-

--&gt; HERE's What I Got:

* 1 2lb. bag of organic multigrain cereal
* 2 bags of vegan dark chocolate wafer minis (dated 7-2013)
* 2 bags of organic brown rice ""bread crumbs"" (dated 4-30-13)
* 1 bag of organic brown rice macaroni noodles
* 1 2lb. of  Lundberg Organic Sushi Rice
* 3 pks. of RyVita Crisps (had to be like 20 boxes in there)

I discovered when I got home that the wafers had what looked like shipment damage. 2 tiny rips in the bags, but I'm paranoid about anything unwrapped, so... :-(

They were inside a sealed black trash bag by themselves, but I just can't. Oh well.


On to Whole Foods I went. Compactor! (This is the 2nd location I've tried in my city.)

Something told me to walk to a nearby Dollar Tree. Got there, &amp; the bin was empty.  I walked further down the back of the plaza &amp; decided to check out the bin where I estimated the Office supply store was located. in their bin were lots of huge shelves, displays &amp; pieces of what looked like a desk (no car...bummer). I reached underneath a metal shelf and felt a cord wrapped in a rubber band. Turns out I'd found...


**An 8 sheet capacity shredder!**  It had ribbons of paper in it, so I thought it just might still work.  But, I didn't see the trash can to go with it.

Until I climbed up on the side!  It was a bit bent on one side, but still usable. I figured if the shredder was toast, I could still use the garbage bin for my office area. I got it home and...it works perfectly! 

It's amazing because I was just saying to myself the other day that I needed to get a shredder.



I wonder more &amp; more everyday why people throw some stuff away...

Thanks for reading guys! Feel free to comment &amp; ask me anything you want to know.

XOXO,

**Jain Deaux**

Thanks everyone who will never read this for being so wasteful. I would not have this much pleasure surfing, finding my own Early Xmas gifts, had it not be for y'all. 


Last week I put out some household electronics, not one hour later they had all been picked up. I'm glad it ended up with someone rather than the fill. 


I often take requests from the handful of people I that know what I do, for stuff they're looking for. Do you guys surf / dive for yourself, others, money?

*edit*: some stuff I forgot to list

* 3 cordless phones
* a blackberry curve (8300 series)
* a GameCube and Xbox 360 game
* a PS2 guitar hero or rock band (I don't know the difference in accessories) wireless guitar - perfect because I have the game now too (picked up different spots on different days)
* collapseable beach chair with carrying bag
* anti mosquito tent (not a sleeping tent)
* sleeping bag (good because I've misplaced my old one)

*edit2* 

I was going through the electronics I picked up.

PC works, has previous user's data, yet all media has been removed, some games are still installed and work (like WOW - Frozen Throne).

PS2 - turns out it's a Slim (goes to show how much I know about this console) also works. 

DVD player - works. 

Headphones - works, no crackling or distortion. 

I was going through some of the burnt DVDs from the first night's find and saw a disc with the label VCD (movie) but I didn't recognize the name. I popped it in the DVD player to see if it also plays VCDs. Turns out it's an 80s porn. There's definitely more talking than fucking going on. 

This has sure turned out to be a productive week. Hahah. Happy treasure hunting, everyone!

I was behind some buildings in a downtown parking lot, so I naturally went to toss this bag in the nearest dumpster.  It was broad daylight, so I couldn't dive outright.  However, I did want to see if there was anything good.

Sure enough, there was a perfectly good throw pillow!  So I casually grabbed it and tossed it in the trunk of my car.  I plan on putting it into a large zip-lock bag and putting it in the freezer for a day or two, to kill any nasty things that might be on it.

So why was this dive significant?  Because it helped me figure out a way to do some subtle diving in broad daylight.  Namely, bring your own trash!

Not a whole lot of trash, as it's probably not legal to add household garbage to a dumpster!  I mean, just a small amount of typical ""car trash"".  That way, if you get asked why you're there, just say you're throwing away something from Mickey D's or whatever, because you don't want to litter.  And, if someone asks you why you're taking so long, tell them you think you might have thrown away something important...ask them to help you look, then ""find"" it in your car and heave a sigh of relief. ;)

I have some intimate knowledge of the Subway franchise. They have strict regulations on bread, since they see it as one of their unique hooks in the industry.

They bake it everyday, many times a day, and IIRC can only be out for 4 hours.

Raw dough costs the owners 10 cents per 12"", not counting baking costs, so its not a big deal to them to toss it. Most owners get really good at predicting their needs, but almost always 10-20 DELICIOUS loaves get tossed every night.

Dumpster diving really is the discipline that other activities utilize such as freeganism and anticonsumption. While they are relevant discussions in their own right, dumpster diving is the practical and first-experienced application of them. In addition, it seems that every so often there are users asking questions about starting out and experienced divers are reluctant to share the goods with others.  
  
  
[/r/DumpsterDiving](http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving) seems to be moving toward an imgur trophy gallery, which is totally fine as this is the place to broadcast that, but if that is all the relevant information here, this community will not evolve.  
   
  
Proposal:  
If the members of [/r/DumpsterDiving](http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving) community agree, we should start a weekly discussion topic thread similar to other subreddits with the ultimate goal of populating a wiki to serve as a knowledge base to answer zero or first-time diver’s FAQs and the discussion threads can help keep this subreddit healthy with engaging topics that are relevant.  
  
  
Examples:  
[/r/Frugal](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/wiki/index) did this exact proposal and linked the discussion threads directly on the wiki without event compiling and formatting the data. For a while all the links were on the sidebar for visibility until they were done and then were posted on the wiki  
[/r/Cyberpunk wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/wiki/index) has an excellent knowledge base and relevant information for newcomers and does get updated  
[/r/Guns](http://www.reddit.com/r/Guns) has weekly threads for Friday Buydays (for pics), Moronic Mondays (for newbie, info questions)  
  
  
Sample Topics:  
* Where/How to Dive – How to scout locations and plot a dive plan, expected/experienced contents of types of businesses/residences (for curb diving)  
* Safety – Basic equipment for diving, specialized equipment for specific types of diving (electronics, construction, etc), Do’s and don’ts

_____________________________________________________________
- Gloves
- Headlamp or Flashlight
- Car or wagon
- A computer or a phone capable of making Kijiji listings
- some screwdrivers

**Where to look:**
___
1. Look on your city's website for electronics recycling dropoffs, either run by the city or a company like GREENTEK
2. scout the city in a car for electronics stores with unlocked dumpsters
3. Check if your local dump for an electronics recycling dropoff

**How to get started:**
___
What I do is first I go to all 3 of the greenboxes in my town, and check for anything there, a basic list of what to look for that you have any hope of reselling is:

- Laptops

- Cellphones

- Keyboards (mechanical if you can tell the difference)

- TVs and monitors, for TVs never get flatscreens, they are pretty much always broken, and CRT TVs will get you a good $10 per TV anyways

- Really anything that looks cool and you think you might be able to sell

After doing that I go to the store dumpsters, just a quick scan, they usually only have packaging, sometimes I find an old lappy or an iPhone

The last thing that you need to do has to be done during the day, and it's the most profitable, so what you do is go to the dump, dump off your shit, and bring some crappy mouse or something to dump in the pile for the dropoff, and while you are there take anything that looks sellable, the people who work there really don't care, I walked back to my car with a stack of laptops and sold them to the local pawn shop for $500 for all of them

**How to sell large quantities of something**
___

Basically I just put everything the pawn shop won't take on Kijiji and people will usually take you down on your offer, but in the end one day of diving can get you $1000 to $1500 in a day.

""I'd rather not. In my eyes nothing good can come of this for the current divers. We don't need the news putting us on display. We all have our own reasons for it and I don't feel the need to share mine with people who are most likely going to laugh about it.

- if a bag is knotted and its important not to rip it, you can usually twist the tied ends into tighter cords of sorts and *then* untie the knot.
- reinforce all boxes with liners of sorts, especially if theyve been flattened.  use a flattened box and place it in the bottom of a box your are using to carry goods.
- see if you can set up a relationship with grocery store produce departments to pick up their ""compost"" on a regular basis.  tell them its for your pigs, chickens, worm bin, whatever.  in some cases this might give you a glance on what is in the store but is on its way out.
- if you are caught red handed by the popo, be eating something as they pull up. it looks more harmless/pitiful.
- stores that change locations or remodel might throw out a lot of old stock in the process.
- apply the principle of liners to everything you do.  use cardboard as a barrier between yourself and all unwanted funk.
- if the power goes out on coolers they basically have to throw it all away.  this happens more often than you think.
- tidy up the area after yourself and the employees if you feel like appeasing them a bit.
- if its a really important dumpster (ie food), figure out their pattern of dumping.  for me, weekend nights are big and in general a lot of the good stuff goes out before lunch.  they also rarely come out in the early afternoon.",,False,self,t5_2qy4c,True,,,True,t3_f0ekh,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/f0ekh/favorite_tips_here_are_mine/,

I'm up thinking about starting my frugan blog, and this idea for a segment came to me, so I decided to post it here.

FAS mean ""For Argument's Sake."" 

I know everyone here has their own rules about what they will/won't take from a dumpster. I'd love to know where you 'draw the line' when diving.

* For me, I won't dive/take anything from inside a residential dumpster. If it's wood, glass or other such material &amp; beside the dumpster, it's fair game. 

* I also don't do fabric of any kind. What can I say; I'm from NYC, and I've heard all kinds of horror stories about the dreaded bed bugs, so I steer clear.

* No unwrapped/unpackaged/opened foods...so far. I know most produce comes unwrapped, but where I've been diving so far, I haven't taken/consumed any. I found a pineapple on my 2nd dive, and I just couldn't bring myself to eat it. 

Maybe if I find something that was just tossed in a clean plastic garbage bag &amp; separated from everything, maybe.

I'm just not there yet.

What about you?  What will you absolutely not take from the rubbish pile?

I find in a bag, close to the opening, tucked usually at the bottom of other useless, broken items, sometimes just trash bags; carefully folded women's clothes (pants, shirts, dresses/skirts) all with their tags still on. I've also found make up, chocolates, sometimes shoes and bags. More or less tucked in the same place. None of these clothes fit me, but I hand them out regardless.

It seems more likely than not that an employee is stealing stuff, ""throwing it out"" just to come back and retrieve it at a later time. 

My conflict...my imagination tells me it's stolen, but since it's in the bin, can I still grab it? Should I contact the department's manager/area manager? I don't really want to get into the awkwardness of explaining how I found these items.. Or just leave it alone and riding out the new free goods as long as it lasts?

**update** Thanks for all the replies. 
Based on my geographic location and run ins with the police in the past, it's a-ok to dive (as long as the bin is not locked). Though that possession of stolen goods is still just as risky in my area as anywhere else, so I'll probably avoid that bin for a bit. Thanks internets!

As for the store possibly locking up the bin, they're going to have a tough time doing it since the enclosure to the bin is ruined to shit (I don't think other divers did it, in fact I have never seen another diver - ever, only surfers), and the lid is all messed up (plastic bent out out of shape, the recent heat didn't help straighten it out either hehe). Funny enough, the bin with the strongest protection is the Star Bucks in the next lot over. It's got an 8ft 3-wall brick enclosure with multiple locks on the front metal gate. There's gotta be much better stuff in there if it's locked up real tight like that. It's not breaking and entering if I just enter without breaking, right?

**update 2:** The bin in question now has a chain and padlock on it. Another one I used to visit and find lots of consumer goodies (that other stupid people used to dump (high school/university) books and rolled up rugs into) is now locked up too :( 
There are however a new condo unit being built nearby, hopefully they don't use bins, but dump their garbage on the side of the curb like most other units in the area.

The grocery stores around my place have compacters so no dice there. I've checked out some fast food places, donut palaces, and pizza shops and I was wondering if anyone could explain more specifically their technique and how they deal with choosing food.  
  
 
**Technique:**  
So... What exactly do you guys do? I'm sort of fumbling around here. I mostly have been going up, lifting the lid, and I grab any bag I can reach. Then I rip it open and kind of look inside to see if there's anything there. However, I don't know if this is a very efficient way of going about things. This links to the second issue of technique
    

**Rotten Food:**  
The donut places were easy. I reached in, ripped open a bag, and found a bunch of jelly donuts. However, I can't really live on donuts and I need to cut down my sugar intake. I took the bagels I could find though. 

The pizza shops and fast food joints seem like another choice but here's the problem I'm having. How do I tell whats safe? I open these cans up and they smell awful. Okay, I know, its dumpster diving, I was expecting that. But I get real nervous about if what I'm doing is safe. I'll eat food off the floor or what ever. I'm not a germaphobe, but I'm not entirely sure what to do. Any specific pointers?

I'm not addicted but, it's nice to have. It's also expensive. So, I thought I'd share this strategy that I came up with the other day, in case anyone else is interested. I'm actually really proud of myself for thinking of it. 

You can get free used coffee grounds from many coffee shops. Starbucks does this for example. You usually just have to call them up in the morning and visit later to pick them up. The grounds are supposed to be used for composting/gardening (side note: they work great for that purpose).

But. The grounds are perfectly fine. Since they're intended for gardening, they're not going to throw in random garbage into your bag of grounds nor would they be throwing in random chemicals. So you're basically getting pure grounds that have only be used a few times and were fresh that day.

They may go bad in a few days (they're wet) but, since they're free and since coffee shops are so ubiquitous, you could easily get new grounds whenever you need them (just get them from different shops on a rotation, if you care).

I tried this with Starbucks's grounds the other day: I just put the used grounds into my coffee maker (with a new filter) and made coffee. It tasted fine (I'm not exactly a connoisseur).

Since the grounds are used already, you may have to add more grounds than you'd normally add to make coffee. You might be receiving a mix of different kinds of grounds (decaf/regular/bold/whatever) but, that doesn't matter much to me. Most of the grounds are, I imagine, whatever the cheap non-decaf coffee-of-the-day is.

Think of it this way. If someone comes and eats the food from the dumpster, they can claim it got them sick or what-have-you-not and then attempt to sue the establishment who put it there. Just because they ate something from somewhere they shouldn't have doesn't mean they can't try to sue. People have successfully sued for even more dumbass reasons...and won.

It's the same story if they try to donate it to a food shelter. Someone can claim they got sick from it and attempt to sue them. Note the word ""claim"". They don't actually have to get sick...all they have to do is claim it which can start a lawsuit process which many companies don't want to fight even if they are guaranteed to win. It still consumes time and money.

I learned this from some buddies in the military. I was speaking to some of the soldiers who were on kitchen detail and asked them what they do with the left-over foods. They *have* to dump it (although they bring as much home with them and bring a lot to families they personally know need it). They don't necessarily taint it, but it's thrown out on a military facility so no one will really get to it. 

I asked why they don't donate it and they responded with all the reasons listed above. ""Oh, the Army donated this food? They have TONS of money! I bet I can claim I got sick and try to sue them...I have nothing to lose!""

It's the assholes of the world looking for a quick buck who ruin it for everyone else. 

This can be fixed if all food donations were able to be made anonymously or if reciprocity was granted to those who donate large amounts of food...but then you run into the problem of assholes who will purposely taint donated food just to harm those who eat it.

In September ill be flying to Copenhagen to begin backpacking around Europe for 3 months. Problem is ill have very little money and will look to hitchhike, couchsurf, and (hopefully) dumpster dive on occasion for food. 

Has anyone done this in Europe?

I think I would even be successful going out back after close and talk to an employee and see if they have any extra day old food they plan to toss. 
We toss out ungodly amounts of food at the cafe I work at, so I hope same goes for those in Europe.

Thoughts?

I realized that any food I found I had to ration off in the proper sized portion for it last, meaning I couldn't over-indulge. On top of this, most of the foods I find are produce and some breads really junky food isn't as common.

Over the past 2 months I have been consuming all my lunches and 3 dinners a week on ONLY food obtained dumpster diving. This has caused me to eat with a healthier, more properly portioned diet. I have *healthily* lost 14 lbs just by changing my diet. I wouldn't have done this before, because there was no limit on what I could eat. Now, if I eat too much, I don't have enough for the week. 

tl;dr - Make part of your diet based on dumpster diving food only. You will be forced to eat portions not too large and you will not have as much junk food.

Give them no quarter - get an air mattress.,Freeganist,6,1,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/11dd0f/bedbugs_give_them_no_quarter_get_an_air_mattress/,"In addition to all of the normal remedies (laundering in hot water and drying on high heat)...

Get rid of furniture with fabric covering. 

Your computer chair? If it has padding, it has to go. Get a metal folding chair (wooden chairs can have cracks and crevices where they can live - go with metal or plastic).

Sofas and love seats? They gotta go, too.

Get an air mattress for your bed and strip all of the fabric off of your box spring.

Remove all of the carpet from the areas where you spend time (around your bed, your sofa, your computer chair, etc.).

The supporting information relevant to these solutions is as follows.

Bedbugs go through five life stages. During the transition between each stage, they must feed on blood. And, after reaching adulthood, they must feed on blood immediately prior to reproducing. As they progress from each stage to the next, they have a longer window of feeding time available. And, as adults, they can postpone their bloodfeast for up to 3 months, if necessary.

The result of this is that they typically live within 6 to 10 feet of their host and/or feeding ground. Thus, why they're called ""bedbugs"" - they live in your bed where they normally feed. (Similarly, your sofa/recliner/computer chair, where you spend long hours sufficient for them to come out for a snack.)

So, give them no quarter - nowhere to live in/around where you spend your time. 

(NOTE: In the hottest part of the summer, you can try to wrap some of these furniture items in plastic - after spraying them with chemical - and placing them in the hot sun on a concrete surface. However, this doesn't always work, and it's best to just get rid of the items until you've conquered the infestation. Then get new stuff that isn't infested.)",,False,self,t5_2qy4c,False,,,True,t3_11dd0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/11dd0f/bedbugs_give_them_no_quarter_get_an_air_mattress/,

Sun Harvest:

A cool little organic market on South Lamar. I've gotten lots of good food and drinks there. It closes around 9, they start throwing food out around 7-8 Also nearby is a Starbuck's which can be good for fruit and pastries sometimes.



Strait Music:

Music store. For some reason there is all kinds of stuff in this dumpster. I've gotten cat5 cables, lots of guitar picks, guitar strings, furniture sometimes, and other music stuff. Be careful, this dumpster is kind of in the open. Also, the Dollar Tree nearby usually has the sort of stuff you would expect to find at a Dollar Tree.



Any Subway:

They throw out all their bread at the end of the day.



Texas French Bread:

Also a good place for bread. There are several locations around town.



REI:

If you can get into the dumpster unseen, this one will have fancy camping gear sometimes. Be careful!

I'm running out of room, and I have no idea what to do with this stuff, I cannot bear throwing these things away, nor can I let them be thrown away in the bins I found them in, so here I am with this dilemma. Is there anyone in the Kansas City area that would wish to take some of these things off my hand? Perhaps a charity, or even a poor college student, or anyone at all?

So I went dumpster diving tonight, and my eyes were a bit bigger than our fridges.  We have mango juice, orange juice, strawberry juice, green juice, blueberry juice, random pink stuff, purple stuff, carrot juice, protein juice-

****WARNING- consume protein juice out of a dumpster with extreme caution.  ****

I ran into a guy in the odwalla dumpster from weiser house, an anarchist co-op.  He said he got 'stupid, stoned and drank dumpstered odwalla chocolate.'  Something about the stoned and stupid and chocolate drink made this guy pretty sick.  (Must have been the chocolate milk.)  Anyway, I did throw out most of the expired protein juice, and put a lot of it in the freezer (that is almost as good as boiling.)  Still, the protein juice might not be for the faint of heart, or stomache, or the immunocompromised, or really most reasonable people.

There is also some vegan challa (from whole foods), some odwalla bars and some potato chips (from the frito-lays dumpster.)  Ideally I'd have labelled everything as dumpstered, but I did not.

My main reason for wanting to get into this practice is the extremely tight budget I'm living on, which forces me to buy cheap, bland food.

However, I'm a little scared to start. For one thing, a quick Google and a search here told me there isn't a major community in Sudbury, Ontario, and I'm not sure where to start. Are there any restaurants/grocery stores that are well-known for being good food sources?

Secondly, I have (to put it rather bluntly) no friends, and no one to go with. The thought of venturing out to a garbage bin alone is a little scary. I've read the tips in the WikiHow. Is it normal to be nervous about the first time?

The third issue would be that I don't have a car. My transport in and around the city is purely by bus. I have a free bus pass as long as I remain a student at the university here, but my impression is that it's better to go with a headlamp, gloves, bags, thick clothing, etc. and that's a bit peculiar to carry on a bus.

The fourth question I have is in regards to the best time and day. What time throughout the day is best? My guess is early morning or late night but I really have no idea. Also, what day is usually optimal?

Nothing good comes from being able to identify yourself. If they wanna bring you in, they'll do so no matter if you identify yourself. 
* *Most* jurists have established that as long as you are not trespassing and that there is *not* a lock on the container, it's legal.
&gt;Subnote: I would still buy a tool to break the lock and take stuff as long as its from a store. Just watch out for cameras and if you break a lock and see the police, make a run for it.
* Do it in group. If you do it in group you can always back each other up and its harder for police to do something toward you if you have a lot of eye-witnesses. (Note: harder, not impossible) 
* I myself prefer to take from stores. Often these things haven't expired yet and are still in a whole bag. 
* Don't make a mess, tidy up afterwards.

Feeling pretty nervous....,chrisbluemonkey,3,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/DumpsterDiving/comments/1juk6u/so_i_need_to_go_hit_a_trader_joes_with_no_lookout/,"I've only been twice before and I've never run into anyone else.  Still, at one in a different neighborhood I was stopped by the police and now have a ""written warning"" although I'm not so sure about that.  (It was supposed to be sent to my address and hasn't showed yet.)  My plan for getting the stuff is to park in the main lot where there will be a lot of cars from the other stores in the plaza, then walk in the same direction of the metro station like some of the other employees do, ducking into the trader joe alley along the way.  I'll then fill bags and boxes, tucking them behind the dumpster, then walk back to my car and as quickly as possible load them in.  My thinking is that without the car right there I probably won't be noticed.  I wish I had some kind of semi reasonable animal to take on a leash back there that I was supposedly looking for, but I don't really.  Tortoises tend to not run away.

So does that sound like a good idea?

And what about safety?  I don't feel like I""m going to be in danger, but I'd hate to be in a bad situation.  Its a good neighborhood without homeless.  Several people have said something about taking a weapon.  I'm thinking that would really suck if I get caught by the police and I've got a weapon.
