This soup combines one of my favorite Sichuanese dishes, mapo doufu, with Japanese ramen soup. The Japanese have their own version of the Sichuanese dish called mabo tofu which is less spicy, sweet, and made with some different ingredients. I love the authentic Sichuanese version of the dish so I used that as a base instead of the altered Japanese version.  It was the best soup I've ever made, I think I may have to try more combinations like this. Recipe follows.

Ingredients:

* 2 packages chuckasoba (Japanese Chinese style noodles aka ramen)
* 1.5 tbls peanut oil
* 1/2lbs ground pork
* 1 block of soft tofu (19oz)
* 1 tbls diced ginger
* 1 tbls diced garlic
* 3 thinly sliced scallions
* 2 tbls Sichuanese chili bean paste
* 2 tbls Chinese fermented black beans
* 1.5 tsp sichuan pepper corns
* 2 tsp ground white pepper 
* 2 tsp dried chili flakes
* 1 tbls Shoaxing wine (or dry sherry)
* 1 tbls sesame oil

Sauce ingredients:

* 1 tbls dark soy
* 1 tbls light soy
* 1 tbls Chinese red vinegar
* 2 tbls mirin
* 28 oz chicken stock

Method:

Cook noodles until al dente. Rinse noodles in cold water.
Mix all soup ingredients
Toast Sichuan peppercorns in a dry wok on about mid-high for about 4-5 minutes until toasted. Grind peppercorns and add to soup.
Season your wok, put it on high, add peanut oil and heat until just smoking. Add pork and cook until almost done.

Push pork to one side of the wok, tilt and drain oil to the other side. Add chili bean paste to the oil and cook until oil is just turning red, about 20 seconds. Add garlic and ginger to the paste and cook until just fragrant. Mix everything together, move to the side, drain oil again, and add black beans, cook for about 10 seconds then slightly mash them your wok spatula. Mix everything back together. Add tofu then wine, and mix to combine while being careful not to break the tofu up.

Add pepper, chili flakes, and soup mixture. Bring to simmer and simmer for 6 minutes. Add scallions, simmer for 30 seconds, remove from heat and stir in sesame oil. Put noodles in bowl and ladle soup over them, garnish with a few pieces of scallion greens.

Serves 2-3

Disclaimer: All measurements are just an approximation.  I typically never measure and just go by sight and taste.


Add to a small pot:

Chicken (enough for a meal, I go with a chicken leg or 2)..

2 cups water (cover the chicken mostly).

1 tsp. pepper.

1 TB salt.

1/2 tsp chinese 5 spice.

1 clove minced garlic.

1 TB rice vinegar.

1 TB chili powder.

Boil everything and let it simmer until the chicken is cooked through.  15 mins maybe give or take.  Add in some rice noodles and let them cook.  Throw your junk in a bowl, top it with bean sprouts, thinly sliced onion, basil, and a sliced jalepeno.


Slightly less easy:  Same as above, except add some minced fresh ginger, and/or instead of vinegar squeeze some fresh lime juice in when you serve it.


I go with all sorts of variations:

Any type of noodle will do really.

Use rice instead of noodles.

Add spinach, lettuce, or cabbage, etc.

Instead of a jalepeno at the end, add a serrano during the cooking process.

Instead of basil, parsley or various other herbs.

Hell, add any vegetable you have on hand, either at the beginning or at the end.


Disclaimer 2: I've never fixed authentic pho in my life.  My basic version tastes rather similar to what I get at restaurants, to me anyway, but if you think it's blasphemy or whatever that's fine.  The Chinese 5 spice does give a sorta earthy taste, but it's not terrible.",,False,self,t5_2sysy,False,,,True,t3_12ebbm,http://www.reddit.com/r/asianeats/comments/12ebbm/faux_pho_super_easy/,

**BBQ Pork and Wonton Noodle Soup Recipe**

**INGREDIENTS** (serves two people with large appetites)

- Whatever [wontons](http://www.taste.com.au/images/articles/untitled-102121315.jpg) you like, you'll need 8-10 (you can make your own if you want which is pretty fun)

- Guestimated serving qty of [BBQ pork](http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/7PepCtEbQ-GI3OwCxwOPDg/l.jpg) purchased from a take away chinese store you see meat hanging in the windows (I buy $10 worth, nfi the actual qty)

- Your preferred brand of [egg noodles](http://www.visualphotos.com/photo/2x2341252/pasta_-_asian_noodles_-_egg_noodles_pas055.jpg) (don't use 2min noodles, there are much better ones you can find in asian grocery stores)

- Bunch of [Pak choy](http://www.wingyipstore.co.uk/pictures/content1479/baby+pak+choi.jpg) with most of white portion cut off so you just have the green leaves (or bok choy or other leafy spinach like vegetable)

- 1 small Carrot julienned 

- Teaspoon-ish of thinly sliced Ginger root

- Small bunch of [spring onion](http://www.foodsubs.com/Photos/greenonions5.jpg)

- Handfull [dried sliced shitake mushrooms](http://www.asianfoodgrocer.com/img/prods/dried-foods/296006-mushroom-slice-lg.jpg)

- [Chinese rice wine](http://www.foodsubs.com/Photos/chinesericewine.jpg) (can use dry sherry if you can't find it)

- 2L Chicken stock

- Soy sauce

- [Fish Sauce](http://www.siaea.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/fish-sauce.jpg)

- [Shrimp paste](http://www.shoptheeast.com/1111-325-large/lee-kum-kee-shrimp-sauce-finely-ground-8-oz.jpg) &lt;-- very important, this stuff really improves the broth's flavour

**METHOD**

Start making the broth by adding chicken stock, a couple of ugly looking slices of BBQ pork, small handful of rehydrated shitake mushrooms, 2x 2inch spring onion stems (the white bit, not the green leaf), and thinly sliced ginger to a pot on a medium heat and bring to a simmer. Simmer for a few minutes then taste.. it probably won't have a full brothy flavour.. yet.

Add a generous dash of soy sauce and chinese rice wine, a dash of fish sauce, and a quarter of a teaspoon of shrimp paste. Now taste. You should start getting a fuller flavour you'd expect from a good broth. 

Now it's time to tweak the flavour. 

Season with salt and I usually add a little more soy sauce and incrementally more shrimp paste until the broth has a good [umami](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umami) flavour. Once it's to your liking, turn the heat down and leave at a gentle simmer while you prepare the rest of the dish.

Rehydrate the egg noodles as per packet instructions (3 bulbs of egg noodles is a decent serving for 2 people) With the egg noodle I use the packet says 3min in boiling water to soften, but they are still hard as a rock, so just do what you need to do to make them al dente.

Bring a saucepan of water to the boil and cook your wontons, be sure to poke them around as soon as you add them as they have a tenancy to stick to each other and the pot. I purchase mine frozen from a local asian grocer and they take around 5-6minutes to be cooked.

**ASSEMBLY**

Add cooked wontons to bottom of large bowls. Add noodles, leaning to one side of the pot (leaving a gap on the other side) In this gap, arrange bok choy , juliened carrots and BBQ pork. Ladle in broth to a decent level (try to leave behind all the floaty broth additives you don't really want them in your bowl). Garnish with diagonally sliced spring onion.

BAM! Serve and impress!

I'm from Singapore, and I grew up in a [peranakan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peranakan) household, so most of the food I cook is a mixture of chinese/malayan cuisine.

That said, I'm quite the lazy cook, so my favourite dishes are usually stir fry, with a small amount of prep time. Once cooked, served with white rice.

These are my must-haves in the kitchen:

* Garlic
* Red Onions
* Shallots
* Ginger
* Light Soy Sauce
* Dark Soy Sauce
* Oyster Sauce
* Worcestershire Sauce
* Sesame Oil

With these, I can make decent, tasty meals with leafy vegetables, chicken and pork. Some of my favourite dishes like [Sesame Oil Chicken](http://rasamalaysia.com/recipe-sesame-oil-chicken/2/) can be made with just these ingredients.    
  


For some added flavour and complexity, you can try adding these into your recipes:

* Kecap Manis (Sweet Sauce)
* Chinese Rice Wine
* Thai Fish Sauce
* Dried Chinese Mushrooms
* Ikan Bilis (Anchovy)

What do you have in your kitchen? :)",,False,self,t5_2sysy,True,,,True,t3_liib1,http://www.reddit.com/r/asianeats/comments/liib1/what_are_your_asian_kitchen_staples/,

It was undercooked, making it somewhat crunchy, but at the same time, was mushy and pasty on the outside! And to make matters worse, the nigiri was formed by molds or machine, not by hand! I was beside myself. At least the fish was fresh, so I converted the nigiri to sashimi by discarding the rice, and made the best of it.

Now I won't pretend I'm an expert at making perfect sushi rice, but I could have made much better sushi rice at home (and have).

Big fan of Chinese food here, so I'll give it a shot on how to do it.  This sure isn't gourmet I'd imagine, but it's supremely healthy, and by my experience constitutes 90% or so of a typical south eastern Chinese person's home cooked dinners.

Without further ado, aquire:  white rice, leafy greens, tofu, a meat product or 5, corn starch or flour or some sort of thickening agent, other vegetable matter which could be most anything, soy sauce or fish sauce or oyster sauce or black bean paste or all of the above, garlic, onions, go nuts on this junk as long as it's mostly vegetables.

3 or 5 dishes are going to come out of this depending on how many people you're feeding.  The first dish always it seems to me is going to be some leafy greens.  You oil up a pan, probably a wok mostly if we're talking traditional, you add a bit of garlic, add some ground pork or something meaty, take it easy on the meat as it's expensive and mostly for flavour, you add some sauce you like, a bit of thickener perhaps, add your leafy greens, you wilt the greens and you're good.

Second dish, you might start it off with onions, carrots, bean sprouts, some craziness mushrooms or some other type of fungal growth (reconstitute those suckers), add some worms (the little dried worms with eyes that are actually fish), or just add some type of meat again for flavour, and that's dish 2.

Then you're going to go with a tofu dish.  Soup would be one way, that lotus root pork junk is awesome, or it could be something similar to dish 2 but with completely different or the same vegetables and tofu added on.

You're going nuts and adding more dishes?  It will be some variation of the above.  Do watch out for bitter melon or whatever it is as I've found most jerks can't cook it right.

Anyhow, get yourself a bowl, fill it with rice, add the junk you cooked on top and consume.  Put that bowl right up to your mouth and shovel it in with chopsticks and make crazy noises like you've been starving for weeks.

When it's cranked about half way and I put peanut oil in, it smokes, turns brown, and becomes foul smelling almost instantly.  I usually start the wok far below this point to avoid the smoking, then turn it up to medium-high once the meat is in to sear it (or medium low for vegetables so the liquid they release evaporates quickly).  

Now, I don't have many problems with this method, but I notice it varies drastically from how it's done in a Chinese restaurant.  The place I frequent has an open kitchen and I often watch the cook.  The flames are much huger than mine, licking up all the way to the edges of the wok.  The cook also seems to never adjust the intensity.  On the other hand, my flames come up about 1/2 of the wok at the highest I dare to crank it.  Despite my heat being excessive, I've read that most commercial wok ranges are in the 120,000 BTU range.  

**Main question**: If medium heat on my 65k burner burns my oil, how does a blasting 120k commercial range not ruin the food with a burnt oil taste?

Spam is life.  Spam is everything good in this world.  So it kimchi.  I could eat kimchi with anything and it will still be delicious.

Ingredients:
**Kimchi** - depending on how much you want to eat.
** Spam **- 1/2 can - 1 can depending on how much rice you are gonna eat.
** White rice **- measure by bowl aka how much rice you want to eat.
** Sesame oil**
** sesame seeds**
** garlic**
** egg**
* *other veggies you want to add.**

1) Get kimchi, cut them up into rectangles.  Get spam, cut them up into cubes.  Get rice and place it on the side and in a bowl somewhere.

2) Heat up your frying pan and place sesame oil and spam.

3) Once spam looks about half cooked, place cut kimchi and veggies into the pan.

4) Once you let it cook for about 4-5 mins continually stirring, add rice into pan with garlic + salt and mix the contents inside with the rice.

5) After rice has been well mixed with the other stuff, make a hole in the middle and crack an egg.  Once egg is in the middle, resume mixing it into the rest of the rice.

6) After all the rice and eggs and spam and kimchi has been all mixed, place it all on a dish.  Sprinkle with sesame seeds.

Actually I've never seen it, but have heard of it being used in China.  But it's only the very very poor who do so, and half the time I think it's solely the rice husks that they use and not even actual rice.

So does anyone else use brown rice at all in their cooking?  Me, I've even used it to make maki rolls and whatnot.  The reason being, brown rice is much more healthy.  With over 6 times the amount of fiber, less carbs, 4 times the amount of many vitamins and minerals, there's no comparison.  Sure, there is enriched white rice I believe, but to me that's just silly.

Perhaps it's simply a taste thing?  But heck, even wild rice can be awesome.  Convenience as white rice cooks faster?  Although I'd find that hard to believe.  It can't be an economic, as white rice takes more processing, no?  Anyone with any insight?

And yeah, I realize this isn't all that big of a deal as the Asian diet seems to be quite quite healthy overall regardless.  It certainly beats gorging on Big Macs and Taco Bell anyhow, but still I'm curious.

EDIT: so I've been doing a bit of research here and it seems like you guys are right, it's simply a status thing that perhaps started in the 17th century or so with the upper classes.  But then there's also the fact that white rice has a longer shelf life.",,False,self,t5_2sysy,True,,,True,t3_lbu1u,http://www.reddit.com/r/asianeats/comments/lbu1u/brown_rice/,

Just follow a simple sushi rice recipe on the internet, hell I used the one off the back of the seasoned rice wine vinegar bottle.  you can adjust whatever recipe you find to match your tastes.

The Nori that I buy has pictorials on the package showing you how to make hand rolls.  Traditional sushi is the easiest, make a small ball of rice with your hand, square it off, add a dab of wasabi, and add your favorite fish (sliced against the grain) to the top.

As far as rice is concerned, I use Calrose rice.  You really don't need to wash it to use it.  Use a plastic or wooden bowl (never metal) to mix in your vinegar and fold your rice so you don't mash the grains.

I'm not talking down to anyone, I don't make award winning sushi by any means, I'm just saying, don't be affraid to fail and do some homework.  The process of learning how to do it is the fun part.  And trust me, the failures are still fun to eat, as you learn what you like and don't.

It's served with rice and lettuce leaves.

I just made this tonight, and after about 15 minutes of searching for the recipe, it turns out I can't really find one that matches the dish I know and love. ([This one comes close](http://taste-for-adventure.tablespoon.com/2011/01/10/thai-larb-gai/), but has too much focus on chilis and adds cilantro, which... no, just no). So I figured I'd share the recipe I know with you guys.

**Laab**

Ingredients:

* **1 lb ground Meat** (pref. Pork, but Chicken is also good)
* **2 limes**
* **2 medium-sized shallots**
* 3-5 sprigs (or ~10-15 large leaves) of **fresh mint** OR **fresh Keffir lime leaves** (if you can't find fresh Keffir lime leaves, then just stick with mint)
* **1 tbsp Fish Sauce** (pref. Tipparos)
* **Crushed Asian Red Chili flakes** (to taste)
* **3 tbsp uncooked rice for Toasted Rice Powder** (OR pre-made Toasted Rice Powder, if you already have it made, or can find it in the store)
* **2 cups rice** (pref. Thai jasmine rice) to cook.
* **1 head** of green leaf or Boston lettuce (either works; I prefer Boston for flavor, but green leaf stands up to scooping better. Your choice)

What you'll need:

* A large pot (not a stockpot, but a saucepan or pot large enough to fit all the ground meat easily)
* If making the toasted rice powder yourself: a coffee grinder used for spices, or a mortar and pestel. Or any way you can think to make a powder out of something (eg: a blender works okay, and I have before used a hammer and 2 ziplock bags); plus a frying pan.

**First: Toasted (or Roasted) Rice Powder (TRP)**

If you don't have this already or can't find it in the store, then you'll need to make some from scratch. Don't worry, it's not too hard, and you can make a good amount to use for this dish in the future (it saves very well). [This page has a good example of making TRP](http://taste-for-adventure.tablespoon.com/2011/01/10/thai-larb-gai/ ""But seriously, ignore the rest of the recipe... it's overloaded with peppers."") with photos of what it should look like.

1. Put 3 tablespoons (or more!) of uncooked dry rice into your frying pan over medium heat.
2. Once it starts to heat up, stir or toss constantly to keep it in motion.
3. Continue to cook until rice turns a nice toasty brown. Approximately 10-15 minutes.
4. Remove from heat; allow rice to cool for 5-10 minutes
5. Place rice in coffee grinder/blender/mortar and pestel and grind/blend/smash until it's approximately the consistency of beach sand.
6. (Optional) If you can't quite get the rice fine enough, I like to sift it through a coarse mesh strainer, then continue pulverizing the large pieces that are left behind.

Once you're done the toasted rice powder should be [a nice golden brown color like this](http://taste-for-adventure.tablespoon.com/files/2011/01/2011-01-10-thailarbgai-larbgai05-500w.jpg) and smell quite roasty. Give it a taste! This is one of the primary (though subtle) flavors of Laab.


**Second: Rice**

1. Cook the rice. (This is important; you have no idea how many times I get to the end and smack myself in the head after forgetting this step).


**Finally: Laab**

*Prep:*

1. *Slice* the shallots into fine slices. Once sliced, chop them 2-3 times further. Keep the shallot bits fairly large, but separated.
2. Remove the mint leaves from the sprigs, rinse, and chop finely.
3. Squeeze the juice from the 3 limes (I've heard microwaving limes for 5 seconds helps bring the juice out; also rolling them on the table. Use your best judgement, or better yet, a juicer or citrus reamer).

*Cook:*

1. Place the ground meat in the large pot and cook over medium heat. If it starts to stick to the bottom of the pan, add a splash of water to keep it moist.
2. Stir meat frequently as it cooks, breaking it up into fine pieces.
3. Once meat is cooked all the way through (7-10 minutes) **remove from heat** but keep it in the pan.
4. Stir in chopped shallots and chopped mint (or Keffir lime leaf)
5. Add lime juice
6. Sprinkle about 2 tbsp toasted rice powder over the mixture, while stirring.
7. Add the Fish Sauce (be careful not to add too much; add about half, then taste. If it tastes salty and rich, don't add more. See tips section for more).
8. Finally, add the chili flakes, tasting until it's spicy enough for ya.
9. Serve over rice, and have lettuce leaves available for wrapping/eating with.

**Tips:**

Yes, tips. This is a somewhat inexact recipe. It's based on memory, and my general proportions, and I can guarantee that if you use the exact amounts above it *will* be magically delicious, but there are some adjustments you can make.

The flavor should be a combination of a few things: Tart, Toasty, Salty, Fresh, and Spicy. Basically you're looking for the flavors of the meat, lime, toasted rice, shallot, and mint to shine through; all enhanced by the magic ingredient of Fish Sauce. Basically the fish sauce is the make or break here. 

The one mistake I always make is *too much fish sauce* as that generally makes things taste salty and a little off (""fishy"" if you will), so go easy on it to start. However too little fish sauce is also a problem, as it adds a lot of the ""magic"" to the dish, with important salts and meaty goodness, sort of like bouillon does for soups. Experiment to add just the right amount, but 1 tablespoon is a conservative number that's a good start.

Also it's important to note the brand of fish sauce: Tipparos is my personal favorite and the only one that tastes familiar to me for Laab; but there are lots to choose from. [Here's a list of the only brands you should really look for](http://importfood.com/sati7501.html); don't bother with American ""thai cooking"" brands.

Lime juice and Shallots are the other two variables: generally with Lime juice, if it needs a bit more ""oomph"" or tartness to balance the saltiness, I'll add another tablespoon or so of lime juice. 

With shallots, basically two should be enough. If you only have one shallot, it's going to be a little lacking in the onion department. I'm of the opinion that shallot is something that can't be substituted in Laab, but if you really don't have them, you could try red onions or other onions. But you have been warned.

**How to eat:**

Generally I just throw this over rice in about a 1:1 proportion and chow it down, munching at a lettuce leaf in my hand. Alternatively, if you have the patience, you could dish the Laab and rice into a lettuce leaf and wrap it up and eat it that way, but generally I'm too busy enjoying it to care how the Laab gets to my mouth. Lettuce is a fresh afterthought.

Full credit here goes to a good Thai friend of mine who shall remain unnamed, but introduced me to this dish which I now consider one of my favorite meals of all time. It's got a certain addictiveness that you're sure to discover.

Obviously everyone has their own recipe, but I've tried a LOT of them, and this is what I was taught by a filipino chef.

2 shallots, very thin julienne

1 carrot, sm. dice

1/2 red bell pepper, sm. dice

1/2 tsp ginger, minced

3-4 tsp veg oil

Saute that up, until the carrots start to soften, then add:

2 cups cooked rice

2 tsp salt

1 tsp pepper


Stir that around and break up the rice.  Give it like 10 mins of cooking &amp; stirring before adding:

~2 tsp soy sauce

~3 tsp sesame oil

~2 tsp sriracha

The important thing here is to not add too much soy sauce.  Start with a little, stir it up &amp; taste.  You can always add more!  The sesame oil gives it a very nicely rounded flavor.

With a seperate pan (nonstick), get it very, very hot w/a little veg oil and drop in 2 eggs, scrambled.  If that pan is correctly hot, you should be able to just whisk them up for 10 - 15 seconds, until about 1/2 cooked.

Well, I love yum cha (hitting a dim sum place), but that's certainly not an everyday thing.  Yum cha pro tip: go nuts filling your companion's tea cups, and when they do the same for you tap two fingers, the index and the middle, on the table and this is how you say ""thanks for filling my tea again jerk"".  Ha, or just order lots of beer and the waiters will hook you up instead.

Back to congee, it's really really simple.  You take some rice, add some broth, and heat it up until you have a rather watery porridge.  This is basically it.

Unless you're poor as hell though, you are going to want to go with more than just plain old porridge I'd imagine.  So what else to add?  It could be most anything, so go nuts.  Dried seafood, various vegetables, eggs, meats, herbs, spices, sauces, hell you name it and someone probably does it.  What I enjoy about Chinese cooking, what I've witnessed anyway, is that a lot of the time people seem to go with either what they have on hand or what the guy down stairs happens to be selling on a particular day.

Want to easily get started?  Adding a raw egg, green onions, and a dash of soy sauce, is very easy on a western palette.  If you haven't already and you want to try congee, start here.

Me, I love love love Pickled veggies in congee.  Pickled mustard greens in particular are just spectacular.

Ha, if you're hitting a restaurant, never go with stinky tofu.  And don't go with century eggs either.  Or by all means.  It's your funeral.

The recipe here makes a very healthy version and is MSG free.

___


Add about 2 tbsp olive oil and heat on high heat until the wok is ready to go.

1. Stir fry about 0.5 lb ground pork in a wok for a few min.
2. Add in 1 package of tofu (I prefer medium) cut into small cubes about 1 cm^3.  Also add in about 1/3 a bag of shelled frozen soy beans.
3.  Now for the sauce.  Add in about 1 tsp-1tbsp of sichuan pepper.  There are a few options at this point but the easiest is to add in like 4 tbsp of sriracha chili sauce, which comes in a screw top jar.  Alternatively, asian grocery stores sell packets of sauce for making Ma Po Dofu.  They taste great but are really heavy on the MSG so I usually make my own sauce using the sriracha and whatever else I have on hand.

Here's what I came up with, I'd love to know what you think.

Ingredients:

1.2kg of stewing beef

½ cup of light soya sauce

½ cup of dark soya sauce

1 cup of water

2 tbs of rice wine

a few slices of ginger – medium thickness

2 cloves of garlic – roughly chopped

a large pinch of five spice

a pinch of Sichuan black pepper

2 star anise pods – best if put in a bouquet garni pouch for easy removal

a pinch of red chilli

Method:


Cut the beef into large chunks, rove a bit of the fat if the meat is very fatty, but make sure you leave some for flavour.


Boil the meat in water for a few minutes until it starts changing colour and the water becomes foamy, remove the meat and rinse it, this will have gotten rid of some of the impurities.


Place all the ingredients in a slow cooker or large pot and cook on very low temperature. Avoid the temptation to add more liquid, it’ll seem like there isn’t much in the pot but it will suffice. Stir occasionally to make sure the meat is getting properly coated in the soya sauce and spices and to stop it from sticking to the bottom of your pot. After a couple of hours of braising, the liquid should all be gone and most of the fat and gristle will have dissolved into the dish. At this point you should remove the star anise and any bones and solid gristle. Muddle the meat with your wooden spoon to break it up a little so the dish become chunky but of a similar consistency.


Serve with Jasmine rice and chopped spring onions.

I also have really good Japanese and Indian cookbooks and a decent, but small Chinese one.  I don't have a good Thai cookbook, I'd love any recommendations for one.  I have already made Paneer Palak with Paratha, which came out okay, and Pad Thai, which came out very well but I intend to make again.  (I didn't do it properly, I used a pre-made ""Pad Thai Paste"" because I couldn't get the damn fish sauce jar open.)  If anyone has any ideas of what I should make, let me know, because I'd really like to experiment more.  I'm considering making Kitsune Udon next week.

Starches: Flat udon, Round udon, Thin Thai Rice Noodles, Jasmine Rice.

Sauces/Pastes: Tamarind Paste, Fish Sauce, Sweet and Sour Plum Sauce, Red Chili Paste, Coconut Milk, Miso, Mirin, Rice Vinegar, Soy Sauce, Sesame Oil.

Dry ingredients:  Kombu, Dried Shitake Mushrooms, Nori, Bonito flakes.

Spices:  Coriander, Cardamom, Garam Masala, Madras Curry Powder, Garlic Powder, Tumeric.

Fresh Ingredients: Garlic, Ginger, Spinach, Yams (American, not Japanese), Mangoes, Chicken

I intend on going to the Asian grocery store to get Inari, scallions, and short grain sushi rice later in the week.  Is there anything else I should have for Japanese, Thai, or Indian cooking that I am drastically missing?  What recipes should I try?
