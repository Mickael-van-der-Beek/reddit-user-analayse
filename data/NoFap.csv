1356746994.0,1468,self.NoFap,15lrh7,16 habits you should do EVERYDAY. (This changed my life) [FIXED],RedanSam,1987,519,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/15lrh7/16_habits_you_should_do_everyday_this_changed_my/,"**1 Exercise** – Exercise is huge. I briefly touched on what happens to you in the short term but consider also the long term effects of regular exercise. As you maintain a regiment of exercise your body fat percentage drops, your flexibility and strength increase (less chance of injury) your lifespan extends, your immune system is bolstered, you maintain your youth longer, you carry over a sustained vigor to other parts of your life, your resting heart rate goes down, and you have a general feeling of well being. Pretty sweet. Clearly exercising is very important; given both its short and long term benefits. 

But do you have to do this every day? That seems strenuous. Try expanding your definition - You don’t give it your 100% every day. Some days may be 10 minutes of simple light stretching, just to keep the habit. Other days may be 2.5 hour monster gym sessions.

I use this habit to help me accomplish two other things very important to me, mediation and getting in nature. Often times my physical exertion is a one hour walk through the park or along the water front. Practicing a walking meditation is a great way to center yourself and help carry the skill over to everyday life. Being in nature has a similar balancing effect on your well being. 

But you don’t need me to tell you to work out. The benefits are all clearly documented by scientists and people. There are networks and resources for support and endless sources of inspiration to motivate you. 

**2 Meditation** – This habit is fucking HUGE. You need to meditate. Think about what part of the human experience spirituality addresses – the ego and fear – two concepts that are SO tied up with hitting on girls. I think a lot of people get messed up here because the benefits are very intangible at first. The “S curve” of Mastery that I described above has a very looong period of ‘sucking shit’. If you’re not experienced then your image of what meditation should be like is wrong. Fighting your expectations will be a constant battle as you learn to meditate. Here are some resources to help you learn. 
Reddit Article – Very concise introduction to meditation Mindfulness in Plain English – Amazing book that covers the topic clearly and in depth. 

Meditation Retreat – 10 day intensive mediation retreat Holosync – Tapes that induce a meditative state (great training wheels) A fortuitous person may discover means of acquiring the audio. (make sure its .flac and not .mp3 format + listen with good headphones) Practice – Hurr durr. Start meditating everyday. The evidence is in by a landslide, both anecdotally and empirically. Meditation will change your life so start today, any reason your not is an excuse. 

Once you get the hang of it you will leave your meditation sessions feeling centered, calm, and relaxed. It has an ego-lessening effect and awareness increasing effect that spills over to your everyday life. If you keep up the practice you’ll notice that your focus and attention span increases dramatically, as does your sight and sound sensitivity (think of the most visceral things you do – sex, eating, sports etc.) Brain regions associated with attention, interoception and sensory processing will literally [url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361002/ ]become thicker[/url]. 

In the long term, meditation offers a ‘profound transformation of how you experience reality’ It will bring you joy, peace, and happiness. This is real and you need to be doing it.


**3 Reading** - If you read the right books you will be moved, inspired, and motivated.

Think about what you expose yourself to. There’s a million shitty blogs on the interent written by whoever. But then theres books out there that will change your life. Books that the most gifted human beings on earth have spent years writing. A lifetime of experience, insights, and lessons learned given to you in a nice handheld easily digestible form. :) 

I started this habit at a half hour a day. Recently I’ve started reading about an hour a day and am burning through books. With a constant flow of information in you increase your ability for information to flow out (applying knowledge to your life)

Reading is an easy habit to put off and you need to make it a priority. If you’re not regularly reading then you may start to fall asleep as you pick up a book. Your mind is not conditioned properly and you need to force yourself through that period. Your reading speed and comprehension do pick up over time – just stick to it.

**4 Creative Recreation** - People are going to approach this one very differently but if there is something you can sit down and do purely for your enjoyment than that’s awesome. Think of a flow state activity that you can put your full expression into. For me it’s playing an instrument. If you’ve ever seen someone play the guitar or piano at an extremely high level in a non performance setting then you’ll know what I’m talking about. The “S” curve of learning an instrument is very, very, very long. But you get out what you put in. Your amusements will leave you feeling rejuvenated and can often break up and lighten the day. As you invest in your hobbies you will get more and more out of them

I generalized this habit as ‘creative recreation’ because I want to emphasize the fact that recreation is not a spectator sport. Vegetating on the couch watching commercials is not recreation. 

**5 Nutrition** - As you build a productive life your ability to stay focused and have energy becomes very important. What you eat has a huge effect on how you feel. If you eat right you can avoid energy crashes, fight off sickness, and generally just feel ‘good’.

I know that I’m definitely not the best person to give nutrition advice but the resources are out there. It should be obvious that what you put in your body is very important. Do yourself a favor and learn how your body works.
For me, I don’t eat sugar or processed food. I drink 1.5L of water a day and I make an extra effort to eat more plant based foods. I supplement my diet with fish oil etc. I think what’s most important though is that you proactively decide what you put in your body. Make the time to cook your meals, keep your fridge stocked, and don’t buy convenience food.


**6 Reasonable Spending** - Like nutrition, this habit is more of a choice you make rather than an active investment of your time. Its pretty straight forward, every day I try to manage my money reasonably. 

Apply the concept of reactivity/proactively to your spending and you have an excellent framework for managing your money. Did you plan on making this purchase? If not then don’t do it. The nature of planning a purchase is that it is in line with your goals and budget. The nature of making an impulsive/reactive purchase is quite the opposite, ‘it is right here and will satisfy me right now’ (mostly consumer/convenience items )


**7 Brain Buster + Current Events** - Part of my morning routine is to check out the economist, my local news site, or the new york times and read two or three articles. Given my background and where I want to go in life it is going to serve me well to be informed and have the ability to notice trends and understand the complexity of global issues. 

I also work very hard to develop my critical and lateral thinking. Every day I challenge myself to solve one extremely difficult problem. Actually I only figure them out about 30% of the time. On my computer I have a repository of IQ, Mensa, brain buster type books that would take a lifetime to work through. Some problems I solve in five minutes others take me thirty until I break down and look at the solution. 

If you run a business or are any kind of decision making authority (or eventually want to be in that position) then I can’t vouch enough for this habit. You need to be sharp and informed. Period.


**8 Socia**l - Every day I make an effort to advance my social skills. Your ability to communicate effectively with human beings has so many implications in your personal and professional life. I’ve gone through experiments with this habit and I think the less your around people the more you need to make it a priority (my lifestyle right now has me around new people ALL the time, but there have been other times in my life when I actively had to make that happen)

I’ve tried a few different things. For a while I really focused on listening to people with the intent to understand, pushing the urge to get my point across aside and giving other people the floor when they were expressing themselves. I’ve done different experiments with eye contact and physicality while communicating as well. Regardless, going out and approaching trumps all when it comes to developing your social skills. 


**9 Personal Management** - This is the easiest of all habits to implement. Just 10 minutes a day and your bachelor pad is looking clean and fresh. Not many long term benefits here except maybe you don’t lose your possessions as often and they have and increased lifespan. In the short term doing your laundry, not letting your dishes pile up, and making your bed can offer you a peace of mind and allow you to work unfestered on other projects.


**10 Project 1, 2 or more times a week** - For me I set aside a two hour block twice a week to work on a personal project. This could be fleshing out a business feasibility plan, recreating my weightlifting routine, catching up on some reading, creating a budget, doing research, or writing a mega post for rsd :)

At the beginning of each week I choose what two projects I plan to work on and within the week I find time to fit them in. Use this habit as a way of revitalizing old projects that are collecting dust or to begin something new that you’ve been thinking about but haven’t got around to.

The effects this habit has on your short and long term productivity are huge. 


**11 Podcast/TED Talk/University Lecture** - If you’re a thinking human being with a desire for knowledge then you should be listening to podcasts, watching ted talks and viewing the thousands of lectures professors and researchers have on the internet.

This is a habit I integrated for both its short term and long term benefits. In the short term I find it interesting to learn about new topics. A lot of times it’s on a subject I’m interested in at the time, other times its something completely new. Either way I’m exposing myself to the best and brightest minds of today and expanding my understanding of the world.

If you engaged yourself with this material every day, what would the long term effects be? Besides a vast and varied wealth of knowledge you would begin to draw disciplines together. Your understanding and awareness would grow so large that the value and wisdom you could offer other people would be incredible. 

*For a practical tip, throw a queue of talks you’re interested in on your ipod and listen while exercising. 


**12 Language** - Every day I spend thirty minutes learning a new language. This is an ongoing task that I struggled to integrate. You realize almost no immediate benefit and that makes it exceptionally difficult to do every day. The “S” curve of mastery is very, very long (years).

But alas, the benefits in the long term must be exceptionally rewarding. I can only speculate as I currently only speak one language, but from my time studying in Italy I can tell you I would have got a lot more out of the experience had I spoke the language. Coming from a business perspective being bi/multi-lingual would likely be a huge advantage. 

For me, I intend to spend a large part of my life travelling. If you expect to live another 50/60 years of life on this earth then imagine the lifetime of opportunities and experiences other languages may open you up to. Don’t cut yourself off. 

For some practical advice getting started I recommend the rosetta stone. It’s a visual program that is a great way for getting you started. Listen to talk radio (via internet) and get a language book with exercises to help you practice. Get a women your seeing to join in. It accelerates the process so much if you have someone to practice speaking with. 

We are the first generation with ready access to the internet. The resources to help you pick up a language are out there and they are free – use them.

Here's the best part: You can channel that change and focus it on your sex life, if you choose to, and it will get you laid. IF you do it correctly, that is.... and don't cheat.

Here's how: you have a primal, almost irresistible urge to procreate. That biological urge, when mixed with your testosterone, is intended to motivate you to jump out of bed in the morning ready to fight and fuck your way through the herd, leaving vanquished foes and satiated hoes in your wake. Unfortunately, our advanced brains and opposable thumbs over time have discovered an almost perfect and flawless cheat: Masturbation. After all, it's so much easier, so much less of a hassle, to simply cut all the corners, skip through the level, and polish that platinum trophy really fast until the end credits roll.

Here's where this wonderful thing we're discovering called NoFap comes in: You, being the horny, over-sexed, perverted woman crazy fiend that you are, have a choice in how you get off.: Your hand or a vagina. You may feel like only one of those choices is viable, but that's merely because it's the EASY choice, so it appears to be the preferred one. Guess what: If you actually stop jerking off, and I mean STOP - eliminate it as a possibilty from your life (as I and many others have) - your sex starved brain and testicles will literally lead you out into the world and between the legs of a female. It just HAPPENS. Try it, you numbskull. You'll see that I speak the truth.

""But....but.... Chinesegangster, that's easy for you to say but I have bad acne, back hair, a harelip, and my breath smells like a circus chimp's used diaper!""

 Fine. Lower your standards and look again. The only reason your standards are so irrationally high in the first place is because of that damn computer screen you've been sitting in front of half your life. Hint: now that you're no longer wasting your life in your comfy jerk-off chair, you will have plenty of time to apply Clearasil, shave your ape nape, and brush your teeth. NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, THERE ARE REAL WOMEN OUT THERE WHO WILL HAVE SEX WITH YOU. They're just waiting for you to poke your head into their personal space and say ""Hello beautiful. You look bored. Can I help you with that?"" Don't believe me? Go to the Manga section at Barnes and Noble right now. There are three (3) nerdy girls on the floor at this very moment feeling lonely and unattractive, faces pressed into some crappy Japanese rape comic, dreaming of the day that someone like you comes along and says those exact words.

Stop mentally objecting to the wisdom of what I'm saying and automatically trying to make yourself the exception to this absolute rule. You're not different, you're not unique, and you're not a hopeless case. You're a MAN, and mother nature wants your penis to hang out inside wet vaginas. PORN HAS BEEN COCKBLOCKING YOU FROM YOURSELF. SNAP OUT OF IT! Stop jerking off, and sex will happen to you. You will do it for yourself on an unconscious and biological level and you will literally marvel as it's happening. And it will be FUN. Trust me, meeting and flirting with young women may be effort, but it sure as hell isn't work.

After I hit 90, I felt a lack of motivation to continue the challenge. ""I'm not feeling the effects, I wanna fap cause I haven't in a while, I can totally keep changing my life while fapping to porn, it's not that big of a difference."" 

So I stopped and decided to fap until I wanted to go back to NoFap, if ever. This time has come recently, but if there's one thing it has taught me, it has taught me that addiction is very strong.

You see, I forgot how strong of a hold it has on you. All of the sudden, I was relapsing like my first ever time at NoFap all over again. I forgot my own tips and tricks. So in finding my old notes from my 90 day challenge, I remembered what they are.

Disclaimer- 

If you were feeling sufficient effects of no fap, but no longer do, this is because you have gotten used to being awesome. If you feel amazing for a long time, it will get mundane. So you need to spice it up or you will feel mediocre again. This leads to my first major tip, in no particular order:

-Work out. At least 3 times a week.

The thing with working out, is that so many people associate it with getting girls to like you. ""Why would I work out so much"", they say ""I don't want to impress girls so much!"". So they don't work out. Or the opposite side of the spectrum: 

&gt; I workout because I wanna look good for the girls man.

That's not what working out should be for. That's not the guide to happiness. That's a guide to dependence. You should want to work out to improve your health, life, and to improve yourself. Nothing's more satisfying then looking in the mirror and liking the person you see. If you aren't comfortable with your body, you're not going to like the person you see. If you start working out, you're going to like the way you look. I guarantee it. This leads into the next one:

- Erase your dependency. Especially on girls and sex.

The prevailing mentality on NoFap is dangerous. Very much so. I see posts all the times that say ""I got girls man. NoFap is working perfectly!"" Which is fine. Be happy, sure. What I also see is posts that say "" I don't have superpowers, girls don't like me, this **doesn't work**.""

NoFap is not a journey to get girls to touch your penis. It is a personal and spiritual journey in a lot of ways. If you are dependent on the love of girls, then you are setting yourself up for failure because girls will not ALWAYS want you. And when you fuck up or get rejected, your grip on the challenge will falter. Listen:

Happiness isn't about girls. The moment you realize you can go on for the rest of your life unmarried but still happy is the moment you erase that dependence.  The belief that sex is so important is one of the biggest reasons people relapse. Because they can't control their lust. Your testes will not explode if you don't jack off or fuck something. You can be happy with yourself, by yourself.  Be dependent on yourself. You don't need approval from anyone but yourself. And also, when you start believing this, girls tend to like you more because they can tell you aren't needy. How so? Because you don't act like this girl is quite possibly your only chance to fuck for the rest of your life and you don't act like you can't blow this or it's all over. Become self reliant. And:

- Become congruent.

There's a principle called Cognitive Dissonance in psychology. It's when you perceive something that sends two conflicting messages. When this happens, it really fucks your brain up because you can't tell what is true and what is false. Here's an example:

&gt; I wanna stay on NoFap, but at the same time I wanna jack off.

Two conflicting messages. Sad, mad, and conflicting thoughts are like weeds for your mental state. If not destroyed, they grow and fuck up your mind. So, eliminate negative thoughts like that when you think them and let positive thoughts flow.  This is also why dependence is painful.

If your belief is ""I don't need girls"" but you're getting depressed when you get rejected, or you say sex isn't necessary but you're scrolling through pornhub edging, you're fucking yourself up. You're saying one thing, but doing another. And actions speak louder then words, so watch this carefully. 

- Don't edge. Period.
Like the earlier weed analogy, edging is dissonance. And you will go too far. Because eventually edging won't feel good either, and you'll want to finish. As animals, we often go into sexual hazes when we get horny. Nothing snaps you out of this later then thinking about where this behavior will leave you. When you finish, you will feel bad and regret the 2 seconds pleasure. I promise you that. It's only when you look down and see you're covered in your semen that the true shame sets in and you regret your actions. It's playing Russian roulette. Every time you play you have a chance of losing everything you've worked hard for.

-Cold Showers.
I'm not going to tell you your testosterone increases. But it kills urges really hard. And it makes you feel more awake. Good for morning rituals.

-Change your life.
NoFap is energy. Lots of it. Use it to change your life. Learn a new hobby, pick up a new skill, work harder at your job, work out, get better grades. Make a constructive use of your time.  Clearly, you're here for a reason. You don't like where you are now, probably. You will stay there until you choose to move. Either you whine or you climb. And the ladder is in front of you.

- Stop complaining.

Complaining is the least constructive thing in the world. Not quite destructive, but almost as bad. Complaining is the act of not solving a problem, but whining about it. Wasting valuable time you could have used to solve it, and poisoning your mental state. It's unnecessary and destructive, so don't do it.  How do you stop this?

- Be optimistic. 
Look to the bright side of everything. Smile more. Be happy. It's been proven that if you smile, even if it's fake, it makes you feel better. You feel happy. If negative thoughts come up, eliminate them and replace them with positive thoughts. Traffic Jam? Chance to relax and listen to good music. If you know you're fucked or that you're going to be in trouble no matter what, who cares anymore? What use is there getting upset when there's nothing you can do to change it? Stop worrying. It's on par with complaining in terms of uselessness. Let positivity flow. Become that guy who sees the bright side to everything.

- Fake it til you make it.
The thing with confidence is that it's in a lot of ways a state of being. If you think that you are great and successful, it will start to take root in your mind and actions. It's how affirmations work.  A mental state of confidence will make your actions confident. 

- Filters.
K9, RES, all that good stuff. Make the challenge as easy as you can make it. Why go through unnecessary hardship when you can just make it easier on yourself? It goes without saying then that you also need to stop

- Watching Porn.
Self explanatory. Dissonance.

- Get Active.

Make something of your life. Get the fuck off your computer and out of your comfort zone. Just go outside and do shit. As they say, ""Everyone's just making it up as they go along just like you."". So go enjoy life. Do crazy shit. Fuck what people think of you. All that matters is what you think of yourself.

And finally, 

- Believe in yourself.

Believe you can do it. Make your thoughts congruent with your actions. Take it one day at a time. The journey of a 1000 miles begins with a single step. You do not sprint a marathon. So stop trying to take 90 days as 3 months. Think of it as 90 24 hour segments. Deal with each day at a time. If you look up Mount Everest from the bottom, of course it seems impossible. Just climb. Don't look down, don't look up, just climb. When you're at the top, you have permission to look down.

Stay strong fapstronauts. Those are my tips to success. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to start climbing. I haven't climbed in a long time.

Do this thing, now.  Don't keep putting it off, telling yourself that you're just enjoying life, that you're young, that this is what normal young men do, that everyone does that, that all your buddies are sitting at home doing it and still having normal lives.  It's not true.  What we're doing is abnormal, it's hurting us, and you're NOT going to have a normal, happy life if you keep it up.

I remember countless times that I've thought to myself, ""Shit, I'd be perfectly content to just go through the rest of my life single, fapping a couple times a day, having online relationships, getting off to porn, etc.""  Bullshit.  That's not a life.  And if you're 18, or 22, or 25, and you keep doing this, you're going to reach a point in your life where you realize that you've wasted so much time, so much life, that you're never going to get back.  Right now in your life is probably the point at which you (should) have maximum creativity and energy and drive and freedom - you can choose whatever path you want for your life right now, and it's probably not too late to go down that path.  You can date who you want, love who you want, find a job you want, pursue hobbies you want, whatever.  And you're going to sit around jerking yourself in front of a computer for hours at a time 'til it hurts to touch yourself and you can barely make eye contact with your friends and family?  F that.  Don't do it.  Fix it, now.

You might not get superpowers, you might not become a chick magnet, you might not get a dream job somewhere, but so what?  99% of people on this earth don't have it as good as we do, just by virtue of living in a first-world country with all the pleasures and opportunities that entails.  Take advantage.  You don't need superpowers or to date models or to become a professional video-game designer.  Just have a good life.  That's what this is all about.  To have a normal, good, life.  We're throwing it all away, right now, every time we sit down and whip it out.  Stop, today.  Stop wasting your life.  Life is so good, we don't need this fake pleasure, this fake life, fake happiness, fake women.  There's so much real goodness out there.  Start enjoying it.  Please.

Sorry, got carried away.

It sounds terrible, but I think that's how I subconsciously felt; if a man put enough effort into treating a woman, she would owe sex in return. Instead love is a two-way street, given as gifts from both sides. If I gift my love to a girl and she gives me nothing in return, there is nothing wrong with that. She doesn't owe me her love.

1343617840.0,789,self.NoFap,xdf5s,I went to my 10-year high school reunion last night...,TheNumberX,943,154,131,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xdf5s/i_went_to_my_10year_high_school_reunion_last_night/,"It amazed me how little people change who they are deep down, and it was fascinating to see how our choices define and refine who we become.

I was then, am now, and probably always will be an eccentric loner. But as I've spent the past year focusing on my personal development, I am starting to see things differently. Just because I enjoy spending time alone does not mean that I have to continue to be afraid of taking initiative when it comes to going after what I want.


Over dinner, I casually chatted with a small group of my classmates. One of them was a woman I had a crush on in the sixth grade. Back then, she was cute and smart...I crushed on her for a few months before becoming infatuated with a 'hot' girl. I never asked either out, because even back then engaging women was terrifying for me. Though, like most adolescent boys, I did have quite a few shamefully awkward encounters with the hot one.

Fast forward to yesterday, and my conversation with the girl that was cute and smart. Now, she is an educated, charming, and beautiful woman. I didn't feel intimidated, though...I felt allured.

She told me she spends her time between two cities--one of which I live in. She seemed to be interested and engaged when I was talking about my life, and she laughed at my offbeat witticisms.


Later, I told my friend I wanted to ask her out. He agreed it was a good idea. I couldn't do it, though. She was standing in a conversation-circle between two demons from my past: A guy who used to bully me and the aforementioned 'hot' girl I awkwardly lusted after all through high school. I thought 'oh, maybe I'll just find her on Facebook and send her a message...' I knew that's not what the ideal me would do, and I wondered what kind of impression that would give compared to directly asking her out. But I was just too scared. Those people used to have so much power over me, and apparently they still did.

After a while, my friend asked if I wanted to leave; I said yes, and he said 'are you sure? You won't get another chance, and chances are you'll never see any of these people again.' Didn't matter--I had already succumbed to my fear. I had resigned myself to being a coward by refusing to directly approach what I want.

We were walking around the corner, and it struck me...I might not be able to change who I am, but I don't have to let fear rule my actions. I spun around, walked up to her, and asked her out to a beer. Right in front of the guy that used to bully me. Right in front of the hot girl who wanted nothing to do with me in high school. I have **never** asked anyone out that directly, much less in a situation like this...she seemed surprised for a moment, and then enthusiastically agreed to meet up.

The hot girl watched me as I walked by; I smugly said hello and goodbye to her in the same sentence. I could almost taste her incredulity.


Joseph Campbell said that a man must slay the monsters of his nursery before he can begin his heroic journey. I don't care if the woman I asked out never actually goes out with me--the fact that I spat in the face of everything I used to be scared of made the whole night worthwhile. It showed me that even though I am fundamentally the same person, I can choose to act in spite of my limitations.

For the record, NoFap isn't responsible for this progress. I am.

I didn't ask her out because I stopped fapping. I asked her out, because I wanted to, and have challenged and pushed myself to the point that fear is becoming less of a motivator.

The constant influx of new bodies, new kinks, new faces and breasts and buttocks flashing on screens in an unending search for perfection and an ever-hotter sex object freaks me out beyond belief. I know what a guy does in his alone time isn't my business, but in the end what scares me is this: **I can't compete with that.**

I'm human. I'm one person. I can't be edited or cropped or only shown at my best angle. I have stubble and creases and blemishes and veins, I'm not tanned and oiled and lubed up and prancing around in a thong all day. What I'm finding is that the young men I'm with, even the ones who claim I'm the most beautiful creature they've ever seen (and they do) aren't aroused by just me. I could get completely naked, sit on his lap, put my real hands on him and kiss him with real lips, and I'm still second best. I can't be opened in five tabs as a brunette and a redhead and with huge boobs and small ones and thinner and curvier and the rest. I'm stagnant, stationary, one being. And somehow that's not sexy.

Women NEED NoFappers. We need to be sexy again. We need a guy who can look at his girlfriend, his fiancee, his wife, and find her attractive. I'm looking for that, and I hope I find it, because in the end, I can't settle for less. I can't waste my time trying to fix myself and deal with rejection and disappointment because he couldn't stay away from a hundred other, new, sexier girls. It's too heartbreaking.

So thank you, each and every one of you, for doing what you're doing (or not doing, I should say). You're getting back to normal, you're standing up and saying to the world ""Sex should be sexy! Men should want their women more than their computers!"" You're giving me hope that I'm good enough, that it's okay for me to be who I am, and that I can have a normal and fulfilling sex life. 

If you're ever feeling weak, or considering going back to the cycle of bingeing and craving and self-loathing, stay strong for us girls. You're the Prince Charmings of the 21st century, because if he could have stayed home and pulled up ""princessxxx.com"" she'd still be locked in that tower.

I've pretty much obsessed over this line the past few days, they hit me deep in the heart. People have addictions; meth, cocaine, tobacco, alcohol, PMO, mindless facebooking, browsing the internet, casual redditing and what not, all basically have the same underlying cause: an attempt to escape reality (with or without a dopamine fix)

You may choose fapping as a form to forget tomorrows test or you may crack up weed or just waste time liking stupid photos on Reddit. You have created your nest, where you come everyday and get your high, feel home. It might not even be so much pleasure, but you feel relieved. Relieved of the pain you don't have to feel now that you're in your nest. You love the nest, it makes you feel comfy. It keeps you sane, you'd go insane if you didn't have this. When you don't get the nest for two days, you are fucking sick! This nest is the prison you are in fapstronaut, what you've created for yourself. YOU ARE LIVING YOUR LIFE IN A TRACE, WAKE UP. This is whats stopping you from getting the superpowers, fapstronaut.

Things were not always like this. When you were a kid, you had dreams and unlimited energy. You didn't feel like not getting off the couch. You were superman. You were never in the hungover state of mental fog, you had clarity and focus. You were superman. You never thought things were impossible, you were not so fearful. You were superman. When you really did study for the test due next week. Things got awry somewhere down the line, maybe it sparked as a solution once when you discovered that fapping before the test relieves you of the stress and tension. You started playing video games to keep yourself distracted from the thought that you were wasting your time, and went further down the spiral. You did that again, and again, and again and soon you had created a nest, your prison, somewhere down the line, you started loving the prison. The prison turned down the volume for you, the volume of pain, stress, anxiety, boredom. Your prison was PMO.

I'm 18 guys, I don't have much of an addiction as many guys here have, but reading through my journal and understanding what triggers me to waste time, be unproductive; for fapping or any other mindless activity are generally the same. A feeling of wanting to get back to the nest. When I'm stressed, when I want to escape.

I have a very happy life, I have a fucking-awesome-girlfriend who I really love and I have goals for myself, my family and my love. Somewhere down the line, I lost focus. I lost focus when a big goal I'd chosen for myself became too overwhelming to accomplish. I created my nest then. In a remarkable turn of events, I have the same goal again. Life gave me another chance to conquer my fear, although it's seemingly impossible to accomplish it under the time I've been given, this time I won't stop myself short. I'll give my best till the last second. I'll live my life and I'll get out of the prison. 

NoFap is not a magic bullet that will solve all your life's problems. But getting out of your prison would. You have to stop being a bitch and face stuff, face the problems you have. You have to proactively get out of out comfort zone to leave the prison, you have to be the fucking man in your life and regain control. When you don't feel like doing the things you should be doing, that is exactly when you should do them. This is your life fapstronaut, don't let you dick, your brain, or your emotions control your life! Everytime you force yourself out of the prison, you wake up a part of yourself. You wake up the superman in you. People who get out of fapping and who also get out of their prisons, get the superpowers. The superpowers are lying dormant in you, waiting for you, waiting for you to wake up and fucking use them, cause they were made for you. Go achieve all those dreams you've dreamed for yourself and get the confidence you always wanted. Want to feel alive? Leave the fucking couch and see the superpower being enabled. You were Superman. You could be Superman again. Get the fuck off reddit and do something with your life that you didn't originally have time for.

I have never posted anything on any website before but I really would like to say something now. Hopefully it won't sound like just some guy who wants to post his amazing insights that everyone has heard a thousand times before. 
I am 58 years old. A lot of the posters on this subject seem to be much younger than me. High school kids. College kids. I am amazed at some of the ideas and insights they come with when it comes to giving up fapping and porn and how important it is. It inspires me greatly. 
Now don't get me wrong. I'm a middle class guy living a middle class life. Married, two kids, 17 and 21 years old. I haven't failed by any stretch of the imagination. 
But I am haunted by all of the things I could have done. If I had had more interest in life and more ambition, and more focus. For so many years, when I was alone and could have spent the time doing something that would lead me to a more satisfying and in my mind more productive life, more likely than not I spent the time fantasizing and fapping accompanied by its subsequent hangover. 
If I had been smarter I would have gotten help, but I grew up thinking that I was smart enough and a man enough to be able to fix his own problems. When you grow up thinking you should be able to do everything yourself and it doesn't work, it leads to a hiding life. Fapping and porn are custom built for a hiding life.  
You feel as if everyone else is doing the right thing and living a proper life while you sit in a dark room going from image to image in search of the perfect one, fapping again and again thinking this one will be the last. 
You live in absolute fear of being found out for what you are. You can't look people in the eye because you just know that they'll be able to tell what a complete jack off you are.  
When you're alone though, for those few minutes at least you're King of the World. But then you have to wipe the cum off your stomach and suffer more hours of lethargy and hiding. 
Somehow you make through the days at work. You're presentable. You can get the minimum amount of work done so that people will think you're okay. But you lack drive. You lack ambition. Other people will come in and move up quickly, but you don't really want to. 
Years go by and you don't realize it but time is running out. I've had friends who have lived and died in less time than I have spent fantasizing my life away. 
Any venturing out of your shell and you find yourself running back to the safety of your dark room and your computer screen. Any stressful situation and you find yourself clamoring back to your computer screen. 
But the thing is, as you live this hiding kind of life, every situation becomes stressful. Normal conversations with people you meet become stressful. Every bill in the mail becomes stressful. Every crowded place becomes stressful. You just want to be left alone to lock yourself in your room and find the perfect woman who can't help herself from begging you to have the most incredible sex with her because she can see how unbelievably desireable you are. But then you feel sick all over again when you have to wipe the jizz off your stomach and you've wasted another pathetic day. 
But how did you get like this? Is it your fault? Can you really do anything about it? 
The fact is, it probably isn't your fault that this became your life. It happened before you realized what was going on. 
We are surrounded from the minute we get up in the morning until we go to bed way too late by an incredible amount of stimulation. Fast pulsing music, everywhere someone is telling us what we need to have, pictures of beautiful people living the most incredible lives that we should be living too. We're shown all of the things that other people have and if we don't get it too we'll never be as cool as they are. Tell me that isn't stressful.
Our entire exsistence is marketed to us 24 hours a day, and most of it is tied somehow to sex, because sex sells. Evan if you don't see the sex, it's there underneath somewhere. 
Fot thousands of years, humans lived the majority of their lives more quietly, with their own thoughts, punctuated occassionally by brief moments of intense stimulation. Whether you were running from some wild animal hoping not to get eaten or having sex with one of the few partners available to you, for the most part you lived day to day slower and with very little stimulation. That is how humans evolved
Now we are bombarded 24 hours a day, mostly by sex, and we are not built for it. Endless women at our fingertips just begging for our cum.  
It has made us, at least those of us who are spending their lives wiping jizz off their stomachs, in to drug addicts. Our brains have become addicted to the dopamine rush it gets from the intense stimulation of the pixels that desire us like crazy. 
We are no different from the heroin addicts who steal whatever they can get their hands on to feed their addiction. We are no different from the crack addict who gets his fix and lays on the couch while his eyes roll back in his head as he avoids life and the real world. Only we steal time. We steal from the future. 
We look at heroin addicts and feel sorry for them. We abhor the fact that they waste their one opportunity at life and become a living shell of a human being, on their way to an early death. 
Maybe our addiction isn't so obvious. Maybe it isn't quite as lethal, at least in the same way. But it is deadly in other ways. It deadens us to the world around us. It deadens us to the present. It deadens us to the future. Years, years can go by as you wipe your load off of your stomach and look at yourself in the mirror wondering what is wrong with you. Years out of the one and only life you will every have.
But, and this is huge, it can change. 
There is nothing wrong with you. You're not immoral, you're not a pervert, you're not the disgusting individual you think you are. You're a drug addict, plain and simple.
Your brain that is addicted to dopamine can be weaned off of it. It isn't easy, I still struggle, but you can change your brain. The neural pathways that are so worn down from the traffic of porn and fap and hiding and shame can, if unused, become overgrown and impassable. 
New paths can be made, and from constant use become just as worn and easy to walk as the old pathways. These paths can be whatever it is you love in life. Exercise. Writing. Learning. Reading. Helping others. Working. Anything you really enjoy and that you feel makes your life better and what you want it to be. 
So take it one day at a time. Live good 5 minute periods, or hour long periods, or 24 hour periods. Make it a 30 day challenge or a 60 day challenge or whatever works for you. 
As I've read before, good minutes add up to good hours, good hours add up to good days, good days add up to good weeks, and so on. 
Live open. Live clean. Share. Get help wherever you can. Find like minded individuals. Use whatever you can find as motivation. Turn off your fucking computer. Quiet down your life and think about what you want and not what others tell you to want. Screw them. They've sucked enough life out of you. Do what you want to do now. 
The only person in your way is yourself. You can change and do whatever you want. 
Sorry about the long post. I don't mean to preach because I struggle and don't have all of the answers. What I think I have is an outlook from someone who is older and if I can share that with the guys on this site who are younger and it gives them more insight about what the effects could be if they spend too much of their lives looking in the mirror wondering what is wrong with them, then maybe someone will waste less time of their precious life. 
It is given with honesty and a hope that it will be a beneficial perspective to those that are young enough and have many years ahead to do great things in this world. ",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,month3,True,t3_1elfxn,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1elfxn/advice_to_the_younger_guys/,
1361963565.0,768,self.NoFap,19bl70,25 Reasons to do NoFap,brokenfap,965,197,269,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/19bl70/25_reasons_to_do_nofap/,"1.	Spend lots of time engaging in other productive activities that will turn you into a much more qualified person.


2.	Quit objectifying women, start seeing them as human beings.


3.	Much higher confidence, trust and pride in self.


4.	Be a free man who wanders at will. No more a desperate slave with no control over self-fate.


5.	Start feeling these intense emotions all the time, instead of being numbed to the beautiful world around you. No more the walking dead.


6.	Much less procrastinating. Get things done on time, resulting in much higher success at work or in school.


7.	No more scared to let other people use your computer, no more fears of being caught.


8.	Burst with newfound energy. *Run Forrest Run*.


9.	Start - possibly for the first time since puberty - to *really* love yourself for who you are. The self that you always loved but unfortunately kept locked away in a self-built prison in your body, now has the opportunity to break free and come out. Grow that child into a man. You will find peace of mind in him.


10.	Much less depression. You’ll keep finding yourself feeling happy and positive for no apparent reasons, at the same situations where you used to feel worried and distressed before. This is because no matter what, you know you have given your best.


11.	Regain that long lost ability of actually falling truely, madly, deeply in love with someone. Caution! Get ready to shed some tears, because you may end up desperately thinking about that one SO, instead of getting hypnotized stupid by all that fabricated and useless, zombified novelty in porn.


12.	Grow the ability to maintain a healthy long-term relationship where you can actually be trustworthy, dependable and reliable and can deserve to receive the same treatment in return.


13.	THE ED. Inevitably caused by the PMO addiction. Need I say more? NEED I SAY MORE?


14.	After a long enough streak, you will see that people around you will start caring more about you. The reason for this is that, before NoFap, one half of you was completely missing from their sight.  That one half was busy wasting himself away in a life of secrecy built on shame. He was not present. That half of you did not exist in the real world. And the other half that did exist in the real world was constantly insecure and double minded in his attitude, never being able to give his best because of the PMO addiction. Now people will start to care more about you because you will be at least twice more present in their lives. And when I say present, I mean PRESENT. INFLUENTIAL. IMPRESSIVE. 


15.	Increased overall physical health, because you are keeping your sperm in your body. Read about it.


16.	You can add to that health by actively working out too you know, which you probably will, because NoFap is much harder without hitting the gym anyway. Get. In. Shape!


17.	Master your knowledge on how the plastic structure of your brain impacts your behavior. This new modern insight into **neuroplasticity** is an eventual and positive side effect of doing NoFap through YBOP and will have its positive impact on **every** aspect of your life depending on what you do with it. 


18.	Be much more creative than before. You are forcing your brain to leave its biggest comfort zone. That means it has to come up with new neuron pathways to survive. Those new pathways mean new ideas. New ideas mean better creativity in whatever you are keeping your brain busy with. Innovate your life.


19.	An immense increase in willpower. One badass lion of willpower. How hard could *anything* be, compared to quitting PMO? No match ever. No barriers could stand a chance against you.


20.	*Attention Magnetism*. If you’re doing it right, you will inevitably be radiating all this positive energy wherever you go and everyone - especially ladies - will be noticing you out of nowhere. They will look at you, they will want to talk to you. It’s serious and works like a charm, but when you come to think of it, it's nothing magical really: Nature runs its course when you run yours.


21.	Piece of cake to initiate dialogues, especially after a certain point. You don’t even have to think about it. Much less self-consciousness.


22.	No more of that creepy feeling of two personalities one of which you always have to hide and makes you feel like you'd almost rather commit suicide than found out. Honest with self, honest with all. You are one and whole and complete. 


23.	No, you are never complete and will never be. Always room for development, since you have the time and the energy it takes to improve yourself in any aspect.


24.	Get rid of other bad habits as well. NoFap initiates the good domino effect for your life.


25.	Be 1 in a 1,000,000. Really.


In contrast;

1 reason to do PMO:

1. Numb yourself so that you can maintain a vegetably satisfied life instead of achieving all these real traits, unlike a human but like a zombie, where, in the long run, the lack of all these traits is inevitably going to take its toll on you, quiet terribly I assure you.


Now, is there even a match here? I don't want that. You know PMO is something VERY idiotic when it has the mystical power to turn off your conscious and make you blindly ignore ALL THESE VERY CRUCIAL REASONS. PMO is THAT stupid, if you know what I mean. So if there was one single medicine that would give me all those benefits above, I'd pay all I ever had to buy that. Apparently there is none, but there is NoFap. I will give all I have to do NoFap and to run from PMO, because I know I have to and there is no other way around my life.

Best regards and best wishes to all Fapstronauts!

It's cold. It's miserable. Everything about you screams to get back in the water so you can be warm again. So you do, realizing that you still have to get out eventually and suffer the inconvenience again.

But if you stay out of the water, eventually you fight through the cold and the discomfort and dry off. It takes a while, but you feel better. You no longer feel the need to jump in the water to feel warm.

That's what I feel it's comparable to. The urge of getting back in so you're not uncomfortable anymore... And this is all assuming you didn't just bring a towel with you to the lake...

I was never able to finish during sex. Ever. I death gripped my penis so much that it was completely numb. I felt NOTHING during sex. I had to fantasize about porn just to keep an erection. My girlfriend thought that it was her fault. Our sex life was terrible and our relationship was going downhill. I had masturbate for 30 minutes after sex just to orgasm. It was pathetic and embarrassing.

When my girlfriend left on vacation for a 20 days, I knew that I had to make a change. And I did. It was really fucking hard. I even sold my computer just to get rid of temptations, that's how serious I was about fixing this. And I managed to make it to 20 days. No porn, no edging.

Yesterday, my girlfriend came home. I didn't know if NoFap would help me, I was nervous. Because if it didn't work, then I would have to masturbate to finish and I would spiral back in to deathgripping. And guess what... I fucking finished. Inside of her. For the first fucking time. Within 20 minutes too. I was so happy I started laughing. NoFap is amazing. Fuck porn. Fuck jacking off. It's time to stop. I will never EVER go back to porn.

I took off of work yesterday so that I could buy gifts for my three year anniversary. My wife is aware of my ""habits"", but she doesn't mention it.

I didn't buy any gifts yesterday. I woke up, masturbated, played some video games, masturbated... so on and so forth. I probably masturbated 7 times yesterday. In fact, I did so little yesterday that I couldn't even go to sleep last night/this morning because I was basically at rest for the entire day. So, at 3 AM, I decide to give up on sleeping and practice some self love. This decision was very natural for me.

I have no idea how I ended up on this subreddit. I hate you guys because now that I know that *this is a thing*, and that I'm *not alone*... shit, man. I have to get my act together.
So here goes, here's the spiel. let me get this off of my chest... you guys probably won't read this anyway, but if anybody understands it's you guys.

Jerking off is ruining my marriage. I'm 23 years old, my wife is 22, and we have sex maybe once every **two months**. I can't even begin to imagine how she feels about my masturbating then constantly turning her down for sex.

I have no energy. I work from ~7 until 4:30, come home and masturbate a time or two until my wife comes home at 6:15, then sit around doing nothing or take a nap. I'll wake up for long enough to eat a late dinner, then I'll go to bed for the night. I want to *do things*.


I can't begin to count the times I've decided to learn something via the Internet (database design, network security, programming) and decided to masturbate instead.



I'm starting today. I've been doing this for 13 years... this is going to be one hell of a habit to break.

Note: This is an initiative from a fellow fapstronaut, and not an ""official"" survey from the nofap subreddit moderation/management team. Just so you know. :)

Update: Added a question about relationship status. The alternatives might be (very) vague, but choose what fits you the most. Since there has been a couple of addenda to the survey, the report will probably state the number of respondents for each question.


New update:

One word: Woah!

Massive response, loving it! Give me a little under a week and you'll all have your results. Going on a study trip for a couple of days now, going to take down the survey and start making you some sweet pie charts and columns and shit as soon as I get the time on my hands.

Also, lots of great feedback on the survey itself here. Everything is duly noted and will be taken into consideration if I decide to make another one. As many has pointed out, the scale questions might be a bit/very skewed as they are inversed left/right if you compare to what's normal.

This was my very first survey ever, and I believe very few survey-makers has been able to gather this much data on such a short period of time, at least not their first time. Great stuff, guys and gals!

The response has been overwhelming both here and in the survey (&gt;2300 informants now). I don't have the capacity (or necessarily even the knowledge) to respond to all of the questions and comments in this thread, but I will highlight anything that might be a source of bad data as soon as the report is ready for presentation.

Lewis, and it completely blew my mind. I wouldn't be surprised if this is old news for many of you... but for the newbies (including myself), I felt it would be worthwhile to repeat...*


""For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself…After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison."" -C.S.

You will stop masturbating, and that will force you to grow the courage to ask girls out. And one day you will find one who you can start having sex with every day instead of watching porn and masturbating every day. 

I used to think this way. I'd never put it so bluntly to myself. And I thought, well that's a perfectly healthy way to want to live your life. It's just one girl. And it's not like you aren't doing other activities with her. 

This is not how marriage works. This is not how strong, healthy premarital relationships work. And if it's what you want, maybe you're not so bad off masturbating. 

And I do not mean that last sentence as an insult, or to suggest that you are unworthy or something. You're just not going to find a girl like that where you can have sex indefinitely and it remain fresh, satisfying and exciting. 

But I do think you need to change your thinking. 

Instead of trying to stop masturbating all of the time so that you can get real sex all the time. Maybe try to just stop wanting sex all the time. 

Learn to appreciate other aspects of your life, of yourself.

Now that you aren't addicted to jerking off. You had no urge to be finished with the exercise. You thought of nothing else but your relationship to the guitar. You were a ROCK GOD!

And it needs to be this way throughout the rest of your life. 

Do not value yourself based on how many girls you're getting, or the rating of your girl friend, or if you are getting laid. There are other things to pursue. 

You have work to do right now. You can't be bothered to make love to your girl friend every single fucking night, baby, we just did it two evenings ago.

An hour later we're having the best sex we've had yet (been sleeping together for about 8 months now), and it's only been getting better throughout my nofap journey.

I'd like to think that a month ago I would have been in my room cleaning up a fap session when the phone rings and to my horror hear ""I'm 45 minutes away"".

1341577782.0,525,self.NoFap,w4jq2,"Okay newbie guys, this is what it takes: listen up, man up and quit screwin' up",LactoseGalaxy,658,133,193,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/w4jq2/okay_newbie_guys_this_is_what_it_takes_listen_up/,"Maybe you just discovered noFap or maybe you're a '1Week' guy who feels stuck in a cycle of never getting past the first week. Jot this stuff down:

1. It doesn't take a superpower. If you're telling yourself that the 90day guys have something you don't have, you're lying to yourself. We all have sexual impulses, we all have rather animated dicks and we're all attracted to the fake, plastic sex-impersonation known as porn. We're all human.

2. Stop teasing yourself. There's no way you can browse porn galleries 'just to look'. Porn always walks hand-in-gooey-hand with masturbation. If you do one, you'll do the other. Stop edging too. Countless threads attest to this. ""Just a little stroke,"" whines your penis. Tell it to clam up. And then do pushups. 

3. While on the topic: yeah, pushups. How much do you exercise? If you mean to stop fapping, get ready for an energy boost. Because you aren't pathetically squeezing your life juice out of your feeble dick, your body is going to build up healthy levels of energy. That's a good thing. Now what are you gonna do about it? Channel that energy into the gym, into jogging, or just plan 'ole pushups. Start up a hobby, learn a craft, go walking, etc. Just get busy. Being a couch potato does not encourage you onward. 

4. Realize that you may be simultaneously facing an internet addiction. I mention this because I experienced it. I would stay up late at night browsing the web ... pointless idle time. And take a wild guess what happened when boredom really set in? Porn. If you cut back on your online time, you're only helping yourself.

5. Determined guys take drastic measures. There's no shame in that. How badly do you want to be free of this mad cycle of PMO? What would you give to *get out*? Some guys insist on taking their iPads to bed to 'browse the net' but then - lo and behold - start browsing porn. Yikes, how did that happen? It happened when you gave yourself the delicacy of being so close &amp; alone with an internet connection you can almost envision the porn. If your trip-ups are being caused by a laptop in your room or a tablet in your hand, choose to leave both in another room. Get someone to change the wi-fi password if you must. 

6. Focus on today. Don't worry about the other days left to complete the 90day milestone. You are always on DAY ONE because you should only focus on ONE DAY per day. Take it in 24 hour bits. Choose today to end the day being PMO free. Tomorrow choose to make the same choices you made today.

7. It requires a lifestyle change and will - most awesomely - *result* in a lifestyle change. Turning your back on PMO requires you to make certain changes that others might call 'dramatic'. Just call them 'necessary' and nothing more. Don't run from it, because the outcome is pretty good: I've noticed better self-discipline in other areas of my life as well. Being free from a vicious vice of PMO has affected other areas of my lifestyle: work, school and relationships. 

8. Like everything else in this world, we require consistent maintenance. The impulses and urges don't disappear. You gotta stay alert no matter if you're just beginning, in the middle or beyond the end. Stay smart. Don't get sloppy with your dick. 

9. If you mess up, don't give up. Pick yourself up, tell yourself out loud how deceivingly disappointing porn is, and move on. After all....see point #1. 

10. The **real** thing is *multipliably* times better than the plastic porn thing. To have someone's arms around you, desiring you, loving you, wanting to give all she is to you, in all her faults accepting all of yours, tenderly &amp; warmly kissing you, cuddling you, touching you with that feminine softness, whispering, laughing, smiling, a shining in her eyes and a shiver in her spine... She looks straight into your face as you honestly realize that you want her beyond a moment's orgasm. You desire her for more than just a cum session. More than what your dick always asks for. You want her for who she is, for what she is, and the beautiful person you've come to adore. There isn't a porn star in the world who can make you feel this warm contentedness in realizing that you value her as a whole, and not just a hole to stick your dick into. PMO deadens your senses, beginning with those in your brain and ending with those in your dick. In contrast, as John Denver so eloquently put it, real, warm, living lovemaking *fills up your senses* like a night in a forest, like the mountains in springtime... 

We're in this together guys. Other guys have done it, I've done it and you're next up to bat: you can beat this. Stop using the artificial crutch of porn to *feel* like a man. Time to *be* a man. 

Let's do this.

Last night, I was sitting around post-workout relaxing, busy not fapping (you know how that goes) and of course I was thinking about sex. Then it hit me: I really enjoy thinking about beautiful women. I mean it makes me HAPPY. Being horny was enjoyable and life-affirming last night because for the first time in my life I didn't see it as a problem that needed to be fixed. I realized that it's my natural state as a man and it's essential to being a true man.

Think about it: if you're caught in the daily PMO cycle, you see your sex drive as a problem in constant need of fixing. We're in a sense afraid of being horny because whenever we start feeling that longing we immediately start yanking ourselves until it goes away. WHY? Last night I found out that if you don't rush to put that fire out, it turns out that that fire is the very fire that should be constantly burning in all men, pushing us forth into the world to conquer and win.

I feel confident. I feel like I’ve got a game plan when it comes to meeting women. I’ve got dates lined up and I’m building toward something. 

Those aren’t the days I feel like masturbating.

It’s the bad ones. 

I went out on a bad date. Or didn’t hook up with a girl on New Years after she made out with me for an hour. Or I see a smoking hot girl in black tights and I’m overwhelmed by how much I want her. Things aren’t happening in my romantic life like I want. That’s when I want to masturbate. 

It's 6 pm on Sunday evening. I’m coming home in a cab. I'm a few blocks from my apartment. Alone. Horny. Feelin down. I’m too tired to go out. I just want to go home and relax. Watch a movie. And masturbate. 

I know what masturbation is. It’s a signal to myself that I’ve hit bottom. That I may as well gratify myself, because no one else will be doing it for a long time. 

But as I walk through the hallway of my apartment building, something snaps into place. 

This day is not my life. I’m better than this. This moment doesn’t define who I am. I will withhold.

There’s nothing valiant about withholding. The Rocky theme song is not playing in the background for something I *didn’t* do (masturbate). I won’t transform into a power extrovert or avert depression and anxiety—at least not tonight. There’s nothing tragically artistic about puritanism. No woman ever loved a man for his virtue.

But I have one thing. My body. And by not masturbating, I’m communicating with my body and my mind. In this simple withholding of self-gratification is a message. It says:

I don't know what it was, but I honestly don't think anything like this would have happened before nofap.  Maybe it was my confidence shining through or the fact that when I have engaged her in casual conversation I've been able to make strong eye contact and speak easily.  Whatever it was, it sure made me feel good.  

Small victory today guys, but worth feeling good about.

Edit2: Just talked to her in the parking lot after work.  Seems to be really cool.  I told her I thought it was pretty cool that she had the courage to walk right in my office and ask me out.  Then I suggested that lunch might be a little impersonal and that she should give me her number to grab drinks one night.  She didn't hesitate at all and was very flirty throughout.

Specifically, shit like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1ewr3c/stop_putting_the_pussy_on_the_pedestal/).

Fuck you.  It's up to every person on here to decide their own goals and why they are undertaking this challenge.  As a 20 year old virgin, you can be damn sure my top goal is to get laid and have a gf.  It might even be my only goal, no real ED or addiction problems here.

Let me be clear.  There's nothing wrong with advising beginners that NoFap is only a conduit to other life changes, and does not change behaviour in and of itself.  That's the truth.  But posts like the above (and there have been several like it) outright dismiss MY reason for doing this, saying it's not an ""actual goal"".  If people want to turn this into some kind of all-encompassing spiritual growth exercise, that's their prerogative, but don't get mad when others only have one simplistic goal.

Seeing as that post is at the top of this sub at the moment, I realize this may be an unpopular opinion, but it needs to be said.  This place is for support and sharing experiences, NOT projecting yourself onto others and dictating which goals are and aren't worthwhile.

Peace.

And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no real woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover: no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity.

The whole point of this, whether you realize it or not, is not to get girls.  It's to realize that while sex and sexual pleasure is nice,  it should not come first on your list of priorities.  

Focus on learning, making your life better, and ~~actual~~ long-term goals.  

Having a mate won't make you happy if you aren't a whole person.


*EDIT:  There seems to be a lot of arguments, controversy, and misconceptions regarding this post.  

First, obviously the title is just a stupid way to break the proverbial ice.  A split second reactionary thought.  Using it as an ad hominem argument is useless.

Second, there are many things I want to say, but many of the comments in this post and others articulate far better than I am able to right now.  The post doesn't necessarily apply to you.  I'm not judging anyone for wanting sex.  I love sex.  (I love sexual pleasure a little too much, it seems.)  

Go out and get laid!  Do whatever you want.  I'm not judging.  I have been the person focussed solely on sex, and so have many others.  You can't have sex all the time, and you still need to have stuff going for you outside of that time in order to get something out of life.

I will just add a comment I made earlier, as it may be better than what my non-functioning brain is thinking of right now.

&gt;Listen, I may not be able to completely articulate my thoughts right now, but I want you to know, as I've said, there is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting to meet girls. There is nothing wrong with sex. Hell, imo there is nothing wrong with masturbation either.

&gt;That all being said, the point of my post was just to say, the difficulty meeting women/having meaningful relationships goes far beyond not masturbating. Learning the discipline, focus, and time management that enables you to improve your over all status, and well-being will greatly propel your chances of meeting a mate, among other things.

&gt;Becoming a person with goals that are independent of other people's feelings or approval is a big step that a lot of people struggle with. If you already have those, and are content with life other than your mate situation, that's completely fine; the post doesn't really apply to you.

&gt;I feel as though many people here, instead of trying to improve themselves, are merely trying to replace one addiction with another, very similar one.

&gt;Again, this doesn't apply to everyone. People don't need to be offended, they just have to be reasonable. Clearly it's an issue that resonates with a large amount of the subscribers of this subreddit, but it's not going to be for everyone.

I've tried quitting many times before, but I usually lasted 12 hours at most. Once or twice I've lasted past 24 hours, but then relapsed pretty quickly, and made up for lost time by fapping 3 times in quick succession. I don't even watch porn much. Maybe for one session every fortnight at most. For me, it's almost entirely my imagination. 

So three days ago, I saw a link to this subreddit somewhere. I had heard of it before, but I had always thought it couldn't do anything more to help me quit than I could do for myself. 

But anyway, I decided to give it a try, and what I read here changed me completely. I can't put a finger on exactly what it is, but somehow, reading all of your advice and stories is helping me immensely.

So anyway, it has now been more than 72 hours since I discovered this subreddit. And for those I have managed not to fap. A few times I have come close, about two hours ago I was practically begging myself to, but I just didn't let myself touch my dick, and it finally passed.

Even when i thought I was doing it because I wanted to, that was the addiction talking) and me now, with the addiction broken, is staggering. Stick with it, it's all I can say. You will feel like shit for a while, it might be right away, it might be after a few weeks, but that is just your body finally showing you the toll the addiction was taking. Cause when you finally get back to normal, then you realize how fucked up it all is.

Sorry if this is kinda disjointed, just my thoughts on it. I will admonish anyone who looks at porn though, cut that shit out at all costs. Even if you keep jerking off, cut the porn out. the ways it fucks with your head is unbelievable. it conditions you to think that porn is normal, that fucking with no emotional attachment is the standard. women aren't something you care about, they just become over-sexualized things that you don't desire as a person, but just to conquer. Every relationship you have ever had or will ever have is hurt by an addiction to porn, and if you use it long enough, you will be addicted. That's how it's designed, it's designed to get you addicted and needing a fix you will pay for and always seek.

Either way, this is the closing rant of a Reddit user who's been on for over 2 years. this site is a bit of a time waster and I have a wedding to plan and life to go do. Stay with it, never stop fighting. Reclaim your life. And go outside and do something, It seriously helps.

A silly idea is current that good people do not know what temptation means. This is an obvious lie. 

Only those who try to resist temptation know how strong it is. After all, you find out the strength of the German army by fighting it, not by giving in. You find out the strength of the wind by trying to talk against it, not by lying down. 

A man who gives into temptation after five minutes simply does not know what it would have been like an hour later. 

That is why bad people, in one sense, know very little about badness. They have lived a sheltered life by always giving in.

Once you relapse it’s so hard to get on a long streak again, your brain will rationalize *”one more time, then we’ll start over again – hey, what does it matter, you only got 3 days…”*

Had to reset again yesterday. Read something in this book I’m reading about neurology that changed everything. I suddenly realized NoFap is serious, dead serious. Check this out.

A scientist mapped the brain of a Silver Spring monkey. He did this by opening the brain up and stimulated the monkey’s thumb, then analyzed where in the brain neurons fired for the thumb. He did this for the pointer, middle finger and so on. His findings were remarkable at the time: he found that the neurons that fired when the thumb was stroked was right next to the neurons that fired for the index, which was next to the ones that fired for the middle finger and so on. They were aligned.

Next they sewed the index and middle finger together on the monkey (quite cruel actually) and waited for two months. Then they opened the brain up again. They stroked the thumb and saw the neurons fire at the same place as before. Now they stroked the index finger, which had been connected to the middle finger for two months, and they were amazed to find that the brain had reorganized itself, so that there where there used to be two separate neuron maps for the index- and middle-finger, there were now just one big map.

**Neurons that fire together wire together!** Some professional guitarists also experience this when they get something called focal dystonia when they can’t move two fingers separately, only as one unit. When neurons fire together they also wire together.

This means that if you watch porn, which more often than not have dominating, humiliating, degrading and violent themes - you not only experience sex and violence together – you rewire your brain and change the neuron structure each time so sex and violence wire together in your brain. No wonder a lot of NoFappers here testifies that they experience ED (which to be blunt is euphemism for impotence).

When we watch porn we not only experience it, we rewire our brain. Each time we watch porn we strengthen this connection. Each time we ejaculate dopamine is flushed into these connections, further wiring them together, acting as “glue” since pleasant experiences get wired more easily.

Getting hard when in a normal relationship with a girl will be just as impossible as for the monkey to use his fingers individually. If after *two months* the monkeys fingers had merged into one neuron map, what do you think *years and decades* of porn will do to your brain? Without the pornographic themes you won’t get hard. Fortunately you can unlearn these behaviors and change the neuron maps back, this is what NoFap does – we all have to realize this is dead serious.

The day before yesterday was the last time I ever watched porn.

Need to get this off my chest.,jedipaul9,521,72,252,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1jyjv5/the_closest_ive_come_to_relapse_in_a_while_need/,"Yesterday was my 21st birthday. Attention whoring aside it was probably one of the loneliest and depressing birthdays I've ever had. I had made plans two weeks ago to go to a particular bar in downtown San Francisco and invited only a handful of my closest friends. I'm not much of a drinker but I was certainly looking forward to the ceremonial purchase of my first legal beer. I was looking forward to a fun night out with friends, but as the day approached nearer it became very clear to me that of the dozen or so people I had invited only two seemed to show any remote interest in actually accompanying me, and one of them was too broke to go out.

A friend of mine, let's call her Sarah, expressed serious interest in going although she's been known to be disingenuous. She promised she would go and even asked if I might be able to give her a ride to SF from Berkeley (which is about 20 or minutes out of the way). Well I just so happen to be attending a 12-Step meeting in Berkeley that night and said that if she wanted to come I could probably pick her up and drop her off. 

When I got out of my meeting at around 8:30pm I called Sarah and despite only a few hours earlier expressing how excited she was she informed me that she had changed her mind because she was feeling ""sleep deprived"". At the time I didn't think anything of it and had even decided that I would go to this bar and have a good time regardless of who was there and who wasn't. I was, however, a bit irked with the excuse as between doing hard mode for over 2 months and just recently quitting a daily marijuana smoking habit I myself was extremely sleep deprived. I didn't mention this to anyone of course, but that thought began to weigh heavily on me as I drove into SF and subsequently began walking from where I parked the car to the bar.

I saw a small gathering a people smoking cigarettes at the entrance and suddenly the loneliness had all hit. Despite having had to pay toll to cross the bridge and enter the city I went back to my car and drove aimlessly for about 15 minutes before finally deciding to drive home. I stopped by the local Safeway and bought some frozen pizza and a six pack and went home to read a book and try not to let myself become too emotional. 

Unfortunately for me my mom was still awake, and while she had the best intentions in heart she's incredibly talented at making me feel like complete and total shit. I didn't want to talk to her, or anyone, about the events of that evening because I was too ashamed to admit that no one seemed to care enough to celebrate what I was hoping would be my big day. She reminded me that I had chose to go out with friends instead of celebrate with the family and that was the final straw. I broke down into panting sobs and tears  and literally had to beg her to leave me the hell alone. 

I was consumed with anger and loneliness and on top of that I had been sleeping an average of 3 hours a night for a little over a week due to marijuana withdrawal. I wanted to fap so bad. I wanted everything to just go away, the emotions I was feeling, I just wanted them to die. It was then that I realized I had never felt so lonely in my entire life. I had spent so much time running away from my fear of abandonment with drugs and PMO that now in my sober and celibate state I felt completely helpless. 

Somewhere in all of this a little voice in my head told me that this was a good thing. I said aloud to myself ""I would rather feel like complete and total shit than run away from my feelings"". And it was true. I spent the next half hour or so waiting for the feelings to pass. They never did. As I type this I still feel like the biggest piece of shit this cosmic asshole we call the universe had ever conceived. 

But I didn't fap. And to me that's what was important.

Anyhow, I guess the reason I decided to share this is because I think all of us have something bubbling beneath the surface that we have used PMO to run away from. It is okay to *feel*. In a lot of ways that is exactly what NoFap is helping me learn to do. In that moment when I decided to wait out the pain and live *life on life's terms* I learned something very important about myself.

Please forgive the rambling wall of text, but consider this a confession. Everything feels better after you confess. At least for me anyway. Your love and support is always appreciated. Stay strong fellow fapstronauts. I believe in you every bit as much as I believe in myself.

**tl;dr** Spent birthday alone. Had emotional breakdown. Didn't fap.

I know many of you may not want to listen to this but please, hear me out.

The primary goal for me was to get porn out of my mind, and quite frankly this subreddit does the opposite, seeing as this is suprisingly the most active subreddit I am subscribed to, every time I come onto reddit I am constantly bombarded by post after post of reminders to porn and masturbation, often by those who no longer actually need help anymore.
I felt like this was kind of an AA deal, but it stops being so nice after all you hear about is person after person talking of problems they **no longer have**.

The second reason for my leaving is the dogmatic reaction many posters here seem to have acquired. Many have perfectly normal responses to porn, while at the same time don't suffer from any negative effects of it. But time after time I hear of people not involved being referred to as ""**unenlightened**"", ""**unknowingly addicted**"", and worse, just because you are an alcoholic does not mean everyone should stop drinking as well.

None of you care about my opinion, but honestly what I am going to do is to unsub from this subreddit, set up a chains.cc account to track my days, and find someone who is also going through this to hold me accountable, while perhaps leaving this subreddit as a shortcut, to refer to when in need.

I was collaborating with my friends on Google+ and we were all trying to get this done. Around 4AM we were all seeing our respective papers finally come together and I was close to being done. All that remained was to format the paper, put my name at the top and get ready to hand it into the online dropbox. It was around this time my computer froze on me, and I hadn't saved my paper at all...

I looked in disbelief and in shock that my computer froze. I couldn't do anything, I sat there for 15 minutes just waiting for it miraculously start back up again. Hoping, praying that it would start up so I wouldn't have to re-do this paper. Nothing happened and finally I restarted my computer and crossed my fingers hoping Word's Auto Recovery File would save my paper. I got on Google+ again and told my friends what happened and they guided me on how to access where Word saves your document as it does every X Amount of minutes in case of crashes. I couldn't find the paper anywhere in the folder. I stopped, and was like, no worries maybe it's stored in a separate location. I went on google, searched how to recover lost word files. And I could not find where my paper had disappeared to where it was...It was gone

It was around 5AM, I looked at my screen and told my friends I'm getting off. At this point, I was depressed that all my hard work had just disappeared into thin air. All I wanted to do at that point was just fap. I got off Google+, opened up a new tab incognito on Chrome and went to my bookmarks all the way to the bottom of the list was a folder marked ""NSFW."" I clicked on it, and I clicked on a link of what used to be my favorite porn video. I pressed play and as I had my hands down my pants I just looked at the screen and said, ""Fuck this."" I slammed onto the ALT+F4 keys on my keyboard, opened up a new Word Document and started typing. Since I had most of my paper already done, I knew what to write and it was a breeze. I finished that paper in an hour and a half and by 7AM the time I normally wake up to go to school. I submitted my paper onto the online dropbox, took a shower and went on with today.

I realized it was my fault later on that I hadn't save my document otherwise I wouldn't have to go through this. I would've had at least 3 hours of sleep, and my resolve would not have shaken. But I'm glad it happened. It showed to me that what I have been fighting for these past 15 days was not for waste. It showed me that even during my lowest point when I had started this, I didn't give up. I didn't give up. I set out to change myself and that is exactly what I will do. Thank you for your time.

**TL;DR:** I lost 6 hours worth of work while writing a paper. I wanted to fap but I didn't and re-wrote my entire paper in an hour and a half.

**EDIT:** To all of you, thank you for the words of encouragement and telling me how I've inspired you and how I've made you proud. To be honest, your words are what motivate me to continue to beat PMO addiction and get past the 90 days. A lot of you said this was motivating/inspiring, but motivation is a daily thing.

Since I can remember, my mother has had serious health problems resulting in at least one major surgery a year. To pay off these medical bills as well as my sister's and my own tuition, my dad works a great deal of overtime, on the night shift, at his job. He would work all night, then sleep during the day. On his few days off, he would understandably be too tired to do anything but watch tv and have a couple beers. He was always the stoic type. My sister and I wished we had more time with him and my mother, stuck inside almost always because of her health, grew increasingly lonely. Yet, we understood because of all the sacrifices he made.
Then, 3 years ago, my mother discovered my dad had a PMO addiction. It soon came to light that he had since his teenage years. This was the final straw for her. Now, they fought almost daily and came to the brink of divorce. That same year he took a pay cut and my, now 5'6"" 275lb, father caught a major blood clot that could likely have been fatal. It was then he decided to change his life and break his 30+ year addiction.
Its been two years since he made the change. My mother is still very ill, college is still expensive, and he still works odd, long hours. But he is not the same man.
Today he is 53 years old. He is 100lbs lighter and all muscle. When he gets off his 10hr night shift at 7AM, he immediately does a 2hr workout. In his spare time he has rediscovered his love of gardening and created a beautiful garden around our home. Now he never drinks or has any PMO. He is now more open and I feel emotionally closer to him than I ever have before. Now he and my mother are rekindling their relationship and truly falling back in love.
Life is still hard, but my dad has rediscovered his passion for life and, more importantly, his love of himself.
He isn't a superhero. He is a man. A man I'm damn proud to call my father.
Today is day one. Time to follow his footsteps and become the man I want to be. If he can do it, so can I.

I am a MA/PHD student focusing on propaganda and philosophical systems. I am also an addict. I’ve prepped this essay for my own benefit (because like most academics, I’m highly obtuse) and the hopes that it will benefit some of the readers. If it does, please post and I’ll write more. After lurking for the last few weeks, I’ve been thoroughly impressed by the degree of self-awareness in so many on this forum, especially from young people. Self-awareness largely arises when people break out of the matrix of the propagandized system into which they were born. This has led me to develop a thesis that a pillar of our own propaganda system in contemporary America, and the wider West, is an extreme manipulation of human sexuality. 

Propaganda is composed of lies built on top of truths—i.e. the Germans are a great a noble people of history and accomplishment (truth) who have fallen only because of our society’s manipulation by the Jews (lie). Our own society is based on many good truths and virtues (i.e. the value of individual freedom, republican democracy, pluralism, etc) and many lies (i.e. fapping is good for you). One of the things that defines propaganda is that it does not allow people to think—to take pause and examine their life. In a word, silence. It totally encompasses their life whether at home through TV, computers, and newspapers or in public through posters, billboards, concerts, ‘role models,’ the cinema, etc. It also starts targeting people at the youngest of ages when they’re most vulnerable and malleable. All of us were propagandized in the classroom and in our homes. 

As everyone here knows, our culture is saturated in sex. You cannot avoid it. Growing up, my father did not keep pornography in the house. But my neighbor did, and I was good friends with his son who was of the same age. So, one day we snuck into his dad’s closet and I got to see my first Hustler magazine at the ripe old age of 8. The images from that first magazine are burned into my mind, with its airbrushed pictures of artificially enhanced women splattered in oil and contorted around the sexual organs of anonymous men. This was my first experience of human sexuality, which is wrong. It is a perverse and bent image of sexuality, yet already by brain was being shaped to accept it is true and good. My pre-pubescent self didn’t even know what I was looking at but something in me liked it. Naturally, the rest of much of my childhood was greatly defined by trying to acquire porn. I imagine this story is reflected in many people reading this. 

This is not freedom. This is the enslaving of our youth. I quoted St. Augustine above because he is one of history’s greatest philosophers of human freedom. He basically wrote that freedom is not being able to do whatever you want, but having the strength of will to do what one ought. If I can’t not look at porn, or take a drink, or a hit, or control my temper, I am not free. Something else controls me. One of Augustine’s great vices was sex, not for purpose of enhancing intimacy, or pro-creation, but to get-off. He lived in the sex-obsessed and pornographic world of ancient Rome at its decadent height, and when he tried to stop, he found that he couldn’t. His ‘Confessions’ are largely an autobiographical account of his struggle with his vice. Hence he’s history’s first fapstronaut. 

Human history is fully of religions, philosophic systems, etc. One of the reasons these systems were created is that people discovered whenever they tried to do anything on their own, they failed. Lofty goals like enlightenment, holiness, salvation, education, not-fapping, etc could not be accomplished by individuals acting alone—hence religions organized, philosophical schools were founded, monasteries built, and no-fap reddit pages were created. These things are the collective experience of people struggling towards the same goals (which is why the ‘Church of NoFap’ joke is as hilarious as it is profound). 

If any of you benefited from this essay, I’ll periodically post more over the next few months centered on this theme as I struggle with my own addiction. I’m starting the counter today. Wish me luck.

""For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself…After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison."" -C.S.

Porn and Masterbation.
We were married 13 years. She caught 1 months after we were married and I lied to her and said I would stop.

I would keep NoFap as my homepage because hearing stories of peoples success and hearing the encouragement from all the other community members was a huge boost to my resilience.

But lately I've noticed a trend here (which I'm sure others can attest to as well) of a certain kind of NoFappers that i refer to as ""FapNazis""

They think that motivation is equivalent to tearing someone down, telling them that ""real men don't fap"" or calling someone weak for relapsing.

the saddest part to me is that I've always noticed the increase of self-depricating posts. People in the community that thinks it's healthy for them to self-loathe because they've broken a streak of theirs, and other members encouraging that kind of behavior.

that's not okay

that's not how someone becomes a master of self-control. It turns into a self-defeating competition that you'll never win unless you're doing it for the right reasons.

I know that the popularity of NoFap has grown over the past few months or so, and I know it's only my opinion but I really wish the moderators or even better the community start cracking down on FapNazi type behavior, and lets get this place back to the encouraging and welcoming community that it needs to be.

I found it to be unnatural. After almost 3 months of doing it, I didn't find the urge to go away; I still wanted to fap, although it wasn't a daily thing anymore. It was more like every once in a while I'd feel like it, and last night was one of them. I don't think it's that bad to fap.

However, I think I've concluded that porn is the real source of the whole problem. What I really need to change in myself isn't how often (or whether I even do) fap, but how I see women and how I see sex. Porn is still off limits forever, but I don't to constantly be thinking about it and craving it.

My conclusion is to try and focus any sexual thoughts and feelings on reality, on true experiences. The biggest problem, I think, for a lot of people is that their sexual thoughts and arousal reactions are linked to imaginary forms of sex, namely porn. The simple fact is that real life sex is absolutely nothing like PMO. PMO won't prepare you for being with a real person; in fact, it will probably make it impossible, if your brain is used to getting aroused by porn instead of real people.

But fapping on its own, as a separate actions, I no longer see as the problem. I see fapping 10 times daily, as a way to pass the time, as a problem. I also see fapping to porn as a problem. But if every once in a while you get the urge, I think it's misguided to think that satisfying it just on your own will somehow negatively impact your life.

My goals now are these: don't fap just for the sake of it, don't watch porn (gonewild counts), focus on real life and distance myself from the internet.

This is all just my personal conclusion after almost 70 days. If any of you are still convinced that NoFap is the way to go, by all means, continue. I wish you luck. But I'm afraid I have to leave you.

NoFap, you make fools of us all.

Edit: I guess no one likes my story. Lots of downvotes. :(

Edit2: Okay u/ibedone pretty much nailed it, but I'll elaborate here. Yes, I'm a rocket scientist (rocket engineer, astronautical engineer, aerospace engineer take your pick; I mean that I work on rockets and I recently got my Aerospace Engineering degree). Yes, I can squat 450 lbs for one rep (455 if you want to be precise, but at that much weight, you have to knock off a few since you have to take deterioration of the iron into account); it's not that much, even for hobbyist weight lifter, but I'd be a liar if I said it didn't seem like an impossible amount 3 years ago. The point was that despite all this progress, especially since starting NoFap, I still have these moments of weakness; PMO is a humbling thing to get rid off.

Edit3: I am currently on vacation and was on a train from Krakow to a city in Ukraine where my relatives live. About 3 hours into the train ride, I dreamed a dream and it resulted in my first O in about 3-4 weeks. I don't believe anybody saw it directly other than what must've looked like a possible seizure, but fortunately, I was sleeping on a top bunk bed (during daytime), and after much emergency dick shifting to prevent the stain on my boxers from staining my jeans and laying there awkwardly staring at the ceiling, waiting for things to dry, I waddled to the bathroom to do some cleanup.

I have to say that this was my greatest fear since starting NoFap, but fortunately wasn't as bad as expected. Also, I'm beginning to realize that WDs are more a reaction to stress than horniness since I haven't felt too randy in quite a few weeks, but this all this traveling and lack of sleep probably did do a number on my stress levels.

My life is finally 100% confirmed to be back on the path I've always wanted it to be. **I am finally the man I've always wanted to be.**

I've had porn-induced ED since I was 17 years old (26 now). I started looking at porn a LOT when I was 13, and I've been addicted ever since. I have never once been able to have intercourse with a woman without the assistance of Viagra, and even when I had sex, I was fantasizing about porn the entire time. I would basically masturbate myself by using her lady parts instead of my hand. I would have to close my eyes the whole time and concentrate as hard as I could on the porn images in my head.

Well last night, after 198 days of nofap and no porn, I had sex with a beautiful woman without Viagra, and it. was. phenomenal. I had NO idea sex was supposed to feel like that.

I was feeling her body, I was into the moment, I was turned on by the act and the feelings that I was experiencing. I was NOT artificially turning myself on by fantasizing about my favorite porn videos. I never let my mind stray from being in the moment. I was passionate and committed to it, and it was everything I could have ever asked for.

After we finished, I laid there and was overwhelmed by how far I've come. She drifted off to sleep, and I laid next to her, eyes wide open, heart racing, remembering where I was 7 months ago... And where I am now. I couldn't help but to shed a tear of joy. It was the culmination of 7 months worth of extremely hard work and undying effort... And it all came together so beautifully.

Nofap has saved my life. This community has saved my life. I didn't realize what a shitty, disgusting gutter my life was in when I was fapping to porn 3 times a day for 13 years straight, but now... I see what life REALLY is, and I've never been happier.

That's pretty much all I wanted to say, but just as an update on the other aspects of my life - During nofap, I....

*Got a job that I love and pays 50% more.

*Worked out 5-6 times per week, every week

*Drastically changed my diet and lost 30 pounds, gained muscle - [First 3 pictures are from the first 90 days, then one picture from July 1](http://imgur.com/a/UgOIL)

*Began meditating

*Countless more measurable improvements

But the biggest improvement is just the general outlook on life. There's no more bullshit excuses holding me back. There's no more lying to myself about ANYTHING. Accepting my addiction to porn and dealing with it was extremely therapeutic, and it helped heal a lot more than I originally thought it would.

Nofap isn't for everyone. If you fap once or twice a week and you don't have an issue with it, then cutting it out of your life ISN'T going to give you superpowers... But if you were as low as I was, then it can truly send you soaring into space.

Nope. Ten times that.

Yesterday, I gave my sister away at her wedding. I knew this was coming for a year now and up until about a month ago, I never felt man enough to do it. Let me tell you about it.

During the rehearsal, everything went great. I saw the order of everything. I have incredible concentration now(super power 1). I see where things go and when people should start and stop their portion of the routine. I could have done any person's job that day because I saw it in motion before it happened.

During the wedding, no fear (super power 2). No worries about messing things up. In fact, I'm going around coordinating things. Making sure the caterers are where they should be and everything is getting done. 

The wedding starts. The bridal party walk one by one down the aisle. I wait on my sister. She comes out and she looks beautiful--exactly the way she should on her wedding day. She grabs my arm and I lead her down the aisle. The preacher asks ""who gives this woman to be married?"" ""Her mother and I do"" I say in my rich, confident baritone (superpower 3). I release her to her husband-to-be and I walk away, not needing attention like the boy I was so short a period ago.

During the reception, people come to me to make announcements because I ""speak with such authority"". I'm happy to oblige them. Where's awkward, worried me? Long gone, guys.

My mother comes to me and says I should make a toast. With 5 minutes notice? Sure, why not? I speak about how much I love her and how well I know her husband will take care of her. People come to me afterward and tell me that it was a great speech. One woman tells me that I honor my late father's memory with my life and my words. 

Guys, I'm not lying when I say this has been instrumental in my moving a position into what God would have for me in this world. Today, my father wasn't able to be there but a man still gave my sister away at her wedding. Whether you believe the way I do or not, I think we can all be sure in knowing that we weren't MEANT for this shit. 

Do you know the times that I've faked my body and mind into thinking that I'm sharing a moment with some girl on a computer monitor? I'm done with it. There's no way I could have been as aware and capable yesterday had I been using porn and fapping. My sister got the wedding she deserved and part of that is that her brother showed up as a man. 

How many people have I let down because I was fapping? Socially, professionally, emotionally...I've failed many people because of this. I've missed deadlines because of this. I've missed DATES because of this. In no way will porn and masturbation ever be something that can work for me. No, I like being a man. 

So if you're on the fence about starting, ask yourself what a man looks like. If you're on the fence about continuing because it's more difficult than you planned, ask yourself what a man looks like. If you've just relapse and you are swimming in regret, shame and self-pity, ask yourself what a man looks like. You have no idea what you can do in this world when you are freed from this bondage. Right now, rise above your own small discomfort and get your balls back.

I have been through numerous relationships, the men in which all watched porn regularly, fapped regularly, and told me that the fact that it bothered me was stupid. Porn didn't affect our sex lives, according to them, because it wasn't sex. It was unrelated, and it was controlling and ""bitchy"" of me to express any concern for their mental well being, or for me to even feel sad or hurt by it.

Since then I've mostly avoided dating out of the fear that I'm going to end up in the same situations. I already follow NoFap, largely, because I don't want to numb a real experience with a real guy. I'm an emotional person, and I want that physical connection.

I hadn't planned to ever make a post of my own on here.  But upon seeing my counter, a lot of people asked me to do so.  After a fair amount of convincing from all sides, I decided to oblige.

First of all, let me just say how impressed I am with this community, and how honored I am to be a part of it now.  I can't tell you how much I wish this had existed when I was in the process of quitting.  If you walk away from this post with just one message, let it be this: YOU **CAN** DO THIS, especially with the aid of this fine group of allies.

I guess I'll tell a little of my story, and then offer whatever advice I'm able to.  Of course, I'm happy to chat below as well.

I cut masturbation and pornography out of my life a little over six years ago, and it was one of the most important and positive things I have ever done.  I was seventeen at the time; I've now just turned twenty-four.  I had discovered masturbation in about the fifth grade, and I almost immediately became completely addicted.  I used a fair amount of porn over the years as an assist, but I'm lucky in that I never had an addiction to pornography itself.  So cutting that was pretty simple for me personally, which I'm very grateful for.

Cutting out masturbation, however, was not even a little bit simple.  In fact, it's easily one the hardest things I have ever done.

People have all sorts of reasons for doing this.  Mine were, in large part, religious.  I am a Catholic, and began getting much more involved in my faith during high school.  By junior year, I knew that overcoming this was a nonnegotiable.  The Church classifies masturbation as a mortal sin, i.e. one that, if done with full knowledge and full freedom, ""destroys charity in the heart of man"", as the Catechism puts it, rather than simply offending and wounding such charity, as venial sin does.

I know many of you are non-Catholics and non-Christians and atheists and whatever else.  I'm proud to stand by your side in this common battle regardless.  And of course, as a Catholic, I don't think my faith's moral laws are arbitrary or idiosyncratic, so I don't think this is a peculiarly Catholic issue by any means.  I think our ethical ordinances are precisely those directives that lead us to the achievement of true happiness and flourishing as human persons, which is something that's hardly exclusive to Catholicism.  (And to my mind, my experiences and those of others on this subreddit confirm that, at least in the case of masturbation and pornography, the Church seems to know what she's talking about here, in a way that should resonate with all people regardless of their religious tradition.)  So even if you're not Catholic, I hope you're able to glean some relatable lessons from my tale.  This is religious for me, sure, but it transcends faith lines.  This is a basic human issue, especially these days.

So then, it was junior year of high school, and I had decided I needed to quit.  In addition to being sinful (or rather, as an effect of its being sinful), masturbation was occupying my thoughts constantly.  It was turning me in on my own person, rather than orienting me towards love of others.  It had led to a screwed up view of girls, as we know all too well.  But in my case, it also led to a screwed up view of guys, in that I began to see myself and all my guy friends as merely sexual beings.  This made forming close friendships tough--not because I was attracted to my guy friends, but precisely because I wasn't (at least in anything more than a superficial sense).  I figured true intimacy was only appropriate in sexual relationships, having lost the ability to see people as much more than walking genitals.  If I wasn't going to be gay with my friends, I didn't know how to get truly close to them.  So while I didn't completely understand it then, I was profoundly lonely, even though I was athletic and academically successful and had a lot of ""friends"".

At that point, I knew I needed to quit.  But I didn't want to quit yet.  So I struggled in a half-ass way with it for a few months, never lasting more than a day or two.  Yet the frustration of those failures, and the accompanying realization that I was truly addicted, strengthened my resolve.  It also served a healthy dose of humility: I became 100% convinced that I could not do this alone.

Thus, I reached out to a few close friends--individually at first, but eventually we all came together as a support system for each other.  Unsurprisingly, they'd all had similar struggles and were saddled with similar addictions.  So we entered into this battle together, which made all the difference in the world.  Sure, we'd hold each other accountable, but it was way more than that.  We suddenly had a truly *common* cause.  When overcoming masturbation especially, I believe this is essential, because the sin works by turning what is essentially an other-directed capacity 180 degrees around, focusing it exclusively on me, myself, and I.  Having others to cooperate with brought me out of myself, and this in itself was a HUGE assist.  We'd check in with each other frequently about it.  But we'd also just call each other when we were feeling tempted.  Even if we didn't talk about the temptation itself on those calls, but instead just shot the shit re: sports or school or whatever, those conversations likewise helped bring us out of our own individual bubbles and escape temptation.

It still wasn't easy.  In fact, the first few weeks were positively dreadful.  I relapsed a couple times, miserable every time it happened, and viscerally aware that I was set back in my mission.  (I'm happy for all those on here who say they have ""superpowers"" at that early stage, but I felt more like I was strapped with kryptonite for at least a few weeks.)  This back-and-forth went on for a couple months, succeeding and failing at various points, making progress relative to where I'd been before, but still comfortably in the clutches of the addiction.

But finally, I was able to push past those first few weeks after falling.  It's not that it became immediately simple.  This addiction had been an architectonic facet of my daily life for the better part of a decade, so it was going to take a while to truly uproot it.  But things settled down considerably.  And at that point, I was so determined never to relive those early days of the struggle, that convincing myself to resist became a lot easier to do.

In time, I'm so grateful to say, it did just dissolve into a non-issue, or at least a non-live-issue.  (I still face temptation from time to time, of course, even six years later, but it's not even close to insurmountable, which is how it felt back then.)  It no longer occupies my thought all the time, and I'm immensely happier as a result.  I've had successful romantic relationships (in the sense of intimate and happy relationships that succeeded, in the course of time, in showing us that we weren't right for each other in a 'til-death-do-you-part sense).  And I now, thankfully, have guy friends I am incredibly close with, with no genital sexual component as either a consideration or a fear.  In short, life is exceptionally better without masturbation, even if that's incredibly hard to believe when we're still in its clutches.

One interesting thing to me about the whole healing process was this: Masturbation had been such an overwhelming addiction for me that it had successfully blinded me to every other problem area in my life / character.  It wasn't until I had successfully overcome it that I was able to see myself more clearly and comprehensively, and begin solving other issues as well.  (E.g., it used to be when I went to Reconciliation, I'd confess masturbation and then BS a few other invented sins that didn't seem all that accurate or pressing at the time, speaking mostly in abstractions.  Now, I can actually see how many things there are for me to confess honestly, and then to work on improving on.  And that's a great and positive thing--I get to understand where I need work and how to keep striving towards fulfillment and flourishing.  That may not mean much to a non-Catholic, but I promise, it was and is huge to me.  It's self-knowledge, plain and simple.)

So now, six years later, I'm here to tell you that overcoming this is possible, no matter how far gone you are today.  I'm also here to tell you that overcoming this is worthwhile--SO WORTHWHILE.  Please don't give up.  You can and should absolutely do this.

I'll end off with just a few pieces of advice.  (I hardly think myself a sage on this or any issue, but I'm also happy to converse in the comments re: particular questions, etc.)

(1) **You cannot do this alone.**  This subreddit is so stellar for building an online community of allies in common cause, but I suspect for most of us that isn't enough either.  So reach out to your brother, or to your best friend, or to several friends, or to whomever you can to support you in this.  This addiction thrives in the darkness and in isolation.  To overcome it, bring it to light and let others help you, in whatever capacity that makes sense in your life.

(2) **Resolve that you're really done with this for good.**  (Soon-to-be-Saint) John Paul II had a line I think is dead-on: ""The person who does not decide to love forever will find it very difficult to really love for even one day.""  The same applies here, I believe.  If my goal is ultimately to go a month and nothing more, I won't even go a month, because there’s no real difference between lasting thirty minutes and lasting thirty days, in an ultimate sense.  To really move beyond this weakness, we need to make a radical move that takes radical determination, knowing that it will ultimately lead to radical results and incredible happiness.

(3) **Take it one day at a time** (and sometimes just one hour or one minute at a time, when you're especially tempted).  Yes yes, as per #2, I think committing for life is a must.  But visualizing that whole lifespan, especially in a moment of temptation, will likely lead to despair and to relapse.  Focus on victory in the present moment.  ""Sufficient for a day [or millisecond, depending] is its own evil.""  And celebrate those small victories.  You'll be rightly proud if you can survive those moments.  Smile--you've earned it (and see #5 below).

(4) **Hard-mode or bust.**  Now obviously, that's different for those who are married.  But for the rest of us, becoming Fapstronauts just so we can then go out and get a bunch of tail more successfully is bullshit.  After all, the problem with pornography, with using women on the internet, isn't the ""on the internet"" part, but is rather the ""using women"" part.  Overcoming our addictions to doing that solo--either via visual stimuli or mental fantasies--is huge.  But it's a meaningless battle if I then head to a party a hook up with a hot stranger / acquaintance.  I'll have essentially just subbed her vagina for my hand, with the same perverse and self-centered purpose.  That is, in some ways, even worse, because it completely demeans her while also keeping me solidly lodged in the same filth I've been stuck in all along on my own.

(5) **Smile.**  Yes, this is fucking difficult and some days it sucks.  But you're doing something amazing for yourself, and you're going to be so much better because of it.  Actually, scratch that--you ARE so much better because of it, even in the midst of the battle.  You may not feel great yet, but you will.  You should be incredibly proud of yourself.  Don't take yourself too seriously throughout the process, even though obviously this is a serious matter.  Live life.  Do other things.  Enjoy yourself.  Thrive.  Smile.

(6) **Don't fetishize the counter.**  It's a great tool.  We need internal and external motivators as men, social animals that we are.  But freaking out about when and when not to reset becomes legalistic and pointless.  You're in this for freedom and virtue, not for a high number for its own sake.  Obsessing over your relative impressiveness is pride and nothing more, and that's counterproductive beyond belief.

(7) **Serve others.**  Maybe that means supporting each other on here, but hopefully it also means finding a place where you can go be generous outside the NoFap context.  As I said, one of the most important things in this battle is getting out of yourself, since masturbation works by closing you in on yourself.  In learning generosity, we equip ourselves to slay this beast.

(8) Finally--and I acknowledge off the bat that this one is particularly Catholic and will be received variously from various vantage points, which is fine--, **PRAY!**  I said in #1 you can't do this alone.  That's still true.  But that doesn't just mean that I as an individual man can't overcome this alone; it also means we as men collectively cannot do so either.  We need divine assistance like no other here.  So, at the risk of being really crude, instead of spending time hand-to-dick, spend it knee-to-floor.  Gaze on that crucifix, knowing that if he could do that on Good Friday for love of you, you can absolutely do this for love of him.  Pray to the Immaculate Heart of Our Lady, who is such a crucial ally in this battle for purity.  Ask the Saints to intercede for you, especially St. Thomas Aquinas (whose own zeal for chastity inspired my username here).  Go before the Blessed Sacrament--though don't let yourself receive if you've fallen but not made it to Confession yet--, and just waste time with God in his salvific presence.  He'll transform you into the best man you can be, molding you in his own image.  As Charles Peguy said, ""In the end, life offers only one tragedy: not to have been a saint.""  Be a saint.

In closing, know that, whoever you are, regardless of your sex or your religion or your age or your history or whatever else: YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY DO THIS.  I stand before you (still broken in all sorts of respects, of course, but) free of this, and so immensely happy as a result.  There is a better life for you beyond this.  Never ever doubt that.

Peace to you all.  Fight on!

Don't be the guy with three children, a loving wife, and a crippling addiction to porn. That guy who avoids his 18 year old daughter.  The guy who refuses to have ""guy talks"" with his 11 year old son.  Don't be the guy who spends all his time at work, trying to avoid going home.  

**DON'T BE THAT GUY.**

I just got done holding my girlfriend as she sobbed her heart out to me.  Her father has hurt her so much.  He has never shown her the love that she needs.  He has not been there for her to tell her how beautiful she is.  He has not comforted her when she cried.  He has not shown her respect and love.  He gave all his love to his hand and that computer screen.  Now when I tell her how breathtaking she is, she can't believe me.  She wants to, but it always sounds like a lie to her.

**DON'T BE THAT GUY.**

Change now, don't end up with a daughter who no longer tries to love you.  Don't get to the point where your family simply expect you to fail again.  Don't get to the place where your wife doesn't care what you do anymore.  Don't think this is some game.  You will never know how much you effect others until it's to late.  None of us are islands.  We all affect the people around us.  

**DON'T BE THAT GUY**

They relapse on day 12, and say that the next time they will make it to at least day 13. On that day of relapse they usually binge, and go absolutely fap-crazy for hours, often cumming multiple times while watching porn because ""I have already reset the counter anyway"".

I've been on nofap on and off for 1½ years now (Dealing with an extreme addiction). I have learned something over the past month or so, that I invite you to experiment with. My focus has been a non-indulgent relapse. That means that whenever I do relapse, I will only fap ONCE and then get back up on the horse. I've relapsed 3 times over the past month, which means that I have only fapped 3 times over the past month.

Here are some things I've noticed since I stopped binging:

 - My erections are now rock-hard and stay that way. Even on the day after a relapse.
 - While the NoFap superpowers ARE diminished a bit when I relapse, they are not diminished by all that much. They used to disappear completely when I binged.
 - I feel stronger overall. Don't quite know how to explain it.

I may not have made it past 14 days this month, but I have gotten so much more out of the experience than I did when I was binging like crazy. And so it has occured to me that while long streaks of abstinence are important, it's also very important to look into why we relapse, and the nature of our relapse. Going directly back to nofap after an accident seems like it's not tempting at all, when you consider that the counter won't know if you have fapped once or 10 times on that day. But don't. You'll ruin the work you've already built. You can keep a LOT of what you have gained if you don't go nuts. Only fap that once, and get back to nofap.

I wanted to chime in with some observations that I've been thinking about for the past couple of years. 

First I will describe a pattern that seems to recur among many of the girls I know (I'm in my late 20s now, have lived in a large metro area in the US for about 10 years). This dynamic has happened to me too, on numerous occasions, but I'm also generalizing from what many of my friends have experienced.

Okay, so imagine you are a girl, single, and there's a guy you know, also single. He could be a coworker, or a friend-of-a-friend. You get along well when you hang out in group settings. You think he's smart, funny, good-looking -- lately the two of you have flirted a little, very gently, and you wonder what it would be like to date him. After some flirtatious exchange, he asks you out for dinner or drinks. You are excited. You show up. He is there and looks nice, but as you sit down, you have a fleeting worry that he seems a little ""down"". The charge from your last flirtation isn't there right now, but you remind yourself that maybe it's just a tiny bit awkward because it's a first date. You order drinks and start chatting, still excited to spend some time with him, and looking forward to finding that common groove again. He is great company, a good listener, tells you a funny story, and you're having a really nice time, but as the date goes on, you cannot help but notice that the energy between you too is totally platonic. You start to feel the tiniest bit sad; earlier, you were absolutely certain that he was attracted to you--the way his eyes held yours, the timber of his voice, some subtle tension in his body language--but now, all of that seems to be gone. You wonder if you had just imagined it all; maybe there's some other girl that he's more interested in, an ex-girlfriend who's back in the picture or something, and he just kept this date with you to be polite. You stop wondering what it would be like if you were more than friends; he just doesn't seem as interested in you anymore. You feel very silly. If the date ends with a kiss, it's quick and perfunctory. 

I have no evidence to support this (except anecdotal) but I am personally certain that girls can sense the lack of sexual urgency on the part of their potential male partners. It's very confusing for us, especially when everything else seems to be in place (appearance, personality, intelligence) to suggest that you would make good sexual partners. ""I thought that guy was into me, but I guess he doesn't care?""

In contrast, there have been other times when I've had some slight interaction with some other guy, and I can just pick up on this current of attraction, very primal, coming from him. Even if it's someone I don't know well, or haven't thought about much before, it's like an atmospheric shift is happening around you. You can sense it in the same way you can sense a storm building up in the sky. It feels magnetic, and exciting. (Not, of course, that this is so powerful as to overwhelm rational thought or anything, but I definitely pick up on it, and likely it will make me start thinking a bit more about that fellow, even if I never have before.) Basically, I think many women are attracted to passionate men. That's why I think the common Reddit advice of ""masturbate before you go on a first date"" is actually really, really terrible and counterproductive. It doesn't make a guy seem ""relaxed,"" it makes him seem apathetic. 

Anyway, I just wanted to say that I appreciate this sub a lot -- you all have my support and admiration -- keep up the amazing and inspiring effort! There are so many women out there who will appreciate it :)",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,,True,t3_1gq899,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gq899/how_pmo_may_effect_a_first_datefrom_a_womans/,

I don't know how to meet girls. Etc etc"".

I'd like to give back to this community by sharing a simple philosophy that has brought me plenty of success in that department.

Who am I? Just a guy who's recently come to the realization that he was carrying an addiction to porn and fapping that has contributed to countless missed opportunities. I've finally decided to do something about it. Unlike many in this group though, I don't have problems speaking to girls, it's only that porn came first and was easier, so I've developed an addiction to it. I now believe that it's in part responsible for ruining some potentially great relationship I might have had.

First of, I'm no pick up artist, don't expect any silver bullet system. Also, this philosophy doesn't require that you'd have a sense of humour or that you'd be witty. It simply relies on your willingness to do one thing that 90% of other guys won't do, approach women. I call this  *planting the seed of possibilities*. You'll understand why in a moment.

This is just one way to meet girls among many, but it's the one that has yielded the most results over time for me. It only requires that I'd have the guts to ask a girl out on a date. That's it. Whether she accepts or rejects the proposal, step 1 of the mission has been successfully completed and the *seed of possibilities* has been planted.

I will now share 3 true life situations that have happened to me at separate periods in my life. There have been many others that have gone similary, but these 3 come to mind at the moment. Hopefully your outlook about approaching women might change.

Once upon a time, I was attracted to a cashier at a food court restaurant I used to lunch at. One day after my lunch, I invited her to go out with me, she thanked me for the invitation, but told me she had a boyfriend.

Another time, near my workplace, I used to visit a drugstore for candies and knick-knacks. Working there was a beautician that I found very feminine and attractive, but had never talked to. One day, I went to ask her some beauty advices for men, as she started with her explanations, I interrupted her and confessed that I had just cooked up an excuse to talk to her and that I just wanted a chance to invite her out. She was flattered, but she had a boyfriend. 

Yet another time, there was this girl that worked at the public library. On my way to return a book, I told her that I had an hypothetical question. What could a guy who is a member of the library do to invite a girl in the staff out to diner. She laughed, I laughed and she asked who was the girl, I told her to guess. She guessed, she was flattered, but she had a boyfriend. 
I think you start to see the pattern.

Now, it turns out none of these girls really had boyfriends. They were just gently rejecting my advances because they didn't know what else to do in the heat of the moment. Something interesting then started to happen. Since I still had to visit these various places, I continued to see them. During our brief encounters, I remained polite and welcoming. I would greet them with a genuine smile, inquired about how they were doing and acted as if nothing had ever happened before. It was as if to me, it was just business as usual, I had asked them out, they had said no to my proposal and I'd now moved on with my life. No drama, no big deal. 

Interestingly enough, over time they also became friendlier with me and more open during our interactions. The girl at the food court started to take her lunch with me. The girl at the drugstore pretended to have problems with her computer as an excuse to go out for coffees with me (I had told her that I work with computers). When my library card expired, I didn't renew and stopped going. Turns out the girl at the counter started asking one of my friends if he had any news from me and why wasn't I coming anymore.

Sometimes a girl has no idea that you exist and therefore has no opinion of you. She doesn't like you, she doesn't dislike you. Then one day you make an entrance into her radar by revealing that you think she's cute. Right away her defense mechanisms go up and she rejects you. 

What she doesn't know though is that it's too late, by making your proposal you've already *planted the seed of possibilities* in her head. She now has an option she didn't have before. There's an offer on the table that is difficult to ignore. Whether she wants it or not, she has to consider the possibility that she could have a relationship with you. As she explores this idea, she starts pondering about you. She wonders if she finds you attractive, weird, quirky, ugly. She wonders if it could just be casual, formal, long term, friendly. She asks herself why she rejected you in the first place since after a more careful observation over the past 3 weeks, she finds you kinda cute. Maybe if she could just get you to change the way you dress or your haircut. She wonders why you don't seem more affected by her rejection. Could you have found someone new? Do you still think she's cute? By now she's asked a friend or a coworker to check you out and they've agreed that you're not bad looking. She wonders if you're going to make another move, she's certainly going to have to do something to encourage you into making another attempt.

Obviously, this doesn't always go like this, if the girl isn't into you, she isn't, but provided that you've made some minimal efforts to look presentable, you stand some good chances to take your cause into appeal.

So, next time you're afraid to talk to a girl, don't think of it as you laying your soul bare to her, rather think of it as you *planting the seed of possibilities* in her mind and just walk away and let it take roots.

- No watching porn. Use filters, particularly at the beginning of your journey.
- No 'just one pic/vid', 'just a quick check'; I guarantee you, you'll end up relapsing. Adopt zero tolerance behavior.
- No edging.
- If you feel an uncontrollable urge, get busy **fast**. Do situps and pushups instead, go out for a jog, start cooking something, whatever.
- Leave your bedroom door open.
- No facebook bikini pics. Basically nothing that isn't real live sex (read: only standard PIV, no fetishes).
- **For those with ED:** No sex until you really *feel* like having sex, and that's when you get hornier at super-mild stuff that previously didn't even made you twitch. Get at least 2-3 months of strict NoFap under your belt. When you get there, sex is OK, but don't go overboard. Oh, and beware the 'chaser effect' (wanting to PMO after experiencing sex), you'll need plenty of experience for that one!
- Delete all the porn in your drive. **NOW**. No questions.
- Morning wood is a good sign of progress.
- Wet dreams are a sign of progress. Don't reset your badge.
- Flatlines *will* happen (the zero libido/emotion period). They're universally hated by NoFappers. IMO, they mostly occur because of leading a bad lifestyle: bad/few friends, bad/no girlfriend, stress, depression due to other factors, utter lack of chances of getting laid, etc. I dealt with that and they never visited me again.
- Dead-dick effect *will* happen (feeling like your dick is very limp/doesn't work anymore). With time it'll go away.
- Create the habit of going out running/cycling/hitting the gym/whatever. It is fucking imperative that you do some kind of physical activity.
- Absolutely *never* say no to a hangout/date/party/any kind of social gathering. You'll be glad you didn't when you're there.
- Avoid long periods of idleness at all costs. Particularly if there's a computer nearby.
- Don't expect magical enhancements out of nowhere. Use your newfound energy to get yourself out there and stir shit up.
- Blue balls *will* happen, just endure the ache for a day or two and they'll be gone.
- Your semen may get a yellowish hue. It's perfectly OK.


And most important...

- No quitting. Even if you relapse, keep going.",,False,,t5_2skrn,1343421706.0,,,True,t3_x8l27,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/x8l27/protips/,

The sex is everwhere.  It is subliminal in our media, sometimes just outright in front of us, and it affects us.  It makes us turn to the internet instead of pursuing the real thing.  You can’t even go on Facebook without seeing that hot girl taking uber-photoshopped butt photos with her tight black yoga pants on! (So stop using Facebook to replace your Pornhub addiction)


###EVERYTHING MAKES US WANT TO FAP!

##And because of this reason it’s time for some men to step up. Why?

1.	**You can achieve a level of self control like never before**; no generation before us has experienced this level of sexual temptation like us, as we feel like we have to FAP just to think clearly (mistake).
2.	**You’ll become a highly sexually energized  individual**; which is actually good thing, and I will tell you why later.
3.	**You will lose that weird “fap/porn addict awkwardness”  vibe forever when talking with another woman**  (And it’s not because you’re an introvert, introversion is actually an advantage with women)

Talk to people who haven’t fapped nor watched porn atleast 5 months!  They are excited about life!  They are reaching their full human potential and are able to do what most men aren’t!  They now have the discipline to “work from home” if they want to; because they know they aren’t going to blow half their day on some lame porn site!  This happiness, this excitement, and rejuvenation goes a long way.

##This is what is going to happen with you during NoFap

-	You are going to stop fapping, when you do it’s going to be hard at first, and you are going to be frustrated.  Sometimes you aren’t going to be able to focus on your projects, your assignments, because the only thing that you are going to be thinking about is fapping.  NoFAPPING

-	Eventually, you may go through a flatline period, you may be sad, you will walk down the halls and no women are interested, nobody cares; and you don’t care about anything, you don’t care about sex, and you don’t really care about any goals. **During this phase, you discover that without your sex drive, you have no passion in life**

-	This phase ends; and then your sex drive returns, however, you can control it this time, you want to meet real women, and you still can’t concentrate because you want to meet real women; this phase passes. Kind of.  In the sense that, **DURING THIS PHASE, FAPPING HAS BEEN ELIMINATED FROM YOUR BRAIN AS AN OPTION.**; Whether it's your wife, girlfriend, or a girl you are trying to get with; you have to make it happen, otherwise, you're screwed, you don't have thousands of willing sex objects on the internet to fall back on anymore.

-	Eventually, you’ll start to use this high sex drive energy in other areas of your life, you’ll start exercising, become more passionate about your job, you’ll quit other addictions, you will want to eat better.

-	You will feel better, look better, interact better, and the percentage of women that are attracted to you will go up TENFOLD.  Maybe not like grown up Justin Bieber, “Omg marry me because you’re hot and rich, please have my babies” ; but more like “Hmm…if I really analyze my feelings, this guy is one of the most all around attractive guys I personally know”, type of attraction.

1.	Your personality will be more magnetic than before
2.	You will tap into your leadership more than before
3.	Interacting with the opposite sex will feel more like a necessity (if that’s your goal), and less like a burden 

Basically don’t quit, unless you have a FAP quota to hit before you die.  If that’s not you, then embrace this opportunity.

However, for me to know if I have it, I would need to do a spermogram, which involves basically putting my sperm into a tube.

The problem is: my sexual abstinence must not be greater than 5 days, which means that I'll have to Fap 2 times for this exam.

""And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman.

For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival.

Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity.

In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself. . . . After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. Masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison.”

The question I was asked was familiar to most of us.  ""I keep relapsing... I think about sex all the time... I have to fap just to be able to move on to more productive things... what is your secret?""

There are three important things that help keep me on track.  ""Secrets"", if you will.  They are not rocket surgery, but I wanted to share these with the community.

The first one is accountability.  There are three people who know what I am doing, and why.  On days when the urge gets horrid, I replay in my head what it would be like to look them in the eye and say ""I was weak.  I failed.""  I can't stand even thinking about it, and it is an instant urge-killer.

The second important thing is to call a spade a spade.  Get real:  When your brain tells you ""just get it over with and fap so you can be productive"", that is bullshit.  That is the self-justification of an addicted man.  

Because this IS an addiction.  Whether you want to call it addiction to porn, fapping, arousal, whatever... your brain desperately wants the dopamine hit that rubbing one out will give you, and it will tell you anything to get you to go ahead and submit.  Don't be a bitch.  Don't fall for such an obvious sell.

The third ""secret"" is good old fashioned machismo.  Put that bottled up testosterone to its proper use:  Man the fuck up.  Take control back from your addiction.  Every day I add a number to my counter is a day I FUCKING WIN.  Sometimes it is easy.  Sometimes I feel like I went through a heavyweight bout.  But I win.  Every.  God.  Damn.  Day.  And I never want to stop winning.  I imagine going to bed defeated.  My will broken.  My manhood slowly soaking through a soggy tissue.  My badge grinning at me like a bitch.  

Fuck everything about that.  I win.  Day 57, sucka!",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,year1,True,t3_zvrd4,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/zvrd4/the_secrets_are_simple/,

You've all helped me stay on track and be motivated to succeed - and I hope I've done the same for at least one person.  I decided to also tell my brother last night.  He came over, we had a beer, and I had him read the exact same email.  Now I have a team around me, and we're going to do a lot of things (internet filter, weekly checkins, more connections, volunteer work, possibly seeing a professional) to make sure I can overcome this.  We decided to let it soak in for the newcomers, and we're all going to sit down next week and make a plan.  I'm open to helping anybody on here via PM, so please let me know if I can help you.  And I'll try to reply to everyone, but thankfully I have a busy day on not touching my dick ahead of me!  Keep kicking ass everyone!

------------------

As you can see by my flair, I'm only on my second day.  After emailing with my mom earlier today, she said that she found of box of my old stuff and said: ""I am going to bring you the file as well because, my son, you were quite the stud in your young life.  So very many accolades.  Somewhere along the way, you seemed to quit believing in yourself.  I think it would be good for you to go through this file and see what you were and still are capable of.""

I replied that I already knew I was a failure, and then got into a bit of a pity party, telling her that I wished I could tell her the truth, but I just couldn't, and it would break her heart.  Of course, she's a mom, so she said I could tell her anything.  I decided to honey badger this shit and just lay it on her.  So I wrote a long email, and then texted her to get Dad and go read it in their bedroom (relatives live with them, don't want them involved).  In the hope that I can inspire other fapstronauts to get over their fear of involving loved ones in this transformation, I'm pasting the letter below (with redactions/changes for privacy)(also, my family isn't shy with the cussing, as you will see)**:**

-----------------------

What changed?  It wasn't really ""an event"", but a series of things.  You want to know, so I'll tell you, but I'd recommend that you are sitting down when you read this, because it's gonna hurt.

So I was much like most teenagers.  When it came to sex though, I was very naive and unprepared.  But since I was smart and good with computers, I found out a lot about sex from the internet.  I know you know that with how many times you caught me with porn.  Now, without grossing my out too much, I'm sure you've seen porn before.  Porn is not sex.  But it is a sex substitute.  I was quickly able to get a hold of a lot of porn.  Teenagers are horny, they masturbate a lot, and in these days, they watch porn.  So what?

Well, I lost my virginity at 16.  It was less exciting than I wanted it to be.  It felt good and all, but it wasn't porn.  It was quick, awkward, and then felt extremely weird afterward.  I'm sure you're familiar with the limited talks I had with you guys about sex - ""Wear a rubber"" was about the only advice Dad had for me.  Thankfully, I did follow that.

So I had sex a couple times, and then not for awhile.  In between, I watched plenty of porn.

The next time I tried to have sex (at 17 years old), I couldn't keep an erection.  Yes, ""this happens to all guys"", but holy shit was that a confidence killer.  The girl was really hot, I really liked her, there was no reason for things not to work.  But I wasn't really turned on.  It was sort of meh.  So that sucked, but I didn't give up.  I tried again - fail.  I tried again - fail.  I never tried again until college, because I thought college would solve my problems.  It didn't.

I met some girls at college.  Went on some dates.  Tried sex a couple of times - it didn't work.  So I retreated.  You know when I could keep an erection?   Watching porn.  So I went deep down the rabbit hole, and developed the horrible habits that I'm still trying to kick to this day.  Everyone masturbates from time to time, but I started masturbating 2, 3, 4 times/day.  Why do you think I dropped out of college?  You didn't honestly think it was just drugs and alcohol, did you?  I could skate through classes like it was nobodies business.  But I started staying home from class because my roommate was gone then, so I could watch porn.  It became what I did to pass time, when I was nervous, when I was tired, when I was anxious, when I was excited, when I had something to do, when I had nothing to do...

Remember that girl **** that I dated?  Why do you think we broke up?  Ugh, this is so awkward to be writing to my mom, but let me tell you something: there is no worse feeling than not being able to get an erection with a girl you are into.  She couldn't understand that it wasn't her.  And girls want to have sex - she was a cute girl, and wasn't going to wait around for a guy that couldn't get his dick to work properly.  That was pretty much the final shot for me.  I gave up.

Do you have any idea what life is like if you know (I know that's wrong, but its how I felt at the time) that you'll never pleasure a partner?  I wanted to get married and have kids, build a family, travel the world, have fun, and share it with a significan other.  Well, all of that was out the window.  I had no prospects for my future.  I tried to fill the void - I thought I could work myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought I could drug myself through it, that didn't help.  I thought setting big external goals like going to law school would help, it didn't.  By the time I graduated college, I was miserable.  I was working a shit job only because my mom had got it for me, I had a shit degree from a shit college that I wasn't going to do shit with.  None of my strategies had helped.  I couldn't care about a life where I wasn't ever going to be able to pleasure a woman.  I kept working at the law firm because fuck it, who cares?

At this point, I was still masturbating 2-6 times/day (I'm so sorry to gross you out).  Why did I quit the law firm?  Another strategy to try to get rid of this!  I thought that once I was in control of my life, I could kick the habit.  As I'm sure you can guess, that didn't happen.  Working from home only made it easier.  And with all the self doubt I had from this shit, I just kept feeding it.  Even when I was completely in control of my own life, I'd just waste the entire day in bed, hating myself, hating my life, hating what I had come to.  I made enough money to get by, but just barely.

Now, I'm at damn near rock bottom.  I have tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt and nothing to show for it.  I haven't paid my student loans in a year - they are going to collections.  I own nothing, I have no plans for the future.  What's the point?  I can't ever have what I want.  I don't think you can possibly understand how bleak life is when you know you can never have what you want.

Somehow though, I haven't given up yet.  My back is against the wall.  I'm going to miss my credit card payments in a week, and then I really don't know what I'm going to do.  And it's not because I can't make money - I have people begging me to do work for them.  But whats the point of getting out of bed if you know that your whole day is just going to be spent hating yourself?  Some days I just wouldn't get out of bed at all, literally.  I'd cycle through porn and masturbation, smoking weed and browsing the internet, and crying myself back to sleep.  EVERYTHING in my life is because of this.

It's why I don't do anything with my life.  It's why I don't do stand up comedy, even though I'd be amazing at it.  It's why I never owned my own restaurant, even though it was a dream of mine and I'd kill it.  It's why I didn't go to law school.  WHAT IS THE POINT OF ANY OF THAT IF YOU WILL NEVER HAVE WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE?  Why should I get up on stage and make girls laugh if I can't take any of them home with me?  Or worse - take them home and ruin the night because I can't get it up.  There are only so many times that a guy can see the ""What do you mean you can't get it up?"" face.  And unfortunately, I'm just not evil enough to only want money in life.  What's the point of having money if you can't spend it on taking a beautiful girl out to dinner because you know you can't take her home later?  You know why I quit playing soccer?  That abdominal pain I have? Its from ruining my pelvic muscles with constant masturbation.  I'm ruining myself, body and mind.

But, like I said, I haven't given up.  In fact, in the last year, I've discovered that I'm not alone, not at all - thousands of young men from all walks of life are currently in the same prison.  I really didn't think anyone else could possibly live this life and not kill themselves.  It's so horrible.  It's not a regular addiction like cigarettes or booze or drugs.  It's not something I can announce on facebook: ""Two days without porn everyone! Yay me!""  It's a prison that no one can see.  And, worst of all, it is completely free.  I don't have to rob or steal to get my fix, I just have to keep paying my comcast bill.  Speaking of that, some of my money problems do stem from porn - I was sued for illegally downloading movies.  I went to a lawyer, and he recommended that I just settle, even though I could probably beat it, but it would be long and public.  So I settled for $3500 that I didn't have.  Ugh.

But like I said, I haven't given up.  I'm trying to kick this horrible situation.  I don't know right now if you understand how grave this situation is for me, or if you think it's all a joke.  So here are a couple of links that might help:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSF82AwSDiU - The Great Porn Experiment - a TED talk by the leading researcher on this stuff.

www.yourbrainonporn.com - Information, resources, and support for people in my situation.

www.reddit.com/r/nofap - Where I'm going for support to try to get out of this.  It's semi-anonymous which helps me be open.

Most people that have successfully beat this problem go through the following phases: The tough initial stage (1-7 days), a clarity phase (8-30 days, give or take), a flat-line where you have 0 libido (at any time, usually only lasts a couple of weeks), and then it gets better, the libido comes charging back, the ED is gone, and sex is pleasurable again.  They advocate a no-PMO lifestyle (no Porn, Masturbation, or Orgasm).  This is only until you have rewired your brain to enjoy natural sex and respond to it appropriately.  Masturbation is not the demon, its the way we masturbate to modern pornography that makes the difference (pay attention to the part of the youtube clip where he shows that older people recover faster than younger people, because their problems didn't develop UNTIL they got high speed internet whereas the younger generation has always had it).

I've tried to quit this horrible, degrading, demotivating lifestyle multiple times.  I don't know if you've ever noticed, but whenever we go on family vacation, I'm usually pretty miserable on days 2-4.  Those are the days that I'm adjusting to not getting my fix.  I usually want to kill somebody when I wake up, but as the day goes along, and if we stay busy enough, I get through it.  But as soon as I get back home, it's right back to where I left off.

I've thought about asking my brothers for help, but I don't think they would understand.  I've sort of told ****** about some of it (gee - why do you think ****** and I have never got together?).  Hell, there was a point when I thought maybe I was just gay and I wasn't getting it, as I know others have speculated.  Well, I tried it out once, it didn't do it for me.  I told dad once that I was having erection problems, and he told me to go to the doctor.  I did, and he told me its nothing physical (I knew that, because I could easily get an erection with porn).  I even went to a psychologist for a bit, but that shit is mega expensive, and it seemed like I knew as much as he did (why do you think I took psychology classes in college?).

So there it is Ma.  That is what happened to me.  I don't think you can possibly comprehend the look on a girls face when she's begging you to fuck her and all you can say is ""I can't right now.""  I don't think you have any idea what it feels like to expect your life to be unfulfilling forever.  It's extremely hard to pursue your goals if you know you'll never be able to share them with anybody.  And please don't tell me that if I found the right girl, it wouldn't matter.  It DOES matter.  It's huge.  Women deserve a man that can love them, and they know that.  I wouldn't want any woman to be in a relationship with a guy that couldn't please her.  I've tried all sorts of relationships - with good girls, with bad girls, with girls I love, with girls I don't care about, even some morally unpopular choices - I was doing anything I could try to get a response.  But none of it mattered, and I'd just come home to watch more porn.

I know I've been a disappointment.  I don't want to be.  I want to change.  I'm trying, very hard.  And well, now that you know what the fuck my problem has been, now I'm asking for help.  Nothing specific, I don't even know how you possibly could help, but there will likely be a time in the next couple of months (if I stick with it), where I'm going to need help.

I can't wait to get past this.  I know I'm more than the person I have become.  I'm sooooo much more.  But I can't be that while I'm trapped in this self-imposed prison.  You're right - I want to fly.  But I'm a bird in a cage.  I'm trying to pry the fucking door open with one hand, while my other hand holds it closed.  If I can ever get out of here, watch out world.

You don't need to write back.  We can talk about this when we have lunch.  I don't know how I'm going to be able to look you in the eye at dinner Friday night.  But you wanted to know, and I know I need to tell you, so there it is.  I want to assure you that drugs and alcohol haven't ever been my problem.  Sure, like to drink and smoke pot, but so does everyone.  I don't even do either of those very much anymore.  My problem has always been the PMO addiction cycle.  Please watch the video so you can understand how hard this cycle is to break.

Yesterday, I committed myself to trying again.  I have to keep trying.  I'm the only person that put myself in this situation, so I'm the person that is going to get me out of it.  I can, and I will, I just have to stick with it.

Last night I had a woman in my bed, and I think it is in no small part due to this subreddit. Everybody should quit watching porn and try to masturbate less. But, and this is a big but, there is NO WAY I could do the ninety days. I know that now, after trying and constantly failing. Ninety days without porn, sure, probably did that already, how about this instead--no porn ever again for the rest of your life, makes more sense.
But ninety days without masturbation? OK, if you have ED. If you are a really heavy porn user, wanking off twice a day, seven days a week. Quit cold turkey for ninety days, YES probably a good idea.
But if you're me--I'll tell you what happens after FIVE days.. I go around with a constant erection, feeling excessively tired because I have too little blood pumping in my brain and too much in my penis. I sit on the bus, hear a sexy voice on the seat behind me (just a voice!) and suddenly get so hard I can't go off at my stop, afraid someone would notice. My underpants get full with precum. My balls HURT.
I think this is a great subreddit, but there is a problem. The ideal here--quitting for ninety days--is just not for everyone.
As I said though, cutting down really improves you as a person. Everybody should quit porn completely and set boundaries for how often they can masturbate. (I think only every fourth day works best for me).

Lewis on masturbation,,421,58,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ws4fx/c_s_lewis_on_masturbation/,"For me the real evil of masturbation would be that it takes an appetite which, in lawful use, leads the individual out of himself to complete (and correct) his own personality in that of another (and finally in children and even grandchildren) and turns it back; sends the man back into the prison of himself, there to keep a harem of imaginary brides. And this harem, once admitted, works against his ever getting out and really uniting with a real woman. For the harem is always accessible, always subservient, calls for no sacrifices or adjustments, and can be endowed with erotic and psychological attractions which no woman can rival. Among those shadowy brides he is always adored, always the perfect lover; no demand is made on his unselfishness, no mortification ever imposed on his vanity. In the end, they become merely the medium through which he increasingly adores himself. Do read Charles Williams' *Descent into Hell* and study the character of Mr. Wentworth.

And it not only the faculty of love which is thus sterilized, forced back on itself, but also the faculty of imagination. The true exercise of imagination in my view, is (a) To help us understand other people, (b) To respond to, and, some of us, to produce art. But is has also a bad use: to provide for us, in shadowy form, a substitute for virtues, successes, distinctions, etc. which ought to be sought outside in the real world--e.g., picturing all I'd do if I were rich instead of earning and saving. masturbation involves this abuse of imagination in erotic matters (which I think bad in itself) and thereby encourages a similar abuse of it in all spheres. After all, almost the main work of life is to come out of our selves, out of the little dark prison we are all born in. masturbation is to be avoided as all things are to be avoided which retard this process. The danger is that of coming to love the prison.",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,,True,t3_ws4fx,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ws4fx/c_s_lewis_on_masturbation/,

But most importantly, I’m me.  I’m exactly who im supposed to be. When we fap we put on a mask and we cover up who we truly are and all that potential we have stored inside us just waiting to be unleashed onto the world.  But we sacrifice that gift and ourselves for hours sitting in front of a god damn computer screen fapping to girls we don’t even know.   When we chose to quit we take off that mask and show who we really are.  People have opinions on us.  People aren’t indifferent to us anymore because we put ourselves out there and people actually have opinions on us.  Some people will love us, some will hate us but we don’t give a fuck.  We’re who we are and fuck anyone who tries to stop us.

Fapping is kid’s stuff, we’re men.

I know this was long as hell and I could go on with more, but you get the picture.  Point is I only listed 6 reasons why I should fap.  I listed 54 reasons why I shouldn’t and you shouldn’t either.  I think that explains itself.  So what’s it gonna be? A few seconds of feeling good, or a lifetime of a fucking amazing life and benefits that just never stop? I know my answer, what’s yours? 

Edit: Disclaimer! in one of my reasons i referred to people who fap losers and that im above them in some way shape or form and that offended some people.  This wasnt my intention to make them seem like lesser people than me/us.  I didnt mean to make it sound like im some sort of higher being than them.  But I'll give credit where credit is due and jaspecialk said it best: 

""thought it's the most superficial of all the reasons, no.24 is the one I identify with the most. it just seems so loserly to pretend to have sex while looking at slutty ladies onscreen, who are just products being sold to you by some scummy, greasy, seedy dude raking in the cash""

They're not losers, hell the most successful people in the world might jack off 3 times a day and not be losers at all.  It's just the attitude that comes with it and the image and brand that gets put on people who jerk off on an unhealthy basis could and usually does coincide with the term ""loser"" and when you think about it it doesnt exactly scream champion.  That's one of the reasons i and maybe some of you guys decided to go on this journey is because it did make me feel like a total loser and a scumbag everytime i did it.  I didnt mean to sound like im on some high horse or something and i apologize for sounding rude.

When 28 subjects went on an 8-day NoFap streak, [they received a 45% boost in testosterone on the 7th day](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1631%2Fjzus.2003.0236).

2. When 7 subjects underwent a 3-week NoFap streak, [they had noticeably higher testosterone levels after those 3 weeks](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs003450100222?LI=true)

3. Testosterone has many beneficial qualities:

* [Beneficial effects on well-being and on cardiovascular and diabetes risk profiles](http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/1335979/reload=0;jsessionid=O9bvg9fq4E2HY9kN92Yx.0)

* [A significant increase in hematocrit, a decline in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a sustained increase in serum PSA levels. Placebo treatment led to no significant changes in any of these parameters](http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/75/4/1092.short)

* [An increase in muscle protein synthesis rate](http://jcem.endojournals.org/content/81/10/3469.short)

* [Increased concentration and increased confidence](http://men.webmd.com/features/how-low-testosterone-affects-your-health?page=2)

4\. [Any sort of addiction will mess you up physically, mentally, and emotionally](http://books.google.com/books/about/Addiction_As_an_Attachment_Disorder.html?id=we9VqAYovdoC).

5\. Addiction causes a decrease in dopamine, which [causes social anxiety and depression](http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/cupids-poisoned-arrow/201001/was-the-cowardly-lion-just-masturbating-too-much).

Some additional sources:

* [Dopaminergic challenges in social anxiety disorder: evidence for dopamine D3 desensitisation following successful treatment with serotonergic antidepressants](http://jop.sagepub.com/content/24/5/709.abstract)

* [Low Dopamine D2 Receptor Binding Potential in Social Phobia](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/article.aspx?articleID=174018)

* [Biologic measures of dopamine system hypoactivity have been linked to social anxiety disorder, trait detachment, and general deficits in reward and incentive function](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2002-08345-007)

6\. [Willpower is a resource that can be trained to get stronger](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10457761)

* [Additional source](http://www.npr.org/2011/09/18/140516974/resistance-training-for-your-willpower-muscles)

7\. ""NoFap is nothing more than a placebo!!!!""

Placebos work by increasing dopamine levels. [[1]](http://www.scienceguide.nl/201210/dopamine,-the-key-to-placebo-success.aspx) [[2]](http://tauruspet.med.yale.edu/staff/edm42/papers/journal-club/Effects%20of%20expectation%20on%20placebo-induced%20da%20release%20in%20pd.pdf) [[3]](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=210854) [[4]](http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/01/the-placebo-phenomenon)

Thus, 1) if the intended effect of NoFap is an increase in dopamine, then it cannot be considered a placebo, and 2) placebos have absolutely no effect on your testosterone levels; those benefits *cannot* be linked to a placebo.

* Increased diligence at work
* Increased social interaction (with girls, guys, old ladies, homeless dudes, babies!)
* 36 and counting straight days of running and lifting
* Pushing myself to do things that previously made me uncomfortable
* Appreciating life and taking things as they come

Since I started taking NoFap seriously in early November, I made a vow that I would not cut the hair on my face or head until I felt I had conquered my addiction. I now have an epic four-month-old beard and sweep my long hair out of my eyes. It is a constant reminder of my struggle. Jealous guys give me shit and call me a hobo, a terrorist, etc. I couldn't care less because my confidence level is at 9000 fng (fucks not given). 

On Friday, I went to a bar with a group of friends. One of my friends (let's call her Britney) had brought a friend (let's call her Anna) from out of town that was visiting the area for the weekend. Anna would normally be a girl I would be too afraid to talk because of how attractive she is or because I would be worried of what Britney might think, but I no longer have such stupid thoughts any more. I flirted with her hard and I could tell she was into it.

On Saturday, I went to a party because Britney and Anna told me they were going. I made my move and took Anna home the night of day 28/morning of day 29. [The sex was crazy.](/nsfw) I made her breakfast the next morning. Britney came to pick her up and was so flabbergasted she could barely speak to me.

On Sunday, I got a call from Anna inviting me over for dinner. We double dated with Britney and her boyfriend. I took Anna home again. [I only got 2 hours of sleep sandwiched between many more hours of sex!](/nsfw)

On Monday morning, Anna left to fly back home. She practically begged me to come and visit her soon.

On Monday night, my best friend invited me over for dinner. Word had already gotten around. At one point he went to use the bathroom, and his girlfriend came up to me and said ""You have become the biggest player in the department. Girls are swarming over you"" while playfully touching my shoulder!

Ladies and gentlemen, the results I am seeing are insane, more than I could have ever imagined possible. All of this because I now grab life by the balls instead of diddling with my own. You can do it too.

Now, he is like an animal. Foreplay is amazing. He did my favorite role play last night. He gets turned on and loves turning me on. I've never had so much attention! He's even gotten a bit more outgoing.


We've had sex nearly every night and he's gotten much more creative with it. This was his decision - I didn't pressure him into it. The thing is... I notice more girls checking him out! Just makes me proud to be with him. He pays more attention to me. He's kept me updated willingly because he seems quite proud of his accomplishment.

Until a month ago, I was the typical average Joe in regards of Porn and Fap: Addicted to internet porn, I was consuming it at least once a day and, of course, fapping every day. Average good looking guy, single, 30 years old, good job. When I was motivated, I could have a great deal of success with women.  The key words here are: ""when I was motivated"".  

Frankly, I had no idea of the effects of mass porn on me.  Then I found nofap on reddit.  Read it all.  Read it again.  And start a nofap / noporn month.  After 30 days, the consequences are so great that I have to share them with you. 

I have to say that my objective was the following: Nofap noporn, but if I met a girl, I would go along with sex.  

First fews days were awful (I thought at that time).  I felt pressure in my body and my mind.  Already a big ""sex thinker"", sex was in my every thoughts.  Work was hard.  I had difficulties concentrating on anything else.  I almost felt like a sex predator when I was walking in the streets: every girls I saw was a potential date.  It had to be: it was now the only option.  And ""it"" began.

After 5 or 6 days, I realized that the pressure I felt was not something bad: It was energy.  It was motivation - not only sexual, put pure genuine everyday's life motivation.  I felt that every beautiful girl I saw was in my range.  Buying a bottle at a wine shop, I decided to give my opinion about a wine a girl was holding in her hand, something I wouldn't normally do.  Guess what, it ended up with a phone number.

My eye contacts with girls was sharp. Smiling to them became normal.  The day after in the subway, I smiled at a beautiful tall darkhair girl.  She came to see me, asking me where I studied.  She appartently saw me at University few years ago.  I standed straight before her, smiling, making jokes.  Always looking at her, I felt she was somehow interested, touching my arm, brushing her breast ""accidently"" on my arms, signs that don't lie.  Guess what: Phone number.

On friday I went to a bar with 3 friends.  I saw a superb Lebanese girl with the dream shape.  Again, eye contact, smile, confidence.  But this time, instead of letting her go - what guys almost always do - I went to her and told her that I liked how she was dressed, that she had a lot of style.  Short discussion.  Guess what: phone number.

On sunday (7 days without porn / fap ) I went for a coffee with a old ""flame"" from college.  2 hours later, we were in my bedroom.  I won't go into details, but it was the most amazing sex I ever had in my life.  At first I feared I would come in seconds.  It didn't happen.  On the contrary, I was in total control with a non stop incredible erection.  Then the orgasm came.  The longest most powerful thing I've never experienced.  I think it lasted 30 seconds. And the erection was not gone.  I have to say - and this not bragging - my friend was very impressed.  Me even more than her.

It now has been 30 days with no fap / porn and I've never felt more confident in my life.  And the results are there.  All this is not theoretical.  I met more girls in the last month that in the last year and you know why ?  Because it's the only option. Because I now know I have nothing to loose.

Bottom line: Guys: Stop wasting your sexual energy on porn and fap.  You just can't imagine what's hidding behind it.  Most girls will confirm the following principle: they prefer confidence and humor than appearence.  You think you're not sexy enough to experience what I just did ?  You - are - wrong.  Try it.  It is in you.  Now I know it.

So instead of spending nights on youporn, you go outside and experience things about yourself you didn't think possible.

From a guy who is so thankful of the nofap reddit page that he had to share the good news.

It doesn't matter when, where, how, we want more than just comfort, we want excitement.

What people don't realise is that this can't work out permanently. Sooner or later you'll just get used to that constant state of excitement, which won't feel like real excitement anymore.
Even worse is that normal things will seem like a pest to you.

The good news? Your brains is dynamic. You can rewire it.
I'm sure you have a lot of pleasure you don't actually need.

For example, I used to drink a lot of sugary drinks. This is plain stupid.
I didn't even like to drink water, the most natural thing on earth. This is not normal.
Sugary drinks are not only unnecessary, but they are very unhealthy, can cause diabetes, caries, and other diseases.
It's just another unhealthy habit, get rid of it!

Another thing is music. I've played the guitar for 10 years now. I love it and it has been a great part of my life ever since. BUT. Music is another source of pleasure. I used to get out my iPod when I went to work,
at work (I'm in IT, programming, so basically I could listen to it the whole day), when I went home, and at home. 
You'll eventually get to the point where you can't even enjoy it anymore. It will become an unspectacular part of your day. I've learned that I can enjoy a lot more since I've stopped listening to it as much.

My last example, hot showers.
I used to hate cold showers, like most people do, because they may be uncomfortable.
We try to escape any discomfort. Now I love them!
They can improve your mood, they can boost your immune system, they can make you feel like a man.
More advantages can be better skin, better circulatory system, thicker hair, and many many more.
They can also help you with Nofap, they will most probably kill your urges, because you have to use your energy to get your body temperature back up. Also, I'm talking about ice cold, as cold as possible.

Does this all sound familiar?
Porn? Masturbation? Unnecessary pleasure?

You see, our lives are full of poison, it may be food, the internet, sex, whatever, for you.
They're all generally good things, but they are addictive. Your mind needs to be stronger than your body.

Thankfully, I haven't relapsed and others claim that these pictures aren't tempting, but not everyone here is as fortunate. The titles of your posts only attract more attention to things that we don't need to know about.

Get it together already. 

**Edit:** For all you sarcastic people out there, let me clarify. I'm not complaining about people who actually write up a decent post about how they overcame their urges. 

The point of this post was to ensure the supportive nature of this subreddit. Posts that go ""Man, that album of those sexy girls in that subreddit right over there is REALLY annoying"" are not supportive at all, especially when the post is a link to a useless gif. 

I'm also not defending those who actually went and looked for the pictures and then masturbated to them. If you did that, the responsibility definitely still falls on you. But we should be careful about what we post, considering what /r/NoFap is for. Just because there's porn everywhere on the internet doesn't mean we can disregard what type of content we submit here. 

Same thing with AA. Just because there are bars and alcohol everywhere in the world doesn't mean you can show up with a six pack of beer to an AA meeting.

Because I can't remember the last time I achieved a goal without compromising it or watering it down. I'm so fucking proud of myself.

**--My Nofap Background--**

Fapped since I was 13. Always hated how guilty it made me feel. I wanted to quit as soon as I started, but for 5 years (that's 1825 days at least) I have not been able to go longer than a week. I tried everything, I told close friends, I installed software, I even told my dad at one point. But always, my addiction was stronger than those bonds of trust, and by breaking them I was retreating into the secrecy and isolation that addiction thrives on. 





**--How I broke the cycle--**

I knew this time would be different from the start. I felt differently about it. What worked for me was that nofap encourages you to aspire to an ideal, to become the human being that you should be. To live by your principles and your morals and be the kind of man who stands up for what is right and does so by making himself an example for other people to follow. THAT is the quality called leadership, that is the stuff the legends of the human race (gandhi, Churchill, Jesus, Muhammad, Mandela) are made of. Every inspirational speech you've ever heard is based solely on this idea - to aspire to be a human being made of principle, not one who sells themselves out for gain or pleasure. 

This is what drove me to beat the addiction - because I believed in it 100%. Despite all of this, I had urges. Some of them I nearly gave in to. In these moments, if I was not telling myself to live up to my principles, I was telling myself these exact words. *""You have worked far too hard to get to this point to piss it all away now.""* And it was true. Find something that you really believe in and use it to your advantage. If I can reach 90 days, literally anyone can. 





**--The benefits--**

First off, not all these benefits will be due to nofap alone, but nofap is the catalyst for changing your life. Instead of shame, I feel pride. Instead of guilt about the past, I feel determination about the future. I won't get everything right, but at least I will try. I was so scared of offending girls that I wouldn't even tell them I liked them. In fact, I've found that people find it much easier to relate to you and respect you if you make no apologies for being yourself, even when you get things wrong. Even if they don't fancy you, they'll respect the fuck out of you for having the balls to talk to them.

There's also been physical benefits. My penis felt different around day 25, it's more turgid, less ""flabby"". I can get erections by thinking about real-life girls that I like, but I've yet to get one from merely looking at a girl. 

I also have more time, and a better can-do attitude about things. I get the cleaning done, I have cooking as a new hobby, and if I can't get out with my friends I get out alone, and do stuff.





**--Bad things, and things that didn't happen--**

First thing, I nearly went mad with trying to improve myself. It got to the point of obssession. As much as we're trying to be better, we have to happy when we don't meet our high standards. Learn to be happy with losing before you learn to be happy with winning. Success is great, but trying and learning from your mistakes is better. Just don't take liberties when giving yourself leeway for failure.

I didn't get superpowers. I doubt their existence. I had moments of social awkwardness and awesomeness before, and I have them in pretty much the same frequency now. During my 90 days, I managed to make a girl give me her number because she felt sorry for me, accidentally take advantage of a drunk friend (by kissing her, thanks to lilychaud for demanding clarification) because I didn't realise how drunk she was, and then embarrass myself by telling her and finding out she had no recollection of it, and didn't like me in that way, and fail to ask a girl I really like out in our last week of term. But hey, I also managed to get chatted up by a girl who approached me at the airport, learn some important life lessons about confidence and save that friendship I nearly ruined. Basically what I'm trying to say is your life will be whatever you make it. Make it good.





**--My tips--**

* You edge, you reset your counter. You're trying to change your life, and you want to do it half-assed!? You're only harming yourself here.

* Learn to be happy with losing. If you tried, you did well. Don't go insane trying to be perfect, improvement is a gradual process.

* Never give up. Even now, the journey doesn't stop for me. I've got a beautiful girl to ask out when I go back to university and a lot of fun to have from now until then.

Due to a set of circumstances and personal experiences, I now know it is something MUCH greater. Read this to develop the ultimate self confidence.",ChlorellaMan,446,111,120,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/18mz8f/for_over_the_past_year_nofap_was_all_about/,"Hey everyone! This is a throwaway account of mine because I point a lot of friends of mine towards NoFap to get on board with everything we're doing here, and for this post, I'd like to remain anonymous. 

As the title suggests, I've been going on and off NoFap for over a year now. My longest period of No PMO was about 5 months, but this was when I first discovered yourbrainonporn/nofap, and I wasn't nearly as forward thinking as I am now. I've currently been 100% No PMO for about the past 2 and a half months. I'm feeling great, as expected... but there's some things I'd like to address..

I've been focusing A LOT lately on becoming more confident, getting rid of my social anxiety, being dominant, becoming the alpha male, picking up chicks, and everything else in this category. I've come to the realization that I always look for validation everywhere I go. Not by impressing people, but rather, I always look around myself to see which women are checking me out. If I get checked out, ego boost. If I don't, ego crash. This is NOT the right approach to confidence ladies and gentlemen! 

I've been focusing a lot on my body language, vocal intonations, and everything else that is aimed towards the characteristic of being dominant... Until last night. 

A series of circumstances and experiences shed MASSIVE amounts of light on this situation for me. I've been stressing in particular about this whole ""becoming alpha"" thing A LOT these past 2 weeks. I, and most likely most of you, have been approaching this ALL wrong. 

I've read about ""sexual transmutation"" plenty of times on here and other places. It's where you transmute, or ""transform"", sexual energy into productive energy towards self improvement and success. It really didn't hit me how powerful this process is until tonight.. It was further compounded when I read the full chapter on sexual transmutation by Napoleon Hill in ""Think and Grow Rich"" which is a MUST READ if you want to take things to the next level in your life.. You can read it here : http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm (It's a bit of a long read, but SO worth it.) 

Anyways, I've come to the realization that I've been approaching this all wrong. I've been focusing on the women and social status power aspect of things to further me.. This is NOT the way to do it!! 

Instead, stop looking for random hook ups and fuck sessions with women! Firmly declare in your mind that you will not have sex, or any kind of sexual relations, with a woman unless she is your girlfriend. Also firmly declare that you will NOT make a woman your girlfriend unless you and her connect 100% and are POSITIVE that she's the one for you during this period of your life. DO NOT just date a giarl because she's attractive, popular, or something else. A girl that you date for those superficial qualities will not bring you what you need in your life at this time to advance you to your next stage. You need a woman (or a boyfriend, if you're female/gay), that shares the same interests, that you vibe with COMPLETELY, and that you are absolutely 100% comfortable with.

I noticed that whenever I hook up with a really attractive woman of high social status, my confidence is boosted MASSIVELY the next couple of days.

Here's where the secret to all of this comes in : 

1.) If you're not staring at every woman that you see - because you find her attractive and want to fuck her - your confidence is going to naturally shoot EXTREMELY high, because you're no longer trying to impress anyone or look for validation. It doesn't matter how hot she is, or how nice her ass is, or how much cleavage she's showing.. You've already declared in your mind that you will not have sex with ANY of these women, and you mean it. They are COMPLETELY off the list as far as sexual relations goes. After that initial social pressure of trying to attract a mate is gone, you can be yourself COMPLETELY, because it doesn't matter what they think of you, whether they like you or not after that. 

2.) When you DO finally get an amazing girlfriend that is PERFECT for you, you will ALSO have that massive amounts of confidence. Just as I said before, when I hook up with a very pretty girl, or a girl I like a lot, or a girl that has high social status, I feel extremely confident because I have become ""validated"" in their eyes.. I was worthy. When you have an awesome girlfriend, you have this all the time. You are validated with her. She is yours, you are hers.. Nothing else. 

In short, this method leads to MAXIMUM AMOUNTS OF CONFIDENCE, and the 100% EXPRESSION OF YOUR TRUE SELF at ALL TIMES, for THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. 

You will no longer be looking to impress girls. The one girl that you click with 100% that you don't HAVE to try to impress, will eventually be your girlfriend. It all works out. It's all a ""spiritual"" puzzle, if you will, and these are the pieces required to develop the most confidence a human being can attain. 

Keep in mind.. When you stop paying attention to girls because you will not be sexual with them, THEY will start eyeballing you like a piece of meat. THEY will want validation from you because they see that they don't phase you. Your head will not be turning and checking them out, or looking to see if they notice you.. DO NOT let this new found women-magnetism of yours lead you to try to indulge in sexual behavior, or you will end up right back at the bottom of the pit.

LAST BUT NOT LEAST - you must TRANSMUTE the sexual energy. Don't just refrain from sex or gawking at women. Actually USE this new energy to make yourself successful, knowledgeable, wise, and every other good quality you could attain. The ""Think and Grow Rich"" chapter I posted above will describe in more detail how to do this..

**TL;DR: There is no TLDR. You must read the whole thing. If you don't, you will most likely continue suffering from an inferiority complex, grasping at every empty sexual encounter you can get your hands on. Read the whole thing, and THINK about it. Those that are ready to receive this will understand it. Those who aren't ready, will downvote it, and eventually find it a later date :)**

He told me that he put down a pretty serious alcohol addiction about three years ago, and that in hindsight, the addiction was one of the best things that happened to him. 
Why?
Because it gave him a clear-cut negative aspect of his life to conquer, and when he did conquer it, he came out on the other side miles ahead of everyone else who never had that struggle. He was hooked, he was weak, but he bested himself and that instilled a sense of success and triumph in his life.

Others have the good fortune of never experiencing an addiction in their life; they have their shit together. But those who are addicted live in a state of chaos. Their spirits are weak. But an addiction gives you the chance to rise above yourself; it gives you the chance to push forward. And when you come out on top, you will be a champion amongst common men.

My fellow Fapstronauts, accept the challenge life has thrown at you. Do not back down from your 90-day challenges. I'm at day 7, and I will hustle to break my chains. Rise!

1364394377.0,336,self.NoFap,1b402j,I'm a 23 year old porn addict. I just discovered I have ED after sleeping with a beautiful girl.,towonderland,387,51,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1b402j/im_a_23_year_old_porn_addict_i_just_discovered_i/,"I started masturbating when I was 10. I was really computer savvy since I was a little kid and I quickly discovered how internet porn worked.

When I was 12 I had an experience of cuddling/dry humping with a female friend. This turned me on like crazy and I became obsessed with the feeling of sexual pleasure.

I grew up through private Catholic schools, where masturbation was a ""sin"" and that porn was ""wrong."" This didn't resonate with me. In fact, religion didn't resonate with me at all. I felt like masturbation was a healthy stress-reliever. Masturbation felt good, and porn helped me feel good. This had been my attitude for the last 12 or so years.

The extent of my addiction wasn't apparent to me until 3 days ago, but now I feel like I understand everything clearly. I know what I need to do.

I masturbated a lot to porn. I would find different scenes and images and things that turned me on in the right way. My masturbation technique is a little odd as well, I swish my right palm on the head of my penis, while holding it steady with my left hand. (as the head is the most sensitive spot, I think I am worried about having done permanent sensitivity damage from years of this--I haven't heard of of anybody who masturbates like this so idk if there's anybody out there who can relate and tell me if this was damaging).

Throughout my teens I felt the affects of becoming more isolated, becoming obsessed with the opposite sex, and being slightly depressed. I watched as my friends had numerous relationships and various successes. These things didn't happen to me. When the opportunity for these things arose, I would become nervous and not be myself.

This continued throughout college. I gave up on relationships about halfway through college, sort of accepting my fate. I graduated college at 21.

Throughout all of these years I masturbated probably 10 times a week. Some days as many as 4 times. I never stopped really; when I went on trips I would maybe stop for a couple days at most and then go right back to it. I would experiment -- I have come anally at least 10-15 times in my life, the first time of which felt incredible because I hadn't experienced pleasure like that before. I would say on a straight-gay spectrum I'm about 15% gay and 85% straight. I don't think I could have a relationship with a man to be honest but I can find them attractive sometimes.

Recently I met this beautiful girl whom I had strong feelings for. I wanted to become lovers. I felt this strong attraction. We ended up staying at a hotel for 2 nights and getting really comfortable with each other.

We ended up cuddling and I was rock hard at first, but eventually it got really soft. I loved the feeling of her against me, but I was surprised I wasn't hard the entire time.

We cuddled for a really, really long time and eventually things got further along. I remember when I was kissing her on the lips for the first time and she was laying on top of me, I realized I wasn't hard at all. I felt dizzy and conflicted when I got up later and realized I wasn't hard when kissing the most beautiful girl I had known.

Later on, we were cuddling more and things got a little bit more sexual-- we were feeling each other's privates and I realized I could not get it up at all. I was completely baffled by this point.

From years of my internet porn use I thought that I had a huge libido, and the size of my erection is rather gifted so I felt like I was set for any girl who would want to have me. I craved becoming a lover + satisfying women. I felt confident about it before this experience.

I went to the bathroom and tried to masturbate to get to a full erection. I could seriously not do it. It would get to like 45% at most and quickly die. I eventually returned to the bed feeling the irony of obsessing over sex and women for a decade and here I was with this beautiful girl right in front of me and I couldn't feel anything down there.

That was 3 days ago. I haven't gotten an erection since. I decided on my way home that I would not look at porn ever again. I got online and googled for ED in young men. I found this and yourbrainonporn. Reading some of the other people's testimonies on this clicked in my head. I feel awake and alive now. I feel like (some) of my social anxiety and depression is due to my porn addiction. I didn't even realize how much harm I was causing to my body. I have absolutely no idea how long it is going to take to become cured of this (if ever). I only hope I haven't done permanent damage.

That said I feel pretty good that I realized I had this issue. I'm glad I wasn't drunk/high or anything when I was with this girl because then I might have blamed the problem on that. 

I want to see this girl again but as the relationship is a long-distance thing, it might be awhile. I feel actually pretty good about that because it will give me some time to heal. Next time I see her I won't obsess over doing sexual things at all. We will cuddle and talk and hold eachother and rub our noses together and kiss.

I haven't yet told her about this realization but I will at the first opportunity. If she things I am too much baggage (long distance relationship w/ sexual issues) then I am perfectly OK with that + I will thank her for making me become aware of my problem.

If she still wants to be with me, I will be happy. But I will explain this all to her the best I can.

1338212208.0,327,self.NoFap,u8odj,A tip I learned from my neuroscience professor has really helped me.,,386,59,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/u8odj/a_tip_i_learned_from_my_neuroscience_professor/,"So I've been trying to do nofap for a long time. My strategy up until now, among other things was simply to attempt to not think about PMO at all. Well this strategy has not worked. First off, to simply erase a thought from your mind is impossible. Secondly, when you constantly are trying to avoid a thought about a certain action (PMO) I think this subconsciously tells your brain that this action(PMO) is desirable.

So here is what I have learned. A couple weeks ago my neuroscience professor was giving a lecture on the emotion controlling parts of the brain. He mentioned that an effective way to change an unwanted behavior is to associate that behavior with a  certain emotion, either positive or negative depending on what your goal is. 

This brings me back to my current streak of 8 days, by far the easiest 8 days of nofap I have ever done. My strategy has been this: every time a thought of PMO enters my head I immediately picture myself having just fapped, with my pants around my ankles feeling the regret and sadness I always feel at such times.

 After 8 days of doing this, porn has seemed to lost a lot of its allure. Now whenever thoughts of watching porn pop into my head instead of telling myself ""no, you will not do that!"" I find myself thinking ""Why the hell would I even want to to do that if its going to make me feel so bad?"" Try this one out guys, it really helps.

**How it started** 
   The first time I viewed porn was at the age of four. My parents were in the kitchen cooking breakfast, so I got up from my room to look around the new apartment. I went into their room, and discovered a porn magazine under the bed. For a week straight I went to look at that same magazine. I stopped looking at it when my father caught me, and told me to stop. 

   I didn't see porn again till age 6. I asked my mom to find a Power Rangers movie among unmarked VHS. She found it, but not before accidentally putting in a porno for a few seconds. 

   My porn addiction truly began one night in 2006. My family just purchased HBO. I fell asleep round 9:30 and woke up to the moans Rebecca Love's Ghost in a Teeny Bikini around 1 A.M. The next thing I know I had the biggest erection of my life and then I ejaculated. 

   This led me to streaming GGW previews for a few months until I downloaded Limewire. I remember masturbating to a GGW dorm video before school for months. 
 
   At 14 (2008) I received a new computer than could run anything I wanted to watch. I began to visit multiple websites daily. At first it was boy/girl &amp; girl/girl and within a year I was reading hentai and incest comics. 

   By May 2012 I was watching 1-2 hours of porn a day, and masturbating 1-3 times a day.

**What I caused on myself**
     My addiction caused me to be extremely lethargic and introverted. Making eye contact while speaking became a challenge and spending all day playing CoD4/WoW was my life. I'd get home at 2:30 and wouldn't say a word to any one. My grades began to go down hill. I once was a straight A student, but between 8th-11th grade I failed 10 classes. I had no social life. Any time I got around people I would just feel awkward and self self conscious. I also went through a bout of depression in Aug. 2010 - Dec. 2010 and gained 30 pounds. 

**How I found NoFap**
   I used to post heavily on a music forum, and on the night of May 16th one of my favorite posters posted the Gary Wilson video. I hopped out of my bed and watched in amazement. I felt like that man was talking about me directly to me. Since it was about to be 12 I couldn't find a reason to not start the next day. I mean I had nothing to lose. The worst was me going 90 days without PMO.

**How I didn't relaspe**
   In the first 90 days I just read NoFap/YBOP daily. Reading success stories along with knowing how I was before kept me from wanting to go back. I also didn't set a unreachable goal. I never said to myself I'll do a year. I just kept adding 90 days.

**How I changed** 
   I wake up every day happy to see a new day. I know I don't have this black cloud over me now. I'm much more confident. I can walk with my head up, hold a conversation, and make eye contact. I'm more calm, friendly, and open now. I can see a problem and think about how to solve it instead of running away from it.

   I workout 7 days a week now. The feeling is great, and going to sleep accomplished feel wonderful. I actually got straight A's this and last semester for the first time since 5th grade. I actually read now. I've read eight books since the start on my journey! I actually have emotions now. My friend's senior letter to me had me holding back tears.

   I still try to go church just to see other view points. There is no more brain fog either. My erections and stronger in the morning, and my voice is deeper. I also stopped using soap.

   The most important change was me learning to love and accept myself. Sure I'm 5'5 and sweat even when I'm cold, but that's just who I am. There's no sense of crying over something I can't change.

**O-0**
I'm still a kissless virgin, but I'm no longer ashamed about it. Last year I would have chocked up just typing that. 

**Thanks**

I just need to vent and hope you can hear me out. 

 As you can see, I'm on day 37 (approx.). The longest I've ever gone in my entire life. I've been going pretty strong, but I'm very sexually frustrated. I consider myself a pretty attractive guy in his 20s, I work a good-paying programming job, I'm musically talented and such, etc. (Not trying to brag). But I for the LIFE of me can't seem to get laid. I go to clubs, parties, hangouts with friends, and I've been much more alpha and confident lately with girls but I can't seem the get the RELEASE I seek so badly, when I want it..

 It then hit me.. This goes beyond NoFap. This is a life lesson. I have to learn to be cool with not being in control all the time, and sometimes not getting what I want, when I want it. You see, fapping breeds this selfish and spoiled entitled attitude that when you want something, you need to have it satisfied NOW. If I'm horny, easy, just jack off. But you see, that's the easy way out. You become an apathetic piece of shit who can't work hard for anything meaningful in life.

I've read many posts about married people here, and it's crazy to think that even when you're married, you can't always get Sex when and where you want it. Let alone being a single guy trying to hookup with other girls. That's just life, and it can be applied to anything else. Somethings are just NOT in your control and we have to accept it. I recently learned that Life (and everything else) is like a roller coaster. Once you are strapped in, and the coaster is moving, there is absolutely NOTHING you can do to stop it from going it's path. You can flail your arms in fear, scream, and cry, OR you can sit back and enjoy the ride.

What IS in our control? Well, we can control ourselves to not fap, groom ourselves nicely, workout, we can control our habits, go out become successful, make something of ourselves, but that doesn't guaranteed you'll get laid WHEN and WHERE you want it. We have to accept the fact that real women are not objects to be there at our whim. That we have to actually get our shit together as men to be the men women want. 

 I really just want to FUCK some girl right now, but it's probably not gonna happen tonight. Will it happen in the near future? Most definitely. I know it will. I can't control when and where like I used to with fapping, But right now, I CAN and need to control my desires and just accept the fact that there are just some things that are out of my control.

Eckhart Tolle once said something along the lines ""The moment you accept the fact that you are not at peace, then will you be at peace.""

Think on that for a second..
Anyways guys, I'm not the best writer but thanks for hearing my frustrated thoughts and rant. I'm staying strong on all your support. Keep going brothers and sisters.

But . . .,time2change76,393,68,92,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hwcz2/nofap_makes_women_more_beautiful_but/,"... beautiful in a much deeper meaning.  I see more clearly who women are.  They are so much more beautiful if you think of them more than just something you want to have sex with.  Look at their faces and the wonderful way they communicate with you in so many non-verbal ways.  Women light up all of my senses.  They are experts in communication I have lacked in so much of my shy and anxious life.  Porn perverts so much more about how truly wonderful and beautiful women are.

Look at the beautiful women, talk and laugh with them, understand who they are.  When you know how beautiful they are, you will find one you can't live without.  When you have your one, marry her, and never let her go.  Tell her how much you love her every day.

I have my one, and we have made three, beautiful daughters that I hope find men that love them for who they are.  Women are more beautiful these days for me, but my wife the most gorgeous women I have ever seen .  She lights my life in so many ways, and I can't wait to get home to see her.  Porn only disappoints, while my wife keeps expanding my desires to levels I didn't know I had a month ago.  Not only sexually, but desires in other ways I can't describe in words.

Keep moving forward my friends, I think life just gets more beautiful from here.  It has for me.  Thank you for your support.

Just noticed this as I reset the countdown timer on my laptop for 90 days again this morning. I had a streak of 3 weeks going and lost it in one moment of weakness, but now I know that trigger. This time around I want to beat the chaser effect and not waste a week in between streaks like I have in the past. 

How awesome would it be to wake up on Christmas morning and be at 90 days?! We could maybe post ideas of how we could reward ourselves with a special gift or something that morning. Or maybe that is just retarded. Ideas?

**EDIT:** Wow, this was way more popular than I thought it would be. Here is how it will work. I don't have time to sort through PM's from all of you everyday, so ONLY SEND ME A MESSAGE IF YOU RELAPSE. I will otherwise assume that you are going strong. Each week, probably on Monday evenings, I will post an update thread noting who is still on the train and who has fallen. I've noticed that some people would like to have accountability, but that strikes me as a more personal thing that people can figure out on their own. It seems likely though that there will be several people in this challenge who want something like that, so just talk amongst yourselves. Here is the list so far; If I forgot you, or added you by mistake, just message me.

**EDIT 2:** Alright, closing it up now as we have 100 of participants, and I don't want this to get to out of hand for me to manage. Best of luck to everyone participating, and don't forget to **encourage one another!** Together we can do this, and have a great start to not only the next year, but the rest of our lives!! If there is further interest, perhaps more people can start another Christmas Challenge, and we can compete against one another. Whoever has the most participants standing at the end gets a widget or something.

**EDIT 3:** There is now a second group that is starting and is being run by eleventhzepplin. Many thanks to him for doing this, as I simply couldn't handle everybody. If you are interested, please go over and check out his thread, and I apologize to anyone I was not able to accommodate here. Here is the link: http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/10ixn8/second_christmas_challenge_group/ And now there is also a 3rd group! This is fantastic!!

I'm curious why some fapstronauts rationalize edging as not fapping. That makes no sense--what's the difference  between the two, besides that fapping mostly leads to ""O""? Nothing...

EDGING IS 100% FAPPING. BASICALLY EVERYTHING IN THEM IS THE SAME.

We need to quit trying to hide the actions we feel GUILTY about from ourselves through rationalizing. By rationalizing, we will only continue (in this case) to do PMO, or any combination of that. 

So if any of us does ANY degree of PMO, or whatever our individual  restrictions may be, if any of us does that for even one second, ONE SECOND, we start over. 

Oh, looked at ""P"" for ""only"" a minute? Back to Square one. Reset badge. Happy face with ""1 day"" again. That's how we move through. 

What we ultimately get from NoFap is not a high Day Counter or Badge, it is what we LEARN from a result. That means a Day 1'er could have gotten much more out of NoFap than a Day 90'er. 

Best of luck, good men.

We have been together for a while, possibly ten years now. We have grown fond of each other, and I want to tell you that, even though I admire you, you are beginning to get on my nerves a bit.



Yes, I said it. I admire you. You get to be with the kind of girls I fantasize about and you don't let me touch them or know them, just see them through your cameras. How the fuck do you do that? And why are you so cruel? If you were a true friend, you would surely give me a call and say ""hey mate, great ladies at this party, come around"". But no, you take a video and you show them to me, to rub it in my face that you get to know them and that I need to be content with the second hand smoke of sexuality. That is not nice on your part.



Besides, I know how you get those girls. You fucking pay them! That is not the type of friends I wanna have, you know. I do respect men who manage to get the hotties in their own merit. What is that of paying them? And then you show them to me as if it is something special? Man, you must be kidding me...



Also, you know what gets on my nerves? You don't treat me right. There, I said it. You basically want me there, in front on my fucking screen, fantasizing about what I will never get to have, getting familiar with my dick as I zone out into nothingness, thinking ""wouldn't it be wonderful if I could be with that goddess?"" ""I will never be able to meet someone as hot as her"" ""why don't I get to know and experience that type of sex""...



You know what? Fuck you. Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you. You manipulative cunt. I do get to know hotties, and have amazing sex, but you know what, they are REAL women. They do not follow a script. They do as they please, and they do not charge me. The problem is that every minute I spend with your fucking bullshit, it is a minute I am not employing in my business or with my REAL women. I am fucking wasting my amazing life away with you.



Besides... every minute I spend with you I am more miserable. I stop believing in reality and I miss your faked, silicone-driven, fantasy-filled scripted girls. Which is as idiotic as watching a Star Trek movie and feeling that I am missing something because I am not a crew member of the Enterprise. You, youuuu, you... you make me confused about what is real.



Fuck you, idiot. I will get my own hotties. I bet they are fucking way more interesting than yours. I am sure they will tell me about their lives, their feelings, their struggles, their sexuality. I am sure they fart and can laugh about it. I am sure of it because I have known enough women already, and somehow nobody is enough because I let you trick me into believing that women are something else. Something beyond human, something to cater to my fantasies, fed by you, manipulative tyrant bastard.



I am done with you. I hate you. I gave away my fucking freedom to you. I gave you the key to define my sexual desires and expectations. I gave you permission to walk uninterrupted in my beliefs about relationships. I let you paint a picture of femininity and I ran by it. I gave you more authority over me that I ever gave my parents, my teachers, or my lovers... people who actually loved me.



Get the fuck away. You want to make your money by hacking into my brain and the brains of my fellow men. You want the men of the world to be chronic masturbators, always dissatisfied. You want women of the world to feel frustrated because their men prefer 2D pixelated silicon than their real selves. You want those women to feel that they are not enough. You want women to believe that all a man wants is a pair of boobs.



You know what? Even if that is true. Even if sometimes I just want to squeeze a good pair of boobs and chew those nipples to the point of ecstasy... Fuck you. Any real pair of boobs is miles away from your 2D unreal ones. Any real woman is worth a thousand of your tricks.



I will never, never look back in time and remember ""oh, that porn video, remember specifically THAT one? Oh that was memorable..."" But I can remember every real woman I have ever been with. Even the bad crazy bitchy stupid ones. Even the ones I didn't love, I remember THEM. They were R E A L.



So fuck you very much and get away, you tyrant, manipulative, abusive, immoral fucker. I am done with you and I hate you for all the hours I have wasted dancing to your fucking song.



I hope you fucking die alone, old, and sick with all the money in the world, masturbating to your HD screen and a box of viagra, with nobody with you in bed, not knowing what to do with the love you never had.



I really, really, really fucking hate you, former master. I was your slave for way too many years. I am gonna wait until my REAL girlfriend is back from holidays and I am gonna fuck her to oblivion in your honor. And with each orgasm I hope you feel more, and more, and more alone.



You have done nothing for men in this fucking world, nor you have done much for women. You should be sitting in the electric chair, with the wires attached to your dick, and a hottie with a good pair of silicon boobs a g-string connecting the wire to the plug as your balls fry. There. For all the sperm wasted in your name. Burn, motherfucker. Burn.

this is my first post and I've gone 44 days without PMO. Like most people I started watching porn at the age of 13 or 14. Since then, I've watched porn many times a week, sometimes masturbating several times a day.

Today it's my 21st birthday. My social anxiety forced me to stay at my college dormitory most of the time and even when some social event came up, I turned it down, saying ""Sorry, I got to study, exams coming up soon"". But I never studied, I was lying to the people and to myself, I was looking forward to the prospect of me being alone at the dorm and I just fapped to porn till I had enough. And even if I went to a social event, my social anxiety blocked my speech and I was unable to make the first contact, especially to the girls. I'm 21 years old now and I've never had a girlfriend, I tried but several times I was rejected which caused my low self-esteem. Because of masturbation I even rejected two girls who showed an interest in me. I started ignoring them and eventually lost them. I regret my past behavior and I have to accept the consequences. My behavior was foolish and pathetic. Since then a lot has changed - I’ve been 44 days free.

**MY JOURNEY:**
==
**1ST WEEK:**
The first week was certainly the hardest. There were many temptations on the second day, especially in the shower, but I managed.

I was reading a lot of the stories here on reddit and yourbrainonporn.com. The stories increased my motivation and determination to get through the challenge effortlessly.

On day 5 I noticed my confidence got UP and when I went shopping, I was going down the street with my head held high like a Mr President.

On day 7 I was having a lunch with my family in a restaurant and I told them a good joke and all of us had a good laugh. I was really surprised at my behaviour. I never told jokes before.

**2ND WEEK:**
I was more positive and confident. I started exercising - running on a elliptical machine, doing pus-ups and sit-ups.

I broke my life-record. I did 85 push-ups, not at one go, but I did 20 push-ups, then rested for a minute, again 20 push-ups, rested, and so on. I never thought I could do so many.

On day 11 - I caught myself starting a small talk with the receptionist at my college dorm.

On day 12 - I contacted my two friends from high-school, they are both girls. We went for a pizza together.

Day 14 - I almost relapsed because I went online to chat with people and after several minutes it led to a sexting, which got me horny. But when I realized what I was doing, immediately I turned off the computer, got dressed and went out to see my grandparents at their cottage. At least I was in the company of people and that brought the urges down.

**3RD WEEK:**
I started wearing contact lenses, which made me feel good about myself. I met several people, had nice conversations, basically I was the one leading the conversations.

I saw a movie “The Pursuit of Happyness” with Will Smith starring - I can highly recommend it! Inspirational and motivational at the same time.

On day 21 I was feeling a bit depressed and moody. I started exercising to lift my mood and it really helped.

**4TH WEEK:**

While studying I am also an intern in one company, on this week they offered me a promotion but I had to decline the offer. My decision was not, however, irrational. I did a lot of thinking.

My sister asked to go party with her and meet her friends. So I DID go with her and had a great time meeting amazing people. The next day my sister told me I was pretty cool at the party. I was saying hi to the people first. I was the initiator of many conversations and people practically liked me.

**5TH WEEK:**

My will to do things increased tremendously. When I want to do something, I just do it. I procrastinate less than before. I watch TV shows less and I read more.

**6TH WEEK:**

Totally by accident I spilled a cup of coffee all over the floor. Funny thing happened. It didn’t make me angry or anything. I just laughed at myself being clumsy and went back to having a good time. 

I learned that it is us who make the decisions, nobody else. It is totally up to you how you react to the things that happen to you. 

On day 40 I was so energetic and happy. Before I was even anxious to make a simple phone call. Now I’m not afraid anymore. I just stepped out of my comfort zone!

On day 42 my sister asked me if I want to go to a music festival with her and her friends. I said YES. It will be great to get out of the house. I will be sleeping in a tent. I haven’t done than in years. I’m so looking forward to it. I might meet some cool girls there.

**7TH WEEK - NOW!**

Today on July 22nd it’s been 44 days. I am doing extremely fine. I’ve been reading a lot, boosting my vocabulary, listening to great songs, watching meaningful movies, going out meeting people (more than before), smiling a lot.

The great thing is that I’m not afraid to travel anymore. Now I just get on the train and go somewhere.

I must say that my life has changed so much in the last 44 days and the first person I would like to thank is Mr Zimbardo, the famous American psychologist. I found his book on Amazon by accident - The Demise of Guys - I bought it immediately and was dumbstruck at the effects the porn has on the brain. I watched his video on Ted talk site, I did some research, found yourbrainonporn site and eventually this reddit. So thank you every one!
 

### Books I must recommend:

* The Demise of Guys - Zimbardo - he talks about the effects of porn and computer games on the human brain

* The Four Agreements - Miguel Ruiz - this book changed my life as well. It describes why we do what we do. It changes your view of the world.

* Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill - another great book, some really great chapters even on masturbation (called Sexual Transmutation)
[http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm](http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm)

Then read any books you want to increase your vocabulary, to become a better conversationalist. I recommend getting a Kindle or any e-book reader so that you can read anywhere.



### Activities that helped me get through the first days:

* Exercising - running on a treadmill for at least 40 minutes.
* Doing push-ups and sit-ups
* Boxing - this was really helpful and effective. Recommended for everyone.
* Reading books - reading personal growth books always cheered me up
* Getting out of the house, even if you wander the streets, it’s still better than sitting in front of your computer
* Reading famous quotes (there are many motivational quotes)
* Contacting friends you haven’t seen in a long time
* Watching meaningful movies - The Pursuit of Happyness, Lo Impossible (about family surviving tsunami) - I shed several tears at the end of the movie, Million Dollar Baby (inspirational boxing movie), Yes Man (Jim Carrey comedy)
* Read something about positive thinking :) When I was feeling angry or just low, I started repeating positive affirmations and it really helped to boost my confidence! See this video [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAv8u4FhcoE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nAv8u4FhcoE)
* Do something you wanted to do for years. I learned to tie a tie for example :) I never knew how to do that, always had to ask my father to do it for me.
* Learn languages :) I started learning French and have been making good progress already :)
* Make others feel special by giving compliments
* Stop using Facebook, use it only in emergency. It's much better to do face-to-face conversations :)
* Learn how to dance - girls will appreciate that!
* Be proactive as much as possible - take responsibility for your actions :)
* A lot of people recommend taking a cold shower when having urges :)
* Get out of your comfort zone as much as possible! [Here are some tips.](http://personalexcellence.co/blog/ask-celes-comfort-zone/)
* Learn to cook some delicious meals. Not only will it make your mood better because you've learned something new, but also your partner will appreciate it :)
* Get better at non-verbal communication - this is really useful. I mean it's so great when you talk to someone and you spot microexpressions on their faces. You can see their mood (happiness, anger etc.), you can see if they are lying, you can see if they disagree with you but are afraid to tell you :) To be good at non-verbal communication, I recommend watching the TV Series Lie to Me, which is based on the actual research of a psychologist Paul Ekman and it's 90 % accurate :)

**I think the KEY to my SUCCESS and why I managed to go 44 days without any major problems is the realization of the effects the porn has on your brain. When you understand what happens to the brain, it will certainly help you get through the urges or temptations to masturbate. Whenever the urges come, think of the effects and you will be fine.**

That of course doesn't mean I will stop. I have committed myself to do NOFAP my whole life. I will make my uture girlfriend really happy. I can already see my future without any relapses.

I will write an update when I reach the day 90 and tell you about what's new and what happened in my life :)

I wondered if they are genuinely happy. I *empathized*.

This is just another reason why I think NoFap really works. And I'm happy to be making progress in this area - I no longer want sex to be about using people as sexual objects strictly to achieve orgasm. I want to achieve a higher level of intimacy  - something that I disconnected from sex a long time ago (partially due to porn, also due to bad things that happened when I was young).

Had a revelation last night watching the new batman movie. It was a bit incoherent, but the strength of batman and bain got me thinking about what makes us strong, and then by extension, what habits make us better people.

I came up with a list of six things that most modern men don't do consistently well. They aren't all related to strength. Here's the list/mantra. I explain each point below.

* Sleep
* Eat
* Lift
* Work
* Love
* Breathe

Do these six things right, and you'll be living better than most men.

###Sleep
----

How many hours did you sleep last night? For the past month, I've been waking up around 7:00, but not getting to bed until 12:00-12:30. 

It takes its toll. We can function without enough sleep, but we can't function well.

This affects everything else on the list. If you aren't sleeping well, you will be tempted not to eat well, your lifts will be off, you won't be able to work well, etc.

And for those of you struggling with the temptation to fap, it's harder when you're tired.

###Eat
----

Can you see your abs? 

If not, you're carrying extra fat around your waist. You may not be ""fat"", but you're above your ideal weight. This may not sound too bad, but the fact that your body carries excess fat is a sign you're not eating the way you should be. 

Eat right, and you'll feel good all day.

If you're like most western men, you eat a lot of junk. People differ on the ideal diet, but everyone agrees that processed, sugary foods are bad for you. 

So why are you still eating them? 

I've gone off my weightlifting diet plan this month, and can't see my abs as well as I could. I have less energy during the day. I've spent more money on junk food. 

Enough. There are plenty of delicious foods that are good for you. Eat those instead.

###Lift
----

Your body was built to life heavy things. Go to the gym, and lift stuff. You'll be a new man. And ladies, lifting helps you too. 

Find a gym with barbells, and track your progress each workout. Aim to lift a bit more each time. Squats, bench press, deadlifts, overhead press, and chins ups are a decent starting routine, split between two workouts.

This is actually essential to reaching your potential. Your body will work better when you give it the physical resistance it craves.

This isn't about getting big (though you will get bigger). It's about getting *strong*. I look strong, but I'm even stronger than I look, because barbells train you for strength. The look is a side effect.

Three times per week is a good amount. Starting Strength will teach you how to do the lifts, though you should get a trainer or a friend to check that you're doing them right.

There is a reason I called this ""lift"" rather than ""exercise"". This is different than cardio, or walking around a lot. If you have never gotten 50% stronger, then you don't know what it feels like. 

You get a constant feeling of energy and capacity. And several chronic pains simply melted away once my muscles regained their capacity. 

If you're skeptical, all I can say is: try it for a month, and see how you feel.

###Work
----

You know what you should be doing. There are certain tasks that, if you do them, will make a big difference in your life. 

But you aren't doing them. Maybe they're boring. Maybe you're afraid you might fail.

I don't know why you aren't doing them. But you should start.

Make time for important work, and keep it separate from playing. Trying to do both at once lets you do neither. 

###Love
----

This is especially pertinent for people on /r/nofap. A lot of us are damaged, and we are here to heal. We haven't been engaging in the normal human relationships that most people take for granted.

We've been substituting PMO for real girls. If you're here, you're on the right track. You're removing the problem.

But subtraction isn't enough. You need to add someone to your life. Go out and find her.

You can start small. Just go say hi. 

###Breathe
----

This one may be the most surprising. You probably think you breathe just fine.

Put one hand on your chest, and one on your stomach. Do they move?

Your chest *shouldn't* move, and your stomach *should*. 

This is called diaphragmatic breathing. It leads to more oxygen, and relaxes the body. 

Short, shallow breathing has its purpose. When we encounter a potential threat, stress and the fight or flight response are activated. Our breathing becomes shallow to focus on action.

But for everyday life, you should be breathing deeply, and slowly, through your stomach. 

Try it, you'll feel calmer. It's a form of meditation. Focus on breathing while you're walking around, and the distracting thoughts will melt away. 

I tried this in the subway last night, and was amazed how clearly I could see the world around me. The people, the lights, the details of the station. Breathing took me out of the world inside my head and put me back into the real world.

Breathe well, and everything else becomes easier.

**note:**Eventually, this type of breathing should become automatic, from what I hear. 

###Conclusion
----

These aren't obviously related to fapping or porn addiction. But nofap is as much about self-improvement as anything. If you're here, it's because you recognized there are things in your life that you need to fix.

It doesn't need to be complicated. Those six things cover most everything you'll really want to change, at first. 

And if you have these things in order, not fapping becomes very easy.

I would fix them in this order:

1. Breathe
2. Sleep
3. Eat
4. Lift
5. Work
6. Love

Love is last because you must make yourself a worthy partner before you can rightfully ask for an awesome girl. The girl doesn't make you complete. You make yourself complete, then you can get a girl. 

You are not making yourself complete *in order to* get the girl. It's just a pleasant side effect. 

I was in a bit of a flatline until yesterday. Since breathing well and sleeping better last night, I've felt my libido return in force. 

I've also felt a calm energy, and gotten much more done this morning than usual.

Try it yourself.

I dont know about you, but when I was a kid I was awesome. I was true to myself because thats all I ever knew, and because of that, good people and things gravitated toward me. Yes, I had much to learn, but the base principal remained the same.

But somewhere along the way I stopped being me, I let the pressures of society force me into becoming someone that was afraid of staying true to myself and let the weight of the world keep me down.

Every moment away from his job is spent doing something or other to numb himself:  he drinks alcohol, he smokes cigarettes, he smokes pot, he aimlessly browses the internet, he watches Netflix, he wastes time on Facebook, he plays his video games, and he masturbates.

He is a typical man-child in an age of destroyed masculinity.  He's traded his sense of passion for a sense of numbness.  He's traded the mystery and adventure of relationship and sex with real women for the hollow substitute of playing with himself in the dark while watching internet pornography.  He's traded his vitality and strength for soda-pop and potato chips.

He will waste his entire life with a nagging sense that something is wrong, but as long as he has his video games, junk-food, and 24-hour internet access he will make no effort to change.  It is a brave new world, and while he's read the book and thinks he understands it, he is the epitome of it.  He thinks what he's told to think.  He avoids confrontation like that plague, and flees back to his childish comforts.  He is a tool because he chooses to be a tool.

He is full of excuses, and he will never change.  But you are not him.  You do not accept such a pathetic life for yourself, because you are better than that.  You feel pain but you do not base your life on distracting yourself from it.  That is the difference between him and you.

It's explained why it's been so difficult to control my urges, and I now have confidence that I'm going to be able to reverse the downward spiral that has been my last 10 years. 

Outwardly I appear to be a successful guy. So much so , that my friends from college joke that I make life seem easy. I'm married to a beautiful woman and have a son that means the world to me.  Additionally I was fortunate to have had success trading stocks, and real estate investments that we're now probably financially secure for life. I say ""outwardly successful"" because it was just last month that I was researching ways on the internet to kill myself. 

I started my porn addiction in college, just casually viewing porn here and there. It escalated to watching more often, and then over a few years finally got to fetish and tranny porn. After college, I traveled for work and this is where the addiction really took control of my life. I would look at regular porn in my hotel room, and then troll the bars of the city looking for women for one night stands. This was often successful, but if it were not, I would start looking at tranny escort ads, and even meeting them every few months for sex (safe). 

Once the tranny porn got old, I started to look at gay porn online. I never had fantasies of men, but here I was drunk in my hotel looking at gay porn. This eventually led to me looking at gay personal ads and even answering and meeting them on multiple alcohol fueled occasions. 

I never understood until I discovered this site why I would view gay porn, and even met a few guys for sex. I'm not gay, nor am not attracted to guys even slightly. It seemed I was searching for a new and ""extreme"" ways of sexual stimulation and dopamine release. 

I got married a few years ago, and swore off my promiscuity forever. This worked....for a while. My addiction even ruined the news of my wife's pregnancy.....I was terrified for months that I might have HIV and unknowingly infected my wife and unborn son. This was when I started researching suicide methods -- I could not handle the fear and guilt. Thankfully the test came back negative.

I've been looking at porn every day for 10 years. Sometimes the regular stuff doesnt do it for me, and this leads to tranny porn. And disgustingly, I gave in to my urges and visited one last month. The guilt afterwards was unbearable. 

So here I am after living for 10 years on the edge of destroying both my families life, and my own...and somehow by good luck or divine power, I haven't fallen off the cliff yet. I still have the opportunity to turn my life around and be the husband and father I want to be. 

I'm thankful for this site, and YBOP to help me understand how I got to this point in my addiction. And more importantly helping me understand how I can change the course of my life. It's almost been a week since I've viewed any porn, and I can feel the desire to watch it slipping away. It's going to be a long process I know....but for the first time in the past 10 years I'm optimistic.

NoFap is my commune -- you are my brothers and sisters. Let me tell you of what made my day today.

Second longest attempt at NoFap, just started on my sixth week. Longest having been 60 something days. Positive this streak will crush that one. 25, M.

I usually get my groceries at this one place, and there's this girl there who is really pretty. I've been telling myself I should ask what her name is, but I've bailed many times. The usual excuse like ""oh, this is not the right time"", ""she's busy and I shouldn't interrupt"" etc.

I go up to the register, we greet with smiles and I start loading my groceries on the threadmill-thingy. I pay and start putting my stuff into the bag. Next to me is standing this older lady and I'm having this inner struggle over the whole thing, what I should do and should I do anything at all. ""Wait, we're not alone, what about this lady?"" ""What's the girl doing, should I just excuse myself and leave?"" and all kinds of bullshit that puts sticks in my wheels. I tell myself I have to make this count, before I pack all my groceries or she walks away from the register. Luckily she starts stacking tobacco into their dispenser so as far as concering her I'm in the green. Now I just need to pep myself into opening my goddamn mouth for once.

I finish packing, I don't care about the old lady, just let her watch us. I look up and say, ""Excuse me"". She looks at me and I say ""I've been wondering for a while what your name is, could you tell me your name?"". ""Yes, I can tell you my name, it's T"". You know how in movies they tell you to smile? Well I'd be damned if I didn't smile like a champ the entire time, it just came so naturally. I continued ""hello T, my name is C"". I told her how I've been coming there for a good while and it's far more nicer knowing what the personnel's names are. She agreed and pointed with her finger towards her chest ""..and since we don't have name tags.."". Anyway, I'm sure she'll eventually find out I haven't asked the names of any of the other employees. But hey, that's besides the point. I repeat her name again, still smiling, she's smiling too. ""It is nice getting to know you"", she replies ""Likewise"". I wish her a good day, so does she and I walk out feeling like a baws. Outside I'm almost shouting in joy and placed on my face is this big smile. It felt really empowering and releasing.

After doing this I realised how utterly nonsensical and baseless fear and anxiety are when it comes to talking to strangers. I did this entirely for myself and no matter what will come from our next meetings I don't care if I get rejected. I talked to her, sober, in broad daylight. I was friendly, smiled and looked her straight in the eyes. I walked out back straight and I planted that seed of possibility. Who knows what will come, maybe we'll just chat once in a while when I shop, maybe we'll become friends or maybe lovers. Time will tell.

This bit of wisdom was the top voted comment in a year old thread about how to be a man.  It has stuck with me.  It is about struggle and developing inner strength that needs no external validation.

As nice as it is to get support from SOs or here with the stories and badges.   In the end, a true man's struggle is his own.   

Inner strength comes when you become a man for yourself first.   It starts with self control and proceeds to self confidence and self growth and self esteem - all of which improve self control and the cycle repeats.

My own personal nofap journey is about self control first.   I am using my desire and intensity and redirecting it towards meaningful growth: physical, mental and my career.

It is very hard at times.  

My personal form of relief is to listen to loud music on my way home from the gym and growling and grunting as the incredibly strong man I am.   I then draw on those moments throughout my day both when I feel weak and when I need strength.   I am more assertive, more aggressive and more dominant.

I wish you guys well.

These techniques are a form of cognitive behavioral therapy. Self-talk is a critical part of rewiring your neural pathways and resetting your way of thinking. They do not need to be ""true"" every day and every minute of my life. But they do help me.

Dem super powers...,ForANewFuture,362,59,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1dciyn/40_days_shits_getting_serious_dem_super_powers/,"The last 10 days have been wild. Let me tell you that if you've hit a lull on your way up the NoFap day count, keep going! It only gets better.

Days 30 to 40 have been characterized by extreme horniness. My superpowers kicked in around the 20's to 30's (can't remember exactly), but they have been amazing. 

Superpower #1 - Extreme Confidence. It doesn't matter where I'm at, I walk around as if I belong there. This has been prominent in the gym as I've been pushing so hard the last 20 days I've been seeing great results. I walk with my head up, shoulders back, and eye contact with anyone that looks at me. I am not a ripped guy by any means. I was in the past more or less what they call an ectomorph, or someone who can't gain weight. That's been changing, and I actually get compliments on my physique now.

Superpower #2 - There has been an extremely large influx in the number of women who have been sending me dirty pictures. It's both extremely tempting, but also extremely rewarding. I used to have the mentality that ""I'll play it safe, I want her to like me. She may not like me if I ....."". Now It's ""Ah, fuck it, she's playing with you. Dare her to give you what you want. If she doesn't like you, move on."" In fact, last night one of the girls I've been talking to called me ""a man of risk"", which was immediately followed by a picture of her on all fours. It feels good. I've never once been that guy in my entire life. If you're at all worried about your looks, don't. I'm starting to think women care more about how you act, rather than how you look.

But I'm in control. I've been straight up offered sex, but have put it on the back burner until I finish this semester of school. I think that also helps, as women see that you're going to take care of yourself instead of dropping anything and everything to be at their place. But really, tease them, play with them, and bust on them. As long as you aren't a complete ass, you'll be fine. It also shows you have some spine. After my finals are over, I will be driving to that girl's house and spending a weekend. I like to think of it as my reward for a very long semester. We had a conversation last week about how I don't jerk it or look at porn anymore. I was telling her how badly I want it, and also mentioned how I'm probably going to come extremely fast. Her response? ""We can just go 14 times, it'll be alright"". I laughed, and started talking about something else to which she replied ""so, 14 times works for you?"". She wants me to wear her out.

Superpower #3 - Not giving a fuck. No, I don't walk around and act like an ass or talk down to people. It's simply not who I am. But, I do stand up for myself and put my needs / priorities first. I used to be that guy who would sacrifice and blow off everything important to him just so he could spend some time with a girl. Fuck that shit. I truly believe that if you work hard, show dedication, and are a somewhat social person, you WILL find a girl. But the mentality of you doing anything and everything you can to be with her needs to go. Don't put the pussy up on a pedestal....

The biggest change this NoFap go around is my mentality. I tried for a couple of months to get myself past the 7 day streak and failed miserably. I was almost more hurt by the lack of self control I had over myself, than the fact that I was still jerking it to women on my computer screen. I tried every little ""do this, or do that"" gimmick that would supposedly get me past the rough part, and none of it worked. I'll tell you the entire secret to nofap. This is literally the only piece of advice you need to succeed:

You have to want it bad enough to do whatever it takes to achieve your goal. If it isn't powerful enough to change how you act, then it isn't important to you.

That's it, the key to NoFap. Stop making fucking excuses and man up. One NoFapper gave me that kick in the ass and it worked. I started thinking about why I was relapsing. It wasn't so much that I really wanted to get myself off, it was that being so damn horny gets uncomfortable. Literally so uncomfortable that you want to do whatever you can to get rid of that feeling. This is what separates the men from the boys. You have to get comfortable with being uncomfortable. I literally think this is the key to success, no matter the field.

That's it, men. There's no stopping me now. When I do get laid in a few weeks I will probably come in about 30 seconds. Do I give a fuck? No, because I will have had sex with something other than my hand.",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,month2,True,t3_1dciyn,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1dciyn/40_days_shits_getting_serious_dem_super_powers/,

Of all the possible reasons for me to embark on NoFap, one of the most significant has to do with the way that porn twists my (and probably your) perception and expectations of reality. I found that not only was my body conditioned to be aroused by images and video rather than the real tactile contact of a partner, but that, psychologically, my expectations regarding sex were so skewed that I was seriously disappointed in the real thing. Porn presents an artificial, distilled sexual experience, and encourages us to identify with the subjects thereof, and over time this identification commandeers our libido. Over the course of a long-term addiction, porn use creates a sense of depersonalization regarding sexual experience, which reduces the desire for real partners who do not resemble those found in porn, and creates disappointment when our experience does not compare to that found in porn. This happens unconsciously, and if you're addicted, chances are that you are not even aware of it. Porn is a substitute for reality, but it's an effective one: every detail is designed to arouse, tailor-made to feed your sex-related dopamine circuits.

Moreover, porn is anxiety-free. There is no risk involved in opening up some images or videos. No chance of rejection, no demands on your part to say or do the right thing. I think that this is the reason why so many heavy porn users feel such anxiety when talking to women, or when in a real sexual experience - we are used to simply receiving such rewards with little to no work, and therefore we have built up no tolerance to the risk and anxiety which naturally come with it. P and M are easy and undemanding, and provide us with gratification quickly and efficiently.

This is their true danger - their ability to twist our perceptions of reality and to make us unsuitable for real partners. Only by leaving porn and masturbation behind can we reclaim our libidos for the real world, and discover the rewards of the possibilities around us.",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,month8,True,t3_xkdj4,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xkdj4/porn_and_hyperreality/,
1369375610.0,301,self.NoFap,1eygbq,2 Months Prostitute Free! For those of you thinking about using Escorts,prostaddict99,349,48,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1eygbq/2_months_prostitute_free_for_those_of_you/,"If you were like me - a virgin, a bit socially awkward, and with money to toss around - this is exactly how an encounter for me went down. This is also the thought process I use to remind me why I stopped and am taking on the NoFap challenge:



Let me explain to you exactly what will happen:

You will find a decent escort  for a minimum of $250 an hour.

**1)** She'll ask for verification that you aren't law enforcement. Congrats, you just gave an escort your work information, your full name, and your phone number. Goodluck running for office or having a high profile job one day - you're now bait for blackmail.

**2)** You're going to be heading to an ATM and sketchily withdrawing $260 worth of cash and stuffing it in a wallet. Congrats, take a good look at it because that's the last you'll ever see that money.

**3)** You call the girl an hour before the meeting - your socially awkward self is going to be nervous and breaking up your words on the phone with her. She's going to give you the address nonchalantly.

**4)** You arrive at the hotel, and you're in your car. You call her, and she gives you the room number. She says to wait 10 minutes, she still needs to get ready. As you're waiting sketchily in the parking lot hotel, you can't help but dart your eyes all around you and hope there aren't cops around. You try to avoid eye contact with anyone else in that lot because 'omg what if they notice im being weird and they realize what I'm doing?'

**5)** Time is close, and there's 5 minutes left to your appointment. You walk into the hotel lobby and start looking for the elevator. You try to look like you belong but with your nerves sky high and your naturally socially awkward self, the second you make eye contact with the staff your eyes widen like a deer in the headlights and you panic. You take a wrong turn - shit, you realize you have no idea where the elevator is and staff already saw you. What if your escort had multiple clients that day? What if they're catching on to something? What if the staff don't recognize you and confront you for being suspicious. You panic and avoid eye contact all you can and you finally find the elevator. Someone else is getting on with you. You hit the button to the desired floor and as you're on your way up, you're nervous as hell that the guy next to you will try and interact with you or even worse - get off on the same floor as you. He gets off on the floor before... Phew, close call.

**6)** You finally reach the floor of your appointment. You walk towards the door. You're nervous as hell. You look around making sure no one else is there. You knock. The door slowly opens, you walk inside, and from behind the door emerges the woman who's going to take your virginity. The first thought that enters your mind - ""damn, she's still a hot woman and I forgot I'm nervous as hell around them."" You clam up, nerves wound tight, she smiles and hugs you trying to make you feel a little more comfortable. Oh, and by the way, she's nowhere near as hot as her pictures or the fantasies you played in your head of her.

**7)** She asks for your 'donation', she thanks you, and asks if you would like to freshen up in the bathroom. You say sure. You head into the bathroom. Get undressed, and take a quick shower. You're extremely nervous - more nervous with negative energy than excitement. Your fantasies of ravaging a super model were shattered by 2 things immediately when you walked into the door - **1) **you forgot that you're still awkward around women and an escort is still another human being even if the sex is guaranteed, and there's no way you're going to have that fantastic sex you imagined in your head **2)** she isn't anywhere near as hot or as young as you thought she would be. You're just going to go with the motions at this point anyway. You dry yourself off, put on a towel, and head into the room with her.

**8)** She starts to have conversation with you, and after 10-15 minutes, you start to feel a little bit more at ease. Hell, maybe she'll compliment you a bit too. Now you might start feeling like 'omg this girl actually thinks im attractive!'. And she gets down to the business. 

**9)** Your hour is up. The experience was nothing like you thought it would be - it didn't meet up with any of the porn fantasies you had and you feel no different because of it. You didn't have the confidence to lead because your social inhibitions kept you from asking what you want. When your time is up she all of a sudden becomes very business like and you rush out of the door. 

**10)** You leave the room and head down to the parking lot avoiding all matters of eye contact on the way. You get into your car, and start driving back home. Your brain - no longer controlled by your dick - starts rationalizing what you just did. You spent $260 to lose your virginity with someone that lied in her advertisements about what she truly looked like. Regret starts sinking in, and you feel like shit about yourself. You're now worse off than you were before - and now you get to lie about the wonderful way you lost your virginity when you finally meet a girl: ""Umm... Yeah... uhh... I had sex once with my highschool crush - it wasn't as great as I had hoped and was super awkward... oh well."" 

If you think you have it rough with women now, how do you expect to act with the skeleton in your closet that you saw a prostitute as your first time?

**11)** Months go by, you realize that seeing an escort wasn't the magic bullet you had hoped for with women, and you're still nowhere close to finding a girl willing to sleep with you. You're heavily invested into porn and fantasy again, and you can't help but see yourself browsing escort sites again. 'Maybe this one will be different!'. You cave in, convincing yourself that you probably just need more variety to make you more sexually confident. Your dick leads you to another escort in another hotel, and the results are the same. 

**12)** Step 11 happens over and over - sleeping with prostitutes and jacking it to pornography is all your brain knows about sexuality. You're now hooked on the habit of seeking sexual gratification with your wallet - whether it be via porn, web girls, or that escort in the hotel. 

Conclusion - Don't see an escort - you got issues with self esteem and social anxiety you need to work on, and that has nothing to do with sleeping with a woman. That's the entire point of NoFap.

===============================================================================

EDIT: As ye all want my story 

I have known this girl for half a year. Had a major crush on her when we first met. Been talking to her on and off since we met. Well my parents were away,and i was back from college for the weekend so I had the house to myself. I was going to a guy i  knows 21st and well i invited her along. The plan was she would come to mine for pre-drinks and then we would head in to town. She had to get a bus to my house. Told her where to get the bus from. Turns out they had changed the bus route. I kept telling her that she was at the right bus stop. After she had waited 40 minutes i realized something was wrong. I offered to pay for a taxi. She wouldn't accept. Then after an hour i told her i would get the bus in to meet her. It was then that she found the actually bus stop. And immediately was on the bus and on her way to my house. I went and waited where she was to arrive. Needless to say I was mortified. A horrible start I thought. I hugged her in apology. We headed to my house to pre-drink but at this time it was already quite late. So we were pre-drinking. Conversation is flowing and by the time we are both done pre drinking Its half 11 and well i to keep her in my house so well i keep saying its to late really to go to town (kinda is in my country anyway). So i suggest we watch a movie. Shananaggins occur, great conversations going off in random tangents, fun in general also some how i was trying to check her pulse through her chest. Then we sit down to watch inception its around 2 in the morning.  Well that's when we start making out and then we move on to up stairs and then she is all like ""Are you one of those guys who has condoms next to his bed"" and i am like ""yes"" and she says"" i wonder what that says about you"" and i say ""obviously that i don't want to get a girl pregnant"" she responds with ""i meant does this sort of thing happen a lot to you"". Well i tell her i am a virgin. She doesn't believe me (Massive EGO boost that was). I swear to her, even pinky promised it took a while to convince her. eventually she was convinced. This probably had something to do with the fact i was so nervous. I was shaking. She said we don't have to do this. This did not help my nerves. I mean this is a girl i really like and not only do i really like her but also she is up for it. There I am having a little heart attack and well all of a sudden i go from having a all night long rock hard boner to not being able to get it up. I asked could we do it in the morning instead. She looks disappointed but she says ""yeah"". Ten minutes later we are making out and I jizz my pants. I tell her straight out. She says""well now i dont feel so bad so"". Next morning anyway we did it. I think i lasted for only like 3 minutes but yeah whooo.  I finally lost it and to someone i like. :]



Well i can say for certain that if it wasn't for nofap i would have simply not even have texted her but the sexual urge has built in me so much. I essentially wouldn't have even been embarrassed even if she turned me down that night. I had to find out what would happen because i cant lie around waiting anymore to find out if someone likes me. I have to get sexual release. So that gives me courage.
The best thing no-fap has done for me has been a over all improvement in mood levels. I used to get depressed a lot and now well not at all. I get agitated some times but its nothing compared to the depression i used to feel. No fap helped with energy levels and motivation and has made me more productive in general.

But what I'd forget is that my stomach would feel like garbage afterwards, I often got headaches, and I fucking felt lethargic all the time. 

Now, this is a much harder thing to do with porn, but I think it's worth talking about. It's similar. Do you really like watching porn? When I try to think about it really objectively, I kind of see myself like a lab rat who has electrodes hooked up to the pleasure-response part of his brain that activate every time he pushes a button. At first, you might think the little dude was just in heaven, sitting there spamming the living shit out of that button. But I think most psychologists would tell you that he's fucking miserable - he's sitting there, pressing that button, he has no clue why, but he just *has* to keep pressing it. He forgets to eat, sleep, fuck.

Sitting there, clicking on video after video, brain pathways lit up brighter than Madison Square Garden with dopamine  - do we really enjoy this? Or do we just think we do? And what about how you feel afterwards? The second I finish, my first thought is usually ""I fucking hate myself"" or something about hurting myself. And then I get pissed off because I relapsed, and my dick has this weird numb feeling to it for like three days - in fact, life has a weird numb feeling to it for a few days. 

I didn't intend this post to be this long - my original point was only this: examine your urges and experiences really closely (not too closely though, you know), and decide for yourself. Because I think that once you decide that *you* don't really like jerking off that much, but that the dopamine in you does, it really empowers you to say no. 

Last thought: how do you feel after you say no to an urge? Disappointed? What about 30 minutes later? I bet you're not so disappointed you didn't fap. At the time, it took all your willpower to say no. But I think it gives you courage knowing that the urges do go away, and that you will feel better for saying no, not worse.

1343854557.0,296,self.NoFap,xiy82,1 Year Update,can_fap_to_anything,370,74,142,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xiy82/1_year_update/,"I've been meaning to come in and update for a couple weeks now but I haven't had time to sit down and really write something out until today.

This will probably be my last update, I just want to thank the NoFap creators, community, and Reddit for changing my life. [6 months ago I posted an update](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/ob6xa/approaching_the_6_month_mark/), and since then I feel like I've found true meaning in life. I'd like to say that I'm more creative, intelligent, and hardworking than any other man I've come across - but that would be a lie. No, I can't take the credit for the path my life has come across now. At least not all of it. While I may not be more talented, the advantage I now possess is being incredibly driven. 

When I fapped, I was easily sated. I would have been content with living in a shack in a moderate climate with just enough food to eat and a reliable internet connection. Because at the end of the day, no matter how incredibly bland my life was, a quick fap would make everything feel better. Not much unlike a child's security blanket. I knew I had a problem, I think everyone who does it knows they have a problem. But, I didn't have any of the motivation or willpower required to put a stop to it. Just like with most gambling addicts or alcoholics, sometimes they have to hit rock bottom to realize they need to change. I was lucky in that I didn't have to do that, though if I hadn't changed when I did I could see my life going that direction indefinitely. 

There's no chance I would be where I am today without you, so thank you NoFap! Here's another update on some of the specifics of what has changed since I stopped fapping over the past year.


* I started an internet-based company. It grew, a lot. I've quit my dayjob and now work for myself. I now have multiple employees and run the business out of my home and use a cloud-computing office for communicating world-wide. I make more money doing this than I would have ever made at my old job even with years of incremental raises.

* I purchased a new property and started a vineyard and orchard. I was originally interested in brewing beer, and I still am, but right now I'm pursuing wine and hard-cider. Hard-cider is rapidly expanding market so I feel I need to jump on it while I have the chance.

* I've learned to speak German, Spanish, and am almost fluent in French. It's getting easier to learn new languages with each one I add to my arsenal. And it's very useful for doing business and working with employees overseas. (I'm in the U.S.)

* I took up blacksmithing as a hobby. I really enjoy making gardening tools, and I've made a few Katana. And most of the door handles in my house I've now made myself. 

* I discretely took an extended sailing course and for our anniversary a few months ago I surprised my wife with a brief sailing trip around southern Florida and stops through Key West and Miami. I took the advice of someone on here and forged her a ring out of 14K gold with sapphires embedded in it, and thanked her for the years of putting up with me as a fap addict (not how I actually worded it). She said she felt like she hardly knew me, but she loved getting to know ""the real"" me even more than the version she married. Needless to say, our relationship has improved ten-fold. I get laid *a lot* more often now too thanks to my increased interest in her. And I admit that 

* I've learnt to cook various ethnic cuisines. Indian, German, Thai, Greek, Spanish, ""real"" Italian. I compiled a family recipe book I'll be passing onto my kids someday (which I hope to have eventually). Though I haven't had time lately to cook much. My wife was previously working a full-time job but now we can afford for her to switch to part-time so she handles most of the cooking now. 

* I've made a few apps that are currently in both the Apple App Store and the Google Play market. None are selling, they are free with ads, but it was a good learning experience. With the programming I learned I was able to write a scheduling app for my company that has been quite useful internally. 

* I watched A LOT of movies. Though I still have a lot more to see. At first it was just something to distract me from either fapping or video games. You see, I was really addicted to both. Popping in a movie gave me enough stimulation to distract me from my addictions. Netflix beware, you need more movies! I also checked out Amazon Prime streaming, Hulu, and YouTube Movies. I still like Netflix the best because it doesn't have ANY commercials.

* I have a social life. Previously I was somewhat of a shut-in. We were part of a church, I didn't have any friends outside of it. Since starting no-fap I started researching theology and ended up leaving my church when I purchased new property, which lead me to find a new set of friends. It has been quite the journey. I feel enlightened for it. 

* I found a baby owl on the side of the road. It was injured and probably wouldn't have made it through the night. I nursed it back to health, and joined a raptor association. Unfortunately it isn't as effective at hunting as a falcon or hawk, but it's very loyal and friendly. I'm working with a friend training it to keep crows and rabbits away from our vegetable garden.

* I'm in better shape now than ever before. I'm in my 20's and haven't felt this comfortable with my physique ever. Physical exercise. Do it. I know everyone on here talks a lot about it helping with the urges and making you feel great, it really works.

* This one will sound hippy, but I started gardening and canning my own food. I had no idea how good tomatoes and fresh melons could taste. Peas, broccoli, squash, and carrots all taste about the same. Potatoes are also amazing, I had no idea they grew these humongous plants that eventually just shriveled up leaving multiplied delicious potatoes under ground.

* I recently purchased a kiln and have taken up pottery. I took it while I was in high school and always wanted to revisit it, but never had the motivation to go out and try. Well now I have it and all my cereal bowls are homemade. 

I think that about sums up everything that has changed, as a direct or indirect result of me stopping fapping. Understand that for me I had a severe addiction. I couldn't go one day without it, and it had to be several times a day at that. The same went for porn and video games.  I stopped all of those addictions, and it changed my life course. 

I hope that my experience might inspire others, but mostly I want to thank NoFap for everything it has enabled me to do. So, thanks again.",,False,,t5_2skrn,1343855201.0,,year1,True,t3_xiy82,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xiy82/1_year_update/,

THESE ARE ALSO MAINLY THE POSITIVE CHANGES. THEY ARE, HOWEVER, GENERAL CHANGES THAT MOST PEOPLE SEE THAT YOU CAN MOST LIKELY EXPECT FROM UNDERGOING THIS CHALLENGE.**

**DISCLAIMER: ALTHOUGH R/NOFAP IS DIRECTED TO BOTH MEN AND WOMEN AND STRAIGHT/GAY/BI, THESE EFFECTS WILL FOCUS ON THOSE THAT STRAIGHT MEN UNDERGO. THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME THINGS THAT DO NOT APPLY TO YOU (E.G. IMPROVED GRADES IN SCHOOL), BUT THOSE HAVE AN EQUIVALENT FOR OTHERS (E.G. IMPROVED PRODUCTIVITY AT WORK).**

I have compiled this list mostly to convince myself of all these benefits (and wow am I now motivated to keep going) and because I will possibly one day use this to write an essay about nofap. I, however, als wanted to share this with you guys.


&gt;POSITIVE CHANGES


**PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE - FEELING MORE ALIVE THAN EVER**

* Increased happiness/pride/joy/confidence/calmness
* Happiness is found in simpler things (a walk, a nice meal, music)
* Experiencing more emotions, feeling less numb to life
* Loving/accepting yourself
* Taking a stand for yourself/not backing down/stating your opinion
* Increased hope, a better future always seems obtainable, no matter how difficult things get

**SOCIAL INTERACTIONS - BECOME AN ALPHA MALE**

* Less social anxiety/fear of judgement
* Initiate conversation more often
* Increased conversational skills/eye contact/smiling
* Increased vocabulary/words come to you more easily
* Feel more in touch with other people (and their emotions)

#MORE FOCUSED ON INTERACTION WITH WOMEN

* Real women look more attractive
* More attention to interaction/physical touch than the visual
* Increased motivation to meet/talk to women (butterflies won't go away, but your sex drive will provide a counter-force to overcome them)
* Creation of a magnetic ""sexual aura"", a sexual energy that attracts more attention from women both known and unknown
* Feel less intimidated in the presence of an attractive woman
* Better sex (enjoying the sex itself, not just pursuing orgasm)

**PHYSICAL AND MENTAL - THINK CLEARLY, TAKE ACTION AND LOOK GOOD**

* Increased determination, energy and productivity (i.e. reading, writing, drawing, working out...)
* Increased quality of sleep

#SPECIFICALLY PHYSICAL

* Better posture/appearance (i.e. by working out + clearer skin, less acne)
* Increased athletic performance (stamina, physical strength
* Deeper/more manly voice
* (Increased vision has been reported by very few people)

#SPECIFICALLY MENTAL

* Increased clarity of mind/loss of brain fog
* Increased concentration/focus (i.e. better grades)
* Better decision making (both short- and long-term)
* Improved memory
* Less mood swings
* Better dream recall/more vivid dreams (and possibly more positive dreams)

&gt;SOME THINGS TO CONSIDER

* The urges to PMO do not go away completely, but you don't feel like acting on them anymore. You just put your energy into doing other things
* Most people undergo a flatline at some (or more) point(s) during this challenge (decreased libido)
* If you do relapse, you are way more likely to be sickened by the extremes in porn you used to find arousing
* Fantasies/old videos still pop up in your head, but it's easier to get rid of them now
* More wet/porn/masturbation dreams

(Note: if it weren't for nofap, I wouldn't have even put any effort into making this list and then formatting it to put it on reddit)

TL;DR: nofap changes your life

I'm a medical professional, 28 years old and I quit fapping in early January. I started out with a 7-day streak, relapsed once and am fap-free since then.

I started fapping really early, long before puberty, and it became a habit. When I was 12 or 13, I found the first bits of porn and dad's stash of dirty magazines, as well as explicit stories. When I got my first internet connection, I browsed for porn, in the old modem days mostly flicks of 15 seconds. Then, everything got faster. When I was 18, my life got worse. In hindsight, porn was a way of stimulating myself to escape the problems of daily life. High-speed internet made the availability limitless. Shortly thereafter, being a nerd (programming in obscure languages, yeah!) as an additional hindrance, my love life declined and for the following 8 years, I couldn't get a girlfriend or even get laid. I developed social anxiety and depression. It got so bad that I had to take anti-depressants for about a year. They were a real relief and raised me back to life from a deep hole. I finally got back on the track with the girls, but only sexually - emotionally, I still felt quite empty.

The next step in bettering myself was a diet, I lost 20 pounds and felt much better by eating clean (thanks, /r/keto). In hindsight, grains and sugar now seem as unhealthy to me as arsenic.

Last year, I was still a big-time fapper. High-speed porn, limitless, with ever narrowing, completely random fetishes. My problem with real world sex wasn't ED (only once), but DE, and it still is. My advanced fapping technique simply was too far from normal sexual stimulation that I have desensitized myelf so much that I never came from PIV sex. I even visited a professional in the hope that her experience would overcome my desensitized state, to no avail. It was only awkward.

I found this subreddit and it immediately clicked. My experience with diet was that not doing something is a far more powerful intervention that doing something.

So I tried.

What is my experience with NoFap?

Well, the first couple of weeks were hard. Especially during the first 2-3 weeks, I was horny all the time and even noticed that my one hand magically reached for my penis. I pulled it back with my other hand. After that, I had multiple flatlines. I moved all the porn on my hard-drive to a friend's hard-drive, ""just in case"" (I don't want it back, ever!). My mood stabilized after about 80 days. I had sex three or four times in that phase, and it neither hurt nor helped.

Since then, I noticed a couple of things. 

First of all, I have a clarity of mind unprecedented. Through my diet, the phenomenon of mind fog completely disappeared (grains suck). NoFap was not a relief from mind fog for me as it was for others, but it extended my vision, my forward-thinking from a couple of minutes/hours/days to months and years. I have taken more and wiser long-term decisions in the last 70 days or so than in the last five years. Too vague? Here's an example: Recently, a friend of a friend had trouble with her boyfriend, and needed some time off and find a place to sleep for one night. I offered that she could sleep at my place. Though she tried multiple times to coerce me into sex, I was easily able to hold back because the thought of possible and likely long-term consequences were more powerful thant the short kick from sleeping with a girl. I don't think I would have been able to say no half a year ago. BTW, she thanked me the next day for not sleeping with her.

Second, I seem to spread a sexual aura everywhere I walk. Women respond to me in the most crazy ways, asking for my number after three minutes of talking, making explicit remarks etc. And the best thing is, I don't care, because every time some tramp wants to get into my pants, I think to myself that she's just not worth it, I want a real relationship. Problem is of course that not responding to such overt female advances it drives them crazy, because they are not used to rejection from men and they try even harder then. If you ever thought that in your most stupid fapper days you behaved in the utmost awkward manner and your behaviour could never be topped, look at a woman facing raw male sexual energy.

Third, I get more of my shit done. You know these boring tasks everywhere that need to be done and are as pleasurable as a root canal treatment? All that paperwork? I get 'em done.

Fourth, I think less. The constant babbling of the self in my brain is no longer that dominant, and sometimes a bit of calamity comes in and my subconcious takes over, simply doing ""the right thing"".

Fifth, I take a stand. Where I would have backed down last year, I make a clear and loud statement that I disapprove of something. A female colleague attempted to look at my cell phone while I was messaging privately. My statement was heard by another 10 colleagues. She was pissed and I later told her that it was not personal, but that she simply crossed a border I am not able to tolerate. I can tell that this action made me interesting to her.

Sixth, I feel empowered. I am no longer the pawn, I am the one who makes the rules of his life (as far as that is possible in a complex civilization). And it comes with a lot of inner peace.

So, what is my conclusion with NoFap? No superpowers. A tough struggle that seems to be worth all the sacrifices of the first couple of weeks. NoFap improved my life very much, noticeably, but slowly. As the main page reads, it is the ultimate challenge. Go for
it.

What are my plans? Get a little bit better every day, without any stupid self improvement tricks. Get rid of my DE by not touching myself long enough. Not looking at porn. That's it. My credo: It will happen because I don't do one specific thing. Not because I follow a thousand ""expert tips"".

tl;dr: NoFap is da shit. This is a case report, you need to read it in order to understand it.

1357940424.0,289,self.NoFap,16egyl,I quit fapping before I knew of nofap.

I read it every day in the morning, and in trying times during the day. 

My idea is that people really are rational and will listen to reason, but they are *slowly* rational, which means that they will have to hear reason many times before internalizing it (even if they agree with it). If you repeat the reasons not to fap many times, it will eventually become easier not to fap than to fap, because you will be very clear that you're only hurting yourself. 

Right now, when you fap, you are only marginally aware that it's bad for you, and you're using *willpower* to stop. You're thinking: ""I need to stop this. I can do it this time!"" Well, willpower doesn't work. Just like you need very specific tools to fix a specific car issue (and you won't do it by staring at it and willing it to fix itself), you need to think very specific thoughts which will make it clear that you're hurting yourself. Here are thoughts that worked for me, written in a text that I read daily:

---
I no longer wish to masturbate. Masturbating has plenty of consequences which I find unpleasant. 

Without masturbating I’d be rested all day and could deal with more challenging tasks and be more productive. That would make me happier in many areas other than masturbation. 

Masturbating makes me fall asleep harder, which in turn makes me a wreck the next day.  

If I stopped masturbating, I’d directly get more time to do other stuff each day. 

If I don’t masturbate sex gets better because of my full sacks, and I start actively seeking it instead of avoiding it. With full sacks, I am always ready and interested in sex, so I won’t miss any opportunities. 

Without masturbation I am more interested in females even non-sexually, so I make more intimate contacts, try harder, and am more charming. 

Research shows that imagining that you achieved something which you didn’t activates the same reward circuits as if you did, so you don’t try as hard to really achieve it. Without masturbation, I won’t imagine having sex with girls, and my positive tension will grow until I find a girl to have sex with.

Research also shows that testosterone is higher in people who don’t masturbate.

My memories are all that I have of my past. I remember none of my masturbation sessions, but I remember most of my lays. Less masturbating means more pleasant memories.

To stop myself from masturbating, I will always wear pants in the house.

It helps not to got to porn sites, and to stop myself whenever my hand goes to my penis.

I masturbate mostly in situations when I should be doing something else, so I flood my mind with an orgasm and lose the pressure to be productive. I no longer want to do that. I’ll be more satisfied in the long run if I ignore my wish to masturbate and go work instead.

I don’t really masturbate to release my urge for sex. The urge comes when I’m masturbating. I start masturbating so that I wouldn’t have to do other stuff, that I wouldn’t be bored, and out of sheer habit to masturbate when I’m on my PC. If that isn’t correct, then why don’t I get a wish to masturbate for weeks when I’m on vacation with my friends?

When it feels like I won’t make it, I know that the urge will soon pass and that I’ll feel very satisfied with myself. If I masturbate, I can be sure that an immense feeling of guilt will follow.

The longer I don’t masturbate, the easier it becomes. It will get easier with time and I’ll ditch it just like I did eating at McDonald’s and watching television.

I know that I don’t even want to masturbate. The unwanted consequences far outweigh the wanted ones. There is no desire, there's just the habit.

---


I removed some benefits/reasons that probably pertain only to me.

These are just an example and it's likely that some of these won't work for you, and some others will. That's OK. The point is, you need to think them often, otherwise you will soon forget them and start fapping again.


tl;dr: Repeating the reasons why you don't want to fap daily is far more effective than using willpower and believing that you will somehow just do it this time.

1376393692.0,292,self.NoFap,1k9svm,45 Lies Your Mind Uses to Keep You Addicted,CrypticVoice,338,46,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1k9svm/45_lies_your_mind_uses_to_keep_you_addicted/,"From experience, I've learned the urges are easy to resist through the proper techniques and with practice. A key factor I'm sure many--both newcomers and older--are struggling with is the rationalization. Although, not many of us are consciously aware of it.


The mind naturally tries to justify the urges for porn, sex, and masturbation, because it's convinced we need it. When I started hearing its reasons for all of these, that's when I most frequently found myself relapsing. 


**We need to be aware of this one truth: becoming clean means not satisfying the urges.** Let that really sink in. Anything else your mind tells you is merely an attempt to make you relapse.  


There is no gray area or ""moderation."" Only addicts have ever had a need to reach the justifications I'll be listing, and you can't cure an addict by giving them the very thing they've been abusing. 


It's difficult to stay clean when we believe this ""reasoning"" our mind tries to give us. And living in a society that encourages irresponsible sex doesn't make it easier. We have to fight its ""logic"" with truth, otherwise you will eventually believe it and make that your excuse to relapse. Remember, that's not an if, that's a will.


An ignorant addict is a committed addict. If you don't know the facts behind porn and the tricks your mind uses, you will eventually reach incorrect conclusions that will guarantee a continued addiction. 


Keep in mind: I've experienced all of these justifications, and you can expect them to try and make you relapse as well. But in time, when you recognize them as lies, you'll find they disappear and you're left with just the urge which is much easier to control afterward.


**DISTRESS** 


Recovery is an emotionally exhausting phase in our lives. It won't be long before we experience a moment that is very stressful. At these times, our guard is weakened and we're more willing to accept and/or create a reason to relapse. 


1) I'll always be lonely 


2) Now that I'm addicted, I'll never have a relationship 


3) This will take my mind off things 


4) It's the only way I can feel good 


5) Only this will make the pain go away 


6) I need it to think clearly


7) This will make the urge stop 


8) I'm afraid of life without it 


9) I already started, I can't leave it 


10) I'm not strong enough to quit 


11) I'm too ashamed now 


12) I can never forgive myself 


13) The world will never accept me because of what I've done


14) I'm so angry; this will calm me down 


**""RATIONALIZE IT AWAY** 


15) It's perfectly natural 


16) Others do it so it must be okay 


17) I'm the problem, not what I'm doing 


18) I can control it without getting carried away 


19) I'll do it less and less until I quit 


20) This is what I want, so this is okay 


21) Resisting it is unhealthy 


22) If I don't watch the hardcore stuff, then it's okay 


23) It's fine if I watch amateur stuff instead of pornstars 


24) It's okay if the people aren't real 


25) I don't have to watch porn, I can just masturbate (and vice 
versa) 


26) I can masturbate if I don't fantasize 


27) No one's getting hurt if it's just me involved 


28) As long as no one else is suffering but me, I can handle it 


29) If no one knows about it, it's okay 


30) I can quit when I'm older and stronger 


31) Some people can't be cured or don't have the willpower 


32) I'll wait until I have a boyfriend/girlfriend to quit 


33) If I do all this stuff with my boyfriend/girlfriend instead, then it's 
okay 


34) No one else cares so why should I?


35) This is what I am and I should accept it


36) There's nothing wrong with masturbation


37) I don't need boundaries in sex


38) Some people have problems but it's not with sex or porn 


39) There is no responsibility in sexuality. As long as it's consensual, it 
doesn't matter what I do or how I think 


40) If people act like sluts, we should treat them like sluts 


41) Porn and masturbation and sex are tools meant to be used


42) If a person wants to be used for sex or porn, we should use them


43) The urge will always be there, so I should just give up and keep using 


44) If I want to dirty myself, who cares? 


45) It's natural to ogle someone and want to have sex with them


Like I said, I suffered through all of these--and there's more than what I listed--and a few variations of them, and not one of them could help me. But they weren't supposed to; their job was to make me relapse and nothing more. From your mind's perspective, you're denying it something you ""need,"" so of course it's going to try and convince you to relapse. Follow even one of these lies, I guarantee you will never get clean.


It's not enough to go a few days or even a year without this stuff. If nothing about us changes, we're just time bombs waiting to relapse. 


Our viewpoints on sexuality have been heavily shaped by fiction and misinformation. From porn, to growing up around people who didn't know the facts, to examples from the media (by media, I mean novels, movies, games, you name it). We took lessons on reality from fantasy and look where it got us. 


Getting clean requires these three things: recognizing the truth about sex addiction and porn, changing our conditioned mentality, and becoming sexually independent. 


Some might ask what I mean about the third one. It means you can walk through life without having a desperate need to have sex or masturbate. It means not needing to be in a relationship. Of course you can want to be in one, but you won't feel a need to. If you don't happen to run into that special someone, you're okay living by yourself. (But you also have to know that a real relationship is work; it's not as simplistic as two people liking each other. But that's for another topic) It also means knowing humans are people, and are to never be used for our sexual gratification under any circumstances. 


And in case this was misconstrued, no, I'm not telling you that you should never have sex.


So that's it. No bs. Take what I've shown you and use it to help you in your recovery.

It was fucking crazy. It was so easy to walk up to women and compliment them and strike up a conversation. I wasn't intimidated at all and hit on every hottie I saw.

Hey guys. 
When I was getting through my own problems with pornography and masturbation, this community helped me more than I could have believed. I don't think I could have done it without you guys. 

After I gave it up, I went through a lot of articles and papers on what PMO does to your brain and ended up writing a book about it to help those that needed a little extra motivation to give it up, and some facts and logic there weren't anecdotal or religious. 

Amazon let's me offer my book free for 5 days a few times a year and I want you guys to benefit. I'm not posting this anywhere else, so this one is just for you guys.

I stopped on December 31, 2012 and have been on hard mode ever since. Noporn, nofap, no edging, etc. I'll put my thoughts into a list, in no particular order - Just my thoughts.

- nofap made me realize that I can overpower my brain and body. I had a horrible PMO addiction. Breaking that addiction was basically me giving a giant middle finger to my inner urges, and coming out victorious. That feeling is indescribable.

- Overpowering your temptations for a long time will make you realize things. ""If I can overpower this... I can do anything."" THAT'S how nofappers become gods (superpowers). They stop giving into their immediate desires, and they realize that if they can overcome fapping addiction, then they can overpower their fears and unhealthy temptations in other phases of life. This is where the superpowers come from. It's nothing magical.

- Stopping fapping opens up a lot of free time and a LOT of free energy that you didn't have before. If you choose to replace fapping with something healthy, then your life is about to take a drastic change for the better.

- I started a *very* strict diet and exercise routine for the last 90 days. Ask me if you'd like the progress pictures.

- My energy levels have been in-fucking-sane. I can't wait to work out every day, and my off days suck. I want to be in a gym. I want to be improving my body constantly. And I don't even consider looking at porn a possibility anymore. It's not a part of who I am, and I refuse to ever go back.

- I read this earlier today, and I couldn't put it any better myself - ""If you want it bad enough, then you'll do it."" If you want to complete 90 days without fapping, then you will. If you don't want it bad enough, then there's nothing we can do to help you! YOU have to want it for YOURSELF. Convince yourself that you are strong and you don't need to fap, and the sky is the limit for how great you can be.

**Advice**

If you're looking for advice, then I can tell you a few tips.

- You have to convince yourself that you're worth it. This is a mental struggle, through and through. It's no cakewalk, and if you're not convinced that you can do it, then you won't do it. Don't go into this thinking ""Meh, I'll probably relapse after a week or so."" Fuck that. Don't give yourself the mental option to relapse, and you won't.

- You **must** find a replacement for fapping. If you fap as much as I used to (a lot), then you'll need something else to do to prevent yourself from slipping back into your old routine. I chose to get extremely into my diet/working out/self improvement. You can commit yourself to video games, reading, working out, taking walks, doing pushups, playing with your pets, WHATEVER!! Just pick an activity that you can do WHENEVER you have a temptation, and do that activity every time. In the first week or two, I can't tell you how many times I had to stop what I was doing, drop to the floor, and do as many pushups as I could in a row. That stopped me from fapping quite a few times.

- Get real life support. /r/nofap is amazing support, but having an accountability partner in real life is even more important. I had two people that I texted constantly about this, and having them there to support me whenever I got tempted was invaluable. I recommend you get a couple of really close friends to keep you honest.

- Stop making excuses. I didn't realize how many excuses I used to make for myself. ""There's always tomorrow"" ""I'll be fine"" ""It won't matter"" ""Fapping/skipping workouts/eating horrible foods is OK."" ""I have my whole life to turn this around. I'm only 26.""


BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU DON'T HAVE YOUR WHOLE LIFE. YOU'RE ONLY PROMISED TODAY. YOU LITERALLY HAD A 1/1,000,000,000,000,000 CHANCE TO BE HERE. ACT LIKE IT. Yesterday, you said tomorrow. Someday is not a day on the calendar. Fucking act like the boss that's lying dormant inside of you, grab your balls, and take this life over. 

**This is the only chance you'll ever have, and every day you don't take action, you're one day closer to wasting your only chance. Forever.**


I had to drill those kinds of thoughts into my head every day, and it worked. I think about life SO much differently than when I started. I look at everything and everyone with such a different outlook.


Stop wasting your time. You only have a set amount of it, and one day, it will all be gone. Start living life like this is the only one you have.

The hardest part is the beginning. Going the first day without fapping is like asking a fish not to swim. You just can't help yourself not to do it.

The hardest part is going a week. Starting the thing was easy, but after 3 days your balls feel like they're going to explode and there's nothing to relieve the pressure. It's like plugging a geyser. 

The hardest part is going two weeks. You feel great the first week, but then the second week you're constantly poking and edging your dick. Morning wood becomes morning edge and whoops your hand is on your dick. It's like asking a kid not to sample everything at the ice cream parlor. 

The hardest part is hitting the month. Finally, after all this time of constantly looking at your dick and seeing it rise and fall with every NSFW link you've hit the one month. It's like asking a 21 year old to not blow his wallet in Vegas. 

The hardest part is the moment after you orgasm by fapping. It's depressing. 

Then - magically, miraculously - the girl of your dreams walk through a door and your attention goes from analyzing the size and strength of the main vein to the utter beauty she has. The obsession of how many days your counter is evaporates. 

One day, with the women of your dream next to you or not, you return to NoFap. Shockingly, the counter has risen, dramatically, in your absent. After thinking back, you realize that you haven't fapped in ages now - in fact, you've completely forgotten all about NoFap and porn in general. **NOT** doing porn has become a habit, the first time since you've even jokingly googled ""naked women"" all those years ago.

1367729481.0,286,self.NoFap,1dpuy9,I've been on NoFap for 6 months as of today. Here are the reasons why I'm continuing.,forwardly,322,36,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1dpuy9/ive_been_on_nofap_for_6_months_as_of_today_here/,"As of today, I have been on NoFap for exactly half a year. I’ve had high highs and very low lows throughout this time, but regardless of how hopeless and helpless I have felt, I continued to do this, and I continue to lengthen my list of reasons to. Below is that list.  

**Clarity of mind**

As most of us know, NoFap can provide a marked mental sharpness after a certain period of abstinence.  This is a huge motivator for me, as my success in school directly depends on my ability to maintain focus.  During periods when I am fapping frequently, I become disorganized, miss appointments, forget assignments and quiz dates, have a difficult time studying… the list goes on.

**Freedom from guilt and shame**

These two states of mind have followed me every day for the greater part of my life.  There has never been a time when I have felt proud of vicariously fucking someone, and I can confidently say that there never will be.  I have longed for a very long time to be able to look at people in the eye and know that there is no longer, just beneath the surface, the recollection of binging for hours on end the night before.  I want to be able to look back on this time and smile.  I can’t do that just yet, but that day is much closer than it used to be.

**Confidence**

This almost goes without saying.  One week into a streak and I am, without a doubt, more inclined to talk to strangers, to make eye contact, to raise a point or ask a question in class, to introduce myself to a girl, etc.  As someone who has spent most of their life feeling shy, even inadequate, the confidence that I gain through NoFap is invaluable.  

**Motivation**

Similar to confidence, a boost in motivation is something that most of us have experienced on NoFap.  During periods when I fap infrequently, more things get done, and I feel better about doing them.  It’s wonderful.

**Self-worth**

This is closely related to being free of guilt and shame.  As much as I try (and you should too) to not let my degree of success with NoFap have a strong bearing on my sense of self-worth, it does.  Long, sleepless nights and wasted afternoons of porn binging reliably make me feel like a shitty person, and they always will.  If I am to continue building my self-worth, I need to continue to avoid this.

**Wholeness**

Take this one however you will.  I originally had this listed as “spiritual wholeness”, for lack of a better descriptive, but I tend to wince at the word, so I took it out.  Leave it in if it applies ;). It’s a bit of an abstract thing to talk about, but generally I feel more whole as a person when I haven’t PMOed in a while, and if I had a soul, it would be cleaner.  I think other people can see this as well, which can open the invitation for healthy people into your life.

**Affirmation that I can stick to something**

I have a long history of not finishing things, which is something that I want to change about myself.  I rarely finish video games, many of my books have bookmarks midway through, I generally stop exercising as soon as I start, etc.  I need to stick this one out more than I do most things.  Getting to 90 days (and beyond), will be a huge success for me, not just in conquering addiction, but also in staying committed to something.

**Comfort with discomfort**

This is something u/Self_as_object (Mark Queppet / Sacred Sexuality guy) has talked about, and which really resonates with me.  This is one of those things in NoFap that can carry over into other parts of our lives.  Becoming comfortable enduring the uncomfortable can enable us to break our self-confining habits and start to meaningfully work on becoming the people we envision ourselves to be. As clichéd as that is around here, it’s true.

**Exercising delayed gratification**

This stems from the previous point, and it’s just as valuable.  Whether or not you buy into the idea that we all suffer from hypofrontality, or some other form of neurochemical damage, I think exercising the ability to put off something that you desperately want so that you can achieve something more rewarding is beneficial in its own right.

**Being an incredible (eventual) boyfriend**

For me, looking at porn precludes feeling the full extent of love and adoration (and often respect) that’s possible towards my partner, and introduces a dissonance that increases with use.   I started NoFap after my last relationship ended.  During this time, I have grown more than I have in any other period of my life.  I believe I have something legitimately wonderful to offer the next person that I bring into my world.  I want that person to be fortunate that they are with me, and I think this is now possible. 

**Cessation of objectification**

Invariably, after looking at porn for any length of time, I find myself seeking visual stimulation from any and every girl in my field of view.  There’s a stark contrast between this kind of pleasure seeking and actually appreciating someone’s beauty.  After I’ve distanced myself from porn for a while, I’ve found that I stop looking for the same visual cues on girls that would lead me to click on them if they were in a thumbnail.  Instead, I began to take in the whole person (&lt;key word), and feel desire for them to be in my life, rather than on my hard drive.

**Emotional wealth**

By whatever mechanism you subscribe to, excessive porn viewing and masturbation can dampen your (or at least my) ability to feel emotions to their fullest.  I’ve found this to be true during every long streak.  I had my first good cry in several years after about ten days into one of my early streaks.  Since then, I’ve cried many times – while listening to music, reading a story, thinking about people in my life, even beautiful ideas can make me emotional.  This wasn’t the case before NoFap.  For as long as I can remember, I have been melancholy and generally unaffected by the world around me.  Certain things were powerful enough to cut through the haze I lived in, but mostly I floated.  I was uncomfortably numb.  The reversal of this has been one of the more profound changes I’ve seen since starting NoFap, and has been particularly rewarding.  

**Creativity**

Emotional sensitivity has given rise to increasingly frequent bursts of creativity.  Being moved by something you’ve created is truly rewarding, and incredibly reinforcing.  I’ve written more music that I’m actually proud of in the last few months than I have in the previous four years since I started.  I also find myself daydreaming about things far removed from the dramas in my life.  This is a far cry from what has historically occupied my mind, which was generally an odd mixture self-criticism and imaginary situations in which I was exalted in some way.  Increasingly freer from this, I now find myself inspired to think and to create again. 

**Increased arousal when needed**

This hasn’t been as much of an issue for me as it has been (and still is) for a lot of people.  Still, I’ve found myself in situations where my sex drive wasn’t as strong as it should be, usually right after a binge.

**No more lost sleep to porn binges**

This is a big one for me, as I go through periods when I have a hard time sleeping anyway.  Waking up after four hours of sleep because you stayed up compulsively porning out always sucks a lot, especially if you have important things to do that day.  I recently binged the night before a funeral after  which I had to interact with family members I hadn’t seen in several years.  I was horribly awkward and visibly worn out the entire time, and as a consequence, I was unable to really catch up with anyone, and probably left a less than positive impression. Getting enough sleep is one of the most important things you can do for yourself. Coupling sleep debt with reeling from a binge is horrifically uncomfortable and something that I don’t ever want to repeat.

**Self-love**

NoFap is ultimately an act of self-love.  This, above all, is the most important reason that I have to continue.  If we can keep in mind that we are doing this out of love for ourselves, then we can learn to forgive ourselves when we fail, we can justify the pain and discomfort, and we can begin to heal our scars.  It both inspires and is born out of our perseverance.  If you take away one thing from me today, I hope it’s this.

Some friends of mine came across my post and apparently some of them still talk to my ex… and showed it to her.

Fast forward I get a phone call today from my ex. We have not spoken to one another since she walked out on me. Literally not one word in years after that night. This was a shock to me, no PMO was bad enough now I had to deal with emotions I had not dealt with in a very long time.

After a few minutes of uncomfortable small talk she tells me she is proud of me for owing up to my problem and trying to change. She did reinforce what I suspect was our biggest issue that PMO drove us apart. She felt she could never live up to the girls in the videos. I had killed her self confidence, she found someone else that made her feel good about her, and she left. 

We both cried a lot, it was a very painful phone call. She lastly said that the girl I met must really be special for me to want to change, my ex was upset that she could not get me to change before we split. 

We ended the call with her encouraging me to fix myself for me and no one else. She was proud that I finally realized I had an issue and offered to be a shoulder if I needed one. I never in a million years expected to hear from her. I am honestly still shaken by it. Right now I am a mess, I want nothing more than a drink. Writing this is about the only think keeping me from porn. I know this is long winded and nothing more than a rant but I had to get this out. Plus everyone on here I have interacted with are all very supportive and keep me in check so I kinda felt the need to check in.

I can certainly relate.

But I had an epiphany in the gym today.  Excessive fapping is just a symptom of a much larger problem I have: wasting my life.  I fuck around way too much.  If I'm not fapping, I'm clicking through stupid pictures of cats or memes, or watching a stupid tv show, or refreshing my email, or browsing facebook, or half-watching a youtube video while scrolling through an article on CNN.  Not to mention all the fatty foods I'm stuffing my face with at the same time.

This is wasting my life.  

At the end of a day wasted on the internet, I feel miserable, depressed, anxious, and restless.  I fap to get that drowsy feeling that puts me to sleep.  

However, on days when I go to the gym, or go to a party, get some meaningful work done, eat clean, go out with friends, etc. etc., I feel uplifted.  I feel vibrant.  Like I'm sucking the marrow out of the bone of life.  Fapping is literally the last thing on my mind.

So I'd like to suggest a new approach to r/NoFap.  Instead of obsessing over nofapping streaks, or watching your progress on chains.cc, try to get off your damn computer and go out and do something.  Go to the gym, go to a class, join a club, meet people, talk to people, fuck people, read a good book, eat a good meal, take a road trip with some friends.  I guarantee you won't even be thinking about fapping.  Replacing [pornhub](/nsfw) with quickmeme is not a solution.    

I'm sorry for the the self-help style rambling, but hopefully this will help somebody.  I'll leave you with one of my favorite quotes.

It's the shitty stuff, the overflow of which desensitizes your brain towards actual pleasures. We hate the dopamine. We want to get rid of as many dopamine sources as possible, because that in turn will enhance our overall pleasure with simpler things, actually making us feel better.

But what about Oxytocin? It's what's sometimes called the love hormone. This is the good stuff, guys. It makes for lasting contentment and happiness. You get a bit of it from workouts, you get a lot of it from physical intimacy. 

And yes, you get a truckload of it from an orgasm. This is the stuff that makes you want to bond to your partner.

Now, what happens if you orgasm to porn? Yeah, you might already have guessed it. Your brain does the only thing it knows how to do. It bonds to the porn.

You are now stuck with an intimate fucking connection with your stupid porn, that you don't even like!

And this, my friends, is why some of us are having so much trouble deleting their porn collection - they are emotionally bonded to it the same way they would be to an actual partner. It's ridiculous. The shitty porn does not deserve such commitment. Get rid of that shit right now. Don't worry, the bond won't last forever, even if it might take a long while. Get that energy back, friends, free up mental capacity for actual bonding! It's worth it! You're worth it!

Edit: Wow, this thing blew way out of proportion. Guys, dopamine itself is not bad, it serves an important function. It's just when we overload our brains with excessive amounts of it that things turn sour and addictive. Also, nothing of what this post claims has been looked into by scientific studies of any sort. This is mere speculation extrapolated from my own personal experience and some basic knowledge on how the neurotransmitters work. Reality is a lot more complex than the simple model I posited, but it rings true for me and helps me explain my own behavior.

When I was a young boy, I discovered masturbating without realising what it was. I had a pet hamster when I was about 8 years old. I was a curious child by nature - I was curious about pretty much everything, including my genitals. One day I thought ""I wonder what would happen if I put my hamster in my underwear."" So I did. I would put my hamster inside my briefs and it would wander around trying to find its way out. The feeling of it wandering around in there set off earth-shattering orgasms, and while I wasn't aware of what was happening at the time, I knew that it felt incredible, and I began to do it regularly.

I now believe that this was what kicked my addiction into gear. A few years later I read about masturbation in a book, and tried it using my hand. Immediately, I was hooked. When I was about 12 years old my family got internet access, and I discovered pornography quite quickly. I printed a couple of images (one of Akira Fubuki that I still look at occasionally for kicks) and hid them in my bedroom, where I would masturbate for hours.

At the age of about 14 or 15 I developed a fetish for small penis humiliation. I believe this was sparked by my realisation that I had a slightly small penis compared to other boys my age. I would find girls to chat with on AIM or other online chat rooms and tell them that I had a small penis in the hope that they would humiliate me. I became utterly obsessed with this and did it every day, sometimes for hours at a time.

By the age of 18 I was masturbating several times a day. Since then, my addiction has got even worse, to the point where I have spent whole days masturbating. I often masturbate for an extraordinarily long time, only ejaculating after several hours. Occasionally I will masturbate all through the night without going to sleep. My record for a single session (i.e. one orgasm) is approximately 14 hours straight. I believe this is longer than the verified world record. On a recent business trip to a beautiful island I was given a nice apartment to live in on my own for about 5 days. I only had to work for about 3 hours a day, and I had the rest of the time free to explore the island by myself. But no; instead I chose to spend all my time in my bedroom, masturbating for days on end.

When I was younger I was content masturbating to still images of beautiful girls naked. Over time, my brain has become more and more fucked up, requiring me to use more and more extreme pornography to fuel my sessions. Last year I began watching a lot of extreme BDSM videos, like videos where girls were caned mercilessly until they bled. This has legitimately frightened me.

A couple of nights ago I fucked up big time. I recently discovered Tor and the deep web (thanks reddit...) but had never used it to look at anything really bad. On Wednesday, I used the Tor browser to browse some rather sketchy (but, as far as I am aware, legal) clearnet websites hosting jailbait-style images of non-nude teenage girls (perhaps 16-18 years old). It occurred to me that there would surely be websites on the Tor network that would contain similar images but with nude girls. I navigated to the Hidden Wiki and clicked the ""Jailbait"" section. Long story short, I ended up on a website that had child porn on it. A thumbnail gallery loaded, and while I didn't click on any of the images, I know what I saw. There were pictures of pre-pubescent girls (probably 8-11) engaging in sexual acts, both with other girls their age and with adults. I was horrified and got the fuck out of there immediately, cursing my stupid curiosity for getting me into such a ridiculous situation.

Since then, I have hated myself with a passion. I'm not a pedophile; I have no sexual attraction to children whatsoever. However, I still feel completely ashamed of myself and have been thinking about killing myself. Though I was using Tor, I'm terrified that the police will turn up at my door and my life will be ruined. I honestly don't know what to do. So here I am. I need to sort my fucking life out.

I'm actually a totally normal guy, for the most part. I was a straight-A student at school and I graduated from university first in my year. I know that I am considered to have an incredibly bright future. I have had several girlfriends (and have actually been able to sustain a healthy sex life with them, despite my masturbation addiction) and am very sociable and (I think) well-liked. But I need help, and I can't do it on my own.

My most recent girlfriend and I split up a few weeks ago. I dated her for a couple of years and we lived together, so this is a difficult time for me. Our breakup had nothing to do with my masturbation addiction, but it has caused me to look hard at myself. I don't like what I see at all. I want to be a better person and I want to have a healthy attitude to sex.

I don't believe that there's anything wrong with masturbating, but I **do** believe that it's bad to be addicted to it. I want to stop masturbating all the time, but I don't think I can do it. My head is all over the place. 

I'm sorry that this doesn't make any fucking sense. I know I'm rambling, but this is hard for me to talk about and I feel a little bit like my life is coming apart at the seems. Please, if you can, say something that might help me.

Thank you.

[EDIT: I am completely overwhelmed and genuinely moved by the amount of support you guys have offered. I can't even begin to tell you how grateful I am. I made this post pretty much out of desperation and without any real confidence that I could overcome this, but I feel like a different person now.

90 days ago I started this journey, I started this journey more then often and always failing at some point, resetting the badge time after time.

Now I finally can say I did it, although this is not an end, its just the start to a new way of life.

I found like so many of you awesome people, that the first half is the toughest.
I thought that this calm state of mind would never come but somewhere around day 45 the calmness set in and it realy was quite and easy journey from then on.
The crazy cravings, the blue balls and your mind telling you 'ah just 1 fap' all off that will go away and you can feel your strong brain, the real you, getting its power back and simply saying; No.

One thing I read when I started was all the 'superpowers' people gained.
Everyone is different, but I dont feel that different from before. 
There are some big changes but I dont see that as some massive superpower.

The biggest change there is;
Girls

They are everywhere!

One of the best posts I read from one of you guys said:
'its not that they started to notice you, its that you start noticing them'

This is true in every way, I never was a shy guy when it came to talking to girls but Im no cassanova. I would never flirt with a girl and would not know when one was flirting with me!

Maybe this is the only superpower Ive gained, picking up and sending out signals to girls.
Im 24 and in the last 6 years before nofap, I've slept with 3 girls...

During my short nofap period I talked to more strange girls then I ever did before, ended up with more new phone numbers then in all those years and ended up waking up next to a beautiful woman 2 times!
Both of them confident, fun and older then me, 4 and 8 years older.

I have no issues with age differences, I think its how you 'click' with each other that matters and not the age, but I think it does show that these confident woman found me attractive, something like that just didnt happen before nofap.

Something else happend, a (girl) friend of mine said to me after having a nice long talk with her; 'everytime I see you I get all fuzzy and warm inside' and made some obvious remarks she was into me. She is in a long term relationship with some guy and although Im not into her it sort of felt good to hear that.
Another experience that has never happend before nofap to me...

Besides the magnificent things that are called girls, I think the best thing is just the calmness in my mind.
No crazy porn thoughts, no shame after that one last fap and no need to clear your internet surf history!

I read that a lot of guys get super into new sports and hobbies and stuff like that.
I like just to continue living like I did, sure I picked up my guitar more and started exercising more, but thats a logical cause of nofap. 
Youve got to keep yourself busy and your mind away from that computer.
Once you get bored and youve got nothing to do, thats when the urges come.

So no fantastic new hobby, no massive abs and strong musscles, no meditation and zen master for me.
Just enjoying life like before, with a beer and my ps3 but now knowing there is a smoking hot chick waiting for me in the other room ;)

Good luck my interweb friends, just know it does get better.

Why do we fall?

What started as a quest to satisfy my now, ex-gf, had turned into a new foundation for a lifestyle worth living.

Nofap, is not a magic pill. It will not 'give' you any special powers or abilities. However, it is an experience that changes who you are, starting with the mind and continuing throughout the body. It rewires everything from how you become aroused to how you treat temptation and self-control. 

Like a muscle waiting to be worked, your mind is a powerful thing. It has the ability to dictate your willpower, ability to focus under stress, how your body reacts to sexual stimulus, and more. With nofap, you begin to realize how much of your life is not under your own control, but controlled by how you feel. We tend to seek comfort over discomfort, even at the expense of growth and new experience. 

When I first started Nofap, I was looking to increase my libido to keep up with my GF (at the time). I was not able to have sex much more than once or twice a week. I looked forward to watching porn as it fed my infatuation for women with big tits. It was a mental masturbation that I craved. It became more difficult to get hard-ons for my petite A-cupped cutie of a woman, despite the rest of her body being perfect in my eyes. When I began this journey in January, I encountered many failed attempts. Once I became single, I PMO'd for my last time, I had finally had enough.

I have experienced many ups and downs. Flatlines and Wetdreams being some of the most mystifying. I had wetdreams weekly, at random. I saw this as my body trying to continue it's previous ejaculation patterns of 1-3x / week. Over time the occurrences became less frequent. After about 8 weeks, my sexual craving had come to a calming stand still. Flat line was my fear. I was worried that My libido had dropped even lower. It wasn't until I had my first sexual encounter (8-10 weeks from start) that I realized I was more sexually charged than ever, and have yet to experience ED since.

I was able to fuck for 6 hours with short breaks every 60 minutes or so. Luckily I had been practicing kegels for 10+ minutes a day, 3x a week. Reading books on tantra had also helped rewire my mind's depiction of what sex is really about. By the time I had my first sex session since my breakup my fear of PE had been abolished! There were several reasons for this:

My sexual focus had been reoriented from mental to physical/emotional- meaning, instead of getting aroused at the sight of big tits, I was aroused by the ways my woman would communicate her pleasure. In other words, I was focused on HER pleasure, and almost forgetful about my own. Granted, I felt great, but watching her enjoy herself was so much more enjoyable than anything I was feeling. I believe this to be the masculine/feminine rolls at their finest. It was simply captivating.

2. I had developed the capability of literally stopping orgasms. After about an hour or so of sex, If I felt the urge to cum, I was able to squeeze my PC muscle so tight, It would literally bring and orgasm to a halt, or maybe just release a couple drops. AWESOME! 

It's fascinating. What I had interpreted as 'flatlines' was actually a redirection of energy. As if my body was giving up on sending energy to sexual craving and redirecting it toward other things I felt were more relevant in the moment. I was able to focus on my studies, art, and diet with much higher intensity and determination. 

When It came time for sex, I would be sexually charged by touch rather than a mental movie playing or mental antisipation. In fact, at this point mental sex movies are almost non-existent. Women are less intimidating because on some level I stopped viewing them as unattainable sex-objects and more like people- sisters, friends, mothers and lovers. I am able to speak with a woman and became aroused by her emotional expression rather than solely on her physique. Rest assured, I still get a jolt from how gorgeous they look, but there is no longer a perception that they are outside of reality, as they were in my world of internet porn. Porn made them a purely physical object that was outside of my personal entitlement, as are ferrari's, rolex's, yachts, etc. You'll never find me in a ferrari dealership, and you'd never find my flirting up a supermodel in starbucks. The fact that I could only view them via computer screen was building block to the version of reality that they are not 'real'-the idea that these things can only be found in movies, or video games.

Since my experience with nofap, I've come to realize that life is what make it, but only if you choose to create it. If you are constantly seeking comfort, you'll live a life of mediocrity, likely to be full of rich-tasting foods, sexual stimulation (from yourself), and mental masturbation (from your tv). What does that mean? you work, you get fat on the couch, and sex is something you hope happens, while you hopeless fall in love with every semi-attractive girl you come in contact with.

Since I've started nofap, I realized what it means to be dedicated. To overcome disabilities through practice and willpower, by breaking through discomfort and internalizing what it right by YOUR OWN STANDARDS, not the ones dictated to you by society. With this understanding, I've developed a lifestyle that revolves around health, fitness, sports, knowledge, art, and social success. All these things take blood, sweat, and tears, but the rewards are well worth reaping. For once life is finally worth every moment, but I'm not here to say that any of it was easy.

Nofap is a part of an awesome lifestyle. It provides a much richer experience than jerking it to midget porn ever could. You can kiss your sexual dysfunctions goodbye, although diet, exercise (kegels), and sexual habits all play their role. Find the depth in sex, and you'll find the depth in women. With an attitude of indifference and abundance real women will be able to flow through you life with plenty of pleasure to be had along the way (for both parties).

The nofap journey is an unpredictable one. It has it's rough patches, and fear of PE, ED, flatlines, and wetdreams, are all part of the process. TRUST in yourself. Trust in your nature, and understand when you remove the man-made poisons that are disrupting your natural experience of sex, your entire sexual experience will be revolutionized and reverted back to it's purest of essence.

Goodluck nofappers, a fulfilling life awaits you all.

TLDR: been around the block with nofap. It's good shit. Ask me anything!

1360553881.0,279,self.NoFap,18acvo,Your sexuality is your most powerful tool for self development (powerful analogy inside).,Self_as_object,316,37,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/18acvo/your_sexuality_is_your_most_powerful_tool_for/,"Here is a breakthrough I just had that I knew I needed to share with all of you:

As a man, my ultimate goal is freedom. Things like guilt, fear, and addiction are like slimy tentacles that hold me back from walking in the sunlight as the person I want to be. Everyone has tentacles like this grasping at them, trying to steal their freedom. 

When we are ensnared, the tentacles control us. The only thing that moves us forward is fear (not our own choice). So many of my ""successes"" were really motivated by fear of disappointing other people, or the fear of following my own path. 

Our willpower is the blade that we use to cut these tentacles from us. The sharper our blade, the more effortlessly we slice through the bonds that trap us. However, if our blade ins't sharp and well oiled, we have to hack away furiously to just get free from the smallest tentacle. So even if you can momentarily gain freedom, you are so exhausted from the struggle that you can barely get anything done before you get ensnared again. 

This is what has been happening to me lately. I've come this far (27 days) but I've been barely able to do anything productive other than avoiding PMO. I felt like it has robbed all my strength. What I've realized is that I've been working with a dull blade. 

This led to my epiphany that as a man, **your sexuality is a whetstone that can be used to sharpen the ""blade"" of your willpower.** Think about it, every time you get a sexual urge, you can use it to either dull your blade (PMO/lustful indulgence) or sharpen it (higher/pure expression). My blade's edge was basically round when I started this quest and repeatedly failed again and again, hacking away with little more than a broom handle against the tentacles of PMO. Each success exhausted me to the point where I couldn't fight the tentacles anymore and a future failure was inevitable. 

But each time I succeeded in overcoming that urge, my blade got a little sharper and was honed by the experience. My willpower went from a broom handle, to a butter knife, to the moderately sharp pumpkin carving knife that has gotten me to 27 days. Now, when I get through an urge, I have enough energy left in the tank to tide me over as my stamina recovers to the point of being able to handle the next serious pang of urge-i-ness. 

And guess what? Now that I know I've hit this equilibrium point, *nothing is going to fucking stop me*. I will use my sexuality to forge a massive two-handed greatsword of willpower. I'm going to slice through all the bullshit that holds me back and carve my way to my highest calling. 

*I welcome the urges now cuz I know these demons are just bitches I'm grinding to level up.*


**TLDR**

* PMO/Addiction/Fear/Guilt are tentacles that wrap us up and hold us back
* When we are completely wrapped up, the tentacles control us and our prime motivator is fear (not our own choice)
* Our willpower is a blade that we can use to cut through these tentacles
* If our blade is dull, it takes too much energy to cut through a tentacle and we are easily ensnared again (put back into fear mode)
* Our sexuality is a whetstone that we can use to either sharpen our blade (through pure action) or dull our blade (through giving in)
* As we continuously sharpen our blade, we can move out of fear motivated action (cut free from the tentacles) and venture forth into the world free to live our highest calling.

If you're going to give up fapping (and porn), it's inevitable that you'll get horny and get tempted to get back to your porn and/or fapping.

**This is just the problem - you're not comfortable with being horny!**

**For years, there was this release valve that you'd just turn and let your horniness wash out from your body. That's the biggest problem, you're just not accustomed to being horny and that feels very unnatural.**

But, that's also the best part. It's like swimming in the opposite direction. You're going against the grain and that makes you stronger. Ever wonder why all these people have all these new superpowers? Easy. By NoFapping, they essentially let themselves know that trying out something new isn't scary nor unachievable. 

**The thing that you should do is immerse yourself in it.** When feeling horny - go with it. Feel it. Experience it. Don't try to get rid of that feeling. Think of things that you always wanted to do and do them. Learn that new language. Learn playing a guitar. Fix that squeaky door. Clean your car. Run. Lift. Whatever. **Don't give in to temptation, let the temptation be a trigger to become a better you.**

**At the end of the road, you'll become a better person.** Horniness is going to become a part of you that'll allow you to do greater things. That'll be your secret - you'll always be horny but be able to funnel that energy into whatever is needed. 

**Always think of it this way - if I was able to go against something that was ingrained in my mind as completely normal by myself and everyone around me, I'll be able to move mountains.**

***That's your secret.***

**TLDR**

If you're doing NoFap (specially together with PornFree), you're going to get horny and have to fight with your urges to release it. 

That's because horniness is a new feeling that you've just been flushing down the toilet for years by fapping.

Something has to change,rhinogl,318,40,87,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1j9zi3/theres_a_beautiful_girl_in_my_bed_andive_got/,"I thought I'd share my story, sorry for the length but writing this has been cathartic. 

My story is no different than many other guy's. I started a little earlier than most maybe since my dad used to leave porn on Cable when I was around 4-5 and I'd stumble into it. 

Slowly over the years I started needing it more and more, the preparation for and just thinking about how great it's going to be to have a good fap would be familiar to any junkie. 

I hit a dry spell recently and haven't had sex regularly for probably over a year. Partly due to being extremely busy at work, but I'm sure my addiction has something to do with it. One night stands occasionally, sure, but I would be drunk so my inability to stand at full mast was excusable in my mind but I could always finish. 

Lately I've been seeing this new girl. She's fun to be around, sweet, and beautiful. We spend a lot of time together the past few days and she's so hot that I start getting aroused just kissing her in public. If I don't fuck it up we're going to have sex soon and it's going to be great. 

Then that day comes. We're at my place, things take that obvious turn. After about 20 minutes of foreplay she goes to put the condom on but I'm not really hard yet. No big deal, she starts to perform oral to rev up the engines, except the engine doesn't want to turn over. You think it's about to rev up any second but it flatlines repeatedly. I then realize what's happening, and of course that makes it worse. It's like a spiral. ""why is this happening?"", ""I haven't had anything to drink, this doesn't make sense"". ""What the fuck is wrong with me!?""

I guess she wasn't like the depraved videos I'd been watching to fall asleep most nights. They'd gotten increasingly weirder and the actual act had become impulsive. ""let's just get in and out of here as hard and fast as possible"" I'd tell myself. No joy at all.

Certainly she must have felt inadequate to some degree. That was nothing however to my deep personal shame over my impotence. I'd heard of NoFap before and had even read some but thought ""man those guys must have other issues, I watch porn all the time and can still have a functioning sex life"" Not anymore. I get it now. I'm all in. Hopefully this is my rock-bottom you hear about in most addiction stories. 

Thanks for the community guys, I actually feel like I can do something to fix myself now. I'm just hoping my ""performance"" returns at least somewhat after a week or so of abstinence or I really blew it with this girl if I haven't already. I'm still in it for the long haul though.

I first discovered this subreddit about a year ago and dabbled in trying to complete NoFap a few times but I was never truly dedicated.

When summer started, I decided it was time. Since then, I have failed *11 times* going **no longer than six days** at best.

I literally cannot sleep more than a few hours of half-sleep for the first few days and the cravings hit so hard and so suddenly that there have been times where I have relapsed or gotten very close before I even was able to remind myself that **I am trying to stop.** 

Anyway, this summer (so far) has not been a waste. I have learned what it is actually going to take and a few days ago I decided I simply won't allow myself to fail again. 

I have a few tricks I've been using to keep me on track. First, I told myself if I can make it 30 days (when I will be going back to school), I am going to build myself a gaming PC. I have always wanted to do this and for the first time in my life I am willing and able to do so. If I complete my goal, I am going to treat myself. 

Second, in the short-term, I have taught myself as soon as I have a pro-fap or pro-porn thought to tell myself ""THIS IS A CRAVING."" I was blown away the last few weeks at how well the mind can trick itself, and by reading up on withdrawal symptoms of nicotine or even harder drugs, this is a common thread. I thought that I would simply feel desire to fap after quitting, but in reality, your mind completely works itself around into whatever position it needs to in order to get what it wants (dopamine). 

Anyway, I feel confident as my third day winds down. I feel prepared. But I will no longer underestimate this beast as anything less than an addiction.

Edit: I'm really happy all the support I've gotten in this thread, and I hope there are others that felt motivated or fought an urge because of it. I know this time I will succeed in my goals, and I hope by this time next month I will be able to post a picture of my brand new gaming pc.

This is NO FAP. 

NOT ""No Wet Dreams"",   
NOT ""No Sex.""   
NOT ""No oral/handjobs.""

Reset your counter ONLY if you have MASTURBATED. Whether you jerked yourself off, used a fleshlight, fucked a sex toy or dry humped your bed. If you've single-handedly got yourself off, conciously and without any partners help, THEN you should reset your counter.

ANY OTHER REASON DOES NOT COUNT. 

So stop making post asking about whether or not you should reset. You know the rules: NO MASTURBATING.

EDIT: Let's clear something up: The point of the day counters is to count how many days you have gone WITHOUT MASTURBATING. This can range from edging to ejaculating.  
If you are going to reset your badge for silly reasons, you may never get past 30 or 40 or 60 or 90 days!!

also, user soverign5 has clarified my point a bit:

I put together a list of things that resonated with me and helped me understand how much damage porn can do. 
Not all the reasons are scientifically proven, and some may be a little out of the box, but you might find them useful.



**10 Reasons Why I Refuse To Watch Pornography**

1. The kind of porn that most turns you on, usually corresponds to a past negative emotional event in your life, and watching porn reinforces this problem. 

2. It gives you a fake impression of sex, creates intimacy issues with real people and creates sexual insecurities in the bedroom that will last for years. 

3. Porn is far more than a simple activity you just do. It affects your subconscious and all other parts of your life. The images of porn will be burned into your brain (because of the hormones and dopamine released) for years and even a lifetime. 

4. Porn forces you to objectify the opposite sex and think about sex more and more until it begins to take over your life. This, in turn, drives you to watch more porn. 

5. Pornography and masturbation are self-serving activities. Consequently they create a self-oriented sex drive, which inhibits our ability to give and receive love. 

6. By viewing pornography you are supporting the porn industry and helping it grow. You are also contributing to the sexual exploitation of the porn stars you watch. 

7. Looking at porn will put shame and embarrassment into your life, which will seep into other parts of your life. It may also force you to lie to people you care about.

8. Porn decreases your ability to get turned on by real women, which leads to a decrease in testosterone which leads to a decrease in muscle growth, drive and ambition.

9. Porn makes you a slave to your own cravings. This can lead to other destructive behaviours and negative emotions such as anger, shame, jealousy and sadness. It is easy to become enslaved by your thoughts and porn is a solid pathway to it.

10. You cannot lead a healthy life as a porn addict, with the images of porn floating around in your mind and warping your thoughts.

Hopefully, it will act as a reference for me when next tempted....

- It turns me into a zombie, who doesn't care about anything else. I forget things, avoid things, procrastinate, switch off from my wife and kids just to get some time alone with my iPad and to feed the habit.
- I have the most beautiful wife who, when fapping, I ignore in favour of much less attractive 'women' that I don't even know.
- It disturbs my sleep and drastically reduces the quality of my work and my ability to focus.
- it wastes time. My time, my wife's time, my kids' time. By fapping, I am therefore wasting my life and reducing the quality of theirs.
- it numbs me to the vibrant word around me that is full of genuine opportunity to grow, develop, achieve, help others, the list goes on....

So, badge reset....off we go again....wish me luck!

The word ""edging"" is just an excuse to masturbate without calling a spade a spade.

If it walks like a duck: you are doing nofap for all the reasons ""edging"" is wrong for you. It steals your time, attention, maturity, opportunities, not to mention it continues to regulate your risk/reward pathways.

We need to make it synonymous to masturbation, not a separate meaning.

Masturbation is an act that doesn't have to include ejaculation. They are separate phenomena. ""Fapping"", another crappy word, is essentially more damaging than orgasm. Fapping obviously is masturbation, but is that another immature term?

Wikipedia: Masturbation refers to the sexual stimulation of a person's genitals, usually to the point of orgasm.

That's exactly what ""edging"" is.

I haven't orgasmed from masturbation in more than a month or so, but I masturbated ""edged"" like crazy. Does me no good. I thought I wanted to regain my time, attention, &amp; ambitions … which includes that impossibly cute barista?

Here's what I've learned.,pseudohim,331,58,101,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/wp4ia/i_did_it_90_days_heres_what_ive_learned/,"Can't believe I made it. But I did. Ten years of addiction - done! I'm a different man now - - and here's what I've found.

**1. Masturbation seems pathetic and disgusting to me now**. It's very difficult to see how I loved sitting in a chair and wasting my time touching myself to pictures and videos of people I would never meet.

**2. It also seems second or third-rate.** Fapping to something is like trying to sate your hunger by looking at a picture of a steak dinner. It's a poor replacement for the real thing.

**3. Sexual desire is a form of energy.** When you turn off the faucet, the water has to go somewhere else. Stopping your PMO addiction is a fantastic way to lend inertia to other areas of your life. You'll want to do other things with your energy - get a different job, go to school, meet new people, pick up a hobby, etc.

**4. It shows you how dehumanizing objectification is.** Every single one of those people you fapped to has, or had, a real life. Dreams. Hopes. Desires. They called someone ""daddy"" or ""mommy"". They watched cartoons and went to grade school. They wanted to be something when they grew up. Once you realize this, it's very difficult to just see them as a sex object again.

**5. Stopping my PMO addiction has made me desire real love.** I was a sex addict. Most of the time, I didn't even want to. It was simply a habit. Now that I've quit, I want to find true intimacy with someone. I want to spill my soul into them and become one person with them...trust them with every fiber of my being, with every piece of my heart. Now sex seems like such a small, silly thing, compared to love.

**6. Seduction and /seddit people creep me out.** I used to admire and emulate friends who could pick up strangers constantly. That's a fine lifestyle for some folks, but not for me. It makes me sick to try and pretend I'm interested in a person just to get into their pants. I'll never do that again.

**7. You have tons of time!** Suddenly, hours of your life are yours once more. Seize them! Make your time work for you. Make money. Find a hobby. Join a group of people with similar interests. The days are longer when PMO isn't hogging your free time.

The last time I wasn't a PMO addict, I was in middle school. The years since seem like a nightmare. I will never go back. If this letch can make it, so can you! Keep fighting. Keep striving to better yourself. The trick is - the longer you stay fap-free...the less you wish to go back. Eventually you'll never care to again.

I wish that for each and every one of you. 

Thanks to all of you for being there, as a community. Having this place to come, to when I was weak or lost, was *invaluable*. Bless you all for helping total strangers discussing embarrassing things. Ha ha.

1351509715.0,273,self.NoFap,129qax,After indulging in nearly 1000 books and videos on psychology and motivation...I believe I've found the one discerning difference between those who make it and those who don't (as well as the most common motivational misconceptions)...[x-post from /r/GetMotivated],charismo,328,55,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/129qax/after_indulging_in_nearly_1000_books_and_videos/,"...and that is how they look at **expectations** (that is, there are **wishers** and there are **doers**)

Sorry if this is scattered, it's extremely difficult trying to summarize the premise of so many books...so I figured the easiest way is to look at 3 common goals that people have:

I want to get into a relationship.
I want to lose 50 lbs.
I want to be successful entrepreneur.

**For the 1st goal**

**A Wisher is**: someone who sits home all day (while asking 'why am I never in a relationship?) and only dreams about being with a cute girl. Blames the world/god/nature for 'bad genetics', perhaps says they're too ugly for someone ( despite evidence to the contrary where even unattractive people can get into relationships with people 'out of their league')

**A Doer is**: someone who doesn't separate people into leagues. See's a cute girl and knows she's attractive, doesn't deny it, but isn't intimidated (may say to themselves ""I'm suppose to be attracted to her, she's hot""). When he goes out to say, a nightclub, and *this is important*, does NOT make it a goal to ""get with a girl"", his goal at this point is to have fun. The saying in the 1902 book As a man thinketh described this well: ""Men do not attract that which they want, but that which they are."". Doers don't fantasize about being with cute girls, they expect it to naturally happen on its own.

**For the 2nd goal**

**A Wisher is**: someone who plans to exercise (tomorrow, on Monday, on New Years day, etc), tells all their friends, takes all the before pictures, and fantasizes about fitting into those jeans. When an obstacle hits (from cravings to plateaus) they seek external motivation. Temptations overpower them, not always, but usually. Their ""metabolism sucks"" and ""they've tried every diet to no avail""

**A Doer is**: someone who plans to exercise (today), snaps a few pictures to track progress, doesn't need to tell anyone. Doesn't think 6 months down the road, nor do they buy those jeans they plan on fitting into it. Goals are set in days, weeks at max with a simple ""Am I losing weight?"" or ""Am I not losing weight?"" - like a self-guiding missile, if they are losing weight they don't change anything, if they aren't, they find out what's going wrong. Plateaus, craving, temptations **are EXPECTED**, but they are constantly reminding themselves of how bad they feel when they indulge. When they do give in here and there, they remind themselves they're human and immediately go back on the diet. Each day is a step in the right direction.

**For the 3rd goal**

**A Wisher is**: someone who says 'some day', or ""once I get this taken care of"" or ""I need money"" or [insert excuse here that stalls]. They are motivated by fear, ""what if's???"" invade their mind constantly. They always change their 'idea' to be 'as unique as possible' and fear competition, fear losing money, and fear rejections. Perfection is what they aim for, always, even if it means stalling the best test of all: the market itself.

**A Doer is**: someone who wants to be successful (financially) but isn't motivated by money, is in it the for long haul. His idea isn't 100% original because most ideas aren't, they just take a certain concept and feel they can execute it better (**the idea is 1%, the execution is 99%**). Instead of dreaming of being rich or riding in their Lamborghini, they see business as a game; the funniest, greatest, most amazing game to have ever existed. Perfection is impossible thus no aimed for. Competition is a great as it means there exists a market and the hard work (that is, testing to see if a market even exists) has been done.

&gt;I believe the 2nd goal can successfully apply to NoFap. 

**tl;dr** In other words, **successful people don't dream or wish or waste time fantasizing**...that 'dream' is nothing more than the direction they want to move. The secret is waking up, day in and day out, and making everything they go for in life a certainty, not a fantasy. That every roadblock is part of the bump in the road, and that self-confidence is the greatest and most effective tool at accomplishing ANYTHING, bar none. Successful people, whenever they catch themselves dreaming, STOP and think how they are going to get FROM where they are TO where they want to be, then DO IT

So here 'tis:

Get rid of ambiguity. What are you trying to accomplish and what are the 'slippery slope' behaviors that lead you to engaging in the behavior? So for me No Masturbation, Porn, Drugs and alcohol are my bottom lines. My slippery slope involves isolating from friends and family, telling lies, arguing, browsing the internet aimlessly, working too much, playing video games too often, overspending, overeating, too much TV and more. In short anything that leads me to numb out or forget who I am and what I am about needs to be watched closely and checked in with my recovery buddies.

This gives me a potential heads up for when things are going to get rough. 'Been playing video games for too long, gonna be dazed and confused and maybe a little ashamed of what I haven't accomplished when I stop. Be Ready.' This lets me recognize what pushes me to my violate my bottom lines and gets rid of the BS 'I don't know what happened. All the sudden I was looking at porn and tapping' voice in my head that like to play helpless in the face of my addictions.

Make a list: Bottom Lines (those things you will not do anymore) and Slippery Slope (Behaviors that are red flags and lead to you violating your Bottom Lines.) Until it is written down my addict brain will pretend it doesn't really exist. I have to write it down.

Fapping is a lot like gravity. You don't know anyone who is really not under the power of it. It controls us. We can't get out of the cycle of gravity because it is always pulling us down. 

Why leave planet fearth when everyone else is here? They doesn't seem to be anything wrong. But there is. We can't stop it. The idea that because everyone is under the influence of it does not make it right.

Don't EVER say to yourself ""Well, I already messed up today, so it doesn't matter if I do it again today."" THAT'S BULLSHIT! I would tell myself that all the time and make no progress. If you're going to make any progress then you need to stop masturbating now, and not fifteen minutes from now when you feel like shit AGAIN. 

More fapping=More Dopamine-
More Dopamine=Harder to quit. 
This is science fapstonaut, and there's no excuse for breaking you streak, even if its less than an hour long.

Now get back on the saddle. You've got a lot of work ahead of you.

Stumbled randomly unto an old PC hard drive hidden away at the bottom of a personal box that probably has not seen the light of day for ten years.  

Magically the disk still worked.  Unfortunately it contained tons of XXX hard core porn and twisted perversion intermixed along with sentimentally valuable long lost family vacation, weddings and family reunion type personal  family photos either saved from emails or taken back in the late nineties-2002 with our first digital camera.   

I knew right away that my wife would be delighted to have those family photos recovered and saved off to a DVD for safe keeping.  But that would mean wading carefully through a minefield of hidden porn folders from my decades of personal fetish porn collection dating back to the days of dial up BBS.  

I stumbled a couple of times today but I did not fall.  It was strange to experience how quickly a couple of wrong double clicks onto some of my favorite fetish .jpg's could instantly set my heart racing and my dopamine receptors into overdrive.  Even six months ago the briefest exposure to that type of material would have triggered another relapse and a drawn out PMO fest.  

Today I employed my self control to stop myself from looking further or relapsing and focused instead on saving  the good photos and trying to avoid stumbling onto anymore of the bad.   

The ""Healed"" feeling came after the family photos DVD was created and tested.  Without any further hesitation I used a ten pound sledge hammer to destroy that old hard disk into a thousand pieces right there on my garage floor. 

So TIL that I still cannot control the instant dopamine rush that those type of photos will give me and perhaps I never will be able to.  

But nowadays my life is so much better in so many ways and with so much more to look forward to that I know better then to ever allow myself to give into the temptation or to even want that stuff lying around.

1357484457.0,260,self.NoFap,1628p6,Obligatory 90 day tale of change.  ,GBvitaobscura,311,51,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1628p6/obligatory_90_day_tale_of_change/,"A little bit about myself: I am an 18 year old male attending community collage.  I started PMO when I was 11 years old.  

Looking back on it all, I was addicted from the start, but I did not come to realize my problem until a few years after I started PMO.  Around age 13 my dad found out that I was watching porn, and he tried to help me stop the only way he knew how, by putting content blockers on our computers at home.  I love my father, and he has been a huge help in my life, but how naive he was to think a porn blocker could keep me out!  I won't go into details about how I did it, but circumventing the software was pathetically simple.  

After that my dad never found out about the porn again, and life went back to ""normal"", but there is a catch.  As we all know here at /r/nofap (and /r/pornfree) addictions grow.  By the time I was 15 I'd become a depressed, self-loathing, and hateful individual.  What the next two paragraphs have to say is horrible, and I will carry the weight of these memories to my grave.  

I hated who I was.  I hated that I could not gather enough courage and strength to stop my PMO addiction.  I tried to stop more times than I can remember,  perhaps more than 50 times I tried.  The longest time between relapses was one week.  During this stretch I thought I might have been able to beat the PMO, but I broke down on day 8 and binged until my penis was bloody.  This is who I was.  On top of the addiction I became extremely physically sick.  At one point I had to receive multiple emergency blood infusions to keep my heart from stopping.  

I was a wreck in every way.  And I helped kill one of the only friends I ever had.  This friend came to me asking for help, I knew he suffered from extreme depression, and he needed someone to talk to, but I told him that life is shit and nothing matters.  He ran his car off the freeway later that night, a clean cut vehicular suicide.  The next day when I talked to his girlfriend she told me what had happened, and I laughed.  I laughed when I learned that one of my only friends in the world killed himself.  

It is impossible for me to put into words how disgusted I am with who I was.  The old me was a monster.  I am honestly surprised I never raped or sexually assaulted anyone.  The only thing holding me back was shame.  The one thing I held onto was my desire to please my dad.  I did not want him to know who I was on the inside.  I went to church every Sunday and Wednesday, I talked the christian talk and acted like I was fine.  I became an amazing liar.  I could get anything past almost anyone.  During church I would sit and look at all the hot high-school girls around me.  I would sit there hiding my erection as I fantasized about these girls.  

This hell lasted for a few years until one day I decided to kill myself.  I knew I was sick in the head, but I did not want help, I wanted an end to the pain, shame, and total self hatred.  But I could not go through with it.  I could not even bring myself to end myself!  Do you have any idea what that's like?  Being so totally controlled by your own body that you can't not even destroy yourself?  And so at age 17 I allowed myself to be a slave to my body.  I created a schedule: 
Wake up, go to school, come home and watch porn for half an hour, do homework, eat dinner, play video games, watch porn until I got too tired to continue, go to sleep, repeat.  I became a robot.  Following the same schedule... day after day.

Well, something weird happened about 3 months ago.  Some random dude I had never met came up to me and changed my world.  He talked to me, made me feel like I had worth and he asked me questions.  Now,  to all the liars out there, you know that a question is very dangerous.  If you don't have the right tools in place and a proper cover story, a simple question can ruin everything.  Well, when A (my new friend) started to ask me questions... I felt too tired to come up with a good cover story.  So I told him the truth.  The next day, he introduced me to a friend of his, K.  Well, K is the most amazing girl I have ever met in my life.  In one moment I felt like something in my mind just snapped.  I knew that I wanted to date this girl, but I also knew who I was.  So I went to war.  I deleted all the porn off my computers, I got honest with a few fantastic older guys I know, and I removed every source of temptation from my life.  I decided for myself, for the first time in 7 years that I would do what ever it takes to make myself a better person.  The rest is history.  

After 90 days of absolutely zero porn of any kind (not even playing video games like skyrim), no masterbation, no edging, and nothing even remotely sexual in any way, I am a new person.  I have changed from the deepest part of my being.  Nothing is the same.  I used to lie to anyone and everyone about anything, now I can't get myself to say anything dishonest, even if I wanted to... I just cant.  Also, I have self confidence.  Prior to October of last year I had only one friend, and we rarely hung out.  Now, I have a core group of four friends who I would do anything for, and I am making new friends everywhere I go.  This sounds silly, but the world is a beautiful place!  I always walked around shoulders hunched and head down.  Now I make eye contact with everyone and maintain perfect posture.  I have girls telling me that I look good, and some people who knew the old me don't recognize who I am anymore.  One guy I have known for a few years had no idea it was me when we chatted yesterday!  I used to have horrible acne, no style, no personality, bad hair, and no ability to change who I was.  Now I look in the mirror and I like who I am.  I still need to gain a bunch of muscle mass, but other than that I am one sexy beast!  Finally, I have drive.  I will gain 25 pounds of muscle this year,  I will get good grades in school,  I will memorize a 1000 word poem by the end of next week.  Not because I need to (although the grades I kinda do need), but because I want to. 

So, moral of the story to all my brothers and sisters who take up the fight, if I can do it, you can do it.  Seriously, if the fucked up piece of shit that I used to be can change, you can do it too.  Now, the first thing you need to do if you want to start this journey is to get yourself a friend that you know you can trust, and lay your situation out to them.  YOU WILL NOT win this fight if you do it all on your own.

Yet, after 26 days of not looking at two dimensional women while furiously pulling on myself to the point of oblivion, the phrase, 

‘Stop Or You’ll Go Blind’ has taken on a whole new devastating meaning. 

Looking at a computer screen and jerking off to the digital ghosts of women makes you 

**Blind** to so many deeply important elements of life. 

For instance:

* Your ability to control your self, to respect yourself and to look someone in the eye with pure love instead of being riddled with shame. 

* Your ability to begin experiencing peace, joy and stillness without looking for it outside yourself.

* Your ability to explore the profound value of discipline.  

* Blind to the score of women all around you all the time that hold your gaze and then sneak a look at your package while passing. 

* Blind to the delicate contours of nearly every womans emotional (her present self) and physical health (her tremendous body). 

Right now, the thought of washing and massaging a womans feet is to me now *Highly Erotic*. 

Just seeing a woman remove her bra in front of you feels like a lightning bolt of pleasure coursing through your rib cage. I could never use condoms because they spelled instant ED for me every time. Now, they are essential.

When someone uses your computer, you know you’ve got nothing to hide. 

The same goes for your consciousness, you have nothing to hide - so approaching women and regular people is easy, as it always has been, you were just blind to that because two hours ago you jerked off to a 2D Sascha Grey clip on your faptop.

There wasn’t a single time, in the thousands of times I PMO’ed in my life that I did not feel ashamed. 

What was I ashamed about? 

I was diminishing the value of women and therefore myself. 

I was letting the women in my city down and therefore myself. 

I was going blind.

It’s so easy now to see the vacant look in mens eyes everywhere, the sadness they carry and I find myself wanting to promote nofap to passersby's everywhere. 

I feel rejuvenated and powerful and I’d be interested in a study that examines the spike in depression as directly linked to broadband access to porn. 

Stick with it and you'll find out how easy it is not to. 

It now reminds me of playing with G.I. Joes for hours, at some point it's something you just drop. 

Don't let the women in your life down! 

Give them your whole self and discover a new level of ecstasy together! 

She deserves it!

Reflecting on the past year has put much into perspective. Thanks to occasional journal entries and posts to this forum, I can see both my growth and my shortcomings, my aspirations and my letdowns. Most importantly, this type of perspective gives me intuition into what type of goals I should set for the future and how to conduct myself to achieve them.

I’m writing here today to share with you what I've gotten out of it so far, what I have not gotten out of it, and what my experience-adjusted goals for the future are. 

**One Year Ago**

To give you an idea of my progress, I’ll summarize where I started.

I cut out masturbation a year ago at age 22. I was a college dropout living at my parents’ house, I was getting paid poorly for some part-time remote web consulting jobs, I was in a draining relationship with a needy girl, and I felt a general sense of boredom and lacking. I’d get off to Internet porn 4 to 7 times a week, and have sex about half as often. In bed, I’d sometimes go limp during and have to stop. I didn't really think it was an issue because it didn't happen all the time.

I joined NoFap not because I thought my porn habits were a problem, but because I felt directionless, stagnant, and as if I were becoming complacent with my mediocre situation. I knew NoFap wouldn't be a magic bullet when I started, but it felt like a “first step.” I just needed some direction to move in, to see where I could go from there. Anything was better than wasting my early twenties in my parents’ house with an unstable job and an unstable girl.

**What I've Done**

Briefly and chronologically:

* I left the consulting gigs and got a real internship.
* I moved out of my parents’ to the city.
* I dumped the needy girl and started playing the field.
* I re-applied to college and was accepted.
* I met a smart hottie and started dating her.
* My internship offered me a full-time job.
* I turned down the job offer to go back to college, where I am now to finish my undergrad.

I don't attribute these events to abstaining from masturbation. NoFap helped catalyze them though -- especially the women-related ones. Here’s a deeper look.


**General Physiological Changes**

The best way I can describe what I've given myself by not fapping is a mild discomfort in my stomach and chest (like “butterflies”). It grows when I’m not accomplishing things, expressing myself, exerting my body and mind, being social, or leading. Sorry if this sounds a little eastern.

I’d previously get this feeling only rarely, and usually when I felt threatened or embarrassed. I thought it was a bad feeling. I’d suppress it, thinking I was taking the “high road.” I'm convinced that my numbness from a year ago was largely due to my automatic suppression of this feeling. 

Not jacking it made that feeling so strong I couldn't possibly suppress it all with my mind. So I followed advice I read on this subreddit: I (clumsily) ran, did push-ups, and focused on hobbies. I started making music again, writing, and throwing myself out there at parties more.

Somewhere along the line I realized all that is the point. Suppressing that light stomach-chest feeling feels like fear. Channeling that feeling into whatever I choose is exciting, empowering, and gives me focus.

**Vocal Changes**

There are a lot of excitable guys in this subreddit claiming miracles. But the change in voice is real.

Not only is my voice a little deeper, I wield it with more articulation and precision. Listening to and practicing some of the material in Roger Love's Vocal Power helped. I have less stress and tension in my body, so my vocal chords are more relaxed and able to speak with ease.

I've been putting my voice to use recently. I was asked to announce a large annual regatta, with 3000+ attendees. I did, and it led to plenty of compliments and an offer to announce an even larger one. I'd like to develop my voice and public speaking more. I'm thinking about joining my local chapter of Toastmasters International to do so. This is something I probably wouldn't be pursuing if NoFap hadn't let me see this skill I have.

**Creativity and Spontaneity**

I picked my music back up, and have been working on an album due out whenever I feel like it. I started writing a blog about my university that’s gaining popularity (and authors) on campus.

I second-guess myself less. I've found my first thought is usually right. And when it's wrong, I can correct myself with grace. One trick I've been actively practicing is just saying a thought out loud as soon as I have it. No thinking about saying it, deciding if I’m going to say it, or waiting for the moment to say it. This might be contrary to the popular advice “think before you speak”, but when I do it, I often find people agreeing with me. Maybe that advice is just for those prone to poor wording.

**Sex**

In my [Six Month Report](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/t3pbi/6_month_report), I mentioned that my problem of occasionally going to half-mast had decreased from once a week to once a month or so. Now, I can say that I never have this problem.

I have sex only with my girlfriend, and it’s still exciting. I've pushed her for a threesome, which she’s tentatively agreed to. She understandably has reservations, which I hope to assuage. I probably never would have even asked if I were still watching porn.

And just to cover all the bases, what I mentioned 6 months ago holds true: my stamina, passion, ability, and virility in bed have increased tenfold since starting this journey.

**Women**

My buddy and I were drinking some beers and cooking some t-bones. At a silence, I told him “I'm jealous of you, man.”

“Why's that?” he asked.

“Because you're single. You can have sex with any girl you can charm and seduce. We're at college, and all the benefits of bachelorhood are yours.”

“Yeah, but I’m jealous of you” he responded. “You have a smoking hot girl with an amazing personality who you can bang any time you want, without working for it.”

After a moment's contemplation, we clinked our bottles and moved on to something else.

That conversation has probably played out millions of times, but it's a perfect anecdote for my dilemma. Sure, my girlfriend has an amazing personality. She’s in love with me. She’s got my back and is always there when I’m down (or otherwise). Plus, my buddy wasn't lying about her looks. I got her with energy and drive that NoFap helped provide me.

Maybe it’s a grass-is-always-greener situation. But I miss the titillation of meeting new girls and seducing them that I was having closer to the beginning of NoFap. So much that I flirt with other girls as much as I can without hurting my girlfriend or making her jealous. It’s still not the same though. Believe it or not, I actually miss the surge of having no sexual release for four or more days.

I feel like I'll have to make a decision before too long: I'll either end things with this amazing girl because I’m young and desperately want to feel the intensity of being a completely free man; Or I'll make a bigger commitment to her, have a stable loving grounding in my life, and always wonder if I settled.

NoFap has helped keep my relationship vibrant, but it has also kept me looking at other options.

**Men**

I've noticed for the first time other guys looking up to me and watching what I do for guidance. It’s led me to a leadership role on my sports team at college. It’s extra pressure, but instigating camaraderie in others in worth it. I’m more outwardly focused, which projects confidence. I find it easier to relate to other guys and build friendships. It’s just a matter of willingness to do so, which I have more of now.

**The Future**

NoFap is here to stay. Porn and masturbation are out. I like who I am now a lot better than who I was a year ago. I want to continue to improve myself in all aspect of my life.

I didn't meet all the goals I laid out for myself after starting NoFap.

I didn't “become a force” in my company during my internship, but I left a good impression and accomplished several large projects.

I didn't “make the most of city living,” but I moved to the city, explored some nightlife, and made some friends.

I didn't build the huge entourage I had envisioned, but I expanded my social circle and made connections.

I didn't achieve a zen-like clear mind, but I'm generally more purposeful and decisive.

In another year, I hope look back on my personal growth and again see obvious improvements. NoFap is clearly part of a balanced and accomplished life.

I may not have become the impregnable force I had hoped for, but I've improved myself gradually and distinctly in so many ways.

Here’s to always doing.

My wisdom. ,Superfluity10k,320,63,105,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/16gdzz/89_days_tomorrow_is_90_my_thoughts_my_experience/,"I found NoFap while surfing reddit about a month into my redditing career. I've been a redditor for 11months and its taken almost a full year long to hit 90 days. I was a regular 2-a-day-PMO career porn surfer for over a decade. Death Grip. No sex drive to real women. Sex was scary - I can't hold an erection. 

I relapsed countless times on my way to 90 - you may also - just stick with it. 

Its worth it. 

Since my last relapse (22 day streak) I decided I was ready for 90 and nothing was going to stop me. I quit PMO but not looking at women entirely - I still subscribe to GW and felt I needed to see some tits and ass to keep me sane - even if it meant not acting upon it. 

*You don't need to go cold turkey from looking at women - you just need to go cold turkey from acting upon your urges.* 

Since I set off on this journey I have found a new fulfilling job (maybe career) in sales and am a much more positive and outgoing person. I am connected to myself and understand the needs of others.

Around day 70 I started to tell people about my NoFap instead of hiding it away - specifically 2 women. They were in awe over it and didn't believe me but they realized I was not joking. I remember my long time friend said* ""... I dont know whats changed but you are so much fun to hang out with lately.""* - Thats when I told her. She was floored and didn't understand it but eventually realized it was working just by the way I was acting, a la ""I dont give a fuck.""

She has told her friends about me and they all say ""Really? No way..."" She insists its true and they then tell her its incredibly hot - which makes me feel even better. 

I feel confident in every part of my life. I hooked up with my ex girlfriend (she knows about nofap and is now 50 days no schlick) and she doesn't refer to it as ""morning wood"" - yesterday she asked me how my ""morning steel"" was. I could beat her dead with my cock. 

Literally. 

For those of you struggling just keep with it. A relapse is not something to be down about - My journey has been filled with failure but I made it. I'm 20hours away from the top of the mountain. 

To put things in perspective-

I can fap now. And be done in 30 seconds.....

Or I can resist, become a man and own my life. 

60seconds*60minutes*24hours= 86,400 seconds in a day. 
Which = 2,590,000 seconds in a month. 
Which =7,776,000 over 90 days.

Why throw away 30 seconds of death grip porn for 8million seconds?

If someone told you you can have $30 dollars now, or $8million dollars in 90 days what would you take?

Thats how I feel. I'm fucking worth $8million dollars and every second I don't give in to temptation makes me a richer person - I understand my self, my soul, who I am, my principles, and who I want to be. 

I only have one life. Why not enjoy it?

NoFAP is the definition of #YOLO.
You only live ONCE.  Why have sex with yourself when you can get bitches, get money, and become the envy of other socially awkward penguin and career PMO'er?

I now notice other people who were once like I was and it makes me smile - A.Beacuse I am no longer them.
B. Because its so god dam simple to fix. 

I salute all of you.

1344507159.0,253,self.NoFap,xxlg2,A cautionary tale from someone about to turn 30,,303,50,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xxlg2/a_cautionary_tale_from_someone_about_to_turn_30/,"Hi, 

I discovered NoFap just a few days ago, after stumbling upon the TedX talk. Anyone who may be be unsure about NoFap: Heed my cautionary tale. 

In a few months I'll be turning 30. I've been addicted to PMO for about 10 years. Each year my PMO addiction worsened, my life got suckier. 

From a young age I fapped. I fapped even before I really understood what I was doing. But because I'm old(ish) I didn't have a high speed internet connection as a teenager. I had dial up until I was about 20. And even when the early high speed connections came along, there wasn't the vast vast amounts of free, extreme porn that is available today.

But I digress...

In a 7th grade I finished with straight A's in school, and was made dux of my school. 

By the time high school ended, I had failed a couple of subjects, and barely passed the rest. 

When I think back to my life at age ~20, I had a curious confidence about me. Despite the fact that I was very very skinny, I stuttered, I was a bit short, and never had a dollar to my name - I had at least half a dozen girlfriends between the ages of 19 - 23. I had a certain 'happy-go-lucky' attitude. I wanted intelligent, creative, nice women. I didn't really care about cup size. 

Of course back then, my PMO addiction was only just beginning to come about.

At age 20 I wrote a novel (being a writer is my life's dream) - it was shit, but hey I wrote a novel. I also drew, wrote songs, played in bands...

But things got worse. My PMO increased (although I didn't realise I had a PMO addiction, or that such a thing existed). Not a single one of those relationships worked out. The sex was usually terrible at first because of ED, then they got OK for maybe a month, and then they always went sour after that. 

But no doubt you're sensing a pattern of decline here.  

By the time I was 23 I had dropped out of uni. Twice. I had no girlfriend, no degree, a dead end part-time job I hated, and I was probably a borderline alcoholic. 

Over the next 7 or so years things just got worse. I went three years without so much as a kiss. *Three* years, not even a kiss from a girl. I never went back to uni. I never found a good job. I hated going out. I would look at girls with a weird kind of anger and hatred. It hurt me that I couldn't have all of them, whenever I wanted. 

I craved intimacy less, but extreme sex more. I wanted a blonde fake-titted bimbo that'd let me... well, I won't go into details. 

I started fapping to more extreme porn. Things got worse. I became weird and reclusive. My stuttering got worse. My life was an absolute mess. I was so lonely, but I never once made an effort to meet anyone new. Any minor opportunity that came with a girl (very rare) I blew due to severe social anxiety. 

All this time I blamed everything I could - my heavy alcohol drinking, the city in which I lived, my insular group of friends. Bad luck. But all that time, ticking along in the background, getting worse and worse, was my PMO addiction. 

Finally things got so bad I just had to get out of there. So at age 26 I went backpacking around Europe for 4 months, on a shoestring budget. I backpacked around Europe for 4 months without so much as a kiss from a girl. Outside of that it was a great experience: but I always felt like the weird reclusive one that didn't belong. Girls seemed to treat me with a sense of caution. Like something wasn't quite right about me. Paranoid, perhaps. Or maybe there really was something there. 

After several years of anger, loneliness, backpacking, and PMOing until my arm hurt - I met a girl. We had an awful 18 month relationship while I was living overseas. We virtually never had sex. It took several attempts before we actually successfully had intercourse. I blamed issues with anxiety. Which was in part true. But looking back.. yep, you guessed it: porn induced ED.

So maybe she wasn't my soul mate, but it could have at least been an OK relationship. Or something. Instead, I fapped constantly and never had sex with a girl who was there, ready and willing. Basically I made both our lives miserable. 

Now I am 29. I re-enroled in uni last year, and failed about 50% of my subjects. After taking six months off, I begged them to let me back in. I was on anti-depressants for about two years, but recently gave them up in favour of natural remedies. I started exercising, using light therapy, getting Omega 3's and a bunch of other stuff - all of which helped. 

But there was something missing. 

I have no doubt that most of my sad story of decline is *directly correlated* to PMO addiction. At 29 years of age, I am in a worse position than when I was 20. I am still stupidly skinny, I still stutter, I am still flunking higher education and I still don't have a dollar to my name. But to add insult to injury, I'm also old.  

As it turns out in about 90 days I will be turning 30. Just in time for a 90 day reboot. 

And I am at day 5!

TL;DR --- I am three months away from turning 30. I have fapped my life away. I have nothing: no degree, no money, no girlfriend, virtually no happiness. 

**Don't turn out like me**
**Don't turn out like me**

But you know what? 

I am optimistic about the future.

I slay one last demon, and ride off into the sunset. 

Best of luck Fapstronauts!

I present to you: The Game-Changer.",roeko,300,49,129,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fkktd/today_is_my_cakeday_one_year_ago_i_joined_reddit/,"Hey all. Since today is my cakeday, and this is the subreddit is the reason I joined Reddit, I felt that I needed to share something useful with you guys.

A little backstory: next month I'll be 25 years old. I started fapping when I was 14, and know the damages of porn and masturbation since I was 17. All these years I wanted to quit, but just couldn't manage doing it.

I've been through all kind of addictions: video games, cigarettes, weed, alcohol. I'm handling a deep depression for years, and let's say the army service didn't help. And although I have depression and anxiety for years, I was able to kick every single one of my addictions....except one. I couldn't get over fapping. 

Even when I was in the Army (and military prison. shitty times) I couldn't help myself get over this addiction, and since I started masturbating, my top record is 14 days. it was 5 years ago.

I joined nofap a year ago, but it changed nothing. reading all the tips and guides couldn't help me get through one week. I couldn't understand why others could easily go through a couple of weeks, while I couldn't barrel through 3 or 4 days.

Porn is the perfect drug: if you think about like every other substance, you realize a couple of crucial things: 

1. In order for a drug to function, chemicals in the drug need to fit in your brain. If we take weed for example, it only fits our brains about 15% (No one knows the exact number, it's a rough guess). Heroin fits our brains about 60%-70%. Because of evolutionary reasons, porn fits our brain 100%. 

2. It's so common that it's not only socially acceptable (which is insane, if you ask me), it's EXPECTED. Can you imagine expecting your kids to use heroin? well, in some period of history, heroin was used as a medicine. it was acceptable, common, EXPECTED. crazy, huh? is it crazier than using a drug that fits your brain 100%?

After truly understanding the effects of porn, I had a clear goal: I wanted to quit. But after all these years of trying, what else could I do? But then again, I couldn't give up. I just couldn't. I hate the fact that unregulated media streams and inadequate educational systems could mold me into a person I don't want to be.

So I kept on reading and searching for ways to overcome my addiction. I subcribed to a website called [Fight The New Drug](http://www.fightthenewdrug.org). a few weeks ago they sent their subscribers a free book about getting out of the addiction. I haven't finished reading the book, but I already extracted the most useful weapons and ways they suggested in order to handle urges. I wanted to share this extremely useful tactics with you guys, because after all these years, this is the only thing that helped me. I sincerely hope it'll do the trick for you too.

Since I'm not sure I can legally copy and paste the material in the book, I will find similar material on websites and write my own view on the subject.

So here is it:

First, realize that no one can go through it but yourself. Actually, more in general, no one will ever, EVER, see the world from your eyes. You're the only one who's gonna go through this, and no one can do it for you. And as Churchill said: if you're going through hell - keep going.

**1.Learn the addiction cycle.** Our brains are ubiquitous - they're practically the same, and it's the same cycle in every single one of us. [Meet your new wallpaper](http://aftercareemailservices.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Cycle-of-Addiction-image.jpg). Read it, learn it, memorize it. That's what happening again and again and again. On every arrow, you have an choice: continue running down the path, or break it. paragraph 3 will explain on the best weapon you can use to break the cycle. P.S. Consider ""Desire to escape/Triggers"" as ""Entertaining the idea of using"" - all the ""if I only do this.."", ""It's the last time.."", etc.

**2.Be mindful of what's happening in your body and brain:** what phase of the cycle are you on?

**3.After you understand where are you on the addiction cycle, do the S.T.A.R:**

**S.** Stop what you're doing. hands to the sides, eyes to the nearest wall. Fixate on a point in the wall.

**T.** Take 5 deep and long breaths. Watch as your lungs filled with fresh air. Relax. You are not your thoughts.

**A.** Ask yourself: what do you REALLY want to do? is it worth it to risk what you really want for what you want now?

**R.** React. The wheel is in your hands. You're the one in control. You're the only responsible man. Act like it.

Do the S.T.A.R right now. Do it as much as you want, whenever you want.

**4.Replace the act with something else:**

**Meditate** - it will change your perspective on life. it will help you understand that you are not your thoughts. you are not your addictions. you are not the voice that tells you you suck. you are not your past.

**Exercise** - it will use your energy for good causes.

**Socialize** - you'll find that you're far less anxious as you were when you kept fapping your life away.

**Eat** - Look up at nutrition. Learn about how the food industry is a lot like the porn industry, and how it turns pain and suffering into profit using billions of dollars in advertising and lobbyism. Consider going Vegan. [Take the red pill!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-F8whzJfJY).

**Stop smoking weed.** stop doing the half-ass shit your friends do. You are not your friends! [This](http://youtu.be/CcrhwatDkUM?t=7m16s) is the video that made me realize a lot about what I do in life. I recommend watching the whole video (It's also quite entertaining).


That's it. This is the method that gave me the power to go through 16 days without fapping. 

One last thing I would like to talk about is superpowers. A lot of fapstronauts talk about expecting superpowers. So, regarding superpowers - there's only one unpretentious, self-doubted thing I can tell you: Your Mileage May Vary. 

Everyone's different. For me, when I was fapping away my energy, I used to be anxious all the time. I had anger explosions, uncontrollable cries and sleep disorders. I couldn't care less about my life.

So in my case, I do consider the changes I had because of nofap ""superpowers"": Didn't cry all day? shit, that's a superpower. I can actually go outside my house? that's a superpower. I started exercising - that's a superpower. Slept only 6 hours a night and feel energetic? that's a superpower. I even made up the courage to approach a girl in a pub - that's a HUGE HUGE HUGE superpower for me (even though the approach was a bit cold, I was so proud of myself I slept with a huge smile all night). 

See, understanding, and of course deeply and unconditionally accepting where you are in life and who you are (not anything you can think of, by the way. humans don't have the power to really understand who they are. it's just our ego that tells us we can) is the first step to taking yourself further than you ever thought possible.

I hope it'll help you as much as it helped me. Have a nice day, and be strong folks!

* Edit: typos

* I forgot to add one thing: it gets better. Here's a metaphor: think of your ability to stop yourself from harmful actions as a button. at first, your button is very very small, so it's hard to push it. Every time you realize which phase you are on the cycle, and using the S.T.A.R method to make the right choice, the button gets bigger. The next time you'll get an urge, it'll easier to push the button. over time, the button gets so big, that at times of urge you'll have the ability to kick it away quite easily. that's because our brains can change, and so is your will power.",,False,,t5_2skrn,1370256169.0,,month1,True,t3_1fkktd,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fkktd/today_is_my_cakeday_one_year_ago_i_joined_reddit/,

It appears that as this sub has grown we are facing new challenges in keeping us united. Our newest controversy seems to center around religious views, so its time we, the moderators, made our unwritten policy on religion written. Please observe the new information in the sidebar and quoted below. 

&gt;r/nofap is and always will be an inclusive subreddit. That being said, please refrain from posting things of religious or non-religious nature unless it relates directly to your motivation behind overcoming a masturbation problem. If someone mentions how religion, or non-religion has helped them overcome their addiction you are not to criticize their support. If you want to debate religion invite the poster to go over to r/debatereligion and have fun there. Its not that we don't want religious discussions to occur, but we would like to keep our subreddit united. We are here to support each other fight porn and/or masturbation not each other; try and remember this.

We are trying to maintain a community that is very different from the rest of reddit. Many threads in other subs will bring up fapping in the first few comments...we are not them. Many subs will have people from various religions attacking each other, we are also not them. There are people of many different faiths, religions, spirituality, or even a lack there of. Let's put that aside and focus on the real issue here quitting masturbation. 

As moderators we are going to start removing comments that attack another religion, or is ""overly"" religious. While your mod team is also comprised of many different faiths, including atheism, we will try to remain as impartial as possible in this process. If you feel you are being attacked or a redditor is trying to convert you with overly religious material please report the comment and more importantly message us so we can take action right away. If you feel a moderator has improperly removed a comment, please report the mod to the other moderators so we can review the comment removal. We are always open to suggestions and we'll take your input here, the mods are here to server you, the community.

But I'm 35 and just like you. Socially awkward, lacking ambition, diminishing libido, and I LOVE(d) PORN. It allowed me to be with any woman i wanted, at anytime. 

But in the last few years, my life has fallen apart, and I believe part of this is due to porn/fapping. I never understood why I could not get respect from my bosses, co-workers, and industry, and I have come to the conclusion that a lot of it leads back to my porn addiction. 

I tried NOFAP for the first time, lasting three days earlier this week. I got a lot done, exercised, etc. But then I went out on Tuesday and met a busty groupie chick, who gave me her number. Got home, had a few drinks in me and busted one out in the bathroom over her Instagram account. The next day, went on a total binge, fapping three times, then fapped every day since at least once. 

So tonight, after a saturday of getting nothing done but playing video games and fapping, I decided to read posts over here. I got really inspired and decided to start a reboot again. Then my copy of **** *** **** finished downloading. I opened it for a quick peek. Got really horny and started to go at it again. Finished up, felt awful. Then I decided to delete the file.


And then I decided I should delete all of my porn. 


Everything, dating back to some ripped cybersex CD-Rom files from 1994. Keeping all my porn on an external hard drive, I went to Disk Utility, selected the drive, and hit ""erase"". Years of collecting were vaporized in an instant. Not pausing, I pulled the drive out of the docking station without powering it off. The bulky drive was still spinning. Out of it's dock, it started rotating, almost doing figure eight formations in my hands. I couldn't tell if this was a result of the pornocide I just committed, or if the drive was still spinning. The effect made me dizzy. Wish me luck.

On the surface we've given up class structures, and we like to think we've got equal opportunities and have a right to free speech and full participation in society. But actually in our overcrowded, media-sedated, materialistic, and ultra-competetive world, that 'land of the free' is in many ways a kindergarten myth. 

Basically, just to stay afloat and have anything resembling a 'real life' with freedom and happiness, you need to man up, work like a mule, and suffer with a smile on your face. We all have a sense of what a real adult is, and in our more reflective moments we sense how far away from that ideal our present condition is. This 'growing up' is what our natural survival instincts - the ones we develop during puberty - are for: to help us reach full manhood. All those hormones and chemicals that mature us give us a drive, a feeling of longing that basically amounts to the double edged sword of instinctive/sexual motivation: ""here's your secret energy - it's powerful, deadly stuff, could get you into trouble, but you can use it to strive towards achieving your goals and reaching your potential"". 

But we've grown up sheltered by messages telling us life isn't a struggle, and adult life is a big baywatch/hollywood party where you do a little work - nothing too serious - and the wads of cash and supermodels in bikinis start falling out of the sky. We don't want to face the truth that human life is a struggle whose basic principles haven't changed much in hundreds of years. Here are a couple of those principles: 'if you want something you gotta work hard for it', and 'if you want something that's out of the ordinary for a guy of your background - you better work 100 times as hard'. One difference is that in the past resources were typically so limited you had to work hard just to *survive*. Instead of simply starving, or maybe earning the status of 'village idiot' or 'vagrant', being a kidult today means you're allowed the external illusion of a normal life... but will it last? What's underneath that thin veneer of contentment?

So what about all those chemicals floating around our bodies - all that instinctual/sexual energy? If it doesn't get used to drive us towards our goals, and instead stays in our system, it feels uncomfortable. Something just doesn't fit, doesn't feel right, after a while you feel like to explode. The energy has to go somewhere, and if it's to make something useful or creative then you'll need to apply effort. But that's what we're trying to avoid because of our whole fear-ignorance complex. So then conveniently enter the clever little suppression mechanisms - the ones that let us stay in our childhood cocoon, coast along and just about get by (in our fantasy... while in reality we fail slowly and bitterly). One of those sly mechanisms is masturbation and porn fantasy. It's a way of spending the sexual energy, using a fantasy world construction that others have cynically made for you, and hey you can feel good as long as you don't think too deep about it.

The result? You neatly get put in your place in society, a place determined by externalities rather than your wishes and dreams, the place of a coaster. Coasters sink and continue to sink. This works for the society as a whole: you're just a consumer, a beta-male, inconsequential. You won't rock the boat and you won't use up alpha-males' valuable resources (jobs, fame, attention, women, money). And the tragic part is that it also works for you, or at least part of you, the part that doesn't want to poke his head out of his burrow hole, that wants a nice cosy life, being cared for and sustained by others' work, just like being at home with mama.

**The moral of the story: if you want a real adult life, don't fap. Face your instincts and deeper feelings that you've been ignoring since puberty. They are like a double-edged sword, it can really hurt you, but you will learn to use it if you decide to accept the challenge and strive towards real life.**",,False,,t5_2skrn,True,,month1,True,t3_r50o6,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/r50o6/fapping_as_a_means_of_denying_adulthood/,

My goal was to break ED and to break the awful PMO daily cycle, which dominated my life. I have done it!

However, this next run will be even greater than before. I will reduce fondling my junk, refocus my nofap efforts and double my will power.

NoFap may not change your life, but it has changed mine. Everything started at the end of last term. My GPA was sitting at a nice 1.8, I was 30 pounds overweight, addicted to porn, and playing at least 5 hours of league of legends every day.

I said something to myself that I may not recommend to anyone else, but surprisingly enough it motivated me.

I promised I would kill myself.

I said I would give up every vice I had, I would sacrifice everything in this world that I not only hate about myself, but that limits me. I would give them up for one quarter, 3 months, and see what I could do.

I stopped smoking, I stopped gaming, and I started working out.

But it wasn't until I found NoFap that I actually made the connection. 

I had gone to a reunion for some of my old High School friends who all talked about how well they did in college and how not only did some of them have jobs lined up, but some were even starting businesses. I sat there, a failure, only halfway through my quarter wishing I would just drop dead on the spot.

And then New Years came around. I went out with some friends and expected to try to hook up with some girls. Unfortunately I learned a lot about my friends that night and a lot about myself. After DDing all night and going from shitty bar to shitty bar, I wound up having a conversation with my friend who just wanted to leave to get high. I asked him ""Would you rather take home a girl or just get high?"" 
""I'd rather just go home and get high. That's not weird is it?"" 

I went home that night, and at 2am I fapped to God knows what, and afterwards I remembered those words. I then remembered something more important, NoFap. And January 1st, 2013, I made the final step to change my life. I quit fapping.

Since then, it has been terrible, rough, hard, but fun. I got straight Bs this quarter, better than I've ever done. I've fucked my girlfriend so much my dick got raw. I lost 20 pounds. I'm doing it guys. I'm getting there. 55 days, here's to the last month of my journey. And cheers fuckers, because why not get drunk on Spring break?

Self-confidence comes from the *knowledge of being in control*, and that means being in control over yourself more than anything else. That's why it's impossible to fake it - if you can't trust yourself to do the right thing, you'll never have the resolve to reach your full potential. You need to prove yourself to yourself with actions. You can read every motivational book and article ever written and it will not make a difference.

It's also the reason why NoFap has such a far-reaching effect for many people. It's a great foundation for building achievement on. Once you've conquered fapping, nothing else seems difficult. You know you can handle it. You know you're strong.

Perhaps it's also why women love confident men. They just can't afford to become involved with undependable losers.

Edit: Just in case someone thinks it's empty philosophy, the realization came when reflecting upon the past 10 days or so: I've been feeling a sudden surge of confidence unlike anything I've had before - effortless, natural *aplomb*. It seems that in every challenging situation I just think about NoFap: ""Whatever happens, I'm the guy who, when his balls and brain felt like they were about to explode for hours on end, resisted because he chose to. I'm a winner."" I've never been so proud of myself, and I'm proud of each of my fellow nofappers. We choose the harder path.

Our excitement and enthusiasm during our coitus would obviously not have been as prevalent if I had masturbated excessively.

I'm very glad I didn't think about resetting the day prior to today in order to last longer; lasting long proved to be not even the slightest concern.

I'm very proud to say this has been my first ejaculation all year, and it's also been the first time I've orgasmed with the help of someone else. I was much more impressed with this experience than any porn I have ever seen, or would have ever seen.

I would like to thank all of you from the r/nofap and r/pornfree community. Without our experiences and stories being shared, our motivation and inspiration to each other, and our commitments to better ourselves, this challenge would be a lot more difficult.

Refraining from sexting and downloading porn.
The tube socks were stashed in my dresser with care,
Not a single load would be blasted in there.
And as I was tucked quite tightly in bed,
Random nothings abounded inside of my head.
The past few days I had felt like crap,
But nothing so bad that would induce me to fap.



When all of a sudden I heard a loud bang,
My neighbors next door were doing their thang.
Their moans did compel me to dig out my flash,
Open the folders and run through my stash. 

Four gigs of pure unadulterated bliss,
[Pussy] (/nsfw) and [ass] (/nsfw) and glorious [tits](/nsfw).
Next door the moans and the creaky, squeaky bed,
Swelled to a crescendo like my southernmost head.




The sounds of their passion consumed me like fire,
Tortuously they stirred up my most secret desires.
And just when things seemed they could get no worse,
My neighbors sang out like a chorus in church:



""Oh Baby! [blah blah blah] (/nsfw) with a miniature tuba,""
""And go [blah blah blah blah blah] (/nsfw) like a German in Cuba!""
To which her lover did aptly reply,
""[Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah] (/nsfw)
with a fresh banana cream pie.""



Once, twice, and thrice as they came,
My hand would not aide me in doing the same,
Instead I parted with my secret stash,
I deleted it all and emptied the trash. 




The suitemates next door could not make me to break,
They had simply reminded me what was at STAKE.
Was a few minutes of beating my bone,
Worth another day/month/year of forever alone?




Yes, every day is like a merciless war,
For one to live freely and jerk it no more,
So to all of my fapstronauts who have chosen to fight,
Happy 90 to all and to all, goodnight.

The No Fap Hoax

TL;DR

YBOP, TGPE, and nofap are founded on the views of two people who are considered pariahs within the sex and relationship research and clinical communities. They present themselves as experts but aren’t. There’s no empirical research evidence to support any of the claims made by YBOP and TGPE. All the claims about negative effects of internet porn use can be better accounted for by other explanations. Watching internet porn (hopefully ethically produced!) and masturbating are not problematic for the vast majority of people. And for those people who do have a problem with internet porn, it’s almost always a sign of some other underlying problem (shame, anxiety, fear of rejection, relationship problems, boredom, low self-esteem, lack of good sex education, etc.). Addressing those underlying problems should be people’s focus, not abstaining from masturbation to internet porn.

LONG VERSION
Before I get into the problems with YBOP, TGPE, and nofap, a bit about my background to show that I have some expertise in the area. I have PhD in psychology and have studied human sexuality extensively. I’ve published several first-authour papers in reputable peer-reviewed academic journals such as the Archives of Sexual Behaviour and the Journal of Sex Research. I teach a class on human sexuality at one of Canada’s top-ranked universities. I’m also part of a global email listserve that’s populated by many of the best minds (i.e., researchers, theorists and clinicians) in the field of human sexuality. YBOP, TGPE, and nofap have all been discussed extensively on the listserve (well, mostly criticized and ridiculed, largely because Marnia Robinson takes every opportunity she can to spam the list with her claims). So I’m not just another internet hero who thinks he’s boss when he’s clearly not.

On to YBOP, TGPE, and nofap…

This whole movement stems entirely from the work of two people: Marnia Robinson and her partner Gary Wilson (R&amp;W). They are on a crusade against internet pornography. Wilson is a high school science teacher and adjunct instructor at Southern Oregon University, and Robinson is an ex-lawyer who is now a sex and relationship therapist. Neither one of them have been formally educated in research or clinical psychology, and neither one of them have a PhD (i.e., they’re not Drs.). YourBrainOnPorn.com is a pet project of theirs, tied into talks, books, articles, and Ms. Robinson’s therapy practice (Reuniting.info). They run YourBrainOnPorn.com. Wilson is the presenter of the TEDx talk, “The Great Porn Experiment”. R&amp;W regularly blog their work online at “Psychology Today,” which is a non-academic magazine, although I’ve heard rumblings that their gigue may be up. Robinson is also the co-authour of “Cupid’s Poison Arrow,” a non-academic book about her views on sex and relationships. Their website, the TEDx talk and their publications give them a veneer of scientific expertise.

If you do some digging, you’ll find that the links (not people’s personal blogs) in the reddit/r/nofap FAQs are all from the same source: the work of R&amp;W. There’s a reason why there are no other sources – no experts have bought into their theories and viewpoints. R&amp;W have a history of manipulating and/or misrepresenting research findings to support their ideology and claims, ignoring studies (and parts of studies) they’ve cited that contradict them, discussing indirect evidence as if it’s direct supporting evidence, and citing bad research.

R&amp;W are pariahs within the world of sex research and clinical practice. I’m not being an intellectual snob (or at least, I hope I’m not); it’s just that what they’re claiming is completely unsupported by research. This is not to say that they’re trying to deceive people. They clearly believe the ideas they’re promoting, and that they’re making the world a better place. And who knows, perhaps future research will prove them to be correct (I doubt it).

R&amp;W make a litany of claims about the harms of internet porn use. I’ll address a few of the most egregious ones in an effort to keep this short enough that people will hopefully read it. Keep in mind, though, that NONE of R&amp;W’s theories and claims are supported by any peer-reviewed research. It’s all simply speculation presented as fact. They’ve also made what’s considered the gravest error in the research world – interpreting personal anecdotes as empirical evidence.

DOPAMINE AND BRAIN RE-WIRING
Dopamine plays a central in role in the neural networks of the brain that respond to reward. All rewarding (i.e., pleasurable) experiences are associated with increased dopamine activity and increased activity in the corresponding regions of the brain. These experiences can be anything pleasurable for the individual. Neuroplasticity (or re-wiring, as R&amp;W call it) is a phenomenon that occurs all throughout life, although brain development slows down as people enter into adulthood. All our experiences can potentially cause re-wiring, and our wiring influences the way we experience things (i.e., it’s a two-way street). This is a good thing.

The reward system has been the focus of much substance addiction research and many people have claimed that behavioural addictions have the same underlying neurological causes/effects. Within the larger research community, however, there’s still no consensus on so-called behavioural addictions having long-term effects on brain functioning, similar to what’s seen in substance addictions. Many people are very skeptical of behavioural addictions in general, such as internet addictions, sex addictions, porn addictions, etc., as there simply isn’t any strong evidence to show the same degree of brain changes that are seen in people with substance addictions. There are some addiction organizations in the states that equate behaviour and substance addictions; however, this doesn’t represent the views of the entire mental health/medical community.

The most important point, with reference to R&amp;W, is that there is NO evidence whatsoever that watching internet porn causes detrimental changes in the dopamine-reward system (i.e., their whole re-wiring hypothesis). R&amp;W have simply extrapolated from animal models of substance addiction and sexual behaviour (e.g., hamsters, sheep, rats, etc.) to humans watching internet porn. A great example of this is in the TGPE video. Wilson claims, “At the same time, other physical changes in the brain make it hypereactive to porn…”. There is not one single study that has shown this! It’s simply speculation presented as fact.

INTERNET PORN CAUSES MENTAL DISORDERS
In the TGPE video, Wilson states that internet porn use is associated with various clinical disorders including ADHD, depression, social anxiety and OCD. He opposes the prescription of medications to treat these disorders and states, “Guys don’t realize that they can overcome these symptoms simply by changing their behaviour [masturbation to internet porn].” As someone trained in psychology, I find this extremely problematic and entirely unethical. There are literally piles of peer-reviewed research showing that people with mental disorders and/or other psychological problems will often self-medicate with rewarding behaviour or substances. This is at the core of addiction. In other words, the rewarding behaviour (in this case masturbation to orgasm while watching porn) allows the individual to escape from the symptoms caused by his/her mental disorder or psychological problems. There is NO research showing that internet pornography causes mental disorders – none. It’s the other way around – psychological problems and mental disorders can lead to problematic porn use as a means to cope and self-medicate. Wilson is simply presenting his ideology as fact, and in this case, it’s dangerous. People should be seeking treatment for their mental disorders.

Hint: it's not about sex.,1_player,285,43,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/170dms/the_most_important_benefit_of_nofap_hint_its_not/,"I'm 9 days in, the last 6 months I've tried NoFap and relapsed countless times but this time I'm in for good because I understood what pressures me into jumping the bandwagon again.

Many reports talk about getting it on with some cute girl, being more confident and more ""manly"" but NoFap teaches you something far greater: **drive and resilience**.

I don't actually know the causes behind this, but it is pretty consistent with my experience and many other fapstronauts can agree with me. When you stop that dangerous habit for some time, your way of dealing with unpleasant and stressful things (chores, making a big decision, etc.) is radically different. Let me explain with an example:

* **Random LetsFap day:** ""I have to wash the dishes... I don't feel like it, I'll do it tomorrow"" and the circle of procrastination starts, and the guilt and anxiety of having something to do starts to grow in yourself.

* **Random NoFap day:** ""I have to wash the dishes.. that's boring.. well **fuck it, let's do it anyway**.""  This attitude is the most important thing in your life.

When you fap you exchange 30 seconds of pleasure for anxiety, guilt, and an oppressing sense of ""I want to change my life but I'm stuck in the same place"".

Learning to say ""fuck it, let's do it anyway"" will enable you to procrastinate less, be more happy with your life and feel more driven to actually suck it and combat for the things you want.

I am here to learn how to be a man and own my masculinity, not become anything to suit what may be most effective in picking up girls. Women like confidence. But if you pursue the attainment of that confidence with a motive to impress women then it is a hollow, mechanical confidence that could eventually eat you up and make you shallow and miserable. Addiction to fap is one removed from an addiction to women and notably, their attention. For me this is a major trap and and a HUGE distraction. Nofap is taking me on a journey to the self, where I am finding ecstasy in other areas of my life. Women are not the answer to our dreams guys, however alluring and sensually provocative they may appear. Addiction can go to unforeseeable levels of consciousness. I am tackling this one head on, but others may see this as going too far. Don't get me wrong, sex is great and women are a special part of life.

Anyway, so I feel that I need to give all the credit to NOFAP.  I have SO much energy and like I said, it's kind of ridiculous how far ahead I am at work.  So I decided to take this energy and REALLY GO FOR IT.

I APPLIED FOR A JOB THAT I WAS SEVERELY UNDER-QUALIFIED FOR.  

I had all this confidence and gusto and so I then just picked up the phone, called them, and spit venom into that motherfucker.  I told them of every single accomplishment that I could think of.  I wouldn't stop until they made me.  They asked me to come in for an in person interview.

I did and started all over again.  I told them of how I'm doing now and what I can bring to the table and expanded on stories of when I proved my excellence and all that good stuff.

I thought I killed it.  I walked away thinking YES!!  I NAILED THAT INTERVIEW!!  I'VE GOT THAT JOB FOR SURE!!

I started planning what I was going to do with 50% more money coming in every week.

They said that they would call me the next day.
I didn't hear from them.
I called them about 4:30 PM.

They said that they have decided to pass on me and instead have selected other more experienced candidates.

THIS IS WHAT I SAID.

What?  Are you serious?  You can't be serious.  There's no way.  That's impossible.  I would love to see who these candidates are because there is no way that they are any better than me.  No way.  Not a single one.  I've always done great in sales.  I'm at the top right now.  Not the top 10%.  The top 5%.  I'm the best.  There isn't anyone better than me.

He said, ""Yeah but what were you selling before?""

I told him.  It's not even worth mentioning because it is such a trivial item compared to what I would be selling.  Night and day.  Not enough experience means not enough experience.  Different widget.  Different animal.

I kept going.  I wouldn't shut the fuck up.  I went on about the other more complicated things that I was in charge of.  Things that were under my control.  If this motherfucker was going to push me under it was going to be after the biggest, hardest bone-crushing beatdown of a I-ain't-got-shit-to-lose-and-I'm-taking-you-down-with-me-you-little-bitch-match he ever came within earshot of.  

He said, ""Well maybe I can talk to my superior and see if we can get you in the next time when we do another round of hiring.""

I wouldn't accept it.  I was going for broke and that was the only deal that I could see in my head.

Not a chance I said.  I want this job and I want it now.  Didn't I tell you about the time that I overcame........

This went on until he said, ""Ok well let me see what I can do.  I'll have to give you a call next week.  Good enough?'

That works perfectly.  Thank you and I hung up.

They called today.

Yeah- that's what's up.

It can make you want less. 

I'm done with being satisfied by fake stuff. I want to be satisfied by the real thing now, and every day of frustration is going to be worth it.

You are wrong. Porn and masturbation are part of the problems in your life, but they are not the only problem in your life or the cause of all of your other problems.

Social anxiety is not caused by PMO. It could be exacerbated by it, but PMO is not the cause. Your problems meeting girls or keeping a relationship are not caused by PMO, they are exacerbated by PMO, but  PMO is not the cause. Your inability to relate to women, your weight problem, your inactivity, your lack of ambition, your inability to get over an ex-girlfriend, etc., are not caused by you looking at naked people and touching your penis.

NoFap won't fix everything in your life. NoFap will help you stop looking at porn and masturbating. Your sexual function will improve. You might spend more time doing other things, rather than sitting alone looking at porn. That's it. It's not a panacea, it won't fix your whole life.

If you're fat, eat less. Go to /r/fitness and read the FAQ. Read *Think and Grow Rich* for help on improving your life in other ways. Start practicing a religion again if you think that will help you. Don't just make a list of what you don't like about yourself, make a list of how you'd like to be and work toward that. The same way your brain doesn't know the difference between pixels of naked women and real women, it doesn't know the difference between how you act and who you are. If you act a certain way, your brain assumes that's who you are. Act more confident, your brain thinks you're more confident, and it makes you more confident. You can't fix everything this way, but try it.

I'm in my forties and I assessed my life and didn't like what I found. I had a hostile relationship with my wife, my kids thought I picked on them, I was fat, I cursed all the time, I was angry, I watched a lot of porn and masturbated, I would sometimes hope I'd die soon, I didn't believe in anything anymore, I had no hope for the future.

Now the positives: There is absolutely nothing special about me. I'm about average in every way. But I decided to change things in my life. I stopped cursing, I stopped verbally attacking my kids, I control my temper better, I don't blame everyone else for my problems anymore. I lost thirty pounds and have kept it off. I converted to Catholicism, I improved my relationship with my wife, I'm on my 90th day of no PMO. I haven't fixed everything in my life and I can still improve in many of the things I listed, but I've solved or nearly solved a lot of the things that screwed up my life and who I am. I have work to do, but I also have hope for the future again.

Don't blame porn and fapping for all of your problems and the condition of your life. It's something to be fixed, but it's not the only thing. If you don't like who you are, change who are you are. It's easier than you think. NoFap can't fix your life, I can't fix your life, a therapist, or girlfriend can't fix your life.

From reading this subreddit it's very easy to spot a common trend amongst the big majority of NoFappers. Everyone who took some time and invested some energy in this knows the *entire theory* behind NoFap, right? They know the why and the how behind the entire idea. But it's glaringly visible that amongst the 60k users here, only a small minority succeed in completing the 90 day challenge and truly are committed to NoFap. The big majority is what I used to be like:

Knows that NoFap is right, yet they keep relapsing and telling themselves they'll eventually do the damn thing and hook themselves off the addiction. But they won't. Just like a smoker who throws away his cigarettes and then digs through his garbage to get them out because they desperately need a hit of nicotine. 

Why does this happen and how to finally succeed?

**Part 1 - Complete understanding of the NoFap idea and an understanding of your motivations**

I'll make this easy for myself and just point you to this link:

**http://www.young-goddess.com/**

Don't worry, it's not a porn site. Ok, it *was* a porn site. It was posted in this subreddit a while ago. The owner of the site made a complete 180 and wrote out a *huge* essay about NoFap, sexual energy and celibacy.

Read the entire text carefully and you **will** completely understand the entire idea behind NoFap. 

And when you understand the idea, if you have half a brain and common sense, no offense, you'll find the reasons to do NoFap and you really should have an intrinsic motivation. It is an incredibly written text and covers male sexuality in a way never seen in modern society, the true way.

**Part 2 - Conquer your mind, conquer NoFap - consciousness and awareness**

After step 1, you should have enough motivation built up inside you not to struggle for the first few days. Many people may struggle from day 1, but I firmly believe that step 1 should put you in such a mindset that the first few days will have you excited not to fap, and you wouldn't do it even if you had porn playing in front of you.

Then what happens? The early motivation wanes, It happens quickly, a few days is usually all it takes. You see a hot picture, have a sexy dream and all of a sudden, you're relapsing. 

It feels fucking great.

For the first minute or two. That's the sudden onrush of missing dopamine caused by too much masturbation and then a sudden cessation of the practice for longer than what your brain likes period of time. 

Then the dopamine stops rushing. It flatlines. It stops feeling good mid-fap. You eventually orgasm.

Regret ensues.

**How to avoid this?**

Remember, it all starts in the mind. I will list two rules below. When I say rules, I mean it. You **have** to follow these 2 simple rules if you want to succeed with NoFap:

1. Do not, in any way, shape or form, touch yourself sexually. Not even a little.

2. Do not look at porn, hot images, images that are subtly sexual. Just avoid focusing on anything sexual if it's not a real woman in real world which you're able to talk to and connect to like a normal fucking person.
**Note:** Don't even fantasise in your mind. Just don't.

**What about sudden rushes of urges and dopamine, what do you do when you enter ""the haze""?**

What is - ""the haze""? It is a state of mind in a male, when he is aroused and thus the primary task for the brain and the body is to impregnate the female because ofcourse, that is our main purpose in this life. The animal can't think rationally and succumbs to his biological urges which is to achieve orgasm and reproduce as fast as possible.

The ""haze"" is very powerful but since we as humans can think and are a bit more advanced than animals, it's safe to say that you can master escaping it every single time.

I recommend **[The S.T.A.R. Method](http://i.imgur.com/LX4QG7U.jpg)** 

**Part 3 - How to ""orgasm"" with NoFap and make it a natural part of your life (forever)**

If you follow the above two rules and completely avoid any sexual stimuli which isn't a real woman you will have
huge amounts of pent up sexual energy in you. Which brings us to this:

**[Sexual Transmutation](http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm).** 

Read it, learn it, use it. Thank me later. 


It's important to be conscious and aware of potential triggers and situations. It's important to be able to predict, react and stop. Use your sexual energy and transmute it into anything other than the empty act of fapping. Your life will improve tenfold.

What do I mean by ""orgasming"" with NoFap?

Well, the problem many NoFappers have is that NF seems like an uphill struggle. It's hard, it's long and there doesn't seem to be an **actual** end or a finite act to all this such is the orgasm to the Fap. The only ""ending"" is the made up number of 90 or whatever days. That doesn't even make sense. Why do the 90 days struggling and then what, get back into the habit of fapping 3 times a day and get back to being a human zombie?

That's why we use Sexual Transmutation which you've read up on.

**Read slowly and carefully:**

The urge you feel when you are horny and want to fap/have sex is **NOT** strictly the urge to cum. It is not an urge to have sex or masturbate.

***You don't need to have sex or masturbate ever again in your life and you'll be just fine.***

But what is it then?

Despite not needing sex/fap and being completely fine without it, there's one thing you can't avoid.

**You have to discharge your sexual energy through an outlet.** Be it sex, fap or (you guessed it) transmuting your sex energy into football, painting, music, whatever art, hobby or sport you're into, the sexual energy *MUST* be discharged.

As the text says, if it's not discharged, it will force it's way out. (read: ***relapse***.)
Through sexual transmutation you achieve ""orgasm"" by discharging your sexual energy without actually losing your vital life force on nothing and bombarding your brain with mind shifting dopamine from porn.

You still get horny, then you ""fap"" by discharging your sex energy and ultimately you are sexually satisfied.

 *Does it sound familiar?*

Well, I've run out of things to say. This is it from me. I didn't talk about benefits, E.D., this or that...this is a pure guide on how to succeed in NoFap. NoFap is a continous process and as such it has to be managed, otherwise you will fail.

Final note:

People forget. Write out a few hard facts from what you've learned today and read them every single morning to yourself. Be conscious, be aware, never let your guard down.

1341369385.0,241,self.NoFap,w0g78,I didn't FAP for over 100 days.  What I learned....,ScottishB,289,48,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/w0g78/i_didnt_fap_for_over_100_days_what_i_learned/,"I was able to hold for a little over 100 days, and then I, unfortunately, relapsed.  If my badge says 130 something days, please ignore that.  I have sent the request in to have my badge reset.

The reason I am creating this thread is that I'm hoping it can be used for informational purposes to those struggling with pmo addiction and or ED.  I could write a book on my experiences over the last four months, but in light of the FRAT factor, I'm going to do my best to make this an exceptionally abridged version (I'm afraid, though, that it will still qualify as FRAT).

First and foremost, I am 30 years old and began fapping at about 12 years of age.  I began fapping regularly to hardcore porn at about 22 years of age and kept that up through age 29.  At or near my 29th birthday, I began experiencing ED issues with women.  Some of these women were exceptionally attractive, and despite the fact that I felt intensely aroused and into the experience, my penis would be small, shriveled, and, in that moment, essentially useless.

I began NOFAP and made my goal 90 days.  I ended up making it just past 100.  I can say that it is not easy to make it to 90 days.  It takes a full on commitment.  If you are going in even 90 percent committed, you should probably save your fucking time.  NO FAP 90 is not easy to accomplish-- but it can be done.  I can say that the experience tended to get easier and easier over time.  The first 30 days or so were very difficult.  After that, there was probably 30 or 40 days where I didn't even think about sex.  I am heterosexual, but during this time, I was asexual.  While that may sound like a bad thing, it really made NO FAP 90 much easier to achieve than I had anticipated. And trust me, your desire for women will return to you-- and it will do so like a punch across yout face.  One day you will just be like ""damn I need to fuck.""

I'm not going to lie.  There were some nights where I was damn sleepless because I was so horny and my body was clamoring for pmo.  I was so committed, though, that I refused to break.  I loaned out both my computers, traded my Droid phone in for a basic phone without internet capability, threw away and loaned out all my porn, slept in my clothes, only touched my penis when cleaning it in the shower and urinating, refrained from watching tv shows and movies with sexy women as I might have been tempted to fap, when I did see something sexy I would be sure to look away; stayed extremely busy as I knew that time alone would equal fap temptation.  Of exceptional importance, I programmed my mind to think in certain patterns.  I would mentally push out thoughts of sex and think of something, ANYTHING, else.  

After about two months, I began experiencing pretty consistent morning wood.  I knew, then, that I was on the right path.

I finally fapped a little past 100 days, but was able to refrain from it for the most part over the course of the next month.  During the month following the 100 days that I didn't fap, I had sex with three different women and also got a handjob, blowjob, and striptease (which I masturbated to) from a 4th woman.  I can say that, for the most part, I had almost immediate erections with these women.  It was unbelieveable.  I literally did not have to think about my erection-- it was just there.  It felt as simple and natural as the blood flowing through my veins, the beat of my heart; my liver and kidneys doing their jobs.  My brain had successfully reset-- and it felt great.  Even when just kissing these women, I had immediate and unbelieveably hard erections.

I want to let those of you know who are about to start this journey that NOFAP 90 is legit.  It saved me.  It is a free and attainable cure for a serious ailment.  The number 90, in and of itself, is arbitrary-- it is a mean of sorts.  Some may be healed after 30; with others, it may take 200.  I think it depends on how long one has been viewing porn, how often one viewed porn during that period of time, and how hardcore/abnormal the type of porn viewed was.  Whatever the case, this is the cure.  Do it.  It is worth it.

Regarding all the other benefits of NO FAP, I do believe some of them truly exist, but I believe others come about do to the placebo effect, of sorts.  I did feel generally happier, more independent, and more confident.  I do believe some of that had to with a change in chemicals in my brain and body.  However, I think some of those experienced changes are due to me feeling that I was conquering my problem-- not from the conquering of the problem in and of itself.

I do need to add that I have recently fallen off the wagon, so to speak.  I have come to believe that once one engages in one's addiction, there is a flare up, of sorts, that one experiences.  Like someone eating a meal who hasn't eaten in a week, one will likely gorge oneself.  In effect, that is what I did recently with porn.  The sad reality, here, is that once addicted, I believe we are always addicted.  It is a battle that we will have to fight for the rest of our lives.  It is a batlle worth fighting though-- NO FAP will change your life for the better.  I know this-- I experienced it.  I felt a general euphoria, confidence, and capability that I hadn't felt in some time.  And, of course, I must mention again that my penis started working properly yet again.

Good luck guys.  Fight the good fight.  Stop jerking off.  Not only is it bad for you, it's a waste of your fucking time.  It's like sitting around and daydreaming all day long.  Stop daydreaming and go do the real thing.  Get a real chick.  If you're bad at that, join an online dating community and or read some books on how to get chicks (""The Game"" by Neil Strauss is pretty legit).

Think of it this way: when it's all said and done and you are at the very end of your life, do you want to look back and remember all the time spent daydreaming, your hand pumping on your cock while your pants and underwear are at your ankles and you have a computer in front of you with a chick getting fucked?  Or would you at least want to remember that you tried-- that you really, truly, fucking gave it your all to live life, to experience-- that you positively took advantage of the brief amount of time you were given on this planet?

Good luck guys.

They motivated me to continue my journey. 

Now it's my turn to share.

I sat down at orientation for a job. Across the room I spotted a cute girl and made eye contact with her (I never had the guts to do this before NoFap). I smiled and looked her dead in the eye (I could feel a beam of sexual energy being transmitted through the air) , she was beautiful. 

More beautiful than any pornstar I fapped to. 

I didn't want to just fuck her. 

I wanted to get to know her. 

I wanted an emotional bond. She smiled and looked down.

I RIPPED out a piece of paper from the packet they handed out, put my number on it, and calmly walked up to her. 

""You're cute. Text me""

THEN I WENT TO WORK FROM 7PM-5AM, PULLED AN ALL-NIGHTER SO THAT I COULD GO DO MY 11Am-7PM SHIFT, SET UP AND WENT ON A DATE WITH THE SAME GIRL IMMEDIATELY AFTER, AND MADE OUT WITH HER IN THE MIDDLE OF A MEADOW AT THE DEAD OF NIGHT.

I'm here to say that it's worth it to wake THE FUCK up.

Realize that life's more colorful outside of your screen. 

Realize that if you don't wake up now, it'll be harder down the road. 

Realize that your MAKING LOVE TO PICTURES instead of REAL WOMEN. 

Your brain is amazing. Cut out it's source of happiness and it will go bat-shit crazy. It'll force YOU TO CHANGE.  

Looking back a year at my younger self, I only have one word to describe what he was like. 

He was FUCKING PATHETIC. 

He smothered himself in self-induced ecstasy, similar to drug addicts. 

In a year from now, when I look back at my current self. I too will only have one word. I was a fighter.

However, when I was 13, I was depressed over changing schools and increased pressure to excel academically - though that may not seem like a very huge matter, it was to me. I rediscovered porn - particularly S&amp;M porn, which really got me off. At that time, I used PMO as an outlet for the depression I had. Any free time I had, if I was not at extra classes, I was in my room, *pretending* to study. I became addicted to a routine ; I would have a porn video playing, and would alternate between edging and orgasming. PMO didn't require me to think, it gave me pleasure which I drowned myself in. 

4 years - I would spent the next 4 years edging and orgasming every day, and on bad days, I would do it several times in a day. After every thing was done, and I would be wiping myself, sometimes I would cry. I would feel horrible, and it felt exactly like a crash after a high. I felt lonely, sad, and even more depressed with every fap. I would think back on my virgin self, and an overwhelming sense of self-pity would wash over me. I would think of my parents, and feel so ashamed that their daughter would be hiding herself in her own room, curtains drawn, while masturbating to no end. Only pseudo-sex, and false pleasure to fill my mind, I would go back to my routine to keep myself off depressing thoughts.

This year, I met someone. He's from work, and he's kind, and gentle, and wonderful. I would observe him pouring coffee so skillfully every day, and swoon every time he spoke. He is amazing. He makes me smile, and he makes me laugh, and he's a sarcastic asshole, and he makes me cry. For the first time in so many years, he made me feel. And I had forgotten that I could.

I confessed to him about my routine, and he accepted it. He hugged me, I cried, and at that moment, I told myself : I would change, no more excuses. But time and time again, I would relapse and relapse and relapse - and every time I did, I would be filled with this pang of guilt.

I confessed to him about my true feelings for him - and he rejected me. For a while, I didn't want to try anymore. I relapsed, and I consoled myself by telling myself that I do have a real reason to be depressed now.

We didn't talk after that. And when he saw me again, he would avoid me. Everything seemed hopeless and bleak.

This week, he left the shop. He resigned and got a better job doing what he truly loves. He stayed around long after his last shift to meet me. He said he was sorry, and that I must do things for myself, not for others. He told me he didn't want to be my motivation, and because of that, we will not be seeing each other again. He wanted me to be motivated by my own well-being and at that very moment, I cried - because I knew he truly cared for me, and that his decision to never contact me was final. He was smiling when he left. 

Later, I would open my bag to find a letter that simply said ""I know you are strong"" in his horrible handwriting. And I told myself, no more excuses. I would do this for my own sake. 

tl;dr. So here I am now. Day 2, and already struggling with urges. But I'm holding on. I will not give in. And I hope you guys will support me.

PS. Sorry for the long rant, needed to get this off my chest. r/offmychest didn't seem appropriate however.

**EDIT** : Thank you everyone for the enormous support - you have no idea how much it means to me. To clarify some things : it's not that I'm completely unaffected by him leaving, it's just that I choose not to completely collapse without him in my life - because I know that that's what he would want for me. 
At the end of it all, I am sad (because I am only human), and yet I am happy. Today is a new start, tomorrow is a new start, and every subsequent day will be a new start.

**Every day is a success story.**


I will be strong, and I only hope that all of you will be able to summon the strength that has always been within you too.

They were all women that I was genuinely interested in but I had one unusual problem.  I never wanted to have sex with them.  I was a virgin at the time and all of my friends were telling me I had to loose it, but I just didn't want to.  I even dumped one of my girlfriends because she wanted to have sex with me.  In my eyes that was a sign that she was more invested in the relationship than I was.

I didn't really have any of this in mind when I started nofap but it hindsight there is a definite link.  A few months into my first streak (right around 90 days actually) I started hooking up with a new girl.  From the very first time we kissed I could tell I was attracted enough to her to go all the way.  I had never really felt that way before.  It was incredible.  This new level of attraction is yet to fade.

It's my theory that porn programmed my brain to be attracted to 2D pornstars rather than real women.  Sexuality and romance were completely unrelated concepts in my mind.  I could never be romantic with a pornstar and I could never be sexual with a real woman.  It made sense at the time.

Now that I have been doing nofap for close to a year my outlook has changed quite a bit.  I don't have romantic or sexual feelings about pornstars and I have both romantic *and* sexual feelings for my girlfriend.

It's truly an amazing feeling and I'm grateful for it every day.  If you're ever questioning whether or not nofap is worth it, trust me, it's worth it.",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,month1,True,t3_1gor2k,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1gor2k/porn_will_rob_you_of_your_sexuality/,

I woke up this morning feeling pretty good, got some school work done, avoiding fapping, kissed my wife, all that great shit. I go to school to work with one of my professors on some major papers and when we're done with that, I work with him taking inventory of all the music instruments (I'm a music student). Once that's all taken care of, that's when everything hits the fan.

1. My wife informs me that she was pulled over for having unregistered plates. We know the plates were not registered and we literally could not get the money to do it because we are in a new state and some stuff happened that I don't want to go into detail, so we never got insurance or her new licence so she got ticked for unregistered plates, no insurance, and failure to change state license after 30 days. The ironic part is that her mom surprised us today with the money to get it all taken care of, but now a ticket must be paid as well.

2. I have to cancel a party I was planning for weeks because now we have to do all sorts of running around tomorrow in an unregistered car to get everything straightened out before the court date and hopefully maybe get the ticket lowered to only $260.

3. My tuition looks like it will have to go unpaid therefore forcing me to drop out of school after I have already completed half of my degree.

4. I have been looking for work and unfortunately I have not yet landed a job and so because of this my wife has to do pay all these bills while I have to sit back and watch her cry.

5. She didn't get a promotion she applied for, once again forcing me to watch her cry.

6. I just got done fapping and reset my counter. I am ashamed that I did as do any of us. I am so tired of everything going to crap now that I cannot contain myself. Fapping used to be my stress release and now that I've started this, it's become my drug with which the needle cannot escape my veins. I want to become a better man for my wife, for me, and for God and right now I could use some support right now since my wife is working an overnight shift tonight. If you downvote, that's fine. I spent most of this post rambling about my personal life which is mostly first world problems anyway, much less to do about fapping...

EDIT: Wow, I didn't actually think this would get any attention. Thanks for your words of support. I know what I'm doing now is just complaining about a problem that is easily fixed, I just needed to get if off my chest. You should know that my wife and I are just going to get a pair of bikes and bike everywhere for right now until we are able to afford a car again. As for my tuition, we still don't know what we are going to do. I made an appointment with my school's business office to see what we can do. Hopefully dropping out isn't that option.

The cause of the condition is nicotine, and we deprive ourselves of it just to feel relief when we smoke. Like putting on small painful shoes just to enjoy the relief of taking them off. Post-relapse, it is bitter disappointment and regret and shame. It is a complete farce, a fallacy, a subtle and deceptive trap. It mocks us, like a flytrap plant, luring us in until we are caught dead in it's trap. Every single orgasm was regret and lackluster and worthless. What a clever confidence trick. We know the future, like time-travelers. We know how it all ends, and how disgusted and repellent we will be afterwards, and yet we still do it. If we know our future, is it then not in our power to change it? The secret is in perception, and it is in psychological truth. And it has always been the secrets in our minds. These are the same principles laid out by Allen Carr in Easy Way to Stop Smoking. This man was the reason I was able to stop smoking, and many of those principles carry through to other areas, if only my deficient, finite mind could translate them.

One of the most beautiful states of mind that I've been in, is that beautiful post-clarity. When that disgusting and degrading animal lust departs from me, like a lingering ghost, and I am left in post-clarity, free from those shackles that bound me. And I crave life. I crave poetry and her smile and beautiful mornings and the sea. Yet that little demon monster, just like that nicotine monster, keeps on pestering. And the more we feed it, the more it takes and the more it needs. The secret... oh the secret. If only I knew, if only I could clearly translate it as Carr did. If we can disarm that monster, and starve it, and kill it, if we could unlock the shackles that bind our minds to this habit. If we could realize that is not impossible to overcome, that it can be done, and it can be done easily. If we could stop looking at it as an impossible feat, as a Goliath, seemingly giant and mighty and impassible, we could knock down this habit like a house of paper cards, and be free. But the secret lies not in willpower, but in the mind. In simple perspective. In soul searching and exploration of all the motives and nuances and thoughts and feelings deep down inside. Because if we deep down inside believe that we cannot overcome, then we will not. So we must challenge our deep-seated preconceived notions, which only our subconscious might know. But we can make those thoughts conscious, so that we may lay them in the dust. 

The secret is this.

1359026875.0,237,self.NoFap,176nwp,Can you do 24 hours? Good. Now repeat 90 times. How 90 days sneaked up on me.,cpecies,266,29,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/176nwp/can_you_do_24_hours_good_now_repeat_90_times_how/,"Wait a minute, if I can do one pushup doesn't mean I can do 90 in a row. That is true because with every pushup you get a little more tired. What if there was a method to do pushups so that each one leaves you exactly as tired as the one before. Then you could do 90 or 900 or 9000. I don't know such a method for pushups but I know a method for noFap.

The problem with noFap is the same as for pushups. With every day you become a little bit more horny than the day before. Depending on your willpower, you can keep that horniness in check for 7 days or 30, or 90. My previous record has been 120 days but I was miserable. 

Fast forward to the method. I've said it before and other people have said it before. It all starts in the mind. If you refuse to indulge in fantasy, there is no significant physical arousal. And in time, the fantasy becomes less and less frequent and you become better at shunning it away.

How to stop the fantasy. Just do it. It will be unintuitive because fantasy feels good and stopping it feels bad, but you have to decide to do it even if it seems like a losing game. Accept that apparent loss and noFap will be a walk in the park. 

Bonus: this applies to other areas of your life, for example: I want to stop spending so much time on the internet. Just do it. Expect and accept that you will feel bad for a while and that internet would make you feel good. Example 2: I worry about my future. Just stop. It will hurt to stop, somehow worry seems to give you the illusion that you're taking action. But you just stop and accept the pain of stopping the worry to reap the benefits of being worry free in the long run.

I haven't developed superpowers but I have discovered a few human powers which are really super.

*Here's my [meditation](http://www.ishafoundation.org/Ishakriya/Learn-online) program. I started with it around day 45 and I think it has made a lot of difference in my ability to master the mind.*

*My first 120 days have been miserable because of fantasy. It kept me in a constant state of physical discomfort without being able to release. This time around, without fantasy, there was no significant sexual tension and things went much smoother.*

It could be that some assholes bullied me in high school. It could be shame from my fap-related habits. But as it turns out I'm better at conversation than I imagined, as long as I keep positive on myself. The only reason my mind goes mush around pretty girls is because I feel unworthy, when in reality half the time they're just as nervous as me.

2.) **Reading is underrated.** One problem I encountered my last attempt was that I had no idea what to do with my alone time. I inevitably went on facebook, then reddit, then stumbled across some NSFW pictures, then relapsed. The internet is so flashy and satisfying I feel as though half of my porn addiction is internet addiction. I've started reading again after a long hiatus from it and I've found it's a great thing to pass the lonely hours. And, not to be cliche, but it really does expand the mind, make you smarter, and give you more to talk about. The more you read stories the better you become at telling them, and everyone values a good storyteller in their lives.

3.) **I didn't notice the positive benefits of NoFap until I stopped doing it.** I had never gotten a major streak going, the longest I took off was a week. But I had cut down to 3-4 a week on average, down from the 14+ I used to pull before I started. When I stopped NoFap, I went back up to 8 a week, and I started to feel sluggish and unmotivated. Then I'd take a day off, and I'd feel great again. Basically what I'm trying to get at is that NoFap works and you hardly even realize it. If you were a chronic masturbator and you're here now I can almost promise you feel better now than you did before you started, no matter what your mind tries to tell you. This goes along with the next one:

4.) **Fapping is definitely a problem.** It may not be *the* problem. It may not even be the biggest problem. But my life is not being lived to its highest potential because of PMO. So no matter what my brain tells me when I'm at my lowest low about how how fapping isn't a problem, and how I'm making mountains out of molehills, and how I should just fap and everything will be better, I know now that I can beat the urge.

5.) **You guys are fucking awesome.** Blatant pandering. But still, no matter how tough it gets, I know that there are people out there going through the same thing as me, always ready and willing to give advice or support or whatever a fellow fapstronaut needs. That's an invaluable tool.

My roommate was on the coach and had no idea what I just viewed. Needless to say this took a strong hold of me and caused me to get a semi. I kept walking around the kitchen continuing to do what I was doing to try to get rid of what I had just seen. But I couldn't. [I wanted to have sex so bad.

It was telling me I was in control and that sex no longer controls me. In one last attempt to make a drive for sex I found myself looking at a jar of mayonnaise I was using to make a sandwich. For one split second I looked at it with wanting eyes then heard ""**don't put your dick in the mayonnaise**"".

Time to grow up and be a man. For a long period of time, I was a boy. Even hitting the adult 18 , I considered myself a young boy instead of a man. I realize now it’s has all got to do with the way you see yourself in your life. I am now 26 and I know a lot has changed the last couple of weeks. I was thinking about this the other day and came up with my own little theory. Nothing groundbreaking or fancy, just playing with some ideas I have.

There are 4 stages a guy can go through in life. Some men stay in stage 2, while others go to stage 4. I’ll explain the stages later on. I’m still at stage 2, not even near stage 3. It’s because of NoFap I got there, there is a magic in this, a magic far better than the six second orgasm spasm we have after jerking off to porn. Transforming your life through willpower.

Here are the four stages:

* Stage 1: Boy/Young man
* Stage 2: Man
* Stage 3: Prince
* Stage 4: King

Let’s get further in to that. At stage 1 you are a boy, a foolish little child, trying to understand the world around him, As he grows up, he physically changes, but in his mind he’s still a boy, or rather a young man. The next step would be a man, however there are a lot of guys not ready for that stage yet. Not knowing what they want in life, who they want to spend their time with and just messing around. Not a problem of course, but it can become a burden to your progress as a man. You don’t have big responsibilities yet, so you can slack off a bit. 
Maybe a bit controversial, but I think that fapping to porn let’s you stay in the young man phase. By watching it, you create your own imaginary little world where you can get all the beautiful women on the planet. Just by clicking on your screen. I did that for about ten years. Ten years of my life wasted on virtual women. And whenever I got the chance to be with a real woman, my equipment would let me down. That’s when I saw this subreddit and immediately knew I had to try it. After a few weeks, I’m entering stage 2: Man.

I take my time seriously when I need to, looking for my own place to live, looking for a job and maybe later on a study I can do. I’m even getting driving lessons, I was afraid of driving for so long. Now I know why: I didn’t have a clear, concentrated mind. Now I do. My life is turning into the good road, but I’m not there yet. To be a man, it’s important that you take responsibility. You don’t hide behind a mask, so people will like you. You are the guy people will want to talk to. As a man, you’ll be saying to woman what you want to do with them. You will never again hear yourself saying: ‘I don’t know, where to you want to eat?’ Rather you say: ‘That’s where we are going and it will be amazing.’

Becoming a man is necessary, the world needs more powerful, caring, loving men. I say loving, because the real man portrayed by the media isn’t the real men we need. The media man, he is strong, masculine, loves sports and cars, and gets with many women. Sounds fun right? Except, that macho guy is overcompensating, always trying to be the better man, better in everything than you. You had sex? He f*cked a supermodel! You started working out? He lifted 300 lbs on his first try! Don’t be that guy. They’re overcompensating because they need validation. The real man gives validation rather than seeking it. There is this feeling I’m starting to experience. The feeling of having control over every situation. I still need some work, especially in the women area, but at least I’m not the awkward guy around females anymore. And I know when it’s time, I need to step up a get a level higher.

So you manned up, have you? You’re not quite there yet. Of course if you want, this can be your end stage, but why not going all in? The next stage is a prince. Why not king? Well, to become a king, you better be a prince first. A prince is someone who has his life together, a happy guy enjoying life. Not caring about others opinion. You envy those guys whenever you see them. Why? Because you struggle to talk to a girl, and he laughs at her and she is overwhelmed by his charm. Why can’t I be that guy? Because you are still in stage 1, my boy. Look and learn from princes. The prince is the best version of yourself. The prince is preparing for his kingdom, you just have to learn what your kingdom should be. Is it focusing on your career, your family? Or can it be that you’re able to do both? The prince is the guy you want to be. Fun, loving, caring and sociable. When you reached that point, and you will feel when it happens, you can be crowned, it is time, the world is getting a new king!
	
Then what is a king, if a prince already has what he wants? A king is someone who not only has everything he wishes, he also creates a better world for the people around him, even the people he doesn’t know. This is the gentleman, the king of the world. He respects everybody, even the people he won’t be getting anything of. The king is the best version of yourself, plus all the valuable lessons you learned from your own heroes. Whoever your hero is, incorporating their life lessons in your life will make you an even better man than you were. The king also creates the world around him, making his own wishes come true.
Now I’m still in stage 2. And I’m happy, but when the time comes to become a king, I will take the responsibility and create the best life possible for me and others around me. And remember, to become a king, become a prince first. 

And maybe most important of all,  don’t take life so seriously. A bit weird after this serious sounding post, but I had fun writing it. This is the stuff I’m thinking about nowadays. It’s better than the crap I used to fill my head with, I don’t need to tell you what that was.

Came very close to masturbating today.  I found myself reading a couple comics, which were about sex and depicted graphic, albeit cartoonish, images.  I logged off when I realized that this wasn't leading anywhere constructive, but my mind was already spinning with sexual scenarios and images.  

At this point, I felt like the only thing that would make me happy--the only thing that would allow me to move forward--would be for me to come.  I thought I needed to masturbate to be happy again.

But then I thought, ""That's what I always do.  Let's try something different.""  And so--I really didn't want to--but I picked up a thick novel that I'm in the middle of, and I started reading.  It was only a matter of seconds until the erection went away, and I was immersed in the world of my novel.

Reflecting back on it now, I feel slightly ashamed at how small my world was when I was horny.  My only concern was reaching orgasm.  That's it.  But instead, I chose to read, and my mind went on to explore larger things.  That was the real choice that I made--to use more of my brain, to be more aware of my world.  

I highly recommend starting on a novel.  Start one right now, one that you can really sink your teeth into.  It's amazing how fast your mind will switch gears from sex to story.  I'm reading Lonesome Dove at the moment, a Pulitzer prize-winning, action-packed story of the wild west.  Fantastic read.

Basically it dawned on me how freakin' awesome it is that my life is not a pop song.

Sex is incredibly salient in popular media today, and I think it's honestly ridiculous. Not just in pop music, you'd be hard pressed to find any genre that doesn't have a single ~~artist~~ entertainer (artists write their own songs, imo) who appears to be getting off on telling the audience how much he likes to get off. There's a never ending stockpile of female entertainers whose image is strictly, scientifically and insidiously designed to be sexually appealing and whose every song is either about a relationship or a breakup. And you can't blame these people when consumers eat that shit up. There are men and women who want to have more going for them than catchy stock tunes and one dimensional content but sadly, they have to work harder to be successful and more often than not they don't have as large a return because they don't have a monster sized industry supporting them.

And this is in no way limited to music. Sex and relationships are sold to us through television, movies, commercials, magazines, fashion, and just about any other form of popular media you can imagine. You name it, someone appears to have thought up a way to make it give you a boner. Frankly, it's ridiculous.

Not to mention literally so unreal. For the longest time, I was hung up on what feels like chronic loneliness. The only significant relationships I've had in my life are long distance relationships, and I've had fewer of those than I can count on one hand. There used to be a time where I literally thought [this](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/24403027.jpg), and I'd get severely depressed about it. But I wasn't really drawing that conclusion from the actions of those around me. I was drawing that conclusion from what I've been told dating and sex are from the media I'm surrounded by. There's so much smut out there that you start to think *something's wrong with me* if your life isn't smut and how fucked is that?! There is absolutely nothing wrong with me; nothing worth getting depressed over anyway. 

I think one of the best things about nofap is once you decide to step away from the idea of sexuality as a product, the subliminally sexual has less power over you. When I started this challenge, I was hoping I'd get superpowers and confidence and land a girlfriend. At this point though, it's not really about that anymore. *I've learned to embrace being single*, and each time I break my record I'm closer to having better self control and a life which is governed by fewer vices. I'm closer to being an unbridled, unabated me. And no pop song, movie, commercial or TV show is **ever** going to break that down.

My life may not be the stressful ebb and flow of constant relationships and breakups, but I honestly can't complain because I'm well rounded with a good head on my shoulders.

If you made it this far, I just want to say thanks for reading. I hope there was something in this you took away :)

In the epilogue of his book, he took an idea from Robert Glover's book ""No more mr. Nice Guy"" and expanded on it a bit

**Here's the excerpt**

&gt; ...And for those times, let me share with you a phrase that has helped me and countless other men through those dire straits.

&gt; The phrase comes from Dr. Robert Glover and his book No More Mr. Nice Guy, one of the best books I’ve ever read on men’s emotional health and development.

&gt; The phrase is: “What if it was a gift?”

&gt; Whatever happens to you, no matter how bad, no matter how bleak you feel. Ask yourself, “What if it was a gift?” And then **try to rationalize a way it could be so.**
Because see, in the world of emotions, there are no absolutes, you can usually draw whichever conclusions you desire. **So why not choose to draw conclusions of blessings, positivity and gifts?**

&gt; Ex-girlfriend dumped you and left you for another man. What if it was a gift? Because without her, **you would not have been put on this path of self-improvement** and you would have forever been stuck in a relationship full of deceit and no self-awareness...



Now, apply that thinking to our porn addictions or whatever sexual addiction you have. If you ever manage to overcome it, you will appreciate your sexuality much more than a person that has been sexually sober all his/hers life because **you have earned it through hard work and persistence**



Here's another excerpt, this time directly related to **PMO** from the [FeedTheRightWolf Website](http://www.feedtherightwolf.org/)

&gt; Looking back at it, **my addiction is the best thing that ever happened to me.**  No, I am not happy with all of the pain and sorrow that it brought into my life and the lives of my loved ones. I am not happy about all of the time that I've spent fueling my addiction. I am not happy with all the dreams that I gave up on, choosing to act out.

&gt; But I am happy that I am finally awake; **that I am finally able to see things around me for what they really are.**  I am glad that I have the rest of my life. I have the rest of my life, not my addiction, not the media, and not the porn industry.

&gt; And I believe that you will have a similar experience, even if you might not feel like it just yet.

So my fellow fapstronauts, We can either look at this as a curse and struggle it and be mad at ourselves, **OR** we can **choose** to accept it as a blessing. The mere fact that we have realised that we have a problem with PMO is the greatest gift that we could have given to ourselves. The decision to tackle it is even greater gift and **you can choose to appreciate yourself** for that

We snuck out behind the caddy shack, and sat in a tree. She brought out her bubbler and we got bubbly.


We've been friends since highschool; four years or so now. She dated my friends, but I was always too beta to try and pull anything. 


We'd get drunk, sleep in the same bed, tell secrets, nothing more. Always liked her plenty. Always thought about her, staring at the ceiling, excavating my vas deferens. 


I could tell her about anything. About the books I thought about writing, but never sat down to.  I told her about NoFap. About my fears. About getting stabbed. About my short comings, about feeling emasculated.


However, I never told her how I felt about her. I still haven't. Last night, though, I showed her.


The bowl was finished. She stood up and I stood up. And something happened that had never happened to me before: I communicated non-verbally.


I didn't even know I was doing it, but she returned my stare with a look I've never seen on her before. Her goofy smile dropped into shock. She looked as if I was about to attack her. I sort of was.


I stared at her for thirty seconds maybe. It seemed like thirty minutes. Not a thought in my head. 


Then I reached out and stroked her face so naturally it was like a stage direction. The flow of the stroke moved seamlessly to the back of her neck as if I wasn't the one doing it. I snagged a handful of her hair and pulled her in.


After maybe twenty minutes of bliss, we walked around the golf course, snuggled, kissed some more.  She said I'd changed somehow. I knew I had. We watched the sun come up and kissed goodbye to the tune of a waking world.


I've had my share of empty hook ups in college now. Forced, unsatisfying, centered around the orgasm. This kind of tenderness is completely alien to me, and yet it felt hardwired; a natural part of myself I'd just never explored.


Thank you NoFap. This has been a challenging fortnight, but it's so, so worth it.

I started my current run last July. I am making this post for a couple of reasons: 1) I hope that seeing someone make it almost a year without fapping will inspire some of our new fapstronauts (my story is somewhat inspiring, I hope) and 2) I have seen a lot of debate about whether or not wanting to get laid is a legitimate reason for starting NoFap.

I know many people start this thinking it will give you ""superpowers."" The thing is, it will if you are really addicted to masturbation. My NoFap journey started for a couple of reasons, but the main one is that I was ashamed of my unrelenting need to masturbate. I would do it at work, at friends houses, even at my grandmother's house. I was disgusted with myself and my need to ejaculate ruled my life. It didn't matter what I was doing, if I got the urge it wouldn't go away until I had fapped. So I set out to correct it. 

Yes, I had never had a girlfriend or sex before NoFap, yes I desperately wanted both of those things, and yes that was one of the reasons I started my Fapstronaut journey. However, it wasn't until I realized that I had a problem and I needed a real lifestyle change that my NoFap tendencies stuck. I relapsed four or five times over the course of June before I committed myself to working out and pushing thoughts of sex from my mind. Any time I got the urge to masturbate I would immediately get up and do some physical activity: basketball, lifting, running, biking, walk in the park, playing with my dog, whatever I needed to do to get my mind off of it. 

I also decided to tackle my procrastination, and this was one of the real keys to my success. Any time I was feeling too lazy to do something, whether it be yard work, working out, homework, writing a song (I make music as a hobby), or just getting up out of bed in the morning I immediately jumped up and did it. I didn't let my urge to be lazy override what I needed/wanted to do. This is important. This is the mind set you need to not relapse. You have to be of the mind that you won't *allow* yourself to do something you don't really want to do. Be the master of yourself, don't let *anything* control what you do other than your own will to do it. 

Using these methods I was fap free all summer (no small feat, considering my family had just moved and I had no friends in the area which meant constant boredom), and I returned to college in mid August. I met a woman (my neighbor) a couple of weeks after moving into my new apartment. Now, normally I would have been too shy to talk to her, too scared to make the first move. But this is where the supposed ""superpowers"" kick in if you hold off of fapping long enough (this includes edging, don't cheat yourself). I talked to her and got her number from my roommate who had gotten it (they were both smokers) and invited her over to watch our school's football game that weekend. She said yes! Long story short, we kissed that night and now I am no longer a virgin and I have my first girlfriend. We have been together ever since, and she is absolutely amazing. She loves the fact that I don't masturbate. She's told me so many times that she thought she was just going to have to accept that she wouldn't be the only woman getting her man off, but with me she knows she is and that means the world to her. I love her. We just moved into our first apartment together, and I'm going to propose to her as soon as I can afford the ring. 

Thank you NoFap, you have changed my life. I met the love of my life because you gave me the confidence to conquer my addiction. This can be you new fapstronauts; it might not happen as quickly, but trust me, if you put in the work you will get out of it the most amazing quiet confidence. This is because you know you are the master of yourself, that you have self control. That you can overcome your addictions and inadequacies. But you get out of it what you put in. I am a firm believer that you cannot edge if you want NoFap to work for you. Don't look at porn. Don't allow yourself to sit and think about sex.

I use to be able to last longer than four hours wearing a condom. After years of PMO I discovered that sex with condom made me feel absolutely nothing, even ED happened one time (it was a very big deal for me). I could feel sex without condom, but it wasn't the same as it was before (when I was 18). I didn't feel the intense pleasure as if I could blow up any second, I just felt a minor thing. I knew something was wrong, and I kind of knew it had something to do with daily PMO. I tried stopping but I wasn't sure if it would help, so I didn't. Not until I discovered Gary Wilson by accident.


**What turned me on before in comparison to now?** (*best be careful while reading, skip it if it makes you edge*)

Regular porn didn't do it anymore, I looked into all sorts of different women, different positions, different holes, it just didn't suffice anymore. Someone trolled me by sending a shemale porn video, and that did it. A woman that wasn't really a woman, the idea turned me on. This fetish stuck on me for many years (maybe five or six). It didn't go stale because I took pleasure in hunting for shemales that looked exactly like girls, with or without male genitalia. I knew it was hurting my sexuality, but I just continued. I pondered over whether or not I was gay, but I just didn't feel attracted to men as I did to women. **Women are the most beautiful thing on earth and I was missing it.**  After three months of nofap, if a girl so much as glance at my general direction it turns me on. Not only that, they feel like magnets to me. I'm extremely drawn to women and I want to interact and touch them. When I saw women before nofap, I would walk by thinking, ""I don't care about you, bye"". Today is the completely opposite, I'm drawn to most women in a primitive way. I absolutely love it. Porn doesn't exist for me anymore.

**What other changes have you noticed?**

I ain't going to say I'm anxiety free. But it did diminish like 80% from what it use to be. At this pace I will be anxiety free pretty soon. So, let me make a little list to make this easier on the eye.

* Much less anxiety

* Boner anytime

* Confidence

* Desire to meet people and to go out (I wasn't as SAP as some of you, but if you are extremely SAP and three months doesn't cut it, hang in there)

* 100% increase in sensibility

* Women detection radar (every girl within a thirty yard radius will be noticed immediately)

* 100% increase in focus (no more ADHD like symptoms, now I can finish things I start)


During this time I went in and out of a relationship, made new friends, went through new experiences and I lived much more than I would have done so before. 


**What happened when I fapped?**

When I fapped every day (several times per day), if someone called me to go out, I would immediately dismiss it. Even though I thought women were extremely attractive, I felt zero desire to try anything with them, because I was always 'satisfied' sexually. As a teenager I went through a period where I fapped about ten times a day (and this is no exaggeration, sometimes it would be more than that), as I grew older, it got to a steady three to four times a day, every day. I had panic attacks for a while, then anxiety attacks, then extreme ADHD symptoms (where I couldn't focus on anything, abandoned everything I started). I felt guilty after every PMO session. People said I shouldn't feel guilty, and that everything porn-related is normal, but I felt a strong sense of shame that I couldn't help.


**Bottom line**

How NoFap has changed me, and other reflections.",ChiunsKimono,271,47,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/15yk3e/90_day_challenge_completed_how_nofap_has_changed/,"90 days completed hard-mode mostly.  Had PIV sex two times during the challenge but without O.  This made nofap exponentially more uncomfortable.

Let me begin by saying that the chaser effect is quite real and very strong.  I'm not saying to not enjoy sex, but do not be surprised by how tempting PMO becomes after sex.

A bit about myself, I did not grow up with Internet porn as many here have.  It was Playboys and Cheri and other skin-mags when I was an adolescent, so I felt pretty rebooted after a couple weeks.  I stopped missing porn after about 60 days.  Now I see it as something to be avoided completely.

On to the benefits:

1.  Massively increased ability to concentrate for hours.  Wow.  This alone is worth the price of admission.
2.  An increased appreciation of the beauty of natural everyday women.  
3.  Renewed interest in my hobbies, coupled with more time and motivation leading to more skill, and better outcomes.  Drawing and songwriting are my main hobbies.
4.  Even less anxiety talking to attractive women.  Fuglies were never a  problem, but beautiful women always made me nervous.  They still do, but my desire for intimacy eclipses any nervousness or anxiety.
5.  More masculine and centered.  Even the tone of my voice seems deeper, and I feel an increased muscularity also.  I fit in with the guys better, and have easier conversations with other men.
6.  Less lethargy, less shame, zero guilt.  It feels like I've had an auric cleansing (cleaner aura).  This might be psychosomatic, but I feel like I give off a better 'vibe' than before.  

How I did it, tips and techniques:

1. Cold cold showers each day.  Yes, hydrotherapy really works.  The benefits are many - do a search.
2. Avoid porn/nsfw stuff completely.  For the best results.
3. Do not masturbate - just don't do it.
4. Don't bother telling your friends about it, they wont understand.
5. Cut out reddit, facebook, and other time wasters.  Enjoy only once or twice a day.  
6. Concentrate on your projects: health, business, art, music, social skills, etc.
7. Say 'yes' to every opportunity to socialize!

It is my opinion that the sex drive is good and natural.  It is a motivator for mankind to bring forth great achievements.  It must be channeled and utilized and not wasted with fantasy and masturbation.  Others might disagree, but sex is good.  Learn social skills, learn to be attractive, meet girls/guys whatever.  Get out there!

NoFAP is not a magic pill.  I see it as just one of the basic components of being a true and complete man.  I have no intention of going back to chronic PMO.  If I do relapse, I now know a way out.

Friends, stick with it.  It works.  But do not think of NoFap as something that will elevate you, but rather as a necessary first step in completing your mission.

Also, I am forever grateful for the 90-day challenge and for noFAP.  Thank you fellow fapstronauts.  -ChiunsKimono

Edit: I am 40.  Before NoFAP, I would PMO about 4-5 times a week.

Edit: I did not experience ED before noFAP.  Wow, thanks for all the support!

Edit: I take icy cold showers.  No hot water at all.  And I stay under until my breathing normalizes and my skin feels 'hot'.  This is when you acclimate to the cold-shock.

The amount of revelatory talk about the NoFap process has been ridiculous, and is really turning me off to this sub-reddit. 

Yes, I like NoFap. Yes, I have seen the benefits to my self-confidence, and I enjoy being free from my porn addiction. But does it completely change you as a person? No. No it fucking does not. YOU change yourself as a person. Yes, you get a temporary testosterone boost after 7 days, and that may motivate you to get off your ass once in a while. But that is the **only** scientifically proven benefit to what we are advocating here, besides the obvious effects on dopamine levels, which have not been linked to any behavioral effects. Yes, I know there haven't been many studies done. But the emptiness in the scientific realm is being filled with ridiculous, unsubstantiated claims. Students of history, does this sound familiar?

The rest of the claims made here, that it makes you see the world as a mountain to be climbed, that women will start hanging off of you like sloths, and your new-found super powers will grant you unquestionable charm, wit, and power. That is just. not. true.

However, /r/NoFap is proof of power. The power of a placebo, and what happens when promised effects get circle-jerked to the moon. So many submissions on here are just layering on top of each other, relating more and more astounding effects. Then newbies come and read these effects, are **amazed** by the promise, and then believe they are having the same results because they read about exactly what should happen to them.

But it isn't based on science. It's based on personal anecdotes that are deliberately fluffed up in order to draw **upvotes from brainwashed newbie NoFappers** who jizz at the thought of being a more assertive person. And the process is really spiraling out of control.

Anyone remember the game KOTOR? When everyone in the underworld of Taris was longing for the ""promised land"". That's what you guys remind me of. And it's really, really sad.

The truth hurts guys, get a fucking grip.

**I am not trying to troll, I'm trying to shock this sub-reddit back to reality.** Back to how I remember it before the crazies took over. And no, not all of the posts on here are like the ones I'm blasting, but they are becoming more and more common, and it needs to stop.

http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vcfrn/how_do_i_share_this_wonderful_thing_that_is_nofap/

EDIT 2: I'm pleased with the response so far. One of the main answers to my criticism is:
&gt; So what? Who cares if its a little overboard? Who cares if its a placebo? Its making people feel better, and helping them solve their problems. The metaphysical mumbo-jumbo is making people accomplish things that they never would otherwise. Isn't that all that matters?

No, it isn't all that matters. Reality matters, truth matters, and when you forsake those ideas on an irrational path towards some promised, superior state of being, you are going to end up disappointed. It is important to keep in mind that porn addiction is a relatively modern phenomenon. In fact, it has only been around in any significant form since the invention of recorded video, and has only been widespread since the invention of the Internet.

Before porn addiction, there were still awkward, insecure, reclusive, and cowardly people. Yet the priests of NoFap are promising cures to all these ails. All quitting porn is doing is returning you to **normal**. And normal doesn't mean ""confident and commanding"" for everybody. True confidence comes from accomplishments, and although you may trick yourself into feeling astoundingly more confident by just quitting porn, that's all it is. A trick; a placebo. I granted in my first post that I did feel some boost in my confidence. That is true. It seems to be a very common effect for many NoFappers. But lets not jump to conclusions here and say that correlation is equivalent to causation. Perhaps less time masturbating = more free time = more activities = more accomplishments = more confidence? Therefore quitting porn doesn't intrinsically lead to buckets of confidence, but rather extrinsically; you cannot forsake the other steps involved after quitting the porn itself.

**So what do I recommend we do?**

Downvote. And more importantly, **call out the bullshit when you see it**. The little prissy downvote blurb added by the mods says to only downvote posts that are abusive and/or off-topic. Well, dishonest claims contributing to a charade of magnificence are incredibly abusive, because those who fail to gain the promised effects are going to be discouraged, think the **entire** thing is a sham, *which it isn't*, and go right back to porn.",,False,,t5_2skrn,1340296908.0,,year1,True,t3_vdc45,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vdc45/rnofap_we_need_to_talk_this_is_not_a_religion/,

I just wrote this out in a comment on another post, but I'm going to post it because I think this would really help a lot of people. I think there need to be more threads directed to helping out the beginners, because success stories are inspiring but don't actually help, and reset stories help nobody.
*If you've gone more than 2 weeks, help out some bros, the first 2 weeks is the hardest and I find the auto-pilot of nofap picks up after that. Share what worked for you and answer questions if you see them*

**GIANT WALL OF TIPS BEGINS NOW**

The best way I've found to keep a good streak is to start a good streak. Anything less than a week is horrible because its very easy to say ""a week is so little time, I'll catch up to now no problem"" and then you fap every couple days and never get past that. I know this doesn't actually help, but if you get to a week you won't want to reset as much. If you get to 2 weeks, even less because it takes a long time to make back 2 weeks of work, THAT'S A MONTH BY THE TIME YOU'VE GOTTEN BACK TO WHERE YOU WERE BEFORE.


My best tips right here right now just for you.

1) Write down the reasons you are doing nofap and keep them close, keep theme somewhere you can find them. When you want to fap you litterally forget these reasons, like legitimately cannot remember what they are. You need to have them written down on-hand so that you can remind yourself of why you are doing this, otherwise it will seem pointless and you will give up. Only after fapping do you remember all the reasons you didn't want to and you get frusturated.


2) You get the intense craving to the point where you've already decided to fap, I know you know this point, the point where you've already written off nofap as dumb and are opening up porn tabs. When you reach this point make a conscious decision to yourself ""wait until tomorrow, if nofap is actually not worth it, it still won't be worth it tomorrow and I can fap as much as I like."" The thing is, tomorrow you're always really really thankful you waited. It never works out that the next day you were happy about it, this technique has probably saved me 6 times during this current record I have going.


3) Get a streak going! Seriously, at a week you won't want to lose it because a week is a damn long time and you won't want to do it again. Once you're done a week and still going you're on your way to 2 and once you hit 2 weeks, from experience lurking people on here and myself, you're in the gold man. That 2 week badge is just inspiring and it takes a long time to get there and the commitment to go 5 days compared to the commitment to go 2 weeks is massive. I'd say going 2 weeks does almost as much as going a month for example, while going 5 days does about as much as going 2 days.

4)**My edit tip because I forgot** Don't seek out porn type vices. Notice I didn't say porn, I said porn-type vices. This included browsing all the bikini pictures of that girl from highschool on facebook, going to massage parlours, basically ANYTHING THAT IS INTENTIONAL VISUAL AROUSAL THE WAY PORN WAS. If you happen to be watching a show and there's nudes you don't have to turn it off, just don't rewatch that part 1,000,000 times. Accidentally seeing some nsfw content isn't as bad as intentionally going out and searching for things that despite not being porn, are still fuelling your addiction.

These are my best tips. Write down your reasons for nofap because you will forget them and think nofap is pointless, if nofap is pointless, fapping is guaranteed. Wait until the next day, not only does this get you another day which is awesome, but you'll never actually give in if you do this. The temptation to fap is entirely chemical and if you sleep it off the next day you'll be back to your current mindset, inspired by nofap and wanting to be done with that. Use these 2 tips to go a week, you'll feel good after a week and it'll feel like a nice accomplishment. THIS DOESN'T MEAN TO GIVE UP. At this point, you have to do it again, you have to use the 2 tips to go another full week. The first 2 weeks is hardest, once you get past that it gets much easier because the streak starts making itself grow, its a self-fulfilling prophecy. The less time you've gone into nofap the easier it is to reset. Good luck man, big rant, I really think if you follow these 3 tips it'll help though, it did for me.

P.S. last note, a lot of people say to go find a hobby or get out of the house, I found that I couldn't get into anything at the beginning at all because I felt the same as I always did about these other activities. I think doing nofap makes you go and do other activities, not the other way around, focus on reaching 2 weeks and I think you'll see the massive difference. 90 days sounds impossible because you're only seeing it from the week 1 perspective of horniness, at the 2 week perspective of horniness 90 days seems much more attainable. Trust me from experience.

TL;DR: Laziness won't get you fapless, take the time and read this you nincompoop.

You would think that at my age my Fapping days would be over, but you would be wrong. The big difference back when I was a teenager or young man is that back then you had to go down to the local convenience store and buy a Penthouse or Hustler magazine, Fap relentlessly for a day or two, and then stash the magazine under the bed for later, eventually growing tired and bored with it and tossing it in the trash and moving on with my life. Now, as you all know, there are unlimited options for free porn day or night. After a painful divorce, I found myself isolated and depressed and had turned to PMO for solace. I have been wondering why I lack any enthusiasm for life and the things I used to enjoy. It never occurred to me that the PMOing could be the problem. I just figured that it was the divorce and the pressures of life that were getting me down.

I had heard about this NoFap reddit a week ago in a news magazine called ""The Week"" that had a brief article about the NoFap movement, and how it was changing people for the better. I had also read about abstaining from PMO on body building &amp; PUA sites but just didn't think that was something I could, or would do. Yeah, there are a few skeptics. But for every person that says it's bullshit or a placebo, there are hundreds that tell of the positive changes in their life. At the very worse, I won't be wasting time on internet porn and actually get out and do stuff. 

So there it is, I'm putting it out there for all to see. I would normally lurk and try to deal with this on my own, but this community seems so supportive, and I feel that it is important enough that I should be held to task. It starts today .... Day 1.

I'd like to begin by saying that I don't subscribe to the fact that nofap alone gives you superpowers, but I do believe that it's an important step to take if you're on a road to self improvement. Now I was never really one of the 5-10 times a day addicts, so take this with a pinch of salt and know that you have my full respect and support if you're going cold turkey after going at yourself for several hours a day.

The self control that you exert by doing this makes you *sexy as fuck.* This confidence isn't grown out of you just not masturbating, it's from the very fact that you're taking over from your primal instincts. Girls notice it (hell... some guys notice it) and above all else you notice it. You get to look in the mirror and go *""fuck yes, you're a man.""* There ain't much better than that.

Now personally, I didn't stop with nofap. As soon as I was in control I started doing press ups every night. This evolved to include more reps, planks, leg raises and you name it (I can't afford gym equipment or membership). I'm not exactly Tom Hardy, but I've gone a long way from the scrawny boy I was before. I've also started playing guitar again, learned to cook and as a result started eating a helluva lot better. I don't even spend that much time on the internet any more.

Oh, and I got myself a beautiful girlfriend at last :)

The point is, nofap represents you taking an active role in your life: moving you up and beyond some passive consumer of cheap tits on a computer screen. To make things a little hyperbolic, you're releasing yourself from slavery to your own unconscious mind. If you want to make something of yourself, it all starts here - but it's only the first step.

Thought I should give back some tips that helped me in one of the most life changing experiences that I've had. 

I've already written long posts on the steps of my experience in doing this in great detail but I'm not sure if I had ever written anything such as this. 

This is something that I hope another me doesn't have to go through without knowing again.

--------------------------------------------------------------------


First of all when you enter into a nofap lifestyle you should know why you want to do this. Make sure you have a clear goal in order to remember the reasons of your actions.

- Now a lot of people now a days seem to be doing this for the sheer of getting laid/losing virginity which is a nice end goal, but from my experience it will cause frustration and anger and you're going to feel extremely lonely at the end. I would say self control would be a better goal for long term. 

- Don't tell everyone of what you're doing, I did this mistake and now I'm stuck with the ridicule every day. Yes people find this odd and will give you high fives for jerking off, porn and masturbation have become a norm apparently because it includes you in the bigger group. Once you start to challenge that view they will make fun you, these people could be your friends, siblings and etc.... So just keep your goals to yourself.

- Always stay busy, gradually make sure that you're staying busy with productive things. Unemployed? Write resumes and apply for jobs. Looking for a relationship? Go talk to strangers, doesn't matter if it's a girl or a guy... just engage in random conversations. Eventually your procrastination will reduce and you'd thank yourself.

- Now if you're going through exam week or if you have a very difficult course load I wouldn't recommend going through nofap till you finish putting those off, my reasoning is that nofap will pre-occupy every minute of your life. Instead of thinking about your school/university work you'd be just surfing r/nofap and thinking about girls. If you're 100+ days in then perfect you shouldn't abandon ship, but your grades will be affected if you're in this at the start. This could be different from one person to the next but from my experience it hindered some of my analytical way of thinking. So get into nofap when you're ready and you know for sure you're going to this for yourself to better yourself. 

- Now one thing that almost everyone forgets about here is working out, please sign up for a gym membership or just workout at home. Go 5 times a week, go to /r/fitness and look at the FAQ on there. Just stick to it and you'd thank yourself.

- Always hang out with friends specially on the days you're most idle, it will help you stop thinking about nofap and porn. 

- Now for a lot of people doing nofap is easy for the first couple of months because it's not the fap itself that causes them to crave orgasm but it's porn itself. Delete your stash when you're ready to do so, also if it would help install k9 blocker and block the porn sites, but from what I've seen it will just make you crave porn right away. It's similar to telling yourself you'd never eat sweets again on a Thursday and then next week you'd go back and eat it cause you have a constant reminder of what you're missing.

- For reddit there is Reddit enhancement tool which can also block nsfw links. 

- Develop a strong willpower by doing other things such as cleaning up your diet, reading books, clean your room, do laundry and other things you'd enjoy doing.

- Sign up for chains.cc and every night instead of wanking put a little dot in there and fall sleep. 

- Stick to this for more than a week and the hardest part is almost over then you'd flatline and then you'd get your sex drive back up again use that energy into something that you'd enjoy that doesn't involve porn or wanking.

- Don't fool yourself, everytime you watch porn or edge it's almost like 5 days of going back. So don't hinder your recovery.

- Remember you're healing your brain and making yourself a better person, the future you will thank you.

- Re-frame your urges, figure out why you're getting horny, if it helps keep a log every day so you'd see the changes in your behaviour over time.

- If you hate something about yourself then change it.

- This is not the magic pill to solve everything in your life, it will not turn you into a superhuman. What it will do is bring up a lot of emotions you had been bottling up and hiding behind nofap and it will make you realize of your mistakes, it will show you the reality of everything. In some ways it's like matrix, you'd look around everyone and you'd be like ""hmm... they're all sleep and I'm awaken.""

- Whenever you come across a nsfw material, acknowledge it and then just move on. It's similar to someone who's dieting from overeating food, just acknowledge and realize the implication if you partake in the action and then move on. 

- Get a squeeze ball and release your stress on that whenever you get an urge, it seemed to have helped me in the first couple of months.

- So don't sit alone by yourself in your room trying to find an end result that ends in a fap a night till you fall sleep. Just stay active and get out there, the more pre-occupied you are the easier it will be for you to forget about fapping and porn. Stay around people and you'd learn a lot of things.

If you guys have tips of your own add it into the comments and lets help each other.

Best of luck in your journey,

1375254995.0,215,self.NoFap,1jeoxu,Apparently some people take this way too serious.,GaryTheSnaill,302,87,242,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1jeoxu/apparently_some_people_take_this_way_too_serious/,"Hello NoFap community,

Yesterday found a nice and funny picture and shared it on here. Many found it funny, but also many did not like it because it said 'My favourite way to masturbate? Inside a woman'. I did not mean this post in any serious matter all though some people took it too serious and were 'disappointed' because I'm posting this as an Elder.

I just wanted to point out that we as a NoFap community should be able to laugh at things at times even if it's jokes about masturbation. Lately I've been seeing a lot of serious posts only about relapses etc. I just wanted to make the mood a little less serious because I've adopted a sentence to my life which I intent to keep the rest of it.

'Life is a joke and we're part of it, so smile'. 


Having fun in life is very important, don't consider NoFap too serious even though it can, of course, be a very serious subject. Don't get lost in all the frowning and unhappiness because you relapsed again or did something else that is stupid. 

LAUGH IT OFF, because in the end, you'll make it and you KNOW it.

Just my two cents.

Sorry for my crappy writing, but I need to get this out. I'll start from the beginning.

I've been on a PMO cycle everyday of my life since I was literally 10 years old. I am now 20 years old and I do it about twice a day. So roughly I've done this to myself 7,300 times. That's 7,300 women that I've been with in my head. Until now, that has been just fine.

Recently some of my usual problems have worsened. I've always blown off studying and homework to watch porn and masturbate. I thought that was normal. I've always spent all my class time eagerly thinking about rushing home and booting up my computer. I thought that was normal. I've always had to start looking at more and more extreme sites to get my fix. I thought that was normal. I realize now that I have never procrastinated or blown off work in my life as much as I do now. I also now realize that I have never spent so much time watching porn as I do now. I now realize that what I watch to get me off is sick and shameful. 

I hit a wall when I realized that the only time I really initiated sex with my girlfriend was when we were watching porn together. I never try it otherwise. I'm never really into it, otherwise. When I noticed this I started getting scared. 

For some reason, today of all days I stumbled upon nofap. After one glance at this subreddit, I finally know my demon. It's one that I've always had an inkling about, but have always been too embarrassed to face. Because until today, this was not a real world problem. It was something that right wing nutjobs brought up as propaganda. It was something that I joked about with my buddies ""Yeah bro I'm a total porn addict lolololol."" To me, this was not a real condition that people have. I finally saw the truth after the hours and hours of research I've done today. I finally believe it after reading all the studies and research. Even my suspected ADD and focus issues are explained by this problem. 

I have realized that I am the epitome of an addict, and I am ready to quit. Today is my start day and I'm hopeful for the future. I'm tired of living my life in a fantasy. I'm tired of feeling guilty about the way I handle my relationships. I do think porn has it's proper place, but until I learn to control myself, I must abstain. 

Thank you for listening.

The two sides of your brain are in an unending quarrel. One side of your brain is telling you, ""You NEED to fap!! Just a little! You can start NoFap tomorrow!!"" While the real, human side of your brain is telling you ""You're gonna regret this. You can't do it.""

Here are some other things your brain might be saying right now:

You need it
You need it badly.
You need it now.
It feels so good.
It's not hurting me.
It's not hurting anyone.
It's harmless.
I only need to do it once.
It's just a little bit.
One more time and that's it.
It's only for a sec.
You can't stop.
Keep going.
You don't want to stop.
You'll stop tomorrow.
This will male me feel much better.
It will feel good.
Only one more time and I'm done forever.

Well guess what? That's your scumbag brain talking. 

You need it badly? Yes, it may seem like you need it badly.

You're dead wrong.

Your instinct driven BRAIN wants it badly. Your brain's chemicals are all outta whack, so in order to balance out the chemicals the only way your scumbag brain knows how to, your brain wants you to fap. 

STOP AND LISTEN TO YOUR BRAIN. DO IT. 
SERIOUSLY LISTEN TO YOURSELF.

(""you need this. you need this. you need this."")

YOUR BRAIN WANTS IT SO BADLY. 
But deep inside you KNOW you don't want it.

Just stop and think for a second. Just think about what is at stake here. Your dream. Your wonderful dream of a beautiful, fun girl who loves you for who you are. Bright and beautiful eyes, and gorgeous smile. Someone to poke at and tickle. Someone to laugh with, and share beautiful and fun moments with. Someone to keep warm in the cold nights, with her snuggled up against you, protecting her from the dangers of the world. A fragile and beautiful woman.

Not a picture of a girl on a screen who you just use then throw away. Women are not objects, and deep inside you know this. Be strong. Stand up to your urges.

Which is why you should STAND UP NOW AND SAY:

SHUT THE FUCK UP SCUMBAG BRAIN!! NOBODY LIKES YOU!!
YOU CAN'T HAVE WHAT YOU WANT!!
YOU ARE NOT THE ONE IN CONTROL OF MY LIFE!!! 
I AM.


NOW GET THE FUCK OUT OF YOUR FANTASY, AND TAKE A WALK.

fucking thank you.

Edit:
Guys and girls. I think there is a serious misconception going on here. I understand the need to say that porn caused you to relapse. Can someone tell me why it is necessary to specifically mention a pornstar's name or a specific porn website? It seems like a way of overglorifying what caused your relapse. Am I wrong?

1375885514.0,212,self.NoFap,1jvuoi,90 days doubled = 180 days of living a new life,craphty,242,30,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1jvuoi/90_days_doubled_180_days_of_living_a_new_life/,"Hello fellow journeymen,
I wanted to give an update on my ""new normal"" as well as a few words of encouragement for those on this self-improvement journey.


Today is my 180th day of avoiding PMO. I am 33 years old and when I look back at my past porn habit I am ashamed of how much time I have wasted. PMO was a habit for me, one where I would spend 2 to 4 hours a night searching for ""just the right video"" that was bizarre or degrading enough for my mind to feel satisfied. Like any habit the amount and intensity of the required material escalated to unhealthy levels. I was a slave to my mind. I rationalized away my self-destructive behavior, excusing myself again and again, all while feeling weak to my own urges. I viewed women as sexual beings only, and secretly hated myself and felt unworthy of love. If this is also your story fellow Fapstronaught... take heed: there is hope.


After finding out about NoFap (from 4chan of all places) I read up and watched the Your Brain On Porn videos. I then understood that part of my problem was willpower... the other part was addiction. When I understood my behavior as an addiction like any other (to cigarettes, drugs, etc) I resolved to take control of my life and wrestle my mind free from its addicted state.


It was not easy at first. I had physical pains and withdrawal symptoms in the fist week. There was a literal burning sensation in my groin that wanted release. I stuck with it. I relapsed a few times but now, after relapsing I understood that it was like a smoker wanting for ""one more cigarette"" - and I forgave myself. I saw my body as acting separate from my true desire and made peace with myself that although the flesh is week, my spirit was willing. I did not give up, and neither should you.


I started on ""hard mode"" (no gf) but after a few weeks I met this new and amazing girl who will become my wife in a few months (we are engaged!). It was difficult to transition into a relationship as years of self abuse using porn had desensitized me sexually with DE as well as mentally. There was a period of resetting to my ""new normal"" which is what I now live everyday. Here are some things I now enjoy that I did not before:


* Improved mental clarity - there is a mental fog that used to follow me around blurring and dulling my sight and other senses. I feel more alert and sensitive to the world now.

* More productive time - I used to have a routine of coming home from work, eating food then spending the rest of the night torrenting porn or searching for the ""right video"" to get me off. Now, I have my fiancee with me in the evenings to talk to, to cook together, to play with the dog, to enjoy our time instead of waste it.

* Self esteem - I used to avoid social situations and even going out with friends as my anxiety worsened. This social anxiety was rooted in feelings of unworthiness. I did not feel I had anything useful to contribute to conversations and my presence was a burden to others. Not anymore. I speak from my heart and am bold in my actions - I have re-discovered the man I was years ago.

* More in control of emotions and life - Before I would feel like I had little control of my daily life and that my insular routine was keeping me ""safe"" - in fact my sheltered existence was wasting my life away in a daily grind that only served to fulfill my base animal desires (eat, sex, sleep). I have broken that cycle and you can too. Through meditation I now have more control over how I think and feel and use that control to choose positive things to dwell on. You are your own worst critic... learn to forgive yourself. Learn to love yourself... weaknesses and all.

I hope others in this sub reddit stay on course and benefit themselves the way I did. I used NoFap as a starting point to bettering myself and my life. I have leaned that no one is a lost cause and we are all able to be better people. NoFap gives you a sense of self-pride which will carry over into other aspects of your daily life. Other people will notice a difference in your posture, attitude, mood and energy level.


My ""success story"" is just one of many. This 90 day challenge is a beneficial teaching tool - it teaches you about yourself. Learn your body. Learn your mind. When you do, you will figure out how to ""hack your brain"" and divert your negative energy into something more useful. Do it for yourself. Do it for others that are important in your life. You are worth it.

1370118058.0,217,self.NoFap,1fhbdr,Story from a lady's perspective.,,251,34,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fhbdr/story_from_a_ladys_perspective/,"So I started masturbating when I was about 5 years old.  My sister is 8 years older than I am, and I saw her crossing her legs while watching MTV one night.  Not knowing what she was doing and being the curious youngster that I was, I decided to try it out in my room and enjoyed the ""tingly"" sensation it gave me between my legs.  I would cross my legs everywhere after this!  At home in my room, in the bathroom, at school, etc.  I'd sit on the monkey bars and give myself that feeling.  Eventually, maybe around 7 years old, I started to have an orgasm.  It was the most amazing thing ever!  I'd masturbate every time I took a bath (water faucet is a favorite) or got into a hot tub (our family had one).  One day my mom pulled me aside to tell me that ""it's okay to touch yourself, but you should only do it in private, and it's a problem if it becomes an obsession.""  I was too little to understand what obsession was, so I essentially ignored her.

I masturbated every single day for my entire adolescence and up through high school and college.  Sometimes I'd masturbate a few times in a row and in strange places (e.g. under the bed at my grandma's house).  When I started working I'd masturbate in the bathroom at work at least once a day to break up the monotony of the afternoon.

It took me a while to get involved with porn, but once I did, I'd spend entire days watching porn and masturbating instead of working (I worked from home for a while).  Beyond the excessive masturbation, I'd also be really unsafe and reckless in real life, hooking up with random people just for the hell of it.  I couldn't think about anything but sex most of the time.

During times when I would have a regular sex partner, I'd be satisfied by them, and then when they would go into the bathroom to clean up I'd masturbate.  Or after we were done taking a cute couple's shower I'd stay in afterward and masturbate.  Often times I'd masturbate in bed next to them while they were sleeping; I got off on the idea that they didn't know I was right next to them pleasing myself.  Even when I was in the act of having sex with them, my mind would often be thinking about fantasies I'd collected from porn or other means, rather than being in the moment in reality with my partner.

This year I've become really disgusted with my habits.  I feel like my energy has been completely sapped and my mind and focus are fragmented.  Concentration on anything substantial has been difficult, especially with porn available at a moment's notice on the internet.  The procrasturbation has been out of control.

Luckily, something changed back in March (came out of a serious depressive episode) and I've started to get some distance from my habits, though I've still had days where all I do is watch porn and masturbate.  I even turned down the chance to have a threesome with a couple I've lusted after for a few years!  I'd heard of this subreddit but didn't really take it seriously; I guess I wasn't ready to stop or didn't feel I was in a place where I could do so successfully.

Well, that time has come!  Last week, I schlicked for the last time.  I'm just now getting to my first challenges, noticing triggers that come up or differences in my urges/behavior.  Reading your stories and posts is very encouraging and motivating, and I'm a sucker for science so the TED talk and other resources have also really helped me.  I'm looking forward to leading a healthier life!",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,,True,t3_1fhbdr,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fhbdr/story_from_a_ladys_perspective/,

Below I will be counting together the benefits I've had by doing the nofap challenge.

My benefits are:

**Energy** - You can't even imagine how much energy I've gained since I've started the nofap challenge - the effect is mindblowing. When I'm not working out in the gym, I'm having trouble sitting still in class, because of the huge amount of energy I've obtained by not fapping.

**Wet dreams** - I haven't had any. At first I was pretty disappointed by it, but I eventually broke through the mindset by saying to myself: ""You really don't need an orgasm, who the fuck cares?""

**Discipline** - My self-discipline has skyrocketed. If I want something done I get it DONE. No slacking, no ""I'll get it done tomorrow"" thoughts.

**Social skills** - I'd like to thank Seddit for helping me to become a better social person. I've read alot from Seddit's website and learned alot. I'm currently engaged in 4 female and numerous male friendships, which I've never thought possible before. Thanks alot Seddit!

**Fitness** - My goal in fitness is to finish a half marathon in one day in rowing. I've found rowing to be extremely fun and challenging! The only thing I'd say to those people considering fitness: Find something that YOU enjoy! Not something someone said you should do because of the huge muscles you would get. You need to find that one thing that YOU enjoy, and keep doing until you are happy with your goals.

**The Beauty in women** - The first things I noticed when I began my nofap challenge, was that my bad habit of seeing only the beauty in women automatically shifted to be very accepting and openminded towards almost any woman I've met. 

**Sexual desires** - Right now I want to go out there and FIND a mate for me. MY sexual desire has never been higher, and I've started to become more observant towards women who could become good girlfriends and eventually good mothers. It's not entirely about their beauty anymore.

Looking back on the past 90 days, I've come to realise that anyone can do this if they put their mind to it. I feel like a better person with so much more to give, compared to my old self. Sure, things have been hard on the road to where I am today, but that is nothing compared to reward at the finish line. And I'm not talking about fapping.

For all you fapstronauts out there: Keep it up! I know you can do it! No giving in! No surrender! **NoFap!**

PS. Here is my [""Don't give up""](http://imgur.com/a/R0w8p) wallpaper collection, to those of you who needs a little extra for the road ahead of you.

1357023116.0,212,self.NoFap,15rhie,So you're new? Welcome to NoFap. We pass out free Zen here.,DEVi4TION,255,43,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/15rhie/so_youre_new_welcome_to_nofap_we_pass_out_free/,"Check to the right, on the sidebar, you will need to get a badge. I've been around the block, let me explain a typical nofap experience.

After a couple weeks you will wake up and start singing as you put on your shoes. Head out the door to the corner store for a gatorade and hope to find someone on the way for a little pointless chit chat. Then you will slap your forehead as you realize what just happened because your alarm for 9am is going off. You disable your emergency 10 and 11am alarms and smile as you look at how bright the trees look, how pretty that neighbor girl looks today, maybe even look her in the eyes as you two trade little smirks. Nofap will seem like the golden key.

That doesn't last forever, it might even get lethargic and depressing for several weeks. The flatline will strike. Don't fear, it will always end, just ride it out. If you fap you will only have to face another flatline. Your energy will return quite a bit :-)

Then... you will inevitably fap out of curiosity, feel like an idiot, then repeat the cycle until you've learned all the little lessons on self control, self acceptance, and the inner workings of your cogs and chemicals. Nofap's all engulfing significance will begin to shrink to a more realistic level, it will fit in with your other healthy routines or might even begin the chain of healthy routines you've been trying to start for the last few years. Something so close to you, so primal, and so powerful begins to break under your reigns. You will gain perspective on a drug addict. You will learn monk's disciplines. You will know one of the the most personal struggles you could have. You will feel raw weakness. And for this experience you will always have that one little extra advantage in the face of your future challenges.

You will get horny. Really. Really. Horny. You have to learn to control it, its excess energy that you have to direct or it will direct you, if you're going to make it you will have to get comfortable with being horny and you will learn to enjoy it.

To succeed at nofap you will need to make it a lifestyle, start winning at everything if you're going to win nofap. Its called a challenge for a reason. The spillover effect is nice, too.

Lets talk about ""super powers"". Some people here claim to gain them, other people dismiss them. I'm going to tell you they are very much real. Its a part of the rebound, when someone has been so in the dumps for a while the vibrant state can seem foreign, mundane things that were a challenge become a breeze and that can really blow someone's mind. they think simply not touching their dick has granted them something they didn't have before. well, it did. 

The chemicals at play, you know them covered in YBOP, but I'm going to mention one that gets overlooked. Acetylcholine. Acetylcholine is reduced from excessive masturbation, which will cause a brain fog/depression/lethargy. You all know Testosterone. it is expended during ejaculating, as well as zinc, a precursor to testosterone. However, implications of excessive masturbation on testosterone have not been studied and we can only speculate. We try to keep these two chemicals in abundance to keep a positive outlook and full of energy.

If you don't get the superpowers, please, don't fret. You probably already have a well rounded lifestyle, such as sports or a solid girlfriend or whatever, your benefits from nofap will be less than say a cave-dweller. The super-powers are all very much(mostly) real. just because a testimony isn't like yours doesn't mean its not real. Lets all be nice to eachother :)

I covered what I could, whatever came to mind, sorry if it got messy I wrote it in fragments. What I'm saying is, you're going to learn a lot about yourselves. You're going to find a momentum in your life that you've been looking for.


 Happy New Year, I'm going all the way, I'll see you in April. Enjoy the adventure, ride the wave, and welcome to the movement.

I have had 6 wet dreams, failed on no porn (through gonewild or just watching it) 2 times, went through the baseline, some periods of extreme horniness, and now i'm finally feeling normal.

1. It has to be a big life change. I failed at 50 days before during the summer but this time I went hard at the gym, completely changed my diet, quit smoking pot, and started getting a 4.0 in school (3.0 student). The energy, time, and motivation from nofap allows you to excel in the other aspects of your life. You will seek constant improvement and the positives associated with growth, because you are no longer mentally stagnant. Seeking real girls is much more fun than images/videos on the internet.
2. Yes it really does work. I would always think about doing things and never go for it. I'd think about a girl in my class for a whole semester and never muster up the courage to say shit, while imagining what it would be like to date her. In the past few months of no fap I've had a steady dating relationship (That I ended because of lost of interest) and approached countless girls. There are 15 new numbers in my phone. Two girls in my classes I did approach, 1 gave me her number and 1 had a boyfriend. It's no longer about fear of rejection, because I have none. Just a slight nervousness and then I realize it feels good EVEN if I get rejected because I tried. 
3. The motivation from stopping helped me to get a job. I also lost 3% body fat, got visible abs, made about 30-40% weight gain on all my major lifts in the gym, and am able to run faster and with better endurance. 
4. There is no magic day you hit where you realize you have suddenly become the man. It is a gradual life change, a subtle shift of perspective that is only perceptible to you. One day you wake up and you just feel great for some reason.. then you realize you have felt that way for a week. A month. Happiness is all about disposition and how you choose to respond to what happens around you. 
5. After passing baseline and extreme horniness, it became less about nofap to get some bedroom acrobatic action. I am now at the point where I notice beautiful girls, but am really seeking a solid woman over something only physical. My relationships have become about love, and I can express myself a thousand times more easily. My family relations are better than ever and I feel more thoughtful of others (while caring less about what they think about ME. I love me, I trust me.)

Aged 19 now and I want to quit.,thescienceguy96,252,41,82,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/12is9v/owner_of_porn_cartel_has_been_using_porn_since/,"Hello. Yesterday was my first day in front of my own computer where I did not use porn. 

I have used porn before the internet became mainstream- I used to steal adult DVDs from my friend's house and burn them onto the family computer (encrypting the files, of course)  and then make copies to sell them on to friends in my primary school. It was my first real money maker; I must've made &gt;£30 in my first week just from selling these DVDs to kids as young as eight when I was ten years old. £30ish was a crap load of money to the ten year old me and I had no idea what to do with it so I kept my stash in a shoebox under my bed and never touched a £5 note of it.

The adrenaline rush of bringing something like ten hardcore porn DVDs into school every day to sell in the playground was almost as good as the content itself. I had my regular customers, mainly eleven year olds, who were always the first to buy the DVDs and as a result I became very popular. It was brilliant knowing that I was the one at the centre of all of this. That I was the mastermind of my own little 'DVD cartel'. It was a cartel. I ended up with people working for me selling my 'product'.

I reckon I earned a good average of £10-15 a week from this over the course of around six months (before I got caught...)

Before I divulge into how I got caught I must first tell you what led up to that miserable event. 
I have two schools in the town I live in- a primary school and a secondary school. At the time I was in primary school, my older cousin was in the secondary school. I told him about my mini 'cartel' and he was interested, very interested. 
Being the naturally sexually inquisitive 13 year old (with all his friends and their friends) he decided he would ""extend"" my business to the far larger market of horny teenagers. 

It was amazing. The first week I must've sold thirty or so DVDs at £3 each. That's £90. My cousin and I worked under a 50:50 split. 
It was like exponential growth. My cousin 'employed' his friends to sell DVDs to the neighbouring town's schools and the 'market' exploded. 
I must've been earning an average of £30 a week and it was brilliant- up until the point where the computer shop I was buying from started asking questions. 

Looking back on it, it was highly suspicious that a ten year old was buying a pack of 50 DVDs a week with paper money on a very regular basis however it wasn't that which got me caught.
The computer store's owner caught his son with one of MY porn DVDs and now I, and anyone who was of 'questionable age' was barred from buying optical media from the one and only shop.

This is where the 'cartel' began to crumble. 
Since my cousin's dad owned a computer (with a porn blocker on) he was able to go online and buy DVDs in bulk with what he didn't tell me was his dad's stolen credit card. This was fantastic; we got the DVDs cheaper than in store and in greater volumes! It was fantastic until my cousin's dad noticed the strange cash withdrawals and what made it even worse was the fact my cousin confronted his dad with about £100 to pay for the DVDs to which point my cousin was asked ""Where the hell he got that type of money from!?"".

His room was searched and about 50 porn DVDs were found in there, alongside about £200. We were busted.

I received a desperate phone call from my cousin who was in tears. In the background was vicious shouting and blaming of both parents by one another. He told me ""My Dad found the DVDs and the money and they're going to call your parents"" before abruptly hanging up. I was in utter shock and I curled into a ball and started crying. I had like £400 saved from the 'DVD cartel' and other earned money in that shoebox and I knew my parents would find it, alongside the DVDs.

I ran downstairs and retrieved a dustbin bag and as fast as I could I slung all the DVDs in there. I then buried them in the garden under a christmas tree.

Of course my room was raided and the DVDs were never found but I was grounded for about four months and my money was confiscated and put into a secure 18+ childs saving bank account by my parents. They contacted the schools in the area and asked if anyone had been caught with 'adult' material recently and my parents were told people had been. My parents watched my disgustingly hardcore DVDs  from my cousin (which made my mother cry) and the ones confiscated by the school and they were obviously identical. My parents have never looked at me in the same way since that.

So what has made me bring all this up? I remembered that sack of DVDs I buried. The christmas tree had long been removed from the garden so I found a shovel from the garage and started digging around the tree stump. I felt like I was digging up a long murdered corpse from my past. I kept digging until *crunch*, I had hit the DVD bag.

I counted 46 DVDs in there and I found one which worked. I was shocked at how hardcore the content was and I felt deep shame knowing I pushed this type of stuff to eight year olds. 

This shame is what is making me want to quit porn entirely and therefore cut down on masturbation.

As for the money, I am going to try to access that to buy myself my first moped.

I have to admit, when I found out he was jacking off a lot behind my back and avoiding having sex with me, I wasn't very pleased. It made me feel really bad about myself as well.
After about the 5th time we fought about it, he told me about something called Nofap. I was kind of weirded out by what he explained it to be. I didn't want to go without sex for 3 months. But he did it and I am so proud of him.
I wanted to tell you all that you are doing a great job. Even if there are relapses, at least you are trying to get out of the ""porn pit"". I understand how hard it can be.
But don't give up. 
When my husband ""nofap"" was over everything was so much better. All the secrets were gone and it felt like he enjoyed sex  a lot more.
My self esteem also went up because I felt like I could finally please him.
It is all worth it in the end. I'm not saying porn is an ""evil"" thing, but it can be if you let it control your life.
Thanks guys, for helping my husband and our relationship.

I write this not because I hate you but because I love you. Our man-to-hand relationship goes as far back as I can remember. You were there for me through many ups and downs. Perhaps a bit too many ups and downs. The first time you got kicked, I felt the pain. The first time you erupted with pleasure, I felt euphoric. Our bond is stronger than anything else in the world and that is exactly why our relationship needs to change.


I feel as if I am doing a disservice to you holding onto you as tightly as I do. We need space. ...Don't get me wrong, it's not you, it's me. See my eyes have been wandering, watching things they shouldn't watch. What have I been watching? Drugs, visual opiates that have taxed my system and have affected every fiber of my being, including you. I have become an addict and I have been abusing you for years. I know that you don't mind, you will always be there for me, but the changes are apparent. 


You no longer tingle when a beautiful female walks by. You always used to tingle. Just looking up has become a chore for you. You used to be an emotional beast, chiming in with your thoughts in the most unexpected of occasions. I know we have been working on that one for a while, but sometimes I miss the old you. Like that one time you announced yourself in Biology class. People noticed... but I wasn't even that mad. Now though, it's as if you are totally indifferent. I have to shake you vigorously just to get you to cry.  


NoFap is something that I know you hate buddy. But you can't equate this to a strike, I am not trying to fire you or keep you from doing your job. Think of this as a vacation. I need to clean myself up. I need to stop indulging myself in the darker things, the things that rob you of your vigor or me of my soul. The process is difficult. We have tried it before but always failed. But we need to be serious this time. I don't want to end up like one of those addicts in those long overcoats, going into shady businesses, doing those horrible things, just so we can find our next fix. 


I am just asking for some time. We both could use it. Maybe we will grow apart a bit. Maybe you will make new friends. Actually I hope that you will make new friends. Close friends. Someone who will take all you have to give. Someone who will laugh when you cry, wipe away your tears, and cover you when you are cold. But these things will only come with distance and time. 


I wish I could promise you that I will not fail you this time. Just know that I will do my best. Things will be rough but this is what we must do. Just know, I love you buddy.

So, here's the story. This past weekend I went on a mission trip to an Indian Reservation. It was from Thursday to Monday. There were about 130 kids from my school (in California) that went and 40 from our sister school (in Nevada). The Thursday we left was my ninth day since relapsing, so I was feeling pretty good, and was excited about being forced to last another 5 days. Anyways, when we got to the campsite where we were staying, I saw this girl from the other school who was one of the prettiest girls I had ever seen. Way prettier than any girl I would normally try to talk to. Of course, she was put on the work team I was on (the 170ish kids were split into teams of about 15), so I spent Thursday to Saturday just looking at her (I'm super introverted, btw) and wishing I could go talk to her. Then on Sunday we had a little bonfire set up, and I was hanging out with my friends by the bonfire, and she was with her friends. After some time all her friends left, and she was just standing there alone, so I gathered the courage to just go say hi and start a conversation with her. It was literally the hardest thing I've ever done, being an introvert, but I did it, and we had a great conversation, and the next day, before we left the campsite she handed me a scrap of paper with her number on it! I was walking on air at that point. I can't even describe how happy I was. Sorry for typing out this wall of text, but it was a huge success for me, and I attribute it to having not fapped for 12 days by that time. Today is my 14th day, and I am inspired more than ever to persevere on.

If anyone says that sex, in itself, is bad, Christianity contradicts him at once. But, of course, when people say, “Sex is nothing to be ashamed of,” they may mean “the state into which the sexual instinct has now got is nothing to be ashamed of.”

If they mean that, I think they are wrong. I think it is everything to be ashamed of. There is nothing to be ashamed of in enjoying your food: there would be everything to be ashamed of if half the world made food the main interest of their lives and spent their time looking at pictures of food and dribbling and smacking their lips. 

I do not say you and I are individually responsible for the present situation. Our ancestors have handed over to us organisms which are warped in this respect: and we grow up surrounded by propaganda in favour of unchastity.

She almost never came. Me? Always. 

I know there is a lot of debate within this subreddit about hard science and what's true and what's not true and while healthy debate is always a good thing, I know what's true for me. 

What's true for me is that daily masturbation has effectively turned me off to the world. 

What's true for me is that frequently watching pornography has played a part in making me a less-than-fantastic and less-than-enthusiastic lover. 

What's true for me is that the two combined have helped warp, twist, and distort the way I interact with women, my bedroom behavior, and the way I conduct myself in relationships. 

What's also true for me is that this way of escaping has become no longer feasible. It is no longer an option.

* I'm in a better shape that I've ever been (lifting like a monster);

* Brain fog is almost non existent;

* Been dating a smart, sexy, cute, artistic girl for two months now (for the first time in my life) and from what I can tell, she's really happy with me;

* Have no urges to PMO;

* My concentration skills have risen. I'm finally finishing projects I set out to do a long time ago;

* Almost unshakable emotional state;

* Control over my sexuality (because I've been doing karezza with her for a month now.. and, well, the willpower is rock solid. When it get's too hot, I have the power to stop. No questions asked.)

* Increased clearness of mind;

* Success in workplace- I have been praised as one of the best in the team;

* The playful tiger is returning- I can play with my girl wrestling like games, have fun. Bite her. Tease her. Pin her to the bed and stuff.

* Increased perspective- I'm starting to plan ahead my budget, career, how to fulfill the things I've been dreaming about.

NoFap Cheat codes:

CTRL+C+...

* NO TOUCHING - There is no chance I'm touching my penis (except when urinating or washing up).

* EAT CLEAN - The diet is simple: whole grains, dairy products, chicken, fruits, vegetables and the like. No white bread, no chips, no sugary drinks, no alcohol, no smoking, no drugs.

* TAKE OUT THE TRASH- mindfulness meditation. Nuff said.

* Psycho-cybernetics - Creating a picture of myself in my mind, so the outer world can't do it for me. It want's to put me in a box. And I won't let it.. ""Life is not about finding oneself, it's about creating oneself."" 

* NO ESCAPING REALITY- Limit my exposure to artificial stimuli (digital music, TV, movies). In this way starting to experience the is-ness of life. It may be a bit frightening at the beginning - sitting in complete silence with ones own thoughts... but, I have an understanding, that there's too much noise in the system - so much so, that we hardly hear our own soul talking to us anymore.

* NUTRITIONAL SUPPLEMENTS - There's a cool Australian movie called ""Food matters"". It's about the research that leads to the understanding, that our bodies need certain nutrients and vitamins, and if some of them are lacking, there might appear some problems in health - physical and emotional.

* LIFTING HARD CORE - Everything grows with pressure. I intentionally lift weights that make me all red and sh*t. No lifting the little dumbbells, that simply pump the muscles full of blood but don't add real strength. I know a lot of guys who are skinny as hell, but they are strong like beasts. I'm becoming one of them - and I kinda like the fact, that no-one really suspects the rising strength in my body. Not to mention - GF loves it too, that I can lovingly overpower her.

* SAUNA - Sweat all the garbage out of the system. A proven, ancient recipe for health and well being.

* LIVING ALONE OR HAVING PERSONAL SPACE- Having a place to call home.. where there's peace and harmony. No stupid distractions and superficial BS.

Still have a long way ahead of me.

1. **Give someone a genuine compliment** They are free and we don't give them out enough. Some us of us struggle with confidence so be part of the solution.
2. **Smile at a Stranger** You will feel better and most people enjoy the fact that someone they don't know noticed them. 
3. **Look around and realize how (blessed/luck) you are**
4. **Exercise** It will keep your mind off of PMO, but more importantly your body is one of the few things you truly own.
5. **Finish what you set out to do** This one is truly important, you need to make sure that you have the self control and drive to finish what you want to do, it will help you in so many ways, one of which is get PMO under control.
6. **Read the News** Be an informed individual, plus reading the news these days should make anyone realize how truly pathetic sitting in front of a screen and touching yourself is, people are dying...live vicariously for those who can't.
7. **Meditate** Enjoy the clearness of mind and soul you can achieve while participating in No Fap.
8. **Enjoy something small** These small moments are out there all the time and they can brighten your day. Plus these moments are part of the Human Experience, use them to push away from PMO.
9. **Learn from any failure you might have** Shit happens, don't let it happen for naught. No one is perfect, but that is not an excuse to let yourself fail over and over again. Failing is one of the greatest lessons you can get.
10. **Remember that some day you will die** Seems bleak, but for me it gives me strength, I want to die living a full life, not one that was partly wasted in front of a computer looking at images of things that will never happen. **Be active on how you will leave the world when you go** 

Well those are my life rules, I hope they help, and if they don't seem to have much to do with No_Fap, well that's because I've come to see No_Fap not as a way to stop a bad habbit, but a kick start to living better as a whole.

**edit** Some people have disagreed on the news part, and I can totally see where they are coming from. These are my personal views, but please change them if you'd like too.

I feel your pain. And for those of you who are considering seeing a prostitute, please for the love of all that is holy, read on.

Now a little bit about myself. I'm in my late 20's, went to a university with surplus of single, intelligent, and beautiful women without so much as a peck on the cheek. I knew in my heart of hearts that I would never get laid, and would likely die a virgin; being acutely suicidal exacerbated this idea. When I was 20 I set out to lose my virginity.

I don't know why I chose her, perhaps out of desperation and self-pity. I was still of the opinion that no beautiful woman would want to have sex with me, even for $400 US (oh how i was wrong.) I found her on Craigslist, back when they still advertised adult services. Her pictures made her seem much more attractive than she was. When I arrived at the seedy motel in LA l walked by a shady individual who I later imagined had seen her immediately before I did. I'm not sure of this, but it's too late to change my mind now.

She was... much shorter, and much fatter than I was anticipating. She had a nose ring and looked like white trash. The thought of backing out and just leaving didn't cross my mind, I would have in hindsight, but I didn't and I'll have to live with it. I lost every virginity I had to offer that night. She was the first girl I had ever kissed, my first blowjob, my first cunnilingus, my first vaginal sex in every position i could recall from every porno I had ever seen, and my first anal sex.

After growing so accustomed to what we call the death grip, i couldn't finish with her. She insisted I finish but I insisted I wouldn't be able to and just left when my hour was up. I can't describe the regret, shame, and humility I felt on the drive back home that fateful summer night. What was supposed to be a pivotal, momentous, and memorable night in a man's life was just wasted away on a prostitute.

Instead of learning my lesson, I doubled down. I went on a quest for the best sex of my life. I saw another prostitute later that week which turned out to be worst than the first. This one was an attractive, semi-young, petite blonde, (I was hell-bent on not making the same mistake I made with the first.) She wouldn't let me kiss her or even touch her, probably the worst experience ever.

Since that week, I've seen 80-90 prostitutes. I don't know why I've seen so many, but it's set me back quite a bit financially (I estimate anywhere between $30,000-40,000.) I'm trying to stop. I deleted every account I have on every escort review website I could think of. I threw away my burner phone I used to communicate with them, I deleted every contact I could find. The urge to see a prostitute grows exponentially the further I get in the nofap challenge. But I'm going to try.

Now for the important part, why you shouldn't make the same mistake I made. The damage you'll do to your psyche, your self-esteem and sense of self-worth will be irreparable. The thought of contracting an STD (hasn't happened yet, thank God.) is so frightening it will cripple you. Your conscious will prevent you from sleeping with a real woman for fear of passing on what unnamed diseases you've contracted. The guilt of potentially contributing to the demand of human trafficking will make you sick to your stomach. The money you spent will make you realize how much of that could have gone towards self-improvement, clothing, cars, gifts for family, and especially to charity.

All I'm saying is this: it's better to die a virgin, than to die a john. Don't let anyone fool you, just because it's so common and ""the world's oldest profession,"" doesn't make it right. As an atheist I can attest to how objectively immoral this is, if not to the woman, than at least to you. It's immoral to treat yourself that way, and especially wrong to see a woman with a price-tag around her neck.

TL;DR; Die a virgin before seeing a prostitute. Save your money, travel the world, go cliff-diving, sky-diving. It's the worst thing you can possibly do to yourself and the rest of humanity.

Similarly, if I have been free of porn for a stretch, and a nice fap sounds good, my brain will say, ""Go ahead, as long as you don't associate it with porn, we are just trying to avoid the mental pollution that porn brings. A little masturbation is healthy."" But this nearly always leads to a relapse into porn in the next couple days.

This breeds all kinds of messed up...,OnlyMereImmortal,258,54,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xmbw9/porn_is_other_people_having_sex_and_you_watching/,"Think about that. How healthy can that be to watch other people have fun, always yourself being a non-participant?

Honestly it can't be all that good. IDK about you, but I was starting to get somewhat messed up in my view of sexuality.

It feels scary admitting it, and I'll probably delete this comment, but I had started to place myself as the girl in the videos more and more. You might think I'm gay, or bi, but the honest truth is that I never notice guys or men in real life, just girls. Not turned on by gay porn either. So what the hell? Why did I begin to be turned on by thinking of myself as having sex with guys? I'm not a virgin, have a girl, and never had erectile problems, just loss of interest.

Honestly I believe it was due to porn. It reinforced for many years my self-placed beta-position of a watcher and non-participant, and so it became that I began to think of myself as someone who will NEVER be able to do that to girls, and to instead become the girl even in my thoughts. Weird kind of sublimation, the burying of active desire into passive receiving of both images and scenes and imaginary jizz, perhaps because it's easier to imagine being a participant that way. The girls always go for other guys in porn, never you. All hot girls go for other guys. Maybe I should go to these guys too... This is messed up, and it might be that I'm wrong about not even being bi, but I don't think so. I just know that if I go even a few weeks without porn, without seeing other penises touching hot girls, this strange feeling abates more and more, and my straightness re-emerges.

I would like to teach you something that is helping me immensely. I have a personal interest in NLP (neuro linguistic programming) and one of the key concepts in NLP is to focus on what you want rather than what you don't want. Because our brain can't handle the word ""Don't"" it skips it. Let me explain:

If I would type here **DON'T THINK OF A POLAR BEAR**. Don't see a polar bear in your mind. Don't imagine a polar bear walking in the snow. And for the love of god don't think of the baby polar bears that just popped up in your mind as you read that sentence. You would not be able to think of nothing else even if I encouraged you not to think about it. 

As you read what you weren't suppose to think about, you thought about it, because otherwise you wouldn't be able to understand what you just read. So, when we go around thinking that we ""DON'T want to fap"" what is it that our brain is occupied with really? Yes, thoughts of fapping. This makes the process harder. 

Another example, If I think that I DON'T want to be lonely, my behaviour will change according to that wish. The thing I'm concerned with is that I'm lonely, and then perhaps I become desperate our clingy in order to sort that out. 

But if I think that ""I want to be a good boyfriend"" the thing I'm concerned with is ""good boyfriend"" and my behaviour will change according to that wish, and hopefully that will take care of my lonely problem as well but in a better way. 

So don't walk around thinking about how you don't want to relapse, focus on what you DO want, perhaps it's a girlfriend, or a better physique, or a better job, and use your mental energy on that, because being concerned with the things you DON'T want will only make you expose yourself to that anyways.

The first 20 days were tough, after that initial period I fully realised I'd set this goal and was going to complete it, therefore I wasn't tempted again.

Porn was a different matter. When I started this I just took it at face value as ""no fapping for 90 days"", so I never internalised the goal of not looking at porn, which lead to looking at porn fairly regularly. I didn't touch myself, I just watched it.

On the occasions I didn't look at porn for a week or more, I found myself more stimulated by non-pornographic situations/images. I also had really strong urges to look at porn. I think cutting it out is far more important than not masturbating.

On the community itself I found it demotivating. It feels cultish and a lot of the posts are cringe worthy, so I just avoided it for the duration.

I think I'll start a new challenge of masturbating but not looking at porn. I realised for the last 6 years I don't think I've masturbated without porn, at all.

So yeah, no benefits but I think I missed a key component of it. I am proud I did it though. People have praised my self discipline and I always thought to myself ""well, yeah, but I masturbate constantly"", so to know that I've conquered a vice is a good feeling.

I came across a cd that wound up having a hidden porn folder.  I took a quick look at it.  There were a few images that I vividly remember as my ""favorites"" from around that time.  Looking at them now, they seemed very disturbing.  The girl obviously was strung out on drugs.  Probably doing it in order to afford more.  It was sad.  I promptly closed the folder, copied out the non-porn files, ejected it and cracked it into the trash bin.   I got rid of a good  8 or 9 other CDs that were full of porn a few months ago.  It's funny; every time you crack a blank cd, little shards of the thin metal in the plastic flu out and float in the air like confetti.  Like it's some sort of celebration.

EDIT:  I managed to find volumes 5, 6, 7 and 9. Still looking for 1-4 and 8, which I think might be at a friend's house in my hometown 800 miles away from me. These tracks don't have any titles. I can't remember who made them, so they are just called Random Chiptune Compilations. It's a weird mix of original songs and covers from well known and obscure video games. They're from an archive of thousands of chiptunes composed using tracker programs which I downloaded from www.chiptune.com (which is surprisingly still in existence).

Read this.,8-Bits,238,34,81,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vx4py/just_starting_out_read_this/,"Hi there, I've been lurking in nofap for quite some time and I'm making this post to give tips and advice that could be useful for beginners and more experienced fapstronauts alike.

-Create yourself a golden rule that you will follow no matter what; no orgasm or something alike is probably not a good idea because you will end up edging and sooner or later this always leads to a relapse.
Something that seems to be working for me is ""I will not touch my penis for other things than basic hygiene and peeing"". This is good because it gives you a clear idea of what not to do and this is very helpful when your depleted brain tries to bargain its crack dose.

-If you do relapse, do not beat yourself up. Feeling bad about yourself will just make you more likely to seek porn as a source of comfort. Also do not succumb to the ""what the hell effect""; do not binge after a relapse in the long run it will just make things more difficult. The three days after a relapse will be tough but if you manage to do it you'll see that a single relapse won't have a very big effect on your overall recovery. (given that you do not binge of course).

-Do yourself a favor and install a porn filter, it can make the difference when your cravings are very high. Personally, I use openDns on my router; I know the password and could deactivate it at any time, but having to make these additional steps before being able to watch porn helps you reframe things.

-Beware of the vague definition of porn, what may have not excited you at the beginning of NoFap, will suddenly seem much more enticing when you will have a few weeks down the way. Do not fall into the trap of reproducing exactly the same behaviours with swimsuit models instead of pornstars. Whatever gets your dopamine rushing can be considered porn, even if there is no nudity present.

-Start doing it with a friend, this will be much more motivating and you can support each other during this difficult journey. You probably have many addicted friends; at least this is the case with almost every male of my generation.

-Replace your habit of masturbation with some physical activity; it will assist the healing process and help with any excess of nervous tension. I've been doing 30 minutes of yoga every day and it really helps with tension and anxiety.

-If you have other personal habits you want to change, complete nofap first. Willpower is a limited ressource and tackling to many things at once is very difficult to manage.

I hope this will be helpful to all the newcomers and if you anything to add do not hesitate.

#8 — Dopamine Makes You Addicted To Seeking Information

Do you ever feel like you are addicted to email or twitter or texting? Do you find it impossible to ignore your email if you see that there are messages in your inbox? Have you ever gone to Google to look up some information and 30 minutes later you realize that you’ve been reading and linking, and searching around for a long time, and you are now searching for something totally different than before? These are all examples of your dopamine system at work.

Enter dopamine – Neuro scientists have been studying what they call the dopamine system for a while. Dopamine was “discovered” in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Ake Hillarp at the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Dopamine is created in various parts of the brain and is critical in all sorts of brain functions, including thinking, moving, sleeping, mood, attention, and motivation, seeking and reward.

The myth — You may have heard that dopamine controls the “pleasure” systems of the brain: that dopamine makes you feel enjoyment, pleasure, and therefore motivates you to seek out certain behaviors, such as food, sex, and drugs.

It’s all about seeking — The latest research, though is changing this view. Instead of dopamine causing us to experience pleasure, the latest research shows that dopamine causes seeking behavior. Dopamine causes us to want, desire, seek out, and search. It increases our general level of arousal and our goal-directed behavior. (From an evolutionary stand-point this is critical. The dopamine seeking system keeps us motivated to move through our world, learn, and survive). It’s not just about physical needs such as food, or sex, but also about abstract concepts. Dopamine makes us curious about ideas and fuels our searching for information. The latest research shows that it is the opoid system (separate from dopamine) that makes us feel pleasure.

Wanting vs. liking – According to Kent Berridge, these two systems, the “wanting” (dopamine) and the “liking” (opoid) are complementary. The wanting system propels us to action and the liking system makes us feel satisfied and therefore pause our seeking. If our seeking isn’t turned off at least for a little while, then we start to run in an endless loop. The latest research shows that the dopamine system is stronger than the opoid system. We seek more than we are satisfied (back to evolution… seeking is more likely to keep us alive than sitting around in a satisfied stupor).

A dopamine induced loop – With the internet, twitter, and texting we now have almost instant gratification of our desire to seek. Want to talk to someone right away? Send a text and they respond in a few seconds. Want to look up some information? Just type it into google. What to see what your friends are up to? Go to twitter or facebook. We get into a dopamine induced loop… dopamine starts us seeking, then we get rewarded for the seeking which makes us seek more. It becomes harder and harder to stop looking at email, stop texting, stop checking our cell phones to see if we have a message or a new text.

Anticipation is better than getting — Brain scan research shows that our brains show more stimulation and activity when we ANTICIPATE a reward than when we get one. Research on rats shows that if you destroy dopamine neurons, rats can walk, chew, and swallow, but will starve to death even when food is right next to them. They have lost the desire to go get the food.

More, more, more – Although wanting and liking are related, research also shows that the dopamine system doesn’t have satiety built in. It is possible for the dopamine system to keep saying “more more more”,  seeking even when we have found the information. During that google exploration we know that we have the answer to the question we originally asked, and yet we find ourselves looking for more information and more and more.

Unpredictable is the key — Dopamine is also stimulated by unpredictability. When something happens that is not exactly predictable, that stimulates the dopamine system. Think about these electronic gadgets and devices. Our emails and twitters and texts show up, but we don’t know exactly when they will or who they will be from. It’s unpredictable. This is exactly what stimulates the dopamine system. It’s the same system at work for gambling and slot machines. (For those of you reading this who are “old school” psychologists, you may remember “variable reinforcement schedules”. Dopamine is involved in variable reinforcement schedules. This is why these are so powerful).

When you hear the “ding” that you have a text – The dopamine system is especially sensitive to “cues” that a reward is coming. If there is a small, specific cue that signifies that something is going to happen, that sets off our dopamine system. So when there is a sound when a text message or email arrives, or a visual cue, that enhances the addictive effect (for the psychologists out there: remember Pavlov).

140 characters is even more addictive – And the dopamine system is most powerfully stimulated when the information coming in is small so that it doesn’t full satisfy. A short text or twitter (can only be 140 characters!) is ideally suited to send our dopamine system raging.

Not without costs — This constant stimulation of the dopamine system can be exhausting. We are getting caught in an endless dopamine loop.

Write a comment and share whether you get caught in these dopamine loops and whether you think we should use what we know about these systems to create devices and websites that stimulate them.

So on Saturday, I go to work, had a shitty day at work because they're cutting my hours. So I'm feeling bummed out about my hours, so I go home and there's so much noise; family talking out loud, music blasting, and construction outside my house. I'm starting to feel that though pop into my head ""If I look at some porn, maybe it will make my day so much easier"" Yeah right, motherfucker! So I got up, changed out of my work clothes, take a shower and put something casual to look good. 

I headed to Barnes and Nobles to read, I'm looking for a little peace and quiet, so I could think more clearly without the stressful environment around me. I go to the magazine section, and order a passion tea to read along with it. I see this girl, and I sit in the same row as her with a nice view outside of the plaza. And the girl across from ask if I'm from around here, I said no I'm from New York, then she says ""yeah, I'm from New York too, do you know allen?"" I'm like WTF ""yeah I have a brother name Allen"" she's then said ""Oh my god, I went to high school with him"" Little did I know that this girl also knows my step father, my mom and my aunt.

I have to first say that this subreddit is such an excellent idea to have and such a help for those of us who want to improve in our self-control and discipline. I would advise that you use this subreddit as much as possible through your journey, and not only when you relapse. I've actually stayed away from fapping for a year and a half, it was so empowering knowing that I can and will achieve much greater than that. I know I just recently relapsed and I responded by telling myself that I was just gonna keep doing the same but just try harder this time. That's when I remembered a quote that says ""the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting a different result"". While this may or may not be true in some circumstances, when it comes to discipline and self-control we have to see what went wrong the last time we did relapse, and work on that mistake. Which brings me to why I'm writing this, I thought you all could use a few pointers that has helped me stay away from fapping:



****If you've relapsed, report it to NoFap or to a close friend, find out the reason why you did then state what you're going to do differently this time in order to avoid that mistake in the future****



This is to help you keep accountable to what you're doing. Humans have a natural tendency to be irresponsible if they're not held accountable. By reporting it to someone it also helps you gain encouragement and an outside perspective when you do discuss it with people or a person. *Those who think they can handle it and do it all on their own are usually the ones who fall the hardest*, it takes a lot of strength in character to be able to admit you have a problem or that you've messed something up, I look up to people who can and are willing to admit their problems. Keeping it to yourself is the easy route. However, after you've done this, you want to make sure you talk about what you're going to do differently this time. Make sure you state what you've learned from that mistake so you won't repeat it again. This helps give room for a *productive and forward thinking conversation*, instead of just basking in regret of your mistake. You'll start to think like a winner, and a determined person. We're all not perfect and we all experience problems and shortcomings, but I think the real winners are the one's who accept their mistakes, identify what went wrong, and proceed to fix it. It's how we learn, build, and perfect anything. So in sum **accept and identify that you did relapse, find out why you did relapse (in other words, what happened/preceded before you relapsed), and state a solution for that problem if you come across it again in the future.**



****Most of the battle in this journey will have to be won in your mind first****



Now this point is probably the biggest of all and has been the factor behind most of my successes in life period! You have to come to a decision about what kind of thoughts you want to think, and those thoughts will make you who you are. They become a part of your personality and behaviour. These thoughts eventually expand and form the type of person who you are or who you want to be. I'm not just saying this because it sounds nice, it's backed up by scientific evidence summed up in [Amy Cuddy's TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc). It's a bit of a lengthy video but trust me, it's totally worth it! That talk can help you in more ways than one, and is a gold mine for becoming and achieving anything you want to. This is basically done if you ""fake it, til you make it"". When you change your thoughts, your behaviour basically cannot help but become what you think. Don't feel confident? don't feel encouraged? don't feel like you'll last long? Forget all those thoughts! Fake your confidence, determination, and self-disciplin until you become it! Watch the [TED talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc), she sums it up way better.  

This brings me to my reason as to why you have to win the battle in your mind first is because you are driven to act like you think. This is also based in the psychological concept of [cognitive dissonance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance), which is basically a psychological discomfort you experience when your thoughts/cognition don't align with your behavior. So for example when you keep thinking about pornography/sex/masturbating, and at the same time trying to convince yourself that won't do it. You're straight up lieing to your self, your being dishonest. When you experience this, you have two options: change your thoughts or change your behavior. You can see more explanations or examples from this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=korGK0yGIDo). In simple terms, you're trying to take away the discomfort of your conflicting thoughts and behavior by changing one of two things: your thoughts or your behavior. 

This is the major battle with masturbating, you have to win this battle in your mind, and not just through good intentions alone. Don't deceive yourself and think you're just watching something NSFW and that you won't do anything, you're just deceiving yourself. And you don't wanna be a deceptive person, especially not to yourself. So conclude that the situation is bad for you period! Get that straight in your mind and don't get caught up in it, because human behavior doesn't work like that way. Decide from now on, that once a situation has pornography/nudity/your fetish/arousing conversations and thoughts, etc, it WILL lead you to relapse. If you don't take the time to figure this out, you'll be convincing yourself to act in a way that doesn't align with your behavior. You will then experience the cognitive dissonance, and will be compelled to change your behavior, to masturbate, in order to align with the arousing thoughts. So make the journey easy for you, don't make this harder than it needs to be. Take the path of least resistance and use that time to build up your strength, self-control, and discipline. 



****Change your reward system when you accomplish no fapping in a day, week, and month****



Here you have to change how you reward yourself, because maybe some of us tend think that ""since I've gotten this far i deserve a reward so I should fap/watch porn/look at some girls/boys online"". This is another fall into deception, because your body is going to try all kinds of ways to get back into the old routine of things. Instead, what you can do is change how you reward yourself. For example, you can go watch a movie/ eat at your favorite restaurant/ go shopping/ tell someone to hold your ps3/xbox until you've achieved a month without fapping. Whatever it is make sure the reward applies to you and your life, it has to be something that you consider valuable or a treat to yourself. You have to change the way you celebrate successes, and what you celebrate with. So you not only are controlling you're thoughts and what you say to yourself now, your also controlling what you're rewarding yourself with too. Wow, your actually REALLY taking control of your life now!

Set goals for yourself by the day, week, month...........no I'm serious, right them down right now!!! Get creative with yourself and put it in a calendar, mark off the dates, count down to the week/month/months/year. Get as involved into setting these goals for yourself as you can. Put it in your reminders. 



****Be realistic about the challenges, create ""avoidance routines"" routines****



When your making out this plan for yourself, be realistic and list all the possible obstacles and temptations you think you will face and that you've faced in the past. The point here is so that you won't be surprised when something doesn't go the way you expected. One thing in this journey is that you don't ever wanna be surprised, do you ever see army men surprised when they go into battle? No! Because they train for every possible situation, so when they actually experience the battlefield, they have all the set routines for situations they may face. You know why secret agents, army men, police, etc train for so long?? It's because the training is to help them come up with possible routines about possible problems they can face in their line of work. So sit down and come up with an action plan, training or ""avoidance routine"" just like them, listing each problem you can and WILL face, then come up with methods or routines of how you will escape or avoid these problems.



****The first part is always the hardest, but once you can get over that you can make it the rest of the way!****



When people start any task, learn a new skill or topic, or make life changes, it almost always goes good for the first period they commit. This is totally normal, and that's why you hear a lot people going so hard at first and ready to take on the world. That's the nice part about making these changes! but sadly this part will fade with time and that's when your body will begin to say ""alright, I've been out of my comfort zone for too long, it's time to go back to my normal routine"". This is when you'll start feeling all the urges and all the mental/physical strings tugging you get back to your old habits. I want you to know that this is totally natural and you will experience it like any normal human being. It's happening because your starving your body of something, so it's gonna fight back, it's not gonna go away without a fight in you. But it's not about size of the dog in this fight, it's about the size of the fight in the dog. In other words, how determined are you to fight for this self-discipline and to gain your trust back? if you really want it you'll have to implement some mindhacks called ""self talk"" and you'll have to keep your mind mentally focused on your goal and nothing else. [Wikipedia has an article on self talk here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrapersonal_communication), it's basically what kind of conversation you have with yourself inside your head. People in some social psychology experiments who have talked to themselves leaning to one point of view, have been seen to make decisions based on what they were thinking about. So learn this skill and you can get past this tough part combined with reducing cognitive dissonance. 



****It will take a while until you can trust yourself again, but for now you can't****



One thing you'll have to come to terms with is that you cannot trust yourself right now, because each time you convince yourself that you can be trusted not to fap, you relapse again.... again.... and maybe sometimes for numerous occasions. Don't make this cycle in your life, I'm sure you don't want that, you want to live life to the fullest and not just be in this repetitive cycle of relapses. So you have to also admit that you cannot trust yourself for now because of what has happened. It's nothing bad, it's just the reality of things. Trust is one of those things that is broken easily, but takes a while to build back up again. That's because it's a very valuable thing, and anything worth having in life, is worth fighting for. So fight for it, fight for this trust back and stop at nothing to build it back up again! I want you to be able to trust yourself, so take time with this, take it one day at a time. You'll see your confidence in yourself grow day by day, and week by week. This confidence is key to help you keep going. 

One of the downfalls of accomplishment is that when we achieve something or get over a milestone we tend to get cocky and pride seeps in. **DON'T DO THIS, it's like the start of your path back to relapse practically.** If you achieve let's say a week, reward yourself, but focus on the next prize and keep going. That's why it's good to set many goals and not just one ultimate goal. So in short, don't get all cocky once you start going stay humble and keep setting goals. 



****Hold yourself accountable by emailing your future self****



This is not something you necessarily need to do, but I think it's good to help you put most of your resources into helping yourself gain confidence, trust, and self-discipline. You can email your self through this [site called futureme.org](http://www.futureme.org/) and it lets you write an email to your self but you get to set the date you'll receive the email. So you can write a letter to yourself asking yourself and encouraging yourself in your journey hoping that your journey is going good and hoping that you accomplished a lot by that date. Make yourself accountable in the email, and put expectations that you hoped to have achieved by then.


These are some of my tips that i used to success, sorry it's a bit lengthy but i really hope they work for you. Leave me a comment below if you have questions. All the best in this journey, I know you'll make it, you have it in you! If nobody believed in you in this life, I do, and I'm here along with everyone else to support you through this journey.



**TLDR; A summary of the main points:**

* Admit that masturbating/pornography/lust,etc. is a problem you have, identify why it occurs (what happens that causes you to do it), and say what you'll do in order not to repeat that mistake. This creates a productive and ""forward thinking"" conversation instead of just complaining and living in regret.

* The battle you have to win is mostly in your mind. Who cares if you don't feel like how you should, ""fake it til you make it"" and reduce that cognitive dissonance.

* Change your reward system, and how you define rewards. Set rewards for a certain amount of days, weeks, months, and even for a year!

* Be realistic about the challenges you'll face and create ""avoidance routines"". All people in fields/sports/services that require discipline do it, so you should too ;)

* The first part is always the hardest, but once you can get over that you can make it the rest of the way!

* It will take a while until you can trust yourself again, but for now you can't. Trust, most importantly with yourself, takes time to build back. 

* Hold yourself accountable by emailing your future self! This will help you reflect on the kind of person you want to become at a later date, and be sure to state some expectations for yourself. This way you can't blame anybody or anything for not living up to the expectations, because these are your own expectations.

It's simply not worth it.",InRecovery,221,22,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1d3k4w/decided_to_relapse_on_purpose_to_see_if_my/,"Hello fellow Fapstronauts,

I purposefully relapsed today after engaging in NoFap for a week. At the end of the 7 day mark, I could clearly tell significant changes! My concentration was clearer, my self-confidence was considerably higher, and my productivity had far improved. I was in ""La La Land"" in all respects. In fact, I have come to enjoy the ""mental buzz"" of NoFap a whole lot more than the ""bliss"" of orgasm via fapping.

Out of sheer curiosity, I choose to relapse out of my own accord and see whether these new ""superpowers"" of sorts would diminish or not. I loaded an array of porn websites and completed the deed in my usual fashion. Within seconds after cumming, the phase shift in mental acuity that I felt was simply astounding. **It felt as though a fresh layer of fog had been draped over my mind. Almost immediately, I felt an overwhelming sense of apprehension, uneasiness, and dissatisfaction.**

**After my experimental relapse, I tried to return back to my homework and found that it was nearly impossible to stay on task.** I suddenly felt the urge to fap again, browse Imgur, check Facebook, clean my apartment, do the dishes, and basically every action except finishing the studies at hand. I went to my college campus later in the day to meet up with some friends and my sense of confidence had also stooped considerably. **I was significantly more hesitant to converse with other girls. In fact, projecting my usual upbeat attitude required a concerted effort that made me feel uncomfortable in my own skin.**

Long story short, my personal experience indicates that fapping does not carry any extended benefits in terms of quality of happiness. **While the act itself may be enjoyable when in the moment, the fall into that mental abyss of confusion and apprehension afterwards negates any and all forms of temporary bliss associated with this hideous act.**

Hence, I definitely feel a firmer resolve to fight my urges harder and grow as a person. **I feel that the longer I spend away from fapping, the more I respect the man whom I see in the mirror. Long story short, for the first time in my life, I feel like I can make a promise and actually deliver on that promise without any dilution or adulteration. =)**

Yeah, obviously it's cold. But i read about it yesterday, someone was taking a hardcore challenge with cold showers involved. I really thought: Oh my god, that is insane, why would anyone do THAT?

So i started googling about it, and there's something called cold shower therapy, which basically just says that taking cold showers will strengthen your willpower, and it really does!

Before i took the cold shower this morning, i sat on the bad tub for i while thinking why the hell i would do this and then i just did it.

At the moment itself, it sucked so bad, i had a hard time not screaming! My heart was pumping like mad, i was breathing like i just walked the marathon. It was just 5 minutes of hell.

But once i got out, it was amazing, my whole body felt great, i had a big smile on my face, and it's a big willpower trainer.

Also the nice thing about it, it doesn't cost you anytime, you would have taken a shower anyway! And afterwards it feels like you worked out for half an hour.

Two weeks ago I was at 30 days and was experiencing a real high in terms of the rewards I was receiving for my No Fap. I went out on one fine evening to an event in my town and was remarkably comfortable, relaxed and confident. It was like nothing I had experienced. So there I was sitting at this event and I saw this beautiful, impressive woman standing at the bar getting a drink. I recognized her from a poster and when I went to get my drink I just casually started talking to her. She took a real interest in me as I spoke and started to ask lots of questions....nice questions. 'Ah, It turns out that we were next door neighbors' she remarked cheekily. I was pretty blown away by her subtle flirtation on this first meeting. Later on I spoke to her again and she ended up inviting me for a drink with herself and her friends. That drink was interesting - by the end of the evening herself and her friend had purposefully moved to sit next to me and were just showering me with attention and compliments...it was the strangest experience. They started telling me that it was so obvious that I was in touch with my essence and inner power ?? This was a shocker.

The next meeting blew me away. She told me that she had been single for two years, that she had be focusing on herself entirely, had been with nobody during this time. She informed me that I was seriously courageous and bold to have approached her and she felt so 'immediately comfortable and relaxed' the moment I engaged with her. Little did she know that a month previous I would have been a quivering, anxiety ridden mess. That evening she abandoned herself to me.

The long and short of it is that we are now together and getting on like a house on fire.  The second night we hung out and fell into each others eyes deeply and have had some mind blowing experiences since. Our second sexual experience was virtually tantric and I had a no ejaculation, full body orgasm :O I have read that other fapstaunauts in hard mode have experienced similar things and these gifts are just the tip of the iceberg I believe.

I would NEVER have been able to approach a woman of this calibre before, and it is a testimony to the power of nofap that I am with such an incredible person and riding this wave. **Lastly, and this is beautiful, she knows I am going without masturbation or orgasm for a period of time and has told me she is so deeply satisfied with our connection that she doesn't mind we haven't had sex and has so much respect for me doing this. So hard mode continues and a great deal of pleasure during our lovemaking is in making her orgasm. This is such a turn on -  all my sexual energy going into pleasuring her...the response from her has been, well, as you can imagine - highly positive ;)**

**UPDATED**
Hey everyone, thanks for reading and sharing your input. I wanted to touch on several things, and I figured updating the post was the best and most efficient way to do so.  
* First off, the awesome title of the post was inspired by words of wisdom from a character on HBO's How to Make It in America. It felt applicable to our journey to improve ourselves through NoFap.  
* The main reason I wrote this post was to show how simple it can be to approach someone we're interested in, as long as we have a definitive goal, an organized plan, and the right attitude. We often over-think things and make them more complicated than they need to be.  
*  The goal, as eloquently stated in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/19n6s9/nobody_owes_me_love/) and many other great posts in this subreddit is to connect emotionally and mentally with a person we're physically attracted to. One thing I think we can all agree on is that porn has made our society objectify women. In order to break away from that mentality, we need to modify our goals. The goal, when approaching a woman, should be to get to know her as a person, with the hope of forging a relationship, whether it is friendly or romantic.  
* **Courage and confidence are qualities that are built.** Most people are not inherently audacious and do not ooze with confidence. Only through small daily acts and little successes can one build courage and confidence. Personally, I feel more confident when I have a goal and a plan.  
* The Law of Attraction is definitely pseudo-science. There is no scientific proof of the validity of this thought process, and in physics, positive charges are attracted to negative charges. I read the first 10-15 pages of the Secret, and I wasn't a big fan. However, I'm currently reading Napoleon Hill's Think and Grow Rich, and I do believe our thoughts are extremely powerful. I used ""the law of attraction"" to get a point across - that being: when you show someone genuine interest, they tend to reciprocate it, or at the very least, appreciate the flattery. That's human nature. Try it out and you'll see.  
* It was a long update, and I wish everyone the best of luck on his/her journey.  ",,False,,t5_2skrn,1362504778.0,,month7,True,t3_19makz,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/19makz/he_who_hesitates_masturbates/,

1340341750.0,194,self.NoFap,vf82f,"This isn't about fapping. This is about self control. If you want to stop fapping, you have to exercise self control in other domains.",JihadDerp,215,21,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/vf82f/this_isnt_about_fapping_this_is_about_self/,"The highest value here is self control. Fapping is just one branch on that tree you need to master. 

Self control is a muscle in the brain. The more you exercise it in other domains, the better you can wield it against heavy obstacles like fapping. 

For example, I'm a huge drinker. When I drink, I like to drink a lot and get fucked up. When I go out to drink with people, I don't like to have 1 or 5. I like to have a lot. But I also wanted to become a master of myself. So I decided I would go out with a drinking group one night and be the DD. It was hard, but I did it. I had the resolve to be in control. If I can't control this, I can't control fapping. If I can't control fapping, I can't control my life.

Another example: working out. I used to work out until I was tired and then stop. But then I looked up a regiment and decided to follow through no matter what. It was fucking HARD. I had to do 3 sets more than I usually did in a variety of different exercises. But each painful rep of each painful set, I told myself this is me, in control. If I can't control this, I can't control fapping. If I can't control fapping, I can't control my life.

A different type of example: doing simple things better. For example, driving and cleaning. While driving, I make a conscious effort to stay as close to the middle of the lane I'm in as possible. I try to drive the same exact speed consistently. I make sure to signal at least 5 seconds before I turn or merge, and to keep my blinker on until I'm fully done the maneuver. While cleaning, I make a conscious effort to do it up to what I imagine would be military standards. I imagine some fucking asshole yelling at me for missing a little hair on the sink after I shaved, or a piece of lint on the carpet after I vacuumed. I make my bed tight. All this carries over into good posture and dressing nicely and presenting myself a certain way to people. If I can't control these, I can't control fapping. If I can't control these, or fapping, I'm not in control of my life.

It's about self control. Fapping is just one aspect of that. Control everything else, and fapping will come much easier.

A quote I read on reddit a while back that set the stage for this mindset was in /r/motivation or some subreddit like that: ""If you can't handle doing the dishes when you're supposed to, what makes you think you can handle a Fortune 500 company?"" That hit me fucking hard.

If you can't control the little things, you can never control the big things, and that proves you don't control your life. Don't you want to control your life?

Do I plan to continue? I'm not sure. It'd feel weird to fap again after so long of not, but fighting it all the time does get tiring and I have developed a new mindset over the last year. My goal was originally to make it three months, then I moved to six, then nine, now twelve.

If I do fap, I'm definitely laying down some guidelines. A lot of you will probably disagree with me on these, but that's fine. These are just my personal opinion:

1. Only fap at night/end of the day. Orgasm during the morning/day often makes you feel lethargic for the rest of the day and make you unmotivated/lazy. Fapping before bed once you've already got everything out of the way and can relax makes much more sense to me now.

2. Reduce the amount of times you fap. 2-3 times a week tops. Multiple times a day is where it gets problematic and unhealthy.

3. Restrict porn. This is a verrryyy hard one. The male brains loves nothing more than watching an absolutely gorgeous girl get fucked - I'll be the first to admit it. I've fapped before without it as we all have, but as we know it's a lot more boring not having that visual stimulation. We're guys and we're very visual creatures. If not cutting it out, at least reducing the explicitness of it. It's a tough one and you have to be very careful as it could lead you back down the rabbit hole you spent so long climbing out of.

4. Changing your mindset while watching porn. If you're in a relationship (like me) it can be very easy to develop negative expectations on what sex should be like or what your girlfriend/boyfriend should act or look like. Girls in porn are almost always chosen based on their looks, a lot of them are downright gorgeous. It can be very easy to become dissatisfied with your significant other, whether it's looks or performance based on what you see in porn. Remember porn is just a 'fantasy' as such, they get paid to have sex and get paid to look beautiful. It's not just in porn either, it's everywhere; advertising, movies, tv, the internet, reddit. Enjoy porn for what it is but never lose sight of your SO's beauty or what made you fall in love with them in the first place. Keep your head in the real world.

5. Become multi-orgasmic or learn to orgasm without ejaculation. Yes it's possible - the ancient Chinese based a lot of their sexual theory/practices by making the male focus on abstaining from ejaculation. Step 1: more kegels!

6. Never put masturbation ahead of sex. If you know you're going to get laid in a day or two, then don't fap for those days. You'll be much hornier if you wait and more likely to excite the other person/have more passionate sex because of it. It'll also be much more rewarding for you!

For the past few weeks I have been mustering up the courage to approach girls. It's been a major battle for me since I have been a big introvert and trying to break out of my shell.

Saw a cute girl sitting at the bar, but unfortunately, I was sitting behind her out of her peripheral vision. So I did what any guy would do, I went outside around the back and walked in front of the store and pretended I was just walking past. I went inside the store and said: ""excuse me, i saw you from outside, thought you were cute and I would regret it all day if I didn't say hi to you. Hi!"" 

Her reaction was amazing. She giggled, smiled and introduced herself. She just graduated from college a year ago (I just graduated in May), found out she's a swimsuit/lingerie model along with a bunch of other jobs. We talked, I asked for her number and she said give me your number and let me decide if I want to call you, so I gave her my number and a big hug, and left. Who knows if she'll call me or get in touch with me again, but who cares! Yay for killing approach anxiety! I was so nervous in the beginning my heart was racing, but eventually that subsided cause I realized I needed to pay attention to what she was saying.

Also, I had a giant pimple on my nose. DGAF.

EDIT: lolol forgot to mention this was at starbucks during the day. i just read through it again and it seems like i was at a bar. coffee bar :)

1350669524.0,191,self.NoFap,11rbb8,I went to a wedding...,Possibru,225,34,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/11rbb8/i_went_to_a_wedding/,"So this past week I went to a wedding. I was busy practicing since I had to play piano for most of the ceremony. I was at the rehearsal dinner and saw so many old faces. There were a bunch of friends I haven't seen in a while. A lot of girls were there. This was the night before the wedding so I should have cleaned up a little. I looked like a bum. Hair was everywhere and I didn't shave. But for some reason I was confident. I was shaking hands, looking people in the eyes, making people laugh and just being a pretty social guy. For some reason I just felt so... Alpha for lack of a better word. I went home that night pumped for no reason.

Fast forward to the wedding day I cleaned up as much as I could. I was so nervous because of all the people that would hear me play. Everyone ended up loving what I played and I was getting compliments all day. I wasn't worried about the ladies because I was just happy that day. But there were so many pretty girls there. Like way too many. I would notice girls looking at me but I tried not to get my hopes up.

After the reception, there was a party at my friends house. A girl was there who was a 9/10. I was pretty good at keeping eye contact with others but I just couldn't look her in the eyes for long periods of time. Her eyes were so piercing. When I would talk to her she looked at me like she wanted to eat me. I would look away and she would just stare. I found out later that she was asking everyone about me. She wasn't the only girl that was into me.

 My friends kept telling me about all of these girls that were in love with me, thought I was hot blah blah. I started getting text messages from my female friends, commenting on how good I looked. I've been working out too so people have been talking about my physique too. There's just been so much happening and it's hard to really put it all down so I apologize if it sounds choppy. Today I've beaten my previous streak. I'm not waking up early and having energy like last time, but I can still see benefits even if they're different.

It all started on Monday, when I saw [a YouTube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABgL2LcoBTU) posted on /r/getmotivated about some guy who approaches a beautiful girl in a store and simply asks ""Are you single?"" The girl's positive reaction served as an inspiration for me, and I decided to try it in real life. 

Tuesday I went to a clothes shop at the local mall to buy a jacket. As I walk in there with confidence and a smile upon my face, the girl in there says ""You look like you know what you want,"" with a smile on her face. ""Yes, I do,"" I said. I told her I wanted a jacket and she started showing me jackets. Taking a deep breath I then asked her casually ""Are you single?"" while looking at her with a smile.

She starts giggling, before she tells me (exact quote): ""I do have a boyfriend, but I wish I wasn't in a relationship."" She continued to look at me. - ""What about you? Do you have a girlfriend?""

""Y-no,"" I answered. For some reason I was about to say 'yes' to that question, but quickly changed it to 'no'. That got her intrigued.

""That was an interesting answer,"" she said. I said something about that I used to be in a long relationship, but not anymore (a lie; that relationship ended years ago). Then we spent some time trying jackets, keeping a friendly conversation. I bought a jacket at a bargain price, along with some socks, which I playfully dropped down on the counter next to her. That made her giggle. 

When I left the store, her male colleague gave me thumbs up while she looked the other way.

Today (Friday) I was on a supermarket at the same mall, shopping beer and groceries for the weekend. As I stand in line to the cashiers, I see this beautiful, young brunette with ice-blue eyes sitting behind my cashier. I load my groceries onto the conveyor belt and patiently wait for my turn. She greets me, I greet her. She scans my groceries. She tells me how much it is. 

""I'll use my card,"" I say and swipe my card. Then I ask her confidently (but casually): ""Are you single?"" I smile to her. 

""What?"" she asks, looking at me in something looking like disbelief. 

""Are you single?"" I repeat with the same confidence. 

""Yeah..."" she asks with a smile and a downward gaze, charmingly geeky, almost guffawing, even twisting a little bit in her chair. 

""You wanna go on a date with me?"" I ask her. She looks at me with that same guffawing demeanor. 

""I work so much, almost every day,"" she replies, her voice thickening a bit as if she's about to start giggling (or groaning). 

""We'll take each day as it comes,"" I answer cool and casual. - ""Have a nice day, A[...]."" Her name tag is fully visible on the left side of her chest. 

""You too,"" she says. I pack my groceries, bid her goodbye and leave the store with a big smile on my face. 

**At the very same day**, when I enter the gym, I see the blond, gorgeous woman behind the counter which I've fancied for some time. I say hello to her, she says hello back with her beautiful smile. I swipe my member's card, before turning to her with a serious look: 

""Listen, S[...], I need to ask you a question."" She is all ears. - ""Are you single?"" 

A big smile appear on her face. 

""I'm afraid I'm not."" I smile back at her. - ""Sorry, no. I'm not."" 

""I felt I had to simply ask you,"" I replied. She totally agreed, still with a big smile on her face. 

Then we switched over to a completely normal conversation with her being very helpful and I being completely cool and casual. I don't think the smile disappears from her face at all. She wishes me a good work-out, and I wish her a pleasant day, before I go and change. 

**Less than an hour later** I approach this young, stunning brunette with beautiful hazel eyes. I've noticed that she sent me some looks while I worked out. 

""Hi,"" I say with a smile. She turns to me, almost as if startled. 

""Oh, hi,"" she says. 

""Are you okay?"" I ask. 

""Yeah, I'm fine,"" she says. Her voice is tender, and she has a kind and quiet demeanor. 

""You were over at the treadmill, weren't you?"" I ask her. She says 'yes'. - ""Are you single?"" I feel my heart racing as I look into her eyes. She giggles: 

""No, I'm not."" 

""You kept looking at me from over there,"" I said with a smile. 

""Oh, I'm sorry!"" she exclaims in a most humble manner. She's actually blushing! 

""No, no, it's okay,"" I say with a soothing voice. - ""It's very nice that you have a boyfriend."" She smiles at me with her kind eyes. - ""Have a nice work-out."" 

""Thank you,"" she says, smiling. 

I leave her with a big grin on my face, walking like I don't have a care in the world. Four approaches in four days. Three approaches in one single afternoon. A skilled pick-up artist couldn't have done it better. Although I got three nos and one 'maybe', my chance would have been zero if I hadn't approached at all.

My friend threw up from excessive drink so I started rounding him and my other friend up to leave. As I was going to get my coat, there was a girl in my way so naturally I said ""Excuse me,"" and put my hand on her back to brush her aside. Her hair happened to be long, so I accidentally pawed a bit of her hair during my gesture. 

Wow. 

It just struck me. Her hair was so soft. It gnarled my fingers with gentle grasps like a newborn's innocent hands. I have not been dazed like that from one touch in a long time, or might have been never until then. 

The thought is proposed: arousal might not just be from seeing cleavage or a tight ass or just thinking of banging. Arousal has so much more depth to it then that. The intimacy of just getting to know another person's body goes so much farther outside of the usuals. 

Now, I'm looking at pictures of women online (not nude) and thinking: ""If I could see her naked, it won't have that same feeling of pleasant coolness that the presence and touch of a real women will give me."" I feel like when I get my next romantic relationship, I will experience it in a whole new light because of quitting.

Started yesterday, I see a beautiful lady working at the candy store. I grew some balls did my first cold approach ever. I went up to her and simply said, ""I find you very pretty, can I have your number?"" She smiled and said ""I have a boyfriend, sorry."" I didn't give a fuck she said that. The rush of doing my first cold approach, was riveting.

Fast forward to thursday night, I go out drinking. Scouting out a potential lady to get her number. No luck. Now it's the bars closing time, I'm chillin on the streets still looking at women go up and down. Finally, I see this woman I find very attractive. I just stand and check her out some more from afar. Finally, she is free from all the guys and it's just her and her friend. Adrenaline kicks in, I jog up, look at her and say, ""Hey white pants, your very attractive!"" and I start jogging away. She yells back to me ""Hey! You can't call me attractive and just leave, come back.""

Going to leave out some parts just because it's a little NSFW, but I really hit it off with her instantly. Instant connection. Ends up shes  taking me back to her place! CRAZY. Talk about all these emotions running through you in the course of one day. I was really nervous and  I didn't want to take advantage of her while she was REAL drunk. So, we just ended up cuddling and kissing all night! When she woke up she said she LOVED cuddling me :D. We went for a 3 hour walk today and we got to know each other more!

finish the 90 day challenge. Tomorrow?  I'm not 
sure, but i'll sure as hell be ready for it.",TheRainbowSheep,215,27,109,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/136hw2/two_days_ago_i_spoke_before_400_people_today_i/,"Hello everybody :)
 

Exactly 91 days ago, i discovered this community by accident and after reading some posts, i felt ashamed. Ashamed, but hopeful as well. My habits could change, **I could change!** And so i started off the day after. It hasn't been easy, with new temptations nearly every day, but i persisted. I couldn't and wouldn't let this part of me, that i wanted to say goodbye forever, get the best of me.
 

And so, after three months, i present to you my 90 days report. I haven't kept track of everything in an exact manner, but i'll try to tell you as much as possible.


**Day 1-3:** Hard as hell (no pun intended, but you sure can take it as if it were), full of temptation. I was going crazy, but i wouldn't let myself go, for i had a purpose, something to achieve, and i couldn't just give up after only a few days due to my pride and even a touch of vanity. Nobody would like to realize the position he is in after giving in to an addiction, so i went on.


**Day 4-15:** I felt increasing confidence as i went on and started to get used to the temptations everywhere. I'm not saying i wasn't tempted, just that i was less easily. My emotions were pretty much the same as the used to be, but i noticed a larger urge to go out and meet people, so when a friend flaked on me for 2 days of a 4 day festival, i decided to just go anyways and have fun. I had a blast and was more convinced than ever that this was the way to go.


**Day 16-30:** my confidence kept building up and around the 25 day mark, i felt amazing. When the new school year started, i decided not to be the guy i used to be anymore. No, i wouldn't ditch my values or stop being a good student. However, i would become more outgoing, less boring and generally a bigger value to peoples lives. As i started off the year with this attitude, i noticed how i had switched sides and now belonged to the part of society that had fun, even during regular days. Other people, being as i was before, now were visible (or rather their lack of visibility was) and i figured, again, that this was who i wanted to become: a person that goes out and is noticed, but without the cliché traits, such as no 'real' friends, etc. I also figured out that cold showers would give me energy and determination for the rest of the day. Daily pushups boosted my confidence as well.


**Day 31-40:** I went for it, but my ex didn't really like my newfound attention (female attention, fyi), and it got the better of me when she started gossiping about me and generally ruining people's opinion about me. I still see this period as the reason i'm still single today, as before i could fix the damage she had done, it was already to late with the girl i had been talking to a lot before... Anyways, i talked a lot with my friends and decided just to let her live her rotten life. She had turned against me when i broke up with her, even if i was perfectly gentle (like, for real) and she had treated me badly for weeks (well, mostly flaking on me, ignoring me and not having time for me whenever she wanted). I did however did discover the flourishing gossips that had turned into existence because of how she had behaved, and with some sadistic pleasure (it isn't beneath anyone amongst us, and you all know it), i noted how people had adopted a new view of both of us, favoring me and rendering a lot of those gossips harmless. So after this little crisis, in which i felt terrible, but didn't give in to the temptation (it got quite pushed to the background due to everything else, which was one positive side), and so i moved on...


**Day 41-65:** Difficult time: while i was much improved over my previous self, temptations still struck me at the most horrible of timings and the line got very thin for me. I, however, decided every time not to give in or even edge, and except one wet dream, which became lucid right when it was too late and gave me a horrible feeling afterwards, i stayed clean. I also had some awesome days, of course, but there were too many ups and downs for me to truly be able to say that it was a very enjoyable time.


**Day 65-85:** Getting it together again. Trouble was behind me, temptations seemed easier to resist and i didn't flatline either (as i had some times before). I also signed up for an international project and prepared for it together with some new people i met. I got off with those folks quite well and time flew. My grades at school kept constant and high as well, with less lower points than before. A rather dull holiday was included in this period as well, being full of work for school, but the few times i got together with people were absolutely fantastic and saved my mood more than once when i was studying. I kept building myself up part by part, becoming more of the person i wanted to be every single time. I also signed up for a presentation during the project, as the only volunteer of our group.


**Day 86-87:** I was flying high once more. My confidence was as high as it had been before, weekend was coming and i just felt good, because i didn't have a single reason not to. The only dark cloud in the skies was my excess of school work, but i tackled it with great determination and managed to finish it all before it was time to leave for our international meeting.


**Day 88-90:** After a long trip, we finally arrived in the city where the debate would go on. We had a fun night in the city with the entire group and played poker until 2 am (although nobody knew the rules :P), just having a good time. The day after, we gathered with the other participating groups of the event, and i did something i couldn't have before i took the challenge: i did a presentation in front of hundreds of people, without anyone doing it before me to ease my nerves. I stressed until right before the time, but i nailed it. I freaking did it and i'm proud to say it. Video's, pictures and reactions showed me that i had done as well as i could barely imagine and i felt something. That incredible feeling when you have pushed your boundaries so far that it could've left you shivering in misery, but instead raised you higher than ever. That feeling when you have conquered a fear, or at least dealt it a terrible blow, and you KNOW that you will never be the same again. I got that feeling, and my confidence went through the roof, hopefully never to come back down. 

The rest of the day was a fantastic time: my remarks changed the debates drastically, i met tons of new people (including plenty of girls that would've ignored me in a previous life, but were know nearly literally waiting for the person talking to me to finish, so they could) and managed to be a value to peoples days (as i had always wanted, and not done on such a scale before). I believe this day changed me fundamentally, but wouldn't have been possible before this challenge, and today, on day ninety, i speak to you as a proud man (well, not sure if a 17 year old counts as a man for you, but i'll take my chance), not just proud of what i have done, but also of who i am and most importantly: of who i will become.


So to those who still doubt the challenge: Fucking take it already! It's not a miracle road to greatness, but it clears that very single road pretty freaking well. Yes, there will always be things you doubt in yourself or you wish to improve, but this, right here, is solid gold and it's there just for you, so let go of fapping and take it with both hands, never to let go of it ever again. You might not make it the first try, but it doesn't matter. This challenge is not about the end point, it's about the way to it, and the harder it is, the more it will raise you above your previous self.


Peace out

I have been a long lurker and in serious denial of my problem with PMO. Tomorrow is my birthday, I will be 32, and I have not been in a serious relationship since my Fiancé walked out on me several years ago. Now I see it is due to my addiction. I was broken and living in a very nasty cycle of PMO and drinking that seemed to go hand in hand. Fapping lead to my complete lack of confidence and other issues with women. I would then drink to regain my ""confidence"", and would then utterly destroy any chance I may have had with the woman I was talking to. The cycle would start over, and continued for the next 18 years. I am a nice guy (I get friend zoned a lot) and have been told this many times. Yet every time my relationships failed and I would end up single again, I would just blame the women, never me. 

I recently met a girl that I am nuts about. We have a ton in common and more similar interests that anyone I have known over the past 18 years, hell my entire life. We have been going back and forth for a bit, but have not committed to a serious relationship. I have noticed that my issues such as confidence, picking up on subtle clues while talking and the like are coming back. I now see that fapping is the issue and my addiction to PMO is to blame. 

I want things to work with this girl more than anything. So yesterday I completely gave up everything I had with that part of my life. I destroyed several hard drives (about 2 TB worth) of pictures and videos. I thew out several (yes I had a few) ""female analogs"" I had. I also stopped drinking! I am dead serious about making things work with her, but I cannot love someone else if I do not love myself! I have to fixe me.

The past 12 hours have been unbelievably hard. I had no idea just how much and often I would find comfort in porn, even in only 12 hours! Last night was the first time I cried in over 20 years. I had a million thought running through my mind as I tried to sleep. When I finally go to the point where I would just fap to forget and sleep, I didn't… And I could not be happier!

Night one, in the books

**TL;DR - If you read all that, You are the type of person I should be talking to about this. Thank you :)**

**UPDATE: 8:30pm CST** Wow this got a lot of attention here, thank you all for the kind words of support. It has made the day easier.

I had no idea how hard this would be or just how deep my problem went. I know I am on day one and many of you are much further along, but I am confident I will make 24 full hours, then a 48, and so on!

The hardest part so far is these random thoughts flowing through my brain. They have upset me so much so that people at work took notice. I know it's my brain trying to get me to run back to porn. Praying on my weakness, my complete lack of self confidence. I am starting to feel embarrassed about all this, I feel very broken. 

But spending the day reading all the positives that come from this are keeping me going! I will report back tomorrow and hopefully with success.

I beleive the recurring theme of becoming more confident has to do with the excess sexual energy spilling into the lower three chakras, which are all to do with willpower and assertiveness. 

NoFap is the single more important thing you can be doing if you're no good with women. It turns you from a puppydog into a wolf.

What was sold to us is a house in the country with lots of space and fresh air, free from all the dirtiness of the city.  Free from crowds, panhandlers, grifters, filthy streets, smog, traffic, violence, inequality.  A place where we could work on the old Mustang and let our dog and our kids run free in the yard.  A retirement that would provide for us as in old age so long as we'd been faithfully saving.

Instead, we got spec houses and cheap McMansions in sprawling car-dependent neighborhoods near to nothing.  We got porches too small to even sit on.  We got underfunded school systems rife with ADHD, anxiety and depression.  We got processed foods and fast foods and too much sugar and too little exercise.  We got reconstituted patties shaped like the part of the animal we forgot we were eating.  Our retirements were invested here as well, and we lost our shirts when the markets saw suburbia for what it is, an imitation of something real.

What we forgot was that everything worth having is the result of hard work.

In the same way, porn was sold to us like the American dream.  What we bought was an easy way out.  We wanted satisfaction and porn was easy.  Easier than talking to a girl, a girl who is way out of your league (and frankly, aren't they all?) who might blow you off on a whim or who might have a boyfriend who is bigger than you.  A girl who might, for what ever reason, break your heart.  A girl who if she is worth anything will make you wait a goddamned second or two because she knows it will be better for the waiting.

Instead, we got instantaneous satisfaction.  We got sedation, and placation and something that felt like something real -- a thing we once knew or something we'd only imagined.  It was at once bigger and better than our wildest dreams could conceive, and at the same time less meaningful and less thrilling than just a word whispered into our ear, from the lips of a good woman.  Still, we bought it and we got off.  And after a while things started happening.  Suddenly, it wasn't as good or it wasn't enough.  And we used more.  Before we knew it we were letting our wives or girlfriends writhe in the bed next to us because of PE or ED or because we were gaming or watching TV to distract us from what was happening.  We let them forget what real intimacy felt like and, in turn, we began to forget ourselves.  Our work suffered, our families suffered, our minds suffered. We began to throw around blame.  At last, we were emasculated.

Again, we'd forgotten that everything worth having is the result of hard work.

The good news is that others still remember.  And in the dark recesses inside us -- the place where we often fear to look in for what we might find -- so do we.  We know that the feeling of collapsing in exhaustion at the end of a workout is more satisfying than any drug.  We know what it feels like to really go after it at work and reap the rewards of a job well done.  We know that investing in our educations is more valuable than any car we might drive.  We know that charity and sustainability can make us richer than any material excess.  We know that a good book is far better than television.  We know that porn will never mean as much as looking others unflinchingly in the eye.

And even the most porn-addicted among us knows or at least hopes to whatever god may be that when he dies he will take with him the memory of satisfying a woman, [of holding her as she cries out in utter ecstasy, unable to draw breath.](/nsfw) Of just lying beside her.  Running his fingers through her hair.

That, gentlemen, is what NoFap is about for me.

I just wanted to tell you guys how happy I am I started NoFap. I'm ony on day 5, but I feel like a totally different person. I've never felt so manly and social. Was out partying last night and talked to so many people, I couldn't believe it. I was talking with people in the queue, joking around with the bouncers, talking to many many lovely ladies! The party ended at 3, (which is a bit early for me personally), but I hung out with two lovely ladies 'til the early hours. of course the alcohol helped, but I think NoFap has a lot to do with the way I was behaving.

I feel more confident and manly when I walk the streets or go to the supermarket. Normally at the supermarket I would often get very nervous at the check out, especially when a beautiful lady was working it. Now everything goes so smoothly and they seem to smile at me more.

It's a real eye opener to experience that it is truely all about confidence. I had to fight some cravings in the past 4 days, but I already can't imagine how bad I would feel after relapsing.

I'm not trying to sound cocky, I just wanted to share this awesome feeling with the fellow fapstronauts. Also I have a feeling 
that when I share this kind of stuff, the urge to relapse will be reduced. 

I'm very curious what the future holds for me!

Seriously, I'm sort of in shock about the night I just had.  There was this gorgeous girl at a party, who I had met before, who I deferred to another fellow because I knew I wasn't particularly interested in dating her, and thought he might be.  I had to watch this guy do what I thought wasn't an amazing job of showing her a good time for the evening, but I didn't even mind.  I thought to myself that there would be a good book (a little Arthur C. Clarke, if you're into that) waiting for me at the end of the night regardless.

Apparently this sort of behavior turns you into a complete stud, as she seemed to still be quite into me, even as I continued to defer.  Then at the dance club we all took the ladies out to for the evening, this other hot girl starts all dancing up on me, and long-story-short I dance with her for the better part of the night, with make-out sessions completely initiated by her (my first ever, really).  Strangest thing.  A 5 mile run and a cold shower at 4 in the morning is all I could have done to keep this streak going.

I don't know if this is the sort of thing I want to become a habit... I doubt it is, but strangely I don't feel horribly guilty about it.  It was enjoyable while it lasted, and I feel no horrible need sans reasonability to call her up over the weekend.  Chalk that up as a few sentences I never thought I could write.

Power on, folks.

That's not to say just don't fap and women will come in their droves. I have been out a lot and have built up my confidence, it takes time.

Anyway, I am a British guy interning in New York and had a day off to explore. Approaching women in the day scared the shit out of me, in fact, I have never done it before. I saw a stunning blonde girl walking on her own in central park. Everything in my head was telling me to walk away but another part of me knew I had to at least try. I approached her, everything started great and we walked around the park together.Turns out shes Russian and here for one day so I take her to the nicer parts of Manhatten. Anyway, we end up kissing, having a great day etc.. 

I probably wont see her again but the fact that I did it still astounds me.  I believe Nofap might give you that push to do things you won't normally do. I have no option now but to talk to girls if I want any kind of release. going home and fapping is not an option.

UPDATE

A lot of comments said that it was easy for me because of my accent. I have to say during my time during NYC, my accent has proved to big issue. Many girls think my accent is fake because a lot of American apparently put it on. A lot of my interaction with women was spent with them questioning if my accent was real which made it a tad harder.",,False,,t5_2skrn,1344479186.0,,month6,True,t3_xvw6r,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/xvw6r/met_a_girl_in_central_park/,

This post is just to mark my completing 120 days of No Porn, No Fantasy, and No Fap.

The 4th month wasn't difficult at all. No struggles with temptations. I just remained constantly vigilant of factors that make me horny and refused to edge at all. I took care of the minutes (so to speak) and the months took care of themselves.

No difference in my attitude since day 90. The same sense of quiet resolve and optimism pervades my attitude that didn't exist before, although my personal life continues to be extraordinarily shitty.

Next post on ~~180~~ 150 days. Good luck to you all on your nofap journey.

Cheers!

First time I went home with her was 2 months before starting on NoFap. My dick didn't make a single move when we undressed and grinded, I didn't get hard *at all*. I've known ED and DE since I was 19, but it had become a serious issue during the past 12 months - total impotence with women, even while watching porn getting and staying hard required more and more effort.

So I took the blue pill a couple of times with the GF, it worked for ED, but there was no way I could O, even the wildest fantasies didn't help.

Last weekend (4th Week on NoFap) I didn't take any helpers. I simply didn't want to, it's not healty and taking Via9ra is depressing somehow. But for the first time with her I had a good natural erection, solid on and off for about an hour, and I was much more aroused by her naked body. Still, I couldn't O.

This time, on my 35th day, the magic did happen: kissing and touching the woman turned me on like never before, I was rock hard, and stayed hard even with a condom on. Now here's the thing: I could have orgasmed at any time, and I finally did, uncontrollable, intense like hell, no fantasies and no extra stimulation needed - with a condom! I can't even remember when this happened the last time, O with rubber between me and the girl.

I'm so grateful, fellow fapstronauts. It must have been at least 10 times where I'd have relapsed without you.

Dem dere yoga pants........ hhhhnnnngggggg




Keep at it fapstronauts, We're becoming superior sexual beings in comparison to the overwhelming majority through practicing no fap, distinguishing ourselves through abstinence of porn consumption and self-induced pleasure, and hopefully some of you out there are meditating. 



For those of you flat-lining right now, fu#$ depression in the mouth, grab your balls and scream. Start every day like you're gonna go into battle. Every girl you walk past, imagine her pleasuring herself to the thought of you, now smile as you think about that. That's how you should smile as that girl passes you on the street, as you're talking to her, in class, in the gym, wherever you are encountering women. Whether your libido is sky-high or you've temporarily lost interest in the most beautiful women, remember one thing, you CAN.



WE ARE THE KNIGHTS OF NO FAP, LET'S DO THIS. From the guy in Australia, to the guy in New York, to the man in Istanbul, each and every one of you has immeasurable power over your own lives, the people you associate yourself with, and the choices you make.

I was done. If I smoked then I was tempted to overeat and play games, If i play game I was tempted to fap or smoke, if I fapped I got lazy and would fall back into gaming and smoking. All the addiction fed off each other so I needed to quit them all.

My mind was fucked up from the cycle. I was out of touch of reality. I no longer had any hope or faith in anything in my life. All I wanted was pleasure. I was lonely. Isolated. Angry. Sad. Only time I was happy was when I was caving in, overstimulated with what ever came up on my monitor.

At first it wasn't too bad. I hit the gym every other day, followed a very good diet, stayed busy. I noticed as I smoke less my desire to escape into virtual pc game world lessened too. The porn was hard to get off from at first, but I wanted to use it as a practice hoping the discipline would translate to other areas of my life. Also wanted more mental clarity, and less bitch-ass-ness that comes from low testosterone and low sex drive.

I didn't focus on meditating or reading books and shit like I did before. I didn't go to marijuana anonymous meetings because all they talk about is how great the meetings are but never really get into any real juicy issues. Wanted to just spend the first 2 or 3 weeks detoxing before getting into rebuilding my mind.

Things were getting better. Covered shifts at work. Got an internship. Started dropping fat from diet and exercise. Then I met a girl. We had a lot of wild sex. Too much. She was a negative girl and it rubbed off on me. My mind was vulnerable without its usual fillers and was sensitive to any new incoming information.


I noticed even after we had sex, my mind was still trying to find a way to keep the high going. I started craving weed. I smoked once to bond with the girls friends, but I told myself no more for at least 2 months because I had immediately desired more the next day. 

When I went home my mind was still looking for a chaser, and it found one: Anger. Things got really violent with me and my Mom and I got kicked out of my house. I don't have any family besides her so I stayed at this chicks house, but she didn't know me to understand what I was going through, so I bounced and now I've been sleeping in my car the last 2 nights.

Halloween weekend, 24 years old, young, handsome, smart, passionate, yet somehow I managed to spend every holiday alone this year. It really got me down. I was skating down venice beach just wishing someone would bump into me so I could beat the shit out of them. I tried meditating but just ended up cursing at God and knocking down signs and trashcans. 

Grew up an only child with no family, so I have a habit on sitting alone feeling sorry for myself that's hard to break. Depression is my baseline emotion. I'm very up and down, Some say I'm bipolar, others say I'm an asshole, but it's hard for me to be in between. PEople love going to parties with me but never stick around on regular days when I just want a friend to hang out with. 

I know the weed made it worse. It was clouding my dreams, giving me suicidal thoughts, childhood flashback, inferiority complexes. Started having more and more violent fantasies.


Sober on my 18th day ( I smoke once but fuck it ill say 17th, I'm not gonna start over just because of 2 puffs) under a full los angeles moon I feel horrible. I pulled up some porn to get a quick good feeling in, but I commited to my effort and closed the porn and put my dick away.  I also broke my cell phone in rage, so for the last 4 nights I've been without a home or any kind of communication with people besides email.

Suicidal thoughts are reigning my mind tonight. If things don't get better in a year from now I'm killing myself. Whatever it is that people need in order to live happily, well, I'll be convinced I don't have it. I hate that the holidays are coming up, I'd rather be out causing mayhem than spending another thanksgiving or new years crying in my room.

Until then I guess it's time to get into some recovery. Get a sponsor for my weed problem. Try to understand what my mind is going through without having porn or gaming to escape into. Try to accept the lost years of my life, lost opportunities, and dreams I threw in the gutter. My whole life was built around these addictions, and without them, I don't know what to do with my life. I'm scared, and I'm lazy.

I really just want to feel good. Just close my eyes a disappear from the world. I don't have much hope for anything. Maybe my bipolar has me swinging really low again. I'm tired of the mood extremes.  Going to yoga tomorrow morning, hopefully I get an epiphany or that the universe flows love into my life, it's the only thing that slows down my anger---&gt; my rage addictions being the final frontier. I learned this last few weeks I have no business trying to date any chicks, nothing more than hookups if I can even get that. 

Just going through a really hard time with all this right now, on top of not having a place to stay, finding out I got kicked out of my college and cant reapply til fall 2013, and seeing the white girl who only worked at my job 3 months get promoted where I've been working 1.5+ years.

A couple months ago, I went on a 2nd date with a girl from OKcupid. Originally we planned to go snowtubing but the snow had melt. Instead she invites me over for dinner. I get there, it's just us and it’s going really good. But then, her roommate and his mom shows up. We all hang out and play board games. Now her roommate’s mom is really hot, (and since I was 21 days nofap) I decide to playfully flirt with the mom. The mom is totally into it. It gets late though, and she eventually leaves. It's only me, my date and her roommate left. I suppose her roommate didn't enjoyed me flirting with his mom because I was cock-blocked the rest of the night. 
    

At about 12:30am, we're all very tired and the roommate asks if i'm going to spend the night, (*awkward*). So, they set me up in the ""Guest Loft"" which is an alcove/cubby about 6 feet off the ground right next to this girls room. I'm so exhausted that I just crash instead of waiting up for her to finish brushing her teeth (I should have waited). I’m asleep in this guest loft, right next to this girl's room and I start having crazy sexual dreams. One of the dreams is so intensely sexual that I wake up right away realizing something bad. I look down and see that I justed blasted about 21 days worth of jizz into my underwear (wet dream).
    

I think “holy fuck this is bad - You can't get invited to a girls house and then jizz all over her guest room bed.” I'm freaking out, perhaps I should just run out to my car, leave and never return. I don't know what else to do. So I decide that is my plan. It’s really cold outside and I remember that my sweatshirt is on the floor next to the bed. So i lean over the bed head-first to grab my sweatshirt... except, i totally forgot that I’m in a loft. I end up diving head first down a 6 foot drop.
    

At the last moment, I catch myself on a panel of wood and cabinet. Unfortunately I break both of them, cracking the wall and causing a giant banging sound. Now i'm fucked, I just jizzed all over the place broke her cabinet and the wall, everyone must have heard it! So i run to the bathroom in my sticky underwear while carrying my jeans. Finally some good luck. It’s looks as if all the jizz stayed in my underwear. But now I have to figure out what to do with a destroyed pair of underwear. Do I try to hide it somewhere? Where? They must have heard the crash. They are probably right outside looking to see what happened. I quickly ball up the underwear and shove it down my pants. I go back to the bed and no one is there?!. I look around for jizz evidence. I can't find any, but its dark (i'm like 90% sure that it all stayed in my underwear!) Now my only concern is the smell. I mean, c'mon it's 21 days’ worth of cum. And, she's sleeping, at most,  15 ft away in her room.
    

Anyways, I start to get tired, think *screw it* (she lived 45 min away, it's not like it was a coworker and I would be permanent known as the creep who masturbates all over your guest room while you sleep). So I laydown and fall back asleep. I wake up to sounds of the girl moving around the house. She goes downstairs, so I have quickly make the bed while looking for any cum stains (I didn't see any!). I put all my clothes on while she comes back up the stairs. She jokes about how I'm trying to break her house into pieces. All of a sudden, in slowmotion, i see her nostrils flair. She is starting to smell the jizz! I quickly make some excuse about having to grab some mouthwash from my car. I run out to the and secretly pull the underwear out of my pants and stash it. Now, I made it thus far. I decide to push my luck,  I come back into the house and we hang out for like 2 hours, nothing awkward at all. 

I spent all the next day waiting for a text message: ""Did you cum all over the guest loft?""

Anyway, I'm back on the nofap bandwagon.

**tl;dr** 21 days nofap, I go on my first date in over a year. I spend the night and paint the guest room.

I've seen a decent number of responses to other people posting milestones asking why they started NoFap so I figure I'll just give a little insight off the bat.

I started about 2 months after breaking up with my last girlfriend. While dating her I still watched plenty of porn and masturbated probably 3-5 times a week which isn't that much compared to some, but was enough for me to cause some issues with getting aroused when we were having sex. It caused some pretty big fights between us and what-not but I never stopped while still with her. Finally I figured it would be good for me to just quit, so I started. After getting through the first milestones like a week, then 30 days, and so on, I was much easier to get aroused and was much more interested in doing physical activity and such. Since starting, I've been lifting weights regularly and been participating in sports through my school. It was kind of just replacing one thing with a healthier thing and I haven't looked back since. It was made easier the first month or two that I started because I was still having sex from time to time and it got me over that hump of wanting to go back to fapping just for release.

All in all, I've got zero regrets about doing it and it's made my life more enjoyable. More than anything the biggest change I see is that I'm interested in/attracted to so many more girls when out at the bars or wherever than I used to be. It's made me have stronger urges to approach girls and such, and while it doesn't always work out it's nice to just do it.

Feel free to ask any questions you have of me too, but just keep it up guys/girls, feels great to hit that 1 year mark and be able to tell my friends (some of which participate as well to some extent in NoFap) that I'm at 6 months, then 9, then 1 year.

Other times I'm on the offense. A cold shower when I want a hot shower. A salad when I want fries. A run when I want a nap. I'm training myself to say No to myself. Each No makes me stronger to resist the next attack. I'm getting pleasure from being in charge. 

The intensity of the attacks are getting stronger. I thought they'd be getting less. But, I take this to mean that my opponent sees just who it is he's messing with. He used to be able to show up at this fight and meet no resistance. Now, he's throwing one armored division after another at me. His opponent is no longer some fucking wimp.

21 year old, white virgin-man here.

This is easily my strongest run on NoFap so far. I stumbled upon this community in January of 2012, after finding myself bored with porn - a state that I’d never have *dreamed* of finding myself in. From then until March of 2012, I eked out 50 days of no-porn, no-fappin. In those 50 days, I added 5 lbs. of muscle (onto my sparse 120 frame), carved out my six-pack, and emerged from my self-made prison of introversion. The first two weeks felt like I was *living* for the first time, noticing things like a beautiful sunrise and discovering the ambition to pull off monstrous deadlines with the fluid ease of a trapeze artist. With a six-pack. 

I made a decision to go back to porn in mid-March of 2012 - not under the impression that I was “cured,” but due to simple weakness. In the days before this critical relapse, I simply had enough of this community at the time. I quit NoFap at a time when a movement called “The next time I cum it will be inside of a woman,” was sweeping this subreddit - a mentality that I have a huge problem with, and one that was populated by self-entitled children. So I took the easy way out. Instead of standing up for my beliefs (on the internet liek a reel man), I quit coming to NoFap. Without the safety net of this site, it was a matter of weeks before I relapsed at day 50 in 2012.

This prompted several months of PMO *immersion* - this time with the added fact that I knew I was better than the activity I was engaging in. **Far better.** I built up small streaks after this long period of self-flagellating, none lasting more than 3 weeks. I placed the old chains of social anxiety and intense introversion back upon myself, till I grew more unstable than before.

Until December 23rd, 2012. 

*That’s when I quit bitching to myself that NoFap is hard, and decided that I wanted to see myself make some lasting changes to my life.*

I must say, to go three months into the year without masturbating makes me feel like a damn champ. And now, I find myself at day 96, still exercising, eating better than ever, and having the stones to make some real social connections and improvements. I won’t lie to y’all chillins. It’s been *tough.* Every day past 90 that I venture towards, I find myself having to suppress enormous urges that grow daily.

Last night was no exception to this recent trend. I went to sleep ridiculously hard, and woke up at 6 this morning in the midst of a wet-dream. A dream about *porn* and the detached, unrealistic people that inhabit it. A dream about a woman wi... well, maybe this isn’t the right place for that much detail. I’m quite familiar with NoFap’s rules about jizzin’ while unconscious, but goddamn. I can understand why a confused Fapstronaut or two would like to know if something that drains you so completely could warrant a reset.

I kinda felt like garbage as I loaded my sheets into the washer today. But I refuse to let this habit define who I am and who I will become. I chewed through the leash of PMO with my own goddamn teeth months ago, and now I roam the unexplored wilderness of the sweet, untasted future with my freed brothers and sisters. I will not taste defeat in this challenge again. If you’ve truly struggled with porn, then NoFap is a fucking *lifestyle* y’all, not some magic fucking bullet you shoot at your dick in the hopes of it suddenly attracting the poonanies. Improve yourself first, son. Go hard or go home.

Practicing self-control brings you more pleasure than masturbating will ever give you. This much I can say with confidence.

Thanks, NoFap.

[It was with the Aneros, but without viewing porn.] (/nsfw)  Over the last 2 weeks or so I'd been sneaking peeks at light solo nudes of a couple of models I used to like.  

Ever since I became sexually active again a couple of months ago, the urges have been very hard to overcome.  The sexual activity waned for interpersonal reasons with my last partner, which left me a lot of intense cravings.  Feelings of loneliness led to me caving in this time.

But not all is lost.  I still learned a great deal about myself and have made a huge improvement from how I used to be.  I threw out the toy and reset my counter.  My personal goal for this challenge was not to gain as many days as possible per se, but to gain control over feelings of need for sexual release, sexual activity with a partner, and even just affectionate gestures in general.  In general I am past the point of actually being interested in looking at porn.  Even though I looked at a couple of different models that I used to, the hardcore stuff I used to watch does not appeal to me in any way.  I think this is because I look at humans very differently now, which is a beautiful thing in itself.

I taught myself how to transfer the anxious energy and tension from a craving into something productive, for me this is music production.  As long as I'm concentrating on a personal goal and working hard, I feel that everything else in life aligns.

I am disappointed in myself to an extent.  But I'm not going to sit and wallow, and for sure I'm not looking for sympathy.  I greatly appreciate this sub and everyone who takes part in it.  So I leave you with this...an idea regarding attraction to others that I wrote and saved in the notepad of my phone a few months ago:

""Purpose is a beam of light.  If you align it to yourself, to only your goals and aspirations (pointed upwards), people will see its brightness.  They will be attracted to it, see its power and wonder what it is pointing at.  If your beam has no aim and is pointing  a places other than yourself, and at other people, they will be scared of its direct power.  They will be driven away because the attention will be too much for them.  Keep your beam upwards and constant.  When someone comes along close enough and wants to feel the power, break them off some with enthusiasm and passion...then get the fuck back to what you were doing.""

I'll let badgebot be in charge of the math. (21 days)

Hello all. This is my very first time posting anything on reddit. I will try my best keep it short and sweet for you guys.

I am a 25 year old female. I am on day 21 without PM and day 10 without O. 

I discovered porn and masturbation at age 18. I was not sexually active during high school. I was very overweight and had no self-esteem. It wasn’t until college that I started to explore. I masturbated a lot through-out the 4 years I spent at school. I even gain more weight. I had one sexual encounter but being a virgin I chickened out. 

College ended and I tried to continue living on my own with my college friends as roommates. I had a thing for one of my best guy friend (who was also my roommate) who only had eyes for my best friend. I was hurt when he asked me to set them up but I did it (they’re getting married soon.) I guess I suddenly became a threat because they started hating me and eventually I had to leave my own place and move back home.

I was so depressed by the whole thing. Here I was, fat, friendless, reliant on alcohol and video games for fun, extremely low self esteem and to top it all off I was living with my parents. I’ll skip over the small details but it took 2 years of hard work on myself to get to where I am now. 

So far I have lost 80lbs, have great friends, only use alcohol and video games in social settings. My self esteem has sky rocketed. I now rock climb, participate in a martial art, run daily and go out dancing. Yeah that’s right. I fucking dance. 

However I was still PMO’ing. My discovery of PMO was simultaneous. Since then I had always found it much easier to O to Porn than to use my imagination. It just took too long to use my imagination. And as with everyone with an addiction to porn it started off with the soft core stuff and worked its way to the more extreme. I’m no different in that aspect.

I was a 3 or 4 times a week kind of girl but I still felt like that was too much. I also would have the same ""what the fuck am I watching"" moment after each O and would feel somewhat disgusted with myself. I would feel even worse if it wasn't a good O. I would immediately think, ""that was it? what was the point of all that effort and time I just wasted?""

My job required me to work nights so I was using PMO less for pleasure and more as a way to get to sleep during the day. Looking back I really forced the O way too much. 

I decided that it was time to try out dating. I did a reflection of myself and saw that I was a perfectly normal girl in her 20’s. I was secure about my body and myself. I could handle tough situations calmly without getting stressed out. I was fun and energetic and enjoyed new things. I like to think I wasn’t bad looking now that I had shucked an extra person off my being.

I started dating someone and we lost our virginities together. The sex was great for the first few weeks. Hey, it was brand spanking new to us. He always had a hard time reaching O without his own hand and something in the back of my head was bugging me.

We struggled with sex off and on and I was spending a lot of time focusing on his pleasure and not getting too much in return. It never bothered me too much because I could just take care of myself with porn. (He also admitted to watching porn. It didn’t bother me at all)

I noticed that I was starting to gain some weight back. I was suddenly binge eating again. I had stopped running. I wasn’t happy but I wasn’t sad either. The relationship was comfortable but not intoxicating. He was falling in love and I just felt “meh” about the whole thing.

One day I was trying to find a solution to his orgasm problem and stumbled upon No Fap Challenge and YourBrainOnPorn. I must have spent the next 3 hours reading forums and stories about this. I had an AH-HA moment and realized that our problem was that we were too used to our own hands and were desensitized from the porn.

We challenged each other to this no fap challenge but continued to have sex. The sex was better but he still couldn’t reach O without his own hand. Me on the other hand, I was suddenly way more sensitive and it didn’t take as long for me to reach O with his help. I realized that it felt way better anyway when he helped me out then it did when I helped myself out. But rarely did I get any help. Often he would get his O then either fall asleep or get up and play video games.

I tried several times to talk about it but just got ignored. I would hold back on sex but then he would never initiate it. I would give him extra attention hoping he would feel guilty enough to reciprocate. Never worked. I became very frustrated and all I got in return was a sheepish apology and no action toward fixing it.

I started to see my partner with new eyes. He had suddenly become a lazy, selfish man-child. I suddenly could not stand his pigsty of an apartment. I couldn’t stand the unsanitary state of his bathroom or even the way he dressed. Everything about him was starting to piss me off.

I was starting to get very aggressive in bed but he would always try to calm me down with some cuddling. I didn’t want to fucking cuddle anymore. I had spent the last 4 months cuddling. I wanted out.

And this is where I have to thank you guys. Without sticking with the NoFap challenge I would have never had the metaphorical balls to stand up for what I wanted and deserved in that relationship. I could have easily stayed in that relationship and kept schlicking away the resentment I had toward my partner. I owe this forum a lot. 

I’m on day 21 now and over those 21 days I have experienced just about everything everyone else has been experiencing. Except for the raging boners of course. Ha. I’ve experienced unbelievable urges, periods of flat lining, better sleep, more ambition, slight depression, unexplainable feelings of warmth and happiness. I’m starting to lose weight again and I’ve gotten back into running. I have all this free time now and the desire to fill it with awesome things. I feel amazing right now. I have been keeping a journal of my nofap journey and I plan to stick with it.

Thank you guys for keeping this forum so active. Your posts have kept me going strong. I felt I owed you my story and hopefully this helps some other woman out there who is lurking among the sea of men in this forum, trying to find some answers.

So I think we should evaluate our internet usage and try to cut down wherever possible if we want to maximize Nofap benefits.

- Confidence and calmness grows every day. It's not fearlessness but a lack of anxiety. People respond to it. I feel less compromised and more myself than ever.

- Time for others and insight into what makes them tick. I've always loved being with people but fap and porn often put up a barrier in understanding, made me impatient or unkind - total turnaround.

- Determination and productivity. Things are getting done that have taken me ages to tackle (years in some cases).

- Better appearance and physically stronger. Many comments on how good I look (especially my skin). Lost weight and take diet and exercise seriously.

- Emotions returning to life. This can be painful and sometimes they are out of proportion but I feel alive. Someone on this subreddit wrote success is partly about living with discomfort - I'm beginning understand that. The alternative is to deaden an emotion (or never to realise you even have an emotion) with a five hour wankfest?

- Feel better about myself and my life. My mum said yesterday that she thought I seemed happier than I had in a long time. I normally tell her most things but this one will remain my little secret.

- Enjoy feeling horny. If I see / meet someone I like I don't immediately feel desperate, inadequate and sad. I enjoy them and, if the situation allows, enjoy flirting with them in a relaxed, inventive way. People like that and respond. Even walking down the street is an erotic adventure at the moment.

To see real results, is to quit the internet entirely, or maybe limit it to 1-2 hours per day. 
Go out whenever possible, start living the life, hit on girls, do stupid things , make new friends whatever! As long as you are not at home on your computer chair. You will see results for sure.

**But the largest example of hyper-reality by far is pornography**. it's sexuality, one of life's most intimate and sensory encompassing actions, being infinitely reduced to a virtual experience devoid of any sense beyond sight and sound. in pornography, you are not having sex with a partner or porn star, and you are not having sex with yourself; you are running a socially-conditioned simulation of an ideal of sex, a knowingly unobtainable object of desire that you virtually become attached to until you are satisfied, after which you are sucked back into the ""unsatisfactory"" reality of being naked in a room, alone.

1340115418.0,177,self.NoFap,v9yrb,I went to the bar after 13 days of nofap. This is what happened.,,224,47,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/v9yrb/i_went_to_the_bar_after_13_days_of_nofap_this_is/,"I showed up with my buddies at the bar. Within 2 minutes of stepping inside I see a hot latina girl. I think I made fun of her or something. Usually I'll go into interview mode and ask questions like 'so where you from', 'so what do you do', 'so yeah the weather eh'

...'so when am I gonna man up and stop being a pussy'

But this time, yeah, I made fun of her. Not in a mean way, just in a flirty way. Busting her balls, and then balancing it out with 'where you from' questions. I felt more in touch with my masculine side. I felt comfortable doing what I wanted.

I realized that, she's just a woman. That's it. As I am just a guy. 

She took me back to her car, we drank a bit, then went back to the bar. She then had to go cause she was bar hopping, but I didn't go with her cause it was still early. Two seconds later, a woman approaches me and goes..

""Can I take you home with my friend and tie you up?""

My friends were like :O. Let me mention although I do workout and am a good looking dude, I NEVER get approached. I fully believe that higher testosterone levels / not fapping affected my behavior, body language and eye contact, thus making her come over to me.

I immediately was like ""fuck yes you can, as long as I can blindfold you though"" with a cheeky smile.

I chilled with her and her friend for a bit, then we went back to her place. I don't remember much because I was really drunk and I took a hit from the bong. I just remember me sleeping in a bed, waking up with a girl on each side of me, and her extremely socially awkward brother standing in the doorway. I don't think I had sex, but whatever. Fun times.

I left that morning before they woke up. Walking around a different town not knowing where the hell I went, I called my buddies. Turns out they were still in the city, they actually went home with some milfs lol. We met up for breakfast, had some laughs about the night then went home for father's day.

I then fapped later that night. I didn't / don't feel disgusted, but I will tell you things I did feel pre fap and post-fap:

**PRE-FAP**

* Felt energized / alert.

* Much nicer to my family (this was a huge one).

* No longer a grump.

* WAY more social / talkative.

* Felt comfortable cracking jokes and not giving a fuck.

* Went to the gym 5 days a week (still do).

* Some stints of frustration (due to not cumming).

* Adopted a ""I'm not attached to women"" mindset. This one is huge. 

* Ambitious. Getting shit done becomes my primal nature. Procrastination took a seat.

* I got a JOB. lol.

* Dick was way more sensitive / hard. I had sex with two women during this 13 day NoFap stint and my dick wouldn't go down after I came.

* I started approaching women again, at bars and during the day. Fuck online dating. Failed at times but also succeeded.

* Started recording music again.

**POST-FAP**

* Groggy. Brain fog. I'm still feeling the effects after two days.

* Bored.

* Less social. 

* I keep to myself. I don't initiate conversations. When I do, they're fucking boring. lol.

* Some social anxiety returned with women.

* Noticed I put women on a pedastle (sp?) more so then not.

* Negative attitude / voices in my head have come back a little bit.

Anyway, I've seen the effects of NoFap and yes, fapping was dumb but in retrospect I'm not tearing myself up about it. It felt like I ""woke up"" from life. Feels good to be in charge of your life, tackling all aspects of it. I had this unexplainable drive that motivated me to get.shit.done. I no longer had to look up motivation quotes or pictures.. I just 'was' motivated.

I have mastrubating at least 1 time a day for 6/7 years. Next month I will be 20 years old.
We all heard in our sexual education classes that mastrubation is perfectly healty. So I have been fapping almost everyday (sometimes binging) for a LONG time without knowing about any consequences it could have on my body.
Over-mastrubation is bad for you on two levels: **mind** (dopamine addiction) and **body** (nutrients you lose through your sperm). I want to talk about the effects on the body.


Everytime you ejaculate you lose SPERM. Sperm is full of minerals, vitamins and other healthy stuff from the body. But one of the most important ingredient is **zinc**. EDIT: You lose 0,3585 to 0,7055 mg zinc each load.
Source:  http://humrep.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/6/475.short 
So with a mastrubation addiction it's easy to get a zinc deficiency, even with an healthy diet. As long as I can remember I have walked around with white spots on my fingernails and I always thought that I had too little calcium in my body. But white spots is an indicator of a zinc deficiency! 


* **ZINC**

Zinc is used for a lot of important things in the body like immune system, growth, wound healing, taste and smell, hair, nails and skin (probably forgot a few).
**Zinc deficiency** can cause: 

Diarrhea

Low energy

Chronic fatigue

Infertility

stunted growth

Poor immunity

Bad memory

Inability to focus

ADD symptoms

slow wound healing

Irritability

Nerve dysfunction

Oily skin

Dandruff




A zinc deficiency can actually cause copper toxicity, because zinc is considered a primary antagonist to copper. The two minerals balance each other out in your body. When you have too little zinc, copper often accumulates in various storage organs in your body. 
So when ejaculating everyday you can easily get a zinc deficiency, wich could also lead that you have too much copper in your body.
I personally had the following symptoms: can't concentrate anymore, acne, oily skin, hairloss, dandruff and fatigued.
After 15 days since I started NoFap I can already focus better, more engergy, dandruff disappearing,
acne almost gone but still experiencing hairloss. (I have been taking 15mg of zinc from day 1)


* **COPPER**

Your body uses copper for healthy red blood cells, nerve function and connective tissue production.
As zinc, also copper can be toxic in big amounts. Copper and zinc balance each other out, so it's easy to get copper toxicity when having a zinc deficiency.

**Symptoms associated with copper toxicity:**

Tired body and an overactive mind

Anxiety

Acne

Hairloss

Migraine headaches

Cravings for high-copper foods such as chocolate or nuts

Depression and fatigue

Frequent colds, flues and viruses

Easy or frequent bruising, specifically capillary fragility

Mood swings

Tooth decay

Vitamin deficiencies




Symptoms I had: mood swings, anxiety, acne, fatigue and depression. Almost nobody in my family is bald, even my grandfather still has a head full of hair. Everytime I tough or wash my hair I can see hairs on my hand. My haircolour is brown/red, but the hairs that fall out are BLACK. Never understood it untill I read copper is responsible for your hair pigmentation.



So almost my entire teens I have been walking around with white spots on my nails, which ,I now know, means a zinc deficiency and most likely a copper toxicity. I have been worrying a lot lately because a lot of my problems can be related to this: hair loss, acne (all my friends haven't gotten acne for years and my diet and hygiene is almost perfect), growth retardation (my brother is 5 years younger than me and he is way taller than me, could also be genetics but still), concentration problems, depression.


I would love to hear **your opinion** on this and if you have the same symptons. **Also** before taking any supplements you should consult a doctor, because both zinc and copper can be dangerous if taken to much or to little.

I'm one of thousands recently threatened with a law suit for downloading (yes downloading, not uploading) porn from a particular company that monitors its downloaders on bit torrent and then collects smaller settlements from them so that the case never goes to public court. I paid out $6,000, which was more than I made the entirety of last summer, and I can't even look my mother in the eye. 

First I thought that the bit torrent was the problem, and saw myself as a victim of circumstance, but now I realize this is part of a much larger problem that affects all aspects of my life.  I am addicted to porn. After the bit torrent fiasco I started using internet sites.  Compared to HD videos from bit torrent, the internet was not stimulating enough. So I started looking for more and more extreme content. It got to the point where I was watching stuff that made me feel abnormal afterwards. For the past week, the sites I'd been visiting had been so extreme that I didn't even know if what I was watching was legal!

I'm awake now at 7:30 AM because I neglected to do an assignment for one of my classes until 4 AM because I was in my room watching porn for several hours.  This is affecting my sleep schedule and stress levels, which affects my life on every level, and it has become my most time consuming activity.

During my 1st attempt (this is my 3rd), I would read the pdf file to get my daily inspiration dose and would write down every reason which would get me excited.


They helped immensely to stay on track. Because when I would get strong urges to fap off, I would skim through the list and change my focus from desperation to inspiration.




You might say that it didn't really help me, but that's not true. I've set goals to reach 30 and then 50 days and succeeded both time. Not only I've got a taste of the benefits I've also learned how to make it easier for myself.

I learned to pause and ask myself if next action I'm about to do (e.g. image search 'Rachel Bilson bikini') is a step towards failure. If it's yes I would stop. So far this trial has been easiest so far (it's 100 days this time).

**Reasons**

* 1) Clarity of mind, no mental clutter
* 2) Better stamina in sports
* 3) Absence of depression, as in ""there's actually nothing wrong with me""
* 4) Better short term memory, grasp conversations, sharp and clear mind
* 5) Feeling worthy of hottest girls
* 6) Interacting with people goes from nuisance to fun activity
* 7) Facial hair grows faster
* 8) Music sounds better
* 9) Being cool with awkward situations
* 10) Past events are remembered better
* 11) Movies watched in one sitting, rather than interrupting it with distractions
* 12) Feeling of being really alive and feeling of having/being a powerful spirit
* 13) Better looking skin
* 14) Free, genuine belly laugh
* 15) Appreciation and admiration of women's inner and outer beauty
* 16) Less sleep is needed to feel rested
* 17) Much less irritability
* 18) Destructive erections
* 19) Improved chest, neck and shoulders musculature (without exercise in a particular case)
* 20) Vibrant and alive looking eyes
* 21) Voice is now clear
* 22) Reduced rage and anger
* 23) Movies, novels and art are appreciated much more
* 24) Better dream recollection
* 25) More wisdom on various subjects, without actually studying them. As in mind gets better at making connections.
* 26) Easier to get up in the morning
* 27) Like Neo in the Matrix, getting heightened senses and intuition
* 28) Enjoying company of kids and older folks
* 29) No more craving for sugar and alcohol
* 30) Urge to expand your mind
* 31) No more angry outbursts around the family
* 32)  ""Annoying"" things females do are now appreciated
* 33) A tangible magnetic connection with chicks
* 34) Chores are now easier to perform
* 35) Seeing ""big picture"" in life better
* 36) Ability to look at women and feel her, sense if her energy is good or bad
* 37) Ability to relate chicks like friends and seeing them flock to you
* 38) Nothing stresses you out anymore
* 39) Men respect you more

Not exactly a news flash, but I hadn't asked a girl out in over a year, so this is a pretty big deal in the scope of my little life. I doubt there really are any nofap superpowers, but a slightly heightened sense of self-respect can go a long way. I would not have asked my crush out if not for nofap.

This girl (hopefully my girlfriend soon) is a serious Christian, so there won't be any sex unless I convert to her religion and marry her (it could happen, but that would be a few years out at least). This kind of thing would have been a deal breaker back when I fapped a lot, but, as horny as this challenge sometimes makes me, I'm now more interested in the companionship aspect of a relationship. I suspect this is because I am seeing women more as people and less as attractive walking bodies.

Porn really does distort priorities, even if it doesn't really feel like it's doing any harm while you're in that world. I still crave porn almost every day, but I think this fog in my head might be abating. I know I have to be vigilant though; the deep pathways in my brain associated with porn will always be there, ready to control me again if I slip.

**TLDR: nofap helped motivate me to get a date with a girl I know I won't have sex with**

So I decided I would give up fapping and porn for lent. But I didn't want to have to tell everyone in my life that, so I broadened it out to ""no web browsing"" because for me, that would ensure no fapping. It worked! A couple of notes:

1. My trigger is absolutely porn (stories and images, I have given up movies for a while now.) With no porn, it is very easy to overcome any desire to fap.

2. There is a strong link between web browsing with no particular task when I am alone, and looking at porn. For me, it often starts with browsing, coming across some news story/post about a sexy woman, seeing an image of said woman, wanting to see more images of this woman, and then searching for terms that will give me more and more revealing images, until the psychological threshold is crossed and the desire to fap is too strong to overcome. 

3. It seemed perfectly normal to spend 2-3 hours online every day (not for porn, just in general), but once I gave it up for lent it really opened up quite a bit of free time to read, hang out with my girl, etc. It adds up to 14-21 hours/week, 56-84 hours/month, 672-1,008 hours/year. When you think about it like that, 2-3 hours a day seems excessive. What could you accomplish in the next year with 1,000 hours of your time?

If you are locked in the online/porn/fap cycle, maybe instead of just trying to break the porn/fap cycle, go one level up and seriously look at the amount of time you spend online. For me, making an adjustment to my total time online (basically 0, which is an extreme example) helped me to break through to 50 days.

Thank goodness!,virvirya,218,44,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/16v493/i_turned_down_sex_last_night_thank_goodness/,"I know this is NoFap, not NoSex, but I thought I would share. I'm traveling internationally for work right now, and last night a colleague and I were propositioned by some hookers at the bar. This happens all the time, and it's happened to me before. And I have accepted the offer before. Usually I just avoid them, but on the couple of occasions that I let them sit down and talk and drink with me, I have ended by indulging.

My colleague is a cool guy, but he's kind of a creeper sometimes. ~~And he was super into this girl~~, [EDIT: actually he seemed only mildly interested in her, but was all sniffing her neck and flirting anyway because she happened to be next to him and was available for inexpensive purchase] and kept hinting I should go with the other one. Here's the thing... I just didn't LIKE her, as a person. She was pretty, nice body, friendly enough all that. But I just got a vibe that was unattractive off her immediately. 

In the past I would have ignored my heart instincts it because, ""hey... sex!"" But today, waking up without a hooker in my bed, having some coffee and feeling ready to go out into the world in a cheerful ass-kicking mood... I have NoFap to thank for that. I'm changing inside, and I like it!

**UPDATE**: I was just in the gym here in the hotel, and the really cute girl who cut my hair yesterday came by and asked me out for drinks tonight. Just looking in this girl's eyes and talking to her, I could feel myself getting the beginnings of major arousal. I just wanted to tackle her right there on the gym mat. I haven't had that kind of natural reaction to a girl in a long time. And *she* asked *me* out. Haha!

In the old days I would have gone with the hooker, had horrible, shame-inducing sex, then skipped the gym cause I was feeling lousy — or if I went to the gym, I wouldn't be able to make steady eye contact with the girl and flirt confidently.

I started nofap with the goal of recovering from porn addiction.  I'd been struggling to quit porn on and off for at least a year and a half, probably more like two.  I'd succeed at not watching porn for a few weeks or so then give in to the urge to view it again, and end up binging and watching just as often as I always had.   I realized how badly I needed to change after some severe ED and sexual performance issues became apparent in a relationship.   

I stopped fapping for a few different reasons...mainly I was seeking the ""reset.""   I'd been watching porn for so long that it had completely taken over my sexuality.  Without it I was essentially asexual.  I wanted to deprive myself of orgasm to allow for a ""reboot""...I wanted to build up a new sense of sexuality, one centered around real women and completely detached from porn.

It worked!  My attraction to real women has magnified to levels it never had reached before nofap.  I appreciate the beauty of, and am powerfully attracted to, a much wider range of women than before nofap.  What's more, when I think about or yearn for sexual release now, it's real women I'm thinking about, not sitting on a computer and staring at the screen.  

ED-wise, I don't get spontaneous erections as often as I'd like, but I'm certain I'll respond well to sexual intimacy and perform well.   And my overall views towards sexuality are a million times healthier than they were when I was viewing porn constantly.

Within the last week I started to feel like I had reached my goal of liberating myself from dependence on porn, and like I was ready to start bringing some sense of pornless personal sexuality back in to my life without it feeling unhealthy to me.  So I'm shutting down the counter.

Stick with it folks.  It really does make a huge difference to liberate yourself from porn addiction.  The urges are the most difficult part because they are so powerful...I still get them sometimes.   With practice you develop your own strategies for recognizing and ignoring those urges, and eventually, when an urge strikes, you recognize it as nothing but the addicted part of your brain hoping for another fix, and ignore it.  And every time that happens, the urges weaken, and more importantly their power over your mind weakens.

As with others, during nofap I noticed some interesting changes...increased confidence, a tendency to feel emotions more richly and deeply...wonderful and surprising changes (I don't want to sensationalize but I did notice mostly positive changes!).   I still believe that these changes have more to do with having an addiction-free mind than any direct effects of fapping.   

The most important lesson I'll take away from this is the same lesson I took away at day 90.  If you see negative patterns in your life; things that are contributing to anxiety or insecurity, or unhealthy dependencies on insubstantial things, or repeated mental ""spirals"" that cause unhappiness and pain, you have the power to change them.  With determination, and support from others, and positivity (motivate yourself by positivity, it works much better than negativity), you can change what needs to be changed to live a richer life.",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,,True,t3_wt81y,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/wt81y/day_230_calling_it_quits/,
1373479626.0,177,self.NoFap,1i0ta7,10 Reasons I Don't Masturbate,ChooChooPoo,207,30,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1i0ta7/10_reasons_i_dont_masturbate/,"**[Days to the autumnal equinox:](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=days+until+the+autumnal+equinox) 74.1**

Day 10 and it's getting a little harder lately (lol sexual pun). So instead of relapsing (I didn't edge, but just *looked* at some softcore to the point of getting fully aroused) I thought I'd write and share 10 reasons I don't masturbate. It's important to remember these throughout.

**1. Numbed Pleasure Response.**

The more you masturbate, the harder it is to please yourself. It's as simple as that. You can't do *anything* without separating the action from the consequences. If you masturbate enough, you will numb yourself to [beautiful, beautiful women, their fantastic boobies,](/nsfw) and the excitement of seeing a beautiful woman on the street. I won't rob myself of that in exchange for 10 seconds of pleasure.

There's a reason that [beautiful woman looked so dang beautiful](/nsfw) online last night. I'm currently successful at rewiring my brain. I can't--I won't--throw that away for a fucking orgasm that means nothing and adds nothing to me or my life.

**2. You Don't Know What You Got 'Til It's Gone**

A lot of people say they don't notice any improvements, but after ten days, I *know* that if I masturbate, I'll instantly feel guilty and say ""and I was doing so well!"" Maybe it doesn't feel like you're doing great in the moment, but that's because you simply *don't notice* the exciting changes happening within you. I don't want to masturbate only to go ""aw, dang, look what I threw away!""

**3. Resetting the Counter**

Gosh, 10 days is a long, long time. You think I want to re-set it and see a big fucking **1** next to my name? Fuck that.

**4. Getting Semen on Something.**

Gross.

**5. Proper Dopamine Management**

I felt the rush of dopamine last night after looking at some attractive women online. You know what? That's lame. Dopamine is meant to motivate us to real-world action. It's not meant to motivate us to masturbate.

I want to use dopamine to overcome approach anxiety and talk to real life women (as it did the other day; I basically said ""that's it, I can't *not* talk to these women) with personalities and thoughts and identities all their own. Masturbation gets in the way of that.

**6. NoFap IRC**

I've been chatting in the NoFap IRC and I absolutely *don't* want to tell those guys ""I relapsed."" Avoiding this, in and of itself, is worth it.

**7. I Made a Commitment.**

[You can find it here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1hh5kj/my_solemn_promise_as_a_newly_minted_fapstronaut/). I said I'm not masturbating until at least the autumnal equinox and, codsarnit, I mean it.

For crying out loud, I called it a **solemn** promise. I'm not giving up that easily on a solemn promise.

**8. Discipline for the Sake of Discipline Is Results Enough For Me**

Superpowers? Motivation? Increased confidence? Decreased anxiety?

All great benefits of not masturbating. But discipline, to me, is a major virtue, and practicing discipline for the sake of practicing is enough for me.

I don't want to get in the habit of quitting on commitments. By not masturbating, I'm not just doing NoFap, I'm practicing dominating at *life*.

**9. I Like Myself More When I'm Not Masturbating**

Deep down, I must know masturbation is wrong, because I just *like* myself more now for not doing it. I like how strong I'm being. I *like* overcoming my biological urges because I want something more for myself.

**10. I'd Rather Meet a New Woman than Have an Orgasm**

I realized it last night; if I went outside today and met a beautiful woman and got her number, I would feel a million times better than I could ever feel with masturbating.

Ultimately, that's why I'm here: because momentary pleasure--no matter how exciting--does not stack up to a life well lived.

Thinking about relapsing? Don't. You have every reason in the world not to, and only one reason to. It's not worth it. Also, avoid those triggers, ladies and gents!

Day 11, here I come. Well, I won't *come.* But you get it.

*EDIT:*

Here are some bonus reasons for not masturbating:

* I feel less lonely
* There's nothing to clean up
* I feel more authentic to myself
* Life has renewed vividness and meaning",,False,,t5_2skrn,1373480356.0,,week3,True,t3_1i0ta7,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1i0ta7/10_reasons_i_dont_masturbate/,

---

**PAST:**

Like many here, I was exposed to masturbation at an early age, a year or more before entering puberty. Around age 13, I began to discover pornography through dial-up Internet on the computer in my room. Growing up in a Christian home, I always *knew* these things were wrong, even though my parents hadn't given me ""the talk"" yet. Eventually, I was caught, so Internet filters and restricted computer access curbed my addiction… for awhile. With the passage of time and the absence of discussion about sex, my parents operated under the impression that the problem had been cured. Filters went down, high-speed Internet came up. I never stood a chance.

Thus began over a decade of addiction to pornography and masturbation. This became my dark and secret identity, a character who operated in blatant contradiction to my convictions as a Christian. Since it was impossible to reconcile my private actions with my public life, I became adapt at adopting personas to fit the situation. The ""true me"" never came out - if he even existed during that time. It's as if I had been split into two persons, both of whom were unsatisfied with life.

I tried multiple times to quit my addiction, but I almost always made these attempts alone because the shame and guilt surrounding it kept me from asking others for help. The rare occasions when I did open up to others for assistance eventually ended in quiet awkwardness as I continued failing to make progress. I tried everything to get out of the rut of porn addiction, from counseling to antidepressants to an 11-week bicycle tour; many of these were helpful, but none were sufficient.

This community, /r/NoFap, changed that. On September 1, 2012, Internet browsing lead me to the NoFap September challenge, which I promptly joined. I somehow succeeded, ultimately reaching a 43-day streak before a careless relapse sent me into a series of weekly PMO sessions for about a month and a half. Finally, enough was enough; I undertook the NoFap 90-Day Challenge with renewed vigor, allowing me to stay clean through finals, clean through my 24th birthday, 1-month clean by Christmas, and clean well into the new year. The past 90 days were not without the occasional slip-up and viewing of porn, but I responded to each mistake with a way to avoid repeating it, leading to clear progress.

---

**PRESENT:**

This is the section most of you will be interested in: what's changed and what benefits I've gained thanks to 90 days of NoFap. I'll present it as a list.

* **Pride**. I know my life is on the right path, and I can look myself in the mirror and smile. I no longer need to hide my life.
* **Humility**. At the same time, I've learned my weaknesses and discovered the strength of relying on community for help. The best way to be served is to serve.
* **Emotions**. From unexplainable happiness to crippling sorrow, I now experience emotions like never before. Masturbation had numbed these extremes, leaving me dull and complacent.
* **Perseverance**. Even now, I experience daily temptation to relapse. I have gained the strength to live by my *deepest* desires rather than my fleeting feelings.
* **Joy**. I'm now able to make eye contact with strangers and genuinely smile. Such a simple thing, such a profound impact.
* **Friendship**. My closest friends have become even closer. After opening up to them about my battle with porn addiction, each admitted having the same struggles, and we now communicate like never before and hold each other accountable.
* **Faith**. My spiritual life, which had been dead for years, now grows with new life. I am no longer a contradiction of actions and convictions.
* **Hope**. No matter how difficult things appear at the moment, a better future now seems obtainable. I'm no longer stuck in place because of my addictions.
* **Love**. Although I have yet to meet her, I can honestly say that I love my wife. Staying pure from lust, working hard at my job to save money, studying to complete my college education: I do all these things out of love for my future wife.

Other than those intangible yet very real changes, I haven't experienced any ""superpowers."" To be honest, though, I've gained exactly what I sought through NoFap. My life is truly better, and it continues to gradually improve.

---

**FUTURE:**

So, what's next for me? Unquestionably, I will continue my NoFap journey. The final destination for me is a life free of pornography and self-gratification. My sexual passions and energies are not for me, they are for my wife; so I will gladly exercise self-control over my urges.

In the immediate future, I plan to adjust my NoFap badge next week to match the number of days I've gone without even edging. This will have the effect of ""resetting"" my badge to 91 days next Sunday, after which I plan to officially request an Elder Badge as a sign of my accomplishment and (I hope) helpful participation in this community.

On that note, I absolutely plan to continue contributing to /r/NoFap; first, because I find joy in helping others overcome the same struggles I face; second, because every time I've relapsed or come close to it was because I isolated myself from community for too long. Active participation in /r/NoFap and other communities helping men (and women!) gain freedom from the chains of pornography and masturbation is a *must* for my own continued progress and unshakable resolve.

My full ""reboot"" is not yet completed. I look forward to making additional reports at 120 days of NoFap, 90 days of PornFree, 6 months of purity, and 1 year of a new life.

**Summary (TL;DR):**

**My life is forever changed.** I cannot say with certainty that I won't relapse ever again, but I know that I never can, or ever will want to, go back to the way things were. The dull life of complacency is gone for good and has been replaced with passion in the present and hope for a future filled with joy.

Learned about fapping early in high school, and got addicted quickly. Until I was around 17, I couldn't go a day without PMO. It was all I thought about, almost all of the time. I had absolutely no confidence. It got to the point where couldn't even look a girl in the eyes for more than a few seconds. I was absolutely miserable.


The summer after my junior year, I quit watching porn cold turkey for religious and moral reasons. But even that wasn't enough. My imagination would run a bit too wild if I let my guard down. Confidence was slightly better, but fapping still controlled my life.


I spent most of my senior year of high school, as well as 3/4 of my first year of college debating with myself whether beating the one-eyed bishop was a sin or not, since I still adhere to my religious background. The only reason this debate lasted as long as it did was because I didn't see any Scripture that was explicitly against it. I was absolutely blind to the fact that fapping was a huge problem in my life. 


Eventually, that debate did come to an end. A week or so before I turned 19, a thought popped in to my head. How long was I going to keep fapping? Until I'm 25? 30? As much as I was engrossed by it, I still recognized fapping as something I didn't want to keep doing forever. At that point, I didn't care if it was a sin or not, I just wanted to drop the habit.


This was around the time that I learned about /r/NoFap. I had heard of people doing NoFap months from when I went on 4chan a lot. Never took it seriously, though. After reading through some of the posts here, I decided to join in the challenge. I could tell that it was working because of that testosterone spike after a week in, since the quality of speeches I had to give for a class went from terrible to awesome, then back down again. The first month or so was the hardest. It felt natural to fap. Got past it through meditation and prayer. I thought that if I got to Day 90, I could start fapping once a week. When I did get there, that attitude changed. I just didn't want to fap anymore. I grew apathetic towards it. Sure, I blue-balled a lot, but I saw it as a victory. Every blue-ball was a sign that I was taking back control of my life.


So here I am now, 180 days in. I leave you with this passage from Galatians 6, which has been a great motivator for me on my journey. I know that a good portion of Reddit doesn't share my beliefs, but please just take it as it is:

&gt;A man reaps what he sows. Whoever sows to please their flesh, from the flesh will reap destruction; whoever sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not give up.",,False,,t5_2skrn,False,,year1,True,t3_y4p0f,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/y4p0f/180_days_without_p_m_or_o_and_i_feel_fantastic/,

Withdrawal Symptoms

Energy, Motivation and Productivity

Confidence and Self-Esteem

Mindset, Focus and Other Mental Benefits

Social Skills

Women

Libido

Creativity

Exercise and Gym

Erections - size, sensitivity etc.

--------------------------


Please note that I've found NoFap to be an incredibly positive change in my life and I haven't found any real negative effect for giving it up, save withdrawals. In this regard, I may be overly biased in favour of NoFap.

I hope this post is helpful to whoever takes the time to read it.

---------------------------
Porn Usage Prior to NoFap

I discovered fapping by seeing porn for the first time when I was 12. Just some images, and naturally lead to some stimulation, and orgasm. From there, I fapped pretty normally, sometimes with softcore images, sometimes not. Eventually I found softcore fap material in magazines to be my primary fap-material at about 13. From there it went to animated/video-game girls (I know...) which naturally progressed into ecchi/hentai at about 15/16, when I found image-boards, alternating with softcore pictures on the internet. No videos at this stage. 

I eventually got into pretty healthy masturbation habits (once or twice a day) with ecchi/hentai/softcore pics mixed in here and there.
Eventually escalated into videos of regular porn on tube sites between 18-20, for at least one year solid. Did a lot of videos. 1-3 times a day, rarely any fap-free days. During this time I was gaming a lot, and porn/fap and gaming went hand-in-hand. Gave up gaming for 2010, and porn naturally fell away, also. Incidentally, it felt awesome for 5 months. Still fapping, not so regularly during that time. Got back into gaming, and back into porn again for another 5 months. Gave it up for 2011, again. Eventually had ""healthy"" fap habits for a while, but had some kind of feeling that giving up fapping made me feel better, just a hunch. Seemed kind of stupid at the time though.

Then I found yourbrainonporn.com in May this year. All of a sudden it all made sense. Before this, I just happened to have gone one week of NoFap, PRIOR to ever seeing or hearing about yourbrainonporn.com, or the 7-day cycle, or any kind of NoFap information, I felt the benefits people reported (approached by women, felt focused, motivated, energetic, better sleep etc.) So much for a placebo effect, right?

Anyways, so I got on the wagon, and this was going to be the hardest thing I've ever done. Failed 3 times between May and August with 15 to 25 day streaks in between.
Started my 90-day reboot on August 1st 2011.

---------------------------
Dealing with Urges

There's no quick fix for this one. You just have to push through it. I got out of the house as much as possible, avoided porn and edging entirely, and generally cutting off sexual fantasizing. Emotional Freedom Technique (youtube it) helped me quite a bit also, but it was mainly will power that pushed me through.

---------------------------
Withdrawal Symptoms

As I said, this is probably the hardest thing I've ever done. The withdrawals were terrible. They included:
Suicidal depression

Flu-like symptoms

Crying

Fluctuating Emotions

Extreme self-doubt

Tiredness, Laziness

Mild Insomnia

Complete lack of confidence

No desire to socialize

Very little desire to pursue women, no libido

Time-frame for withdrawals was roughly between days 1-3, whole of week 2 and 3. Some more in the beginning of month 2. Haven't noticed anything significant besides that. They may have fully cleared up. 

They were hell guys. Be prepared. Just push through them. Don't rationalize that it's better to just fap to avoid them or clear them, they will just come back if you try to No Fap again. I didn't realize how serious this was until these withdrawals hit. Take them as a sign of recovery.

-----------------
Energy, Motivation and Productivity

First benefits I noticed were my energy and motivation levels as well as my productivity. All of a sudden, a surf after gym didn't seem like a sweat. Getting my affairs sorted for college next year was a priority. Stuff got done before I fucked around. Procrastination was kept to a minimum, time-wasting was eliminated. Nothing to do? I made something happen. 

I started filling in my spare time with productive things. Eventually I had to start taking up new hobbies (yoga, salsa dancing, some more to come) to fill in the spare time. Other things include reading non-fiction books on topics of self-improvement, meditation, Emotional Freedom Technique (youtube it) and just general chores, cleaning etc. I still have a way to go, but I was surprised how much I wanted to get things done after the withdrawals cleared.

Waking up in the morning was no sweat. I beat my alarm on most mornings now. Some times it's a perfect 8 hours of sleep, and I get up at the same time consistently. I don't drink coffee or take sleeping pills or anything of the sort.

I have been motivated as hell to get my life on track and beyond. All of a sudden, everything is a goal, not an obstacle. ohropax mentioned this. (On a side-note, short-term, and long-term memory is improved, heh)

I finally understand what it feels like to be a man who has a hunger for achievement. There really is no way to explain the feeling except that it's a primal desire, a horniness for success.

Achieving goals, no matter how small, feels awesome. It's a great little boost to get a long the way.

-------------------
Confidence and Self-Esteem

Bam. This one will hit you out of the blue. Just after my withdrawals, I felt godly. Even though I wasn't really doing anything to feel good about myself, I was just hit with the strongest confidence boost I've ever had. I wasn't approaching beautiful women like a madman, networking with powerful businessmen or making friends like a socialite, but I definitely felt like the man, and I still do.

There were ups and downs, and still are, but for the most part, being confident, self-assured, and feeling like a high-self-esteem person has been my default state for a while now. This has definitely shown itself through my posture, eye-contact and general way of being. My voice still needs some work, but I have generally been projecting it louder and clearer than usual.

The feeling is what counts for me though. You'll know it when you get it.

---------------------------
Mindset, Focus and Other Mental Benefits

This was a big one. My whole mindset and perception of the world changed during NoFap. I understood what I was missing out on in my teens. My thinking used to be along the lines of having to deal with problems and every day was another hassle to get through. With NoFap, every day I wake up thinking about what's out there waiting for me, and I jump out of bed with this new outlook. (Morning woods help with this). I naturally adopted a go-getter attitude with this kind of thinking.

My outlook on life has become more positive, and I'm generally more optimistic than pessimistic, and sometimes surprisingly joyful.

My focus has been off-the-charts awesome. My attention span has increased, making conversations and remembering names easier, and my long-term memory has also improved. Remembering dreams, events, dates, important information, conversations, instructions and memories has been a lot more easier.

I'm less ""in-my-head"" in most situations and that voice in my head is a lot quieter. The mental benefits of NoFap are akin to meditation's benefits. People who practise meditation and/or yoga etc. will be able to relate.

-------------------
Social Skills

This was an eye-opener. I started having these uncanny conversational skills about a month into No Fap. All of a sudden, making jokes and puns was as natural as breathing. Eye-contact was solid, with men and women, especially women. People have commented on me being a good conversationalist.

I have a natural and healthy interest in people now, of both sexes. I enjoy finding out about people and what interests them, and that naturally makes interacting with people easier, more fun, and smooth. In my fapping days, I'd have to do a lot of thinking, and be in my head to think of good topics, jokes, or questions. Now it just flows, as if I'm playing a musical instrument.

Being able to sit with a bunch of friends isn't awkward anymore. It's relaxed and fun and I feel comfortable around people. For the first time in my life, I feel like I contribute to the ""vibe"" or the ""party"", if only in a small sense. I used to feel like I sucked the life out of everyone around me. Now I feel like people want me around more and more.

I've had friends invite me out, had deep conversations with people, and met new people with ease, of both sexes, as of late. It's no coincidence that I just happened to be NoFapping for a month before this started happening. As ridiculous as it sounds to new guys, I'm convinced no fap improves your social skills.

I chanced upon nofap in a forum I frequent. It has without a doubt **improved my life**.

My story:

I have PMO'd for about 7 years. I am a 22 YO male and have suffered from ED, PE, and DE. I was anxious, socially awkward, terrible with girls. It even came to rejecting girls through fear of ED.

Upon discovering nofap and the TED X Video I realised and **admitted** to myself I had a problem. After escalating extremities of porn, multiple tabs with 'just the right scene' to get me off, I knew I had lost myself to this addiction.

Nofap:

The first week was actually quite easy. I had momentum and my best friend was participating with me. I simply would not PMO. The habit was the hardest thing. I wanked before showers, so didn't take my phone to the bathroom. I suppressed urges by going for late night walks, press ups, also cold showers in the morning had a positive effect for the day.

At one month I had my first flat line. It lasted a week. I felt asexual, cold to women, agitated and frustrated. Just suck it up. Who said that this would be easy? You starving your brain of its usual dopamine rush.

My second flat line hit about 6 weeks and again at 2 months, but for a only a few days that time. It came in waves. I just went with the flow, I had resolved myself to do this.


I met my now girlfriend during nofap (and have wrote about it here http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/t9rfp/day_17_report_that_was_pretty_amazing/) 

From 6-8 weeks onwards things became pretty automatic. I simply refused to let myself fap or look at any porn, and day 100 here I am.


The benefits:

My main goal was to eliminate ED. I feel cured I have the best sex I have ever had in my whole life. Me and my GF connect and spark on each other like no other partner I've had. The sex is simply amazing, it's real.

I am so much more confident. I look other males in the eye, but don't seek to dominate or be aggressive. I speak clearly and don't worry about rejection.

I go to the gym 3 times a week and take my protein shakes. This has always been something I have been saying I would do, and now I finally do. I am getting bigger too!

Nofap has made me evaluate my life, and make better choices and act on them faster.

I am positive about life and see possibilities and a future. I yearn to take on new projects and better myself.

I have strong erections (and do keggels). I also get hard simply through kissing. It has been referred to as the bonor hormone somewhere on this reddit and its accurate. When I kiss my partner I get aroused. I haven't looked at porn intentionality, but I don't think it would arouse me as much as my partner could!

I have became a sexual beast. I am nearly always horny, but I don't mind, and I won't bother my partner if she isn't feeling horny. I love feeling so alive.

Nofap has improved my life drastically. I am so so grateful I found this site. I thank you, my brothers and sisters. You are an amazing community. I joined at 11k members, how we have grown!

**tl:dr Nofap is a choice. Your choice. Choose to be the person you want to be, who you WILL be. This is my first nofap attempt, through mental willpower I choose not to relapse.**

Happy to answer any questions. I still visit nofap daily, I love the stories and if I can help anyone with advice I will.

I can't blame anything other than myself. I chose to stay in bed instead of getting up and doing something else. Anything else!  

But at the same time, I refuse to wallow in self pity. I am not the man I was last year when I started this journey. I relapsed 3 days in a row before my 11 month streak. My ""streak"" before that was 3 whole days.  

So I am psyched that I made it 11 months. And I am so grateful that my /r/pornfree badge is safe and sound. The battle is unique for each of us, for me NoFap is a shield between me and porn. My shield is broken but my resolve is still strong. It may take me 11 months to get my shield back the way it was. But by then, I will be almost 2 years porn free. And that is the most important goal for me. 

Thanks for reading and remember, no one is safe. We are never ""cured"" but we can win. Also, for god's sake don't ""test"" yourself!!  An innocent fantasy can turn into a relapse faster than you can say ""Bonehead move, dumbass!"".

Edit: I just wanted to reiterate something that I said in the comments because its important. Don't feel guilty about your relapses. I know it's not easy and I'm NOT saying you should relapse with abandon!  What I mean is IF a relapse should happen look at it as a learning opportunity on what NOT to do. Push the feelings of shame aside. Those feelings will only bring back memories of your past binges and make it easier for Scumbag Brain to convince you that it's ok to binge.  It really helps to try to look at this scientifically and not get too emotional about it. Emotions can be triggers too.

I fapped Monday and Tuesday.

When I fapped, something triggered in me. I have this pheromone theory (which may or may not be valid) that says that if you haven't gotten any in a while, your body secretes certain hormones that make you more attractive. This theory can be incorrect, but for me it functions as a placebo. Ever since I fapped, I've been feeling less worthwhile and less masculine. When I do nofap for about a week, I notice during that week I'm much hornier and much more inclined to go talk to girls, and now that motivation isn't there.

My advice to you, is if for some reason you think it's a good idea to fap, chances are it isn't. If the worst part of your day is you are horny, then that's a pretty good day, but if the worst part of your day is that you feel like less of a fucking man, that's not a very good day.

I just wanted to share something: I feel pretty darn good most of the time.

I had two big problems from constant PMO when I started:

* I just wasn't really horny enough to pursue real women. Spent all my sexual energy on porn.

* Chronic low energy and low mood.

Well, I'm really happy. Both those things cleared up around the 8th day. That was right around when I started to notice, ""Hey, it's *easy* to get up in the morning. Hey, I can put in 11 hours at work, and do a good job the *entire time.* Hey, women look *great.*""

Most importantly, this is literally the first time... in my life... that I've had enough energy... to actually *care* about life. And *try.* About creating a better life for myself. I'm doing great on all fronts: relationships, work, health.

I don't want to say nofap is responsible for that. Hardly! Every day I'm paying the price in courage to grow. But without that *extra energy,* it would just seem... out of reach. 

Guys, you gotta give this a go if you haven't yet. Especially if you're a bit older like me. At 28, I'm feeling like I'm 22. You younger guys? You'll have boundless unstoppable energy. Yeah, the urges will be way worse. (I don't get that many urges.) But the payoff is three times stronger.

As a brief update to my [fairly comprehensive report](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/sdpwz/day_215_full_report_tldr_alert/) of Day 215, I'll just add a couple things:

* When last I reported, I was still experiencing occasional swings in libido; I'd have an extreme urge to fap some nights, and no sexual interest some other nights.  The swings were getting rarer, and my sex drive getting stabler, but it was still happening.  It is not happening anymore.  My libido is now the same from day to day.  It is present, and I am grateful to have it, throughout the day (it feels kinda nice to be horny, you know?), but it is very much under my control (which is even nicer).  The only time I start to lose control of my sexuality is when my fiancee is close.  And I think that's how it's supposed to work.  :)

* During most of my NoFap, I was heavily making out with my then-girlfriend on a regular basis.  No sex, and only occasional orgasms, but it was an outlet for me.  A few weeks ago, we were at a marriage prep class put on by our church, and the lecturing priest suggested that all the engaged couples give something up until the marriage as a way of preparing -- like during Lent.  He was thinking a fast from chocolate or soda, but my fiancee and I decided to fast from making out (my idea, not hers).  We're limiting ourselves to two or three passionate kisses at a time for the final four months before the wedding day.  When we started our fast, I was afraid that losing my one outlet would put me under pressure to fap again.  It hasn't.  Not one bit.  My sexuality is *mine* now, and the only thing I want to do with it is fuck her.  

* I'm not *enjoying* this fast, though.  Giving up make out sessions is not fun.  Fasting isn't supposed to be; it's supposed to help you focus on the big picture, which in this case is the mutual self-sacrifice required to have a successful marriage.  In that, it is succeeding.  But I can't wait for it to be over.  I miss her boobs!  I've also noticed that, without the physical side of romantic expression, I've been a lot more needy about the verbal/emotional side of it.  I've been unsubtly encouraging her to tell me she loves me a lot more, because her shuddering body isn't saying everything that needs to be said.  The physical stuff in a relationship is super-important, guys and gals!

* It turned out to be harder to quit porn than to quit fapping.  It's been a year since my last fap, but only 40 days since the last time I slipped up with porn.  (I now maintain a separate badge on /r/pornfree.) My porn use has been *dramatically* curtailed, but it has still been tempting from time to time.  I feel like the Great Porn Beast of temptation is finally in my rear-view mirror, though.  My main goal right now is to get 120 days of PornFree under my belt before my wedding day -- which leaves me with very little margin for error!

* There's no way I could have made it this far with my NoFap streak without severely cutting down on my porn.  There's also no way I could have made it this far with my NoPorn without quitting fapping entirely.  The two are inextricably linked for me.

* My social life has only continued to get busier, to the point where it actually annoys me how many friends I have who can distract me from the computer.  Tonight, I'm off to play Diplomacy for the first time.  I'd much rather noodle with the story I'm writing and surf reddit, but, as I have to do so often, I'm going to haul myself out of this chair and hang out with some real people.  I'm doing this because I know that, by the end of the night, I'll be happy I did.

* Wet dreams are less and less common.  From once every three weeks or so, their frequency has fallen to once every two months or so.  Weird!

* A year ago, in the late hours of Sep. 13 -- when I had my last NoFap failure, after a 4-day streak -- I firmly believed that, despite my best efforts, I would fap again within 24 hours.  Certainly I did not believe I would be able to top my previous record of 123 days.   If you'd told me right after my last fap that I'd be writing a one-year update twelve months later, I'd've laughed in your face (or possibly cried).  I had been through this cycle too many times to have any real hope left; all I had left was my stubbornness.  And yet here I am a year later.  Two lessons: (1) When NoFap finally ""clicks"", it may come not when you feel most hopeful, but when you feel most hopeless, and (2) be more stubborn than your masturbation habit.

(I've always been more of an introvert.)

I've been much more productive and creative during this time too, it's as if weights/shackles have been removed from my brain allowing its liberation.  My thoughts are much clearer now.  Intrusive thoughts and porn flash-backs are much less now.  This helps me become very focused when I'm working, instead of consciously fighting off unwanted thoughts.  It's like hearing that ekg-flatline of just pure focus at times, i.e. being in the zone.

Physically, I have gained 10lbs of muscle. I have been lifting weights after not doing so for years. I stand straighter now and am taller. Fapping was curving my spine/enlarging a shoulder --- I am around an inch-taller than I was a year ago (I'm 26). My voice is also more grounded, deeper and generally more confident sounding now.

Walking around in public without viewing life through an unwanted lens of pornography/sexcraze is wonderful. I see people more for what they really are and look at women and think about them more as a person and wonder what their life is like. I can remember a time where everything I saw was in my mind processed as sexual. This used to frighten me and I always wanted it to go away, it made me a shell of a human.  

I don't have a girlfriend. This is something I've really wanted for a long-time, I've been single for years, but I'm not so worried anymore.  Not everything has fallen into my lap since doing nofap, but what's important to me is that I have become a better person.  It's said luck is preparation meeting opportunity, and I'm becoming more and more prepared everyday.

100-days is only the beginning for me, I see no point in ever returning to the prison of porn-masturbation-orgasm.  Every day I make it, the urge fades further away into obscurity where it belongs.  

I sit and wonder about how much I could have been, what I could have done, but more importantly... what I CAN do going forward, what I CAN become, and what I AM becoming.

Lately I have seen a trend of posts  proclaiming going for the first week/days of nofap and admitting to losing their virginity or having crazy sex and gaining some super human traits.

Now I'm happy for you but upvoting those type of posts only reinforces  false hope to the majority of the members here.

Also another thing that I have noticed is that when a member of the team fails they would post on how they feel they have failed... first of all you haven't failed, please stop posting the same posts over and over again. Keep on trying and don't give up.

I have been relapsing for more than 5 months now and nofap itself has turned into trigger because it's a constant reminder of porn and masturbation and failure. 

Please try to motivate each other in posts and even contribute motivating material that doesn't entail on how you had steamy sex for the first time.

The nofap that I had felt in love with was about self actualization and enriching your own self in many ways that some of us had never thought was possible. Now it seems its main focus is about getting laid or losing ones virginity.

Many of you here are not addicts and I appreciate you guys as much as the next person who's an addict but please try to understand how difficult it is to try to quit a terrible habit for many years on and on while it has been eating at you until you're left with just a shell.

The nofap that I remember when we had less than 400 members was more of a finding ones self than becoming militant, lets remove the us vs them mentality. 

Porn has been in society for a long time in the human psyche and only recently has become norm for people to talk about it and accept it as a form of recreational time.

Since we have become organized in through the inter webs lets please make the best use out of it as we have done throughout its course of life, we are a group that has been affected by the use of porn and masterbation and the only thing that we have going for us is the sense of belonging and not feeling alone in this.

Lets keep on going and reach our goals :)

Sorry for the long post but I had to get it off of my chest.

You can not handle it if she is not interested. That's why you will never go talk to her. Your loneliness is something you want to hide because it is simply embarrasing because it is totally your own fault. There is no way anyone would feel sorry about it, because it didn't just happen to you. No, it is you who made it happen.
Fapping takes this feeling away for a few moments. After closing the browser the result described above is back and now even more intense.

**If you don't fap**
You also feel alone. While being alone is certainly not the nicest thing in the world, you don't get desperate because of it. You feel like if girls knew they would kill to meet you. They would see a big opportunity. That is why you can relax. You are alone but it won't be forever. You can be yourself and it will be good to be yourself. If you talk to a girl and she makes signals that she is not interested, you can handle it. You will always just do your best being you. In fact, you will find interest in yourself once you start to become distinct from all the other consumption addicts. Start something. Be social. Help people. Create something others can benefit from. Become interesting. Not only for girls. If you are not successful today then maybe some other day. As long as you are YOU.

I'm 45, with a 15-year PMO habit, and when I started NoFap I'd recently ended a long-term relationship. I was depressed and feeling sorry for myself. Among the main reasons for my separation were persistent ED on my part, extreme difficulty in having and expressing feelings, and self-esteem and confidence issues. Just as things ended I watched the Great Porn Experiment video and connected the dots between sexual problems and porn use for the first time. This was good, because instead of going on a self-pity binge that could have gone on for months, I decided to start the 90-day challenge without delay.

The first two weeks were really hard. I was very horny all the time, and I basically had to power through, hour by hour and almost minute by minute. I followed two rules: not to direct my eyes to anything that  found arousing, and not to touch my genitals. 

Over weeks 3-4, and I started to become conscious of my main triggers, which surprisingly were not sexual desire, but sadness and anxiety. At this point my feelings seem to have thawed out for the first time in years, and I was emotionally all over the place, and crying very frequently.

Around day 35 I had a sexual reunion with my ex, just the one night, and was able to verify that my ED problem was a lot better, and that I was much more emotional than before during sex. This didn't save the relationship, but allowed me to see that things were moving in the right direction, which motivated me for the long haul ahead.

After around day 20, I seem to have gone into a strange flatline from which I have not yet fully emerged. Meaning my body is responsive in sexual situations, but outside of that I don't have any desires and I never have morning wood or spontaneous erections. Well, I do have desires, but they're not sexual; I feel a strong desire for warmth and affection, and that's what pulls me to women more than straight physical attraction.

After day 35, and up to day 60, things went well. Nofap still felt like walking a tightrope, that if I let down my vigilance I would fall off and relapse, but the rope widened to a plank, so that it took less effort to balance and I would only relapse by conscious choice. The main challenge was not fapping per se, but dealing with the big triggers, namely the continuing depression and loneliness of separation.

Around day 65, something changed. I felt I was coming to terms with being alone. That I could live the rest of my life without a woman or sex if necessary. The prospect felt a bit sad and cold, but it no longer agitated me at all. I read some Stoic texts at this time which were a big help.

At day 75, I met a woman at a friend's birthday party - she was very attractive, and also a recent divorcee. I didn't feel exceptionally confident, but neither did I suffer from any lack of self-esteem as before. I just felt good to be in my skin. I also felt capable of talking about my feelings, both in relation to my situation and in relation to her. And I felt confident enough to get her number, and to follow up on the initial contact, so that despite some initial resistance we became friends and started seeing each other every day, or almost. She said what made the difference was my capacity to express my feelings so well and to be so natural. 

Yesterday, on day 90, we slept together for the first time. My performance was not great, because I'd drunk a fair amount at dinner, but she didn't seem to notice and looked like she really enjoyed herself. Somehow the whole ED issue just didn't seem like such a big deal any more. We'll see where this goes from here.

A couple of other things to mention. I did hard-mode throughout these 90 days, with the exception of that one night on day 35. I did not edge or watch porn at all. 

What I did do, and I feel it set my progress back somewhat, was look from time to time at a stash of erotic pictures I had of my ex. This didn't count as porn, as these were pictures I'd taken - but, well, it was borderline. I deleted them several times, but then used file recovery software to get them back later. I guess I was still too attached. Now I intend to get rid of them for good, with some proper erasing software. So that was the weak spot in my 90 days. Not perfect by any means.

What also helped me a lot was doing art therapy classes every week, sometimes several times a week. This taught me to get in touch with what was going on inside and give it a concrete expression on canvas. All my emotional states became more fluid, and I felt a direct benefit in communicating with people because I could get in touch with my feelings and put them into words so easily. Of course, the only reason it worked in the first place was that nofap moved me out of the state of emotional numbness in which I'd been years. Exercise also helped - I've been doing martial arts regularly through this period.

One area in which I've had a lot of difficulty is work. My concentration is down, now that there are no quick fixes for anxiety or depression; and also my motivation is down, because it seems more important to spend time with other people than hanging around alone with my laptop. Still, I'm doing enough to get by.

In retrospect, the whole business of masturbating for hours in front of a screen, alone in the middle of the night, while my partner and children slept, seems so sad and such a waste of time and opportunities, whole years that I will never recover. 

All my gratitude goes out to you, fellow nofappers, for your wisdom and support in getting me out of this self-made hell. I hope this post helps motivate someone, so I can give back a little to the community. Thank you.

Edit1: I've just deleted the stash of pictures I still had, zipped up on a hard disk out of easy reach. So they're gone. I'll get the disk cleaned more thoroughly later so they can't be retrieved. It's not just the erotic value, they had a lot of sentimental value to me. But it's time to cut the ties from that part of my life and move on. Thanks, your promptings moved me to action on this issue.

Edit 2: I'm overwhelmed by your very positive comments and wishes. I wish each of you total success in nofap, and a better life beyond these 90 days of hardship.

**My story starts like this:**

As most of you, I started fapping from an early age, without noticing, fapping changed my perspective about sex, as time passed by I was needing more hardcore porn than before. I unconsciously jumped from fapping at magazines like Playboy to feeling unsatisfied with 1 fap per day on hardcore porn.

I felt like this had to stop... But what to do I asked myself ?

-Well stop watching porn my inner voice mumbled...

-No ! That's way too hard ! Said my ego. 

-Well let's try it for a while and see what happens I said to myself.

I deleted all my porn videos and promised to myself not to enter on any porn websites and only fap using my own imagination !

During this period (5 months), I reduced my fap ratio from 1Fap per day to 1Fap per week.

How I felt ? 

Well I felt great, but I knew I could do better ! 

But why doing it better ? Why NoFap at all ? Am I a weirdo ? Who the hell doesn't Fap at all ?

**On 4th of February I was on my 6th day streak and I was almost preparing to fap when something changed my life !**

I have found you guys ! The NoFap Community ! 

I said what the fuck ? What is this ?

I could't believe my eyes, I wasn't wrong at all ! There really are a lot of ""weirdos"" like me !
On that same day I also found out www.yourbrainonporn.com and read everything I could and made a decision ! 
I'm gonna do it from first try ! 90 days ! I know I can !

**The 90 day period:**

The first two weeks were the hardest, although I haven't watched porn for 5 months it was really tempting to jerk off taking in consideration that I'm spending almost all my time on my pc...

During this period I made some rules:

* 1. Don't break the chain - create your own chain here - http://dontbreakthechain.com
* 2. No porn seeing on my pc (not even images or text that trigger my mind into fantasizing about sex) 
* 3. No boner during hot showers
* 4. No dick touching except shower &amp; piss
* 5. No fantasizing about sex, if so, fast change your mind to something else
* 6. If horny - push ups
* 7. If horny - cold shower
* 8. If horny - go for a run

Day 14-&gt;30, things started to get better, each morning when I woke up I marked a day on the Don't Break The Chain Calendar, that helped me a lot !

Day 30-&gt;45 I started to feel really good, I had the ""superpowers"", confidence, focus, discipline, I truly felt that ""If I can do NoFap for that long I can do whatever I want"" it was all inside me and now I have discovered it ! I started changing other things in my life, waking up early, no procrastination on silly things, these were my good days and NoFap was like an engine, keeping other good habits going !

Day 45-&gt;70 Don't you think that during the 90 days you'll experience only ""honey and milk"" feelings, you'll have your bad times, we all do, when having bad days, not fapping gave me confidence. It felt like an anchor, helped me not to drift away. When a voice in my mind was putting to doubt my power of will, an other replayed ""How many friends do you have which have your power of will ? How many can maintain such a long streak ? You are a great guy ! Keep on with the good work !""

Day 70-&gt;90 I would've better killed myself instead of fapping, that was my mindset, after 70 consecutive mornings when I was marking on the calendar, day after day, to lose it all for 5 seconds of pleasure ?
NO WAY ! I'm better than that !

**Conclusions:**

Why should I give up porn &amp; fap ?

First of all your brain will rewire, watching porn daily changes your perception about women, you see them as a piece of meat which you only use to satisfy your desires, but you're not conscious of that, you think women also love being fucked hardcore like you see in movies.
Well, that's only an illusion, most of the women are romantic beings, and they surely like being treated in this way.

You'll gain discipline, confidence, focus on whatever you are doing, an accentuated sense of present than before, eliminate/reduce procrastination, etc.

It will help you during your bad times - Before NoFap when I had bad days, on those days I felt unuseful, good for nothing, not sure of myself. 
Nowadays when having a bad day I ask myself: Who can do what I can ? Who can master his desires like I do ? 
Yeah that's me !

Love you all ! 
I'll continue my streak for... forever ! 
Don't lose faith in yourself !

**TL;DR**

* My story starts like this: If you can't renounce to porn &amp; fap, try a PP-Preparatory Period of one month for example, when you fap without using porn. During this period you'll see that the urge to fap daily will soon dissapear.
* The 90 day period: This one you got to read for yourself !
* Conclusions: Do you want to become a better person ? Do you want to be more confident on yourself ? A more disciplined person ? Don't you hate when you can't focus on your job ?

How I got here:
       I was dissatisfied with my erectile dysfunction that struck the majority of the blue-moon occasions which I have attempted to have sex in recent years. This past November, in one of our three-hour chats, my friend S briefly mentioned something about watching pornography, an activity I had taken part in for more than eight years, and the rewiring of your brain. ""3 months without that garbage will redo your brain,"" he quipped.
       I was curious. I weeded out porn and masturbation from my life to test myself; the compulsion dwindled to weekly use. I felt the same with and without it, then. I still loved watching porn; I convinced myself to keep at the routine. It provided me with something. A month later, I attempted to have sex for the first time since being aware of what S had told me; unsurprisingly, per usual, I could not get aroused at all. I spent the remainder of that night puzzled: why did my mind want to deprive my body of pleasure? I curiously scoured the internet.
       A wealth of information appeared in the browser. I absorbed the topical knowledge, but a result for [YourBrainOnPorn](http://yourbrainonporn.com) was the most comprehensive regarding **porn-induced erectile dysfunction**. I never heard of this phenomenon. I watched [""The Great Porn Experiment""](http://youtu.be/wSF82AwSDiU), and was instantly changed. Gary Wilson (whose name intrigued me to due to his sharing it with [a funky musician's](http://youtu.be/YiLlDISaI-w)) spoke consistent truth: I found myself in each sentence. The science yielded convictive tears. I reflected on…

My life with porn:
       I am a college sophomore. Ever since Spring Break 2004 when I was a fifth-grader and my parents nastily divorced, pornography was an important part of my life. I was immediately obsessed. High-speed internet, ""today's internet porn"" that Gary Wilson describes in his lecture's conclusion, had taken off not too long ago; tabs, tabs, tabs clouded my browser. The internet grew; my tastes changed. The activity manifested itself in the most inappropriate settings: My sister's room? My buddy's closet? My best friend's aunt's living room? My grandparents' house? There was an attached rush since I have never been caught handed. Thus, no one knew about what I did when I was not around, which added value to the vice's allure.
       My thrilling search for products of the highest quality bloomed amidst the internet-porn industry's bubbling—more appropriately, its erection. In discussions with my best friends, they all openly discussed their preference for available amateur porn. On the contrary I enjoyed the content offered by premium sites Bangbros, Brazzers—to whatever I could find account information. Gathering functioning passes to these quality sweets made my month; their eminent disappearance ruined it. **The unreal image of large asses and huge penises was my primary representation of sex**. I was not sexually active with the outside. I would not succeed with women I lackadaisically pursued; I had not had a girlfriend, my first and only, since 2009. I allowed my umbilical porn tie to dominate me.
	More recently, the conversations with my senior buddy S provided me with the bread crumbs of transformation. Through our talks, I identified with S: his past introversion, his exposure to pick-up artistry, his ability to laugh, his addiction to porn, and his desire to better his self. I admired him, and myself thus, for these traits. I heavily weighted S’s aforementioned fact: how my usage could figure into this. I toyed with the idea to gauge my response; however, increasing stress from studies was an excuse for keeping at the routine.
       After finishing a paper that took an entire weekend to write, I watched porn for the last time in an attempt to wind down. Winter break was eminent; I could freely decompress. Here, an unrealized sexual encounter occurred. I remembered S's words; I did the research. Ultimately, for my self-improvement, I made the boldest decision I could. I found my way onto r/NoFap and claimed my badge. December 19, 2012: after eight-and-a-half years, I embarked on…

My life without porn:
       (To preface, my life has been changing in spurts since December 2011 when I came to the realization that I need other people. In my youth, I felt that anything could be accomplished through myself without assistance. This perpetuated a loneliness mistaken for solitude, other negative qualities; ultimately, my addiction to porn/fap. In May 2012 I was rejected by the girl I crushed on after making my infatuation explicit; I was terrified of rejection for my entire life. This was the first time I did something like this. I felt great afterward, regardless: being rejected was much more satisfying than remaining uncertain! Two months later, I was able to love myself when I looked in the mirror. I finally erected the self-confidence I needed to persevere. [(These two events influenced this.)](http://youtu.be/LOrGxxNEhy4) My relationship with my parents improved, especially my father. Despite a loving relationship, I never voiced my desires and dissatisfactions toward him—or anyone in my life! I finally spoke to him as an adult—honest—and our relationship has been great since. The next semester, interactions became much more lucid. I still fap’d and poured so much energy into pornographic thrills. Unmet potential—in myself, others—perturbs me ineffably. Again, my buddy S briefed me on the benefits of a life without fap. This is, along with Gary Wilson's lecture, the impetus for my biggest milestone.)
       My decision thrilled me. I informed those closest to me of my plans; various friends of excess scoffed, putting fap/porn on its absurd pedestal. Some applauded my will. My parents supported me. I spread the gospel to my friends whom I knew delved in porn. Just because they made it clear they watched porn does not mean they watched it with the (ir)regularity I did. I assumed that everyone else fapping partook in the volume of porn I had!
       I wore the spirit of NoFap on my sleeve. It was most efficient for me to do so. **The effects of NoFap are true; zeniths in self-confidence, drive, passion, clearheadedness, among other intangibles are optimally reached. These are self-fulfilling; they need to be.** I never experienced the magnitude of these qualities until now. From an early age, I allowed porn to sculpt me into a bookish recluse who socially failed. Any shortcoming in my life could be generated into a fap excuse; this ultimately squandered my impulse to do anything—fap was my release. Now, I decided against release, in my traditional sense. The energy—oh, the energy!—I applied toward my excursions was now used elsewhere.
       A list of what I have accomplished over this 90-day period:
	
* Travelled to Kyrgyzstan. [(It looks a little something like this.)](http://imgur.com/a/KJGLa) I recorded over an hour's worth of golden material. I am compiling it into a short film at snail's pace due to other priorities. It is beautiful. This trip revitalized my desire to travel, especially with a camcorder in hand. The sense of being an other wherever is exhilarating. I got accepted to Taglit-Birthright Israel in May—a free ticket to/from Israel!—and will travel to other neighboring countries. I am ecstatic.
* [Totaled my car](http://i.imgur.com/MAoXFGr.jpg). I tapped an ambulance's back wheel.
* [r/NoPoo](http://reddit.com/r/nopoo). No more dandruff.
* Had one of my first wet dreams. I estimate having three before NoFap. I had a total of three during this period; most recent, this week. Disappointedly, I am certain that one was influenced by the remnants of pornographic images in my unconscious. (Does this violate r/pornfree? Seriously!) I woke up with morning wood a few times. It never happened much before, so let it be noteworthy.
* Stopped smoking. I began smoking in August 2010; a carton would last me three weeks. I lost interest during last October, but have cut off completely since. Once you kick one addiction, it is simple to kick the rest! Now, I am addicted to not being addicted to things.
* Listened to 231 albums. For me, this is a gigantic figure and might be the biggest reward of my NoFap. I have so much music on my iPod from eight years of collecting music: currently, 13,000+ songs, 1,300+ albums. I listened to a fraction of that collection throughout the near-decade; there are albums on myPod that have been there for these years and are gone untouched. I enjoy having a response to the music: +/-. The immense jazz and electronic/ambient selections I have were incredibly suitable for the workload of my curriculum. The wavering qualities of the music amplified my challenging literature. I recommend: Steve Reich's [*Music for 18 Musicians*](http://youtu.be/E_jwv2QMtAo); Charles Mingus's [*The Black Saint and the Sinner Lady*](http://youtu.be/zl4-BshBIVA); a lot of Fela Kuti; Michael Jackson's [*Thriller*](http://youtu.be/3ppnY0yy-us_); Pat Metheny Group's [*Letter from Home*](http://youtu.be/pJE3QiLr92U) and [*Still Life (Talking)*](http://youtu.be/vHG5BYRZQIQ). I have to make time for more hip-hop!
* [Recorded this.](http://youtu.be/flTHzaCApEU)
* Dropped my phone in the sink. I upgraded to a smartphone, but I keep it in my pocket as much as possible. Sitting on the phone, albeit socially acceptable, is analogous to fapping. It is keeping you from noticing the world around you!
* Read seven books. I used to be a voracious reader, and then fapping overtook. I recommend two from these 90 days. *The Autobiography of Malcolm X* is one of the most gripping tales bounded; at the book's finish, I could not help but sympathize with Malcolm. His later outlooks have been influential, allowing me to empathize with more people. [*No More Mr. Nice Guy!*](https://7chan.org/lit/src/Robert_Glover_-_No_More_Mr_Nice_Guy.pdf_ ) by Robert A. Glover is a great read for a lot of us at NoFap because we possess a lot of the characteristics he divulges—the characteristics which lead us to heavy fappage in the first place. Sigmund Freud's *Beyond the Pleasure Principle* was a peculiar read. I am currently reading a William Blake compilation and beginning *The Tao of Badass* today.
* Kissed two girls I knew from when I was in high school; I never made any advances toward them then but had always wanted to. Though they did not reciprocated, I felt comfortable in putting myself out like that which my high-school self was completely against. (Before, I had kissed eight girls, showered with four.) I also got two phone numbers today! I feel more comfortable around women. Whenever I have approach anxiety, I find a way to constructively get rid of it by going ahead: approaching. I am less anxious for the next time. I am becoming more understanding. Occasional dips into the lairs of r/seduction + r/askseddit, etc. have been beneficial. Also, it is not that women began noticing me. I began noticing them noticing me. It is (and it turns out that I am) a sight for sore eyes! Smile more in the streets.
* Watched 35 movies. The figure is relatively low considering I am an English major with a film concentration; however, I am content with this due to my aforementioned intake of books and music. Federico Fellini's *Amarcord*, Chris Marker's *Sans soleil*, Luis Buñuel's *That Obscure Object of Desire*, and The Marx Brothers' *Duck Soup* were my favorites of this period.
* Cemented my musical group and played my first show. I have found someone in my (college) town—we are from the same city in South Florida, coincidentally—with whom I can bounce ideas. It is a great feeling for me because I have never seriously collaborated with someone, musically, outside of improvisations. Conceiving lush music, with another, is beyond rewarding for me. Currently writing, he and I will record material in the summer. It will be glorious.
* Drank no milkshakes. I used to pound three to four weekly. I crave sugary things more often than before. I often ignore these drives, and continue going about my activities.
* Cleared my history once. Let this speak for itself….
* Started yoga. A friend teaches at my gym. It is a beautiful way to start a Saturday. I feel great after! I also resumed my daily push-up routine with good results.
* Developed more fruitful relationships with men. After the age 10, I was raised in a household with a constant woman figure, with no men—sans young, little me. My mother taught me how to be a man; not my father. In the end, there was something missing from my equation. Much how Glover describes in No Mr. Nice Guy!, women cannot show men how to be men—men must do that. The man who portrays himself as the man that a woman wants him to be ends up setting himself up for disappointments. (This clearly influenced my minimal sexual past and my behaviors toward women: my empathy for them was staunch due to the victimization my mother portrayed during her messy divorce and depression. It is complicated, but not that much….) I have definitely benefitted from my new bonds and the camaraderie of those theretofore have been revitalized, too; including that with my father. I feel awesome about this. It has allowed me to view myself and women much more healthily.


       There are plenty of things I have not listed. Everything provided in this massive body of text ought to leave you with the impression that r/NoFap has made a positive difference that I could not have predicted when I first claimed my badge. I have not tested to see if my ED is no more, but that is an afterthought right now. Most importantly, I hope I convinced those on the fence—those coming from the same dark and parasitic pornographic hole I have—about whether to commit themselves to a life of fapping or of no-fapping…. Realize that only your self and your mind will push you toward this curious voyage. Your body will not. My body pleads for a menthol Pall Mall, a smooth vanilla/banana milkshake, an invasive erection, and hi-res tube porn—all at once! My mind knows that these things get in the way of my ultimate happiness. Do not yield to temptation; do not be primitive. Rise.
       I am beyond thankful for r/NoFap. I am so proud to see humans coming together on reddit and the internet for improving the self and others. **It is the strength and mission of you all that has reinforced my steadfast dedication to the constant bettering of my self.** I am looking forward to what the next 90 days brings, and the next 90 days, etc. I know with utmost certainty that I will never reset my badge.

You have clicked on this post for the first time, or have returned to it because you have a strong urge to fap right now. **Please, don't do it. Avoid doing damage to your brain through porn and avoid resetting your progress.** If, however, you ignore this advice, then confirm that what you are going to do next is this:


**Go to your favourite porn website to look at people having sex because you aren't.** You have decided that you will go and toss off a dude (yourself) over fake imagery of people getting sex because you can't get it. Hell, it's not because you can't, it's simply because you *won't*. You would rather prefer sitting alone in your room, rubbing a dick over some coloured pixels on your screen. You may also output bullshit excuses like ""It's natural. Masturbation is not bad because it's natural."" Yeah, it is natural. You are just doing a job your primal self is designed for. A job of *impregnating a computer screen.*


Now, you get to your favourite porn site. You open your favourites, whatever they may be, and you go hard just thinking about them while the webpages load. Or maybe not. Maybe it would take a while to raise your staff of life because you suffer from ED - **the main reason you joined NoFap.** Well, why the fuck are you resetting your progress then? Why would you prefer to spend 10, 20, 30 minutes, or hell, a whole hour working a guy's shaft over pixels, rather than waiting until tomorrow and reaping the benefits of increased self control and being a step closer to curing your ED? *Why? Seriously, why?*


Go ahead and ask yourself, wait, no, first look at your badge - a sign of how far you've gotten, and then ask yourself ""Is it worth it?"". Is it worth wasting time that you could have spent getting closer to achieving your goals just to fuck up your brain and feel good for 3 seconds, only to spend 5 minutes clearing it all up and being upset for the rest of the day that you've fapped, removing days, weeks, or maybe months of progress. Again. Is it? **Is it worth it?**


Now, you may also think it's ok to fap today because you're on day 2 - a long way from 90. Well, here's something to think about -


If you don't fap today, you will be on day 3 tomorrow.


Don't look as to how far you've got to go. Look at how far you've gotten. You don't have to abstain from fapping for another 88 days.*You've only got to abstain for today.* Tell yourself that everyday when you get the urge. Rome wasn't built in a day.

Everything I've ever regretted in my life stemmed from boredom. Because the things I do out of boredom are never productive. They're always the cheap thrills, easy satisfaction, the plague in our society.

To defeat boredom, we have to stop feeding it, stop rewarding our brain for making us feel that way with a dopamine rush.

And that's why meditation works. It teaches you to relax, to become ""bored"" on purpose. It is the skill of learning to enjoy boring times.

I find some posts here hard to believe. At least in my reality it is quite difficult for a man to land a woman, let alone an attractive one. It's a rare accomplishment in life and it always requires effort and hard work. This is true even for confident men without any addiction. And at least in my experience it almost never happens that a woman would throw herself at a man.

Now, in so many posts here, fapstronauts claim that they could easily pick up any girl they want. These men would go to a club or a grocery store and stunning super hot girls start giving them ""the look"". Some girls would even come over to them and want sex. For these lucky guys the only challenge would be to stay strong, and not let all the hot women that throw themselves on them every day have their way with them.

Reading these stories i scratch my head, thinking ""What's going on here? What's the name of the planet where these guys live?"". The superpowers of nofapping cannot really be the explanation here, for these guys also describe themselves as always having been a womanizer. Furthermore most of the comments under these amazing stories fully agree and say something like ""Very inspiring! I can so relate!"".

How can that be? Are so many men here professional underwear male models or something similar? Personally i cannot at all relate to many of the success stories told here. These seem to me to be completely out of this world. Honestly, reading them i often feel quite discouraged. I would think ""what's wrong with me?"" and that i must be seriously ugly (though i know that i'm not). And sometimes a dangerous conclusion sneaks into my mind, telling me:

""You will never be successful with real women. These things are not for you, you are not attractive enough. Just go back to your porn and fap, it's the best you can ever have. There's nothing to win for you.""

Now don't get me wrong. I know that we are all different, and i don't want to criticize people for sharing their personal experiences here. I also know that i should not compare myself to others. I know this thinking is wrong, but i can't help it. It's often quite frustrating, seeing so many other men here being successfull with women on a level far beyond of everything i could ever hope to reach.

I'm really not sure what to think about this. I am confused. I'm i unattractive? Are me and my buddies completely nonrepresentative? Or is my view distorted? Or are people here just exaggerating? Or what else? I really don't know and i think this is a major sticking point for me. I wonder whether i'm alone with this confusion or if other nofappers can relate.

Three days ago I give into an urge and look at some porn, edge a little bit but stop after a few minutes. This happens at moments for the next two days - I feel the dopamine rush and I am about to explode but I hold back, because ""I can get away with edging"".

I have messaged badgebot and requested a reset, I don't care if two weeks is the longest I have went without an orgasm since discovering fapping nearly a decade ago. I have to be honest with myself and let me tell you: I will carry on with this new streak with more confidence and determination than ever before.

I will not allow myself to have an orgasm just because I am reseting my badge. I know I am weak but I can be stronger and allowing myself to have an orgasm will not make me stronger.

Break this chain of laziness immediately, because this is why you relapse most of the time.

Some days you'll wake up very early, and you won't have anything to do. You'll just end up lying in bed, staring at the ceiling. An endless stream of thoughts will flow through your mind. Your thoughts will drift from how to use your spare time, to some hot girl you remember from high school, and slowly but surely you'll start to feel the urge to fap.

One half of your mind is screaming at you to shut the laptop, and the other coaxingly tells you that you won't break your streak, and that you'll just be reading through the news.

Everyone knows which half wins that battle. My point though?

You HAVE TO KEEP MOVING. Don't leave your day unplanned, make sure you constantly have something to do. That way, not only will you be less likely to fap, you will feel accomplished and you will actually start to notice the benefits of Nofap everyone talks about happen to you.

To start off I've had massive social anxiety since I can remember. I always fought it, but it was me always basically faking it.

What I am noticing now is a massive change in my ability to interact with people. Most noticeably eye contact... I'd read this on yourbrainonporn, but its like night and day. Starting a few days ago I just started making eye contact with almost everyone and it felt natural. I wanted to, rather than what I've done my entire adult life which was either force it, or start it and look away assuming I was doing something embarrassing or wrong. Now I suddenly just don't give a shit.

Its not perfect though, I can still feel the blocks in my head hit after a second or so, but more often than not I just naturally say ""no I won't stop"" and go on until its natural conclusion. This is with guys and girls just normal human interaction

Beyond that when I was riding my bike yesterday, I was passing people and saying hello. I still couldn't naturally/easily smile as well but I feel like I almost wanted to. I was smiling at things I haven't been able to smile at forever, like a guy playing with his dog, or a little happy baby in her carriage. It was just a feeling of... almost euphoria.

And beyond that I was looking at girls passing by me without fear... making eye contact and holding it *almost* long enough. Even flirted with a girl at the cash register and got her to give me an interested smile.

Its nothing short of un-fucking-believable.

I'm mean I am still not there yet... I have morning wood every couple of days or so (still a huge improvement) and its not as good as I remember, but that just means I need more time.

So for everyone else doubting themselves... the rewiring is not linear, it can happen in stages, it can take longer than 90 days, you can't tell. But its real I encourage everyone to stick with it.

Also if anyone else has similar drastic changes they want to talk about, please reply. I'd like to hear them to see how much further this will go.

Ideally even though I'll probably always be an introvert, I can see myself now being more comfortable in a big group. The only thing I still need to figure out how to fix is my inability to come up with small talk... I just don't think of that sort of thing.

Recently I've been feeling really down and stressed with family issues and MCAT studying/work. I've been thinking a lot about the fact that I'm a virgin and how much stress it's caused me in the past.

In college, a girl pretty much laughed in my face and made me really self-conscious about being a virgin. Since then, I used PMO as a coping mechanism and didn't want to get hurt the same way again. I was absolutely devastated.

But now that I've graduated, I'm living at home right now and spending time with family, I'm starting to realize that when it's time, it'll happen. A couple of my friends sleep around a lot, and they've actually got some pretty embarassing STDs, and one actually almost slept with a girl who had genital herpes but he ultimately decided not to (i'm so glad he did..or didn't rather).

The extreme is a co-worker of mine had unprotected sex at 18, and he now has a 5 year old daughter (he's 23). I woke up this morning thinking it really isn't and shouldn't be a big deal. It's only a big deal if you let it be. end /rant

EDIT: Wow, this really took off! To set the record straight, I am not just sitting back and twiddling my thumbs hoping that a girl will magically fall in my lap and I lose my virginity. Nor am I scared or chastising people who are currently having sex. Good for you! I am merely stating a couple instances where I thought, wow, being a virgin isn't so bad. It could definitely be worse sometimes! 

To those also telling me that NoFap is not working for me...in the past 122 days, I've gone from not being able to jog for 20 minutes straight to running for a full hour, approaching several cute girls (even a model!) and telling them I thought they were pretty, and have more willpower and dedication than I ever thought possible.

Currently I'm preparing for the MCAT, a US standardized beastly test to get into medical school. I don't have time outside of work, research and studying to have a girlfriend right now. And you know what? I'm okay with that. I know it'll come because there will be a time for that and I'll make it happen, just like I'm making positive strides in my life now. Thank you all for the support and kind words. You all inspire me too! :)

My wife is an intelligent, loving, and generally awesome person. I'm lucky to have her. That said, she's never been addicted to anything in her life and has generally succeeded at everything she's done on the highest levels, so her expectations for herself and the people she surrounds herself with, including myself, are very high.

For this reason I was really hesitant telling her, cause I thought she'd beat me up about it (verbally/emotionally). This was NOT the case, quite the opposite. We watched YBOP and TEDx together. It was good.

The last 2 days have been freaking spectacular. I wake up and have nothing to hide. We've had fan-freaking-tastic sex the last 2 nights. She helped me set up k9 on our computers without being a 'parent' about it, she just wanted to help.

Each morning she also has sent 'ideas' of things I can do to keep myself from relapsing/ get away from the computer. These are less of a 'honeydo' list and more of an 'i want to help' list. It is great because I can directly benefit myself and my wife and our relationship instead of fapping. 

Telling her has opened up a level of communication I didn't think I'd have, at least this early in our marriage. We can talk more comfortably. Monday and Tuesday we woke up at 6 and took the dog for a long walk at a nearby park, in the dark, the sun rising by the end. It was great, cause we just got to focus on each other, talk about us, and be honest with each other, and enjoy the beauty of a sunrise.

Lastly, my wife has told me she respects me as a man for doing what I'm doing. This seems to be a result of her realizing (through YBOP and TEDx) how ubiquitous PMO is among men. Her respect is empowering, and it feels so damn good. She is looking forward to the benefits many have realized from NoFap, and I know that she'll let me know when she sees the signs. That feedback will be excellent, I already know.

If you're married or in a committed relationship, at least consider the possibility of bringing your significant other in on NoFap. I thought it'd go so bad, but it went so, SO good. NoFap is actually easier and I feel supported by more than just a great group of people online here, but also the most important person in my life. It is awesome.

When meditating, and a fantasy disrupts your focus, you should not try to push it out of your head.  Trying to push unwanted thoughts and feelings out of your mind is often like trying to push a beach ball under water - it pops back up more noticeably than ever.

Not that you should feed your fantasies either, prolonging them intentionally.  The fact of the matter is both feeding your fantasies and pushing them away are both making a critical mistake - engaging.  Engaging with thoughts and emotions, negatively or positively, even with good intentions, often ends up making them more frequent in your day to day life.

And don't take responsibility for fantasies! No matter where you stand on the question of human free will, having thoughts from your subconcious being thrown into concious experience is in no way a voluntary action.  Examine them as they occur with as little judgement as possible, like you've just seen it on a TV screen somewhere while you were out walking in the city.  Have faith that they will decrease over time when you don't engage with them, because if you don't judge you don't give them power, and if you don't give them power then your mind lets them slip away - why would they stick around if they have no purpose?

Take accountability for touching your genitals inappropriately and for intentionally seeking out pornography - and be damn proud of yourself when you resist!  Stopping yourself mid porn search, or taking your hands out of your underwear are positive steps that deserve appreciation.",,False,,t5_2skrn,1364088761.0,,month4,True,t3_1av8eo,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1av8eo/dont_fight_your_fantasies/,

The journey has been beautiful.  The grass is greener, the sun shines brighter, my voice resonates, my body stands with confidence, my skin glows, a whole new demeanor and aura has graced me now.  It's not just the feelings, it's also being told you are a completely new person.  

I have been tappering off PMO for the past year, using it less and less, and I believe 72 is now my longest streak for the past year.  It's more than just a long streak, I feel the core of who I am inside has fundamentally changed.  I don't believe the journey ever ends, but seeing such progress and such change at times makes me feel euphoric.  I have a recurring feeling as if shackles have been removed from my wrists and ball-and-chains removed from my ankles, as if I have been a prisoner to PMO my entire life, believing its lies.  Quitting has definitely been the hardest thing I have ever done in my life, but it has also, by far, been the most rewarding.

My story is similair to a lot of guys here.  Inside I feel as though I always knew something was wrong with fapping, but could never put my finger on why, nor had the support or courage within to challenge it and defeat it.  The most productive time of my life was when I was 19 (I'm 26 now) and my girlfriend broke up with me; I only fapped once or twice for an entire year because I was very depressed because my feelings for her ran so deep, the thought of fapping saddened me because I didn't want to think of her.  This reddit didn't exist then, and google searches on ""why not to masturbate,"" left me all alone (like many of you in those dark ages of nofap) in my intuition that fapping was having serious negative effects on my psyche.  I never could articulate why fapping was so bad, and would always justify PMO (mostly to softcore stuff), but the negative psychological effects were rather profound.  Walking around as a shell of a human being, unable to hold eye contact, unable to look at people's faces for more than 2 seconds without having porn flashbacks was a scary time and I am so thankful to have crawled my way out of the hell that is PMO, inch by inch.

My only fear is relapsing in a time of sadness, time of defeat, time of stress, time of tiredness, or any other triggers.  The fear is a necessary reminder how much I went through to get to where I am.  The addiction ran so deep I can remember squeezing the side of my stomach as hard as I could as I sat and endured the urge to fap, I can remember making a 100 sticky notes all over my desk each with a reason why not to PMO, I can remember devling as deep as I could into an MMORPG with the primary purpose to escape life and run from my addiction.  Now it's much easier as I think my brain has fundamentally changed and the neural pathways for PMO have been very weakened, success is breeding success. 

Fellow fapstonauts, we are at the dawn of a new era, we are the pioneers and the champions of our generation.  We stand against many, we stand against our sheep-like fapping society, we stand against porn and all its lies, though we may falter... champions are forged through the fire of trials.  We get up and try that one last time to the bitter end with the hope that there is a light at end of the tunnel as the darkest hour is just before the dawn.  

Thank you everyone, for being my rock, being my support, and helping me every night as I read your success stories, your struggles, your failures, and witnessing the resolve to form a better-you.

Why can I attribute this directly because of nofap? Here's why:

It was Saturday night, I was kinda lonely. And in the past I woulda set a date with porn, fapped 2 or 3 times, and called it a night.

Since porn and fapping wasn't an option, I needed to do something and channel my energy in another way. I was forced to make plans with other people. I went out, socialized and had fun.

I met a hot girl, and after a night of flirting, she asked me if I wanted to come back to her place.

In the past, I might have gotten nervous and thought ""It might be easier if I just go home and fap""

But since this wasn't an option, I was forced to be adventurous and get out of my comfort zone. I went back to her place and had (good) sex with her- came twice total, and made her cum 3 or 4 times. Let me tell you, as someone with confidence issues with women, this was a huge victory for me. Again, this can be directly attributed to nofap.

What will I do now? I won't fap, and I won't watch porn. The rules still apply even though I had success on one night. From now on, this will be a permanent habit.

I tried everything managing to delay for 15 mins but it persisted if not got stronger and that's it i was sure i was going to give in but then it clicked... i realised that the urge was for sex with a girl not for fapping to a computer screen. 

It seems so simple but everything was clear to then, the urge to go turn on the laptop stopped because i didn't want that, what i wanted was real meaningful physical interaction with another human being, and because that wasn't realistically going to happen in the next hour i was able to settle down and even when i thought about fapping a little later it seemed so strange and abnormal why would i want to rub my dick while staring at a mechanical object! i was almost disgusted at the idea. 

Don't settle for fapping don't settle for anything less than a real, warm, actual person you can embrace! next time you feel that urge to fap immediately identify it as the urge to have sex then you will either get off your arse and get some real sex or you will sit your arse back down and carry on what you were doing! 

To really succeed at no fap in the long run we don't need small techniques and tips that may or may not momentarily reduce your urge to fap we need a PARADIGM SHIFT, a change in MENTALITY, all successful fapstronauts have that in common if you don't have that your doomed to the vicious relapse-reset cycle no amount of superficial techniques will help you go the distance.

Got up, read the Bible, did push-ups, family woke up, got myself to work, all is good now.  Just one more thought taken captive, one more temptation defeated.  That's how you do it, one at a time.

Funny in hindsight, not so funny at the time.

Thought I'd had a fap session before work (was on a late shift).
Loaded porn on my iMac *(side note: I fap standing up, right hand holding my penis, left handing controlling the mouse, tissue paper placed on my desk - for the sperm)*.

What I anticipated as being a quick session had now become a 1 hour affair. I started feeling a numbing/tingling sensation in my right leg, during the 1 hour I had constantly 'edged' but hadn't ejaculated, all-of-a-fucking-sudden my leg gives way and I collapse on the floor, big bang, I hear my brother walking upstairs, I'm thinking ""*shit, this is going to be awkward*"", so I attempt to get up to hide the 20+ tabs of porn I have open, and also to cover my decency, again I fucking fall, my right leg unable to support me (due to pins and needles).

So I lay there for a minute, hoping my brother doesn't come downstairs, eventually I managed to pull my self up, I immediately closed the browser and shut my iMac down.

Right then, as I laid on the floor awaiting for the affects of pins and needles to subside by easing the pressure of my leg to allow my blood supply to return, I asked myself - ""*what the fuck am I doing*""?
I've just spent 1hour masturbating to the point where I fell down due to pins and needles, and I ended up being 20 minutes late to work (I actually woke up early so I could fap before work - I know ridiculous right?).

So yeah, I realized that my addiction has become too much, from today I'm starting the 90 day of NoFap challenge.

My journey is complete.,TheFapLog,171,18,59,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/1fweh5/day_365_my_journey_is_complete/,"When I started this whole thing one year ago, I had no idea I would make it to where I am today. Day 365, 1 year, is complete. It is no longer a desire I must overcome to not masturbate; it is simply a decision of, ""nah, I don't want to,"" and that's that. It is odd that, out of all people, your own self is the hardest to control, but it is truly something to be proud of when you finally have that grasp over yourself. 

I don't think about masturbation or porn anymore on a daily basis; it has been replaced with other things in my life that are much more important. In fact, I haven't been on this subreddit, let alone Reddit, in a few months. I no longer have to battle the thoughts of ""am I going to watch porn and masturbate today?"" That is a battle I won long ago. When I think of porn, I think of how disgustingly and wrongly it portrays sex, and the relationship between man and woman in general. I no longer think of women as sexual objects--I have many female friends who I appreciate not for their physical or sexual traits, but rather for their amazing personalities. Aside from that, I have seen great success in other areas of my life--This past semester, I had the highest grades I've ever had throughout high school (I'm going to be a senior), and I achieved SAT and ACT scores that far exceeded the expectations of myself and my parents (2210/34 SAT/ACT).

I plan on continuing this streak. It would be nice to go for 2 years. For those who are just starting out, keep on trying. It is by no means easy, and it can be hard to realize this in the long-term sense, but the results you have yet to yield will be truly incredible, and brief periods of superficial gratification will only serve to continue to restrict you from achieving this sense of REAL gratification. This year, I have learned so much about who I am and what I believe, and that extends far beyond the realms of this no-fap business. It would not be an exaggeration to say that this past year has been the most important year of my life. Stay awesome, fapstronauts, and keep at it. It's worth it in the end...I can finally say that from personal experience.

1361295779.0,154,self.NoFap,18ttvu,"NoFap is Incredible, Absolutely Life Changing",,179,25,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/18ttvu/nofap_is_incredible_absolutely_life_changing/,"Today is my last day on NoFap, after all we have to move on some time.  I love this community, and I am going to miss you, but the wise know when it's time to move on + Reddit takes up too much of my time.

I have been porn-free for close to 150 days,  I've fapped 3 times since then, due to incredibly logical reasons and not due to temptation (long story) and I'm nowhere close to going back.

I want to address this to the all fapstronauts who are focusing on getting women.

###A. NoFap + Focus on Women = Frustration &amp; possible relapse.###

1.) When you sit there and drool over every pretty woman, wishing you could be with them, you are still feeding a different process, which is rewarding your brain (albeit not as intense as porn), and it tells you that being a spectator, muttering to yourself *""Mmm...dat ass is fantastic, I would tap that all day, everyday""*, and not approaching her - is more rewarding than actually approaching her.
 
2.) You look for the validation of women to make eye contact with you; or give you a sign that they see you as attractive,  Most women don't do this anyways, so your confidence is going to plummet.

3.) You end up losing focusing, getting off-track and get angry when women come easily to other guys; making you feel that you aren't worthy for one

4.) Then you Fap and/or watch porn, fantasizing over women who do ridiculous things in ridiculous situations that will never happen, which will make you more disinterested in real women.

5.) You're back to square one.

###B. So How Am I Suppose to Attract Women Without focusing on it?###
-  There is a surplus of guys with sex drive.
-  There is a surplus of guys who can suppress that sex energy with porn.
-  There is a surplus of guys who can express that sex energy with staring at women all day and fapping when they get home.
-  There is an extreme **shortage** of men who can express that sexual energy in a positive manner.

###C. So What Are You Telling Me To Do?###

Read This:
[Think and Grow Rich - Napoleon Hill] (http://www.sacred-texts.com/nth/tgr/tgr16.htm)

###D.  The Benefits of Controlling Your Sexual Energy###

1.) Apply it to exercising, if you make exercising a challenge everyday, then NoFap will never get old; because every single day you will feel like you've accomplished something.

2.) That same persistence that you had when you spent hours to find the PERFECT video to get off to in porn?  Remember that?  That persistence will be everywhere in your life.  You'll be productive for hours upon hours on end without even knowing it, contrast to those wasted days you watched pretty much the whole day and felt like shit because you don't know where the time went.

3.) You will stop focusing on women, and because of this, for some strange reason women love the aloof guy; they'll flock to you.  It's happened to me, but I don't care.  In fact, when a woman asks for my number, I get kind of annoyed now.  Mostly because, I have the confidence to approach her, if I didn't, then there's a reason. (sorry to sound like a douche)

4.) Your personality will be magnetic, like that one guy that you know, that people just seem to gravitate to and want to be in his ""circle"".  That's because he's most likely mastered Sexual Transmutation usually without knowing it.

5.) When you do find that one beautiful woman that does catch your eye.  Something will happen; it will be second nature, your feet will move and you will approach her.  You will get her number, and you will be expecting her to say yes.  I have never approached a woman with confidence before, **in my life**, until I focused my sexual energy on self improvement.

###E.  Legitimate Arguments Against This###
- *Men are hunters, we have to hunt for women* - I understand this side, but if you look at it, men are also meant to attract women by showing off their status. etc.

- *You can't get girls unless you focus on them and be aggressive* - This is a legitimate argument, the early bird gets the worm, and girls like men with confidence, etc; but there's a certain way to do it, have you ever met those ghetto dudes (of every race, mind you) who holler at women from across the street?  ""AY MA! LEMME GET YO NUMBAH!"" - Has never worked once.

And there's probably more, they are legitimate, but just apply this to your life immediately.  It won't be immediate, NoFap and Sexual Transmutation is a snowball effect, but eventually you'll see huge improvements in many aspects of your life.

Thank you guys, it's been an honor, hopefully this subreddit gets more subscribers than r/gonewild one day :p, goodbye.



**TL;DR - Stop focusing on sex.**",,False,,t5_2skrn,1361296223.0,,,True,t3_18ttvu,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/18ttvu/nofap_is_incredible_absolutely_life_changing/,
1354446353.0,155,self.NoFap,145b83,90 days completed. Here's my story,MyNoFap,179,24,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/145b83/90_days_completed_heres_my_story/,"First of all a quick backstory. Mastrubater since I was a 12 year old kid. It kinda started when I saw an erotic CD of my father. Since then it kind of got out of hand. At age 20 I barely had any social contacts anymore, was PMOing at least 5 times a day and my grades were shit. One day I saw a link of YBOP and I knew what the problem was: porn had taken over. You see, porn has become so accepted into our society, that it's become strange not to watch porn. It has become associated with manliness and coming of age, since every male that has hit puberty now watches porn. I myself thought that it was due to an increased libido that I watched so much porn, now I know I was wrong. I had an addiction. My social life was a wreck, I barely went out and most certainly didn't have any female contacts.




The first few days are hard in their own way. You become steadily more horny every day untill you hit about 2 weeks (at this point I was at my best mood, I felt like I owned the world). I wish that feeling after 2 weeks was permanent, that felt fucking amazing. I feel less confident now but more in control. Then the flat line began. This part of your trip sucks the most. Finally you reach a point that you feel completely in control. 




Needless to say, if you stop browsing pornographic websites for hours per day, you'll have more spare time. So here is a list of this that I did with my spare time:

-School, first thing I 'fixed' were my grades for medschool. From a 53% average to a 73% average. Yes kids, learning for your tests work. 

-Started playing piano, I stopped when I was 14 year old and never picked it up again, untill now. I almost got für elise down after 2 months or so. Yet again, practise makes perfect. I might be looking into lessons in the future, since I know I barely can improve on my own now.

-Reading. This opens a new world to anyone. There's just so much to learn from books. Currently I am reading the great Gatsby and the book of five rings by Miyamoto Musashi (I would recommend this to anybody who does martial arts).

-Lifting weights. Great way to relax and chill with bros. I already did some karate before, so I hope this will make me a better karateka.

-Homebrewing. I make my own booze from apples. Shit is good man.

-Being a test subject for science. That's how I earn my moneys.

-Knitting. Difficult to start with and very monotonous. I still suck at this but one day I will make my own flag/clothing piece.

-Having my social life back. I started going outside my house again.




Before NoFap I was a kissless-virgin who didn't have any female contact whatsoever. During my stay here, I made out with 2 girls, so that's a large improvement. I also fingered some lady, still a virgin though. This all is kinda weird, because I am still oblivious when it's about women. People tell me often enough that I am attractive and that some girls are really into me. I am just not picking up the signals. That doesn't bother me that much anymore. Life is just way too awesome to be worried about the petty things. 




And maybe the best thing that has changed for me. People start to respect me. I am talking about strangers, friends and collegues. I've become one of the gym's regulars now and people are impressed with what I lift (I am used to being the skinniest guy everywhere I go, this is a new feeling). Friends are looking up to me, because I've become so much more daring when it comes to women and everything. My dad (mr. so-you-climbed-mount-everest-pussy-I-climbed-the-everest-without-ropes-and-oxygen) is proud that I finally took control over my life and has started complimenting my achievements. A little side note, he rarely gives compliments to anybody, if he says you are good then you are good. He knows something is up. My grades are higher than those of my friends at school (not yet one of the best, but they will be one day), and they are impressed by my wits. This is a new weird feeling. I never had this before, I was that average guy.




If you ask me now if I am cured, I would answer no. I defeated MO for 90 days, but I still crave P on a daily basis. During my 90 day period I still watched porn now and then, didn't edge though. My next step will be becoming completely free from porn.




You guys are the best, great community. I know my life would be way worse if I'd never heard about you guys. This is one of the hardest things I have ever done, I know I couldn't have done it without you guys.  Thanks. 




tl;dr Do NoFap, stick with it, you are awesome.
