It's gotten me through some rough times.**

Two traveling monks reached a town where there was a young woman waiting to step out of her sedan chair. The rains had made deep puddles and she couldn't step across without spoiling her silken robes. She stood there, looking very cross and impatient. She was scolding her attendants. They had nowhere to place the packages they held for her, so they couldn't help her across the puddle.

The younger monk noticed the woman, said nothing, and walked by. The older monk quickly picked her up and put her on his back, transported her across the water, and put her down on the other side. She didn't thank the older monk, she just shoved him out of the way and departed.

As they continued on their way, the young monk was brooding and preoccupied. After several hours, unable to hold his silence, he spoke out. “That woman back there was very selfish and rude, but you picked her up on your back and carried her! Then she didn't even thank you!”

“I set the woman down hours ago,” the older monk replied. “Why are *you* still carrying her?”",,False,,t5_2qlm4,False,,,True,t3_1f4wn9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits/comments/1f4wn9/a_story_about_unloading_your_burdens/,

###“Letting the water clear”

Let the solution show itself. Acting too early just muddies the water.  

  
###“Filling the bowl”

Accept what comes, but take too much and the bowl will spill.  


###“Sharpen the saw”

###“Know the utensil, keep to the blocks”

Know what the situation is, but realize that it is also what you make of it.  


###“Embodying the light”

Accept everyone, and use every situation.  


###“Two feet on the ground”

You are most stable when you don’t climb the ladder.

And this process of watching is the very alchemy of real religion. Because as you become more and more deeply rooted in witnessing, thoughts start disappearing. You are, but the mind is utterly empty.

I've always had difficulty connecting to people, in one way or another. Not because I don't try, but because the type of interactions I am constantly searching for are few and far between and incredibly rare. Despite my efforts, I am profoundly opposed to simple, small talk and the cyclical patterns of ups and downs that I watch most relationships suffer from. It seems to me that, although people claim they want to find their 'soul mate' or their 'best friend,' what most people are looking for is someone to give voice to their inner silence so they can avoid having to answer life's big questions. Why seek something greater if you have others around to occupy you? To me, this is the easy way to coast through your life, no real responsibility to anyone or anything - but always just a consenting participant. One of the masses. I am completely unable to relate to this mentality in so, so many others. They have to be aware that the people they spend their time on feel just the same way about them, right? Lukewarm. 

I first became aware of this when I was about 11. I have a childhood friend that lives her life this way, still to this day. She is fantastic fun and I always have a good time when I spend time with her, but each interaction is always so clearly guarded by strict lines that are not to be crossed. Namely, no expectations can be had at any point. And I don't even mean the expectation that she would be there in an emergency, I mean like...nothing - not even plans for later in the evening. She always operates on an ""Only if it's perfect for me,"" mentality. And yet the expectation on her friends from her is considerable. It seems to be how these types of things work. And yet somehow, she seems happy...at least outwardly.

Although this friend is an example, she is by no means the only person in my life that operates in this fashion. Everyone in the world has different degrees of themselves that they are willing to share with the world, and each of those comes with a different level of expectation from others. The consistency and 'responsibility' in a relationship of any kind is what makes it worth while. Through an unspoken promise we make to our friends and lovers that we will be there for them, we are able to create a safe environment where we have the blessing of learning about one another, and perhaps more importantly, learn from one another. It is through these relationships that we are able to discover ourselves and learn who we are, how we feel about the world, and so many other profoundly important things. But what happens when no one is willing to put in the time and effort required to achieve this? What then happens to the world?

It's an absurd phenomenon to me because it's truly very ironic. How often do we hear others complain about how no one is listening, or how they just want to find that perfect love? The reality is that you are going to get what you give as far as relationships are concerned. This is not to say that people will not disappoint you. What I mean is, if you are not actually wanting to connect to the person you are spending your time with, how can you expect them to do the same for you? Take a minute to think about your best relationship for just a minute...what separates it from the rest? Is it because you grew up together and don't know anything else? Is it a sibling that has always been there? Is it that person you met on the first day at a new school? Is it your new roommate that you found on the internet and call your best friend because of proximity? Why is this person special to you? For me, what separates the people I value apart from everyone else is the connection I am able to make to them. 

There is a quote that goes something like this:

Simple minds discuss others.


Average minds discuss events.


Great minds discuss ideas. 

I like to think about this when I am observing relationships around me. People seem to thrive on negativity. The existence of this negativity is the basis of their relationship and probably the only real reason that they have anything to say to one another. This overflows in to every facet of this relationship. The people they hate, the things they hate, the line is too long, the server is too slow, the weather sucks, that person did this to me once, et cetera. And then something I find to be extremely strange occurs: they do this to each other. Now, suddenly a group of friends forms and is made up of people who are each saying negative things about the others, consistently. And they know this is happening! Do any of them really like one another? And how do they come up with so many 'small talk' things to say? I just can not for the life of me understand what these types of people are gaining from one another except the lack of outward loneliness. But maybe that's all they're seeking...

What I've Learned:

People do not really care about you. They might seem that they do for a glimmer of time, but when you get to the core of the relationship - it's always about what they can get out of it. People are seeking others to fill their spare time, but they do not actually perceive you as a real person. This begs the age-old question of whether altruism is or is not real. My theory is that everything we do is a show for others in one way or another. The clothes we wear, the job we have; everything is all to create a very specific image of what we want to project to the world. This is no different when it comes to 'good deeds' we do for others. This is the exact thing that makes charities so successful. People love to show off all the good they've done for the world. But what about the people that do silent good deeds that no one ever hears about? This still makes that person feel that they are a better person for what they did. Maybe they did want to do something nice for someone else, but only because they like the way it makes them feel. This is not altruism, it's narcissism. I like to believe it exists out there somewhere in chosen special people. I'll even say that I believe myself to be one of those people, because one of my life's callings is to connect to others, and to help them learn to do so in return. But I can't be the judge of that. Truly, that's why a real friend is not only important, but imperative - friendship provides perspective, and it makes you a better person. 

We sort of live in an age of 'whoever cares the least has the most power,' in relationships. Technology and social media certainly have their roles in this mentality, but truly it's more profound than that. In life, we are given the capacity to think and process ideas, concepts, and emotions. It is our quest to learn to connect to the world around us and our responsibility to ourselves not to let the fear of what we might discover cripple us. This is why we are designed to respond to community. We genuinely need others to help us along this path, to support us, guide us, and love us - just as we do for them. Unfortunately, it has become the norm to let this fear prevent us from really seeking what would satisfy us. True companionship. No limits. No barriers. No rules. Just raw love. Just as you would do anything for whatever you think is the most important thing in your life, it is my sincere hope that you can learn to bring that in to your friendships, too. What is so scary about letting someone really see you? 

So, if you're really lucky, you will find at least one person who really loves you. Without conditions. This means that this person will love you no matter what happens, no matter how difficult. You are forever bonded by your love for each other and the loyalty that stems from that is unbreakable. While up to this point I've only been able to find that with my family, it is my passionate hope that it is possible for this love to exist out of the dynamic of your nuclear family system. I see no reason you can't love someone unconditionally that wasn't born right next to you. Maybe love is taught. Maybe it is felt. And maybe if you don't have an example of this kind of love in your foundation, you are unable to experience it. Whatever the reason may be, I wish you all the gift of an unconditional relationship with another. But I urge you to be the type of person that gives this love in return. If we can truly accomplish this, we could change the world - one relationship at a time.

I am glad I did because yesterday was one the more unlucky days in my life but it didn’t fell bad being in the middle of uncertainty. I was driving home from a concert, and I got the closest I’ve been to death in my 28 year young life. 

Someone died that day, it wasn’t me, (well maybe it was the old me), it wasn’t the passenger in the car but a deer. (poor deer is probably still lying on the concrete with a licence plate in his gut). I feel sorry for the deer, yes but I am happy to be alive. 

Anyway what this taught me, or what Zen habit taught me was, that I had to be present in the moment, there was nothing I could do about the poor deer, there was nothing I could do about the car not working any more. 
So here I am 100 miles away from home, with no money, not a working car, low cellphone battery. 
2 months from now I would have freaked out, I would have been crying, not knowing what to do. But yesterday, I was calm, I was thinking rational about what I should do to fix this. I had plenty of time to think about my life. and I realised, I don’t need that car..
Yes I have a bunch of stuff to take care of now, it could be stressful but I am not worrying about it, because I can do something about it. So why would I worry about it then why would I want to create a stressful situation, when there isn’t one there to start with. 
I guess I could see this car collision as the final test, to see if I could implement all that I’ve learned from this sub-reddit and so far I am doing great.

I experimented a lot during these summer vacations on building habits that last. So here are some habits I have developed which I am most proud of.

**Habit List**

* Daily Physical Exertion : Running a few kilometres and doing 7-minute-workout , both done twice a day.

* Yoga : Doing yoga twice a day, morning and evening. ( I have this wierd technique where in I do it while watching ted talk videos, so that I don't get bored doing it, its wierd but it works. :-)

* Food Hacks : These include doing a bunch of things like, making sure I do atleast 2 litres of water everyday, consuming neem leaves in the morning, consuming a mixture of lemon and honey in the morning.


**Effect**

Doing these on a daily basis have definitely changed my life. More than anything, the first bullet i.e physical exertion has been most phenomenal. The effect of the other 2 haven't been so much profound, but I know it will show in the long term.


**Other habits I would like to develop**

* Daily meditation, right now I only do it twice a week.
* Maintaining a journal.
* Dedicating some time everyday to pure theretical computer science, as upposed to coding for money or fame.

Have you ever gotten to the point where you have scrolled through everything on reddit and all of your go to sites only to find yourself searching for more even though you know there's nothing left. Hell. I sound like a crack addict but that's how I feel when that happens. 

I'm 23 now. I've gotten better but still struggle from time to time. When I disconnect and become mindful, everything becomes clear. When I don't have a constant stream of internet stimulation, my mind is clear and I'm at ease. I'll typically resort to the crack addict internet habits when I'm stressed only to result in more stress.

Anyone else struggle with this? Hope this rambling makes sense. ",,False,,t5_2qlm4,False,,,True,t3_1g9m2l,http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits/comments/1g9m2l/does_anyone_else_struggle_with_old_habits_of/,

The truth is this subreddit has *always* been about more than just Zen. It was originally created by a dozen or so bloggers who covered various things in self-improvement: 

- Leo Babauta (Zen Habits - simplicity/meditation/productivity - hence the name of this reddit)

- Jonathan Mead (Illuminated Mind - self-improvement/business)

- Charles Gilkey (Productive Flourishing - productivity/motivation)

- Adam Baker (Man vs. Debt - personal finance)

- Jonathan Fields (JonathanFields.com - productivity/writing/entrepreneurship)

As well as a handful of other bloggers who covered stuff about happiness, relationships, health, goals, motivation, simplicity, etc.

That's why the title of this subreddit is ""Zen Habits and Self-Growth,"" to make it clear that it's not just about zen stuff.

This is kind of lame, but I felt like this was the best place to look for help. I just wanted to get some advice or feedback on this issue I have. I like someone, but I have difficulty being myself around them. I feel like the moment I see them my personality turns into a really boring, unimaginative, slightly awkward and scared person. It's not even with just people I'm attracted to, this happens with anyone I want to make a good impression on. 

I try all day long to keep myself from useless thinking, dwelling on the past, or worrying about my problems. The moment someone comes around though, I just have a little freak out without realizing it. When I'm at my calmest with people I've known for a long time I feel much more creative and witty but my charm instantly turns into this self-defeating blankness when I'm around certain or new people. The only thing that makes me, me around these people is alcohol, and I'm not about to go become a full-fledged alcoholic at this point, but I notice that I love myself when I've had a few. I want that drunken disregard for any doubts in my mind, but whilst sober. 

Am I missing something here? How can I keep myself from falling into this mental pit? (Also, I am in no way an alcoholic, I don't even drink that much)

""What can people do to be happy?""

1. ***Realizing that enduring happiness doesn't come from making it.*** People adapt to changing circumstances- even to wealth or a disability. Thus, wealth is like health: Its utter absence breeds misery, but having it (or any circumstance we long for) doesn't guarantee happiness.
2. ***Take control of your time.*** Happy People feel in control of their lives, often aided by mastering their use of time. It helps to set goals and break them into daily aims. Although we often overestimate how much we will accomplish in any given day (leaving us frustrated), we generally underestimate how much we can accomplish in a year, given just a little progress every day.
3. ***Act happy.*** We can sometimes act ourselves into a frame of mind. Manipulated into a smiling expression, people feel better; when they scowl, the whole world seems to scowl back. So put on a happy face. Talk as if you feel positive self-esteem, are optimistic, and are outgoing. Going through the motions can trigger the emotions.
4. ***Seek work and leisure that engage your skills.*** Happy people often are in a zone called ""flow"" -absorbed in a task that challenges them without overwhelming them. The most expensive forms of leisure (sitting on a yacht) often provide less flow experience than gardening, socializing, or craft work. 
5. ***Join the ""movement"" movement.*** An avalanche of research reveals that aerobic exercise not only promotes health and energy but also is an antidote for mild depression and anxiety. Sound minds reside in sound bodies. 
6. ***Give your body the sleep it wants.*** Happy people live active, vigorous lives yet reserve time for renewing sleep and solitude. Many people suffer from a sleep debt, with resulting fatigue, diminished alertness, and gloomy moods.
7. ***Give priority to close relationships.*** Intimate friendships with those who care deeply about you can help you weather difficult times. Confiding is good for soul and body. Resolve to nurture your closest relationships: to *not* take those closest to you for granted, to display to them the sort of kindness that you display to others, to affirm them, to share, and to play together. To rejuvenate your affections, resolve in such ways to *act* lovingly. 
8. ***Focus beyond the self.*** Reach out to those in need. Happiness increases helpfulness. (Those who feel good do good.) But doing good also makes one feel good.
9. ***Keep a gratitude journal.*** Those who pause each day to reflect on some positive aspect of their lives (their health, friends, family, freedom, education, senses, natural surroundings, and so on) experience heightened well-being.
10. ***Nurture your spiritual self.*** For many people, faith provides a support community, a reason to focus beyond self, and a sense of purpose and hope. Study after study finds that actively religious people are happier and that they cope better with crises.

For example, imagine you wanted to go on a road trip with your friends, but the car was too small, so one of you had to stay behind. You draw straws, and end up losing. You attribute your loss to 'bad luck', because you would rather go on the road trip. You then end up meeting your future wife that weekend because you didn't go on the road trip. Now you say that drawing the shortest straw was 'good luck'. You then have a horrible marriage, end up getting divorced, and hate your life. At this point, you say that drawing the shortest straw was, once again, 'bad luck'.

It's not a todo or a calendar, but rather a system to help getting every reoccurring task, chore and activity done - and I think it's brilliant. 

So I asked for some free app codes for Reddit and here they are: 

* ~~WAPPXX4JTJLE~~
* ~~3EXYEXXHX3NE~~
* ~~7XK3N3TXXM6W~~
* ~~AN4JXNEJALKM~~
* ~~A734JAYXFMWY~~
* ~~JL9W6EM6NTXP~~
* ~~MER9HHTAWH7R~~
* ~~RFTFMT6LWTNX~~
* ~~L3HN4ERR6FJF~~
* ~~WX3X6EK9RPL3~~

Read more about Doable here: http://getdoable.com/

Get the app: http://itunes.apple.com/app/doable/id545180165


**Edit 1:**

Hi everyone.. My friends are stoked at the comments received so they gave me another 10 app codes.. They say they'd like to give more, but apple only lets them create 50 per app version.

I told them to come here on reddit to answer your questions, so they will probably drop by soon. I know they have planned a Mac, Android and online version (with cloud sync).

Soyen Shaku, the first Zen teacher to come to America, said: 'My heart burns like fire but my eyes are as cold as dead ashes.' He made the following rules, which he practiced every day of his life.

In the morning before dressing, light incense and meditate. 

Retire at a regular hour. Partake of food at regular intervals. Eat with moderation and never to the point of satisfaction. 

Receive a guest with the same attitude you have when alone. When alone, maintain the same attitude you have in receiving guests. 

Watch what you say, and whatever you say, practice it. 

When an opportunity comes do not let it pass by, yet always think twice before acting. 

Do not regret the past. Look to the future. 

Have the fearless attitude of a hero and the loving heart of a child.

Upon retiring sleep as if you had entered your last sleep. Upon awakening, leave your bed behind you instantly as if you had cast away a pair of old shoes.

It is not personal.

are the same moments that you feel most alive.

whether it is enmired in feeling helpless, useless, rejected.

(quote from Kristen Neff),philthomson,26,3,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits/comments/12o5h7/mindfulness_and_selfcompassion_whats_the/,"'What is the difference between mindfulness and self-compassion? While it’s necessary to be mindfully aware of our suffering in order to give our selves compassion, the two constructs are not exactly the same. Mindfulness is a way relating to our internal experience. Self-compassion is a way of relating to our selves as experiencers. Mindfulness non-judgmentally accepts the thoughts, emotions and sensations that arise in present moment awareness. Compassion entails the desire for sentient beings to be happy and free from suffering. Self-compassion involves a bit of a paradox, therefore. A key slogan in the Mindful Self-Compassion program (developed with Chris Germer) is: “we give ourselves compassion not to feel better, but because we feel bad.” In other words, we must learn to fully turn toward and accept the fact that we’re in pain, otherwise we’ll make things worse by resisting what is. At the same time we can soothe and comfort ourselves for how hard it is, making things easier to bear. Mindfulness is necessary to insure that compassion doesn’t become a slick new form of resistance (""I’ll be kind to myself to make the pain go away""), while compassion provides the emotional safety needed to fully feel and open to one’s pain (“I’m sorry you’re going through this, I’m here for you.”) Thus, mindfulness and self-compassion mutually strengthen and enhance one another.'",,False,,t5_2qlm4,False,,,True,t3_12o5h7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits/comments/12o5h7/mindfulness_and_selfcompassion_whats_the/,

Some quick facts before we get started:

+ I'm a recently turned 24 year old male from New York.

+ The Emotion Machine first started in June 2009 and now has over 400+ articles on cognitive-behavioral therapy, positive psychology, mindfulness meditation, social psychology, motivation, and much more.

+ The site gets about 1,500-2,000+ visits a day.

I want to also thank /r/ZenHabits (and reddit in general) for being supportive of my articles ever since the beginning. You guys have really helped me to build the site into what it is today, and I hope it continues to grow into the future.

And as thank you to reddit, I want to offer my e-book ""The Science of Self Improvement"" for an exclusive low price, just $5.49. I've never ever dropped the price this low (and I likely never will again), but this special deal is one way I want to thank reddit for all its support.

I realized I can either play to win, or play not to lose.  That one simple shift in outlook forever altered the decisions I make.  So much so that I packed up everything and moved across the country.  

For anyone that's interested, read the story here and all my thoughts on the subject.

http://www.thechangeblog.com/play-the-game/

The take home point is this, playing ""not to lose"" will never win you the game.  The attachment to preserving what one has also leads never ending fear of loss.  

But when you put everything all on the line and let go of being attached to what is, you'll find the thrill in life that comes from being willing to go ""all in.""

It's through letting go of needing comfort and security that actually gets you more security, because you know nothing can truly phase you or cause you loss.

Advertising is all around us and lately it's just been feeling like a huge drain and burden to constantly be bombarded by bright, loud, distracting, stupifying advertising. I've been trying to watch less TV but as we well know, 1/3 or more of a block of TV programming is advertising. Advertisements are every where on the road, on the 'net, in magazines, in stores... everywhere. 

I don't want to be persuaded into buying something, spending more money on material things that I don't need. Unfortunately, millions and millions of dollars are spent by companies to convince me I need to do that. It's mental and emotional clutter and it's hard to avoid. I just want to see what you guys think about avoiding this ever-present grind and freeing my mind of this sort of thing.",,False,,t5_2qlm4,False,,,True,t3_1kg8z7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ZenHabits/comments/1kg8z7/how_can_i_avoid_the_evergrowing_burden_of/,
