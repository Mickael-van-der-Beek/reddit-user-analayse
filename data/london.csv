You saw me crying quietly, and while others pretended not to notice, you moved to sit beside me and joked that you are only doing so because the person next to you was listening to his music too loudly. You asked me how I was, tried to joke with me, and made me smile through my tears. You told me that I deserved better and that I will be stronger after this.

I have just been told I am worthless by someone whom I thought I loved. Yet you, a complete stranger whom I will never meet again, did all of that just to make me feel better. I don't even know your name, but thank you so, so much. While I can't say that I am feeling much better right now, I will always remember what you did. Thank you for having the kindness and the courage to approach someone desperately in need of a few nice words. Thank you.

I don't know why I am putting this here, but I hope that if any of you ever see someone who looks like they could use some help, please remember that a little act of kindness and concern do much more than you can ever imagine.

Dear friends,

On the 27th of December 2012 at approximately 9.45pm GMT I was the victim of a vicious attack at the Great Eastern Pub on Glenaffric Avenue, E14, Isle of Dogs in London. I was working my night job as a karaoke host when I was set upon by 6 girls in an unprovoked attack.

The injuries I sustained were severe facial and head injuries due to punching, kicking on stomping on me. I had nearly 40% of my hair ripped out from the roots. I also have sprains in both ankles and my right knee and a few of my fingers. The rest were just superficial bruises all over my body although I am suffering slightly from mild whiplash and back pain.

During the attack, no one intervened and in fact 3 people came out to watch but offered no assistance. There was however, one man, a stranger who was very drunk but quickly ran out to cover my body with his to protect me. I never got his name and no one seems to know who he is.

The ambulance never turned up and I had to drive myself to A&amp;E.

In the meantime, the police have been less than helpful first arriving 10 minutes after the criminals escaped just to be told that ‘they would have come sooner, but they were in the middle of the nightly briefing’. Since then, I have been more or less told that my case is weak and all the evidence I have turned in ‘waters down my case even more’. This includes, the CCTV footage, the full names of the criminals (as they wrote them down on their karaoke request slips), and the partial license plate number of the getaway car as well as the contact details of the driver.

So now, I am asking all of you for your help. 

I only want to give you the facts of the case and won’t go into any further medical or financial difficulties this has created but I can safely say that it has not been an easy start to 2013 for me and it just seems to continue to get worse.

Thank you for all your time and assistance. If you would be so kind to spread this around to as many people as you can, I would be eternally grateful.

PLEASE CONTACT THE LIMEHOUSE POLICE VIOLENT CRIMES UNIT IF YOU HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THIS INCIDENT - 0207﻿ 275 4759

Need advice urgently...",rippedoffinlondon,188,22,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/164bhr/ripped_off_at_a_secrets_gentlements_club_i_know/,"So to make a long story short, since I've had a pretty rough year, a few friends and I, while on a night out last saturday, decided to treat ourselves and ended up at a ""Secrets"" Gentlemen's club near Euston. I'm a student, so this is not something I normally do, but I agreed anyway. I had a few drinks, but 100% aware of what was going on.

I paid for a bill of what I believed to be £200, and an additional £50 later that night. Twice I was asked to enter my pin, but each time the merchant (I realized in retrospect) decided to skip the step where I approved the charge before entering the pin. I even recall raising this issue to the staff, when I wasn't given a receipt and at one point my card was even taken, along with ID. Needless to say, I was in shock the next morning when 2 charges of £1600+ and one of £700+ were on my account. There is no way I would approve any such transactions, since I couldn't and wouldn't ever be in a position to spend such ridiculous sums.


I called Amex today, almost certain that these would be cancelled, but as 2 of these were authorised by pin they said there was nothing they could do, and I should take it up with the merchant and Police. This is exactly what I intend to do, but I also realise my situation looks dire. The ""merchant"" (dodgy strip club) will of course deny responsibility, and claim that I did in fact rack up such extraorbitant charges, and since my approval was given by pin, this was, technically, proof of my acceptance. Needless to say I am furious, angry at myself for not paying closer attention, and downright scared what will become of this situation. It looks like I would need a lawyer eventually, but the costs associated would probably exceed those of the charges. Reddit, I know its a lot to ask, but if you have any input this would really help... (sorry if I don't respond to follow up questions immediately, I'm currently on the way to the Police station)

Thank you...

EDIT 1: Just back from the Police Station (3 hours of talking). A friendly lady cop took down all info about the night in detail, as well as filing a report. Hoping for the best. Also, thanks for all the advice so far, you guys are really great... I'll keep you updated...

EDIT 2: I contacted the Head Office which in turn e-mailed me photocopies of various receipts ""justifying"" the expenses. One of which had a GRATUITY of £150! To my shock, ALL the receipts were signed; a clear forgery of my signature by a member of staff!

The worst letting agent I have ever encountered.",glueface,167,17,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/185gvd/if_youre_looking_to_rent_in_london_stay_as_far/,"Sorry mods if you don’t allow company-bashing etc., take this down if you feel the need. I just needed  to vent on Wooster &amp; Stock.

Throughout our tenancy in Camberwell they were uncommunicative to the point where I had to visit their office and personally bring them round to view problems such as broken boilers and toilets to prove to them they needed fixing. Everything took months to process, with the onus always on the tenant to keep reminding whoever picked up the phone about issues. 

We left in September 2012, and we have only just got them to agree to return the deposit, after months of emails, calls and personal visits. The worst, though, was when our landlord (who also happens to be the Director) waived our Wear and Tear bill (£200 from a £1500 renovation) because of how long the process had taken. I then visited the flat and found it in the exact same condition as we had left it, with no renovation done, and some sense of déjà vu as I listened to the current tenant complain about the issues with the flat. He lied to my face and pretended waiving the bill was doing us a favour, when there was no bill to begin with. The only reason I settled the Deposit as it stood, (£200 cleaning bill, £250 Check In and Out Reports – also bollocks), was because we simply need the money back in order to avoid bankruptcy.

Seriously, I know basically all letting agents are ridiculous in London, but in particular avoid this one. Tenants are cashcows to Wooster &amp; Stock.

Can any Londoners help?,pinkstripeycat,161,32,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/xh0ph/all_our_things_have_been_stolen_can_any_londoners/,"My brother-in-law, new to reddit, posted this story in AskReddit but didn't get much response. I wonder if reddit londoners can pull together and help (or vote up to get this to the attention of someone who can help).

My sister and her boyfriend came back from a picnic on Thursday to find the locks had been changed on their flat. The police came and broke in for them to find the flat totally empty and two girls inside holding a contract and claiming to have lived there for three days. Basically what has happened is the landlord has stolen everything they own (including contracts etc). All they have left are their two cats who were hiding terrified under a wardrobe.

The police would not let them enter the flat and refuse to register this as a crime. The landlord has prior convictions for burglary etc. and seems to know the legal system well.

They have spoken to CAB, Shelter and a lawyer friend but it seems there is absolutely nothing they can do unless the police register this as a crime. Everyone we know has been very supportive and they have couches to stay on but what they need is proper legal advice and help from a criminal lawyer (or someone else qualified to deal with this). 

This is really urgent - they've been to the police every day for 5 days and they are desperate and have nothing. Please, if you can help or know someone who can, can you send me a private message and I'll put you in touch with them.

I fractured my arm four weeks ago, and just got the cast off (yesssssssssssssssssssss!!). Any way, I purchased a special arm sleeve which waterproofs the cast for showers etc. (Like [this](http://www.ilcnsw.asn.au/images/item_images/1254033.jpg?1365754107))

Unless you have a huge penis and are having difficulties finding suitable condoms, this sleeve has literally no other purposes. 

I'm not planning of breaking my arm again. So I just wondered whether I could pass this on to someone in need. It was amazingly helpful and 10000% better than a plastic bag, it works perfectly. I've only had if a few weeks and it is clean and in excellent condition. 

Let me know and I'll pass it on, or post it (obviously free). I live in Hackney so easy to meet central or there. 

From Mike

**EDIT**: I conclude no one in London has recently broken their arm, and therefore will put on Freecycle unless I hear otherwise. Kisses ",,False,self,t5_2qkog,1366638405.0,,,True,t3_1co887,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1co887/do_you_know_someone_who_has_recently_broken_their/,

1369054966.0,116,self.london,1eow57,Why is it so hard to make friends in London?,theonefornagging,140,24,126,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/1eow57/why_is_it_so_hard_to_make_friends_in_london/,"EDIT: I should have probably said GOOD friends, not just friends. 

I know this issue has been discussed on the subreddit before but I feel that the solutions given are superficial and don’t get to the heart of the problem. Yes, I’ve been to endless meetup groups, lessons, social clubs etc and I have a big list of acquaintances to pick from if I want to have a beer once a month (and they would like two-week notice, preferably). But I don’t have close friends, people you would call in case of emergencies, people to confide in, have fun, act silly and be yourself. And it’s not for lack of trying, trust me. 

In my opinion there are some difficulties that make it extremely hard to form meaningful friendships in London (or any other big city, for that matter): 

1)	The distances, transport links and people’s busy lives prohibit last minute and impromptu home visits or meetings, like we would do in my own country. You have to arrange almost everything well in advance, sometimes to a ridiculous extent, and when you finally get there, you exchange your news politely and then you leave early to catch the tube or train home. How can you form friendships with someone you see maybe once every two months? Or when you can’t invite someone over your place to watch a movie after a certain time because it takes them an hour to get home and staying over is unheard of? 
EDIT: This seems to have been misunderstood by many. I'm perfectly happy to travel distances and I often do. I just find that I'm the minority in that. 

2)	Everything is temporary. By that I mean that in large cities everyone is free to move around, change jobs and neighbourhoods and redefine themselves constantly – which is great, but it doesn’t help your social life. People have this attitude – why meet my neighbours when I might move out tomorrow? Everyone is constantly moving, friendships are short-lived and easily forgotten. You go to a meetup or a social club a second time and the whole group is made up of completely different people. You have a friend here and an acquaintance there, usually non-compatible so you keep them apart (and when you don’t, it’s super awkward) and it takes time to keep up with everyone individually. Friendships take time but nobody has time for friendships. 

3)	Most English people are shy. There, I said it. First of all, they NEVER take the initiative. When they come out for a drink they might have a great time but that doesn’t mean they will pick up the phone next time. I don’t feel comfortable chasing after people all the time because then I start to wonder that maybe they don’t want to hang out with me. But when we eventually meet they will say ‘Oh, I’m so glad we met, I haven’t had a drink in a month.’ Pick up the phone, damn it! Not to mention that many people you first meet are extremely awkward to have a conversation with, since they will only reply politely when you ask them something and never ask anything back, making it feel like an interrogation. And speak up! It’s hard enough to understand what you say, why do you whisper in a loud pub? 
EDIT: Ok, this has definitely been misunderstood. I didn't mean it in a bad way and I certainly don't mean shy with strangers. I mean people I've known for years remain reserved and hardly ever talk about anything more personal apart from work maybe. And they are this way with everyone, not just me. I have some lovely, warm English friends and I never said that all of them are this way. 

There are probably many other factors too but these are the ones I can think of right now. I have to add that being in your 30s and in a relationship doesn’t help either. Many people I meet feel that they have to do everything in couples, but that doesn’t help friendships either. I have been here for years and honestly I’m starting to give up. If I didn’t have my partner I would probably be depressed from loneliness. Coming from a Mediterranean culture where you are surrounded by family and friends and you know all your neighbours and you hang out with people every single day of the week, London, sometimes, with its millions of people, feels like the loneliest place on earth. 

EDIT: Thank you very much for your replies, I will definitely think about what you said. 

To those who said I might be a 'cunt,' and talk about whining etc, what can I say? It's hard to ask for advice online without getting people who will jump to conclusions for the sake of being negative. 

FINAL EDIT: Ok guys, seriously now. Many people are jumping to conclusions and that probably means I wasn't clear enough. I'm a very social person and I do go out quite often. But many of the friendships I have never get over the initial stage. Perhaps I have a different cultural standard of what a friendship is. I like the mocking and the bonding and the late night drunk deep conversations. My friends here like polite dinners and talking about work. Yes, years after we've known each other. And I've seen them interacting with their own friends and it's not that different. I certainly don't think that everyone is this way. So sorry if I offended anyone but please don't assume the worst in the things I say. This was not to complain or blame anyone. These were just some thoughts that I wanted to share.

Inevitably, when discussing where I live with non-Londoners, the topic of ""how rude"" people in London are (in a similar vein to comments about Paris, for example).

They will tell stories of angry people on the tube or on pavements glaring at them, or telling them off, or generally barging past them.

Yet I don't perceive this to be the case. I take this as the experience of people who are not used to a busy city - and in many cases, not used to the application of common sense to everyday situations - being unable to admit they did something a little bit silly.

Example:

""People in London are so rude. When I went down there for the day, I was just trying to get on the train at Oxford Circus and everyone kept shoving me out of the way and I couldn't get on. They're so rude and selfish"" 

Reality: ""I decided to try and get on the train at 6pm, during rush hour, in one of the busiest cities in the world, at one of the busiest stations, and when the train doors opened, everyone started getting off. Even though there was no room for me to do so, and it didn't really make any sense for me to try, I decided it would be a good idea to barge through everyone and take my place on the train, but for some reason they didn't see me getting on as being as important as them getting off"".

Example 2: 

""I was walking down Regent street and everyone was just rushing past and bumping into me, how rude these Londoners are.""

Reality: ""I was slowly meandering down Regent Street with no particular direction and I stopped outside Hamleys to text my friend without any warning and someone bumped into me and told me to look out""

And while I'm ranting, why is it that whenever I tell a non-Londoner where I'm from, it's perceived as being perfectly OK for them to spend 20 minutes complaining about how busy and noisy and rude and expensive it is and how I'm a mug for paying extortionate amounts for housing, food, transport and beer, and yet I can't turn back to them and say, ""Oh, you live in Hull? Yeah that's a fucking shithole, everything's cheap because it sucks arse, there's no culture and you're all lazy bastards finishing work at 5pm""",,False,self,t5_2qkog,False,,city-of-westminster,True,t3_ymt7t,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/ymt7t/londoners_are_not_intrinsically_rude_discuss/,

They've pulled knives on him and broken in to his flat several times. They've left knives as death threats after robbing him at knife point and held his friends captive whilst tied up when they have been in the flat and he's gone out for just 30 minutes. We installed cctv and they simply ripped it out (they were well covered and left no prints).

However... we installed Find my iPhone on a device and they broke in and stole it. We've traced them to a nearby tower block. The Police said they are powerless to act without an actual address - he's seen one and would recognise him again. Obviously my mate is terrified but wants to stop this happening to other people if he can. If anyone has any advice we're a little shocked right now and not thinking straight so we'd appreciate any advice.

UPDATE 1: We have a vehicle registration number from another resident. Called the police and they've sent two plods out to look around where it was seen just half an hour ago - initial reports is that ""they've gone"". The vehicle was apparently full of TV's and equipment in boxes - the find my iphone app is moving around and we think it's in the van.

LATEST UPDATE : TWO PEOPLE ARRESTED - off to the police station!

I said okay. I wasn't even friendly to him. then he took a bike without a ticket run away in rush. After he left I was trying to use my code to take a bike but no joy, that red light was blinking. I called tfl and they told me that the bike has been released. I figured out that the guy who approach to me read the code from the ticket which you can see from miles away and took the bike before I take a bike. after all I realised that while he was talking to me he read my ticket number (which is very big and short number) and took the bike before me. I was charged £150. I called the police and stuff but you know the UK where robbers protected by law over you.  

I've been really ill and had surgery a month ago. last 6 month I've been in lots of pain. today finally i had no pain. I was like too happy and decided to cycle. I was like flying. than this happened. money is not a problem I just asked myself why me? why?????   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPK_651K3zI

[this is the ticket that tfl uses](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/4b/da/2a/barclays-cycle-hire.jpg)

well what I want to say is when you hire cycle just careful please. thanks for reading my text with terrible English.

Edit: Thank you very much for your help guys. I really appreciate.

After waiting 15 minutes to get on a tube and a short while on the train I reached my destination. Slightly out-of-breath and pretty annoyed I arrived at the ticket barriers. A man to my right caught my attention, largely due to his wizard hat and cape. He strolled up to the gates as I was tapping my Oyster-card-enabled wallet against the top of the ticket machine. With a look of deadly seriousness on his face he pulled out a fairy wand from his coat and tapped it on the gates, which immediately opened. He had taken the RFID (or whatever technology) chip out of the card and inserted it into a wand.

This guy made my day.

I was perfectly warm and not overdressed.  

That being said, my trip was awesome.  I had some immaculate weather (two days were cloudless sunshine) and some of the best food I have ever had.  I found the people to be friendly, funny, and accommodating.  I used air b and b and stayed in a flat in Shoreditch and it was very fun.  I was very close to Hoxton station, so I didn't feel farther away than a few rides to anything I wanted to see.  

In case you were wondering why I thought the food was so awesome, these are the places I visited:

-A pub in Westminster for some fish and chips (random pub, had some yum food plus a Magners pear cider which was delicious)

-Dinner, by Heston Blumenthal (we made reservations months ago)

-A delicious steak pie and a sausage roll from Borough Market (and other yummy foods and drinks)

-Ottolenghi on Ledbury for some awesome salad, quiche, lamb, and a cupcake (I'm a big fan of Yotam recipes so I was excited to go)

-Poppies for fish and chips

-A cornish pasty which was awesome even though it was just off Oxford street in a touristy area

-Lots of chocolate and crisps from every store I passed (I like Cadbury fudge) and we brought home some scotch pancakes

We visited the War Rooms, the Imperial War Museum, the British Museum, Borough Market, Portobello Market, and many of the well known touristy areas as well.  

If you are wondering why I wrote this, its simply because I had an amazing time, and I just wanted to thank someone.  Although American, I tried to be respectful, quiet, and read/watch others before asking stupid questions.  In doing that, I had a great time joking around with any British person I met.  It didn't hurt that I brought a Brit with me.  

Also, I know it is London, and not indicative on England as a whole (just as New York isn't a representation of America) I found the men and women both to be very attractive.  That leads me to the logical conclusion that the UK has very attractive and tall people. ;)

Thanks for the trip and I wish if any of you visit the states that you can have as good of a time as I did.  

Edit: I'm retracting the ""tall"" statement. You people were just attractive, period. You know you don't have to be tall to be attractive, right? Plus I saw many of you sitting down, so who knows, you could have all been midgets...or children.

Edit 2: I am an idiot. I completely forgot to add that we also went down to Twickenham Stoop and watched the Quins beat Bath. Good game, kinda cold, more good cider. The very British guy next to me was screaming the most delightful things at the team - ""that was lovely!"" and ""brilliant!"" I loved it.

I thought as I wasn't making any money from it, and it wasn't doing any harm, they would just ignore it but apparently not.

Worst comes to the worst I can take it down, but it was quite a bit of work and I'm pretty proud of it so it would be a last resort.

Anyone know if I can lobby or persuade TfL to be a bit more lenient? There are a huge number of tube map hacks out there, I just wonder why they've gone for this one.

I had to ask the driver to stop and see if the guy was alright and was met with 'Why, he ran into me?'. I had to threaten the guy with calling the police, before he would stop. The driver gets out of the car and speaks to the cyclist for 30 seconds, comes back and drives off.

At this point I was fucking livid. There was no way I was continuing my journey with this arsepiece, so I bundled-up my bags and told the guy to stop the car.

I proceed to leave the car. Cue the taxi driver giving me grief and telling me I owed him for the fare. I was like, 'Okay, but I'm calling the police now, I hope you enjoy losing your licence'. Then he drives off as if no fucks were given. By the time I walk down to the scene of the incident, the cyclist dude is gone. 

I have his registration and private licence number, the fucker is not getting away with this. I just wish I could have given the driver details to the cyclist. I've already called the company to tell them what happened, but I doubt they'll do anything.

Firstly i should apologise because I am *not* the type to scaremonger.  On the contrary, I have lived 33 years in this lovely city of ours and have never been the victim of any serious crime.  I've never even been mugged.  

But, something bad happened in the early hours this morning.  I got a call from my sister at 5am, who had just been woken up in her own bed by a stranger shining a torch in her face.  She screamed and he ran off, out the front window he came in through.  

Having called 999, the girl on the phone was really good, and offered to stay on the line until the police arrived (which my sister declined).  She also said if anything happens before they arrive, call 999 immediately, and they would know it was my sister calling again.  Unfortunately, there was no one from Brixton police available, so the police that arrived first were actually from Elephant &amp; Castle station.  However, they were still there within 20 minutes, and they then waited until someone from Brixton arrived, and he then waited until I arrived.  So all in all, the police were very helpful, but it was a bit scary that no one from the local station was available to begin with.

Further more, due to cuts, there is now no 24 hour fingerprinting team - so they didn't arrive until about 10am (didn't matter in this case, but it might in others).

Anyway, why am I telling you all this?  Well, the police said that this is the prime time of year for this to happen.  It's much darker, and it's coming up to Christmas, and with recession etc. they expect it to happen more than usual.  And with police cuts, response times might be down.  The police specifically told my sister to let all her neighbours know what had happened (and I obviously thought to myself that I'll tell reddit).  

My sister lives in a ground floor flat.  They said that he almost certainly targeted that flat because the curtains in the front room (which face the street) were open, so he thought no one was in.  So you can literally make yourself safer just by shutting the curtains and making sure the windows are locked.  A light attached to a movement sensor is also usually enough to deter someone.  

Such simple things, but they really work.

Anyway, apologies again for the apparent scaremongering, but it was a really, *really* unpleasant thing to happen and if I can stop it happening to someone else just be reminding them to shut the curtains, then I've done my good deed for the day!

Stay safe, peeps.

Dx

TL;DR.  Shut curtains, lock windows, especially at this time of year.  

EDIT: appreciate you guys reading this.  Just to answer some points - he was probably in the flat for less than a minute in total.  The bedroom door (which was open) is right next to the front room door (he got in through the window in the front room).  He went into the bedroom, realised someone was in, my sister screamed, and he bolted immediately.  Police were sure he assumed it was empty because of the open curtains.  She lives at the Elm Park end of Leander road, which is a fairly gentrified part of Brixton (as far as gentrification in Brixton goes that is!).  It's the Streatham end, not the Elephant end, not sure why the first police to turn up were from Elephant, but they were.  She's been there for years, got nice neighbours, there's a nice local (in fact a Redditor does the pub quiz there on a thursday night - Elm Park Tavern) and it's not in the least bit threatening.  Having said that, she had a sat nav nicked out of her car once about a year ago.

I'll start with some advice: if you are out and about drinking and someone comes to you saying they need money cause they were hurt and they look like they are bleeding etc and asking for money - its probably a scam. Just ask if you should call the police/ambulance, instead of giving them money.

Byron Burger is a good burger.

Oregano, off upper street, is good pizza.

The Barclays Bikes are quite useful.

Thats all I can think of for now!

Update: I forgot to mention the canal that runs through islington, shoreditch, hackney etc etc. its a really nice walk, and there is a pub along the way. You can walk all the way to broadway market (which happens on saturdays).

My son, wife and I returned home from an afternoon at the swimming pool and meeting friends putting on a local panto at a pub near here (Telegraph Hill) to find a fellow running from our flat with one of my wife's bags under his arm. We were soon to find out it contained both our laptop computers. I chased for a while, but possibly being down to both our chosen professions, he was the faster. 

**Stolen was (for posterity):**

Seriously, do check around when leaving your home and don't leave things like computers or anything obviously of value out in your sitting room. Strangely, a police woman had approached my kid and I while we were at the nearby park yesterday afternoon to warn us that there were a series of burglaries and robberies in the area over the last couple of weeks. This got the idea about these things happening in my kid's head and then, as we returned home, he (age 4) got to see it first hand. This is probably the worst part of it, since it really left him shaken up and he didn't sleep hardly at all last night, thinking someone was going to come in the house. Coming in a close 2nd place was the loss of photos, audio and video files and other digital curiou from his first four years of existance.


While filling out the report with the police here, we were informed that there had been a series of similar burglaries just about each night in the area. As they were at our house, we could here reports being radioed out, literally from other streets in the area, of similar burglaries going on nearby.

We've just moved from elsewhere in the neighbourhood to this location and had not got the home insurance set up or locks changed in time for this, and it's going to be a shitty holidays now, with this in the back of his head.

So, do take care. There are some really crap people out there looking to grab what's yours.",,False,self,t5_2qkog,False,,lewisham,True,t3_146zee,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/146zee/burglaries_in_south_london_be_wary_when_leaving/,

**IGNORE BELOW NOW - MEGA SAD**

Hello all,
On 22nd January at 3pm in Waterloo station, London, I am going to ask my amazing girlfriend to marry me. She's been tapping her shoe waiting for a marriage proposal for a little while now, so I hope she'll say yes! In order to make it special for her I thought I'd organise a simple flashmob for the occasion, as a surprise (everyone gets down on one knee - no dancing or anything I'm afraid).

I have not really done anything like this before, so have started by simply emailing friends. Facebook is not really on because she uses it heavily. Does anyone have any experience organising this kind of thing and can give me any tips? Also if you want to come along that would be cool!

**Details of flashmob if interested:**

At 1500 my girlfriend will arrive to meet me at Waterloo accompanied by a complicit friend of hers. This will be near the clock, at the bottom of the escalator to waterloo east, where we had our first kiss.
I will be there from 1400, in a blue blazer with red shoes on, drumming up passer-by support.
After we meet, her friend will drop back and, after a moment, wave a RED FLAG. This will be the signal for action!
At the red flag everyone will drop to one knee. I will then follow suit and pop the question. If things go according to plan (crossed fingers) she'll say yes, and I'll give the thumbs up. A cheer would be AWESOME at this point, and then, as per flash mob etiquette, a full dispersal of people back to apparent normality.

**EDIT**

Sorry for the poor grammar and style I was in a rush and in a very bad mood.

Edit1: (stuff to hopefully prove i'm not insane) I'm a college Junior at a small college in North Carolina studying Electronic Media/Communications. I'm 20 years old and am a semi-professional improviser. I grew up and was raised in the DC area and have been to London once before while the underground bombings/live Aid concerts were going on. (ex) GF is studying at LSE and I believe I'm in Bloomsbury. I currently am in a starbucks near the Ripleys Believe it or Not building. I kinda wanna try some afternoon tea before I leave. Also, is the cider considered a girly drink? Because I really like it.

Edit2: I'm currently at Euston Station. (it's pretty cold and wet outside so I wanted to get inside.) I really do appreciate everyone offering to buy my a cider or lager, I would love to meet up with as many as possible either tonight or tomorrow and buy you drinks for cheering up a total stranger. Apologies for the people who I couldn't meet up with right away I needed to find storage for my bags and some place that was warm. If any of you are at all available tomorrow I would love to start drinking as early as possible. 

Edit3: You the people of London just may be the most welcoming and kind people in the entire world. Thank you all for having my back.

Now with the disclaimer out of the way let me remind you again. YOU LONDONERS ARE ONE OF THE LUCKIEST PEOPLE OUT THERE.

You guys happen to live in the most beautiful city in the world. It pains me everysingle moment that I dont live there anymore because the powers that be thought i'am not worthy to live in the UK let alone London. Yeah im one of the fucking scum immigrants. No i never sponged off the system. i paid my International student fees and left without overstaying or siphoning off the social security funds. well thats not relevent is it now.

Boys and girls. its mid day here where i live. Im drunk and i miss london like crazy. Not that my life is bad here. im in relatively better postion here. i have a better job. Married the love of my life and achieved the mythical although very temporary 'stability'. But the only missig factor in my life is london.

i miss walking along the river from cutty's ark all the way upto i dont know where. Miss eating them hot dogs near that argos near trafalgard square on a freezing midnight. Miss walking in to a random pub and having a few pint alone. Miss waking up to beautiful london morning(people complaining about smog or the weather can go fuck themselves). Miss buying day bus pass and viting random places in the city.
Who the fuck is cutting them onions.
I dont know i miss the random bus drivers making witty comments in a night bus. I miss them all. Its fucking making me cry. The more days it passes since i left the city the more it hurts. Im fucking depressed.so much history so much beauty so nice people im missing it all.

Some day i want to come there for a few days. I dont know if i can even afford it aany longer. But keep it nice for me please. And hey irrespective of all your problems there is this city that that will go on to inspire. Oh god did that even make sense. if it dosent just igonore it.

Oi keep it nice for me ok

The Skints are a wonderful reggae/dub/ska/rock band from London and yesterday they had their van with all their equipment stolen.
They've been asking for help on Facebook and Twitter but I thought Reddit may be able to help them out too!

Below is what they have said about the stolen items. If you know anything that could help them out message them on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/theskints) or PM me if you don't use facebook.

**This is a self post, so I'm not at all in it for the Karma** *(well maybe for real life but not the Reddit Kind)***, just trying to help them out.**

&gt;Bad news. At some point this morning our tour manager's van was stolen whilst parked on Josh's road. ALL (yes, all) of our equipment and touring merchandise was on board as well as TomTom's and some personal effects (including Marcia's stage dresses). Some of our stuff was insured, but most of it isn't. If anybody in any guitar shops or Crack Converters sees any equipment with ""THE SKINTS"" marked up on, let us know or if anyone's knocking out/thrown away our merch on the side. And if anybody in the London Borough of Redbridge/Waltham Forest/anywhere in the country sees a Mercedez Sprinter reg HT03 FUD, please let us know. And pull the bastards out the door and start stomping GTA style. We'll keep you updated. Please buy some CDs and t-shirts cos this has definitely fucked us up. Peace.x


&gt;Right, quick description for our little but pricey objects in case you guys find them in shops: Altus Silver Flute (A1107) in a protective hard case (looks a bit like a large grey humbug haha), Alto Yanagisawa Saxophone 901, KORG SV1 stage vintage piano (Red, 73 keys), Audio-Technica ATW701 Wireless system, Markbass little mark 3 Bass amp. There is obviously much more missing but these things are easily sold so well worth letting you guys know about. Thank you so much for the overwhelming support guys x

I was in there at the weekend and couldn't believe it was £2.65 for a Becks and £2.80 for a Guinness. You wouldn't spend longer than a football match in there though but its certainly not the worst pub ive been in. Tends to attract Chelsea fans with three rolls of neck fat.

Post yours up and I'll make a list and a Google map. I'm excluding ale as it's generally cheaper.

**Edit:** Some great suggestions so far, keep them coming. I'm going to create the map tonight and keep adding to it over time.

He was in Oakleigh park when he ran out and down Bennetts close and was last seen on Lillian road. He was wearing a tag with both phone numbers of myself and my girlfriend but no one has called. We are not in the country right now and we are returning as soon as we can. Our friends are out looking for him and they have put posters up as well as called the local police, battersea, RSPCA and are visiting local vets. If someone has found him or seen him can they comment below? Or if anyone has any info or suggestions of what to do that would be great. We are hoping he is safe and that a decent person has found him. We realise he may be found and someone will sell him on so we need to spread the word as wide as we can to find him. If anyone can help us that would be great.

He has been micro-chipped. He was wearing a green reflective collar with a tag. He is neutered. He has no distinguishing scars. He is 2 years and 2 months old. He is registered to us.

EDIT: He has been FOUND!! He some how made it to Croydon and was hanging around a crematorium. Thank you to all who helped and supported us.

If possible [get one](https://oyster.tfl.gov.uk/oyster/link/0005.do) before you come, or if not you can get one at a TFL ticket office when you arrive here.

The main reason you should get your hands on one is because when using it (rather than cash) fares are almost halved. For instance a bus ride would cost you £2.30 (about $3.56 USD) if you pay by cash or £1.35 (about $2.10 USD) if you were to use an Oyster Card. 

Unfortunatly I have seen nothing in regard to the advertisement of getting an Oyster for the games, and I feel that this is because they are going to make an extortionate amount of money from those coming here not knowing it can save them a great deal of money. Fare prices are costly enough with the Oyster Card, and I'm sure you'd rather be spending it on things other than sitting next to a sweaty obese man on the tube (me basically).

Originally only intended as promotion for the Olympic Games, Virgin Media has announced that it will extend its free Wi-Fi network offer until 2013, according to a report in the Telegraph.

The service is to remain free whilst Virgin negotiate with rival ISP's who might want in on the action giving the possibility that others could keep you connected on the tube for nothing in the future.

At present the free network is available in 72 stations with it eventually to reach around 120 in the near future. According to Virgin, since its roll-out in July 2012, 660,000 people have registered to use the network with 443,000 of those doing so during the Olympic Games alone.

Two friends and I are starting a 'Street Restaurant' called Caboose this summer and we would love to have your support during its launch! We're not asking for any money (breathe a sigh of relief), just for people to 'like' our facebook page and follow us on twitter if at all possible.

A caboose is the last carriage on an old train where the workers chilled out, ate and occasionally had to slow the train down by applying the brakes. We're currently building our own custom made caboose from which we're going to sell slow-smoked barbecue and big salads with a dining area in the back. We're going to be based in the Shoreditch / Brick Lane area all summer and onward.

In a short while, we will be holding a launch party and everybody will be invited!

You can check our temporary website out at:

This did not happen, the bus hit him at great speed and everything and everyone on the bus went flying forward.

Anyway I had to call the ambulance and thankfully three ambulances came within minutes (probably it is because it's opposite St Thomas' Hospital). They made me stay on the phone even after the ambulances arriving to give feedback.

I think the ambulance team did a great job so kudos to them, including one doctor (I think) on site who was wearing a purple medical clothing rather than the normal ambulance staff uniform.

Really hope the bloke is alright.

1349720057.0,62,self.london,115dhf,"Some advice for Americans visiting London, from an American",arojay,71,9,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/115dhf/some_advice_for_americans_visiting_london_from_an/,"After having just spent a couple of weeks in the UK, with the bulk of the time being spent in and around London, I decided to make a list of the cultural and regional differences that might confuse or surprise other visiting Americans. Think of this as a guide on how to not immediately look like an American tourist.

* Tennis shoes. They're called trainers in the UK, and I noticed that they are nowhere near as commonly worn in public as in the US. And definitely not white ones. If you insist on wearing your sneakers for comfort, make them a dark color so you don't immediately stand out.
* Baseball caps. Just don't. I don't think there is a bigger flashing red sign for ""American tourist"".
* Tipping. The standard 15-20% that you're used to is not required at restaurants. Unlike the US, the waitstaff already makes a livable wage, and so it is purely about exceptional quality of service. I typically left about 10% for good service. Cab drivers I would round up to the nearest pound, or just give them a pound if they were helpful and friendly and it was a longer trip.
* Eating out. Speaking of eating at a proper sit-down restaurant, you'll find that service is much slower and relaxed than you're used to. In the US, the entire ordeal usually takes a maximum of 40 minutes. Waitstaff is interested in moving people through tables, and someone sitting in their section for 90 minutes is eating into their income. In the UK (and most of Europe), that isn't a factor. I found I generally had to ask for the check, as they were perfectly content with me sitting there endlessly. That actually was something I had to get past, as usually in the US if you have to flag down and ask for your check, it means the waitperson isn't paying attention to their job. If you have to ask for your check, don't take it personal, and be polite.
* The tube. I'd heard some people make a big deal about how unfriendly people are on the underground. I honestly didn't find it any different than the metro system of any large city in the US. Just mind your own business and don't stare. Same as New York, same as DC, same as Chicago.
* Burgers. Everything that comes on a bun seems to be called a burger. Where in the US, burger tends to refer more to the ground meat. I bought a ""chicken burger"" at one of the small fast food places in west London, and it was literally a piece of fried chicken stuck between a bun.
* Iced Tea. Don't ask for it. If you're lucky enough to find it, it will probably be the nasty Lipton in a can.
* Politeness. Want to fit in better in an informal setting like a small store, fast food place or pub? When a cashier gives you your change, say, ""Cheers,"" instead of ""Thank you.""
* Driving. If you've never driven in the UK before, I would advise against making your first attempt be in London. You'll probably be nervous enough driving on the left, trying to keep the car centered in the lane, and fretting the upcoming roundabout. You don't want to be doing it alongside thousands of other cars. Other than that, I found the roads are well signage'd so it's not too difficult to figure out where you need to go.
* Public transit. Learn the bus system. It's amazingly efficient compared to almost anywhere else I've been. If you don't mind a longer trip, going somewhere on the bus is massively cheaper than using the tube, depending on the time of day.
* Cell phone. Get your phone unlocked before you go, and buy a prepaid SIM card that includes data. You'll thank me later. I bought one from O2 for £10 that included 500 MB of data. More than enough for a couple weeks. Google Maps on Android works wonderfully with all the bus stations and schedules.

I'm sure I'll think of more to add later, or feel free to add more below.",,False,self,t5_2qkog,1349725176.0,,,True,t3_115dhf,http://www.reddit.com/r/london/comments/115dhf/some_advice_for_americans_visiting_london_from_an/,

My band is booked to open an event called ""Festival: Live"" at the Water Rats tomorrow evening - [details here](http://londonist.com/2012/05/festivallive-at-monto-water-rats-kings-cross-this-saturday.php). We're on at around 6.15pm.

Unfortunately, this weekend seems to be a ""perfect storm"" in terms of our normal friends and fans having other commitments, and the guest list is looking exceptionally short. The promoter is saying that if at least 15 people don't come along we won't be allowed to play, and we certainly won't be asked back again. Right now that's looking alarmingly possible.

So if you happen to like live music, and you're free, you'd be doing me a huge favour if you could come along to see my band (The Red Queens). Come up and introduce yourself before we go on and I'll buy you a drink. 

If you're interested, you can hear some of our songs on [our website](www.redqueens.co.uk). There are seven (!) other bands performing, so even if you don't like us you might fancy sticking around afterwards...

A million thanks in advance if you can help. Even if you can't help, thanks for reading this far!

**EDIT** Thanks everyone for upvoting this and giving it some visiblity - I really appreciate it. I don't know if any Redditors actually showed up in the end, but we played to a decent crowd and the promoter seemed happy, so the story has a happy ending and you guys helped.

My name's Toby and I've decided to open up a board game bar and cafe in London.

I was inspired after hearing about the Snakes and Lattes cafe in Toronto ([link](http://www.snakesandlattes.com/)) and feel there is a massive gap in the market in London as there are loads of board gamers and gaming groups, but no dedicated board game venue.

The bar will be called Draughts and will have hundreds of board games ranging from Chess and Jenga to Eclipse and Diplomacy and everything in between and we will host regular tournaments and special nights. It will also serve high quality guest ales, ciders and lagers. Beers will be regularly changed, with votes held on possible new choices, or the return of old favorites. (more info at the [about](http://www.boardgamesandbeer.com/about) page of our website)

I've just set up our website at http://www.boardgamesandbeer.com/ and will be updating regularly through our blog there.

Currently everything is still in planning stages. If you can spare 3 minutes, please help us by filling out our survey (https://www.surveyplanet.com/survey/c6db2485131a42501fdabd0350047745) and following us on twitter (https://twitter.com/Draughtslondon). I've posted this in /r/boardgames, but would be really interested to get some survey responses from a non-board game crowd in London.

If anyone has any questions, feel free to AMA.

A list of venues where you can watch the Olympics on big screens. Most are free. Some recommend getting prebooked tickets to secure entry in case it is crowded. Most are NOT showing the opening/closing ceremony though.

If I missed any off, please add them in the comments below.

[Victoria Park](http://www.london2012.com/join-in/live-sites/london/site=victoria-park/)

You can just turn up and be let in if there is space, or better to book guaranteed entry tickets in advance. Two giant screens will share the park with a series of smaller screens showing BBC live coverage.

[Hyde Park](http://www.london2012.com/join-in/live-sites/london/site=hyde-park-1238734/)

You can just turn up and be let in if there is space, or better to book guaranteed entry tickets in advance. Viewing of the Olympic Games via a series of big screens, including the largest one in the UK.

[Tower Bridge](http://www.molpresents.com/picture)

Watch the action on a big screen in Potters Fields Park next to Tower Bridge.

[Lewisham](http://www.lewisham.gov.uk/inmyarea/olympics/The-Lewisham-Big-Screen/Pages/default.aspx)

A big outdoor screen and line-up of free entertainment and activities. The festival site is open from 8.30am to 10.30pm each day. Funfair and family amusements are also open everyday until 10pm.

[Woolwich](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bigscreens/locations/woolwich/?source_url=/bigscreens/locations/woolwich)

The BBC are setting up a big screen in the refurbished town square.

[Waltham Forest](http://www.bbc.co.uk/bigscreens/locations/waltham/)

The BBC are setting up a big screen in the large open space by the main shopping centre.

[Hackney](http://www.hackney.gov.uk/bigscreen-haggerston.htm)

As well as live broadcasts, there will also be a wide range of sporting activities on offer.

[Camden](http://www.roundhouse.org.uk/camden-beach)

An artificial beach location with covered marquee housing a big screen.

[Canary Wharf](http://www.canarywharf.com/visitus/Arts--Events1/Events/Canary-Wharf-Summer-Screen/)

A big screen in the park between the main 3 skyscrapers.

[Euston - UCL](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/staff/staff-news/0612/29062011-screenonthequad)

Screen in the main Quad by the [entrance](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/locations/ucl-maps/ucl-bloomsbury-campus-map). Quite small, might be best for locals only though.

...Olympic Houses.

These are venues set up by the various nations attending and have big screens and related entertainments. Most are free, some charge. Details on my [blog](http://www.ianvisits.co.uk/blog/2012/07/23/cultural-food-and-drink-events-during-the-olympics/)

Two venues that have an admission fee.

[Kings Cross](http://www.houseofnations.co.uk/kings_cross/)

Club/bar type environment - costs £16.67 to get inside, and that is the cheap ticket.

[Tower of London](http://www.houseofnations.co.uk/tower_of_london/)

Tented arena in the moat - costs £16.67 to get inside, and that is the cheap ticket.

Although running a brothel in it might fall foul of the later terms and clauses like ""no immoral or illegal purposes"".  Which brings up an interesting sidepoint.  **Whose morals?**

In the time when I was originally looking for places to live in London, I noticed (and briefly refreshed my memory with a quick gumtree search), that there are a *staggering* proportion of landlord listings online where some, or all of the following are stated.

* Females Only
* No Pork Products 
* Muslims Only
* Jews Only

It puzzles me.  I've pretty much never seen it anywhere else, even other big cities like Birmingham or Brighton.  If it's generally accepted that you wouldn't get away with having ""No (insert race/orientation here)"" on your house advert, so why is it seemingly acceptable (in that it happens) to have XYZ Only, or more puzzlingly still ""No Pork"".  Surely that's part and parcel of the Quiet Enjoyment - Exercising my right to eat bacon (Something that really should be signed into law.)
I suppose it depends to some extent if you're renting a flat, or a room in a shared house.  

I mean, if the landlord found pork products so objectionable, would that really stand up in an english court of law? To be evicted for what you eat?  That seems needlessly discriminatory.. Kinda.  

Especially the women only ones, they sound like a prime case of positive discrimination.

I just wanted to make you aware of what's going on with Addison Lee, the ubiquitous minicab firm with 4,000 drivers in London. I hope it might give you food for thought when you next hire a minicab.

You probably already know that AddLee boss John Griffin has instructed his drivers [to drive in bus lanes](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2012/apr/19/tory-donor-addison-lee-bus-lanes?INTCMP=SRCH), and offered to indemnify them against TfL fines, putting pedestrians, cyclists and bus users at risk (not to mention breaking the law) in order to increase profits.

You might also be aware that John Griffin quietly donated £250,000 to the Conservative party to gain the ear of Transport Minister, something that has understandably caused outrage in the national media.

But I think the worst and most revealing piece of information has surfaced on the web in the last 24 hours... [It's an editorial piece written by Griffin for Addison Lee's internal magazine](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9QWEV9-JP6o/T5BFbDw72OI/AAAAAAAAAr4/F_P27PDdwos/s1600/AddisonLee+cycilng.jpg) in which he airs some frankly disgusting views about other roads users.

I'd really like to hear what other Londoners think about this. Personally, I will not be using their services again.
