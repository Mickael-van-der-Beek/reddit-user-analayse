1334232508.0,202,self.NewToTF2,s61pa,Why you shouldn't play at Gentlemann's Estate.,,232,30,141,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/s61pa/why_you_shouldnt_play_at_gentlemanns_estate/,"First off it's not even slightly a good server for new players. Everyone who plays is pretty dang good and will make fun of you if you are not as good as them.

Secondly: Apparently it's ran by another self righteous server owner like 99% of other servers. I designed their website for them (twice because he switched forum software) and last night I enabled the gscramble plugin because without it the players were having a bad experience due to the autoscramble not working correctly. I wake up this morning with all of my rights removed and Deltadude crying in steam chat about he specifically stated to not enable any plugins. I'm curious to why he told me he's managed numerous TF2 servers and yet none of them are still running right now. Maybe it's doing the complete opposite of what your players want? For someone who asked me to be a ""partner"" and ""not do everything I demand"" you sure showed me buddy.

My point? Stay away from Gentlemann's Estate. I'm sure the folks here at NewToTF2 will agree. We've all been screwed over by this guy one way or another. One of these days I'll start charging people for this crap.

Another thing I've noticied is that this guy has over $1,000 in his server accounts. Put this together with the fact that he's ran numerous servers that failed, I'm thinking he collects donations, shuts down the servers and starts over. So if you DO go play, for the love of god think twice before donating.


TL;DR I'm pretty sure Gentlemann's Estate is a scam.

**EDIT 1:** Now I've magically been banned from the website &amp; server as well. I didn't know people were so touchy about a simple plugin being enabled. Good thing I only wasted a week on their website. Looks like he banned my wife too who was only playing on the server with me sometimes.

**EDIT 2:** I just noticed he took down the 2Fort server after it only being up for about 12 hours. He keeps doing that as well. He'll open a new server for a day or so then shut it down. The main one is the only one that's stayed up.

**EDIT 3:** [Possible NewToTF2 Server?](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/s6j94/possible_newtotf2_official_server/)

**FYI**: I just put up a 24 slot payload and CP server: 74.91.122.35:27015 [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Funkitown)

EDIT: **I wanted to come back and state that this server sadly will NOT be an official server for NewtoTF2. I spoke with Lapper and they will not have a server that isn't ran by them so my server is out of the question. I still hope some of you will come play with us though.**",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_s61pa,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/s61pa/why_you_shouldnt_play_at_gentlemanns_estate/,

**Medic overview:**

* Is considered a light class.  Has 150 health.
* Moves at 106% speed, and thus is faster than all classes except the scout.
* Generally considered high value kills, even if the player is particularly unskilled.
* Relatively weak in direct combat(What Douglas Adams would call ""Mostly harmless."")
* Mechanics(The Ubercharge) allow for superhuman feats of action
* Is capable of extending the life of his team mates beyond merely restoring their health.

Their roles in a team are...

* Healing injured players
* Extinguishing burning players
* Actively maintaining front line classes mid combat(Soldiers, demos, heavies, pyros)
* Deploying ubercharges at critical times, for defensive and offensive purposes
* Above all else: Surviving

They excel in...

* Team Support
* Nest clearing(Medigun)
* Crowd clearing(Kritztrieg)

They are vulnerable to...

* Anyone, except spies, if caught alone.
* Spies, if they're oblivious to their existence.
* Snipers, at all times.
* Scouts, when their team has poor observation skills.

**A few words on the medic...**

The Medic is one of the handful of classes that people suggest that new players take a role in.  The medic is an immense support class, and even novice players can have a huge impact on a team's success.  It is a great moral booster, and gives you the opportunity to follow veteran players around maps for a guided(and guarded) tour.

What most players wind up doing is starting out as medic, getting good as a medic, then finding other classes that they're good at and begin playing those.  When they come back to medic, despite not having played medic in a long time, they'll find that they have become better medics.  

The reason for this is that medic is a largely experience based class.  They're very easy to get into, and you become better at playing them the more you experience the mechanics of the game, even if you're not playing medic at the time.

On to the guide.

**Healing**

The main function of the medic is to keep his team alive.  Using the medigun on your fellow players will heal them up to 150% of their total life(Heavies have 450 health when overhealed by a medic, soldiers have 300, etc.)  

Any amount of healing, or overhealing, or overheal maintaining done will contribute to your ubercharge meter.

**Ubercharges**

Once your ubercharge meter reaches 100%, you are ready to deploy an ubercharge using your secondary fire button(By default, this is your right mouse button.)

The ubercharge does something based on which medigun you have equipped.  I will go into more details about the actual weapons later.  For now, here is a list of the 3 different types of ubercharges.

* The Ubercharge: The standard Medigun's ubercharge.  This makes both you and your patient invulnerable for 8 seconds.  You are still vulnerable to pushback effects.  This is an excellent tool for dispatching enemy sentry nests, or warding off a large enemy push. 
* The Kritz: The Krtiztrieg's ubercharge.  This makes your patient fire nothing but critical attacks for the next 8 seconds.  This is devastating in the hands of a soldier, demoman or heavy.
* The Quick Fix:  The Quick Fix's ubercharge.  This ubercharge rapidly heals you and your patient while preventing knock backs from enemy fire.  Unlike the standard ubercharge, you can capture points while using this charge.  This is excellent maintaining several team members, and its extremely fast recharge rate permits repeated use.

**Okay, so, who am I supposed to be healing first?**

This is often the most frustrating part of playing a medic  Keep these two priority lists in mind when you heal, and it should simplify it.

List 1: Status
From highest priority to lowest priority.

* Burning or Bleeding
* Taking continuous, or repeated damage.
* Severely injured
* Injured
* Uninjured
* Takes health packs while you're near.

List 2: Identity/Activity

* Fellow medic
* On the front line
* Retreating from the front line
* On the second line
* Using a dispenser.
* Healing the player would greatly endanger your life.

Example scenario:  You have a sniper, 2 soldiers, a heavy and a medic in a fight.

The soldiers and the heavy are on the front line.  The sniper is camping a dispenser and sniping from the second line.  The medic is pocketing one of the soldiers.  You(another medic) are just getting into the fight.

A pyro round a corner and one of the soldiers shoots in panic.  The pyro airblasts in panic and instantly kills the soldier, and severely injures and ignites the medic.  The heavy winds up his gun in time and kills the pyro, but not before catching on fire himself.

**Who do you heal?**:  The Medic.   The medic is both severely injured and burning, and is capable of healing the heavy who is also burning, provided you save his life.

Scenario #2:  You arrive to a fight as it is going on.  The front line is decimated, but survivors are healthy thanks to a nearby dispenser. This is a scene straight out of Meet the Medic.    

A heavy, demoman, scout, engineer and sniper are all in the fight.  

The sniper is a huntmans(the bow) and is braving the front lines because the other team members were recently killed in a freak rocket jump accident.  

The engineer is maintaining his gun and his dispenser, and is accessible by the entire team, but is not in light of sight of the enemy.  

The scout is up close and personal with the enemy team and is flanking them mercilessly.

The demoman is around the corner spamming the enemy team from behind cover with his grenades and stickies.

2 soldiers and a pyro come out of the enemy's spawn.  A freak crocket nails the heavy(who had a small overheal from you, so he survives), and the pyro hits the sniper with a flare gun.  The second soldier hits the scout with a rocket, nearly killing him  The demoman sets off his stickies and kills all 3 of the on coming attacks, but not before a stray rocket splashes you, dropping you to about 90 health.

**What do you do?**  There are no more incoming enemies at the moment(the demoman killed them.)  You extinguish the sniper first, then heal the heavy, then heal whatever is left on the sniper's health.  

The scout is too close to the enemy and is not reliable protection should someone else come out.  Extending yourself could result in you getting killed as soon as someone rounds the corner, or comes out of the enemy spawn.  Surviving, above all else.

The scout(smartly) returns to the front line and uses the engineer's dispenser to heal himself.  Top yourself off using the dispenser, then return to the front line and provide over healing to the scout(if he stops for it) and sniper, then the heavy.  

The sniper is at a higher risk of dying should he get hit early on, where as the heavy can stand to take a few attacks before he becomes critical.  The over heal on the sniper will more likely save his life than the heavy's life.  Because you have so few options now, saving every life you can is important, so long as it doesn't risk your own.

** I AM FULLY CHARGED. **: Somehow, the meager amount of healing you've done has managed to charge your uber.  Your dead team returns(You gain a pyro, a soldier, and 5 spies).  The soldier and pyro join you on the front line, and no one is really sure where the spies are.  The demoman steps out into the front line, eager to take the ubercharge.

The enemy team spawns 4 soldiers, a heavy, a medic, an engineer, and 3 spies.  The heavy and medic are on the left, firing from a doorway while the right has the rest of their team behind a wall, shooting rockets willy-nilly.

**Who do you uber?**:  The Demoman.

The soldier only has 4 shots, and will not likely be able to kill the enemy heavy-medic combo as well as the rest of the enemy team on the opposite side.  The heavy is slow, while he will be able to clear one side of the skirmish, he will be unlikely to kill both sides.  The pyro is fast, but has limited range and will not be able to make good use of the uber until he is right on the enemy, which means the approach will be dangerous without first using the uber(which, unfortunately wastes time on the uber.)  The demoman's large capacity, high medium range damage makes him a great patient for this fight.

""Not one of you is going to survive this!"" he shouts, hurling stickies at the heavy and splattering the heavy medic combo into nothing.  Next come the soldiers, and you still have half of the uber left.  The engineer runs like hell, but the soldiers get caught in the blast and die, along with 2 spies.

The demoman taunts.

**What do you do?**:  You pull out your saw and murder the spy you see approaching your demoman, **because he missed one.**

Which takes me to my next point.

**Observation**

Your job is to survive.  This means you need to know what is going on around you most of the time.  The medic has to spend less concentration on aiming than any other class, which frees them up to be what many people believe to be their best role:  The Team Captain.

This doesn't mean you should be bossy or instructive to your team, but you should be able to warn your fellow players.

If you have a mic, and you are playing medic, your team will benefit greatly if you call out incoming enemies, or locations of enemy spies.  Alerting your team to potential threats(or victims) will heighten their sense of awareness on the field, leading to not only your extended survival, but their's as well.  You can use voice commands to simulate this(IE: Incoming!  Spy!) if you lack a mic.

When I was new, I found it exceedingly difficult to find useful and relevant guides. Some of the most popular ones are wildly out of date. For an example of this, I point to the Scout, Engineer and Pyro guides by EvilDaedalus, which were made some four years ago. 

I'd also like to create a platform for sharing other useful resources. [Have a look at this](http://clugu.com/tf2mate/). It's easily one of the best places to customize your controls, but most people haven't a clue it exists.

So, in summary, I'd to use this thread as a platform for the whole subreddit to share useful guides and other resources. 

Although this is targeted at new players, I don't see anything wrong with offering resources aimed at more skilled players, perhaps even for those aspiring comp players. The purpose of this subreddit is to help new players, but a large part of that is helping them improve.

**Custom HUDs**:

What is a custom HUD and what does it do?

&gt; Team Fortress 2 allows players to modify their Heads Up Display from the default layout. Many community members have made modifications that are shared with the public. Reasons for using custom HUDs vary widely, but most agree that they are primarily to improve visibility of important information, e.g. health, ammo, or ÜberCharge meters, and move non-vital HUD panels aside. Which custom HUD you choose or choose not to use is all up to personal preference; there is no one HUD that is ""better"" than another.

I'd like to constantly update this list, but I need your help! If you feel that something was useful, post it here!

",,False,,t5_2rbtk,1337107757.0,,,True,t3_o6rgg,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/o6rgg/resources_for_new_players/,

This guide is meant to ensure all new Medics are a credit to their team.  While I'm no miracle worker, I'm a pretty decent Medic myself\[[1](http://i.imgur.com/EoqcZ.jpg)].

**ROLE**

 * SUPPORT CLASS
   * Keep your team alive with your Medigun/Kritzkrieg.
   * Break through defenses using your Ubercharge.
   * Cause mass casualties using your Kritzcharge.

**WEAPONRY**

 * PRIMARY WEAPONS: [Syringe Gun](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Syringe_gun) vs [Blutsauger](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Blutsauger), which unlocks after 10 [Medic achievements](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Medic_achievements).  The Syringe Gun has better passive HP regeneration (3-6 HP/sec) while the Blutsauger sacrifices passive regeneration (only 1-4 HP/sec) in favor of healing 3 HP for every needle that hits.  [Explanation and comparison of the Medic's passive regeneration](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AosFQx0tblI).
   * If you're rarely fending for yourself, the Syringe Gun's better passive regen would suit you better.  If you're constantly fighting off attackers, equip the Blutsauger to have healing on demand.

 * SECONDARY WEAPONS: [Medigun](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Medigun) vs [Kritzkrieg](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Kritzkrieg), which unlocks after 16 Medic achievements.  The Medigun's Ubercharge gives both you and your patient 8 seconds of invulnerability while the Kritzkrieg's Kritzcharge gives your patient 8 seconds of [critical hits](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Critical_hit).  The Kritzkrieg charges faster than the Medigun and has a taunt that heals\[[2](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Oktoberfest)], too.
   * The common rule is that you take the Medigun on offense to use your Ubercharge invulnerability to break through sentry nests (when necessary)\[[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I)], and take the Kritzkrieg on defense to use your Kritzcharge critical hits to cause mass casualities\[[4](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzuFo9k5wpw)].  Keep in mind, critical hits do *not* affect buildings.
   * If you have two Medics and a coordinated team you might want to have one Medigun Medic and one Kritzkrieg Medic so you have the best of both worlds.  The Medigun Medic will help destroy enemy buildings\[[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I)] while the Kritzkrieg Medic will help destroy enemy players\[[5](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk2hbsfW5WQ)].

 * MELEE WEAPONS: [Bonesaw](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Bonesaw) vs [Ubersaw](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/%C3%9Cbersaw), which unlocks after 22 Medic achievements.  The Bonesaw has a faster swing while each successful Ubersaw hit gives you 25% charge on your Medigun/Kritzkrieg.  You get the 25% charge only if you kill a disguised Spy, though.
   * The majority of Medics use the Ubersaw because in most cases the 25% charge you gain is worth more than a slightly faster swing\[[6](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ab0J0Uqhmcc)].  However, some think if a Medic is using his melee it must be a desperate situation, making the faster Bonesaw swing preferable.

**OPTIONS**

 * Under Options &gt; Keyboard:
   * Bind a key to ""[Loadout Quickswitch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTORy6BxX7g)"" so you can easily switch between weapons\[[7](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/a42gp/question_about_changing_weapons_on_the_fly/)].
 * Under Options &gt; Keyboard &gt; Advanced:
   * Turn on ""Fast Weapon Switching"" so you can just press 1, 2, and 3 to switch weapons.
 * Under Options &gt; Multiplayer &gt; Advanced:
   * Turn on ""Display damage done as text over your target"" so you know when you are successfully hitting your enemy.
   * ""MEDIC: Display a marker over the player you are healing"" will allow you to more easily see the player you are healing.
   * ""MEDIC: Injured teammates automatically call out"" is helpful if you [set the slider to something reasonable](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ajf4o/why_does_it_sound_like_my_door_is_ajar_when_i/c0hwwne).
   * ""Medigun continues healing without holding down fire button"" will allow you to just click on a player to heal them instead of having to click and hold.  Many have this turned on\[[8](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8xcm6/medic_sticky_healing_option_on_or_off/)], but there is a slight delay between clicking and healing\[[9](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/a4yzm/how_to_instantly_get_better_at_tf2_turn_on/c0fvt60)].  For that reason, [I prefer this script](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/a4yzm/how_to_instantly_get_better_at_tf2_turn_on/c0fw50r?context=2).
   * ""Remember the active weapon between lives"" and ""remember the 'last weapon' between lives"" both do what they say.  It can be handy since you heal with your secondary weapon, but normally spawn with your primary out.

**TIPS**

 * GENERAL
   * Medic basics: [TF2 Wiki](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Medic) and [TF2 Tactics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xaMeZoV5-qs)
   * *Always* heal other Medics.
   * Have at least one Medic for every six players on your team.
   * If you're alone, always have your primary weapon out to defend yourself.
   * Your life is more important than any other classes besides another Medic with more charge.  Just because you're healing someone who is suicidal doesn't mean you need to follow them to their death.  However, this doesn't mean act like you're going to Uber/Kritz someone then let them run into battle and die without using the charge on them.
 * STAYING ALIVE
   * Always try to heal your patient while hiding behind corners or other obstacles so you will be out of the line of fire.  This is especially important when you unleash a Kritzcharge, since you're not invulnerable like you're with an Ubercharge.  Whenever possible also try to have your back up against the wall so you aren't an easy backstab. 
   * If you must be out in the open always try to be move unpredictably.
   * Don't forget to look behind you for flankers such as Pyros, Scouts, and especially Spies.  If you see a ""teammate"" jump down from a high ledge, come out behind a weird corner, or just simply isn't where he should be, he might be a Spy.  Since Spies can't walk through you, you can tell someone is a Spy if you bump into them.
 * HEALING YOUR TEAM
   * The rate you heal teammates is dependent on how long ago they were damaged; the longer they were damaged, the quicker you'll heal them\[[10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL7Tzq168Bs)].  Therefore, if you want to heal everyone the fastest possible you should overheal one player completely before switching targets, as this will allow enough time to increase the heal rate.  Of course, if everyone is dying and/or on fire, consider quickly switching between them to keep everyone alive.
   * The preferable way to play Medic is to stick close to the bulk of your team and heal everyone, then use your Uber/Kritz on the appropriate player.  This is how you want to play if you're the only Medic on your team.
   * The other way to play is to predominantly heal one great player on your team while s/he roams around pushing the enemy back, and picking off stray enemies.  This can be a great help by thinning the enemy herd, but is better for your team if there is a second Medic on your team healing everyone else.
 * UBER/KRITZ CHARGING
   * Your Uber/Krit charges at maximum speed during setup time.  The exception to this is when you're healing someone being healed by a secondary source, such as another Medic, a dispenser, or the payload cart, where it will be noticeably slower.
   * During regular play your Uber/Kritz charges at maximum speed when you heal damaged players or overheal healthy players to 150% of their health\[[11](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2afZ9xiSSZs)].  It takes twice as long to get a full charge if you keep overhealing one player and four times as long if you're healing someone being healed by a secondary source, such as another Medic, a dispenser, or payload cart.  This is why you should always try to heal and overheal everyone during play.
   * If you're building up an Uber/Kritz, consider asking a Demoman or Soldier to damage themselves while you heal them to build up your charge at its fastest pace.
 * UBER/KRITZ USAGE
   * When taking out a sentry with an Ubercharge *always* run ahead of your patient so the sentry fires at you first.  The bullets and rockets will knock you back, but your patient can now get in close and destroy the sentry\[[12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwrKFmKCCc4)].  If you don't run ahead, the knockback may keep your patient from doing any damage at all\[[13](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9mzraXIw7E#t=0m56s)].  Never jump, though, or you'll waste your Uber by being blasted across the map.
   * Uber Demomen should be your first choice to take out a sentry nest\[[3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I)], with second choice probably being an Uber Pyro\[[12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwrKFmKCCc4)].
   * Good targets for Ubercharges are [Demomen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcfJbQQN76I), [Pyros](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pd8nEW8lPv0), and [Heavies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmd8rzvmDkU#t=0m50s).  Good targets for Kritzcharges are [Demomen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzuFo9k5wpw), [Soldiers](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GMVkZXq_So), and [Heavies](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxzYPkRt_f4).  Kritzcharged Pyros can work decently well, too, if you ambush a group of enemies who aren't protected by a sentry\[[14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWfPHcRrFPY)].  In general, while you should heal everyone, Demomen, Heavies, Pyros, and Soldiers make great classes to buddy up with during a battle.
   * If you're being attacked and have a full charge, always use it before you lose it.  At worst, you'll still die, but at best, you'll survive and possibly have done some damage.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_a4h1r,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/a4h1r/medic_tips/,

***A Few Words About the Pyro:***

The pyro is a heavily mechanic reliant class.  In order to get the most out of the pyro class, you need to understand their mechanics to a relatively strong degree.  This includes their load out options, as many of their best abilities rely on certain weapons and load out combinations.

Let me start with their weapons, then combinations and tactics using those.

**Primary Weapons:**

* *The Flame Thrower(Stock)* : Standard flame thrower. Burns things, sets things on fire, can use compression blasts at 20 fuel per blast.

* *The Degreaser:* 65% faster weapon switch time, less damage caused by afterburn effects, can use compression blasts at 20 fuel per blast.

* *The Back Burner*: 10% more damage, 100% critical chance from behind, costs 50(1/4th of your ammo) fuel to use compression blast.


**Secondary Weapons:**

* *The Shotgun(Stock)*: Standard shotgun, great for medium ranged combat.  Best secondary weapon for dealing with enemy pyros. (2 successive hits at close range will kill most classes), the only ranged weapon available for underwater combat for the pyro.

* *The Flaregun*: Long ranged fire-starter.  Always crits for 90 damage against players who are already on fire. (2 successive hits + afterburn will kill most classes), applies an afterburn on par with the stock Flame Thrower's afterburn.

* *The Detonator*: Long ranged, splash based fire-starter.  Always mini-crits burning targets.  Good for panicking clusters of enemies, or igniting players using corners as cover.

**Melee Weapons**:

* *The Fire Axe(Stock)*: Standard axe.  Kills things, specifically people.

* *The Axtinguisher*: 50% less damage against targets that aren't burning.  Always crits against players that are burning(195 damage).

* *The Rake*: You cannot be healed as quickly by medics, but health packs restore considerably more.

* *The Powerjack*: Enemies killed with the Powerjack restore 75 health to you.

* *The Homewrecker*: Removes enemy sappers from buildings and causes additional damage to enemy buildings.

***Load Out #1:  Puff and Stinger***

Primary: The Degreaser

Secondary: Flare Gun

Melee: Axtinguisher.

This load out selection makes use of the rapid swap time on the degreaser in combination with two weapons that always critical against burning targets.  This load out focuses on aggressive pursuit of isolated enemy players(both directly, and through ambushes), and maintains the frequency of life-saving air blasts.  This load out is very effective for both offense and defense.

***Puff and Stinger Tactics:***

**The Standard Puff and Sting**

This technique is simple, yet brutally effective.  Against any player you are in close quarters with, set them on fire with a 'Puff' of your flame thrower, swap to your melee weapon(which should be your axtinguisher), and strike your enemy.  **This 1.5 second to 2 second move will kill anyone it hits**, except the heavy and anyone with an overheal.  It kills the heavy and anyone with an overheal in 2 hits.  It kills an overhealed heavy in 3 hits.

Note: Before someone asks, the soldier has 200 health.  The first application of fire, a tick of afterburn, and the axtinguisher hit will kill them.

**The Puff, Blast and Sting**

This is the same as the above, but is better used against classes that are faster than you(Which is just the medic and the scout), or anyone who has a reasonably good chance to escape.  Rush them, puff them once with the degreaser, then airblast them into a wall or other solid object. Close in and follow up with the axtinguisher to finish the job.

**The Hotshot**

When faced with classes who have managed to put themselves at a considerable range of you(for instance, a scout or medic running, or a demo/soldier who jumped away), follow up with a shot from your flare gun.  The flare gun's critical deals 90 damage, and the afterburn will frequently kill light classes after taking that critical hit.  It takes some time to get used to aiming the flaregun, but it is an invaluable addition to the puff and stinger's arsenal.


***Load out #2: Nestwatcher***

Primary: Flame Thrower or Degreaser

Secondary: Detonator

Melee: Homewrecker

This is primarily a defensive load out and set of tactics.  Most of these tactics can be done with any load out, but in terms of effectiveness for maintaining a defensive line, this is generally the most versatile defensive one.

**Spy Checking**

Check players with a single puff of flame from the flame thrower, sweep areas by holding your M1 button and making sure the fire tosses over every nook and cranny near your defensive point.  Run a patrol(that includes picking up ammo from dispensers) while you're on the defensive, and spies won't be able to menace your team.

If you see a spy, and he is rapidly approaching a friendly player or nest now that he's been caught, blast him away from his target, corner him and kill him.  Preventing spies from assassinating and sabotaging gear is a key to being an effective team pyro.  Do note that this might not earn you the most points in the game, but it will help ensure your team wins the game.

If a spy DOES manage to slip by, use the homewrecker to save friendly gear.

**Front-line Softening**

Using the detonator, lob fireworks into the enemy team and detonate them. The fire will panic some players and act as a deterrent to pushing a point. Use this to also menace enemy snipers to protect your team's heads.

Try to avoid close quarters combat if you're the only pyro on the team acting defensively, as it could leave your team vulnerable to spies and enemy ubers.


**Repelling Ubers and the Uber Balloon, and Juggling**

Pyros can make game changing decisions by playing more defensively. If they are alive when an enemy uber charges through, they can knock back the enemy uber with their blast, or separate the doctor from his patient, thus denying your enemy team an ubercharge.

An effective trick for handling enemy ubers is ballooning them.  This is done by blasting an enemy uber into the air while they're being fired on by a sentry.  The sentry's knockback effect will send the uber soaring away.  This also works with other forms of invulnerability, such as Bonk! for the scout.

Juggling can also be performed on enemy players. To do this, blast an enemy uber upwards continuously.  Once they are high enough, keep blasting them with air and move under them.  You can keep them airborne until you run out of ammo, or until you are killed by enemy players.  Consider using this sparingly, as your diverted attention will often get you killed by the enemy team. 

***Loadout #3:  The Lone Pyro***

Primary: The Back Burner

Secondary: Shotgun 

Melee: Powerjack or Rake


This is a very hostile load out for the pyro.  Pyros using this load out at its best are rarely found with their team.  Instead, they use flanking points, hidden teleporters and alternative paths to get behind their enemies and set up ambushes.  When the time comes, they pop out of hiding and melt their enemy team down *from behind*.

Since you are often alone when ambushing, the Powerjack or Rake can help you keep your health up.

**Effective Hiding**

Pyros should be located in nooks that players will pass, but rarely look at, or hide above and behind them on catwalks or ledges.  Take note that your flamethrower is quite long, and hiding on a corner might still reveal your flamethrower to those who are approaching it.  Once they see a flame thrower, especially a back burner, they will want to kill you with all sorts of corner spam.

**Enemy Circling**

A cornerstone of any good pyro, you should practice circling around enemies.  With the back burner, the enormous damage from burning an enemy from behind alone is worth it.  It will also help you survive against enemy heavies, as their fire is limited.

1341878890.0,64,self.NewToTF2,wasm1,The Quick-Fix. What you're doing wrong.,fauxstellata,71,7,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/wasm1/the_quickfix_what_youre_doing_wrong/,"The Quick-Fix gets a lot of hate on Reddit (and everywhere else) but it can be used effectively.

This post is not aimed at people who are convinced ""Stock is always best hurr durr"". It's for those who are already using it or are considering using it.

First off, why are you using the Quick-Fix? If the answer is ""because I just got it as an unlock, so it must be better"" or ""because it says it heals faster"" then stop. Right now, go take that thing off. Using this weapon without understanding what it does is bad. It is not your normal Medigun, don't treat it that way and expect it to work.

If you want to use this weapon, a good reason would be either ""My team are taking so much damage that I cannot overheal anybody without letting someone else die"" or even ""My team are not using my Ubercharge to push but seem to be able to slow push/soft push"".   *(Pushing without Ubercharge, as opposed to a fast push/hard push where Ubered people just run in)*

If you're thinking ""Well I keep dying before I get Uber anyway.. I'll use it"" then stop again. Take it off, go and get better at avoiding damage and staying alive. The Quick-Fix can help you be on the front line more often, but you shouldn't learn how to Medic using it. It will become a crutch that way.

**Right, let's start:**

First off, note that this Medigun does not overheal, and builds its charge at the rate of the Kritzkrieg.

The Kritzkrieg charges at 3.125%/sec if the targets HP is below 142.5% (nearly fully overhealed) and 1.56%/sec if the targets HP is above 142.5%. 

The Quick-Fix has the exact same charge numbers but does not overheal, meaning that you will always be charging at 3.125%/sec, which guarantees that you will have 100% charge after 32 seconds of continuous healing. If you end up stuck with one teammate (just respawned/push gone wrong), he will not have to weaken himself to build faster.

**Which brings me onto the first misconception with this weapon: ""You should only use it if there is another Medic on your team"". This is false. If another player switches to Medic, stop using the Quick-Fix.**

Why? Two reasons. First off, another Medic slows your charge rate down. The charge rate is already slowed if two Medics heal the same player, but now that player will be overhealed, pushing you back onto that 1.56% rate, which will be halved again if you share a patient. 

Secondly because another Medic makes the Quick-Fix redundant. You went Quick-Fix because you need more immediate healing. That +40% is now overshadowed by the +100% that other Medic is bringing in. Using the Quick-Fix when there is enough healing to go ahead is useless. Switch so you can provide overheals and a Ubercharge/Kritzkrieg.

The Quick-Fix allows ONE Medic to patch up his team faster than he would normally be able to. Once there are TWO Medics, they do not need to do faster, they can afford to do it well.

The other misconception is that the Megaheal is useless. You should **stop using it like an Ubercharge.** The Megaheal is just a period where you heal your patient for 100HP/second and are immune to knockback, as well as healing yourself. Think of it that way.

The Megaheal can help you mid-push once your team starts to weaken, but that's not it's only use. You should pop it:

* Whenever you are weak. Don't sit there at 50HP. Pop the Megaheal and get back to 150.
* If your patient is under attack and might die. (This is probably the most ""Ubercharge""-ish way)
* Two or more high-health teammates are weak, even if there are no enemies nearby. It's better to have your whole team healed all the time, just in case someone bombs in.
* You or your patient are standing on their point. The Megaheal does not stop you from capturing.

You can twist this to your own ends even. I once popped on a 10HP Soldier who was fleeing an important fight, before spreading the rest of the Megaheal around my team, just so he could turn around and get back into the game. Bear in mind that your patients keep that health after the Megaheal finishes (as opposed to Ubercharge patients who lose their invulnerability) so you can use it solely as a period of increased healing power and still be effective.

Your Megaheal charges every 32 seconds on the dot, and that's your big advantage. Use it every chance you get. While you cannot break a stalemate like the Medigun/Kritzkrieg can, you can provide support for a constant slow push, eliminating the need for the stalemate-breaker in the first place.

Remember you are not invulnerable though. Headshots, backstabs, critical hits and burst damage (focus-fire or stickies) WILL out-DPS your healing or kill you. While you can pop Ubercharge to save yourself, the Megaheal will only heal you and then only if you have a patient. 

Also remember that the other Medigun's charges have advantages over yours (Ubercharge cannot be killed by focus-fire/crits like the Megaheal can. Kritzkrieg will kill you) to counter the fact that you charge so damn quick.

Having said that, have some balls, a Megahealed Heavy on the point is damn hard to shift, especially as he is immune to airblast.

That was longer than I expected it to be, so thank you if you actually read it. Doubtless I've forgotten something, so feel free to point out any blunders.

**TL;DR - Medic-jumping.**

This is a list of the servers we recommend spending some time on.  These servers have varied average skill levels, ranging from barely skilled at all to ""You-might-as-well-stay-in-the-spawn"" skilled.  Game mods and map *types* will be listed next to each server.

In order to add these servers to your favorites, click on 'Browse Servers' button in the main menu, then click on the 'Favorites' tab in the following window.  At the bottom right hand corner, there will be an option to 'Add a Server.'   To add these servers, **copy and paste their IP addresses and ports** into the window that comes up, then click ""Add""

An IP address with a port looks like this:  **74.207.237.53:27015**

You may also use a web address in place of some IP addresses:  **east.extelevision.com:27015**

**Entry Level**

**Valve Sponsored Servers**

Valve sponsored servers are 24 population(12 on a team) servers of several varying types.  Most of them rotate 3-4 maps from the stock selection.  You will find mostly novice players, with the occasional intermediate to advanced players popping in.  These are a great place to start for getting the basics of *your class* down.  Do not expect much in the way of teamwork, as coordination is fairly rare on these servers.

Since Valve servers are as varied as people that play TF2, I cannot recommend favoriting them.  The communities they support are liquid and fickle.

**Beginner to Intermediate**

----

**Reddit, Dirty South**:  

A moderately skilled environment attached to the Reddit R/TF2 community. Server is run on vanilla settings and is admined by members of the Reddit community. Runs Stock and Community made maps.  If you would like to see the other reddit servers, [check out this post from R/TF2](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/ic72n/a_detailed_uptodate_guide_to_reddit_tf2_servers/).

IP/Port: **74.207.237.53:27015**

**Ponyville, Friendship is Alltalk.**

This is an early intermediate, late beginner stage community, speckled with a few advanced players.   The community is friendly, but expect to be playing with a mix of young(&lt;18)  and older players.  This server rotates an enormous variety of maps, both custom and stock from various game modes(including medieval and Tug o' War).  The server's population(24-12/12) is low during mid-day, but picks up in the afternoon/evening.  As the name suggests, the server is All Talk and has a My Little Pony theme to it, including in-game sounds and sprays.  The server is family friendly and is regularly tended by an admin.

It never occurred to me that people were killing me because I let them.  They weren't getting lucky, and it wasn't ""wrong place, wrong time"".  There are no victims in TF2.  Every time you die, you *were* asking for it.  

That's the hard part.  The simple part is...that thing that got you killed?  Don't do that anymore.  Spy using cheap tactics to kill you right out of spawn?  Start watching your back.  Pyros seem to have a 6th sense for seeing through your disguises?  You're being obvious.  Demos destroying every single nest you build?  Build them someplace else.

A few reasons why playing Medic as a noob is a great idea

* You'll learn the maps.  Being a Medic involves a lot of following players around.  They'll show you ins and outs of a lot of maps.  You'll learn where choke points and common sentry positions tend to be

* You'll be helping the team and getting a sense of purpose.  The worst part about starting TF2 for me was feeling like I was being completely useless, or worse: screwing things up.  As Medic, people are constantly in need of your help, and it's easy to give them a boost.  They'll thank you for it.  You'll always feel productive, and the sense of teamwork will build.  This confidence helped me out a lot when I first started. 

* It's very rewarding and lots of fun. Almost all teams need more Medics, especially these days since the F2Ps seem to play Medic less.  Your team is going to start winning once you start playing Medic, and it will feel great.  Not only that, but if you're a strategic type, you'll have a blast playing Medic.  Commanding teammates around, being the key to a major push, blasting through a half dozen enemies at once: it's way more fun than you'll probably be having as other classes.  

Now, I'm not saying Medic the ""noob class"" by any means: playing Medic well is actually incredibly challenging.  But even someone playing Medic for the first time will help out, learn a ton, and have a great time.  It's really the best advice I can give.

Once you get to know the maps and the strategy by playing Medic, trying out other classes seems a lot less daunting.  You'll be tearing up the field in no time! ",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_ig4me,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ig4me/my_advice_to_all_novice_players_play_medic/,

If you follow these few helpful tips, not only will your Engineers love you, you will be a real team player.

* **UPGRADE THE TELEPORTER** : At the beginning of a match, my main objectives as an engie are to get my teleporter up and running, get a dispenser set up in a prime location for my team to use, and then get my sentry set up and upgraded. I only have 1 minute to do all this in. So I'll drop my entrance at spawn, refill my metal, then head to the front to get my dispenser and exit set up. What you can do to be incredibly helpful to me, and your team, is to switch to engie, upgrade my teleporter to level 3 for me, then switch to what you were going to play as in the first place. By the time it is fully upgraded, I will probably have the exit built, so you can take it to the front lines!

* **HELP PROTECT MY STUFF** : Sometimes, those pesky spies sneak past me and stab me in the back. Sometimes, those snipers can get a good angle and take me out. Once that happens, all of my gear will shortly be sapped, or sniped bit by bit into oblivion. If the spy gets all my stuff with sappers, please try your best to avenge me. It'll help keep him off my back while I'm trying to rebuild. If I get sniped, I'll tell you where the sniper is. Try to put pressure on him to keep him from killing my stuff. If there truly is nothing you could have done to save my gear, I won't feel bad about it. But if I see you just standing there looking at it, and not doing something about it while it gets blown up, don't expect me to feel sorry for you when you die and have to walk to the front from spawn.

* **BE PATIENT** : I can't tell you how many times people who have stood by and allowed my teleporter to be destroyed get annoyed at ME when there is no longer a teleporter for them to take. If my nest gets taken out, it'll take me at least a full minute to get a fully upgraded teleporter up and running again without assistance. Then another good 45 seconds or so for me to scrounge up enough metal to get a dispenser back up and running. And only then can I start building a sentry. So give me a minute, I'll try my absolute best to get my gear up as fast as I can. Until then, protect me please!

* **LOVE YOUR ENGINEER** : A good engineer is like a good bass player. You'll never think to thank him. Most of the time you'll take him for granted. Half the time you won't even realize he's there. But he can be the driving force that holds everything together, but without support he will quickly fall appart. A good engineer is vital for keeping the pressure on, both on offence and defense. You'll take that teleporter and think, ""Great, now I can get back into the fight!"" Once you get shot up, you'll come running back to my dispenser and think, ""Man, I'm sure glad this is here! Now I can get full health and ammo and return to the fray!"" Once the enemy starts pushing hard, you can fall back and my sentry will be there to help hold the line and you'll think, ""Haha, with that covering fire we can finally kill these off-colored bastards!"" But never once will you think about the engineer that made all of this possible. So show us some love, and we'll keep giving you all the support. 

***EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT***

Since this thread has gotten a lot of love, I guess its only right I put in some tips for budding engineers out there, not just for their team mates.

* **KNOW YOUR SURROUNDINGS** : This one will come more with time and experience. As an engineer, you won't really be doing front line fighting, more choke point holding and rush supression. That means you need to know all the angles an enemy force can attack from. Usually on most areas there are 2-3 ways an enemy can come. Know which path most people will take (usually right up the middle), and which path the spies and ambushers are likely to take (either the high, low, or side road; something that gives them a lot of cover). A prime example of this is 2nd area on Gold Rush, first cap area. Most people will fight along the cart path, right up the middle. But there is a little tunnel off to the left (from the attacker's perspective) that most spies and sneaky scouts will love to take to get behind you. Try to position your sentry to cover both of these routes. I particularly like the platform across the small ravine so my sentry will cover the cart and a ton of area around it, and I can wrangle it easily to take out people going through the tunnel.

* **FLY YOU FOOLS** : One thing almost all inexperienced engineers do is try to salvage a hopeless situation. 2 heavies with a medic are charging your position, a demo is laying stickes all around your feet, and you just heard a spy decloak behind you. A bad engineer will stay with his gear, only to get blown to smithereens, riddled with bullets, and a knife in the back for good measure. A good engie will *get the hell out of there*. You're much more valuabe to your team alive than dead. If you make it out alive, you can start setting up your next base that much sooner instead of waiting to respawn and walk all the way there.

Something I like to do is if a demo is laying down stickies right in front of my sentry, I'll pick it up, walk back a little bit, set it down out of range of the stickies, then go after the demo with my shotgun while the sentry rebuilds. But I only go after him just long enough to get the sentry back up, not to hunt him down and kill him. Once the sentry is back up and I chase him off, I'm good to go for a little while. The main goal was to save my sentry so I won't have to rebuild it.

* **HELP YOUR FELLOW ENGIES** : I once played a game with 3 engineers in it. I set up my gear in a prime location, and my fellows were perfectly scattered around to cover all routes with at least 2 sentries giving cross fire. But those pesky spies got past them and managed to kill me and sap my gear. I immediately let my fellow engies know what happened, but either they didn't care, or they didn't hear me. Either way, all my gear was destroyed when it could have easily been taken care of by nearby engies. Later in that match, the same thing happened to one of the other engies. I saw him go down and the spy sap all of this stuff. So I ran over and saved his dispenser and sentry before the sappers took out his teleporter. He got back to the front lines and only had to drop his exit before he was good to go, whereas I had to completely rebuild everything.

* **PUT YOUR GEAR TO HELP YOUR TEAM** : I can't count how many times I've seen an engineer up high in a building with his sentry covering a walk way and has all of his gear up there as well. That's fine for him, but not really helpful for the team. Since he's in that building, most classes will have a hard time doing high amounts of damage to his sentry, so he really won't need a whole lot of metal to keep it up. If thats the case, where your sentry has some good cover, put your dispenser down lower where your team mates can get at it easier. They'll appreciate it more than having to trek up to your nest, then haul it back down for 3 seconds of healing and ammo pickup. Or build your nest closer to the action to really keep the enemy back.

Starting to hate that word, really.

I'm a writer, and this is long.

Sorry that I have not been more attentive with what's been going on.  A family member has recently passed and, as a result, I've been left with a much larger(and frankly more important) task that occupies most of my free time.

To give a history of our sudden removal of Gentlemann's Estate from my perspective (since I'm sure all of you are wondering, since I was practically a fan-boy of the server, now I avoid talking about it.)

This ordeal started when I caught a glimpse of the Gentlemann's Estate post in /R/TF2.  As some of you know, I'm a pretty light-hearted guy when it comes to looking for a server to play on(One of my favorite servers are the Ponyvillie servers.)  When I saw a server that matched the basic ideas that I had for game-play (The Gentleman's Code, for those that remember,) I decided to get behind it.

Seeing that the server was getting off the ground, I, in a mild euphoric state, decided to use my position as a NewtoTF2 Mod to garner attention for the server.  This is something that I realize now that I ***should not*** have done.  Aside from being largely off-topic for our community, it was an abuse of position that Lapper has been a friend, and thus kind enough not to point out.

As members of our community reviewed and played on the server, I decided to chip in a bit more.  As some of you might remember, I donated roughly a month's cost of the server($48~ something), and made my offer to be an admin official, since it would put me in a more direct position of interacting with you guys.

If you guys didn't know it, I love you.  I love the game, and this community has always managed to surprise me in so many pleasant ways.

Coming off of my tangent, Delta confided in me that he was having problems with his current(Then, Bud and Wiggs) admins, stating that they were bossing him around, despite him being in direct ownership of the server.  I stated the obvious, citing the Golden Rule(Whoever has the gold makes the rules.)  I recommended that, if he felt the admins were a problem, he should ask them to take lesser duties or offer to let them step down gracefully.

Instead, he decided to 'Black Bag' them, by stripping away their admin status on the server, banning them from the subreddit, and silencing anyone else who tried to argue the opposite.  In addition, he posted a copy/paste of an unflattering conversation pulled out of context(of which the context could not be verified.)

**That was strike number one, but I chalked it up to a stressed out new-server owner.**

During our conversations, I asked him about the financial state of the server.  I had problems personally endorising a server that I would not see my community being able to play on in a month.  He told me that he  had $1200 separated into two accounts.

**This was strike number two.**

How did he manage to pull in so much money for these accounts, despite the server being up for such a little time?   Delta was clearly not  new to the server ownership business, and therefore couldn't have been inexperienced with being in a position of power over admins of a server.

Since I couldn't verify the source of the funds, or why they were separated, I gave him the benefit of the doubt and assumed it was his personal investment.

When I eventually did become an admin, I realized that I simply didn't have the time to really put in quality service to the server.  I played during non-peak times, and was rarely on with many other admins.  When I told Delta this, he didn't seem bothered by it.

**This was strike number three.**  

Why did Delta not care about the productivity of his admins?  If not all admins, why was I excused?  It became clear that keeping my favor was the only thing of his interest, since I was urging NewtoTF2 to visit the server and contribute.

I went back to my roots(and my Recommended Server Checklist), with the enchantment dispelled.  The server only matched a handful of things, and failed on so many others.  Not only was I in favor of this server, I was actively endorsing a server that didn't meet my own standard.  My criticism grew sharp.  

And to my surprise, mine wasn't the only one.  

I continued to give Delta the benefit of the doubt, since I had nothing conclusive pointing out his server was a scam.  As a writer, mentor, and having been mentored myself in the past, I know that the best way to improve is in harsh environments.  I criticized *everything* I saw wrong with the server, from the slot allotment, to the donation pandering..

**..By the way, donation pandering was strike four...**

... pulling the community off Reddit and onto a personal website...

**... Strike five...**

... the pay-to-win donation benefits(which was repealed due to the massive criticism from this community, which I am incredibly proud of)...

**... Strike six ...**

... refusing to allow the community to moderate itself(Votekick/Voteban/VoteScramble, authoritarian grip on the subreddit) ...

**... Strike seven(Game) and eight(Subreddit) ...**

... 32 slots plugin which kept ""breaking"" ...

**... Strike Nine ...**

... an SQL server that was hacked, and that he couldn't fix for me, despite it being fixed for everyone else ...

**... Strike Ten(For the SQL-inject if true) and Eleven(For lying about not being able to fix it)...**


I had ***ELEVEN*** reasons not to play there, let alone endorse the server.    I had more, because once Lapper talked to me about being a server admin on it, and one of our community supporters(Assp) talked to, the way these two members of our community were treated.  Not only that, but I noticed donation goals being reset *constantly*, putting the server in a perpetual 'Donation Drive' mode, despite there being well over a year's worth of donations in the buffer.

This is when my family member passed; I was in no position to make a rational argument to the community about it, despite my findings and observations.  My head wasn't in the right place, and grief is hard to think through.   It was rather fortunate that Lapper maintained interest in the server, because it would be a conversation between he and someone within the server that made him cut the connection.(Something I should have done 8 strikes prior.)

As I was leaving, he(Delta) decided to implement a 'No bitching rule.""  I told him that he was walking down an extremely dangerous path.  He dismissed me.  I asked him about the money, and how to run a server.  He became extremely defensive.  I haven't talked to him or been in the server since.


**tl;dr It was a absolutely a scam, and I was urging people that trusted me into it.  Lapper stepped up and stopped it, he speaks for me in my intermittent absence.  If I don't step down after this, expect me to be quite a bit stricter on server owners/admins, and a lot less trusting of new ventures.**",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_sao75,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/sao75/regarding_the_gentlemann_server_and_myself/,moderator

So if you see an engineer in his nest, overheal him, because he'll hold onto those 60 extra health points! And if your teammates are pushing the cart, go out of your way to overheal them, because they're going to be shot at quite a bit, and it can make all the difference.

I just thought I'd point this out, because it's not immediately obvious, and can be very very useful.

* Has 150 health and is considered a light class.

* Moves at 100% speed, and is slower only than the medic and scout.

* Can build Teleporters and Dispensers to provide transportation and health to allies like his traditional cousin.

* Has predictable melee crits with his melee weapon, using 3 hit combo system.

* Builds low-profile, low cost, high speed and fast building mini-sentries that have a wide variety of defensive and offensive uses.

* Very reliant on aiming spray based and single-shot based hitscan weapons, much like the scout.


**Their roles in a team are...**

* Direct front-line support.

* Offensive flanking.

* Area control and Visual Deterrence

* Providing support fire for front-liners

* Exploiting opportunities or weaknesses in enemy defense.

* Supporting friendly engineers with building or repairing buildings.

* Providing extensive dialogue about how much he loves his little gun.

**They excel at...**

* Fighting enemy light classes and pyros

* Keeping front-line allies in the fight longer.

* Assisting friendly players in direct front-line combat.

* Raising team combat awareness.

**They are vulnerable to...**

* Snipers. Despite their new found freedom, a fully charged body shot can be lethal to a Gunslinger engineer.

* Soldiers. While soldiers can easily be distracted by mini-sentries, rockets deal a rather large chunk of damage to gunslingers

* Demomen. Their high explosive capacity makes it somewhat challenging for Gunslingers to effectively distract demomen.

* Heavies. The high health pool and high rate of fire sported by the heavy makes him the hardest thing for a Gunslinger to tackle alone.


**A few words on the Gunslinger Engineer...**

The Gunslinger Engineer requires a very different play style from the traditional engineer. The mini-sentries make it impossible to establish the same stopping force that the traditional engineer has, but enables a run-and-gun style of play for the Gunslinger. I highly recommend making fast-build aliases using the CFG files, for every second counts when you stare into the eyes of an angry bull.

***You MUST have a Gunslinger wrench in order to play as a Gunslinger Engineer. You can receive one as an achievement item by completing 11 Engineer Achievements.*** 

On to the guide.

-----

**The Setup**

As an engineer, you should still uphold your duties to establish a teleporter and dispenser to your team early on. If you are not the only engineer on the team, consider placing your teleporter exit with the other engineer's gear.

The dispenser should be put in a covered place in or close to the front line, where front-liners can quickly recover and replenish their ammo, and get right back into the fight without needing to retreat further back to reach the other engineer. Also use this as a source of metal for your building upgrades and mini-sentries.

-----

**The Shotgun**

Gunslingers rely more on their primary and secondary weapons more than their traditional cousins, their shotguns especially. The shotgun, despite it being a secondary weapon for 3 classes, is deceptively powerful.


**2 full(10 pellets) shots or 1 critical of the shotgun will kill ALL of the following in close range:**

* Demoman
* Pyros
* Medics
* Snipers
* Engineers
* Scouts
* Spies

**3 shots(1 crit + 1 shot) will kill...**

* Anyone above with an overheal

* Soldiers

**4 shots(2 crits, or 1 crit + 2 shots) will kill...**

* Heavies 

* Overhealed Soldiers

**5 shots (2+ crits + 1 shot, or 1 crit + 3 shots) will kill an over healed heavy.**

-----

***The Side Arm*** 

The Pistol is often the best weapon for the Gunslinger engineer, due to its high rate of fire, fast reload and enormous ammo reserve. At close range, the pistol is extremely dangerous, but it really shines when it is used against weakened players that are fleeing, or while you are fleeing.

**Close range shots deal 22 damage per shot**.  7 shots will kill light classes. A full clip will kill everyone but the heavy.

**At medium range the pistol deals 13 to 17 damage**, which still makes it a fairly dangerous weapon, and great for finishing weakened enemies.

**At maximum range, the pistol deals (at worst) 8 points of damage** per hit.  This can finish off fleeing enemies if they're weakened enough, and if you can land enough shots.


The Wrangler and Short Circuit are other options for secondaries, though the Short Circuit's metal eating attack tends to be counter-productive to the many uses of mini-sentries. The Wrangler can be used to attack very distant targets(Such as enemy sentries), though the Wrangler's high visibility tends to make you a prime target for enemy fire. Keeping the Mini-sentry low profile is often best.

-----

***The Mini-Sentry Overview***

* You can still only build one sentry at a time.

* Costs **100 metal to create**(Full metal allows you to create two sentries)

* Comes out of its toolbox with full health(**100 health**), unlike its regular cousins.

* Fires 50% faster than a level 1 sentry, but does half the damage per shot.

* Deals **8 damage per hit**, and fires at a rate of **6 shots per second.** (**48 damage per second** while within its range) 

* Enemies in the mini-sentry's firing range may experience trouble aiming due to the constant, rapid stream of small knock backs.

* The mini-sentry cannot be repaired or upgraded.

* Collecting enemy weapons causes engineers to gain 100 metal, which makes it easy to equate 1 kill = 1 extra sentry while in the fight.

-----

***Ways to use the sentry...***

**Offensively**

* **The Snake in the Grass** - Hidden/Ambushing Sentry

Placing hidden sentries at the flanks or rear of enemies can allow for a quick, early set of kills.  **Use visual elements, corners, piles of boxes, barrels, water, high window lips and other various map features to hide your mini-sentry from early detection.**  

Similar to that other snake in the grass(The Spy), the more your enemy expects your little mechanical ninja, the more likely it is to die trying to sneak attack enemies.


* **The Red Herring** - Distraction

Gunslingers should be able to flick down a mini-sentry in the blink of an eye.  While you're in the fray of battle, drop a mini-sentry(you made that build alias in your CFG file, right?) **and get away from it.**  Enemies with more limited ammo reserves(For example, Black Box or Liberty Launcher Soldiers, Demomen with shields) will frequently exhaust a good bit of their ammo against your sentry.  

**Approach while they have limited or no loaded ammo and feed them some of the good stuff from your shotgun or pistol. **

This is also very effective against pyros, though you need to continue to run from them as you drop it.  If they stop to destroy your sentry with their flame thrower, keep a moderate distance and either use the pistol to ramp up the damage, or try to burst the pyro down with the shotgun.  

Pyros tend to be relatively easy kills to make as a gunslinger, since they often have to run face first into a mini-sentry to kill it.


* **The Wild Goose Chase** - Damage Source Confusion

If you can get your sentry in a high or hidden places, and do the likewise for yourself, combine your pistol's fire with your sentry's fire.  The staggering caused by the mini-sentry and the multiple directions of damage can confuse some players.  While not always a lethal technique, it is devastating to light classes who spend too long trying to figure out what's going on(48 DPS + your pistol shots is quite a bit of damage to them)

-----

**Defensively **

* **The Canary** - Incoming/Flank Alarm

Placing your mini-sentry in crucial flanking areas(For instance, far flanks that have the ability to out-range second-line defending sentries, or areas that can access the rear of your front line) can serve to alert you and your team of potential enemies coming that direction.  Be sure to communicate to your team using either your Mic or voice commands that someone is on their way.

If someone destroys your sentry, look at the kill icon, and it will tell you what class it is, and what you can expect when you go to investigate.  Relaying that to your team is helpful.  

Spies also seem to love sapping these things.  Don't bother trying to save it, just hunt down the spy and make sure you collect his weapon to pay for the damages.

* **The Watchdog** - Visual Deterrence

A bold, but frequently questioned application of the mini-sentry is out in the open, in front of objectives.  This will deter light classes(and warn of spies if sapped) from capturing objectives in the absence of the larger force of your team.  If a light class is bold enough to approach it without shooting it down, they will feel this tiny pup's bite.

Hardier classes will have less problems dealing with it, but that's why you have 200 metal and a shotgun, partner.

* **The Lizard's Tail** - Sacrificial Escape

**When you're up to your cowboy boots in hot water, saddle up a sentry and run like a pony that hasn't made jarate in a week.**

In other words, if you find yourself out matched or out numbered, drop your sentry and run.   If your aggressors choose to ignore the sentry, they'll suffer considerable damage while they chase you.  If they choose to kill it, that's a few shots they can't use against you, and a few more seconds to get away.  

This is particularly good with snipers that camp specific lines of sight.  Drop a mini-sentry in their line of sight(preferably while in cover) and wait until he shoots it.  The sniper has a relatively long reload on his sniper rifle, which(hopefully) will allow you to run and duck into cover again elsewhere.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_k5mv5,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/k5mv5/dont_test_my_mettle_son_a_guide_to_gunslinger/,

**A few words on the Soldier...**

The soldier is a well rounded offensive minded class.  They excel in nearly all forms of combat(except melee, and it's still 'decent').  New players would do well to learn the Soldier relatively early, since it is one of the few classes that is both easy to start with, and becomes increasingly better the more experience you have with the class.

Their immense load out versatility makes them one of the most flexible classes in the game.  While the majority of their unlocks are still offensive minded, they can also adopt defensive and supportive roles by alternating their secondary weapons.

On to the guide.


**The Soldier's Rockets**


The primary weapon of the soldier is his prized rocket launcher.  This weapon is a **straight firing** death machine. The rocket launcher, in close combat, can deal an enormous **112 points of damage**.  Using it in close combat is rarely advised, since **the explosion can also hurt you** if they're too close.  (You take less damage from your own explosives, though.)

**In mid and long range fights is where the soldier's rockets shine.**  While it is true that they deal reduced damage to more distant targets, the ability to fire multiple rockets into distant crowded areas makes the soldier a threat regardless of where he fires from.  A soldier hitting a distant target with his rockets will normally only deal about **48-60 damage**.  A soldier's **stock rocket launcher can fire off 4 of these**.  If aimed well, or aimed against a stationary or slow target, you can easily rack up **192-240 in a full load**.   This is useful for **softening up enemies** before a full team push, or **discouraging players from pushing**.



**Crockets**

The rocket launcher's criticals(AKA Crockets) deal enormous damage to people caught in their blast radius, up to 270 with the stock rocket launcher.  Crockets will kill **any player, except for The Heavy or an overhealed soldier**.  Follow up rockets will finish off either of those two classes.  

If you're out of rockets(or against a pyro, which I'll talk about later), you could also use...



**The Shotgun**


Some swear by it.  Others live and die by it.  The shotgun is used by 4 different classes(Heavy, Engineer, Pyro and Soldier, if you're curious), and it doesn't change in between them.  **A full meatshot**(All of the pellets hit) with the shotgun causes roughly **90 damage** and is often the demise of players who get too weak near, or too close to the soldier.   

The shotgun, unlike the rocket launcher, is significantly less useful in ranged combat, bringing in **a meager 3 points of damage per pellet** at a distance.



**Melee**  


They have it.  It works, but it isn't much special without deviating from their stock loadout(Which I'll talk about later)



On to the tricks.




***Rocket Jumping***

Rocket jumping is a fundamental skill of any soldier.  It allows soldiers to reach areas they otherwise wouldn't be able to on foot or by jumping, and also lets them do it faster, either by cutting the distance they need to walk, or by various *roll out* techniques to propel them to the front line.

To perform a basic rocket jump, you merely need to aim at your feet with your rocket launcher and fire.  Tada, basic rocket jump.

You probably didn't go very far just doing that, though.  There are ways to modify your jump based on a couple of key things.  I wrote a guide about how explosion jumping works in the game in response to a request for sticky jumping.  Read it [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/jrom1/i_write_tf2_guides_ama/c2eomsf).

If you're not interested in the full details, here are a couple quick tips.

* Rocket jumping injures you.  Before attempting any jump, make sure you have the health to survive it.  Also, falling hurts you as well.  Keep both in mind.
* Jump and crouch as you fire the rocket at your feet, and it will increase how far and how fast you travel.
* Firing rockets varying degrees behind you will cause you to travel more forward and less upwards.  Use this to limit your fall damage, or to span gaps in the map.
* You can fire rockets against walls while jumping and crouching to send you flying away from the wall. Use this, in the company of a friendly medic or near health packs, to get to the front lines more quickly. 
* Use these basic techniques to get into high or unusual places to attack from, especially when those places give you easy access to health or ammo.
* Always look before you rocket jump.  You might be jumping to your death.
* Rocket jumps can be useful for bombarding enemies, even if your destination isn't that high or far away.  Use this to get the *drop* on enemies.
* Don't forget that rocket jumps aren't just for use for attacking enemies.  You can also use it to flee to safety, or reach health/ammo more quickly.

For new players, it can be a bit confusing.

**What are binds?**: Binds(aka keybinds) are your controls. This word is generally used by people who are talking about customizing their controls.

**What are aliases?**: Aliases are, in TF2, a way to rename specific actions.  Don't worry too much about this now, I promise I'll cover it later.

**What are CFGs?**: CFGs are also known as configuration files. They use a simple, special ""language"" to set certain options for you ""on the fly.""

Moving on.

**The Benefits of Custom Keybinds.**

* Reduced (human) error when performing certain tasks.
* Faster response time/less (human) hesitation
* Flexible to anyone's play style or favorite class.
* Simplifies communication for players who do not own a mic.


**A few words on custom keybinds...**

Custom keybinds allow players to simplify tasks using CFG files.  Players that utilize these features often find that their controls are more intuitive and will fit their play style far closer than the original controls.  While creating custom keybinds isn't for everyone , they can be fitted to almost anyone's preferences.

-------

***Getting started***

First, lets get in the place where all the magic happens.  I want you navigate to..

For you oldschool 32bitters...

**""C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\(YOURUSERNAME)\team fortress 2\tf\cfg""**

or for you stylin' 64bit users...

**C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\(YOURUSERNAME)\team fortress 2\tf\cfg**


This is your config folder and contains, as you probably have noticed if you're following along, a CFG file for every class in the game.

You can open and edit these files using notepad.  If you've never done this before, they're probably empty.  I'm going to teach you how to make a keybind config.

The language is simple.  There are a few basics you need to know to complete this.

**Commands**

* **Bind**  

This command is the key(Hur) of everything.  Its syntax(how it is written to work in a cfg file) looks like this.

&gt;**Bind ""(Name of Key)"" ""(Command to use when the key when pressed"")**

Here's a real life example:

&gt;**Bind ""Mouse1"" ""+attack""**

This **bind** makes mouse1(That's your left mouse button) use the +attack command, which causes you to shoot/use your weapons.

*[Here's a list of your keys](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bind#Keybinds) and how they're written in the CFG file.*

* **Alias**

Told you we'd come back to this, didn't I?

An **alias** is a way of shortening a command(or more importantly, **a string of commands**) for simple insertion ind a bind or later use in the console.  **For the purpose of this guide, I will only talk about its applications when used with the bind command.**

This is the syntax:

&gt;**alias ""(A name you create)"" ""(command#1);(command#2);(command#3);(etc, etc)""**

Here's a real life example:

&gt;**alias ""GameOver"" ""slot1; taunt; wait 300; explode""**

This alias(when assigned to a button, or typed in the console) will make you swap to your #1 weapon, taunt, wait 300 frames(Which I'll cover later), and make you explode like you ate a lemon off of one of Cave Johnson's trees.


* **[Voicemenu](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bind#Voice_commands)**

Syntax:

&gt;**Voicemenu (Menu Number, 0-2) (Voice command# 0-7)**

Example:

&gt;**Voicemenu 1 1 **

This will make your character shout ""SPY!""

* **Build** and **Destroy**

Syntax:

&gt;**Build (building number)**

&gt;**Destroy (building number)**

Example:

&gt; **Build 0**

""Erecting a dispenser!""

From the TF2 wiki:

&gt; 0: Dispenser

&gt; 1: Teleporter Entrance

&gt; 2: Sentry Gun/Minisentry

&gt; 3: Teleporter Exit

These commands will, as their name suggests, build or destroy a particular building.

* **[Disguise](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bind#Quick_Spy_disguises)**

Syntax:

&gt; **Disguise (class number) (Team color number)**

Example:

&gt; **Disguise 1 -1**

This will disguise you as an enemy scout.  By the way, this is a terrible disguise, so I recommend you don't use it.    Check the link above for the rest of the list, and stick to -1 and -2 for determining your disguises, since you won't always be against the same colored team.


***Commands without Arguments***

(That's commands that don't need extra stuff after them)

* **Slot1, Slot2 and Slot3**

These commands cause your weapon to change to the respected slot.   They are represented with simply ""Slot1"", ""Slot2"" and ""Slot3"" in the cfg file.

* **+Attack, +Attack2**

Your primary and secondary fire commands.  

***A quick note about the + and - commands:***

**+** commands will continue to function until they are released with a **-** command.  When you are creating a CFG file of your own, be sure to create a - for every +, else you may be unable to stop firing or ducking or whatever it was you used it with!

* **+Duck**

Causes you to crouch.

* **Jump**

*Boing!*

If you have braved the frontiers of valve servers, you might see the signs of other communities bleeding in, but there are few games that can stand up to the sportsmanship of veteran TF2 communities.

To you, I present the Gentleman's Code: Everything you need to know about men(and women) with distinguishing hats.

* The only bad games are games that were never played.  Every game is a good game, whether you win or lose, whether by a hair or a landslide.
* There are no bad players.  There are poorly organized teams, poorly executed plans, and bad strategies, but never bad players.  
* If the team loses, the team is responsible.  If one fails, we all fail.  It is our responsibility to work together to win. 
* Even in the face of unsportsmanlike conduct, a hat connoisseur does not 'sink' to their level.  He speaks his mind, says his piece and leaves it at that.  Any action after is at the discretion of the gentleman(or lady).
* One does not 'rage-quit.'  A hat connoisseur congratulates the winning team, praises their superior teamwork, thanks them for the game, then leaves on his or her own accord.  They are not controlled by petty feelings of anger or envy, even when injustice is afoot.
* It is uncouth to demand a service without first providing one.  If there are no gentleman of the Hippocratic oath(that's Medics), the gentleman(or lady) first offers to be one when he asks of his team. (Explained in greater detail [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/jqhvd/the_gentlemans_code_the_hat_connoisseurs_guide_to/c2ebi5l))
* The gentleman(or lady) recognizes issues of fairness and seeks to rectify them, even at the cost of a winning team composition.(Scramble unfair or uneven teams, even if you're on the team with 5 stacked clanners)
* Never give up.  Even after repeated losses, deaths and slights.  The hat connoisseur knows that it is perseverance in the face of adversity that separates the mighty from the meek.
* A hat connoisseur never takes himself(or herself) too seriously.  To be able to laugh at oneself or oneself's mistakes is to have a character of real worth.


This guide was written in response to a growing concern I have had since seeing so many new faces in our games, many of them holding less than savory attitudes about their fellow players.  If you stick to this code of in-game ethics, you will meet and befriend many players, including veterans who will find it refreshing to see their old community in the eyes of bright young recruits.

See you in the game, maggots.

**wtf is spycheck?**

Spychecking is the act of checking if the guy next to you is a spy.

**kk so how do i spycheck???**

There are many ways to spycheck. There are different ways to do it. Here is a list of the most common strategies in order of easiest to hardest:

* **PYRO**: The easiest. With your flamethrower, just click on the suspect. If he catches on fire, **IT'S A SPY**. Also, I've heard that instead of going out, flaming disguised teammates blast backwards like a teammate.
* **EVERYONE**: You can't go through them. You only can go through teammates, not enemies. This is why engies put dispensers in narrow alleyways - people/spies can't get through.
* **EVERYONE**: You see a person named as your In Game Name (IGN). ***IT'S A SPY*** disguised as you.
* **EVERYONE**: They don't shoot. 
* **EVERYONE**: They die on one hit. You deal 6 damage with your shotgun, they just collapse. This may be a Dead Ringer spy, a spy who fakes death. Keep on shooting. With a Pyro, keep shooting in that distance to ignite him.
* **EVERYONE**: They move faster/slower than their class. See an abnormally slow Scout? **IT'S A SPY.** (EDIT: This only applies to Medics and Scouts, thanks General_Mayhem / ordinaryrendition / kpxkrappy1)
* **ENGINEER**: An ally walks up to you and your buildings. WHAM, a sapper comes out of nowhere. **THAT ALLY IS A SPY**. Depending on the situation, kill the spy first if you don't want to get killed, or risk another sapper if you are dead, or destroy the sapper first, if you are Companion Cube'd (really attached) to your Sentry.
* **SPY***(oh the irony)*: With your knife out, you get in the backstab stance when behind an ally. **GO CLICK YOUR LEFT MOUSE BUTTON**.
* **SNIPERS/SCOUTS**: Items which deal bleed, Jarate and Mad Milk can affect spies. They also reveal cloaked spies.
* **MEDIC**: You don't get ubercharge when healing. This is a good time to get your saw out and kill him. You also get the achievement ""FYI I Am a Medic"".

Those are the most common ways. There are way more others. If you are intrested, [the official Team Fortress 2 wiki has a guide.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Spycheck)

**so how do u get betta at spychecking??????//**

The easiest way to get better at spychecking, ironically, is to play spy yourself. After getting good at it, you should know what a disguised spy acts like. Use that when playing other classes.

That concludes my guide. If there are any better/more common ways to spycheck, feel free to post a comment. I'll (hopefully) update my guide with credit.

Now, if you're reading this, and are genuinely looking for help on how items work, then you've come to the right place. If you're here to judge my abilities, don't downvote (it's a self, redditor, I'm not getting Karma, so why downvote?) but comment below as to why you think something is wrong etc. and I'll make amendments. :) The discussion will always help people who are unsure about things!
(Also, I'm aware that there is probably going to be a bunch of comments saying ""just go to the wiki"" etc. but some people are lazy etc.)

**What is an item?**
An item is something that is in your backpack. You can access this at any time by pressing N during a game, or from the menu, selecting items. You can also press M to open the loadout for your current class, enabling you to equip the items you already have.

**What can you do with them?**
You can equip them to a class, you can craft them, you can use them, or you can trade them.

**What do items do, and why are there so many different items?**
The items can provide stat bonuses, stat reductions, and extra possible actions depending on the item. For example, the Wrangler allows you to point your sentry gun wherever you want, but will give it a 2 second downtime whenever you switch to another weapon. Most weapons are better than others, some worse, but a majority are side-grades, where the benefits are pretty much equal to the cons.

Equip items:
These are either weapons, taunts, badges, shoes, food, or hats!

Usable items:
These are paints, crates, keys, name/description tags, and duels.

**What is the point in hats?**
You wear them.

**....is that it?**
YES. That's it. They're a sign of the blood sweat and tears/money you put into making/buying that hat. Some people don't like hats, but some people LOVE hats. Also some hats are part of a set, and when the whole set is equipped it produces a set bonus, similar to the bonuses of individual items, but without any stats being lowered.

**What are Strange Weapons, and what makes them so Strange?**
Strange weapons are variations of different weapons. These variations track how many kills you have with that one weapon, and as more kills are accumulated, the name changes, and the name becomes more and more dangerous. The most popular of the Strange Weapons series is the Strange Shotgun, as it can be used by the Soldier, Pyro, Heavy, and Engineer, and is the only Strange Weapon that can be used by more than 2 classes. They do not provide any stat bonuses other than the ones that the regular version of the weapon would provide. (as of 6/30/2011) It seems the only way to get Strange Weapons at the moment is through trading or through a Series 19, 20, or 21 crate. (Thanks, tidwell!)

**How do I get items?**
There are a number of ways to get items:

1. ~~Items are dropped randomly every 15 to 75 minutes of play. Valve says it depends on how much you play a week, but we all know that's bullshit. You can only pick up 10 items a week however. (For premium, at least, F2P I don't know how many you can get in a week)~~

Kryhavok says:
&gt;You will receive drops at a rate of 1 every 30-70 minutes for up to ~10 hours of gameplay. Therefore, any gameplay past the 10 hour mark in a week will not reward you with any more drops. This resets every Thursday (although it seems to happen for me late Wednesday evening, CST).
Apparently, time also carries over, up to two weeks worth of time (20-22 hrs). So if you don't play for a full 10-11 hours one week, the next week you'll have 10-10 + whatever you had left from last week.



2. Buying them from the Mann Co. Store. These items, however, cannot be crafted, and also are not trade-able for the first few days. You can buy things from the store by adding funds to your Steam wallet.

3. Trading. You can find someone that will give you an item for free maybe, or trade for different items. More info will be below.

4. Achievements. Each class has 3 achievement milestones, for reaching a certain number of achievements. Some achievements are impossible without certain items, and back in the old days of 2008, it used to be the ONLY way to get items. The number varies from class to class. These milestones will each unlock one item for that class.
If you want to unlock these items quickly, though, then there are a number of achievement farms out there, maps that are designed to make achievement earning a lot easier. Sure, it's a crappy way to do it, but it's how I did it, back when it started. But if you do it that way, there will always be proof that you did in your scores. For example, my longest time alive was an hour and a half, as an engineer. Furthermore my most kills in one life is something like 1039 or something. See?

**I want items faster/more items, how do I do this?**
Well there are a number of ways:

1. Achievement/Idle Servers. Idle servers basically kill you constantly, over a period of however long you wish to be there. I'm currently in one as I type this up, just log on, and alt tab and browse Reddit. Sure, it's another one of those things that people will say ""YOU'RE SO LAZY WHY DON'T YOU JUST PLAY?"" Well I don't feel like playing, so I'm idling. Also going on Achievement servers will speed up how quickly you get achievements, and therefore how quickly you unlock the achievement-based items.

2. Scam people out of their items. I'm not saying you should, but it happens. There are gonna be more details on how to avoid this below.

3. Spend money in the Mann Co. store. Yeah, buy the item you want, it saves time crafting and idling and having items you don't want.

4. Spend money in the Mann Co. Store, and idle. This is something one of the players on a server I was on did, and it is rather impressive. Basically, for 5 bucks, (minimum Steam Wallet addition) you can increase the items you pick up in a week by 10. Just make a new account, find another computer, install TF2, buy something from the Mann Co. Store to make it a premium account, idle, and trade all the items to your main account. If you spend 20 bucks, you can rake in 50 items a week. How about that?

**How do I not get scammed, and how do I know if I'm being scammed?**
There are some key examples:

1. Never ""lend"" someone an item, even if it is someone you know. Unless you trade it for an item you believe is a completely fair trade, and you are willing to part with it forever in case they do, then don't lend the item. If you do this, they could just disappear from your friends list, and could just play on a different server etc. and you will never see said item again.

2. Make sure that it is the item you want. For example, if you want to trade for a Strange Shotgun, make sure it's a Strange Shotgun, and not just a shotgun that has a name tag and description tag on it (I know you can't trade shotguns, but it still applies to other Strange Weapons) Name and Description Tags both use quotation marks around the name of whatever the user decides to use on the tag, making it easy to recognize.

3. Before thinking about answering someone on a trade server, have a look around, ask people you know and trust what most people would trade for it. For example, some people seem to think that earbuds are worth something like 4 reclaimed metal, whereas some people think they aren't worth anything at all. Of course it's all down to your decision, but think about what you think the item is worth, with some help from other people. Furthermore, don't trust what the other person says they are worth. They could be lying, saying their weapon is worth ten times what it actually is. Because you will easily be able to find someone who would trade you the same item for a better deal. Even if you've traded with them before.

4. Don't think that a Vintage Weapon is something special. Every now and again, Valve makes all weapons from before a certain date vintage, so all it means is that it has been around a while, but it doesn't really change it's worth. This is more of a personal thing for me because I don't see the point, BUT still.

5. Don't trade hats. Ever.

**What happens if I do get scammed? How do I get my item(s) back?**
Unfortunately, if you get scammed, it's not really possible to do anything about it. You probably won't see the item again. Just go and find another one and try as hard as you can not to get scammed.

**What is Crafting?**
Crafting is changing multiple unwanted items into one wanted item.

**How do I craft items?**
In the screen which shows all the classes, the backpack, the trading, the crafting icon, etc. click the crafting icon. Then, choose what you want to craft, and if you have the items for it, you can craft the item. This will permanently destroy the items you used to craft, and give you a brand new item that you want to craft. This is irreversible (except with Scrap, Reclaimed, and Refined metal).

**What are Slot and Class Tokens, and how do I use them?**
These are tokens representing one of the nine classes, and one of the 4 weapon types. (Primary, Secondary, Melee, and PDA (Watches etc. for Spies)) You use one slot, one class, and one scrap metal to craft a weapon for that one slot and that one class. You can also use the class token to make a class specific hat.

**Scrap Metal? What is that?**
It's what you get when you craft two weapons together. Basically.

If you want to find out what you need for a particular item before you go to the crafting menu, you can browse the TF2 wiki for the item you want and see what you need to craft it.

I intend for this to be as helpful as possible, as I find that many new players do not have a place to have their questions answered. Although the TF2 economy is simpler than a real world economy, it does have its complications and nuances, and this guide intends to help the general knowledge about that. I am by no means a good writer, and there is an abundance of information I do not know, therefore I am asking those in the Reddit community who can help contribute to contribute. Hope this helps!

**The Basics**
In its simplest terms, the TF2 currency can be said to be based on weapons.  These are the cheapest and most common items in the game, and everyone has them. Acquiring them is  fairly easy, as playing the game results in dropped weapons; one could think of playing the game as work, and the weapon drops as a salary, albeit one worth very little. Weapons can either be equipped or crafted into scrap metal. Scrap metal represents the next tier up from weapons, as 2 weapons of the same class (for example, 2 random soldier weapons) can be used to create a scrap metal. Keep in mind that this process cannot be reversed, once a scrap is created, there is no way of getting back the 2 items you used to create it. As such, people will use either items they don’t want or items they have extras of to create scrap. So what can you do with scrap? Usually, not very much. Sometimes you can buy crates (explained later) with scrap, but you’ll usually use multiple scrap to create reclaimed metal. Reclaimed metal is created by crafting 3 scrap metals together. Reclaimed metal is slightly more useful than scrap; it is often used as parts of trades involving refined metal, the next level of currency. Refined metal is created by crafting together 3 reclaimed metals. Refined metal can be described as the “dollar bill” of the TF2 economy, as many items are valued in refined metal. Things will often be sold for parts of refined metal, which indicates reclaimed or scrap metal. For example, 1.33 refined is 1 refined metal and 1 reclaimed metal. Therefore we can say the 1 reclaimed is .33 of a refined, which is logical because it takes 3 reclaimed to make a refined. You may see values of 1.44 or 1.55. These indicate that scrap is required. You could say that 1 scrap is worth .11 refined, as it is worth 1/3rd of a reclaimed metal. If you are buying a hat (also, explained later) worth 1.44 refined, you would be trading 1 refined, 1 reclaimed, and 1 scrap. Simple enough, right? I can see you guys right now, rolling your eyes at the screen, thinking “Thanks for the lesson on adding, dumbass,” but again, this is for new players (of all ages), and so I felt it was necessary for this to be here.

Tl; dr:
2 weapons -&gt; 1 scrap metal
3 scrap metal -&gt; 1 reclaimed metal (6 weapons)
3 reclaimed metal -&gt; 1 refined metal (18 weapons)

**It’s worth MONEY?**
Now that you have some refined metal, you can start trading for items of monetary value. For the most part, you will be trading your refined metal for keys. The keys in question, Mann Co. Supply Keys, are available from the Team Fortress 2 store on Steam. They are sold for $2.49, however, only very rarely will you pay this much for each key. You can typically find them for under $2.00. Each key is worth around 2.33-2.66 refined, depending on the trader. What this means is that all those random weapon drops you’re getting can eventually be worth real money. While some of you go celebrate, let’s take a few moments to figure this whole thing out. WARNING: BASIC MATH LESSON AHEAD. (Happy now?)  Assuming that you’re buying a key for 2.66 refined, you’ll need… that’s right 2 refined and 2 reclaimed metal. Doing the math in our heads, that’s 48 dropped weapons. Assuming that you get 8 drops a week, that’s about 6 weeks of playing TF2, or a month and a half. So essentially, you spent a month and a half “working” to earn 2 dollars. I’m sure your parents are proud.
So what are keys for? Typically they are used as a price guide for items, as they have a fairly constant value in the market. As they have a monetary value, you can sell them for actual money, trade them for other items, or open crates.

Tl; dr:
2 weapons -&gt; 1 scrap metal
3 scrap metal -&gt; 1 reclaimed metal (6 weapons)
3 reclaimed metal -&gt; 1 refined metal (18 weapons)
~2.66 refined -&gt; 1 key (48 weapons)
1 key -&gt; ~$2.00

**Dem crates**
Alongside weapons, crates will be randomly dropped as well. However, they do not contribute to the weapon drop limit each week. Crates can only be opened by keys, and will return either an item of “Strange” quality, hats, paints, or unusual hats. Some older crates may also drop regular weapons. Strange quality weapons are worth more than their regular counterparts, and hats each have a value in refined, while unusual hats have values in keys. Some crates can be worth a lot, and some can be worth nothing at all. Remember that opening a crate is essentially investing money into an item, so it’s up to you to decide if its worth it. Remember that the item received from each crate is determined when you open the crate, so if someone is trying to sell you a crate that he guarantees will drop X item, get outta there.

Tl; dr:
Crates can only be opened with keys
Crates drop weapons, hats and unusual hats
Some crates can be worth more than other crates

**Promotional items**
Promo items, such as Earbuds, Bills Hat’s, or Max’s Head’s are worth multiple keys. This is due to the fact that there are only a limited amount of these in the game. Promotional items are typically given out for preordering certain games, or for other limited time events. For example, Bill’s Hat’s were given to the people who preordered Left 4 Dead 2. Because of the limited nature of these items, they are worth quite a bit. They are commonly used as currency for high cost trades. The most common promo items are: Bill’s Hat’s, Earbuds, and Max’s Head’s. At the time of this writing, unpainted Bill’s Hat’s are worth around 7-9 keys, Earbuds are worth around 19-22 keys, and Max’s Head’s are worth around X keys. It can be fair to say that 1 Earbud is worth around 2 Bill’s Hat’s and the around 1 Max’s Head is worth about 2.5 Earbuds, or 4-5 Bill’s Hats. If you happen to acquire these items, you will probably do one of 3 things, keep them to brag about, trade them for different items, or sell them for money. At the time of writing the price of these, in keys, happens to be decreasing, so keep that in mind if you plan on selling/trading promo items in the future.

Tl; dr:
7-9 keys -&gt; Bill’s Hat
2.5 Bill’s Hats -&gt; 1 Earbud( ~21 keys)
2 Earbuds -&gt; Max’s Head (4-5 Bill’s Hats or ~40 keys)
The price (in keys) of these items is currently decreasing.

**Hats, HATS, HAAATTTTSSSS!**
Hats. The only purpose for trading in the TF2 economy. If you have a hat you are a good player. If you don’t, you’re probably a F2P noob. Loljk, but hats DO have quite a bit of value. Basic hats can be acquired in one of 3 ways, uncrating, crafting, or trading.

1326452071.0,40,self.NewToTF2,ofbhh,4 Golden Rules of Medics and their patients (And 4 Myths),chopsoy0,40,0,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ofbhh/4_golden_rules_of_medics_and_their_patients_and_4/,"This is aimed at new to intermediate players (&lt;6 months). This is for people who know what's going on in the game but don't know how to optimize their performance, i.e. you know when and how to uber but you don't know that you should absorb the knockback from sentries when ubered.

## Golden Rules


**DO. NOT. DIE.**

*  Medics are the most important people on the team, only second to engineers who are under heavy fire while repairing their sentries. Your average life time should be slightly below that of the engineer. Make sure you get that number above 40 seconds (min time to 100%). 

*  Your position as medic is much more important than any other class. I would happily sacrifice two scouts, two soldiers, a demoman, and a heavy to save a medic. Assume that everyone on your team is an idiot unless otherwise noted, do not follow scouts and spies as they flank. Do not follow suicide jumper soldiers. Do not follow anyone who is willing to take the two of you into a nest of enemies. Stay with your TEAM, not one person.

**Heal heal heal, and heal EVERYONE!**

*  This should be a no brainer, but you won't believe the number of newbies these days playing battle medic or only pocketing one person on the team. I can recall many occasions where I (a pyro) would stand facing a medic who is healing his heavy buddy, yelling medic, and spamming flames in his face, waiting for him to switch his medic beam from his overhealed buddy to my 15hp lifebar, with no results as enemy soldier jumps us both with rockets.

*  Heal EVERYONE. That means you want your beam fixed on the person with the lowest health. Your role here is to make sure everyone on your team has extremely low health but nobody ever dies. A heavy with 15hp is still a heavy with $12,000 per minute boolets. A scout with 1 hp is still a mouthful of lead. Spread your healing as much as you can. Never continuously heal one person when you can heal someone else. You build the uber faster if you're healing injured people. (See this for details: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2afZ9xiSSZs).

*  This should be your heal priority:
   1.  People with red health on fire
   2.  Other medics
   3.  People with red health
   4.  People on fire
   5.  People slightly hurt
   6.  Overhealed people

*  Notice I've put ""other medics"" on top, above everyone except burning scouts in the red. That means you only heal them to put out flames. Because unless that medic is at 225 health, your job is not done. Imagine if you're the 90% charged, burning medic with red health and the other medic wouldn't heal you. When you heal a medic, you're not just healing a person. You're healing a pool. Every 1 point you heal on a medic is 5 points healed on another teammate. That medic can then be more aggressive and take more damage. Heal them ESPECIALLY when their ubercharges are high. Make sure you have constant healing if they've popped kritz.

**Watch for flanks, spies, and faraway snipers**

*  Make it a habit to swing 180 and back every 5 seconds. Spies can strike at any point (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2tV91UJjXQ). Your patient will be distracted by things in front 10 feet of you two, so call out over mic for spies behind you, scouts/pyros that are flanking, demo/soldiers that have jumped you, hidden sentries when you're ubered, and especially snipers far away waiting for your uber to wear off. Tell your teammate to back off before the uber finishes, if necessary.

*  After some experience you'll identify the unique screams that people make when they die by a melee weapon. This is a usually because of a spy's backstab. Take some time to either memorize or rebind the voice commands for ""Sentry ahead"", ""Uber ready"", ""Spy"", ""Help"", and ""Incoming"". If your patient doesn't respond to your tips, leave him to die, he's not worth getting the both of you killed.

**Follow uber, no matter what class you are**

*  This applies for everyone, not just medics. When your team medic and his patient have popped uber, follow them. They'll be airblasted by pyros, knocked back by sentires, pushed by demomen, and later killed by the C&amp;D spy in the back. They'll need all of your help as they clear out the sentry nest, the teleporter exit, and bags of meat in between. The best thing is, they'll soak up all the damage. 

*  All of enemies will be distracted, allowing you to get by and do side damage that nobody will notice. Scouts, pyros, spies can flank the sides and back and pick off engineers and medics. Soldiers can get rid of any stickies and pyros. Other medics, heavies, demos can follow suit and add firepower. Engies can set up minisentries or move some gear up. Snipers can reposition and headshot some people who are too distracted to dodge.

## Common Myths

**You popped uber too early, you've wasted it.**

*  There's no such thing as a wasted uber. Even if you use it on a spy/sniper, it's still 8 seconds of invulnerability on a teammate and yourself. They can defend points/carts, move up, or be saved from death. That said, there are more efficient ways to use ubers. If you popped just a bit early and don't get any kills, it's still enough to push the enemy line back through intimidation, and allow your teammates to move up and get a better position. Always pop your uber if death is imminent (pop it don't drop it). At least it saves you a trip back to your spawn and 20 seconds of not charging your next uber.

*  When you get an uber, you should be so desperate to pop it, so you can start charing your next one. In some games I've seen medics who hold on to 1 uber for so long that they could've used the time to charge 2 ubers.

**Medics should use the needle gun/blautsauger/ubersaw/bonesaw given the circumstances (self-defence).**

*  If you're new to the game (&lt;6 months) I recommend you don't fight back under any circumstances at all. The reason is because unless you've played FPSs your entire life, you need to focus on your movement and getting away rather than peddling backwards and aiming. I cannot tell you the number of times I've died to pyros/scouts because I've gotten stuck on some corner next to a door on an unfamiliar map. Make sure you sway side to side to avoid boolets, and run forwards to avoid flames. You run slower backwards: backwards speed is 90% of regular speed. You can outrun every class except for the scout. Medics have at least 107% running speed of any other class.

**Medics should be in the front lines, healing the recently injured.**

*  Medics heal fresh wounds a LOT slower than old wounds. Valve added this mechanic to encourage falling back. You can do a lot more good for your  team healing more DPS. In the front lines, you're more likely to get killed and lose the uber. In the front lines, your patient is more likely to die and leave you vulnerable. In the front lines, you're visible to the other team, and everyone will be aiming for you. You should be in a position where you can barely see the enemy team, while your patient can see two or three of them. You should be about halfway between the front lines and the nearest dispenser.

*  That said, I like to fight on the front lines. As your dodging skills improve, you  will be more and more comfortable near the front.

**Medics are a support class**

*  False. Medics are a carry class. Entire team without a medic is baby team and easily crushed. Medics should always be in the top of the scoreboard. Remember you get most of your points from healing (1pt per 600hp) and ubers (1pt). Even if you don't get assists, you're still helping the team. You need to healing the right people at the right time (offensive classes for pushing, defensive for falling back). You need to be everywhere at once (healing) and nowhere at all (doding). You need to always be on the move. Your job should have some rhythm. Gauge where your enemy is, make a boundary for how far you will or won't go, know where you can fall back, and stay with your team.

*  Assume that everyone on your team is an idiot and not worth dying for, unless otherwise noted by performance. Your life is much more important than theirs.

## Lastly: Bonus! - A chart of heal priorities by class:

1.  Other medics
2.  Soldiers / Demo
3.  Heavies
4.  Scouts / Pyros / Spies
5.  Engies / Snipers (They can go find a dispenser)

**51 Signs of a Spy**

*Obvious Spy Guide Makes Spies Obvious*

 

Be on the lookout for these behaviors.  They’re often a sign that you have a spy on your hands.

##Non-class specific

* Looking at you, sentries, or other team mates and NOT the other team.
* They are lined up, or lining up driectly behind someone. Very noticible if the other person is faster than they are, and then they suddenly break away.
* Someone is not firing in areas with easy ammo access(Esp. near dispensers)
* Someone is on the cart, and the cart isn’t moving
* More than one person is on a point, and it displays as a lesser number of people attempting to capture it.
* Someone is sitting in a corner for no particular reason.
* Someone at full health waiting for health to respawn.
* Health/Ammo/Weapons suddenly vanishing without anyone nearing it(Not really behavior, but something people seem to not pay attention to)
* The person is carrying non-primary weapons.
* The person is wearing a particularly rare hat(Easier if you know where the other person is)
* There are two people with the same name
* Anyone calling out medic with more health than their “MEDIC!” icon indicates. IE: Dark red icon when they’re mid to full health.
* Anyone of a class not specifically held by other members.
* They don’t seem to die when hit with massive amounts of enemy fire.
* They don’t react to enemy attacks, or pushes, or act defensively when approached by enemies
* They are ignored by enemy players when they are particularly easy kills. IE: Medics/engineers/snipers right next to demos/pyros
* They are burning and glowing a different color, or are dripping with milk/jarate.
* They are evasive to your team or your team’s attacks. Especially evasive of pyros.

-------------------------------

##Class specific

**Snipers:**

* Not scoped in, doesn’t scope in.
* Near, or approaching the front line, using a weapon other than their sniper rifle.
* Moving forward/backwards a lot. Snipers mainly strafe.

**Engineers:**

* Not near their gear, or near someone else’s gear without hitting it with a wrench.
* Coming from the front line, and not a gunslinger engineer(Robot hand).
* Doesn’t remove sappers from buildings, or isn’t trying to.
* Isn’t using a wrench near gear, and isn’t firing his weapon randomly near his dispenser.

**Scouts:**

* Moving slowly, or not double jumping. Obvious spy.

**Pyro:**

* Not puffing flame.
* Is on fire. Pyros don’t burn. (Useful for spotting enemy spies disguised as pyros on their own team)
* Using the shotgun or axe at long range.
* Using the flaregun and (sometimes) axe in short range.
* Running away from the front line with full health.

**Heavy:**

* Remaining at long range for extended periods of time. (Though this could just be them being inexperienced)
* Staying behind players for long periods of time.
* Not taking damage from enemy fire(Worth noting, as they’re much larger targets.)
* Using ‘fists’ whenever not using the Gloves of Running Urgently.
* Running slow still when using the GLoves of Running Urgently, also not taking damage while using the Gloves of Running Urgently.
* Runs away from fights with full health

**Soldier:**

* Not firing their rockets for long periods of time, even at long range.
* Capable of being healed even when the equalizer is out.
* Does not move fasters with equalizer out while injured.
* Runs away from fights with full health

**Demoman:**

* Using melee weapon at long range.
* Not spamming grenades/stickies.
* No stickies in general area while a demoman is present. (Odd, but not always a spy)
* Runs away from fights with full health

**Medic:**

* Not healing.
* Running slightly slower than usual. A bit harder to notice than the scout. The healing bit is a bigger indicator.

**Spy:**

* Not revealing himself to you by attacking.
* Not disguised as a friendly while near your team(Though he just may be a less experienced spy)
* Not moving as slowly as his disguised class should be.
* Hangs around other friendlies while disguised too long (Spys give themselves away by being too close to their actual allies.)",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_rjmaw,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/rjmaw/51_signs_of_a_spy_obvious_spy_guide_makes_spies/,

The medic will mainly heal the Pocket (because the Pocket is nearby), but he will obviously heal everyone else as well (according to the usual heal orders).

If you are playing in the role of Pocket, you will be a credit to the team by making sure the medic lives, and only allowing the medic to die if you are already back in the spawn waiting for them.

I decided to change things up a bit with this guide.  There are things we know we don't know, and there are things we don't know that we don't know.  This is a guide on the latter of those two things.  These are built-in game mechanics that most people don't know to ask about, or will likely never learn unless under very specific circumstances.

-----

**Control Points and Payload Carts**

Control Points each have their own amount of time required to capture.  In **Attack/Defend** maps(Like Dustbowl, or Gravel Pit), the first points captures more slowly than the last point.

In **Control Point** games, the first and last captures are the fastest, while the second and fourth caps are the second fastest, and the third(also known as the 'mid point') capture the slowest.

Control points can be captured by numerous individuals at a time to increase how quickly the point is captured. 

* **1st Person**: 100% capture rate 
* **2nd Person**: 150% capture rate **(+50%)**
* **3rd Person**: 183% capture rate **(+33%)**
* **4th Person**: 208% capture rate **(+25%)**

And it continues to decrease with each additional person.  Generally, it is a good idea to explore other activities after the point exceeds 4 people, as clustering together on control points makes you all very vulnerable targets to explosive classes, such as the Soldier and Demoman, and there are other opportunities to gain an advantage on your enemy's team, such as clearing the way to the following points before they can recover from that capture.

**Payload carts** and **Payload Race carts** behave a bit differently.  As you're capturing them, **they act as level 1 dispensers**(They will heal and provide you with ammo.)  

**Their capture rates are limited to 3 people**, but any number of members of your team may benefit from the healing and ammo provided by these carts.

If after 30 seconds your team(Generally blue) doesn't touch the cart, it will start to move backwards, reversing any progress made to capturing the next point.

In Payload Race maps, the carts never move backwards, unless they are on designated slopes when they stop moving.

**Did you know?:** The final control point in the Well Map can be captured in 2 seconds by a single person?  *Get. On. The. Point, Maggots!*

-----

**Respawning**

**Players respawn in waves.**  The default wave time is 10 seconds, and the minimum respawn time is 5 seconds(Which is normally consumed by the deathcam, displaying who killed you.  No, disabling or skipping deathcams does not make you spawn faster.)  Many players will have to wait more than one respawn wave, making the maximum wait time to respawn 20 seconds on servers without mods.  All respawn times are altered slightly, based on the population on the server. (Lower population usually means faster respawns.)

Some map types offer altered spawn times depending on a variety of factors, such as how many points your team controls and what color your team is(whether you're attacking or defending)  

In most **Attack and Defend** game types, **Blue will spawn faster than Red** and will **spawn faster for each point they control, or if they capture all points but the last**.  This makes it important for Red to **build as strong of a defense as early as possible**, as it will only become harder to defeat Blue once they start making captures.

In game types where both teams have the option to attack or defend, the team with the most control points often spawns more quickly than the team with less control points, encouraging and rewarding aggressive play styles rather than defensive ones.

-----

**Damage Modifiers**

Damage changes for a number of reasons.  First off, all weapons have a standard amount of damage they do.  This is called their base damage, and is used only when the weapon hits someone from its medium range(Except melee weapons, which can only be used up close)

**Damage increases when...**

* You are closer to the enemy(150% damage, aka damage ramp up)
* When you attack enemies vulnerable to your damage type due to their choice in load out(Fire, bullets, explosives, melee, etc.)
* When you land a critical hit(300% damage).
* When you land a mini-crit (133% damage)

**Damage decreases when...** 

* Your target is protected by the Battalion's Backup buff.
* Your target is more resilient to your types of damage due to their load out.
* You are far away from the enemy(50% damage, AKA Damage fall off)
* You hit the enemy indirectly(Splash damage) or partially(not all pellets hit)

-----

**Crit and Mini-crit Mechanics**

Critical hits and mini-critical hits **both ignore damage fall off**, meaning that any hit dealt from any range will always deal their crit damage(minus all other modifiers.) This is important to remember, since **crit or mini-crit boosting will enable more effective fighting at a distance for most classes**.

Mini-crits can still benefit from damage ramp up, up to 150% damage, though crits do not benefit from ramp up, since their damage is a full 300%.

Mini-crits and crits do not work together, and crits will over ride mini-crits when both are applicable to a target.

Mini-crits boosts can only be applied by altered loadouts(Such as Jarate, Fan of War, Buff Banner, etc.)  The only exception to this is the Pyro's air blast, which has a chance of turning regular rockets and grenades into mini-crits rockets and grenades.

Critical hits can be granted by a number of boosts, such as arena mode's **First Blood**, the medic's **Kritztrieg** overcharge, and Humiliation mode.   Critical hits **can also be predicted** by a variety of weapons and techniques, such as the Pyro's Axtinguisher crits, the Engineer's Frontier Justice crits.

Critical hits can also be randomly awarded to weapons that can receive them.  Standard weapons(Primary and secondary) **have a base 2% chance to crit when fired**.  

**High rate of fire weapons** such as the Mini-gun, the syringe gun, pistols and the flame thrower **check once every second as they're being fired** to determine if they will receive crits.   When these weapons receive crits randomly, they last for 2 seconds while they continue to fire.

Melee weapons receive a base chance of 15% to critically hit, unless they have predictable crits.

**Your critical hit chance is modified by how much damage you do within 20 seconds.**  The more damage you deliver, the higher the chance to crit, starting at 0% bonus at 0 damage, to 10% additional chance to crit(12% for standard weapons, 25% for melee weapons) at 800 damage.  These numbers are reset if you die.

-----

**Charge Rates**

Medics charge their uber at varying rates.  Healing damaged players, and overhealing players at 100% health will charge the medic's ubercharge by **2.5% every second.**

Players at 150% health(Max overheal) will only charge the medic's uber by 1.25% per second .  Players receiving healing from multiple sources(Such as a second medic, or a dispenser) will also only charge at 1.25% per second.

Both the Kritzrieg and the Quick Fix build their charges 25% faster than the stock Medigun.

During setup, the medic charges at 2.5% rate, even if his target is at 150% health.  This rate can only decrease if the target receives healing from more than one source.

At the rate of 2.5% per second, a medic can fully charge his stock medigun in 40 seconds.  The Kritz and Quick-Fix charge in 30 seconds.

Medics also charge by using the Ubersaw.  While it is common knowledge that the Ubersaw builds a charge on hit, **a successful taunt-kill with the Ubersaw will completely fill the medic's charge meter.**

GOOD.  I show you how, and we can kill many tiny baby men together.

**Heavy Overview:**

* Has an enormous health pool (300 health)
* Has the largest hit box of any other class.
* Slower than other classes.
* Even slower while firing his mini-gun
* Devastating to enemies caught in bullet spray.
* Must 'wind up* his mini gun before firing.
* Stock Weapons include: Mini-gun, Shotgun, Fists.
* Different load out options grant him the ability to heal himself or other players, run more swiftly, wind up quickly and silently, slow enemy players caught in the bullet spray, and more.

The Heavy's Roles on a Team:

* Defending points.
* Providing continuous cover fire. 
* Holding down front lines with other front line classes(Demos, Pyros, Soldiers)
* Guarding choke points.
* Ambushing enemy players.
* Protecting other team members by soaking damage, grabbing attention or just plain killing enemy players.
* Capturing enemy points using brute force.

They are vulnerable to...

* Terrain disadvantages (Low or distant terrain)
* Peeking explosive users (Soldiers or demos using cover)
* Snipers (They have big heads)
* Spies (They're slow and easy to catch)

Now that you have a general idea of what the heavy is, lets dig right into techniques that improve how you perform in their roles.


**Overheal Maintaining**

In defensive capacities, if you receive an overheal from a medic and camp a dispenser, you will retain the overheal until the dispenser is destroyed/out of range, or until you take the damage required to remove it.  

**Squatting**

Against other heavies, it is advantageous to crouch while you fire your weapon.  You will be unable to move while doing this, but it reduces the effective area you can be hit.  Because of the large spread on miniguns, you stand to be hit less often when they are used against you.

**Jump-Winding**

You move slower as your gun is winding or firing.  You can circumvent this slightly by jumping as you begin to wind your gun.  This is fantastic for rounding corners that may have enemies on the other side of them.  With your gun pre-wound as you leap into the open, it can catch even other heavies off guard and give you a sizable advantage in the following firefight.  Do this around every corner, and you have yourself a fantastic ambushing technique.

**Tunnel camping**

If you have resources available to you, you can camp tunnels by hiding around the corner at one of their ends.  When enemy players try to pass, use the jump-winding technique to flood the tunnel with bullets.  If the tunnel is long enough, and doesn't have many sources of cover, you can void it in seconds.

**Sandvich Drop**

The alternative fire mechanism on the sandvich drops the sandvich on a plate, which immediately beings to act like a medpack.  When you need it, or your ally needs it, drop the sandvich for a very quick restoration of health.

**Heavy Bomb**

Using the Gloves of Running Urgently, you can speed into the enemy team before they have an opportunity to build(or rebuild) defenses.  The gloves allow you to run 30% faster(Which places you at 99% normal speed), and you can use them in order to close distance gaps and gain your advantage at close to mid-ranged combat.  Unfortunately, this technique is mildly suicidal, but can pay off big if executed against dwindling enemy numbers.

**The Heavy-Medic Bomb**

Using the gloves of running again, and with a medic prepared with an uber, charge into the enemy team.  Coordinate with your doctor so that when your health gets low, or his life becomes endangered, to use the uber.  This is effective even against well defended points when properly done.  Once you are ubered and in your prime range, fill the area with bullets and watch your enemies scatter.  Be careful against teams that have pyros within the area, as their airblasts can send you flying out of your best range.  Consider using flanking paths in order to get the better drop on your enemy.

**Heavy is turtle!**

Using the Fists of Steel melee weapon, heavies can capture points/carts that do not have defenders in mid or close range.  The gloves will soak a sizable portion of your incoming damage.  This, combined with crouching, limits your effective area to be hit as well as reducing damage once you are hit.  This can also be used to act as a human shield for enemies who are trying to dispatch sentries while under the effects of ubercharges or too distant to reliably shoot down.

**Heavy is Train Engine!**

Heavies firing and crouched cannot move.  However, if capturing a cart, heavies can crouch in front of the cart and be pushed by it, allowing them to reduce their effective hit area, have infinite ammo and continuous healing, all while moving.  This, however, can result in becoming an easier target for enemy snipers.


**Recommended Key Binds:**

* Quick Sandvich Drop:

This will bind a command that will swap to your sandvich and drop it.  This particular example assumes you have a navigation mouse(With a built in ""Back"" and ""Forward"" buttons), but you can change that setting(Mouse4) to any other button you can easily reach.

&gt;Alias ""+sandvich"" ""slot2; +attack2""

&gt;Alias ""-sandvich"" ""-attack2""

&gt;Bind ""MOUSE4"" ""sandvich""

* Activate Ubercharge!

If you lack a mic, use this to communicate with your medic when you need him to deploy his ubercharge.

&gt;Bind ""MOUSE5"" ""voicemenu 1 6""

* Thanks! Good job!

Be sure to always thank your medics, and tell them they did a good job(if they did a good job.)

Thanks!:

&gt;Bind ""F1"" ""voicemenu 0 1""

Good Job!

&gt;Bind ""F2"" ""Voicemenu 2 7""


**Recommended Load Outs and Items**

***Loadout #1:***

* Primary: Mini-Gun or Tomislav. 
* Secondary: Sandvich
* Melee: Gloves of Running Urgently.

**Pros: **
Speed and survivability.  This load out works well both in defensive and offensive capacities and works well with every tactic listed here.

**Cons:**
Relies exclusively on the Mini-gun/Tomislav to fight.  Once you're out of ammo, the gloves can only do 50% of the regular melee damage, and the Sandvich isn't much of a fighter.  Overcome these challenges by knowing where to get ammo, and collecting ammo from people you kill.

***Loadout #2***

* Primary: Tomislav
* Secondary: Stock Shotgun or Family Business
* Melee: Killing Gloves of Boxing

**Pros: **
The Tomislav and shotgun combined with the killing gloves of boxing can provide enormous situational damage.  If a careless player is caught offguard and killed with melee hits, the rapid uptime of the Tomislav or the raw mid-ranged stopping power of the shotgun can be devastating to anyone else still alive.  The Tomislav can perform all of the tactics listed here and excels at ambushing.

**Cons:**
The Tomislav and Killing Gloves of Boxing both have 20% slower firing rates.  While the Tomislav's penalty is offset by its rapid windup and silent spin, the Killing Gloves of Boxing are not redeemed until after you've made a successful kill with them.  Overcome these challenges by getting the drop on careless players, then bring chaos to the rest of their team.

***Loadout #3***

* Primary: Brass Beast
* Secondary: Sandvich, Shotgun or Family Business.
* Melee: Fists of Steel

**Pros: **
This loadout makes you a metallic defense minded heavy.  Combine with easy access to a dispenser or other source of health and ammo, and you're in business.  The increased damage output allows you to tear through other classes, and since you'll be mostly stationary anyway, the wind-up penalty is not quite as severe.  The Fists of Steel allow you to soak damage while you escape if things go wrong, or can help soak damage from a sentry getting hit by an ubered player, or players too distant to deal with immediately.

**Cons:**
Unfortunately, the Brass Beast leaves little room for rushing off.  Due to this, roles outside of defense oriented ones are harder to fill with this weapon.  The Fists of Steel's downside can result in very easy melee kills on you.  To overcome these challenges, use the Fists of Steel cautiously against ranged opponents only, stand on the point, and defend friendly engineers who are providing you the health and ammo.  Swapping to the shotgun over the sandvich grants some mobility while still maintaining the ability to return fire.

1351379788.0,38,self.NewToTF2,12707y,PSA: What in the Merasmus is with Halloween this year?,Lapper,42,4,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/12707y/psa_what_in_the_merasmus_is_with_halloween_this/,"For those who are NewToTF2, Halloween is a very special holiday for all of us. Every year is a little bit different, and a lot more confusing. Let's see if we can't break it down for you.

**Abstract**

Join us in the brand new spooky KOTH Ghost Fort and creepy MVM Wave 666 maps to participate in the 4th Annual Scream Fortress Spectral Halloween Special! Fight zombies, spin the wheel of doom, and destroy the evil Merasmus to claim your very own hat!

**Basics**

The Halloween event occurs annually and centers around collecting limited-edition items and fighting a boss. Most items earned during the Halloween event come with a Halloween restriction, meaning they can only be used during Halloween and during a full moon. Individual servers, however, can be modified to allow you to wear your costume all year round. Let's take a look at what previous years brought us.

* 2009: *cp_harvest_event: ""Harvest Event""* &amp;mdash; No boss
* 2010: *cp_manor_event: ""Mann Manor""* &amp;mdash; The Horseless Headless Horsemann
* 2011: *koth_viaduct_event: ""Eyeaduct""* &amp;mdash; Monoculus

Players from both teams must band together or die horribly to the hands of the ridiculously powerful boss, who is often able to kill with a single hit. The reward for the boss' destruction, however, is a Halloween item of your very own.

These old maps are reactivated every Halloween. What does that entail?

* Fun cosmetic Halloween-themed health and ammo pickups
* Pumpkin Bombs, which can be set off to destroy your enemies or launch you high in the air
* Critical pumpkins, which occasionally drop on kill, giving its imbiber 3 seconds of 100% critical chance
* Haunted Halloween Gifts, which contain very special items for someone lucky enough to discover one hidden in the map.

**Ghost Fort**

*koth_lakeside_event*

This is a modified version of Lakeside which houses the new boss, Merasmus. Capping the point will cause Merasmus to select a giant card, a la RTD, to imbue an effect on everyone in the server for a short time. The following list of effects is courtesy of TF2Wiki:

&gt; * ÜberCharges makes every player invulnerable. Because of this, the point cannot be captured for a short time. 
&gt; * Critboosts grants 100% critical chance on each player. 
&gt; * Low Gravity lowers the map gravity, making higher areas accessible. 
&gt; * High Jumps makes every player jump much higher. This does not affect fall damage. 
&gt; * Bigger Heads will cause every players' heads to grow larger. This makes them easy targets for Snipers. Their vocals will be low pitched as well. 
&gt; * Smaller Heads will shrink every players' heads. This increases their vocal pitching and will make them harder to headshot. 
&gt; * Skulls are negative effects and will either ignite every player, bestow bleeding effects on every player, rains Jarate on players, or spawn ghosts that encircle the area around the control point. 
&gt; * Super Speed makes every player run faster.
&gt; * Dance teleports every player to the control point and aligns them into two vertical rows, while they all stop and do the Thriller taunt with Merasmus.

This all makes for a very hectic environment, but on top of everything, the only large health pack is suspended over a bottomless pit of teeth, from which death is the only escape.

But let's talk about Merasmus. Once again, TF2Wiki has your back:

&gt; Merasmus will spawn on Ghost Fort's control point every few minutes when there are at least 10 players playing on the server. The players have 1 minute and 30 seconds to defeat him before he leaves. While he is alive, the point resets to neutral ownership and is unable to be captured. Merasmus's health is displayed as a bar in middle of the screen.

&gt;When Merasmus spawns, he pushes all nearby opponents away and destroys all stickybombs around him, also knocking back all stickybombs he comes in contact with. Merasmus has a wide variety of attacks, and can teleport throughout the map on random intervals. Merasmus can melee players with his staff, roll bombs at them, and perform a magic attack which sets selected targets on fire and launches them skyward. Merasmus can also use an attack far less often than his other attacks, in which he hovers over the control point and uses the Bombinomicon to spread bombs a wide range around the control point. Whenever Merasmus is hovering in the air while performing this attack, all damage dealt to him will be critical hits.

&gt;Every time Merasmus teleports to another location on the map, the Bombinomicon will choose a few players and transform their heads into bombs. Players cannot attack after being turned into bombs and are stuck in their humiliation pose until the bomb detonates, but their speed is also boosted. The screen and the Bombinomicon will instruct the player to find Merasmus and run into him. If the player reaches Merasmus with the bomb, it will stun him, stopping him in his tracks, and the player who transported the bomb will become invulnerable, speed boosted, and crit boosted for a short time. If the player fails to reach Merasmus in time, the bomb will detonate, damaging the player and surrounding members of the opposing team by 100 HP. If the player kills anyone, those show up on the killfeed and grant the player a point. At all times while stunned, all damage Merasmus takes will be critical hits.

&gt;At certain points in the battle, Merasmus will teleport away and disguise himself as a random prop, while other props are scattered about the map to throw players off. These props will bleed green liquid when attacked, distinguishing them from background elements. If an incorrect prop is destroyed, it will drop a large Halloween pumpkin, which any player can collect. If the correct prop is destroyed, Merasmus will reappear and may be stunned for a short period of time, with the player who destroyed the prop always given limited invulnerability, speed boost and crit boost.

&gt;Upon Merasmus' defeat, he will disappear and be replaced by the Bombinomicon. Players can use it to teleport to Skull Island, then climb the hill and collect the Skull Island Topper in the cage. Entering the cage will transport players back to the main field. Defeating Merasmus will award the Necromannchievement Wizards Never Prosper, while collecting the Skull Island Topper will award A Lovely Vacation Spot.

Wow, that's a lot to take in. What's important here is that when the boss spawns, kill him dead and be transported to a magical island of skulls, reach the finish line, and earn your hat. Good luck!

**Wave 666**

* Has 125 health and is considered a light class.
* Can disguise as enemy and friendly players.
* Moves at 100% speed, except when disguised as slower classes.(Soldier, Demoman, Heavy)
* Can become mostly invisible using various spy watches.
* Relies heavily on game mechanics, map knowledge and skill to be successful.
* Can see enemy health meters.
* Stock weapons include the Revolver, the Knife, and the Invis Watch.

**Their role in a team is...**

* **Sabotaging** the enemy's second line and support.
* **Assassinating** high priority targets.
* **Distracting** enemy players.
* Capturing objectives behind enemy players(Back capping/spy capping)

**Excels at...**

* Disabling and removing threats to his team.
* Assessing enemy team composition and vulnerabilities.
* Distracting and panicking enemy players.


**Vulnerable to...**

* Pyros.  Spies continue to burn, even while disguised or cloaked.  
* Jarate.  They *hate* that stuff.
* Mad Milk. They *hate* that stuff too.
* Crossfire.  Friendly crossfire will expose him as a spy.  Enemy crossfire will kill him.
* His own team.  Friendly players not reacting to you in a hostile way exposes you as a spy.
* Spies on his own team.(I explain below)
* All other enemy players, once they're aware of the spy.

**A few words on the Spy..**

The spy is generally not recommended for new players.  The spy relies heavily on map knowledge, game mechanics and skill in order to be effective.  There are many things playing against the spy at any given time, *including his own team*, so it is important to know as much as you can about the game, map, your team, and the enemy team as possible.

On to the guide.

-----

**Spy Paranoia**

Spies often work best alone.  That is, without other spies.  The more spies there are on your team, the more likely it is for all of you to be exposed.  This is due to what is commonly called *Spy Paranoia.*

*Spy Paranoia* is a condition that multiple, or over-active spies can inflict on a team.  It causes people to look for vulnerable points, check behind them, and fire indiscriminately at their own team to root out spies.  The more widespread this is, the harder it is for a spy to perform functions outside of merely distracting the enemy team.  

Limiting spy paranoia is important to being an effective spy.  The less the enemy expects a spy, the more damage the spy can cause before they are noticed.  The best time to expose yourself to the enemy team is when it is far too late for them to do anything about the damage you caused.

-----

**The Other Side of the Second Line**

If you read my engineer guide, you might understand why it is important to have a second line.  Here is the flipside to that, why it is important to disable and remove the second line from behind your enemy team.

* No Escape.

No second line means that there is no where for the enemy to retreat to, except to limited health pack/ammo spawn locations, and their spawn. Because these objects always respawn in the same place, it is easy to predict where the enemy will try to escape to.

* No Return.

If a player dies while there is no second line, they will have to walk back.  This often means there are underpopulated, unprotected points ripe for the capture.

* No Support

Without a sentry and second-line defenders (like the sniper), there will be limited support assisting the front line, meaning heavier, harder hitting classes can move in closer with less challenge.

-----

**The Approach**

In order to do anything as a spy, you need to be away from your team, and within your enemy team's area.  How you perform the approach is heavily dependent on which watch you have equipped, so **I will cover approach techniques much later in the guide, when I cover weapons and load outs.**  Here are the basics, though.

* **Avoid High Traffic Areas.**

The more bodies that are in one place, the more likely you are to get spotted as a spy.  Either you will bump into an enemy, or you will either take splash damage from explosive weapons, catch fire from ambushing pyros, or simply ignored by your friendly team, which will tip enemies off that you're a spy, if you're disguised as them. Solid map knowledge gives more options to the spy.

* **Avoid Crossfire** 

Crossfire can reveal your location if you are cloaked, can give away your disguise if a friendly player accidentally 'hits' you with whatever it is they're shooting, or can kill you, if its the enemy team.

* **Know where the ammo and health is**

After you make it beyond the front line, you're going to need ammo to replenish your watch(if applicable).  Knowing where to get the ammo to do this helps you prepare for further cloak uses.  You'll need the health if you caught any crossfire along the way.  This is largely about map knowledge.

* **It is preferable to not be seen, than to be seen as something else**

Cloaking is generally the best way to get behind the enemy's lines.  If you have the ability to, rush behind enemy lines cloaked the majority of the way.  Pick up fallen weapons and ammo kits to replenish and keep you going until you have a safe place to decloak then disguise.

##Classes and Roles##

**Scout**

*Giant debuffin', Money grabbin', high attitude bot-killin' non-machine.*

The scout's main roles on his team(in addition to killing) are collecting cash and debuffing enemies.  Grabbing cash provides an overheal for the scout, making him significantly more durable than he normally would be.  

Going scout to collect money and ensuring bonuses will help your entire team.  If you abstain from spending money, you can swap classes once the situation presses for it.

Despite having smaller capacities than the stock scattergun, the Soda Popper and the Force a' Nature are very powerful with the right upgrades.  Try expanding their clip sizes and picking up penetration.  With a fast enough firing speed, reload, and capacity, you can deal devastating damage to large groups of enemies.  The Force a' Nature features a knock back, which is good for tossing light enemies around, displacing bomb carriers, resetting the bomb, and delaying fast-moving enemies like sentry busters and Giant Scouts.  The Soda Popper allows you to spray bullet walls of crits when your firing speed and clip capacity are high.  Both do very, very well with penetration.

Starting out against giants, use the Fan of War instead of the Sand Man.  After you have enough money to spend on it, switch to and upgrade your sandman for mark for death and multiple balls.  It will allow you to mark enemies from a safe distance.

Upgrade for 35% slowing movement speed and use milk against large groups of enemies, or exceptionally strong(Giant heavies, demos, soldiers, pyros) or fast, durable enemies(Giant Scouts).   Use bonk for games with early waves of high damage spawns(eg. Huge groups of soldiers, demos, heavies) to distract enemies and collect money more safely.  Despite being healed by money-grabbing, it's still nearly impossible to survive 12+ simultaneous rockets.   Milk is your best friend over-all, but Bonk has its place at the start of the game.

**Scout Breakdown:**

- Kill high priority targets, such as bomb carriers and medics.
- Get money, get paid.
- Consider using the Soda Popper or the Force a' Nature for your primary.
- Start with Fan of War, spend cash on Sandman.
- Start with Bonk, use cash on Milk

---------------------------------------

**Soldier**

*Blow them up real good.*

Consider your primary, and prepare to stick to it.

All of the soldier's rocket launchers are powerful in their own degree, but all suffer from a similar weakness.  Reload speed and clip capacity.  Consider the following weapons with upgrades.

The Bazooka deals incredible burst damage, add a crit canteen and you're a man-sized roman candle of death.  If you're joined by a kritz medic, be sure to tell him what your ammo max is so he understands when to use his kritz for maximum effectiveness.  As you reload, he can switch to another player, then back to you before you use your rockets again.  Communication with your team makes this weapon a wave crusher.

For the soldier on the move, or in a team without a medic, the Black Box is a fantastic choice over the other rocket launchers. If you're a fan of rocket jumping, the healing per hit and on kill will make it a small task to keep healthy and keep mobile.  The better you are at rocket jumping the happier you'll be with this weapon.  A faster reloading and a faster firing Black Box gives the soldier significant endurance when dealing with enemy fire.

The Direct Hit is a great balance between burst damage and control.  Focus on reload speed early on, then damage and a larger clip for more sustained damage.  In later waves, especially against giants and tanks, use crit canteens to ramp damage up.  Extremely fast reload speeds make the need for a larger clip a secondary concern, but 6 shots gives a nice cushion for mistakes or a sudden need to rocket jump or change targets.

Weapons, in Short:

- **Beggar's Bazooka**: *Much Burst* Prioritize: Balance Larger Clips with Reload Speed, then damage.

- **The Black Box**: *Be Hard to Kill* Prioritize: 5 Shots, Faster Reload and Firing Speed, Health on Kill, More than 5 Shots, Damage

- **The Direct Hit**: *Control and Power* Prioritize Faster Reload Speed, Firing Speed, 6 Shots, Damage, Larger Clip(More than 6 shots)

Good soldiers know how to juggle enemy players.  You can do that with robots, too.  Plant a rocket near the feet of the bomb carrier, opposite of the direction you want him to fly and watch him soar.  This is handy for when your team might not have a pyro available, and you're on a map such as Decoy or Coal works where there are significant opportunities to restart or send back the bomb.  This isn't effective on giants, so save it for the little guys.

The Buff Banner is a solid choice for a secondary, though the Concheror will fill up faster and will help give endurance for your team.  As the enemies become more deadly, the Concheror becomes less and less effective if your team doesn't also build up their resistances to bullets, explosives and(if applicable, fire.)  The Buff Banner is useful throughout the entire game, allowing a full 133% damage to enemies at any range, and great for attacking tanks.


**Soldier Breakdown:**

- Blow things up, deploy banners to support your team.
- Pick your Rocket Launcher and stick to it.
- Juggle small robots with your rocket launcher if you don't have a pyro.

---------------------------------------

**Pyro**

*Apparently, robots are flammable.*

Pyros are, since air blasting was added, masters of utility.  Your biggest job is knowing your role for each wave.  Some waves, you will mop up large groups of rock-em, sock-em heavies.  Other waves, you'll be keeping Giant Scouts within sentry-gun range, or collecting money from dead enemies too far away for your heavier, slower friends to get.  This also means you need to understand priorities and ammo conservation too.  Giant Scouts will almost always need your attention, or most of your team's attention.  Enemy medics, especially uber medics, should either be killed quickly or kept away from their heal targets.  Coordinate with your engineer to decide whether he will need help with sentry busters, though make sure he understands how to deal with it on his own.  Lastly, use pits, bridges, and steep drops to delay bomb carriers.

Also: You probably can't reflect all of those rockets/grenades. Seriously, there are 12 soldiers/2 rapid fire soldiers/12 demos/2 rapid fire demos.   You might get lucky and catch most of them, but something WILL hit you.  Don't kill yourself for the thrill of a mass reflect kill, especially when you need to stay alive to stop a Giant Scout.

If you're focusing on a tank, and enemies are along one side of it, use the tank for cover and flame throw through the tank and towards the robots.  You'll damage the tank and hurt the robots on the opposite side.  This only works across the width and corners of the tank, not the length.

**Pyro Breakdown:**

- You have about a thousand roles. Know how to prioritize them.
- Don't try to be the air blast hero on soldier/demo waves.  One errand twitch, and kablooey!
- Use the tank as cover and burn enemies on the other side of it.

---------------------------------------

**Demo**

*Kaboom!*

Loch n' Load or Grenade Launcher?

The Loch N' Load comes with 2 fewer shots, no rollers, and 25% more damage.  The grenade launcher can output a higher amount of damage provided it is upgraded fully, but many people may find the LnL to be easier to aim.  If you're not comfortable with the grenade launcher, the LNL is a good substitute.  Upgrade the ammo capacity and reload speed quickly, and you'll be set.

Sticky Launcher or Scottish Resistance?

The Sticky Launcher is a safe weapon.  The Scottish Resistance has, without question, higher damage potential, the Sticky Launcher is a more flexible weapon, being that it can be used for direct offense (Airbursts) or as a trap.  If you have a team that you trust to handle uncertain circumstances, you will benefit more from the Scottish Resistance.  If you find yourself the main person to respond to sudden changes in the flow of the game, the stock sticky launcher will be a quicker mode of travel and damage source.  In either case, you should be using your sticky launcher to deal massive damage to incoming waves, and priority targets like Uber Medics.

To Be Demoknight or Not to be?

If you have to ask, the answer is probably no.  That said, Demoknights can be viable for Mann Up games, but their role is different.  It's important to be able to aim with your grenade launcher/LNL while playing with a shield + large melee weapon, since you'll need to be able to effectively use the crits(via upgrade you earn from melee kills.  The shield, combined with upgraded resistances, can make you  tough to kill with explosives, especially if you're using the targe over the screen.  Be careful(and distant) with heavies, and upgrade your charge for quick ins-and-outs to grab money and score crits.


**Demoman Breakdown:**

- Figure out your loadout
- Deal enormous burst damage with sticky traps.
- It's safer not to be a demoknight.

I was alright, I joined a clan, and saw some competitive play.

As time went by others in my clan wanted to learn how to play spy so we asked the best spy in our clan to give us a sort of one day spy-boot-camp. The camp went like this, and since that time I have improved with the spy ten-fold with his advice.

All of us enter our server, chatting waiting for out spy guru to arrive. He enters the server and says, ""You guys wanna be better spies? One tip for ya, use your fuckin' gun. Use it all the damn time. I'm always watchin' people play spy and everyone just stabs. Use your fuckin' gun. Class dismissed."" Then he left the server.

To this day, this has been some of the best spy advice I can give new players. The default revolver is amazing! Depending on your play style you can pick a different gun that will help you even more. In terms of accuracy and damage, the spy's guns are fantastic.

'Players that attempt to crouch during the fall will inadvertantly suffer more damage than if they had remained standing upright. This is because crouching results in the player's bounding box becoming smaller and therefore higher off the ground. This creates a greater height distance between the character and the ground. Conversely, a player who crouches just before leaving a ledge surface who then proceeds to stand in mid-air will have shortened his potential fall distance.

**What is...**

**Medieval Mode?**

Medieval mode is a mode of gameplay that limits your weapon usage, narrowing it down to a handful of secondary weapons, and all of the melee weapons.

**Melee Mode?**

Another mode, often confused with medieval mode, is melee mode.  This mode restricts players to *only* melee weapons.  This mode is typically enforced by custom server mods.


On to the guide.

-----

**The Scout Overview**

The Medieval Mode scout is incredibly hard to kill when played defensively.  Thanks to their enormous speed and double jumps, they can escape any encounter without much fear of retribution.  They can bring combat healing to your team by throwing Mad Milk at enemies and enemy clusters. They are frail and will often die in 2 melee hits from enemies.


**Recommended Loadouts**

**Load out #1:**

* Secondary: Mad Milk
* Melee: Candy Cane

In Medieval Mode, every enemy slain drops a health kit.  The candy cane will drop two health kits when you kill someone.

**Load out #2:**

* Secondary: Mad Milk
* Melee: Sun on a Stick

If you have a pyro on your team using the sharpened volcano fragment, you could use Sun on a Stick and follow him around.  Your rapid attacks combined with his ability to set enemies on fire turns you into a crit-batting machine.

**Load out #3: **

* Secondary: Mad Milk
* Melee: Sandman

If you're any good with connecting sandman baseballs, use the sandman.  The reduced health is a pain, but it can let you stun enemies while your allies are fighting them, to give them a chance to either escape or finish them off.

-----

**The Pyro Overview**

The pyro comes into Medieval mode as a rather hardy character.  His naturally moderate-high health allows him to soak 3 melee hits before dying.  Without his flame thrower or a Sharpened Volcano Fragment, he cannot set enemies on fire.  The pyro is a fairly standard fighter, and doesn't has many ways to synergize with his team outside of beating skulls and lighting people on fire for the scout to crit.

**Recommended Loadouts**

*(Section that was previously here has been edited out.  Information included was changed/patched by Valve.  Thanks for the correction, Mail2345)*

* The Back Scratcher

Since this weapon allows you to gain more health out of health kits, this is anothero weapon to consider if you do not have the full Gas Jockey set.  Medics cannot use their medigun in Medieval mode, so the downside is, again, negated.


* Sharpened Volcano Fragment

The Volcano fragment is a good menacing weapon.  Connecting the axe to a scout or a medic is a high priority, since it will either force the scout to use his mad milk to extinguish himself, or menace the medic who is unable to heal himself outside of health packs.  This weapon synergizes well with the Scout's Sun on a Stick.

-----

**The Heavy Overview**

*It is good day to be giant man.* The heavy is a slow, but incredibly tough in melee combat.  He is one of the two classes that can survive a melee crit, and the only class that can survive a melee crit and a follow-up melee hit.  Due to his slow speed, the heavy cannot effectively chase down enemies without the proper load out.  Once the heavy is on a point, either defending or attacking, he is hard to get off it.

**Recommended Loadouts**

*(Section that was previously here has been edited out.  Information included was changed/patched by Valve.  Thanks for the correction, Mail2345)*

**Load out #2:**

* Secondary: Buffalo Steak Sandvich

* Melee: Killing Gloves of Boxing

This particular load out is at its best when a heavy is among numerous enemies.  If the Bufflo Steak Sandvich is eaten prior to combat, the heavy will have increased movement speed(which puts him at 99% run speed, or just *slightly* slower than the pyro.)  The Killing Gloves of Boxing attack slower than the heavy's other fist weapons, but it is offset by the fact that killing anyone with the gloves grants the heavy 5 seconds of critical hits.  Each kill during the 5 seconds of crits refreshes the duration back to 5 seconds.

The Killing Gloves of Boxing is one of the few weapons that has both predictable and random crits.  Because of this, the heavy has a relatively high chance of scoring a kill and turning into a wrecking ball.  Since the buffalo steak sandvich can be eaten prior to getting a kill, you can use the speed of the sandvich and the crits of the boxing gloves to demolish enemy pushes.  In a spot, you can also drop the sandvich to use it to heal yourself, instead of consuming it for the crits and speed bonus.

* Has 125 HP and is considered a light class.
* Moves at 100% speed, and is only slower than the medic and scout.
* Uses a resource called Metal. 
* Creates **Dispensers**, which replenish health, ammo, and steadily provide metal to engineers.
* Creates **Teleporters**, which assist players getting to key areas.
* Creates **Sentries**, which provide unparalleled area control and lock down.
* Capable of upgrading buildings to increase their effectiveness(Up to level 3).
* Capable of carrying and relocating buildings to more crucial areas, at the cost of a severe speed penalty(-25% movement speed.)  If killed while carrying a building, the building is instantly destroyed.
* Capable of climbing on his buildings to reach harder to access areas.
* The Wrangler(a secondary weapon) allows the engineer to bullet and rocket jump to hard to reach areas at the severe cost of health.
* Has the largest secondary weapon ammo reserve(200 reserve shots with his pistol)
* Benefits more from extensive game knowledge than from raw skill.
* Stock weapons include the Shotgun(Primary), the pistol, and the wrench.

**Their roles in a team are...**

* Establishing and maintaining a second line for front-line combatants to retreat to.
* Repairing friendly buildings and removing enemy sappers.
* Provide teams with quick access to crucial areas.
* Locking down crucial areas or choke points.
* Protecting gear(and potentially other players) from enemy spies.
* Providing the team Texan flavored charm, solutions to practical problems and the occasional tune.

**They excel at...**

* Area control and defense
* Team support
* Short to Medium Ranged combat(Shotgun)

**Vulnerable to...**

* Snipers, when stationary or repairing friendly buildings.
* Spies, when repairing a friendly building.
* Ubercharged enemies, since they are often the targets of uber-rushes or pushes.
* Everyone else except the medic, if caught one-on-one without a sentry for support.
* Their own sentries.  Sentries can hurt their creators if they are between the sentry gun and its target.

**A few words about the Engineer... **

The engineer, despite his friendly demeanor and support oriented features, is not highly recommended for players just beginning the game.  While this guide will help prepare you for the troubled roads ahead, nothing will prepare you better for the job as an engineer quite like experience with other classes and game/map knowledge.

On to the guide.

**Understanding the second line.**

The purpose of having a second line is having a mid-way point between respawn and the front line of combat.  The second line allows players who are severely injured from the front line to **retreat, recover, and return**(**The 3 R's**) to the front line, and allows players that have just died to teleport quickly to the second line from spawn.  The engineer, along with defensive minded/loaded players(IE: Homewrecker pyro, or Brass Beast Heavy) largely make up what is known as the second line.

Without a second line of defense, your front-line players can find themselves being overwhelmed by enemy teams.  This is especially true in games that have different spawn times for attackers and defenders, where attackers frequently have a constant spawn advantage over defenders.  The second line of defense also prevents enemy flankers from gaining a positional advantage(IE: scouts hitting front liners from the back or side) or sneaking by and capturing points behind your team.

To be clear, the second line usually starts at, or just before the first point(or just after, for offensive engineers.  Offensive engineers will also move their gear up to re-establish the second line each time another point is captured, and will rebuild teleporters if the spawn point moves.)

**Building and Upgrading**

As you may have noticed in the overview, the engineer uses Metal as a resource.    He starts with 200 metal that can be restored in a variety of ways, such as collecting weapons of dead players(enemy and friendly, roughly 100 metal a piece) and by collecting the various ammo boxes in the game.

I recommend that you go through the tutorials for the engineer in the game, as I won't cover content that is included there: I assume you know how to upgrade and build using the build tool.

I would recommend that you assign special keys to your keyboard to speed up the process of which you select which objects to build, as you need as much time as you can muster to build an effective second line.  [Check out my guide on customizing your controls](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/k1p7z/this_fits_me_like_a_hat_a_guide_to_customizing/) for details on how to do that.

*For games with setup:*

It is considered standard to build your teleporter entrance at the start of a game(either defense or offense), then either restock in the spawn room, or collect metal on your way to the second line.  The exit and dispenser are generally the next two things that go up, with the sentry gun going up and getting upgraded just before the game starts.  Many people will argue different orders of building up, and for the most part, they're right to some degree or another.  Some favor building and upgrading the sentry before putting the teleporter exit down, others favor upgrading the dispenser, then using it to build and upgrade everything.  *All valid.*  **The important thing is that all of your gear is up and ready before the time your team really needs it.**

-----

**Location, Location, Location!**

Location is often the key to being a successful engineer.  What I will teach you will not be ""The best places to put sentry guns in Dustbowl.""  Instead, I will teach you what makes places good places or bad places to be. 

Though, if you really want map specific tips, check out some of the posts [Juicyjames](http://www.reddit.com/user/juicyjames/submitted/) has done in [R/TF2](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2), as they're quite well put together and will give you some good starter ideas on how to handle other maps.

Ask yourself these questions when you consider putting your gear somewhere:

* Is my sentry in plain sight?
* Is my sentry **not** covering enemy objectives or protecting my team?
* Can my sentry be out-ranged?
* Can my sentry be edged/peeked?
* Can my sentry be splash damaged?
* Can my sentry be ambushed?
* Can my sentry be fired on from around cover?

The more of these you answer ""Yes"" to, the worse the placement of your sentry.

The truth of the game is that there will be few places where your sentry will answer 'No' to all of those questions.  The ultimate goal of placing a sentry well is forcing your enemy team to build a time-consuming uber-charge to deal with it.  All your team needs to do then is kill medics on sight, and that area will be safe.

**Enemy of an Enemy is a Friend Indeed.**

Don't be afraid to talk to your team about your sentry's weaknesses.  If you and other people understand where your team is weak, they can help make it stronger.

Lets go back over those questions, shall we?

1310005674.0,29,self.NewToTF2,iinpo,A few tips on sniping for noobies,insomniavision,32,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/iinpo/a_few_tips_on_sniping_for_noobies/,"So, F2P'ers have gotten a lot of heat lately for gravitating towards spy and sniper, two notoriously difficult classes.  Ideally, there should be less spies and snipers about, but I know a lot of you genuinely want to become decent at it.  Since there's already a few guides to spies (and because I'm not much good at them anyways), here's a few tips to avoid being a stereotypical noob-sniper and actually be useful to your team.


*1)Does the team need a sniper?*

Snipers are most useful on defense.  If there's already two snipers on your team...another one is probably not going to help.  But, if your team is in need of a sniper, you can be very, very useful.  As for offense, snipers are less useful...but not useless.  You should probably be bringing up the rear, picking off threats up ahead before your team reaches them.  This can be especially useful for taking out sentry nests by capping off the engineer from afar and taking out the sentries before they can be repaired.  Also, you shouldn't be anywhere near another sniper.  Two of you on the same platform is just plain redundant, when one of you could be covering another area.

*2) Long-range tactics*

Still, sniping's mostly a defensive/support class.  Find a place where you have decent cover, but where you can see multiple entrances.  If you're playing a control point/payload level, make sure you're in sight of the target.  You should be as far away from the action as possible while still being able to cover a broad range.  Next, learn to prioritize.  If you've got multiple enemies in sight, figure out which ones are going to cause the most trouble for your teammates to take down.  If a heavy is by the cart/cp, take him out with a headshot before he sees you.  BUT, if that heavy is being tailed by a medic, kill the medic first.  Also, keep a close watch on your teammates.  If one of them is being dogged by an enemy, help them out.  Your job is to support your teammates, not be a lone-wolf killing machine.

*3)On your feet*

Snipers are very weak, low on health, slow-moving and atrocious at close-quarters combat.  Avoid it at all costs, even if your team is making an offensive push.  Still, there are few places a sniper can get to that your enemies cannot, so be prepared to switch to melee at any moment.  You should already have it turned on, but go into the advanced options and turn on ""fast weapon switching"".  Only zoom in if you have a target and you're trying to line up a shot.   Otherwise you'll need your peripheral vision to see an enemy approaching you.  If one does, immediately switch to your melee weapon.  Skip over the SMG, it's pretty much useless.  Don't try to run, you won't get away.  Stay and start swinging your melee weapon like there's no tomorrow, and you *might* kill them before they kill you.

*4) Damn spies...*

As a sniper, spies are pretty much your nemesis.  You're mostly stationary, slow-moving, and spend a decent amount of time with no peripheral vision.  Keep your back to the wall at all times so you can't be backstabbed.  If you see an ally coming even slightly too close to you, be suspicious.  Get out your melee weapon and watch them until they go away.  Shoot them if they stick around too long.  And most of all, listen for the spy's decloaking sound.

*5) Damn snipers...*

Snipers love to pick off other snipers.  When you first arrive at a new vantage point, scan the horizon for enemy snipers.  If you see one looking right at you, move your ass.  Get behind cover.  Do not try to shoot him.  He's probably already sighted you in and was nanoseconds away from capping you.  Only once you've gotten out of his line of fire should you peek out from behind your cover and try to get him before he gets you.

*6) Communicate*

This goes from pretty much everyone, but especially snipers.  You've got a unique way of seeing things others on your team might not be able to.  Enemy flanks, sentry nests ahead, that sort of thing.  Press 'u' to enter team chat, and let your pals know what's up ahead.  If you see a spy disguise himself and start toward your team or their defenses, let them know (after you've tried to kill him, of course).

Well, this was just a disorganized ramble.  I've probably left out vital information, so if you have any further questions, please ask.  I'd love to help.  There's a lot of snipers out there right now, and the more they know, the better all our games will be.

Also, to the more experienced players here, I don't claim to be the high-mucky muck of snipers, so if anyone wants to add something or call me on my bullshit, feel free to do that too.

Most importantly, have fun.  Sniping's a good job, mate.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_iinpo,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/iinpo/a_few_tips_on_sniping_for_noobies/,
1309122551.0,30,self.NewToTF2,i9rwz,Credit to Team! - Tips from a veteran medic,,34,4,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/i9rwz/credit_to_team_tips_from_a_veteran_medic/,"I've been a medic player since 2008, we medics are are a rare breed, with most teams either having people switching in and out of medic or lacking one altogether. But the people who do play medic adamantly usually do it very well, and when a good medic joins your server, it can turn the tide for a team within a round. We medics usually top the score charts, due to the fact that we're constantly gaining points while healing people, and when we're on and rockin', it's rare to see the MVP chart without a medic. But in the end, the most rewarding part, for me, I think, is when you've just healed someone and they take the time to hit the Z+2 button to yell, ""Thanks!""

But the path of the medic involves a lot of dying, a lot of frustration when you get die with a fully-charged uber, when your patient is an incompetent, deaf and mute slab of meat, a lot of teamwork between medics themselves, and a lot of teammates yelling at you for not healing. But after the medic experience, you'll also be a bit better at scouting, heavy-ing and pyroing, since these are the classes that involves positioning, tactics, damage-avoiding, and being able to rapidly turn around and click on something; they don't require a lot of aiming or timing, like the sniper or soldier. Medic is also great for noobs due to the fact that you get to have someone lead you, so you learn the game a lot quicker, plus you get to learn the game through the eyes of a team-player, which is always good for the community in general.



**Dying and survival:**

* You're a very important asset to the team. EVERYONE on the other team will want to try and kill you. Every bit of your tiny, teeny 125-150 health counts, and 20 seconds of respawn + 10 seconds of walking means a lot of healing (30 25 = 750HP!) and a lot ubermeter not charged, in addition to the ubermeter you've lost. DO NOT DIE.

* You're important, so use the crap out of those teleporters. If a scout tries to use the teleporter before you,  crouch down, and push him the fuck off that teleporter. He can run to the front lines before the TP even recharges, scouts DON'T need to use the teleporter.

* At the first sign of an enemy kritz shitstorm, even if someone just reports it over mic or chat and you still haven't seen it, run the hell away. Those damn krit stickies kill you in one hit, and the demoman won't care how much you whine. Also, try reporting it over your mic or voice commands once you feel safe enough to be able to concentrate on doing that.

**When you heal:**

* If you're not using the mic, spam the crap out of voice commands. Prominently the C+1 command, which says ""Help!"", X+1 = ""Incoming!"" and the X+2 = ""Spy!"". Look out for your buddy when he's too distracted to pay attention to his soft, virgin backbone. Randomly turn around every once in a while and try to bump into teammates if they're close. When you feel a spy, STOP HEALING and pull out your ubersaw to stab the shit out of that frenchman. Your patient will notice something is wrong, and you'll have a chance to block the spy's path to your heavy's delicious back.

* You can get a charged uber up in around 40 seconds and a charged kritz or quick-fix up in around 30 seconds. Healing injured teammates will charge your gun much faster than healing teammates with full health. So have your demoman or soldier injure themselves can help build an uber fast. Healing teammates also healed by another medic or a dispenser will also lower your uber charge rate. Healing teammates that have been injured for a while (and taken no damage after) will be very fast, whereas healing recent wounds is very slow. This is to encourage fall back to heal rather than suicide and respawn. However, since your buddies heal much faster, your uber will charge slower, so choose wisely.

* If you're with a good, bulky team in the front lines, try to spread your healing as evenly as possible. This could cause your teammates to be less discouraged to run back when hurt, thinking you're healing only one person. Once your patient is healed, try healing other people. Very often you'll have a wave of teammates running back on red health, on fire, etc. Heal people on fire first. Try to heal them all at once, so that everyone will be at 50%, then 75%, then 100%, etc. spread your healing powers so people don't get discouraged. This way you also charge your uber faster, and the whole team stays together, which makes the team strong.

* If you're on a team without a lot of medics, but with a lot of injured people, tell other people to medic! Raise the concern over mic or over chat. People usually aren't dull wits, and sometimes having another medic, even for a little bit, can go a long way.

* If you have a suicidal patient who thinks he can take on all the enemies with his baby fists, just leave him. He'll learn his lesson. Don't blindly follow patients who think they know what they're doing. Assess the situation and remember that your life is more important than his.

**Other medics:**

* Heal other medics before patients. A medic is not consider healed unless he's overhealed to his 225 health. That means if you're lucky enough to not be the only medic, heal the crap out of that other medic. He'll also be less discouraged to play the class, as well. One medic is worth quite a few meatslabs, so unless you're ubering someone, heal other hurt medics.

* When another medic starts his kritzkrig, either heal him or heal his patient, depending on who's in danger of dying. If his patient is definitely going to die, at least save the medic. When people are kritz'ed they're both very powerful and vulnerable, since the entire enemy team will focus on them, so heal them. The medic is especially targeted, as well, so follow kritz if it's safe to, and help heal. The pair will thank you for it. Also try to get your team to push out with other ubers as well as your own ubers. While the uber can absorb the sentry damage, the rest of the team can deal it right back, making an ""uber push"" especially effective.

**When you're charged: &gt;:D**

* When you actually get your Ubercharge up, make sure that once you deploy it, you don't break the connection. Any re-connection will chew up your uber a little. This is to discourage medics from ubering multiple targets by spamming the click button. 

* If you're ubered and trying to take out a sentry with your heavy or demoman buddy, take into account the recoil of the sentry bullets. They limit the distance that your buddy can fire from, and in addition to losing accuracy of boolets, damage per bullet also drops with distance. Run up to the sentry gun with your body to block his recoil so he can move forward. This could mean the difference between triumphantly taking down a lvl3 sentry gun and a sentry in your killcam.

* There's enough time at the beginning of payload round to charge your uber before gates open. Usually what most foolish medics will do (actually if you're not careful, you might actually fall for it) is that they'll uber a pyro at the beginning of a round, when all of BLU is at their spawn. This is usually pretty cool, but in my opinion a waste of red's uber. It's very easy for people to respawn at their spawn, and for engies to rebuild their crap at spawn. The ideal red uber is when blu all pushes out at once, or if they have a sentry set up, etc. Save your uber or kritz till the best time, don't use it in the beginning. And be careful of kritz-demo or uber-pyro at the beginning of a round when you're BLU.

* When you're ubered, watch out for pyros, they can blow you away with their airblast and leave both of you two useless. Also, don't jump into sentries, and by jump I mean literally jump. If you're in mid air, recoil is x1000. Try staying ahead of or even inside your uber target, so that if you get blasted away, at least he'll know. A very dangerous situation occurs when you two get separated.

**Battle medic:**

* Battle medic-ing is for when your team is at a comfortable enough position for you to battle-medic. This means that you have sentries and dispensers set up to fall back on, your team is fairly healed, you have good heavies and soldiers on your team dealing most of the damage, you have more than just one medic, and you're really not doing much by healing people. OR, if none of these suffice, if your team is super-incompetent, and you feel you can do a better job yourself (one of those rounds you know you're going to lose).

* Battle medic-ing usually involves using the blautsauger and ubersaw. Other people prefer other items, but for blautsauger it's easy to get your health back, and the quick speed of the needles in addition to your own fast run speed, can allow you to ninja on an opponent before they're fully aware of what's going on. Using the ubersaw is common because it builds ubers quickly. When you're battle medic-ing it's very much like playing spy. You're trying to distract the opposing team by attacking them when they're focused on something else. Medics should never take on someone face-on unless they're a spy, sniper, or a scout in a narrow space. Always go behind people and try to sneak attack. I have seen quite a few medics fighting on the front lines, but IMO they're much less effective than sneaky BMs.

* You run very quickly, faster than everyone except for the scount. Which means if you backpedal and spam your needle gun or blautsauger, you'll probably be able to get away and maybe even kill your pursuer (very common for pyro cuz they just run in a straight line).

Lastly, there's useful options in Muitplayer -&gt; Advanced for medics, such as auto-yelling-medic for injured teammates and healing without holding down mouse.

Last, lastly, in case you haven't noticed, you only see the medic bubbles if you're playing medic :p

TrampolineTales: hi :)

TrampolineTales: how much for your strange scattergun?

Crossbow Dash: I'm not sure, still trying to figure out what all my stranges are worth!

TrampolineTales: can you show me what you're willing to sell?

TrampolineTales had asked to trade with you, but you did not respond in time.

Crossbow Dash: Probably nothing yet, trying to get a feel for what things are worth first ya know?

TrampolineTales: I can give you a lot of metal for some of them

TrampolineTales: I'm particularly interested in the minigun, the rocket launcher, the scattergun, and the gunslinger

TrampolineTales: oh, and the machina

TrampolineTales had asked to trade with you, but you did not respond in time.

Crossbow Dash: Right, I gotcha. I need to see what they are worth before I make trades. Not sure if the machina is worth just metal, or like a million keys for instance.

TrampolineTales: ah

TrampolineTales: I can do something to get you started with some keys if you like

TrampolineTales: how about 20 refined for those items?

TrampolineTales: I'll throw in a key for the krizkrieg if you like

TrampolineTales had asked to trade with you, but you did not respond in time.

Crossbow Dash: That actually sounds great.

TrampolineTales: awesome

Crossbow Dash: Except the machina alone should be pulling 20 something keys, and the s kritz should be worth 13 keys or so.

TrampolineTales is now playing Team Fortress 2. Click here to join.

TrampolineTales: not really

TrampolineTales: that's from like months ago

TrampolineTales had asked to trade with you, but you did not respond in time.

TrampolineTales: do you want to trade?

TrampolineTales: we'll work out a price you like, but I'd really like those items

Crossbow Dash: Well lets examine the gap. You offered a key, kritz sold (months ago?) for 16 keys. That's a hefty depreciation.

TrampolineTales: do you want to trade so we can work this out?

TrampolineTales had asked to trade with you, but you did not respond in time.

TrampolineTales: how much do you want for all of them?

Crossbow Dash: Not in the least dude. When you start like that I can't believe a word you say.

TrampolineTales: do you want to sell your weapons or not?

Crossbow Dash: 20 ref for those items is REALLY TERRIBLE. and you would have done it.

TrampolineTales: you're not gonna sell them just by asking how much they're worth

Crossbow Dash: :) I put that post up and had you offering on them in 45 seconds. I think I'll be ok overall, there are lots of places to sell them once I make sure of prices.

TrampolineTales: do you want to trade or not?

Crossbow Dash: Of course not, but I'm really looking forward to putting this chat on reddit for everyone to laugh at.

TrampolineTales: you think people will find it funny that I'm trying to get a low price for items?

TrampolineTales: that's what everyone does

Crossbow Dash: The audacity of offering to ""throw in"" the key for the Kritz was the best part. Good luck with everything man!

1317954407.0,28,self.NewToTF2,l3pgd,Heavy Guide.,Whellopeople,29,1,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/l3pgd/heavy_guide/,"Like the Pyro guide, the aim of this guide is to give you some pointers which will hopefully increase your performance.

Loadouts:
Offensive Heavy
-Sasha for medium damage, highest revspeed, and highest walking capability, it won't slow you down like the Brass Beast or take forever to start shooting like Natascha.
-Sandvich for emergency healing for both yourself and your medic. I find the shotgun useless as anything Sasha cannot take down will not be taken down by such a little weapon. Use the shotgun if you get into a lot of retreating situations where you need to put some covering fire while you run away. Otherwise, stay with Sandvich ESPECIALLY if your medic finds you a good healing partner! Dalokohs bar is plain useless, and the steak sandvich, while tasty, isn't much help unless you just want to kamikize blindly-which won't net you many kills.
-Any except maybe Warrior's Spirit due to health loss. The main differences are how many times you get into melee situations. Use GRU if you find many breaks in the battle to charge an uber for the Medic. (Make sure he realizes this though.) Fists of Steel are also good if you need to run away a lot but run with your back to them so they can't see your gun-shield.

Tips: Ambush, the sneakier you are the higher damage output and it's pretty scary to know that there's a deadly Heavy sneaking around your base. Psychological effect is ALWAYS nice.

Defensive Heavy
-Natascha. As a defensive heavy your goal should be to keep them off the cart/point/intelligence/sandvich, not to get kills. Natascha will slow people down so others can get kills, and you'll get assists-also good for scouts running off with the intel, or any other class for that matter. Use Sasha, though, if everyone's murdering you-you're no use dead, after all!
-Sandvich-Again, shotgun is usually useless and you'll be with your team most of the time anyway, so you won't need that much help and you'll have all the help (and health) you need from alt-firing it and getting half of your health instantly!
-Fists because at that range you want to take the attacker down quickly.

Tips: Focus on Scouts, twice the speed/capturing speed and they're fast enough to disorient you if they get close enough and surprise you.

-

General Tips: Sandvich is usually the best secondary you can get. Emergency HP for your medic, yourself, and your team gets anyone back in the fight instantly, while shotgun has a tendency to miss unless you're spot on because it's fired in a box effect. If you aim for the arm, you'll do 3-10 damage, so sandvich is better without insane accuracy.
-Use any advantage you can get. Hide behind the payload cart to dodge bullets or hide, crawl along the tunnel walls in Dustbowl, etc. Cover is good, fear is good, killing is good.
-Stay calm. Unlike maybe Pyro, Soldier, or Demoman, shooting randomly in fear won't net you anything but death. The minigun is inaccurate so you need precise aiming.
-Check your back! Don't get Tunnel Vision. Check at the end of your uber. Check in corridors. Check your back everywhere-you're slow, you're huge, and there might be a medic next to you.
-Pay attention to the medic tooltip. If it disconnects or if he starts taking damage, rev up and look behind you just in case. BUT, don't do this in a fight. He might've gotten hurt by the enemy's bullets or ran away.
-The Medic's life IS more important than yours. If the enemy is pushing in and your medic has ran away by use of a hallway, stand in it to prevent progress temporarily. If that medic has an uber and lives, he can push them out!


-

VS Class
Scout - Be careful with this one. He's your polar opposite and one of the three-four banes of your existence. Focus on him before anything, because the closer he is the more disorienting. Keep in mind that you have a lot of health. Stay on your minigun, he's too fast for you to dish out your sandvich and your minigun will cut him down faster anyway. Keep at medium range.

Soldier - Not too hard unless you're far away. Keep in medium range, a test I have done, at a range just out of the Soldier's self-hurt with vanilla weaponry shows that the Soldier will win with 10-40 hitpoints left. Even rockets decay at range but your bullets fire faster, so you'll likely come on top especially if you stay calm and keep your accuracy.

Pyro - Keep at medium-long range. If he has an axtinguisher he'll be very deadly at close range and cannot dish out damage out of close range. Also another reason to check your back, any smart Pyro will flank you.

Demoman - We have a problem here. You're too slow to dodge his stickies and he has the highest damage output in the game. However, they're usually not that smart until you start playing tf2lobby or go competitive. Shoot at him and go side to side at the same time, his projectiles from his primary ARE slow enough for you to dodge if you can predict him-which will come with practice. Most demomen just fling all of their ammo at you immediately, so try zig-zagging. Also, the closer the better if you zig-zag, highest damage output and medium hitpoints means he might just kill himself!

Heavy - Really, it bores down to this: Range, medic, crits, who fired first,which minigun you both have, team awareness (Heavy is a team player), Cover (if I've got 50% cover I'm going to kill a Heavy who spins up before me unless we're at point blank. There's a couple of spots where one can fire from 75% cover, from there I'll go head to head with a heavy/medic combo and win, Escape routes (if you don't over commit then a Heavy can often escape another Heavy),Pre-fight sandvich throwdown 450 health &gt; 300 health.

Engineer - Probably the least dangerous class you can encounter, if you can't take this guy down at full health I will be very sad for you. Medium speed, medium hitpoints, medium damage output versus lowest speed, highest hitpoints, and one of the highest damage outputs as well as attack speed.

Engineer's Sentry - You may think you're tough enough to take on a level three sentry. Surprisingly, you aren't-it's hard to take them down even with a medic, even when ubered! Try to get out of it's range and shoot it from afar-any bullet you hit it with has maximum damage output. If it's impossible, you might have to search for another route or switch classes. Depending on your skill/luck/skill of enemy engineer, this can be the third bane of your existence.

Medic - Like Engineer, not very dangerous. You'll probably take him down.

Battle Medic - I have problems with their Blutsauger. Stay calm and try to keep your crosshair on them at a medium range and you'll probably get them.

Medic's Patient - If they haven't seen you, kill the medic as fast as you can. If you die doing so, you still contributed because they just lost their uber. Heck, you might have just turned the tide of the entire game. If they have seen you, run away or get behind them.

Uber/Kritz Patient - Run away. You can't do anything to them. Or, you could equip a GRU and run in front of them like a nut and keep their attention. This is very risky though, so if it's Arena or if your server/map has a really long respawn time, run away.

Sniper - If he has the Huntsman, jump whenever he tries to hit you. If he aims for the head, he hits your chest. If he aims for the chest, he hits your legs or maybe even misses. If you crouch, he might accidentally hit you in the head. Usually, he's at a really long range. You cannot stop him at long range, so it's best to jump and run unpredictably across the battlefield until you're safe.

Spy - The final bane of your existence, the Spy can take an unprepared Heavy down instantly. Assume that there is always one stalking you and look behind you constantly. I suggest looking back, jumping, and revving up simultaneously. If you can catch him, you will beat him.

1309799388.0,24,self.NewToTF2,igi35,3 Tips for New Players (xpost from tf2),strengths,35,11,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/igi35/3_tips_for_new_players_xpost_from_tf2/,"I'm not sure how many actually new players will see this, but I've noticed a few things that new players could do to vastly improve gameplay:


***1)  Play the right classes for your team.***


This is by far the most important advice I can give.

Here are the classes in order of credit to team:

1. Medic

2. Soldier, Demo

3. Heavy, Engineer, Scout, Pyro

5. Spy, Sniper

Pick your class based on this, for example:

* If your team does not have a medic, you will lose.
* Your team never needs more than 2 spies (1 good spy).
* Your team never needs more than 2 snipers (1 good sniper).
* Your team never needs more than 2 engies on offense, maybe 3 on defense.

The way these classes (sniper, spy, engie) work is that their efficiency is greatly reduced with each additional player playing those classes. There are rare circumstances in which a team that works together can win without a medic or with a bunch of these extra classes, but that doesn't happen that often.


***2) Use the right weapons.***


When in doubt, use the stock weapons; baring some exceptions they are the best weapons available.


**Scout**: All stock; Bonk situationally

**Soldier**: Stock + Equalizer; Buff Banner when playing on a big server

**Pyro**: Backburner, Flaregun, Axtinguisher; Use shotgun when faced with enemy pyros

**Demo**: All stock; Ullapool Caber/other melee if like

**Heavy**: Minigun, Sandvich, GRU; Use other heavy primaries when necessary

**Engineer**: Depends on your style, but if you aren't using the Gunslinger you need to be using the Jag

**Medic**: Syringe Gun (you need the health), Medi Gun (**for the love of god don't use the fucking Quick-Fix**), Ubersaw; Kritz against big crowds (not against sentries...)

**Sniper**: Rifle + DDS/Jarate, if you're using Huntsman you probably shouldn't be playing Sniper

**Spy**: Stock, use Dead Ringer when necessary, avoid using Cloak and Dagger because it makes you a shitty spy

That's the short story when it comes to items. A lot of this is based on my preference, so if you find something that you think works better then use it by all means, but really do avoid using the Quick-Fix and the Cloak and Dagger.


***3) Do your job.***


Each class has a certain role that if they aren't fulfilling, they are not being credit to team.


**Scout**: Your job is to flank the enemy. This means attack them from the sides and from behind. You must utilize your greatest asset: speed. Do this by moving constantly and unpredictably. Your targets: medics, demos, anyone on their own.


**Soldier**: Your job is to deal a lot of damage, while still moving quickly. This might come as a surprise considering the soldier is the second slowest class, but by rocket jumping they can be very maneuverable. In order to do this though you must stay healed so make sure to protect your medic at all costs.


**Pyro**: Your job is to ambush enemies. Use corners to your advantage. Sneak up behind enemies, light them on fire, and axtinguish them. All it takes is one hit on an enemy on fire with the axtinguisher and most classes are dead. Spy check every person you see and sometimes just randomly in the air. Air blast (M2) ubers back.

**Demo**: Your job is to protect choke points and in general just kill. Demomen are one of the best classes for dealing damage and cannot be beat for defending. Locate high traffic areas on the map and place your stickies there. Hold down M1 with the sticky launcher to launch stickies further. When in doubt, spam pipes. You are the most effective at destroying a large number of sentries. Remember it only takes 3 stickies to destroy a sentry. Learn how to sticky jump.

**Heavy**: Your job is to tank and to deal the most damage. Heavies are great at attacking crowds, especially with a medic partner. Use the GRU to get to the front line. Use M2 to give your sandvich to your medic. Use M2 with your gun to spin up before turning corners to be ready to attack.

**Engineer**: If you are defending, your job is to use your sentry to protect areas. If you are on offense, your job is to teleport your teammates to the front line. I can't stress this enough: good teleports can win the game. Your dispenser is for your teammates, not just you; build it as close to the front line as possible. Don't be afraid to use your shotgun and pistol to deal extra damage to the enemy.

**Medic**: You are by far the most important class. Your job is to stay alive. Heal teammates and use your ubers to push forward. The worst thing you can do as a medic is die, even worse is to die with an uber. Use it, don't lose it. Do not just heal the heavy. Heal teammates with the lowest health first. Overheal your teammates every chance you get. Don't leave your back exposed.

**Sniper**: You are the least important, most situational class. Do not play this class unless your team is winning or you are very good at it. Aim for high valued targets like the medic and easy targets like the heavy. Just because you aren't dying doesn't mean you are doing well. Unless you are getting several headshots a minute, you should be playing another class.

**Spy**: This is by far the hardest class to play. My advice is similar for the sniper: don't play this class if your team is losing. Take out the enemy teleporters, kill the engies, and sap the buildings. Learn how to backstab the engie, then quickly sap his sentry. Remember that your watch makes a sound when you uncloak so try to uncloak a good distance away. This class is useless if the enemy team has several pyros or if your team has more than one other spy.

**All classes**: 


* **LOOK OUT FOR SPIES.** Seriously this is the easiest way to kill a noob. If you see someone act weird, spy check them. Spy check everyone you see anyway. Turn around every few seconds, even when you think you're alone. Be paranoid.

* Never stand still. If you've played TF2 for any amount of time, you've probably already learned this lesson. If you stand still, you will die. You will get sniped, backstabbed, shot, or blown up.


* Teleporters are extremely important. Help the engie by upgrading his teles before the round starts or whenever you can (it only takes a second to switch to engie, upgrade it, then switch back).


* Stand on the point. If you are defending, even if you think you will die, if the enemy is capturing, stand on the point. If you are attacking, even if you think you will die, if your team is pushing hard, stand on the point.

Look no further.,bamfusername,30,4,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/jeqwp/having_trouble_with_engineers_as_a_spy_look_no/,"Many new spies seem to face enormous difficulty when it comes to taking down a sentry. It's quite a challenge and it's very easy for the entire process to go wrong. *One errant twitch...*

The process of taking down an engineer and his nest can be divided into three stages

* The Approach
* The Attack
* The Escape

**The Approach**

Every spy knows just how difficult it is to get close to a sentry. Let's face it - engineers are a paranoid bunch and so are their team of dedicated spycheckers. And every single one is perfectly willing to show you just how much they love you with the business end of their weapons.

The approach is all about getting into the ideal position to strike and do to that, you have to avoid eliciting suspicion at all costs.

First of all, choose a disguise that makes sense. It's hard for anyone to quantify what exactly the best disguise is, but try to pick something that doesn't restrict mobility (this will be important later) and won't stand out. You want to keep a low profile. Personally, I tend to disguise as an engineer with a wrench out, since they're expected to be constantly wrenching their sentries. 

Second, work on your acting. Don't be the idiot who runs straight at the sentry while disguised as a spy. No. Don't be the guy who blindly rushes for the engineer.

Avoid looking directly at the sentry or engineer while you approach it. Keep your crosshair focused on your team. Remember, you're part of the enemy team now. You've got to look like you're scanning for threats.

Third, if at all possible, *avoid being seen at all*. I cannot emphasize this enough. If you think you'll be able to get in AND uncloak unseen, do it! Keep the element of surprise on your side.

**The attack**

When should you attack? The ideal time would be when the engineer is distracted by your team. Be patient - waiting a few seconds for your team to move against the engineer can completely alter the results of your attack.

Now, you should be in position to strike. But *how* does one go about doing this?

* Sap and Sap

Technique:
Constantly reapply sappers on ALL of the buildings near you. This is a battle of attrition which the engineer will lose if he doesn't try to kill you, because you can reapply sappers at a ridiculous rate and he can't outrepair the damage on all his buildings.

Advantages:

You can keep your disguise - losing your disguise is an instant giveaway. This gives you a few seconds of hesitation on the part of your enemies before they start to move in on you.

It's idiot-proof(ish) - no fancy tricks involved. Just press 2 and spam M1 until everything goes down. It's hard to screw this up.

Disadvantages:

The engineer stays alive. And he's going to be **angry**. A smart engineer will try and shotgun you before unsapping his stuff, which is dangerous for you - you're pretty dang fragile.

It's slow - it's a battle of attrition. Anyone who looks at you doing this will probably just start spamming at the sentry nest to kill you.

You can counteract this by juking and jumping on the engineers buildings to throw him off.

When to Sap and Sap: 

When you're faced with multiple, overlapping sentry guns - you won't be able to stab an engineer and get away with it. This is pretty much the only way to take down multiple sentries safely.

When your team is going to back you up. In this case, you just need to sap everything for a few seconds to let your team finish up.

* Stab and sap

Technique:

(You'll need fast weapon switch enabled)
Stab the engineer, switch to your sapper quickly and apply it *while strafing around the sentry*. If you stab the engineer while the sentry is turning to the left, you strafe *right*. This buys you precious time to apply the sapper.

Advantages:

The engineer dies. He won't be able to kill you or unsap his stuff.

It's fast. The entire move occurs in under a second.

Disadvantages:

Easy to screw up. You will not believe how easy it is to stab the sentry and sap the engineer. Also failstabs, misses, lag and plain bad luck. It's a fairly advanced move for a new player and takes practice to get used to.

You lose your disguise. You'll need to get away VERY quickly after sapping everything.

When to use:

This is a pretty effective move and can be applied on most engineers. However, skilled players aren't likely to give you the chance to stab them. You'll need more effort to pull it off against an alert engineer.

* Sap and Stab

Technique:

It's like stab and sap, but backwards. You sap the sentry, then go for the engineer.

Advantages:

Sapping first might make things easier - you don't need to worry as much about the sentry.

Disadvantages:

An alert engineer will probably just kill you before unsapping his sentry.

You lose the element of surprise.

When to use:

When the engineer is AWAY from his buildings. Sap his buildings, move slightly further away and have them act as bait. Most engineers will panic and run straight for their sentry, ignoring everything else. That's when you go in for the stab.

* Sap and shoot

Technique:

Sap the sentry, gun down the engineer

Advantages:

Depending on the situation, it might be safer to use your gun. Engineers love to wrench spies and as much as the dang thing crits, it's still bringing a wrench to a gun fight.

Disadvantages:

If you can't aim, you're screwed. -.-

When to use:

Wrench-lovin' engineers on the other team.

Alert jerk on the other team who won't turn expose his juicy back for a stab.

When the sentry and engineer are near, but not right next to each other.

* Abusing dispensers

Most people don't realize two things about dispensers

1. Your sentry can't shoot through your own dispenser

2. The dispenser hitbox is fricking enormous.

This means that the dispenser is a fantastic shield. You can stand behind the dispenser and unload your revolver on the engineer and the sentry without taking any damage.

Alternatively, if the engineer is standing in between his dispenser and his sentry, stand behind his dispenser and start shooting - his sentry will turn around and try to shoot you, but the engineer will be killed (You can be killed by your own sentry) and you'll be completely safe.

Advantages:

Less risky than sap and shoot

Disadvantages:

You'll be forced to stay in one spot, so if the engineer and sentry don't go down quickly, you'll die.

Situational - you won't always be able to take advantage of it. 

When to use:

When sap and shoot doesn't seem viable (engineer has good aim, for example)



* Abusing teleporters or: How I learned to telefrag like a boss.

Technique:

Sap the teleporter entrance and stand on it. Wait for the engineer to unsap it. If he's an idiot, he'll be standing on the exit and you'll teleport straight through, telefragging him and giving yourself a chance to sap his unprotected buildings.

Advantages:

You keep your disguise

You kill the engineer

Unexpected

Disadvantages:

Depends on the engineer being an idiot and standing on the teleporter exit to unsap.

Relatively well known spy trick - it's not as unexpected as you think.

When to use:

When you've successfully infiltrated the enemy base

When you're up against newish players



**The Escape**

Hopefully, you're now standing in the ruins of the once proud creations of an engineer. The engineer will be desperately crying and begging for his team to kill you.It's time for you, the dashing rogue, to make your great escape. And you don't have a motorbike to ride off into the sunset.

Honestly, this bit isn't too complicated. Cloak, disguise and run away, knowing that you've just crushed the hopes and dreams of yet another engineer.

Ok, so you've built up a little weapon stash, and now you want in on some of that fancy hat action. Well, here's a little guide to get you started.

Currency in the TF2 economy is mostly metal. Metal comes in three varieties: Scrap, Reclaimed, and Refined. 

**Scrap metal** is the lowest form of metal, and is made by **combining any two weapons used by the same class**. As a general rule when trading, **1 weapon = 1 scrap**. 

**Reclaimed Metal** is a medium form of metal. This is made by **combining three scrap metal**. Reclaimed metal is used to purchase some low-end stranges, but not much else. 

**Refined metal** is the highest form of metal, and is made by **combining three reclaimed metal**. This is used to buy higher-end strange weapons, and quite a few of the average hats. 

Prices are abbreviated as their value in refined metal. 1.11, for example, denotes 1 refined metal (1) and 1 scrap mental (.11), because a scrap metal is 11 percent of a refined metal. 

If we're going higher than that, we get into **keys.** Keys can only be acquired via purchase from the Mann Co. Store, but many people sell them on the ""grey market"" for cheaper, and even for metal. Once again, as a general rule, **1 key = ~3 ref**, give or take. Keys are used to purchase very high end hats and strange weapons, for example a Strange Kritzkrieg is anywhere from 37 to 39 keys, because it could only be found in an incredibly rare crate, and that crate is now discontinued. 

Going even *higher*, you've got **Bill's Hats**. Bill's Hat was a promotional item for pre-ordering Left 4 Dead 2, and there's only a limited number in circulation. Bills hats are worth around **8 keys**, more if painted certain colours, and are used in the purchase of low-end unusuals.

Now we're in unusual territory. The **Earbud** was a promotional item given to anybody who played TF2 on a mac within the first week or so of its release on that platform, and as a result are very rare. A pair of earbuds will run you around **25 keys**, but that's not what's important. When you get into high-level unusual trading, earbuds are the primary currency. 

Beyond that, we get into the really expensive promo territory, things like the Max's Severed Head (2 buds) and the Hat Of Undeniable Wealth And Respect(10 buds). 

So, what does all this have to do with you, my poor and Irish TF2 newbie? Well, everybody's got a favourite class, right? You probably want a hat for that class that's on fire. Everybody likes fire. Well, in order to get that, you need an Unusual. Unusual hats are hats with special effects, such as flies, orbiting planets, or the aforementioned fire. They can range from as cheap as a bill's hat for the crappy ones to as expensive as 15 buds for the really nice ones. Sometimes people buy and sell unusuals for real money, sometimes as much as $500. 

Unusuals come from crates, but that doesn't mean that crates are worthwhile to open. As a general rule, don't open crates. You'll almost always lose the money/metal you spent on the key. 

As far as tips and tricks go, general economics rules apply: Buy low, sell high. Buy things for as low a price as you can get away with, and sell them at as high a price as people will pay. Once you start to build up a collection of weapons you either already have or don't want, sell them off for a small profit in metal. 

The #1 rule of trading is to always, always check prices and see if you can get a better deal when buying. Never accept deals or prices based on what others tell you is good.

If you aim directly at an enemy, and he dodges your rocket, the rocket will usually sail right by him, doing zero damage.  If you aim at his feet, the rocket is guaranteed to explode, so even if you miss, you at least cause some splash damage.  As you get better, aiming at your enemy's feet has the added benefit of launching your opponent into the air, allowing you to 'juggle' them with well-aimed rockets.  This is one of the reasons why having the high ground is so important to Soldiers.


2. **An enemy is never just *running*.  He is always running *somewhere*.**  Towards the cart, towards his sentry nest, towards the stairs.  He might be dodging and strafing in the meantime, but he almost always has a final destination in mind.  Use this to predict his movement patterns and fire your rockets accordingly.  At short range, you are better off firing at him directly, but at long range, your rockets will be too slow if you don't lead your target.

I see beginning soldiers screw these up *constantly*.  I think this is because rocket launchers are no longer standard issue in most modern FPS's, so gamers newer to the FPS scene have never experienced the kind of rocket combat found in older FPS's like Quake and Unreal Tournament.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_iteoh,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/iteoh/two_very_simple_but_very_important_pointers_on/,

I played on Reddit Midwest a couple of nights ago and had a great time.  Having better players tell you 'nice shot' when you're playing sniper (and still trying to figure out how the sniper works best) is very motivating.  When running around as a heavy, having a healer who not only is good at it, but is willing to tell you when to back off or get out of danger really helps your game.  

And I must say, standing next to a dispenser as a heavy defending a CP is ridiculous fun.  I don't think I let off the trigger for 2 minutes straight till the game crashed.  I guess that's valve's way of telling you to let the barrels cool down.

- If somebody else is already on the telporter pad, then don't push them off. This is strictly douchebag behavior.
- If you are on the pad waiting for a recharge and you see a Heavy or a Soldier run up, then strongly consider running back so they can take it instead. The goal is to get the entire team back in the fight ASAP; the slower runspeed classes benefit much more than you do.
- When you play Scout, don't take a teleporter unless you are the only person in your respawn group.
- When you decide to pass on the teleporter, use the opportunity to sweep the area between the respawn and the front line for spies. Shoot every person you see who is on ""your team"". Smart spies will often get behind the front line specifically to sap the teleporters at spawn; sweeping is a good habit that helps keep those crucial teleporters up and running.
- When you play Engineer, upgrade every single teleport pad you see to level three before returning to the front line. If your teleport was destroyed when you died, build your entry to level three before returning. You have essentially unlimited free metal at spawn and it only takes two short trips to upgrade a pad all the way from level one to level three.
- Nearly every team has 1-3 players who are clearly better than the rest of the group. The more time these people spend on the front line, the better chance your side has of winning. If you are not one of these people, then don't let your ego get in the way; let the all-stars go back first when they are in your respawn group.

I can't really speculate as to whether this is a new player problem or a general problem, but I figured I would post this here anyway.

Today I was playing medic and I noticed that a lot of my patients had what I was calling to myself ""tunnel vision""  How can they miss these things going on around them, I thought to myself.  Then it occurred to me, maybe they REALLY DO have tunnel vision.   

By changing your field of view you can see more of the battlefield at once.  The default Field of view is 75, which means that your monitor is showing a 75 degree field of view in front of your character.  In multiplayer -&gt; advanced there is a slider that allows you to up this to 90. 

Furthermore, you can change your model field of view with a console command.  The default model fov is 54, and doesn't give you a larger field of view of the battlefield, but gives you a wider view of your character model, the result being that your weapon takes up less of the screen (the exception being the heavy).  I prefer 75, the command is:
viewmodel_fov 75 

Remember, knowing what is happening around you makes a huge difference, and once you've over come the physical limitations of the default settings, you should also practice becoming more aware of your surroundings in the game all the time using queues like sounds, paying attention to the killboard, etc.

So what can you win? One of each of ***Last Years*** costume sets. They are uncraftable however, so they may not have much actual value, other than someone being a good home to them.

So if you just got into TF2 in the last year and want a FREE Halloween costume, post here with your steam profile link and let me know which class you are entering for (you may choose 2 but can only win 1) and then wait until tomorrow.

As an example, I can normally cover the distance in Bad Water Basin from Red to Blu spawn in the same time using this vs. wearing GRU constantly, the only difference that I can arrive at about 286-280 health.

For me this is especially helpful when medics aren't around, or even when they are around healing you, using this helps in getting you to full buff faster.

Of course, this isn't always the best idea as it might kill you, but hey, sometimes it's worth to die if you can destroy a sentry that keeps your team giving that final push to the Payload.

* **Noteworthy CFG Makers/Scripters**.  Have you taken the time to check out the [guide to customizing your controls?](http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/k1p7z/this_fits_me_like_a_hat_a_guide_to_customizing/)  If you think you've gotten a hang on it, try submitting some of your configurations for people to use.

I'm fairly damn good at most FPS's I've played.  I've put about 300 hours into this game, but the only class that I can say I am decent enough to be credit to team is the sniper.  I usually just play him since I can generally shut down an entire area of the map.

Engineer is easy enough.  IMO, he comes down to more knowing the maps and where to put your sentry/teleporters to benefit the team the most.

Spy?  Yea, I've gotten one kill as a spy and that was a cross map handgun shot.

Heavy is alright.  Usually I get a pocket medic and I just try and get close and personal.  I do alright with heavies.

Demoman?  I completely suck at.  The only good I do as a Demoman is put my sticky bombs near the cart/entrance, go and hide, then blow them when somebody gets near them.  The other gun I'll try and shoot the bouncing bombs where I know players are, but I rarely ever hit anything.

Soldier?  I've gotten somewhat decent at bouncing my opponents, but it seems that most of the time I am blindly shooting where I think opponents might be.

Medic I'm alright at.  Easy enough. Stay hidden while healing Heavy/Soldier/Demo.  I usually find the highest rated player on my team and pocket heal him.  

Pyro?  I'm dead before I even start firing.

Scout?  Surprisingly I am alright at Scout.  

---------
So a few questions... 

1.  When I am demoman/soldier, I take IMMENSE damage trying to launch myself.  Usually I die when I land.  I have those boots that reduce damage for my soldier, but I see players doing full map launches without taking a single point of damage. What's that about?

2.  Is the point of the demoman/soldier to just shoot where you think players are going to be?  I think there is a soldier gun that shoots much faster rockets, is that what all these players are using?

3.  What are these practice servers I hear everybody going on about?  Where you can practice your rocket jumps or bouncing opponents, etc?

4.  I'd love a wrangler.  I posted awhile ago on the [TF2Trade](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/gsout/w_wrangler_new_to_trading/) subreddit, but the guy never came through with it.  Anybody want to trade?

___________________________________

A lot of people would say that the Spy's biggest counter is the Pyro. That is only true up to a certain point. The truth is the biggest counter to the Spy is **Paranoia**.

Why? Because the Spy's biggest weapon is stealth. Any class that is paranoid enough can counter the Spy just as well as the Pyro can.

But then the reverse is also true. Any Spy that is stealthy enough can counter any Pyro, or any other class for that matter.

Knowing that, the bigger picture emerges. What seperates the good spies from the bad spies is how the good spies manage and manipulate paranoia to their own advantage. Let's go into more detail.

Paranoia is simply when other players are afraid of getting backstabbed by you. What drives paranoia is a mixture of both survival instinct and childish fear. Symptoms of paranoia include the following:

     *Shouting ""Spy!"" in voice commands  
     *Spychecking teammates excessively 
     *Turning around, looking at ledges and corners 
     *Walking in zigzags trying to bump into a spy 
     *Randomly firing or swinging at the air 
     *Firing at friendly dispensers 
     *Walking backwards to see if anyone's following 
     *More pyros than there were before.

This list starts from the least worst going down to the worst forms of paranoia. Just as the Spy's main weapons are Cloak, Knife, Revolver, Ability to see enemy health and Evasion, the above list is the many weapons that players will use against you, whether they know it or not, to fight your stealth. Know them well and be familiar with them.



No matter what game mode you are in, as long as you are a spy, there will be paranoia amongst the players. The more spies, the more paranoia there will be, which will then increase the symptoms of paranoia, not just in number, but in harshness. That is why one of the important decisions of picking the Spy class in a game is whether or not you want to do your spying in an extremely paranoid environment. 

_____________________________________________________

&gt;Every class has a counter, but can you counter Paranoia?

As stated, the biggest counter to the Spy is paranoia because the biggest weapon of the spy is stealth. So how do you counter Paranoia?

Other teammates. Your team mates effectively counter paranoia. (There is one exception to this, the Scout - more about him soon) because after all, who has time to worry about what's behind them when they're being shot in the face? Your team mates firing at your enemy reduce paranoia by re-directing their stress sources to the situation in front of them. This is where you take advantage and strike.

Too many spies die trying to stab heavy-medic combos because they make the mistake of trying to stab them while they aren't shooting anyone, while they're moving towards their target for instance.
Another popular one is a sentry that just will not go down because the engineer is on the lookout for you constantly.

The mistake with these two scenarios is that the Spy has been effectively countered by the enemy paranoia. To counter the paranoia, stab them when they least expect it. Stab the medic when the heavy is busy shooting and let the heavy die on his own. Stab the engineer when he's hitting his sentry with his wrench when it's under attack. Use your team mate's fire to your advantage. 

Beware of friendly scouts. They are your 2nd worst enemies after paranoid Pyros. You're probably thinking it's weird that a team mate can be an enemy. But guess what?

Friendly scouts attract an insane amount of attention. They also can cover a lot of space in a short space of time, and to top it all off, they will often use side routes that the Spy uses in order to get to their objective quicker. Scouts are a big threat to any team because of how directly they can achieve the team objective better than anyone else.

Combine this altogether and what you get is a big, fat, paranoia magnet. If you are near a friendly scout in enemy territory, you can bet on your death in the next 10 seconds. Stay away from friendly scouts as if they were enemy Pyros. 

_____________________________________

We established paranoia was an element of fear. The fear element exists because people are afraid of what they can't see. So, one of the elements of countering paranoia is to create something for them to see. In other words, make them see or think the way you want.

Let's have a few examples:
*On CTF maps, i would disguise as a friendly scout then purposefully let the enemy see me. Then i would cloak instantly as the enemy came rushing to find out where the ""scout"" had gone. I escaped into their base and camped a dispenser while i went to the bathroom and got a drink. 

*I would disguise as a friendly soldier or demoman before approaching a sentry. If you've played engineer, you know that these two classes are a nightmare. I would let the engineer see me - he then grew tense and waited anxiously by his sentry to repair it ""just in case"" while i stuck a knife into his back a few seconds later and a juicy sapper on his level 3 sentry.  

The idea is simply this, make them see something that they haven't, and while they briefly focus at the bait that you've just thrown them, stab them or use that as your opportunity to sink further into the base.  Focus the paranoia on a particular fixed area - then use your cloak to slip by the area of paranoia you've just created. 
_______________________________________

Sometimes the best way to counter paranoia is to avoid it and create it somewhere else. All enemies have a ""zone"" of paranoia which they project. Paranoid engineers will be paranoid anywhere around their sentry. Paranoid pyro's will often have their zone as the entry to their base, or side entrances like vents or tunnels.

The point i'm making is that paranoia is restricted to a space. If people are looking for you in that space, chances are they will find you. If you keep operating as a Spy in the same space, doing the same things (i.e, stabbing snipers at the back of the map) then that space will become ""hot"" in the sense that people will constantly be looking for you there.

Have any of you played the Metal Gear Solid series? Well if you haven't, the minute you're spotted by the enemy, they go on Alert status. They chase you until you disappear somewhere. Then they go on Caution status. Then eventually calm down as long as you keep perfectly still and silent in your hiding place. The Spy is no different. If you wait long enough with nothing happening, people will stop caring. That is when you attack again.

Occasionally you will find that you've created so much chaos that people will actively run around and look for you. If this happens, switch your ""zone"" somewhere else. Go stab someone else instead of always attacking the sentry or the medic/heavy. Have some shooting practice. Or instead of attacking the enemy team's defences, attack their offences instead. The Spy can help the team in very diverse ways, just be creative. 

_________________________________________

If you want to make your time with the Spy the most enjoyable, you have to understand that he is not an offensive class. He is a support class, just like the medic. Which means that your job is to slip underneath the enemy, support your team indirectly then attack at the right place at the right time. It's no different to Ubercharge. An Ubercharge only succeeds if it's used on the right person, at the right time, in the right situation. This is why i insist that the Spy is a support class and not an offensive class because his style is very similar to the medic.

People who play the Spy offensively i.e, ""suicide spies"" will often find themselves getting mowed down a lot quicker as time goes by. Eventually, they will change class. After all, if you backstab people, they'll just respawn. If you keep backstabbing them, they'll learn to expect you. Some will turn Pyro just to burn you.

TF2 is an objective orientated team-based game, which means endlessly stabbing people isn't doing your team a favour. Because guess what, if people get backstabbed, they'll just respawn and try again (especially if they're on BLU). Unless you backstab for a good reason in a good place, then you aren't doing your team any favours. In Arena, if you always run in for a backstab, the opponents will learn to expect you and create paranoia that kills you quicker.

Conclusion:
Paranoia is the biggest weapon versus spies, not the Pyro. It is decreased when your teammates arrive and start attacking. It can be shaped and focused in another part of the map to reduce the chance of you dying. If you slow down your activity, less people will be hunting you. 
The Spy is a support class, and must be played like one to prevent repeated deaths as paranoia rises.

If you've ever played a King of the Hill match, chances are you've seen one of [these little buggers](
http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/b/b9/Engineer_Update_MiniSentries.png/800px-Engineer_Update_MiniSentries.png)

The Combat Mini Sentry Gun (commonly known as a mini sentry) is a special sentry gun that replaces the Engineer's standard Sentry when wielding the Gunslinger instead of a wrench. It cannot be upgraded or repaired, and deals only half the damage of a level 1 sentry. However, it constructs in 3 seconds, fires twice as fast as a level 1 sentry, and costs only 100 metal. In addition, the engineer that placed it has an extra 25 health. 

The mini-sentry is particularly effective in King of The Hill because it is a reliable source of quick damage that doesn't require the commitment of a regular sentry. Engineers often take advantage of a KotH map's smaller size, and open control point and deploy mini sentries while peppering enemies with their pistol. This is made even more effective with the Frontier Justice which gains revenge crits for kills after the mini sentry is destroyed.

This of course, leads to a very bad day for anyone not prepared to deal with it. Mini sentries are often shunned on KotH maps and servers because they are labeled ""cheap"" and ""broken"" 

While this may or may not be true, have some tips on how to overcome the dreaded little gun before you ragequit: 

* Avoid the sentry. This is blatantly obvious, but people forget about the thing and just go chasing enemies as it whittles them down. just stay out of its range and go raise hell somewhere else. 
* Heckle the engineer. If you see the engie, go after him. And do it again. And again. And again. And again. If you stay persistent, and live, you'll outlast him and he'll switch to another class just to stop you from killing him so much. 
* Go Medic. Mini sentry? I'm sorry, I can't hear them over my heavy that's ripping your team apart! Those little bullets are like pin pricks on a cowhide! 
*  Speaking of, Pyros, heavies, demomen, and soldiers are already effective at taking out engineer buildings, it's just a smaller, more fragile target with the mini sentry. be careful though because you'll likely be taking fire from the gun, the engie, and 3 other classes in that cramped KotH map while you do it. 
* Scouts and spies beware, you are the mini sentry's most vulnerable prey. Try to get a few meatshots on the engie while he's carrying the gun, and get up close and blast the little thing while it's building if you're faced with the situation. Spies take advantage of the engineer's focus on the sentry to sneak in a backstab; and your revolver is a great tool for taking them out at a distance. (scouts are actually effective in KotH maps too, so the mini sentry kind of puts them in their place with a side effect of shooting everone else :p) 
* If all else fails, play the mini sentry game. Use your own gunslinger and beat him at his own game. Drop down your sentries faster and in better spots. Punish him for ever thinking he could best you in the ring of Less Gun!

Be warned, I cuss quite a lot, there's something inherently satisfying about swearing with a Scottish accent. Anyway this is a groundwork of tips for playing Medic for anyone who's interested.(and yes, I've edited it slightly for reddit) - Normal?

- If you're being healed by a medic and he stops healing you, TURN  AROUND. Chances are a spy got him, or he's had to pull out his ubersaw to fend one off, which will be much easier if you're their to help. I can't repeat that enough.

-If approaching a medic looking for a heal, Fire your weapon. That assures the medic that you aren't a spy, and saves valuable seconds, getting you back to the fight quicker (YER spys, switch to your sapper from current weapon, as the disguised spy cannot do this)

- Don't use the blutz. It cuts your health down to +1/sec rather than +3. Yes, it does hph when attacking, but that's quite useless since you are almost never alone (and if you are alone, 90% of the time your ally just died, meaning there is a few enemies, and they are all gunning for you). Overdose is ok, the speed boost is nice, crossbow is fine provided you have the amputator for the +4 boost. Personally I like the overdose. That +speed boost when I'm at 90% uber and have to retreat is a godsend. Either use that or the stock needlegun. You aren't here to kill anything more than the odd scout/pyro/spy that sneaks up on you, and even them, you should be with your team who can do it much faster. (Unless they're a bunch of idiots, in which case you'll probably rage quit and go demopan or spycrab)

-If you pop an uber to engage a sentry nest, run infront of whoever you're ubering to draw it's fire, this way the ubered ally can aim straight and take the nest down quicker. This can also be done if you're popping an uber to wipe enemies, though be wary of airblasting pyros. If in doubt, retreat.

-If you are under heavy fire, and think you'll die, pop your uber. A premature uber that gets 2 kills is better than a dead medic with 0 kills. you can get the sentry with the next uber.

-If the medic pops uber on you to take down a nest, destroy the sentry and engi but try to leave the dispenser up and clear out foes. The medic can use his ubersaw on this to buff up his ubercharge, allowing you to steamroll the next point. [UNCONFIRMED]

-If playing medic, heal EVERYONE. I mean everyone. That sniper, that spy, the god damn engi. yes, some classes take priority, but if you have a free second, make sure everyone is topped up. If you're under fire, pocket the right player for the location until you can get to health, then heal up the team.

-Only run the quick fix if there is at least one other good medic. If I'm being honest, I'd rather you only run it if there is 2 other medics, but that's my preference.

-it's ok to retreat and let whoever you're healing die. If a pyro decides to charge a sentry nest at medium range while you have 20% uber, leave that fucker. The MEDIC is the most valuable member of the team, and an uber takes longer to build than it does for a M1 to respawn. Let the moron die and regroup with your team.

-If you're getting healed with a medic, pay attention to the chat log, I always post ""Go go go!"" when I'm wanting to spark an uber on an ally.

-Don't ask medics to pocket you. We are here to support the entire team, not your personal killing spree. I will heal whoever takes greatest priority, generally (Intel Carrier&gt;Medics&gt;Demos&gt;sollys&gt;heavys&gt;pyros&gt;scouts&gt;anyone else) as my healing of these classes will produce the best push/most kills - [of course this is entirely situational]

- heal those at lower health before those at higher. That should be obvious.

-if you see another medic about to go down, for the love of god switch from the overhealed heavy to top him up. He's building an uber, see to it that he doesn't lose it, it'll mean a quicker victory for your team.

-If you are going to a medipack and see a medic, and they have lost health, LET THEM take the medipack. Jackass. The number of times I've died from overburn because some random teammate run infront, or through me to the pack (scouts I'm looking at you) is ridiculous. My class has a giant heal gun. Let me use it.

-Move move move move move. Always crouch jump, always stay behind whoever you're healing. Use walls as cover in case of snipahs. Stay the fuck away from walls in case of demos. You get the jist, dive duck dodge and weave, if you can dodge a wrench you can dodge gruesome death.

-Medic is target #1 for all classes. Remember this, you're going to be taking a lot of flack, so learn where the healthpacks are on missions, and above all stay with your team. If a pyro's going behind an enemy to backburner, that's their choice, but unless you have a full uber that can steamroll them, stick with your team, you're more use alive.

-If you're about to uber a soldier, wait till he finishes reloading. Soldiers have 4/3 rockets, and a perfectly timed Uber can destroy an enemy position, but they have a long ass reload time. Same goes for pipe launcher demos, although really they should be using stickies to wipe a sentry nest.

-Always let the medic get on the teleporter before you, don't ever try push them off. You can run in and die. The medic can heal up two teamates who would've died, build an uber, slap it on you and push to victory.

-Watch where the Ubered medic is coming from, if he didn't uber you and he's running back, chances are his ally got airblasted away and killed. If you charge in with this remaining uber, be wary of your surroundings, as it's running out. -heavies, if a retreating medic is seperated from his ubered ally, switch to your GRU and get forward to use up the last bit of uber with your minigun, rather than pondorusly moving about with the brass beast. May as well get some kills in, but don't try to take on a nest, the uber will end, and you will die.-

-If suspicious of an ally running towards you, shoot them, that should be basic knowledge. You have a high critz rate on the ubersaw, but be careful, sidestabs can occur.

-totally ignore K/D. You're a medic. This should be obvious. Oh, and if you follow the above advice, scoring mvp isn't hard.

- Know when to use your uber/kritz. Against one enemy? nope.jpeg. Against a sentry nest and a couple of guards? Uber that shit up!

Remember, above all else, Ubercharge/kritz is absolutely critical to TF2 gameplay, and you are a team player. Stick with your allies, buff them up, save them, dominate the leaderboard, and then come to me, I'll give you a little medal.

1311061013.0,23,self.NewToTF2,itmnx,Why the Backburner isn't worth your time.,HereticalSteampunk,30,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/itmnx/why_the_backburner_isnt_worth_your_time/,"I was witness to a mass trading orgy of 3+ new players trying to find backburners earlier today. While I had a desire to explain to them why it isn't the best thing since sliced bread, I didn't feel like constructing a cohesive argument in the middle of a game. However, something the average new player should be entitled to learn is the simple fact that backburners are only going to hurt you in the long run.

Proponents of the backburner will cite it's increased damage and guaranteed rear critical as the reason to use it. Indeed, it does 10% additional damage from any angle and deals critical hits from the rear (+300% more damage). However, it suffers from a much more expensive airblast.

This brings us to my first point. Airblasting allows a pyro to be credit to team. Not only can you protect sentry nests and defend yourself at range, you're able to extinguish flaming team mates (which will net you 1 point per person extinguished, points equal to that of a kill!) The Flamethrower and Degreaser each have the potential for 10 airblasts at 20 ammo each, the Backburner can perform 4 at 50 ammo each. That's a great deal of utility lost. Pyro v. Soldier becomes a game of 'run away' and no longer can you embarrass snipers by covering them in their own piss without depleting a quarter of your own ammo.

Now that we've covered the downside, let's address the damage issue. An additional 10% damage is indeed nice. It's a difference of 139.5 damage per second with the degreaser/standard to 160.4 damage per second with the BB (assuming point blank range with all particles hitting the target). This damage does not, however, apply to afterburn, which means you gain very little if you're running in and out, forcing the team to run back to medics/medpacks and playing good D (certainly not enough to justify the loss of 8 airblasts imo). It's nice in pyro v. pyro, but only if you can ensure that your opposition isn't 10% more accurate than you are.

Now let's talk about the rear critical. Back when it was first released you could crit a target as long as you started shooting while he was facing away, even if he turned, you'd still crit. This, in addition to +50 health made the weapon OP as Kalashnikovs in the Civil War. That's changed. Now one only crits within a roughly 90 degree angle at the targets back (unlike the 180 degree backstab hemisphere.) This encourages ambushing/flanking, as backburner crits will finish off any class in seconds. That sounds great until you remind yourself you're sacrificing survivability and team support to achieve it. Furthermore, the degreaser can also pull this off equally well in the form of the sting pyro.

The Degreaser allows you to switch weapons 65% faster (which is nearly instant in-game) at the cost of -25% afterburn damage (4 dmg per tick, rather than 6). This means you're utilizing the flare gun and axtingisher in new and exciting ways. To first counter the appeal of instant-crits from the degreaser, let's calculate how much damage a sting pyro can do in two seconds. Assuming 75% of our particles hit with the flamethrower, one second of damage will net about 105 damage. Add in a second of burn, 4 damage, and a quickswitch axtinguisher hit, 195 damage nets 304 damage, enough to one-shot a heavy.

To be fair, the backburner could have also done that with a rear-crit in a single second. But, the Degreaser/Axe did it from any angle, and can still puff out 9 more airblasts to assist in the pyro's escape without going to get ammo.

In addition to the excellent combo with the axtinguisher, the degreaser pairs well with the flair gun as it allows for flare spam and quick-swaps to the flame thrower for rocket reflects and surprise close combat. Also keep in mind that the flare gun crits burning targets at 90 damage, paired with afterburn, that's enough to one-shot a medic (forcing him to retreat to a health pack, slowing the enemy advance)

After all is considered, the backburner encourages a very passive pyro role that is more suitable to a sneaky Frenchman than a crazed pyromaniac. The airblast is a tool that all new players should learn how to use and the synergy between the pyro's weaponry is far too great to leave underutilized.

*(as a side note, if a fellow redditor would play devil's advocate for the backburner, I feel it would bring much needed balance to this post)*

tl;dr: Learn how to airblast and be a credit to team. Learn how to use your other two weapons and be a god.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_itmnx,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/itmnx/why_the_backburner_isnt_worth_your_time/,

How can I avoid this title?",Epicwarren,24,1,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ijmcj/a_teammate_ragequit_on_me_today_for_being_a/,"I was playing payroll race today, and I am currently working on medic. My team had two heavies (10 players total), and they seemed rather experienced, so I focused my healer attention on them. I thought I was doing very well: the two heavies had the top scores on the team, and  I had the 3rd top, and we were winning 3-0. Then a soldier on the team started yelling at me for being a useless heavy pocket medic, and disconnected.

I assume that ""pocket medic"" refers to the focusing of healing on only one or two players instead of the whole team. The reason I chose to focus on my heavies was because they were racking up kills, clearing both payload cards easy, and basically enabling the cart to move with ease. I want to focus on my whole team, but if I decide to stop healing a heavy in the middle of a battle because my soldier is low health, won't my heavy be at risk of dying? I consider a heavy more valuable than a soldier in an open-area battle. Or if heavy does survive but take a lot of damage, and soldier thinks he's going to die, they will both run for cover thinking I won't heal them and the enemy can advance while I derp in the middle of the field.

I just fear that if I keep switching healer targets, I will end up killing teammates who think I have their back and run into the battle. Any thoughts on this?",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_ijmcj,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ijmcj/a_teammate_ragequit_on_me_today_for_being_a/,

After over 1,000 hours played, and maining every class at one point or another, I fell in love with backburner pyro. Here are some things I've learned about the class that should apply to most kits, but I personally run: Backburner, shotgun, axetinguisher. 

1. Flare gun. I'm not going to make this thread a bash on the flare gun, but understand if you use it, any half decent pyro will make you his bitch. He'll dance just out of your flamethrower range and shotgun you down. Inversely, If you see another pyro has a flare gun, MAKE HIM YOUR BITCH.

2. Use your axetinguisher on scouts. Blast them against something, step up - This next part is important - the scout will often have time to take a few steps. Their movement is ALWAYS predictable at this point, so just swing where they're going to go. You'll get the hang of it. Don't give up early.
 
3. One thing I NEVER see pyros do that drives me crazy is reflecting sentry rockets. First of all, if you're not letting the rockets hit you, it turns their p3 sentry into a p2 sentry. Secondly, you have a VERY good chance of one shotting someone if you hit them with the reflection. Those rockets hit hard as hell, and even harder when reflected. The timing is very easy to develop, just remember it and keep at it!

4. You can have a record for headshots as pyro! Huntsman arrows. Yeah.

5. Extinguish your fucking teammates &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; . It gets you a free point every time.

6. If you're playing backburner, don't reflect a rocket just because you can - If you don't have a good shot at reflecting it back at your opponent for some damage, just dodge and wait for him to fire the next one.

7. This applies to all classes, but since part of your class role is melting the spies, if you kill a spy and his weapon gives you no ammo, it was a fake kill.

8. If you can't kill him ( or at least get the crit 90) dont hit a heavy being pocketed with a flare. It will just build the docs uber quicker.

* You always have top priority for teleporters. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

* Do not build your 'nest' so you stand on the teleporter. A Spy will head to spawn, take your teleporter, [telefrag](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Telefrag) you and then proceed to [sap](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Sap) everything else.

* **MOUSE2 WILL ROTATE THE TELEPORTER EXIT**, as well as other buildings. Do **NOT** have exits facing walls, it's very disorienting, not to mention dangerous.

* Know if your [spawn](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Respawn_area) moves up. If so, move your teleporter entrance up accordingly. It's okay to wait a bit to be sure your team can hold the point.


[**DISPENSERS**](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Dispenser)

* A Level 3 dispenser heals at the same rate as a Medic.

* Dispensers, costing 100 [metal](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Metal), are the cheapest building available.

* Dispensers near the front lines are invaluable to teammates, as the infinite resupply of [ammo](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Ammo) and [health](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Health) can more than double their expected lifetime. Of course, being closer to the front lines puts it in danger.

[**SENTRIES**](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Sentry)

* Sentries can turn 360 degrees. Don't feel compelled to put them in corners; this makes it easier for splash damage weapons to hit them.

* Lower level sentries are quieter than higher ones.

* **DO NOT PUT SENTRIES NEXT TO EACHOTHER**. This provides little to no benefit and makes it all the more easier for a Spy or ubered Demoman to come in and destroy them in one fell detonation.

* Sentries provide a slightly higher boost than dispensers.

**DEALING WITH PRACTICAL PROBLEMS**

*Q: In what order should I place my equipment?*

A: It depends on 3 major factors: Numbers, Metal, and Aggressiveness.

If you're on a team of 12 with nearby metal and you're near the front lines, put down a Sentry, get it to level 2, put down the teleporter, get it to level 2, put down the dispenser and finish upgrading everything. Alternatively, put the sentry down last if you can convince your team guard you as you set up.

In general, the more nearby metal you have, the less you need a dispenser. The larger your team is, the less you need a sentry and the more you need a dispenser. The closer you get to the front lines, the more necessary a sentry becomes, and a teleporter.

*Q: I want to go engineer, but another Engineer already has the defense pinned down pretty well. What should I do?*

A: If you're an offensive engineer, you have two options: Push the front lines, or go 'Ninja-Engie'. Pushing the front lines entails setting up sentries to guard areas that are currently being hotly contested, which, if done successfully, will allow your team to move up. Becoming a 'Ninja-Engie' is essentially sneaking sentries and teleporters in places where the enemy rarely expects them. Choosing to do either often results in many rebuildings, although as a 'Ninja-Engie', you leave sentries and forget about them. Keeping the sentries at level 1, while shortening their life, will make them much harder to notice. When your sentry/teleporter is destroyed, DO NOT PUT IT IN THE SAME PLACE. The enemy will be expecting this. The entire point of going 'Ninja-Engie' is to surprise them.

*Q: It's the beginning of the round, there are some other engineers on the team, what should I do?*

A: **HELP THEM OUT**. One level 3 sentry does 225 damage per second. A level 1 does 64. A level 3 does **3.5 TIMES** the damage per second a level 1 sentry does. Therefore, one level 3 is better than two level 1s.

*Q: In general, where should I place my buildings in relation to eachother?""

A: You want to make sure that your other buildings cannot be attacked without them being in range of the sentry. Past that, it's up to you. Be sure that the teleporter exit isn't disorienting; I cannot tell you how many times i will find myself running back to our first point because of a confusing teleporter.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_as387,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/as387/in_celebration_of_50_hours_as_engie_heres_some/,

Basically, there are these huge ramps all throughout the map that you can slide down really fast. It makes for very exciting gameplay, as all the players are zipping and zooming past each other. Then there are several platforms or battle areas where players can combat with each other. Just don't fall off the edge!

Overall, surf maps are just more fun and a lot faster and more chaotic than normal maps. Come try it out!

In this thread, I will mostly be discussing the Doppler effect in relation to the pyros flamethrower. First, we need to understand who the Doppler effect works to ""compress"" or ""expand"" waves. Look at [THIS](http://www.physicsclassroom.com/class/waves/u10l3d3.gif) diagram to see an example.

Sound propagates in waves. Similarly, the pyros flamethrower does too. You can't see it but the flame you shoot is actually lots of small fireballs with limited range coming out at a constant rate. The instant a fireball leaves the flamethrower it will go a very exact distance and disappear. The position it moves to does not change even if the pyro is moving (otherwise the flamethrower would act more like a solid beam)

The effect of this is quite simple. If you are running BACKWARDS as a pyro, the furthest out active fireball is further away (by around 20% or so) from the pyros current position than a pyro standing still.

If you are running FORWARD, your flame will be shortened a significant amount relative to a standing pyro.

**So what does this mean for you, the pyro player?** Well, this tip helps the most with Pyro vs. Pyro combat. If ever you get into a flamethrower range with another pyro, make sure you are backpedaling. This will make your flame longer and his flame shorter. Once you have practiced pyro a lot, you will get to the point where you can consistently burn an enemy pyro while his flame either doesn't touch you or is barely licking you. Based on how many particles a flame has moved, the damage changes. Even if they ARE hitting you, your particles will have flown a short distance and will be doing more damage.

**Pyro vs Pyro Technique #2**
*Circle Strafing*
If you are at a health disadvantage to an enemy pyro then once you start back pedaling you should quickly strafe right or left while turning your aim the opposite direction. Due to how particles work, you should continue to lash him with the tip of your flame while the enemy pyro would have to correct his stream around 100-110 degrees to keep up with you in damage. Even for someone like me who has around 600 hours on pyro, (not that I would be chasing a pyro) I wouldn't try for this correction. I would just jump away.

A properly executed circle strafe involves a little bit of forward running too, just to exit their stream. I have defeated several pyros flamethrower only at as much as a 120 health deficit. It might sound hard but next time you are back pedaling from a pyro, circling around him while keeping your aim ahead of him a bit should feel pretty natural. I never exactly REALIZED what I was doing when I did this to pyros, it is just very natural.

**Pyro vs Pyro Technique #3**
*shotgun keepaway*
This is pretty self explanatory. The ideal set up here is the Degreaser and Shotgun. Basically, you are going to pelt them with your shotgun (if you aren't getting enough damage to kill them in 6 shells, let them close the gap a bit) and if they start to get you with their flamethrower, you quick switch, puff them away, and continue with your shotgun. This is likely the easiest and safest method for defeating an enemy pyro but it is BY FAR the slowest (unless you land 2 really meaty shots). If you run out of shells but have dealt significant damage then go ahead and burn him out. 

**GENERAL TIPS AND TRICKS**

* If you want to train to be an amazing mid range pyro, work as hard as you can to earn the ""Combined Fire"" achievement. Burning an opponent, then knocking them away from you and meatshotting them for 70-100 damage out of the air is one of the fastest and safest techniques for killing opponents. You will get a feel for how long it takes to do the damage you want to do before your shotgun can kill them. This technique allows you to be at an unsafe close range only momentarily.

* the Q key on your keyboard will always switch to your last active gun. If you like to axtinguish people, make sure you press 1 3 1 when you spawn and if your free time between fights to set your axe on Q.

* The flare gun reloads itself even if you don't have it out. Get into the habit of immediately putting away your flare gun when you shoot it. Having your flamethrower at the ready could safe you from a soldier rocket or any number of things.

* The flares will automatically crit a burning target for 90 damage at any range. Once you are a boss with the flare gun, try lighting someone up, launching then with an air puff and flaring them out of the air. This makes people MAD. MAD MAD MAD. Especially if you really ham it up and bounce them a couple of times before finishing them just to rub it in.

* The backburner does more base damage than the other flamethrowers. Its air blast costs more and seems bugged right now. It reflects projectiles just fine but sometimes when enemies are on slopes it will just simply not move them. I am not the only person that has noticed either.

**Recommended Loadouts**

* *All around powerful*

Degreaser

Shotgun

Axtinguisher

Gives you access to the fast kills of the axtinguisher, the safety of the shotgun and lightning fast switching (something that is more valuable on pyro than any other class) The shotgun will actually get you most of your kills on this setup with the flamethrower being used for AOE, airblasting, setting up axe combos and disabling fast targets with airblast for easy shotgunning.

*  *Flamethrower as primary weapon*

Backburner

Flaregun

Rake

You don't need the axtinguisher as much here so might as well carry the rake so you can roam alone. You will ambush people with this class. When you aren't sneaking around, you harass with the flaregun. The rake WILL cause serious harm if you choose to use it. You can still axe combo with it on low health classes due to its high base damage. Detonator sucks but is acceptable on this class.

* *Just don't*

Standard Flamethrower

Detonator

Volcanic Shard

Standard flamethrower is almost entirely inferior to the degreaser. It does 50 afterburn damage instead of 38. THAT'S. IT. Detonator is gimped as hell. Can't auto crit, making it pop accurately is too hard (and I have been playing with the thing in the beta realm for some time now). It is even harder if you have ping above about 50. The Volcanic shard is a low damage axe that ignite targets. Flamethrower out damage is several times over and it doesn't provide burst damage like the other axes.

Basic options- I look for servers with ping &lt; 100, VAC secure, not full, no password, and a limit of 24 players per server. Feel free to adjust the player limit to your personal taste.

Server tags- If you're new to the game, there are certain tags which you may want to avoid. Norespawn time is self-explanatory, as is allcrits. Playing on a server with nocrits enabled and nodamagespread will help you get a better feel for your class. Try to avoid servers with clan tags, especially if they're soliciting donations. A lot of them will give cheaty perks to people who give them money. Check to see if a server is spoofing its player count by right clicking and viewing the server information. If it's showing 23/24 on the browser but not in the server information, you can safely blacklist it. 

Once you've trimmed down your list, blacklisted all the maps you don't care for (fuck Egypt) and gotten rid of all the achievement/idle/item test servers, you should have about 15-20 (ymmv) servers with decent folks who won't yell at you even if you're terrible.

Wouldn't it be great if there was a manual that covered pretty much everything a newbie needs to know about the game. (the existence of this subreddit proves how many aspects there is to this game)

Like the title says, the last year was spent mostly in silly game modes and goofing off with friends. On occasion when we actually turn on each other and start playing to win, I find myself having more fun. So, starting a few weeks back I've been jumping into random servers and playing.

I main medic and I have pyro and scout on the side and the thing is: I'm not good at any of the three (or at least it doesn't feel like it). I know—practice, play, practice, etc., but it just feels like I'm stuck in a rut. Since I can count the amount of friends I have that like fighting to win on one hand, there's no one to improve and play with all too often. Every once in a while when I drop into servers there's someone that offers a few tips to me, but before I know it they're gone.

Sometimes, the team doesn't need four medics or four pyros so I think about switching to scout to play for a bit before realizing that I die more often than I deal damage.

This is all over the place, but I guess a good summary would be:

1313256217.0,19,self.NewToTF2,jhsp9,"There are no noob weapons, only noob players.",brizzelia,29,10,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/jhsp9/there_are_no_noob_weapons_only_noob_players/,"Let's take a look on two weapons commonly referred as ""noob stuff"", aka ""stop wasting our time"", aka Backburner and Cloak and dagger.

In my humble opinion, the can take your gameplay to a whole new level if used properly.

Let's start with the backburner: Airblasting will be severely limited, I only use it to extinguish teammates, or if a dropped weapon is nearby.
But the main purpose of airblasting - reflecting rockets - never seemed very appealing to me. It's not that hard to dodge rockets with a 100 percent speed class, even the slightly slower Demoman should usually be able to avoid them, if he's fighting 1vs1 with a soldier.

So, what's the ""noob tactic"" of a Pyro? Clearly W+M1. That won't get you anywhere with the Backburner. The vast damage bonus will be entirely useless if you're trying this, and all Flamethrowers are short-ranged, so any back-pedaling enemy will be able to avoid it.

It's much more about height advantage, flanking, cornering. The ability to leap down on a heavy and kill him before he's turned around makes this weapon a valid option.
Sure, Axtinguisher will usually do more damage, but I find the nice little extras of the other melee weapons quite more useful (e.g., homewrecker). 
Last point: Backburner gives you an edge over other pyros, just run back and flame them, if the stop following you, Shotgun in the face.
_______________________________

Number two, probably one of the most hated weapons, as some spies seem to use it for ""invisible idling"", waiting for a perfect opportunity that will never come. 

I top scored in a recent match without even trying to be careful. As long as you're avoiding Pyros, your ability to hide in plain sight allows very aggressive espionage.

Don't waste your cloak by running around invisible, use it when there's any acute danger, and you'll be fine. Defending on Dustbowl, I was literally just standing there (at a wall right next to the gates) and picked some easy targets. Got caught only once when I made the mistake to run for a health pack and got revealed by stray bullets.

But the fun part began later, at BLU spawn. Our engineers were pretty much dominated, sentries down, the defense barely holding up.
So I went for the teleporters and gunned them down. Again, and again, and again. Occasionally killed the engineer when I had the opportunity. At the end, we merely had a level 1 sentry, but the destruction of teleporters was enough to hold the ground.

Conclusion: Cloak and Dagger is the No. 1 most effective tool to find and attack weak spots in the enemies team. And it is pretty silent, even without the Fez set. Always go for easy targets (snipers, heavies, teleporters), and you'll be able to take out a good chunk of them.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_jhsp9,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/jhsp9/there_are_no_noob_weapons_only_noob_players/,

1280179904.0,19,self.NewToTF2,ctypw,Some tips on scout from a thread at /r/tf2,,21,2,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ctypw/some_tips_on_scout_from_a_thread_at_rtf2/,"A thread on /r/tf2 started on the scout [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/ctttf/okay_tf2_how_do_i_scout/) and I gave a few ideas - was asked to post it here.

On good days I am a pretty good scout. Although there are a couple of scouts who frequent reddit who are much better and can kick my ass. For what its worth here are my 2cents: 

1. Practice and learn to use your weapons. Basic, but when I first picked up the sandman I thought it was the worst weapon ever. Now I can pick out a heavy from across the floor, kill his medic and get a shot off before I escape. Working with a team, the stun can shut down one player and allow your teammates to take the advantage. I know competitive tf2 doesn't use sandman, but I personally love it and its my default load out. 

2. The scout is super powerful in some locations, but extremely vulnerable in others - learn what these are. A made for scout map is koth nucleus. Huge open spaces and several levels making the most of his jumping in mid air ability. Very easy to escape. A very bad map for scouts is anything with narrow corridors or blind corners. 

3. At close range soldiers are instant death, firing heavies are instant death, lvl 2 and above sentries are death. Soldiers can kill you by pointing at their feet (I think this is the lamest thing ever) and the direct hit turns you into red mist, firing heavies can kill in 2 seconds or less. Learn to disable them from a distance - hit and run. hit and run and avoid close confrontations. Natasha is a killer - get out asap. 

4. Pistol is great - back peddle and load clip after clip into those chasing you. Pistol can also take out unattended sentries - it has great range. Pistol is extremely effective against pyros who tend to think they can fry scouts easily. When they are flaming backpeddle and shoot pistol, when they take out flare or shotgun advance and use scattergun.

5. I don't care what anyone says: the choice between scattergun and FaN is simply a matter of the current game play. If I am playing against heavies or on a map with a pit, I will load up the FAN in order to push enemies around so I can escape or cause environmental deaths. Pretty much all other times I use the scattergun - its very powerful. 

6. Be aggressive against demos, pyros, engies (without sentries), snipers, spies. Be cautious against battle medics and other scouts (look at your health). Be very careful against heavies and soldiers. 

7. Avoid direct (face to face) confrontations. Approach from the side and hit and run. Learn to aim while in the air and jumping/double jumping. Firing at speed with a mid-air change of direction can close the deal. 

8. Learn the Tyson stalk, advance moving side to side at random intervals. Learn the last minute dodge. Huntsman arrows and soldier rockets can be dodged if you anticipate when they fire. Its not as hard as it sounds because the scout is so fast. 

Hope this is helpful.

This isn't to say that I don't know my way around a scattergun.  I enjoy the casual side of the game, and spend most of my time hopping servers, trying out mod servers, playing with scripts, and generally trying to have a good time.

Here's a couple of my favorite 'off the cuff' tips:

- As a **Heavy**, round corners by jumping and winding up your gun.  As you land, you'll be ready to fire at whatever might be waiting for you.

- As a **Pyro**, air-blasting is a practice of timing and know-how.  Try air-blasting an uber'd enemy near a friendly sentry gun, air blasting sticky/rocket jumping enemies, or reflecting rockets at an enemy's feet for spectacular results.  If you're feeling very daring, try using an enemy rocket to rocket jump! 

- As a **Soldier**, learning to rocket jump is an essential point of becoming more mobile.  You may know about the standard jump and crouch method to rocket jumping, but have you tried [duck-tapping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nm-BGnaBCgE)? 

- As a **Scout**, aiming the scatter gun can be a challenge due to your immense speed.  Practice aiming by keeping your mouse steady and strafing your cross hair over enemies.  When facing enemy scouts, try to match their strafing and take the shot.

- As a **Spy**, trick-stabs aren't always practical, but they're always fun.   Try luring enemies up a ramp or stairs, then jump on(and crouch!) or over and behind them and plant the knife in their back for a stair stab.

- As an **Engineer**, aside from spies and demos, your biggest enemies are shallow corners and wide open spaces.  When placing a sentry, be mindful of the biggest factors that cause sentry death.  Edging(firing around a corner or over a wall), out-ranging(firing out of range the sentry), ambushing (dropping on and overwhelming a sentry) and splashing (using stray explosives to deal damage) are all valid and effective techniques used to destroy sentries without the use of an ubercharge.

- As a **Medic**, being ubered means you are invulnerable.  Use your own body to shield friendly players from incoming rockets and bullet fire, and shield your patient from sentry-gun knock back(Run in front of them) to give them a steadier shot.

- As a **Demoman**, it can be easy to forget that sticky bombs will cling to most surfaces.  Don't be afraid to leave sticky traps on low ceilings or behind door frames to catch enemies off guard.

- As a **Sniper**, you may not be able to receive full damage from a quick-scope shot, but you can still earn a head-shot critical.  Use these to quickly dispatch light enemies(Snipers, spies, scouts, engineers, and especially medics) or severely weaken heavier enemies(-150 HP from Soldier, Demo, Pyro, and Heavy.)  

Bonus, my motto and Strange Sniper Rifle description:  *""One in the body, one in the head.  It wasn't a good shot, but you're still dead.""*

tf2ware - a collection of very fast-paced minigames, like those in the game it gets its name from, Warioware (50.23.91.146:27015)

Prop Hunt - One team plays as scouts who are disguised as props (bushes, trash cans, etc.), and the other team tries to find and kill them (74.55.49.244:27015, or search ph_)

Randomizer - Your class and weapons are random, and change each time you die. The weapons given to you are not necessarily weapons that your class would normally be using - for example, you may be a sniper with Ali Baba's Wee Booties, Quick-Fix, and Gunslinger. There are also custom weapons that are not seen in normal games, such as the Fighter's Falcata and Texas Ten-Shot. (216.52.148.112:27015)

Zombies - After 30 seconds, one person is randomly selected as a zombie (they switch to red team). After that, anyone who dies becomes a zombie, and together they hunt down ""survivors"" with their melee weapons. 4 heavy limit and 2 engineer limit. (72.26.196.46:27015, or search zom_)


Edit - more game modes, and corrections from commentors:


Versus Saxton Hale - One player becomes Saxton Hale or another super-powerful character, and must fight all the other players on the server. Certain weapons work differently in this mode. (search vsh_)

Dodgeball - An arena style game mode where pyros can practice reflecting rockets.  (search tfdb_)

Horde mode - Fight waves of bots by yourself. There are several options for buffs. I've never tried this game type.

1328520063.0,18,self.NewToTF2,pd02e,Mini-Sentry Offensive/Defensive Engineer w/ Vanilla Shotgun Strategy,FuckYouImFunny,18,0,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/pd02e/minisentry_offensivedefensive_engineer_w_vanilla/,"I just wanted to give a strategy guide on a mini-sentry Engy. I feel that the class is one of the most powerful classes because it is so versatile. An Engineer is really pivotal for a team (in a pub that is) in that they can heal (dispenser), get people to the front line (teleport), and even be really offensive (mini-sentry + wrangler + shotgun).

My load out is Vanilla Shotgun, Wrangler, and the Gunslinger. Before I proceed to give some hints I find it better to give the cold hard facts of the Engy's weapons/equipment.

**Mini-Sentry**

* 100 health (300 when Wrangled)
* 100 metal cost
* 48 damage per second (96 when Wrangled)
* 3 seconds to build (1.5 when picked up and placed)

**Vanilla Shotgun**

* 86-90 point blank damage
* 24-67 midrange damage
* 3-26 longrange
* 6 bullets fully loaded, 36 ammo

**Dispenser**

* Level 1 Dispenser: 100 metal, heals 10/sec, 20% ammo/sec, 40 metal/sec
* Level 2 Dispenser: 300 metal, heals 15/sec, 30% ammo/sec, 50 metal/sec
* Level 3 Dispenser: 500 metal, heals 20/sec, 40% ammo/sec, 60 metal/sec

**Teleport**

* Level 1: 10 seconds recharge time
* Level 2: 5 seconds recharge time
* Level 3: 3 seconds recharge time

First and foremost, a mini-sentry IMO is supposed to be a distraction. However, people tend to ignore it because they think it doesn't do a lot of damage (not true). I've seen people who Kritz against my team focus more on people rather than the mini-sentry. This ends up being a terrible mistake because a mini-sentry deals a lot of damage per second. Couple the mini-sentry with your vanilla shotgun and you should be able to take out a Soldier if your mini-sentry is a good distance away.

* You need to be an *Engineer* and not an offensive machine. That means set up Dispensers in hidden areas where your teammates are pushing/defending and building teleports. The only time you should skip those is if you're team is pushing incredibly fast or if your mini-sentry keeps dying on defense and they're pushing your team fast. You are a family man.

* I don't use Frontier Justice because of the 3 bullets per clip compared to the vanilla's 6 bullets. I like to rush my enemies with the shotgun as I place my sentry. This is normally the best option against all the classes besides Pyro, as the closer you get to them, the more damage you dish out with your shotgun as the mini-sentry builds. If you're going against classes like a Soldier, they might end up doing more damage to themselves as well since they'll have to shoot near themselves. If you have your mini-sentry behind you and can dish out 50 damage/sec with your shotgun, you're doing 100 damage/second to your opponent (with the 48 dmg/sec from the mini-sentry).

* I like to normally build a mini-sentry right behind a corner so I can pick it up and place it. It takes 1.5 seconds to build up if you do that, and it really catches people off guard. If you're able to run in with your shotgun, you can dish out a ton of damage. This is a specialty you should learn to master, especially when your teammates are pushing. No one thinks to shoot at the mini-sentry when a medic + someone else are nearby. It pushes people back and injures/kills them. It also distracts them (there's a flashing light on it for a reason) which allows your teammates to survive as your mini-sentry might be their next target.

* Wrangle your gun to take out classes that are far away. It sounds stupid, but people forget the extra damage bonus and the extra defensive bonus. It is insanely strong and insanely powerful because it can really push a team back. You can run forward to them as you wrangle your mini-sentry behind you, and then place a new mini-sentry once you're closer and then switch to your shotgun. 

* If you're getting chased by someone and have metal, I like to build a mini-sentry behind me, pull out my shotgun, and back pedal and shoot while they focus on me or the mini-sentry. It's a great plan since they waste ammo on the mini-sentry and you're able to damage them as you move farther away. It's worked a lot and will save your life.

* Continue building mini-sentries like wildfire. If you don't constantly have one up, you're playing it wrong. On offense, make sure you build them at a middle-long range distance where it will still trigger to attack the enemy. It deals the same damage regardless of how far/close it is to the enemy, so you might as well build it farther away so it's harder for them to destroy it. It is stupid how a mini-sentry deters Pyros/Scouts... it seriously will keep a team at bay if you keep building one and have teammates who can spam. 

* Do not carry a Dispenser/Teleport half way across a map. You're job is to push the cart and make a safe haven of a base. The only thing you should move (and a short distance at that) is the mini-sentry. You have to continue to build and move a mini-sentry up as your team pushes. Build Dispensers/Teles after you've secured a particular location on the map.

* Script your keys so you can build new sentries, dispensers, and teles at the push of a button. I have my F key binded as destroying my old mini-sentry and building the new one. F2-F4 for Dispensers/Teles. It is crucial you do this, otherwise you'll have a harder time building mini-sentries again and again. 

* Downhills/Uphills are your friends. Instead of placing them on a flat surface in front of an uphill, place it a few feet behind the flat surface on the uphill. This positions the mini-sentry further back, and it also is much harder to see and destory. I will include a picture if people are confused because I didn't explain it all that well.

* Mini-sentry Engy w/ Vanilla SG is much more useful on offense than defense. On defense, you should only be one if people tend to ignore your mini-sentry and you're able to build a dispenser/teleport to help your team out.

You will win MVP if you do everything correctly. You push the cart, capture points, get kills/assists, get healing points (or extinguishing), and teleport points.

[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmHlez5rDi0&amp;context=C3331fafADOEgsToPDskJKCVR9WnMaWBSkuS4Dq0iR) is a rare Defense mini-sentry Engy for me with annotations. I normally only ever play on Offense, but I figured what the hell and played it. It starts halfway through Goldrush and the other team wasn't *great*, so I was able to continue playing it.

It's been almost 3 months since we established a recommended server list for NewtoTF2.

As many of you have noticed, the battle field has changed quite a bit.  The rush of new players has subsided, and the remaining recruits have learned more than just their controls.  

What servers would you recommend to your comrades?  This is an opportunity for you to share your favorite servers with players looking for a good time and a challenge.  

*Attention Server Admins*, this is also a time to recommend your servers to inject some new life into your community.  Servers with communicative and responsible admins are good servers.  If you're an admin and an active member of the TF2, TrueTF2, TF2Trade, or NewtoTF2 communities, be sure to say so.


Note: There is no need to recommend the Official/Unofficial Reddit servers.  They will be linked to separately in the new server list.

When recommending a server, please include the following details:

* Name
* IP address
* Map Types (Rotation/24-7, Payload/CTF/CP, etc.)
* Description of the community (Young/Adult, Mature/Family Friendly, etc.)
* Average Difficulty/Skill Levels (Good/inexperienced players, little/""precision tactical nuking"" teamwork, etc.)
* What makes it a great server.

1279588508.0,19,self.NewToTF2,crfi4,Public service announcement: the vanilla syringe gun gives you faster passive HP regeneration than the blutsauger,Kuiper,19,0,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/crfi4/public_service_announcement_the_vanilla_syringe/,"When the blutsauger first came out, it was basically an upgrade over the original needle gun, and there wasn't any reason not to use it.  However, on [September 15, 2009](http://store.steampowered.com/news/2825/), **Valve buffed the syringe gun so that it grants the medic an increase in passive HP regeneration compared to the blutsauger**.  (Technically, in this update, both guns got buffed: the syringe gun got a huge buff, and the blutsauger got a very minor buff.)

If you wish to confirm this, open up your backpack and look at the Blutsauger.  You'll see that it has a negative attribute of ""-2 health drained per second on wearer.""  This stacks with the medic's passive regen, reducing it from a respectable 3-6 HP per second to a more meager 1-4 HP per second.  Note that the blutsauger regen penalty applies to any time you have the weapon equipped as part of your loadout, even if you are holding your medigun or melee weapon.

To further explain how this mechanic affects gameplay:

In case you haven't noticed, the medic passively regenerates HP if he isn't taking damage. Your HP regeneration is based on a range based on when you last took damage.  If you just took damage, you regenerate HP at the slowest rate possible.  Your regeneration rate scales upward for 10 seconds until you hit the ""maximum"" regen rate.

The ""default"" rate of HP regeneration for the medic is 3-6 HP.  That is, you heal 3 HP/sec if you just took damage, and 6 HP per second if you haven't taken damage in the past 10 seconds.  However, the blutsauger gives the medic's passive HP regeneration a passive debuff of -2 HP per second.  A blutsauger medic that has just taken damage heals at 1 HP per second, and a blutsauger medic that has not taken damage in the past 10 seconds will heal at 4 HP per second.

Does the syringe gun's passive regen buff really give it that big of an advantage over the blutsauger?  I did some experimentation using the hurtme command inside spawn.  (The results I got were slightly different from what I had expected; the way that the game rounds is kind of funky.)  Here are some comparisons (based on the experimental results):

* A syringe gun medic who takes damage, then takes no damage during the next 10 seconds will recover a total of 40 damage during that time.  A blutsauger medic will only recover 18 damage in that time.

* A syringe gun medic who takes damage, then takes no damage during the next 5 seconds will recover a total of 15 damage.  A blutsauger medic will only recover 5 damage in that time.

The bottom line is that, when you are not actively using your primary weapon, the syringe gun is a better choice than the blutsauger.  If you are a medic who spends all of his time healing instead of attacking, it's recommended that you stick with the vanilla syringe gun.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_crfi4,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/crfi4/public_service_announcement_the_vanilla_syringe/,

I always avoided playing like this and only just now learned how to be mediocre at it. But I just wanted to share some things I've learned that have made Demoknighting quite fun instead of an exercise in masochism. 

For me, I've found the best load out is either of the shoes (they're both the same, just cosmetically different), the Splendid Screen, and the Persian Persuader.

The shoes/pegleg give you extra hit points so you have 200 HP like the Soldier. The Persian Persuader does not shave your hit points, allows faster build up in charge (crucial for me), and ammo boxes act like health kits (this is a great help).

The Splendid Screen I have found better than the Chargin' Targe despite the latter's increase in fire and explosion damage. The Splendid Screen deals much more damage on impact which is crucial for what I call ""Hit and Slit"". It also produces a satisfying ""Awww!"" when you hit someone; something I don't believe the Targe does.

The best way to play I've found is to act like a spy. You can't rush head first into battles. Despite your high HP, you're still extremely vulnerable. You have to sneak behind enemy lines and catch people unaware. With the PP you can charge more frequently which is useful for zipping past heated battles and/or sentries; and also when you need to escape a hornet's nest of players you've previously killed. They start coming for you.

This is the basic strategy of attack. When you catch someone unaware, charge, hit, and then slit. Wait for everything to shake before slitting so you don't cancel your charge. I've found hitting from behind is most successful. I don't know if there is a damage bonus but it sure seems like it. Hit and slit and their heads come right off. I'm not sure about the math but it seems like I can take out heavies like this (they may have be a little low on health already though). 

Successfully done, it is absolutely devastating like a backstab. But worse because I know from being on the receiving end that you just don't expect a Demoknight to take you out like that. It's very frustrating. So delivering this gift to someone else is very satisfying.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_17e8yb,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/17e8yb/a_brief_guide_to_playing_demoknight/,

1347857296.0,17,self.NewToTF2,100bia,I feel like I've reached a skill-level block.,toxicthunder,19,2,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/100bia/i_feel_like_ive_reached_a_skilllevel_block/,"Hello everyone. 

I am not really new (~300 hours of TF2), but still relatively new to TF2. I main engineer, spy, pyro and soldier. And for each of these classes, I feel like I've come to some sort of mid-level block: I cant seem to get better.

Compared to back when I started (about 2 months ago), I am relatively better at every class than I was before (except Scout, hate it). I like playing spy, soldier, pyro, engineer, medic and sometimes demoman and sniper. 

Anyway, I cant seem to get better at any of the classes I like to play. My K/D ratio is normally 2:1 on almost all pubs, much better than 1:5 I used to have before I started playin TF2 (and I know this isnt a good indicator). Anyway, here is my list of problems with each classes:

**Soldier:**

I HATE scouts. I can deal with them at close range, but at mid-range and long range, they are impossible to kill for me. My rockets almost always miss, and my shotgun does little damage. So, I just RJ away, or suicide by going near him and shooting a rocket near me. So, any advice on how to deal with scouts would be good.

My normal Loadout: The Original or RL, Reserve Shooter, Escape Plan.

**Pyro:**

This is the class which I feel like I have reached a max skill level at. I pretty much do everything that pyros should do: cause chaos, extinguish players, reflect rockets, and guard sentries (using homewrecker as melee). But, I still cannot kill soldiers with their reflected rockets. Good soldiers almost always kill me. Scouts are less of a problem, because if they come close, I burn them, and far away they are not much of a problem. Snipers are also not a problem because I use the Flare Gun. The main problem I have is DEMOMEN. I cant reflect their pipes and stickies (while they're launching it). Another problem is I almost always get killed by a trickstab. The sad thing is, I KNOW that the spy is going to trickstab me. So I go in thinking I can counter that trickstab, but he gets me. Which is even more humiliating than being low skilled. So, any help on how to deal with soldiers, demomen and trickstabs would be much appreciated. 

Also, quick question on a certain situation I frequently end up in. Say, there's 3 of my team: me as pyro, a medic and a soldier. There is lot of spam that the soldier is taking in. I am far from the spam and looking out for spies and flanks, while the medic is healing the soldier. Now, the soldier gets lighted on fire by the enemy. Should I go in and extinguish him? He is low on health, and healing from medic only helps a little when there are flames. But, if I go close, I would also get hit by spam, and most likely die. What would you do in this situation (basically, *try to* save your team or *save* yourself)?

*My normal loadout:* Stock Flamethrower, Flare Gun, Axtinguisher (or Homewrecker depending on my role). 

*Small note:* I prefer stock flamethrower because for a long time I did not have the degreaser. So I got used to using the flamethrower and flare gun. THen, when I could finally craft the degreaser, I felt that the afterburn and damage was really weak, like my flames didnt matter at all. So I stopped using it. Should I use it again?

**Engineer:**

I like playing both the offensive AND defensive engineer. Particularly, I prefer playing offensive because sitting behind sentries is particularly boring. Anyway, what I fail to do is understand *when* to be an engineer. I will always see an enemy team having 2-3 engies and us living in a mini sentry hell. So, next round, I decide to be an engineer, but its useless because their spy get all my mini sentries. So, when do you decide to be an engineer? Also, can someone please tell me the priority of buildings - is it teleporter &gt; dispenser &gt; sentry (specially when I'm and offensive engineer)?

*My normal loadout:* Shotgun (or Pomson), Pistol, The Jag on defense, and Frontier Justice, Pistol and Gunslinger on offense.

**Medic:**

Medic is the class I love playing, because at the end of any round, you are ALWAYS credit to the team. Anyway, I know when to heal players, how to prioritize, and not pocket the same person all the time. But, the thing I suck is at WHEN to pop an uber. Say, I have an uber, but there are not that many enemy players to take care of *at the moment*. So, I wait till the person I am pocketing starts taking damage. But then, BAM, he gets hit by rockets and pipes and stickies and what not, and I'm their next target so I uber to save myself (and flash it on the way out to a pyro). But, that just wastes an uber. How do you know when to uber?

Quick question: Who should I uber at the start of payload map - Heavy, pyro, soldier or demoman? (Both as defense and offense).

*My normal loadout:* The Medivial Medic - Crusaders Crossbow, Medigun and Amputator.

Hope that wasnt long enough that you got bored while reading it! Also, I'm and F2P so I cannot use any item set that requires a hat. And another reason why I cannot keep an arsenal of weapons. If you think that me recording as I play would help you give me better advice, please let me know and I will record one.

If you have yet to take notice, R/NewToTF2 has two new Mods.

Our good friend [Lapper](http://steamcommunity.com/id/infinitegaze), an experienced competitive TF2 player, trainer, active member of NewToTF2.  He hosts regularly competitive minded classes **in game** for members of our community to benefit from.  Be sure to catch them at their [new location](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/medic101), even if you feel comfortable where you are now.  The classes offer a wealth of knowledge, and you never know what new trick you might not have picked up yet.

And myself, [Nai](http://steamcommunity.com/id/NaiDriftlin), a writer and hat enthusiast.

I will allow Lapper to speak for himself in his own time, but I wanted to take a moment to introduce myself and my intentions here as the new mod of R/NewToTF2.

In short, I am I hands-off kind of guy.  This subreddit is filled with inquisitive and intelligent people.  The thing I like about these types of people is that they manage and moderate themselves.  With that said, I look forward to being a servant of this great community when the opportunity(Or, more likely, need) arises.

In the meantime, here are a couple things I would like you to consider, R/NewToTF2.  If you would like to answer these questions, feel free to comment here so we can talk about it.  Opinions and additions are welcome.

**The Sidebar**

Q1: Is there anything specific we should add to the sidebar, such as the TeamFortress.com website or specific wiki pages?

Q2: Would you like to see a nomination system in R/NewToTF2, to add impressive or inspiring posts/links to the sidebar?


Edit: Regarding the Sidebar.  I am waiting a bit for feedback, then I'll make a single, bulk change to the side bar.

You're not ""wasting a slot,"" as any medic is better than no medic. And there's no such thing as too many medics either! of all the support classes, 3-4 medics on a team is not only the least common, but also the most potent. 

* Remember: **YOU** are more important than the guy you're healing. If he's taking heavy damage even with your healing, don't feel bad about running away. Retreat, and find a new guy to heal ASAP. 

* Don't overstretch your safety zone. Hide behind corners, don't put yourself in the line of fire for no reason. Don't chase after a scout calling for you if he's heading to the front lines. Chances are you'll both die, along with that demo, soldier, and pyro you passed up to get to the scout. 

* Learn how to bravely run away. Don't backpedal and try to get a pick with your syringe gun. You move slower running backwards, putting yourself at greater risk. Turn tail and don't stop jumping. That's right, I said *jump.* not only is it harder to hit you, but shots fired at your back will give you a little push when you're running, aiding your escape. Add a crouch to your jump for best results. 

* If points matter to you, Medic's the class for you. Any medic can rack up points just by healing. You don't need to fire a single shot. 

* Always. Always. **ALWAYS** check your back and everyone around you. Spies are gonna take you and your heal target out if you aren't alert. it's as easy as walking into them. Most spies are too slow to realize they've been found out. Switch to your saw and tear em up (Ubersaw doesn't charge uber against disguised/cloaked spies). Learn to spot a dead ringer, and keep your ears peeled for decloaking. Watch the kill counter in the upper right corner, if you see someone die to a spy and he's apparently standing next to you, saw em to death. It's embarrassing to heal a spy and watch him lazily stab your heal target and get away with it. 

* Learn who on your team is putting in the most work, give them a little priority in your healing. You'll live longer and win more. 

* That doesn't mean ignore everyone else, if you have to make a choice, heal the bulkier classes first. Heal those on fire first or bleeding). Your 450HP overhealed heavy is gonna live, take some time and heal that soldier who just took out a sentry nest. 

* Don't be stingy with your ubercharge. If your heal target suddenly dies or you see a crit rocket on its way, pop that uber. If he died, bravely run away and just heal whomever you see on your team. 

* You can block a capture while ubered, use this in the last few moments of a game to ensure victory. 

* At the same time, you can switch weapons while ubered. There's not many practical uses to this, but nailing consecutive hits with an ubersaw keeps your charge longer. Not advisable, very impractical, but possible. Also, switching weapons allows you to cap a point/move the cart while your heal target has a second or two of ubercharge until his dies off too. if you need the extra push, be a sneaky medic and swap weapons and get the cap!

It may be hard to get the first stab to make this knife effective, and it's much easier on defense than attack.  However, you can stab an engie right next to his gun and not even worry about sapping it since you disguise instantly

**Widowmaker:** Uses your build metal as ammo, no need to reload.  It costs 30 per shot which means you should use it mid-close range for it to at least average the metal you get back, and it's recommended that you equip the pistol with this gun so you at least have a weapon should you run out of metal

I think I've gotten much better since I started (I got the ""First Do No Harm"" achievement today on a big server and we won: it felt really good and I was even congratulated!), but I still need a bit of help. I'm sorry if these have been answered before.

1. I try my best to heal everyone, but it always feels like my entire team is spamming Medic at every moment and I can't reach them in time. My loadout is Overdose/Strange Medigun/Ubersaw by the way. I feel really bad when I can't reach them in time, but no one has yelled at me about it yet.

2. (Branching off of 1...) Me running around like this usually ends up getting me killed, and in a real game I can barely get an ubercharge ready. : (

3. I'm a girl, and extremely shy to boot. I keep hearing that Medics should communicate to their team, but how should I go about doing this without getting insulted by the boys playing this game? Apparently my voice isn't that high, though. My friend told me I could pass for a 14-year-old boy.
(Should I just play on the Reddit servers? I don't want to anger people on those because I'm still learning anyway. It seems like a lot of good players frequent them.)

Just run in any diguise, cloak when an enemy spotted you, and wait till they're gone again. You can basically hide anywhere, and the quick recharge is a huge bonus. 
It's a long con tool, allowing you, e.g., to go for the teleporters with minimum risk (or telefrag if you're lucky, otherwise it'll most likely earn you a wrench to the face).
Once the teleporters are down, you can either stalk slow classes from their respawn (a friendly player running forward from the respawn isn't very suspicious), or wait for an opportunity, like a sniper or engineer who's just a little too far from the teammates.

In fact, I think the Dead Ringer may actually slow you down more than the CnD, as it leaves you so vulnerable when it's not fully charged. It's fast in the approach, making it easier to circumvent the defenses, but without metal supplies, you'll be either really slow or really vulnerable.

tl, dr:

Never underestimate the potential of so-called noob weapons. If used right, they can be devastating.

Edit: Concerning the dead ringer

- yes, the perfect cloak and only 10 percent damage is awesome, but there's still the biggest weakness,
without 100 percent cloak meter, it will do absolutely nothing.

If the enemy stands together, you're going to risk getting attacked again before your cloak is refilled - or you'll have to take the long way, wait for recharge or even fall back to the next ammo box.

It rewards rushing in for chain-stabs, which is always somewhat luck-based, while the CnD makes it easier to approach valuable targets.

As you've been browsing for servers to play on, you may have noticed that there are a ton of different game modes.  The [TF2 Wiki has a full list of all game modes](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/List_of_game_modes), but I'm going to break them down into simpler terms here for you.


A simple way to tell the game mode is by the first letters of the name of any map in the server list.  This will usually be followed by an underscore, then the name of the map.  Sometimes the same map will have differences for different game types.  There are also other custom map / mode types, but the primary ones are listed here.


* **[pl_ : Payload](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Payload)**  The object of this game mode is for one team to ""push"" the cart from one end of the map to the objective in a set amount of time while the other team attempts to stop them.  On the cart's tracks are several checkpoints, and reaching a checkpoint opens different areas of the map, as well as adds more time for the pushing team to finish.  Pushing is done by simply standing near the cart, and it automatically moves along the tracks.  The more people that stand near the cart, the faster it moves.  If no one is near the cart for a set amount of time, it will start moving backwards, but will not move past the most recent checkpoint or the beginning.  You can see the current progress of the cart at the bottom of the screen, which will indicate how many players are near it, and if it is moving forwards or backwards.  The cart also acts like an engineer's dispenser, as it will give out ammo and slowly refill health while you are near it.

* **[plr_ : Payload Race](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Payload_Race#Payload_Race)**  This game has the same objective as Payload, except that both teams have a cart, and both teams are trying to push it to the final objective while preventing the other team from moving theirs.

* **[ctf_ : Capture The Flag](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Capture_the_Flag)**  The objective is to get into the team's base, capture their ""intelligence"", and bring it back to your intelligence room in your base.  If the intelligence is dropped, it will remain in place for 60 seconds, and afterwords will return to the base.  Indicators on the screen will show the status of each intelligence and where on the map it is in relation to yourself.  Usually in these maps, each side of the base is an exact mirror image of the other.

* **[cp_ : Control Point](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Control_Point_%28game_mode%29)** The objective of Control Point is to stand on a point until it is ""captured"" by your team.  There are two types of Control Point maps.  One is where a team will attack while the other defends, with the objective for one team to capture all points, also known as ""Attack/Defend"".  The other type is ""Standard"", where there are control points that each team controls, and only one point can be captured at any given time; you must capture a point to unlock another, but the other team can capture it back from you!

* **[arena_ : Arena](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Arena)** Two teams, one life, fight to the death!  After a set amount of time, a central Control Point will open, whichever team can capture it before they all die will win.

* **[koth_ : King of the Hill](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/King_of_the_Hill)** A single control point in the middle of the map is fought over for control.  When under your team's control, the timer will count down.  If control is lost, the timer stops at where it was and starts ticking down for the other team.  Whoever can hold the control point for 3 minutes total wins!

* **[tc_ : Territorrial Control](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Territorial_Control)** Two random sections of the map are set up for fighting over; after being captured, it moves on.  Whichever team captures four points will have an opportunity to capture the enemy team's base, and will win the map!


This is just a brief overview, and I hope it will help clarify things for a lot of new players!

How/where does airblast properly fit in during this process?

The axe is melee range.  How do you close the gap between you and the enemy in order to land the hit?  In my early attempts I end up just flailing my axe around a foot away from my enemy as he fills me with lead ""-_-

And possibly related:  I sometimes see pyros swing their flamethrower like an axe... what is that?  Is that an axe swing? (just like how taunts can be done holding a different weapon by switching quickly)  If so how do they switch and swing so fast?

They're fairly quick, have a good amount of health, and wield a gun with a very clear purpose: to light shit on fire. This initially appears to be, and can at times be, a very easy task. Players new to the class quickly pick up on the concept - run into enemies wildly spraying fire and stuff will die. The Pyro is also a very versatile class and the ability to have an offensive, support or defensive role can quickly teach the teamwork dynamic of the game, but some players never move past the run + fire strategy they first picked up.

W+M1 Pyros are those who play Pyro that simply kamikaze you invariably, holding down W (Forward) and M1 (Left-click/fire). No strafing, no airblasts, no trying to outwit the other player - just fire + run at opponent. With enough experience this makes them easy to deal with almost all of the time, but you can almost imagine the player on the other side of the screen just simply holding down the mouse and the W button and then getting frustrated at their repeated deaths.

Effectively playing a Pyro requires a different mindset. Pyros are weak on frontal attacks—they will lose to most other classes if they see him coming. However, if they catch the enemy by surprise, Pyros are the most dangerous class in the game. Always try for an Ambush. Learn the maps and use side corridors rather than main ones. Use your speed to your advantage and *flank*!

Also helpful:

* Learn to light enemies up, realize when you need quickly retreat and return with your shotgun, letting that damage plus the afterburn (50-60 damage) finish them off. 
* Strafing and circlestrafing should be your best friends - pyros have low health but move quickly, so go heavy on the flames to maximize confusion and keep moving and circling enemies.
* Learn the arc on the flare gun; once you can aim well with it it's massively useful, especially on enemies standing still or moving slowly (heavies, snipers). Since a recent update, the flare gun now deals mini-crits to enemies already on fire, making it particularly effective for lighting-up-and-retreating. It's also great for weakening big groups, and aiming in these cases is a piece of cake. By using walls and corners to hide behind, pop out and shoot a flare, hide again to reload and repeat you will be tricky to hit and you'll have weakened the group(/individual) before they even get to you.
* Pyros are the only class in the game that can _counter projectiles_ - it almost seems crazy to type that out! What an amazing ability! And yet very few players seem to even know that the airblast (M2/right-click) exists. You can use it to offensively blast projectiles back in the face of those who shot them (timing is key here - you'll get the hang of it fairly quickly, but it might take a while before you get very good at it), defensively move sticky bombs from troublesome spots or objective points, extinguish teammates on fire, blast players off ledges, or delay enemies (simply by blowing them backwards, into obstructions or into the air - this is particularly devious on Ubercharged pairs! If you can keep them back or seperate the medic from the other CP it can mean a wasted Uber for the other team). The list goes on. This should be your best friend.

And don't forget to taunt. Pyros have the coolest taunt in the whole freakin' game.

1346198619.0,16,self.NewToTF2,yzoux,So you want to become premium? My very personal opinion on what to buy.,rhoparkour,21,5,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/yzoux/so_you_want_to_become_premium_my_very_personal/,"I've been seeing a lot of posts asking what is the best thing to buy to become premium, so here are my two cents. First, something to keep in mind.

**Prices in the store do not correspond to prices in the TF2 trading economy.** Additionally, all items from the store are also ""dirty,"" in the sense that they lose a lot of value because they are uncraftable. Hats/misc from the Mann Co store are basically worthless in the trading community. For example, a ""dirty"" Archimedes goes for about 2-3 keys, about $5 or $7.50, contrasting this with the $12 from the store. A ""clean"" Archimedes goes for about 6-7 keys, about $15 dollars in keys. (I am not going to go into purchasing keys from third parties, I am well aware of the reduced price of keys, the point still holds with the Mann Co prices, and is stronger when keys are cheaper)

Chances are you want to get into trading, or you just really want to get this one hat. The steam wallet has a $5 dollar minimum purchase, so with that budget you have ***four*** options:

* 2 keys, which can be sold for about 2.5 refined metal each. Meaning the 2 keys should go for 5 refined. (A word on this, 0.33 refined is a reclaimed metal, 0.11 is a scrap metal, so 2.5 is 2 refined + 1 reclaimed + 2 scrap.)
* A backpack expander, which can be sold for 6-7 refined metal, if I remember correctly. This one is much harder and time consuming to sell.
* 5 tour of duty tickets, which seem to be trading for 1.66 refined each, for a total of 8.33 refined. Thanks to mikey12345 for this price update. I would recommend getting the sixth one if you actually want to play MvM, just to do the whole tour.
* Buy the cheapest thing in the Mann Co. store, as genemilder pointed out the leftover money can be used to buy any cheap enough steam game.

Usually, with any of these options you have enough to trade for the hat/misc you want, provided it isn't something new like the Last Breath or Archimedes. If you don't care if your items are dirty or not, you're still better off buying the keys and then trading for the hat you want.

*If you're looking for weapons, don't buy them from the store, most go for a a scrap in the trading community.*

An additional option, which is the one I would personally recommend
is to buy six tour tickets for Mann Up mode (for a total of $6), it's super fun and you could get some worthy items out of it.

**Crates are not worth opening.** To get an idea of how bad it is, visit http://uhatsearch.appspot.com/cratesim/

Or if you have like a dollar or something in your steam wallet, buy a sticky jumper, equip your caber and go to hightower.

**TL;DR: Don't buy hats or misc items from the Mann Co store.**

I've just gotten back into playing TF2 after not having played since 2009. Medic is my preferred class, although I dabbled in Pyro for a long time as well. I bought TF2 specifically to play as the Medic. 

I've read the tips and strategies, and I think I'm okay at the basic ""heal everyone, don't die"" routine. Today I hit one of those perfect zen moments where I broke all my current records as Medic -- I stayed alive for over 8 minutes, popped 4 ubers, racked up assist kills, defended the payload checkpoint, and got several achievements out of the deal (including Intern, over 7,000 heal points in a single life!). 

So I'm getting a lot better at avoiding death and just spreading out my healing as best I can, like targeting on fire teammates first, prioritizing and pocketing as needed, etc. The one thing I know I'm still bad at is using the UberCharge correctly. I have just the standard Medic equipment, so that's the invulnerable Uber, and I know it's best used as a push or taking out Sentry Nests... but I most often feel like I'm failing to use them correctly. I know part of the problem is my mic's busted, so I can't communicate effectively, but even still. 

I wanted to ask for advice on being a better Medic -- what's your wishlist of Medic behavior? What ways can I best serve my team? What are your Medic petpeeves, so I can avoid them? What are some of the best ways to communicate when you can't use a mic?

I'm considering renting a 24 player TF2 server from Gameservers. I plan to make this a Newbie Friendly server, there are a lot of F2P players who aren't good, and it would be a nice place for everyone to play without having 5 year veterans coming in and steamrolling everyone.

My question is, does anyone have any experience with Gameservers and would you redditor TF2 newbies be interested? It's not exactly expensive but it's not exactly free either. I would hate to start paying for it only to find out no one is playing there. Of course donations would always be welcome.

Edit:  Everything is all set up, I'm actually surprised but there was already a good amount of players playing, unfortunately after I went to sleep.

1310141055.0,16,self.NewToTF2,ik43u,How to treat your medics (from a non-medic player) ,Duraz0rz,19,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ik43u/how_to_treat_your_medics_from_a_nonmedic_player/,"Disclaimer: I barely play medic. Only when there's no medic on my team and we really need one. I usually play soldier or pyro, but I'm pretty good at medic when I do play it.

Tips for players:

* **Don't hit that medic button unless you're in real danger of dying soon**. I can't stress how annoying it is when it's the middle of an intense fight and 9001 people are calling for medic. The medics know you're hurt; don't need to make it more stressful for them.
* Take care of your damn medic. Save health packs for the medic. If you're a heavy, throw down your sandvich for your medic, if you have it equipped. If you notice his health is low and he's pocketing you, run out of the battle so he can grab health. If you're overhealed and you have rocket spam heading your way, take the hits or airblast it away. **Just don't let him die.**
* Don't even bother calling for a medic if you're a scout. You're the fastest class in the game. Go back behind the lines and pick up a health pack that the medics aren't near.

Tips for medics:

* Don't just uber me once you get 100%. I might be low on ammo or have nothing loaded. A polite warning is sufficient.
* On contrary to above, if you're in danger of dying, **use it**. Better to use your uber than to drop it.
* Try to keep people overhealed, especially demos and soldiers that are liable to inflict self-damage due to their explosions.
* When I play medic, I tend to play triage. I set my medic auto-call to 50% and heal those guys up first.
* Communicate! This ties into the two previous points. If you're about to use your uber, call it out. If you're in danger of dying, call it out. If you see a spy, call it out. The medic is the prime leader class; they can assess the situation easier because they pretty much have to pay attention to everything. The flow of the game depends on medics.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_ik43u,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ik43u/how_to_treat_your_medics_from_a_nonmedic_player/,

1. Would you do it again? (If you couldn't come, what time zone are you in?)

2. What topics do you want to see covered?

1) Use the quick weapon switching option - with this you won't need to left click to select a weapon, it saves a lot of time

2) Don't use the scroll wheel to change weapons (unless it works for you) - my scroll wheel was too sensitive, I often skipped the weapon I wanted to select.

3) If you're not comfortable with the default keys to switch weapons, change them (this one is kinda obvious) - I'm not used to pc gaming and hitting the numbers to switch weapons just didn't work for me. I now use the scroll wheel to replace the number (up for primary, down for secondary, click for melee. For weapon slot 4, I use Q. Mess with the controls and find something that works for you.

4) I personally don't use this, but you can ""bind"" keys. I have no experience with this, but from what I read, you can assign some key combinations (ex: select disguise kit+select disguise) to one key. Experienced players could elaborate for me in the comment. For the rest of you, you can google it.

Thanks for reading and feel free to add other control-related tips.

I know a lot of you are just fresh to TF2, so you're just getting to grips with this wonderful game. It's awesome, and I hope you're enjoying it! 

If you've been browsing /r/tf2 or any of the other TF2 related subreddits, you might have come across the competitive scene. We're a pretty friendly group of people! There are a few leagues, UGC, ETF2L, Ozfortress, AsiaFortress that cater to lots of different forms of competitive TF2 all across the world. It's a pretty exciting scene, but understandably it's hard to know where to start! /r/tf2lft is an excellent resource, and it's where I found my own team! But if everyone is as new as you are, it can be hard to make work, especially in the long seasons of the tournaments.

The Round Robin is pretty awesome in that it's a one day tournament. So you get the feel of progression in a short period of time. There are two tournaments, one a team tournament, and another a mentor tournament for EU players. If you're in the EU we will find you team mates, give you a team mentor to prepare you for the tournament. This is especially geared towards the newer players and is a wonderful experience as you get the benefit of mentoring with players better than you, and you get introduced to a group of people with roughly similar skills, who are looking to get better at the game.

If you **already have a team**, and want to participate, please register using this [**form**](http://theroundrob.in/rrr6teamsignup). NA and EU teams are welcome.

If you're interested in registering as an individual and live in the EU, please register using this [**form**](http://theroundrob.in/rrr6teamsignup).

- **Sombrero(Flare Gun) Pyros**

The Pyro Wave is a simple matter of gunning enemies down.   The best stratedgy is the simplest one: Shoot them dead.   Spys suffer a significant disadvantage in this wave due to how early it is(400 cash means only one upgrade to the sapper, and at most 25% damage to giants on backstab), and scouts and pyros need to be mindful of their health the longer they stay in the fight.  Heavies, soldiers, demos, and engineers will enjoy how relatively easy this round is.

Most importantly, your team should aim for an A+ rating on this wave as being the major goal.  The money will go a long way to help you, and it should be super easy to get.  You can very easily get around needing upgrades/buybacks this wave by having a team of engineers/heavies doing most of the killing, and having a pyro and/or a scout collecting the money.   Yes, that means having 4 engineers and 2 scouts is an absolutely valid method to dealing with this wave, provided no one spends money on upgrades.

Boxing heavies will also spawn, which anyone should be able to take care of.

**MVP(s):** Engineers, Scouts, and Heavies.

**LVP(s):** Spies, due to most of the damage being fire, and being early in the game.

**Common Troubles:** Giant Pyros getting a hold of the bomb while sentries and players are distracted by the larger number of smaller enemies.

 ---------------------------------

**Wave 2:**  *The Lucksman Wave*

**Max Cash(w/Bonus):** 700

**Consists of...**

- **Huntsman Snipers (96 of them!)**
- **Support Spies**

This should be another freebie wave, if played right.    Huntsmen do notoriously large amounts of damage(if not fatal), but have one glaring weakness:  They only have slightly over 100 health.

The Engineer is king of this round, due to his sentry's high rate of fire and immunity to silly things like head shots.  Engineers should build sentries around corners and in robot blind spots, and avoid the rooftop in the center.  The rooftop in the center is a popular place to build a sentry, but Snipers can out range the sentry if it is on autopilot only, and robot spies will be hard to manage if you have to fight both them and the huntsmen snipers at once with the wrangler.  Pay attention to where the bomb carrier will be going, and build for that.  If they are going left, either up the ramp or across the bridge, putting your sentry on the left ramp(either at the top of the ramp, or at the corner of the wooden area close to the rock with the full ammo and full health pack) will cover most of the critical areas, while putting your back to the wall to avoid spies approaching from blind spots.  Spies can only approach from your right flank, or up the ramp on the left, and the sentry's location means you can leave the sentry on autopilot when dealing with spies.  If the robots are going right, you can set the sentry up to face backwards down the narrow alley on the upper right, causing anything that walks into the alley to be quickly shot by the sentry.  Spies can then only approach you directly from the front, or to your right and left flanks, meaning they should be easy to spot in either direction.

The other silent heroes of this wave are Soldiers and Demos.  Demos and soldiers can hide around corners and use stickies/rockets to deal splash damage from safety.  Since both use weapons powerful enough to kill snipers in 1 or 2 hits they can safely dispatch stragglers or partial waves by themselves if they play the corners right.  Heavies enormous close range DPS means that hiding around a corner will work, but without a medic or a dispenser combined with health on kill effects, the heavy may have a hard time staying alive if too many snipers push his corner.

Scouts, spies, and pyros are at a disadvantage in this wave, as is anyone else who may need to get in close quarters with the snipers.

**MVP(s):** Engineer, Soldier, Demo, using corners.

**LVP(s):** Anyone in close range, or anyone not using cover at distance

**Common Troubles:**

- Spies killing the engineer/demo/heavy/soldier and/or sapping the sentry while it is firing on huntsmen.

- Sentry busters coinciding with a wave of Huntsmen rounding the corner a sentry is on.

---------------------------------

**Wave 3:** *Giant Scouts and Little Soldier Boys*

**Max Cash(w/Bonus):** 550

**Consists of...**

- **Giant Scouts (6), spawning 1 at a time**
- **Soldiers**

This wave goes to the Pyro.  No one is better equipped to handle this wave than he is.  However, the pyro's resources can be spread thin as a result, so a pyro with a sense of restraint will go a long way in this wave.  Giant Scouts are fast and durable, but can be stopped by air blasting them into the air.  The rest of the team can then focus them down so long as the pyro holds them in place.    If a scout gets by your team with the bomb, he will, most likely, end the wave before any of you have a chance to get back to spawn.  Your highest priority is stopping that scout.

The soldier waves are very dangerous to exposed sentries and anyone who happens to be inside the tunnel when they touch ground.  NO ONE should be inside the tunnel, near their drop point, or anywhere else without a significant amount of cover as an option.  Pyros should reflect defensively, preferably while retreating to retrieve more ammo for the next giant scout.  If you're going to be a career pyro in this game, expanded ammo tanks as an upgrade is the way to go, but if you're going pyro for this round only, play it safe and restock ammo between giant scouts.  There is a 1/2 ammo box up the left ramp, on the right next to the wall, and there is a full ammo on top of the building in the center if you can't reach a dispenser.  If you're only swapping for the wave, try not to invest too much money into the pyro. Ammo capacity is the most I would spend it on, personally.

Everyone else should be focusing on killing the scouts and soldiers.  Due to the narrow space of which the soldiers have to walk, demomen are very good at crippling waves of soldiers by setting up sticky traps in the tunnel, and detonating them as the soldiers enter the area.   Stagger each sticky to maximize the amount of area it covers, and the rest of your team should be able to quickly mop up what is left.

**MVP(s):** W+M2 Pyro, Demoman.

**LVP(s):** Anyone who stands in the tunnel when the soldiers hit the ground.

**Common Problems:**

- Scouts get past the pyro, or no pyro, Mad Milk scout, Jarate sniper, or spy on the team.

- Pyros trying to be a reflect hero during a soldier spawn and getting killed by soldiers, and is still dead when the next giant scout runs by, or doesn't have any ammo due to reflect spam.

---------------------------------

**Wave 4:** *Rock'Em Sock'Em Heavies*

**Max Cash(w/Bonus):** 500

**Consists of...**

- **Boxing Heavies**
- **Support Spies**
- **Support Snipers**

It's an easy wave.  Believe it or not, this wave's biggest problem is the spies and snipers.  Pyros and heavies should focus on boxers and spies on their level, while scouts, spies and snipers should focus on snipers.  Scouts are the breadwinners in this wave thanks to their speed and ability to quickly catch up to and dispatch both spies and snipers.  Engineers should build their sentry with their backs against a wall(Either on the left or right, depending on where the bomb carrier is going), and leave their sentry on auto-pilot while keeping an eye out for spies, and only swapping to the wrangler to kill distant snipers.

**MVP(s):** Scout

**LVP(s):** Anyone who gets killed by the heavies, and not by the snipers or spies.

**Common Problems:**

- Snipers and spies kill big hitters(Heavy, Soldier, Demo, Engineer, Pyro) and classes with less output are over-run by heavies.

- Sentry buster forcing an engineer to pick up his gear, followed by a sniper or spy killing the distracted engineer.

- Multiple snipers near spawn, killing slower players(Soldiers, demos, heavies) before they can get back into position.

That will let you know more of the situation.

What I'm posting this for is that obviously NewToTF2 needs an official server. I am not done helping with TF2 servers just because of a bad experience and I just setup a 10 slot idle server in hopes to get this started and if not i'll leave the idle one up.

What I want to do is make a single 24 slot server. The cost of this is $28.79/mo. I can cover 10 slots of this myself which is about $11/mo. I'd pay for the whole thing but my finances are as tight as can be right now. I'm not asking for anything crazy. All I need to get this started is $17 and $17 every month on. I don't want some crazy amount of donations because I'm not trying to pocket anything here.

As far as features go I want to hear from the community what you want to see on a server. Obviously I will give items away if they are donated, but what game modes do you guys want to see and what kinds of special events would you like?

**FYI**: I just put up a 24 slot payload and CP server up: 74.91.122.35:27015 (Located in Chicago)

EDIT: **I wanted to come back and state that this server sadly will NOT be an official server for NewtoTF2.

(xpost from r/tf2)",theif519,16,2,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/qv5y3/do_you_think_playing_other_classes_like_soldier/,"I've heard of legendary Medics who used to main other classes before being Medic and it helped them a LOT, as in, dodging, staying alive, and survival. I think Harbleu was one, but I'm not so sure if it was him. I've found that when I first started playing, when TF2 went F2P, I was a terrible Medic. I only healed Heavies and barely healed other classes, the epitome of a terrible Medic. After a while, which was a few months, I started getting progressively better in healing, knowing to stay behind my pocket (Which at the time I only chose Heavies, I didn't know about Pocket Soldiers until I watched my first 6 v 6 broadcast by Salamancer) and I overhealed people, but the thing was, I didn't know how to survive. I went too far forward with my ubers, I only ubered one person despite my dying allies beside me in a push (Don't do this) and after my uber was over I died promptly afterward. Of course I learned to flash my uber, or as some call it, ""Multi-Uber"" to help keep a successful push. Now, where does playing other classes helping come into play? Dodging. When I started Maining Soldier, I started learning how to rocket jump, and that taught me how to AIR STRAFE, which, as a Medic, you need to do. If a Rocket is coming at your feet, you can ride the rocket to safety. I've even went half way across the Map to safety once doing this. Another thing, is that by knowing how the class works, you know how to confront it. You run, of course, but you know that jumping frantically won't work. You don't run in a straight line, you strafe left to right, dodging his rockets, which is what I also do as a Soldier. Also, before I forget, if you've played Spy enough, you start to learn to pick out spies, know their tricks (And trick stabs) and how to get rid of them. Now, on to Scout. As a Scout, you use your speed to your advantage. This is how I improved my strafing as well. Never stay still as a Medic, just as you wouldn't as a Scout. Especially with leading your needles, going left to right in small strafes can make it a nightmare for enemies to hit you. I've even won a few of my 1 v 1 Fights against Scouts with the Overdose in Lobbies, it's not easy, and it's dangerous, but when you're alone and a Scout is looking for an easy pick, it's worth knowing how to strafe. There are other classes which will help you as a Medic, but I can't remember much else right now. If you disagree with me, tell me your reasons. Also, if you agree, feel free to add your own tips.

Protips for Medics: Pop it don't drop it, Heal more than a Heavy, Overheal everyone, Overheal your Demomen and Soldiers first, Uber more than one patient (This can drastically reduce your 8 seconds of invulnerability to 4 - 6, but it's worth keeping your team mates alive, because they keep YOU alive), and (A bit biased here, but...) don't use the Quickfix

EDIT: I remembered another thing, as Demoman, if you're good at planting Stickies in unseen places, you'll be able to predict where they are too.

1322850105.0,13,self.NewToTF2,mxrr2,Initial thoughts trying to play Heavy...,GyantSpyder,17,4,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/mxrr2/initial_thoughts_trying_to_play_heavy/,"Relatively rew player (played about a month and a half) - been moving through the classes trying them out. Had the most fun/success so far with Medic, Soldier, Demoman and Gunslinger Engineer. The last couple of days, I've been playing Heavy, which I'd previously found to be really annoying - very hard to make a difference at all. Wanted to post some initial reactions and questions and ask for feedback from more experienced players.

- There is definitely a temptation to play the Heavy as longer-range - aim at someone or a group of people from somewhere relatively safe from snipers and hope you can just pump out enough bullets to do damage or at least suppress the other team a bit. Any success at all I was having seemed to start when I realized this was stupid. 

(I tried the same tactic with Soldier and was told on this board that was wrong, too. I think it just comes from unfamiliarity with why I am getting killed when I walk out into the open - as I learn the maps better and learn better why I am dying, staying behind cover seems less important.)

- So, how close are you supposed to get with Heavy to be effective, and how important is flanking to do this? I often feel like I have to flank to avoid snipers and close distance on people, but then I also feel like my team probably needs me on the front lines. How do you manage that?

- Is it just me, or do you really, really need a medic as heavy? Playing without a medic just seems so bad. What do you do if the medic on your team is helping somebody else, or if there aren't enough medics or even any medics to go around? (I'm assuming the answer to the last one is ""switch to medic,"" right?)

- How important is the sandvich? I don't have it yet (I have the dolokos bar, which seems useless) - is it important enough that I should trade for it if I want to play Heavy at all, or are there other secondary weapons worth using (like shotgun?).

- Just playing around early on, before I learned what bad value it was, I unboxed a couple of crates. One of the things I found was a strange brass beast, which seems cool and which I've wanted to use. But it just seems terrible! I had thought that combining the brass beast with a more mobile secondary weapon like shotgun or the gloves of running urgently (which I do have) would let me put out more damage without sacrificing an intolerable amount of mobility, but the more I play with it the worse it seems. Is the movement and spin-up penalty as bad as it feels to me, or is brass beast at least playable enough for rookies on public servers? Any tips on how to use it? What is the deal with the different primary weapons?

- Sentry guns are tough to deal with! No other commentary on that, but it's weird playing a class that when it comes across a level 3 sentry is so likely to just plain get killed, despite supposedly being so strong.

- Wow, Jarate is awesome! I never saw quite how good Jarate was until I was playing heavy when my teammates used it.

- Pyros seem to rush at me a lot, which seems suboptimal from their perspective, since even I don't have too much trouble taking them out when they're running at me, even if they're weaving around. But I still feel like I could do better against them. Any tips for how to engage pyros or scouts other than just shoot them and kill them? Again, seems like a good matchup, but it's common enough that improving it would have some benefits.

- I pretty much always load up the Gloves of Running Urgently and use them to sprint to the front lines. Is this a good idea, or should I be using a different melee weapon?

- Are there any aiming tricks for heavy like there are for other classes? Aim at a particular part of the body or fire at a particular time? Or do you basically just point and shoot?

- Same question, but with movement. Should I be strafing? Taking high ground? Going around corners? What is good Heavy positioning, and how do you move around in a firefight?

Rushing leads to poor decisions, like not price checking, not checking if the person is an impostor, or the items are imposters.

** Price check **

This is very important when dealing with valuable items(not so important with normal weapons). You can look at past trades, google search or ask (/r/tf2trade can help) for a price check. However, for obvious reasons, you can't trust the person that you're trading with for a good price check.

**Remember that normal weapons are really, really cheap compared to all other items besides crates**

You can buy most normal weapons for 1 scrap metal, or even 1:1. Some of the newer ones can go for higher, but other traders sell them for lower to get more sales.

** Buy keys from the store, not weapons or hats**

With the exception of a few items(the jumpers, and some of the very rare hats), most of the time you get a better deal buying keys and selling them for metal. Buy keys, sell them for 2.3 or 2 refined each.

** Purely cosmetic does not mean low value, don't immediately sell off your first hat drop **

In fact, lots of cosmetic items are MUCH more valuable than weapons . Now, if you are not interested in cosmetics, break it down efficiently. Don't trade your Team Captain for a Razorback because you don't play Soldier, you could get lots more items for that. For normal hats, try to sell them for metal(price check first), then break down the metal and buy some weapons. I've heard of way too many people trading a hat they thought to be useless for a handful of weapons, when they could have earned a TON of weapon for it.

** Don't craft weapons, trade for them, and remember that crafting hats is a risky gamble **

Most crafting recipes call for at least 1 scrap metal and another weapon. You could buy the weapon for that 1 scrap metal. Also when you craft hats, you run the risk of getting shitty hats. Again, you can buy most hats for a low amount of metal, and not only do you save, you get more control.

EDIT: Hey look, /r/tf2trade has [hat craft stats](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/j6fq3/hat_crafting_statistics/)! According the OP's calculations, the average craft hat is worth 2.084 refined. That's less than the 3 ref to craft a hat together, but a little more than the 1 ref to buy craft hats in bulk(doesn't look like it's worth the effort tbh, I'm sure scrap banking + weapon sales earns and more faster without the risk).",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_j636f,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/j636f/some_tips_regarding_trading_crafting_and_buying/,

Pyro:  Yeah... I know. I just love spoiling spies days, airblasting rockets, and burrrrrrninating the villagers. I'm really disappointed that the detonator doesn't give a rocket-jump power, but I never used to use the flare gun and the explodeyness of the detonator has really added to the fun. 

Soldier: ROCKETS!!! I pretty much only use the Black Box, because I rarely get any medic love. Those 15 hp/hit really add up. I love the Soldier because of the rocket-jumping ability and the fact that the weapon shoots straight, instead of in a parabola, like the grenades and stickies of the Demoman. That said, I'm usually more successful playing Demoman, but he's not in my top 3 favorite.

Medic: HEAL ALL THE THINGS!!! Running around, making sure everyone's healthy, constantly dodging enemy fire, shooting syringes at spies, organizing pushes, and UBERING!!! I love being a medic, and it's particularly rewarding when you happen upon a server that is appreciative of your efforts, which is pretty much always. I could have the top score for my team as an engie (praise be to teleporting), a heavy, a demoman, a soldier, a pyro, or a spy, but the only time I ever get any love from my team is when I give a little healing. The game is called TEAM Fortress 2, and when you're Medic, you really get to see the benefits of good teamwork. 

I've got about a thousand hours under my belt, but I could sure as shit bet you that just about anyone could beat me any day of the week. That said, I love playing the game and these are my favorite classes for the moment. My favorites have changed over the years.

1. Regarding drops, are they all completely random? Is it random based off kills? Meaning will I only have a shot at getting something when I perform a kill or an assist? Or is it absolutely random and I could get one while holding still staring at someones tag.

2. So far I've been sticking with Medic so I'm at least somewhat helping my team. Any tips on how I can be a better healer? 

3. I want to start branching out to other classes and am wondering if there are any newbie friendly(-ier) ones? So far Medic seems decently easy, as well as Heavy. I also enjoy Engineer and don't find too much trouble with it since it is easy enough to know where to place things, especially in point defending maps. Anything I should keep in mind while playing these classes or jumping into others?

4. So far I've just been randomly selecting maps in the server list, I prefer objective based ones to just arena. I suppose I don't so much have a question, per se, as I'm just curious if there is anything I should keep an eye out for, such as number of players or possibly even newb-friendly servers?

5. I see versions of weapons with the word ""Vintage"" preceding them, does this have any effect on the stats of the weapon at all?

1262995587.0,14,self.NewToTF2,ancs9,Spy Tips (Sorted by topic),Shaleblade,17,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/ancs9/spy_tips_sorted_by_topic/,"**WEAPON CHOICE:**

* The [Ambassador](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Ambassador) looks cool, so you should use it, right? Wrong. The Ambassador makes a great weapon in certain situations (or if you're a CS:S god), but its poor rate of fire and lower base damage makes it a very poor emergency weapon. The [Revolver](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Revolver) makes a much better emergency weapon, as it has a high crit rate, good damage, fast reload, and a great fire rate. If you're still unsatisfied by the revolver's blandness, download some [skins here](http://www.fpsbanana.com/skincats/1903).

* If you have the [Cloak and Dagger](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Cloak_and_Dagger), use it over the standard [Invisibility Watch](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Invisibility_watch). It requires much more patience, but overall, it allows you to pick and choose your targets much easier instead of being thrown into hopefully-good situations.

* The [Dead Ringer](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Dead_Ringer) requires much more ""acting"" (*see further down the post for a section on acting*) than the other watches, but it is a great tool for getting behind enemy lines. Most people will begin to catch on after a while, so it's normally necessary to switch back to the Cloak and Dagger.

**WEAPON USAGE**

* Despite the Ambassador's lackings in being a quality getaway weapon, it makes up for it in other ways. If you have an occupied target (normally a Sniper or an Engineer), it allows you to bring them down while staying out of range of their sentries/teammates. It is a much more situational weapon than the Revolver.

* You're just about to backstab that lone Medic, and all of a sudden, he moves to the left, and you miss. You're left undisguised, and in great danger. His teammates could be ready to pop around the corner at a moment's notice! If you fail to stab your target, *do not continue to swipe at him*. Sure, you may be able to pull off a [facestab](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Facestab#Facestab), but you're very likely to die either way. Instead, take out your Revolver and retreat as you try to gun him down; the [Butterfly Knife](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Knife) and the Revolver have the same base damage. When you either kill the target or get out of their sight, [cloak](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Cloak) and run away.

**DISGUISING**

* If you're going to disguise, be sure to cloak before and after you do so. It will remove the smoke that eminates from an recently disguised Spy.

* Be sure to switch up your disguises. Your enemies will often catch on, and will be able to root you out much easier.

* Remember to change your weapons. Believe it or not, Eyelander Demos and Medics with their Mediguns out are much more believable disguises than not.

* When disguised, acting is required. If you're disguised as a Sniper, act like a Sniper. The most common mistakes seen by Spies who don't act are:

	1. Running the opposite way. If you see a friendly Pyro running away from the point directly at you, they're almost certainly a Spy.

	2. Looking at the enemy team. Try to keep the enemy in your sights without directly looking at them.

	3. Forgetting context. Don't disguise as a Scout defending the point. Be sure to act like a Sniper when you're on your local Sniper deck.

**INFILTRATION**

* The Dead Ringer is a great infiltration weapon; disguising as a teammate (I prefer Scout with his Bat out) and trying to see how far you can run past the enemy without them triggering your DR is effective, although you need to remember to redisguise after it's triggered.

* Spy suicide runs are rarely as helpful as well thought-out strategies. Try not to repeat the same tactic twice in a row. If you find yourself stuck in a situation, 

* With the Cloak and Dagger, you can stay infinitely invisible in one spot. This makes you a much better scout than the Scout itself. If you have a mic, **USE IT**. Sentry locations, Soldier/Demo/Heavy/Whatever+Medic combos, sticky traps, *anything*. No matter what your watch choice, you need to be sure to tell your team *everything* you see. This alone will take you from the level of ""Skillless nub"" to ""Invaluable recon"".

Now pyro is a pretty easy class to get into. 100% run speed, above average health, and a simple objective. I mean, all you do is run and set things on fire, right?

 **WRONG!!**

Pyro is a very versatile class well suited to both offensive and defensive roles. (S)he excels in ambush tactics, hiding around corners, sneaking up from behind, and keeping constant pressure on groups of enemies. The compression blast is an amazingly useful tool that anyone seeking to play pyro should train to use effectively. 

*Offense* 

* Your best bet is taking alternate routes to the objective area. These routes often contain many corners which are ideal for you to hide behind and set anyone else ablaze. They also frequently put you in a more desirable location by the objective, where there are less enemies in your way. 

* You are one of four key classes for a medic to give ubercharge to. Consistent, high damage output makes you a prime candidate for burning a sentry nest to ash. Coordinate with your medic to get a favorable starting position, as your flamethrower's short reach is a big weakness.

* Pay attention on the front lines for spies sneaking around. You're cursed with being obligated to spycheck EVERYONE, ALL THE TIME. While everyone on your team should spycheck, the pyro always gets blamed for a missed spy. Be wary of a dead ringer spy, if they're still on fire after you burned them, use your compression blast and keep them controlled. Your fire will do next to no damage while the dead ringer cloak is active, so juggle them until it wears off or pull out a shotgun and finish them off. Your team may try to help you out too, but you're the best suited for dealing with the spy. 

* Use your compression blast liberally. it's easy to pick up ammo on most maps, so don't worry about your reserves. It's an incredibly potent asset to the pyro. You can protect your medic from rockets and pipe/sticky bombs. You can clear the Control point of any class trying to block your capture. use it to keep a scout at bay or corner it and burn him to the ground. Put out your teammates with it. If they're burning, make it a priority to put out the fires. **ESPECIALLY YOUR MEDIC I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH FOR THE LOVE OF GAWD PUT OUT YOUR MEDIC IF IT MEANS KILLING YOURSELF** 

* A very potent tactic as pyro is to use your flamethrower and axetinguisher or postal pummeler. It will take down every class besides heavy in one hit. The Degreaser's faster weapon switch makes this a fluid motion. Adding a compression blast to control your victim's movement is also recommended. The stock flamethrower is your next best bet as the compression blast is  still only 20 ammo

* keep your opponent overwhelmed with your fire, distract them so the rest of your team can have an easier time of advancing

* If you're skulking around on your own, and no medic is on your team, consider the Back Scratcher as a melee. the extra health from medpacks makes a difference in survivability. However, if your team has no medic, a better option is to go medic instead. 

*Defense*

* Hold off narrow choke points, hide behind corners and use your air blast to cease enemy advancement. 

* stick with the engineer and his buildings, burning everywhere to fish out spies. Use your airblast to push away rockets and bombs aiming for the engie's buildings. 

* The Homewrecker/maul or the Neon Annihilator remove sappers from friendly buildings. once you've dealt with the spy, but he got your engie, use them to keep the buildings alive. 

* constantly put out teammates that get set on fire. you're a big help in keeping them alive when behind the lines.
 
* If you see the enemy has a teleporter, try to sniff out where it is, then alert your team or try to take it out yourself. 



**For secondary weapons**

* the stock shotgun is my personal choice. you can hit enemies underwater, or those just outside your flamethrower's reach. Also is great for fighting another pyro. While they're chasing you with their flamethrower, you'll just be leisurely strolling backwards picking them off with your shotgun. 

* The flare gun is the next best option, it does guaranteed crits (which equates to 90 HP) against burning foes. this means you can pick off burning scouts, snipers, spies, engineers, or medics with relative ease. However, it takes a trained eye and hand to aim the flare gun, and the reload time leaves you vulnerable to attack. 

* The reserve shooter is another choice of shotgun. In my experience, the decrease in weapon switch time in negligible when you have the degreaser, however, it makes an effective combo with it. the minicrits on airborne targets mean the compression blast sends them up, your reserve shooter brings them down. make sure you're a good shot, though, you only have 3 per clip. this is why I prefer the stock shotgun, six shots mean you'll take down an enemy pyro faster as well. 

* The manmelter shouldn't be used much. the reload is slower than the flare gun, and you can already put allies out with a compression blast.

* The Detonator is similar to the flare gun, but only deals mini crits (45 damage) on burning targets. it's best known for giving the pyro the ability to ""flare jump"" but aiming at the ground and jumping for a height boost at the cost of some health. however, the jump height and distance are minimal, and very situational. You're best off with the flare gun if you want to use it. 

* The scorch shot is similar to the detonator, but deals no extra damage to burning foes. instead, it ignites foes in a small radius around the target. it also gives an ability to flare jump, but costs more health at no extra height or distance. pick the detonator if you want to flare jump. 


I'll continue with primary and melee in a different post at a later date. I need to wrap it up here for now though. I think I covered the basics and the important stuff.

NewtoTF2 has been a community for new players to become better acquainted with the game. New players have come to us for advice and discussion around the game, and our veterans have given them just that.  Often, veterans lose track of those they help.

*Now is your chance to show us what you've learned.*

If you're a new player, or were once a new player seeking advice from /R/NewtoTF2, you can win ~~2~~ 10 keys.

[What you can do with 2 keys.](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2trade/comments/pr9zw/questionpoll_what_could_you_buy_with_2_keys/)

This is all you need to enter this contest:

* **A link to a video you created**, demonstrating something you learned from NewtoTF2.  This video needs to have been created after 8:00 PM Eastern 2/15/2012(Today).    It needs to be here **before March 5th**.

* **A link to the relevant post that you learned it from.**  This can be a comment, another's question, a random musing, a guide, or any other resources you found on NewtoTF2.


All entries will be judged on the following:

* **Editing and Clarity of video.**  Quality doesn't need to be great, but we need to be able to see what it is that you're demonstrating.

* **Execution of what you've learned.**  You have a lot of time to get it just right for the camera.

* **Community Acceptance.**  If the community looks favorably on your submission, so will I.  I will count only upvotes, downvotes will be disregarded, and comments on your submissions will be taken into consideration.  This is a slightly lower priority than the other two above.  A query for votes will be done separate to your submissions here, so  *when* you post your submission isn't as important as the quality.


Minor bonus points:

* **Linking us to your first/oldest posts on NewtoTF2.**

* **Demonstrating what you've learned on a live server**, and providing the server connection details

* **Demonstrating what you've learned in a competitive atmosphere**, including your team's name(if applicable), your league and/or division(s).

* **Music, or your personal voice commentary.**  Drop a phat beat, or articulate on the methods to your madness.  

* **Name drop NewtoTF2** in your video without hosting(IE: Youtube) based annotations.

Things that will *NOT* be taken into consideration.

* **Special effects.**  They're cool, but don't expect it to be a redeeming/qualifying factor.  If you feel artistically inclined, and you have the time, by all means.  It may win community favor, but I will find your expertise with movie editing software largely unimpressive.

* **Killing sprees.**  A 15 second clip demonstrating a mastery of reflect-jumping as a pyro is significantly more impressive than that time you got 100 kills in 3 minuets against a poorly organized team.  If you actually demonstrate something, great, but random frag videos without showing what you've learned doesn't help.

I'm a fairly new tf2 (this game rocks) player with barely 20 hours played in soldier class. I've been practicing rocket jumping after seeing all those cool videos where people can just fly through the air like a bird. I can do the basic look straight at your feet and fire rocket jump but I can't seem to do the sideways rocket jumping even though I've been practicing for hours and watching tons of tutorials about it :( 

When attempting to do flick rocket jump, I press W, look to the right and then press jump/crouch/fire/release W/press A (all the same time) and then press W when I'm in air but it fails after moving a short distance in front. 

Am I doing the motions wrong ?
Is there any specific angle and location that I have to aim ? 

I also have the flip viewmodel setting on (left handed).

Edit : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzGpDvwpgpQ&amp;feature=g-upl&amp;context=G2761f26AUAAAAAAAAAA

For anyone interested, this is a video of me failing rocket jumping but I think I managed to get a few jumps in. Quality's horrible and no sound though. Any tips to improve would be much appreciated :) The video is extremely boring and frustrating for me to watch :( 

Edit : I listened to the tips from everyone and tried again. I'm still messing up most of the jumps. Here is the .dem file if anyone would like to watch it. Ignore the last few minutes :C My fingers were getting tired pressing the buttons :/

http://www.4shared.com/file/P7W8eyGW/4_online.html?

To put this in perspective, I am an older (mid 40's) F2P noob TF2 player. I'm not really much of a gamer in general but I picked up TF2 for free and found that I quite enjoy it. My general motivation is just to let off a bit of steam after work for a bit of fun.

I know I am a bit crap and I have read just about every guide I can find, but what I really need more than anything is practice. What i am concerned about is that I don't want to piss anyone off while I am learning.

Generally speaking I like to play either heavy or medic and I have about 4 hours on each class. I seem to prefer payload games mainly because it's harder to get lost on the payload maps. I think heavy suits me best because I can bludgeon my way along the tracks without requiring too much finesse. If there are a load of heavies and no medics though I am happy to be a medic. So here are my questions:

Are there any servers I should avoid? i don't mind the fact that I will get beaten to a pulp sometimes but I don't want to piss other people off by being crap.

As a heavy, is it OK to camp next to a dispenser and blast anything that moves keeping my ammo and health constantly topped up? Is this depriving other people from using it?

As a medic, is it OK to hang back a bit from the front line (or at least get into cover) and expect people to drop back a bit when they need healing? I know this doesn't apply when I am deploying uber, but in general is it OK to look after my own safety as a priority?

If someone is yelling ""medic"" when they are close to full health is it OK to ignore them while other people need healing? It seems to be mainly heavies that do this and I am happy to pocket a heavy when they are pushing forward and there are no other players on low health.

Is there anything else I should consider?

Cheers.

I have had a level three teleporter, level one dispenser, and level three sentry up before the gate even opens on most maps (thanks to some competent engineer teaming). However a spy will manage to sneak in and take me out. Or an uber backed by soldiers will damage it faster than I can keep my gun alive. This usually ends in my team screaming ""z0mg wears da turrets brah'!?"" Blown up, that's where. This scenario can become few and far between with just a little bit of team work.

I have played TF2 on and off (more on than off) since the beta. I am in no means an amazing TF2 player. I would consider myself only above average. However I have picked up on enough about pubbing to understand the key points that usually determine an easy defense. The pyro/engineer duo is one of them, let's look at why this is.

The engineer has great firepower, can use teleporters to essentially make respawn times far shorter, and builds dispenser to keep teammates in the fight longer. However it is very susceptible to competent spies, good ubers, and average demoman.

The pyro can roast spies, the dispenser means he can simply spam his flame thrower and usually kill the spy before he even gets a chance to back stab the engineer. In the case where the spy does make it through, once dead the pyro can use the homewrecker and remove the sapper in one hit. This can potentially save the sentry. In case of ubers the pyro has a few options. He can reflect rockets away of course. However in many cases the uber will be quite close and I have found it very effective to actually compression blast the uber away. This makes it harder for the target of the uber to aim, or if only the medic is targeted for the blast, you can simply cut off the uber. When demomen start tossing those stickies on the sentry it is no problem, simply push them away with a nice blast of compressed air. Pipe bombs landing at the engineers feet about to kill him? Hit them with some air and watch as they turn a different color and harmlessly explode. Soldier are also fun to play with, have a soldier wasting your engineers metal? Blast those rockets back and watch as he rages!

As you can see the pyro and engineer are a match made in heaven. They go together like beer and pizza or whatever cliched analogy you wish to use. I hope some new player will take note of this and the next time you see an engineer on your team with no one to help him, go pyro and be his body guard. I play engineer quite a lot in pubs and will still switch to pyro to protect a fellow engineer.

If you ever see me in a game and want to try it out, just shout out to me and I will gladly go pyro and help you out.",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_j6kuh,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/j6kuh/engineer_and_pyro_best_friends_forever/,

I recommend that you begin playing primarily on payload maps as you learn the game.  (Payload maps have a pl_ prefix, like pl\_badwater and pl\_frontier.)  Payload maps make good ""beginner"" maps because they are highly linear in nature and the game makes your objectives very simple.  If you are blue, you stand next to the cart.  If you are red, you shoot at the blue guys who are standing next to the cart.  It's also hard to get lost on a payload map, and if you're ever unsure of which direction to head to get to the action, just follow the train tracks.

#After you've got the basics down, stay away from ctf\_2fort.  Technically, it's a capture the flag map, but most people tend to treat it like a free-for-all deathmatch, and you seldom see any actual teamwork on these maps.  ctf_2fort is an okay map for learning the fundamentals of how your class's mechanics work, but once you've had an hour or so to figure things out, move onto payload maps.

-------

Certain classes tend to be more  than others. The most versatile are medic, soldier, and demoman; I'd recommend learning at least one of these ASAP since it will be useful no matter what map you're playing on. Medic and soldier also have relatively forgiving learning curves. The scout tends to be hit or miss: he's great on symmetrical maps, bad on asymmetrical ones, and he's a bit more difficult to get good with. The rest of the classes are all somewhat situational and you can try them to see if you like them but you don't need to make learning them a priority if you don't particularly enjoy playing them.  Besides those mentioned, the heavy is pretty easy to pick up and play, and he's arguably borderline OP (he's gotten some mad buffs in the past several months; there's a good chance some of them may get rolled back in the near future).  Heavy is one of the easier classes to top the scoreboard with, but you make more enemies than friends by playing him.

I'd recommend avoiding servers with more than 24 players. Beyond that point, games get to be heavily choked with spam. Also, lower-end machines suffer massive FPS drops above the 24-player mark. I prefer to play on servers with fewer than 20 players, but 24-player servers are decent if you are starting out.  Generally, servers with higher player counts tend to be more forgiving of newer players; in a large game it's easier to get lost in the crowd, and no one will get mad at you for not pulling your weight if you have ten teammates to carry you.

#If you have a mic, use it. Communication will improve your performance drastically.

-------

Every so often, you'll get a random item drop.  [The drop system is explained in greater detail here.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Drop)  If you are a new player, chances are that a significant portion of your weapons will come through random drop.

In addition, each class has around 35 achievements specific to that class, and there ""milestones"" for unlocking 5, 10, and 15 achievements (or 10, 15, and 20 achievements in some cases).  Each of these milestones is tied to a specific weapon, so each class has three weapons that can be obtained via achievement.  (Some classes have more than three weapons; the other weapons must be obtained via random drop or crafting, see below.)  If you want to find out whether a certain unlockable weapon is available via achievements, and how many achievements are required to unlock it, you can look it up on [the official TF2 wiki](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Main_Page).

As an alternative to achievements or waiting for random drop specific weapons can be crafted if you have extra duplicate weapons.  [This is explained here.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Crafting)  Non-achievement weapons each have a specific recipe that will generate that specific item 100% of the time if you have the right ingredients.  Every weapon in the game can be crafted using the ""generic"" recipe that uses two tokens and a scrap metal, but most of these recipes can potentially yield multiple weapons so it's a less-than-ideal way to fill your backpack, especially since you need to smelt 8 duplicate weapons to make the tokens and scrap.

The ideal way to obtain weapons is via random drop, since this requires zero effort on your part, but it's something that you have no control over.  If you don't want to wait for something via random drop, the next recommended course of action is either achievement (if applicable) or unique recipe (if not applicable).  Generic recipes should be a last ditch effort to obtain something that you cannot feasibly obtain via achievement or lack the ingredients to craft via unique recipe.

#Once you've obtained all of the weapons that are relevant to your interests, you can instead use your extra weapons to craft scrap metal which can be formed into hats.  Hats are purely cosmetic and serve no function other than to look pretty, but they are highly prized due to their rarity.  Hats can be obtained by random drop (not sure of the exact drop rate but it's pretty darn low), or by crafting.  If you want to craft a random hat, you will need a total of 54 extra weapons.  Alternatively, there is a crafting recipe that gives you a bit of control over the outcome of crafting a hat by allowing you to choose the class that it is for, this recipe requires a grand total of 75 extra weapons.

-------

I recommend learning soldier very early on for a number of reasons.  The soldier's skill curve is relatively forgiving, but he also has an absurdly high skill ceiling, meaning that he's a great class no matter what level of play you're at.  Even a soldier that's not hitting anything is still useful for providing covering fire and soaking up damage (soldier has the second-highest HP in the game).  You will *never* run into a situation where you have ""too many"" soldiers; he's incredibly versatile and he'll always be of some benefit to his team even if you're not so great at using him.  Here are some learning resources, specific to the soldier:

[How to play the soldier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI29xEnfTzI)

[How to rocket jump, by Jaeger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN99Al_rRnI) (might be a bit too much information but it is certainly comprehensive)

#[Soldier jumps for Badlands and Granary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN2LQbvcN_Y) (these are map-specific but incredibly helpful for those two maps, which happen to be the two most popular maps where rocket jumping at the start of the round is tremendously important due to the lack of setup gates.  Also, many of the principles can be applied to other maps as well, particularly those used on Granary.)

-------

Here's my list of ""must have"" weapons that you're going to want to get ASAP if they're for one of the classes that you play:

* Equalizer
* Axtinguisher
* Degreaser
* Sandvich
* GRU

#There are lots of other weapons you can obtain that are quite useful (I've grown quite fond of the bushwacka+jarate combo myself) so feel free to experiment with weapons as you find them.  Nearly every weapon can be viable under the right circumstances, so I like to keep one of every weapon in my backpack on the off-chance that I need it.  The weapons listed above are the ones that really stick out as being superior to their vanilla counterparts in nearly all situations, but I'd recommend that you aim to eventually acquire all of the weapons for the classes that you play.  You don't have to actively seek them out; just make sure you're not crafting them away for metal.

-------

Be sure to check out the ""advanced"" settings under the ""multiplayer"" tab of the ""options"" menu.  You may wish to experiment with some of these and enable them at your discretion.  The main two options that I recommend changing from their defaults are ""display damage done as text over your target"" and ""automatically reload weapons when you're not firing.""  The damage display is especially helpful when you're starting out and are learning how much damage each weapon does from what ranges.  There's really no reason not to use auto-reload, since you can interrupt reloads while firing and having it set to automatic just gives you one less thing to worry about.

While you're under options, go under the ""video"" tab and check the ""advanced"" settings.  There should be an option called ""Field of view"" with a slider.  Drag that slider all the way to the right. Doing this will increase your  FOV from 75 to 90 and allow you to see more (and die less as a result).",,False,,t5_2rbtk,True,,,True,t3_edrkx,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/edrkx/an_introductory_guide_to_tf2_for_everyone_who/,

Apparently, I can't behave like the other classes since I get killed while disguised quite often. Which brings me to the next question: What class to disguise as?

1. **Scout**: Too fast, I disguise as it, don't run fast, get caught.
2. **Soldier**: If people don't see me shoot at enemies quite often, they'll get suspicious, since that's what the soldier is supposed to do.
3. **Pyro**: Again, same as Soldier, if I am not constantly firing at people people will get suspicious.
4. **Demoman**: He should be constantly throwing his sticky bombs everywhere.
5. **Heavy**: Spam clicking to everyone.
6. **Engineer**: Engineers don't get to the action, they stay somewhere doing their sentries shenanigans.
7. **Medic**: Should be healing everyone.
8. **Sniper**: Now this one is the one that so far has proved to me that it is the best, although I was told that disguising too often as the same class isn't good. It also depends on the maps I am playing on.
9. **Spy**: You can become invisible, but if the team doesn't see your silhouette, they might think I am not exactly a spy from their team.

Analog sticks are very comfortable for me to work with, and so I've kept in my comfort zone. However, I'm having a few hitches:

I find that as a Sniper, the low sensitivity I play on in order to have a good control over my aim as classes like Scout and Heavy absolutely cripples my inability to do much more than get the reticle at eye-level and strafe (like on 2-Fort). Is this a popular issue when playing with a mouse, or is it not worth gritting my teeth and developing the muscle memory if I could just improve on the controller?

As a Spy, again because of the low sensitivity, I have problems doing the immediate turn-around backstab that one does when they pass an enemy in a corridor while disguised (It would be great if they had a button like they do in L4D that does a 180 for you...). However, that negative is far traded-off, I think by how much easier it is to maneuver through the inventory on the D-Pad of the controller. Disguising, switching to sapper, sapping the sentry, switching to the knife, missing the backstab, backing up and whipping out the revolver is a task that's accomplished with little hitch in my ability to move, and more importantly, without the HUD showing me which num key I pressed for my inventory, and without having to go through the scroll wheel of my mouse to go past the sapper to get from the knife to my revolver. I guess the question I wanted to ask for this part, is if there was a better mapping I could be using that might help alleviate the frustration of navigating a loaded item set? Because I have the same issue with the Engie, too...

I play a good deal of League of Legends, so I thought that my mouse skills would transfer over, but unfortunately, adding the 3rd dimension damn near gives me vertigo when I try to maneuver in a panic (like a pyro rush, etc) when combined with moving around using the alien feel of WASD.

Truth be told, I'm not entirely certain what I'm looking for in posting this-- I'm just frustrated that I can't enjoy the game like I know I could if either I were comfortable with the mouse, or if the controller option was better tuned (specifically in the case of you standard aim VS the aim you've got as a sniper) as I've gotten accustomed to in other shooters on consoles.

Thanks, guys.

**TL;DR:** I use a controller. Share you experiences. Then the following questions apply with or without the mouse: Snipers, how do you get good at aiming? Spy players, how do you map your keys?",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_14rz4t,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/14rz4t/i_play_using_a_controller/,

Is there an ideal team comp? For example, if you have a team of 10, what's the minimum number of medics? All else being equal, a team with a medic should win over a team with no medics, right? 

2. Matchmaking. Does the matchmaking take an individual's skill into account at all? It seems like the only criteria matchmaking searches for are the servers. Are there servers where you would only be matched up against other beginners? 

3. People leaving and new people entering. Coming from a dota/lol background this is very perplexing. Do people really not have an obligation to see the game through to the end? I guess you're less reliant on your teammates to do well overall, but it's still really jarring. 

4. Choosing maps. Matchmaking doesn't seem to ask which map I want to play on. It will give me the choice of game mode, for example KotH or CTF, but not whether I want to play on dustbowl or some other map. Why is that? I was even put into a custom map this morning. Is there no way to play on the official maps only?

4. Imbalanced teams. When one team has 2 more players than the other team, the matchmaking automatically takes one player and moves him. But what about when there's only 1 extra player to one side? Are any measures taken like increasing respawn times to the side with the extra player, or is the imbalance taken as a normal part of the game?",,False,,t5_2rbtk,False,,,True,t3_11nhrs,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/11nhrs/new_to_tf2_a_couple_of_questions/,

I need to clean make some room in my backpack. I figured I could free up some slots by giving away the weapons I have doubles (and triples) of.

I'll only be giving 1-2 away to each person. There aren't really any criteria you have to meet (meaning I'll start off with some but quickly become lazy and just start ctrl-F, hit enter a few times, and hand them out) to get the weapon(s) you want. Just post a comment with what you want. Make sure your comment is a new comment, and not in reply to another comment, or I might not see it.

There is, however, a requirement for the Strange Rainblower. You have to link me to your backpack. (Must be viewable, not private.) I'll make a raffle out of the eligible people sometime near the end of the giveaway.

Alright, I have been playing Team Fortress 2 for about 11 months now, I have a above average grip on Trading, In Game terms, Comp, ect.

I am 12 years and I have found my spot in the Medic, which, unfortunately, needs a ton of mic work. Don't get me wrong, I do not yell, complain, scream, ask dumb questions, I know most of the terms (lit, pick, Pootis, buds, pocket ect.) I just need to get around ths voice and mic thing hurdle. Not to show off, but I think I am a bit morr mature than most 12 year olds. For one, I don't mind helping new players, I don't have a common predijuce against most people.

I understand why people hate 12 year olds and generally kids online. I myself have a low tolerance for kids, especially if they scream, shout, yell or complain about things. I have yet to meet another young player with maturity and skill of an above average player. 

I asked spuf the other day and I got laughs, and trolls and jokes. So im asking newtotf2. Help me with this, its a big hurdle for me. I asked ths subreddit because from what i have seen, newtotf2 has 90% mature players willing to help others with a problem.

I'm working on overall team strategy plans that can be used like football plays. So all the players have to do is say, ""Let's do the Double Engie Scout Blitz"" and everyone knows what it is and can implement the strategy easily and efficiently.

I have written one up for CTF games as an example. If there isn't already a list of plays like this listed elsewhere and players find it useful, I'll make more.



**Double Engie Scout Blitz**


Phase One


Defensive Group Objective: 

Protect the Engineers while they are building so they can be self-sufficient in defending the intel. 


Offensive Group Objective: 

The Scouts will blitz the Enemy and take the Intel as much as possible before they can erect their own defenses.



Defensive Group:

2 Engineers

1-2 Pyros

1-2 Demos, Heavies, or Soldiers


Offensive Group:

3+ Scouts


Defensive Group Duties:

Engineers: Do *not* use the Gunslinger. Immediately run to your Intel Room and build Sentries *inside* the intel room as fast as possible. Upgrade to level three as fast as possible. Then build Dispensers and upgrade to level three as fast as possible. (You can build outside the Intel Room but make sure *all* routes are covered. For example, on Doublecross, Scouts, Demos, and Soldiers can come in and leave via the yard behind the Intel Room. Make sure it is covered.)

Pyros: Spy check and defend the buildings as the Engineers run to get more metal. Don't take metal they can  use. Conserve ammo until they get their dispensers up.

Demo, Heavy, or Soldier: Spy check and be ready to defend the buildings and intel.


Offensive Group Duties:

Scouts: Go get the Enemy Intel as fast as possible before the enemy engies have their sentries up. If the enemy never sets up sentries or there are holes in their defenses where you will not be shot down by sentries, just keep taking the intel until you win. In this case, there will be no need for Phase Two and you will win shortly.


Phase Two:

Offensive Group Objective: 

Dismantle and destroy the Enemy Engineer positions so that the Intel can be recovered. Ignore any enemy offensive players and let them pass; your Defensive Group should be able to handle them.

Defensive Group Objective:

Guard the Intel and prevent sentries and other buildings from being destroyed.


Defensive Group:

2 Engineers

1 Pyro

Offensive Group:

1-2 Pyros

1-2 Heavies

1-2 Medics

1-2 Demos

1-2 Scouts

1-2 Soldiers

1-2 Snipers

1-2 Spies

Defensive Group Duties:

Engineers: These are the same two Engineers from Phase One. Guard the Intel.

Pyro: Guard the Engineers and their buildings and the Intel. Spycheck and use the Homewrecker to unsap sentries. 

Offensive Group Duties:

Pyros: Escort the Offensive Group into the enemy base. Sweep the area around the advancing team to kill spies. Keep the enemy at a distance.

Scouts: Harrass the enemy and escort the slower moving Heavies, Soldiers, and Demos as they advance. Take out Spies and call attention away from the ""Big Guns"" in your group. Lure Enemy Pyros away from the team. When the Offensive Group gets into the Intel Room and all defenses are down, grab the Intel and run home as fast as you can.

Snipers: Stay back and focus on taking out any enemies harrassing the advancing Offensive Group.

Spies: Harass the engineer positions. If possible, sap and neutralize enemy engineer positions just as the main group is entering an area.

Heavy, Demo, Soldiers, Medics: Advance as a group but don't get too clustered to avoid group splash and fire damage. Focus on destroying sentries and getting to the Intel Room. Destroy all defenses and if there are no Scouts available, grab the Intel and run home.

Repeat Phase Two until victory is achieved.

It's been incredibly helpful. I made the switch to keyboard/mouse from the sticks about a year ago. TF2 is the first and only FPS I've played on PC. I've logged @270 hours and have the following advice for new players:

* **TF2 is a team game**. Put everything you do in this context. If you are kredit to team, you contribute to everyone's enjoyment. If you are not kredit to team, you do not contribute to everyone's enjoyment. The best part of TF2 for new players is that you can be a kredit to team without scoring a single point. See next point...
* Talk! Lets say you run around a corner and get blown up by a level three sentry. Fail? No! You have successfully gathered intelligence. Tell your team there is a sentry around the corner. We don't care if you say ""Gun thingy with rockets."" Just let everyone know whats there. You are a huge kredit to team if you do this kind of thing.
* If you talk, you'll find people you like playing with. Add these people to your friends list and seek them out. We will add you even if you are terrible, as long as you are kredit to team (see above). You will have fun if you're playing with friends.
* Get ye to youtube, search ""how to play (class)"". Be mindful and intentionally practice the techniques discussed in videos.
* For the love of god, please read all the posts about not having three snipers/spies on a team. Even a second spy/sniper is not a kredit to team*. (*typically)
* Be patient if you are moving to PC from console. Keyboard/Mouse was very awkward at first but after a few hours I was able to run down hallways without bumping into everything. Pyro and Medic were great first classes due to my lack of aiming ability, although I generally stuck to Pyro as I had no idea what was going on with gameplay. This worked out well, as I generally want to burn things by the time I start playing. I was not kredit to team with my gameplay, but I got used to it. I'm at 270ish now and could probably play scout if I actually practiced with him every once in a while.
* Around 40 hours I had enough understanding to start playing engie. #1 advice - make sure your tele exits don't face a wall. You might be kredit to team, but they'll curse you with every transport. Right-click to turn buildings before placing them. 
* After accidentally killing someone with a shotgun as engie, I decided to try my hand at shooting people with the shotgun on purpose. It totally worked! Do this!
* If you haven't played an FPS before, remember the #1 rule of the FPS genre. KEEP MOVING.

1. DO NOT DIE.  Avoid dying all the time.  never go on suicide runs unless you have an uber ready and that uber run is absolutely necessary.
2. If you are about to die, uber yourself even if you´re not charging anyone.  This will at least save you the respawn time and run back.
3. HEAL EVERYONE that is hurt.  Uber charges faster this way.  A great way to do this is stand behind a corner and heal everyone that is shooting around that corner.  Overcharging only a heavy is pretty much useless to charge your uber when you can overcharge at least 5 or 6 people at the same time if they´re not under fire.
4. Collaborate with other medics with your mic.  3 ubers at the same time are a sure way to move the firing line in the right direction.
5. Never underestimate damage pyros cause on sentries.  An ubered pyro is fast enough to run through sentry fire and destroy engineer pits.  Ubering a heavy to do the same job may not get anything done since engineers can safely hide and repair under gunfire.
6. Please don´t be a battle medic.  They´re pretty much useless.

Seems any time I bump someone, even if it's just a slight tap, someone, somewhere, saw me do it and I die in 2 seconds.  Didn't used to be like that. 

Also did they buff pyros against spies?  Seems that the flamethrower kills me in about 1 second now a days.  

Additionally, did they crank up the decloaking sound?  It's hard for me to gauge on my end but I've noticed that if you decloak within about 20 feet of someone, they're going to hear it.  Just how loud is it now a days?  Used to be pretty silent.  

Also did they decrease the time length that the cloak runs?  Seems pretty short now a days but my timing may just be off.  Find myself having to use the cloak and dagger to get anywhere.  I really dislike that thing but I can no longer seem to get to the enemy teleporters without having to sit around for a while, and if I'm moving around trying to find metal, someone's gonna shoot me.  Pyros seem to have a Predator-esque sense for spies now.

Oh and this is just a general question but I can't seem to find an answer to it:  as far as the dead ringer goes, is that just a one shot thing or what?  Because I'll use it, get shot, move, decloak, and then try and use it again and it won't come up, even with a full cloak bar.  Do I have to get 'another one' from a dispenser/ammo drop or something?

And one more thing:  is it possible to do quick stabs any more or are you completely limited by the back stab animation?  Has a huuuuuge delay in it at the end that makes chaining difficult.  

And I guess just a general request for tips.  Been hunting around the net for updated/new spying techniques but all the youtube videos seem to be from around the time I stopped playing.

I also find that because of it's simplicity, you really need to have an organized team to push and cap all 5 points.

I stopped playing FPS games (or gaming at all) a little over 7 years ago after just starting University.  I have quite a lot of free time now after getting a job that's quite unpredictable on my hours.

I was heavily into cpm and then also warsow up until when I stopped playing.  Both of those games' regular communities appear to have died, along with me being a little late to the game for QL.  So I decided to pick up tf2 as it seems fun and I've been impressed by quite a few of the videos I see popping up on youtube now and then.

I decided that I'd spend some time just optimising my setup first, I have a relatively strange keyboard layout and I know that tf2 is quite mature as far as an FPS goes so there are plenty of standard huds / configs / rules / fps guides out there that I should take advantage of.

In the end I've selected: 

* [yA_HUD](http://whayay.github.io/yA_HUD/)
* [Chris FPS](http://chrisdown.name/tf2/tf2configs-final.zip)
* My own custom CFGs for xhairs and the like

So I guess my first question is: *is this a reasonable setup? is there anything I've missed or bad things about the options I've chosen?*

Secondly, and I guess more importantly, I'm looking for people to play with.  I'm situated in Europe (the UK to be precise) and am pretty happy to just listen and get along with playing and getting better, I'm a relatively fast study but I realise I have absolutely tonnes to learn as I've barely played even a few hours.  I'd like it if the games were semi-organised, I find it easier to refine my understand of *what-the-fuck-is-going-on* if I'm playing in a standard format so if there's anything like that for people that aren't good that people could point me to I'd appreciate it!

Thanks all.

1) Are there official servers people play on? Are those the ones I should start off on? When I click Play Multiplayer in the menu will it just find me a server and toss me on to it or let me pick?

2) I still am not entirely sure what class I like best. I really liked the heavy in offline mode but I have typically liked support roles in other games. The medic seems cool but I die a hell of a lot and I see people complaining about medics only healing heavy. Do people run to the medic or expect the medic to run across the field looking for them? 

3) The spy seems interesting and I liked the sniper of course. In TF2 are there classes that are more desire than others? it seems like there is a lot of balance at least.

4) Does gear have any real affect? I see that some add bonuses, for example the Natascha adds a chance to slow target at the cost of a slow spin up time and a damage hit. Am I overly crippled if I use the standard stuff?

5) Also in regards to gear I see some are specified with a level. Again, the Natascha says it's a level 5 Minigun. Does that mean I need to be a certain level? Or what does that level indicate?

6) For MvM, is this essentially a PVE encounter? Is it generally only for experienced people? Is the only difference between Mann Up and Boot Camp playing on official servers as opposed to private ones?

7) Finally, I'm going to suck. I am pretty sure of it especially as I get used to the game. Is there a place I should be playing so that I am not going to really hear about it as much? :-P

Give us your best 1v1 class tips and help.

Knowing how to deal with players in a 1v1 scenario helps your overall understanding of the game, and will definitely help you in the situation where you're a roamer vs another roamer.



I'll start us off. 

Sniper vs Pyro

Sniper Rifle:  If at a range and the pyro is pelting you with shotgun bullets or flares, unscope and dodge the attack, then quickly scope back in over the pyro and take a shot.  Uncharged body shots will deal about 50 damage, and can discourage players from drawing your attention.  A uncharged headshot will deal 150 damage, and leaves the pyro very vulnerable at 25 health.   If you are hit with a flare from a distance, run.  A second flare *will* kill you.


SMG: Back pedal and unload your SMG into the pyro.  If he tries to avoid the fire, keep tracking him and keep firing.  Your SMG is surprisingly effective at medium range, and can very easily add up to 175 damage needed to kill the pyro.

Jarate + Bushwhacka:  A risky trick is to draw a pyro around a corner.  Time your jarate throw and soak him before he rounds it.  Swap to your Bushwhacka and quickly hit him with it.  If you can connect a melee hit while he's jarate'd, it will kill him.  This can be a gamble, but if you prefer the Bushwhacka/Jarate combo over the SMG, it's one of the few ways to deal with a pyro that's managed to get close.

1. The max drops you can get per week is between 8 and 10. Let's call it 9.      

2. Absolute worst case scenario you can sell 2 weapons to a scrap banker for 1 scrap.      

So easy math says 9 x 4 / 2 = 18 scrap, per month. That's 2 refined metal per month. Works out to $2 per month? That is assuming you only get weapons.     

What I want to know is, what is the ""real"" value of a drop, because it's not always just weapons right, you can get crates and hats and stuff. I know crates are like 7-9 per scrap, is that right? That would lower the expected value of the drop. But hats are worth more than weapons right? So that would raise the value of each drop.

**Heavy**

Is it worth it to carry the shotgun rather than the sandvich or dahloks?  It seems like the shotgun wouldn't be any better than the minigun in any situation I can think of beyond times where you want to be mobile.

**Pyro**

Seems pretty obvious here, having a shotgun allows you to engage targets that are out of range of your flamethrower.  Is this better than the Flare Gun though?  Seems that gun hits harder if you're accurate, and also has the fire effect.

**Soldier**

This is my real confusion.  When does it make sense to use the Shotgun as Soldier?  It seems to me the only logical reason to use it is if you run out of rockets and you still need to finish someone off, or to hit scouts.  The alternatives aren't that great, so I think it's what should go in that slot, but I don't know when to use it.

**Engineer**

I use Frontier Justice here, but I'd assume shotgun would fit the same purpose.

I decided to try out Team Fortress 2 since so many of my friends played it, one of which plays medic competitively.

I've lurked the r/tf2 subreddit for a couple months with interest in playing it eventually, but I didn't learn that much (other than how people chill after death). I read the official wiki for a while and the strategy there which helped a lot.

I did the tutorial and trained by myself for a little while before hopping on my first public server, playing payload. One thing I've really disliked about playing there is that people often don't play to win but play classes for fun. Which, I guess, is their right but it's frustrating when there's four snipers or three heavies with no medics.

On that subject, I **love** playing medic and it's taken up most of my playtime. I always feel like I'm contributing to the team and with a good pyro by our side (frakking spies) it's usually fun. Also, there's no feeling like ubersaw'ing a disguised spy to death and then getting another thirty seconds later.

I'm looking to try out other classes especially since my friend (the competitive medic) gave me quite a few items for the classes I've enjoyed the most so far. [Here's my backpack.](http://i.imgur.com/bvhRs.png)

The passed few nights i was called out for doing something stupid a few times, i don't even know what it was, but its depressing to hear sometimes. some of my troubles are I still have a little trouble targeting in very hectic situations, and I'm learning to stay alive longer, so I'm constantly trying different things, moving a lot, and trying to target those in need first. if that makes me terrible, so be it.

anyway, I'm in a game of payload last night(7-11-11), and the game just clicked, i was healing everything in sight, and helping hold our point effectively, i stayed alive for a long ass time as well. At one point i got stuck in a corner when my heavy got blown to bits by a blue heavy / medic combo. i was on a rocky incline around a corner, they didnt see me, i charged, i jumped, turned mid air, switched to my needle gun, got perfect aim on the blue medic, killed him in mid air, landed, and ran behind a rock, I LIVED

 i ran a few steps, then got blown to bits by a demo, but, man, what a feeling that was. i feel like i'm finally learning the game now, changing weapons effectively at the right times, and sort of in a groove. good times. nothing really productive here, just a good feeling after having fun in game!

I've decided to make a compendium post so people can be linked here the next time someone asks about it.

#What is premium? Am I premium?

The premium accounts of TF2 have non-gameplay-effecting bonuses involving the in-game item system.

* Premium players have 300 slot backpacks (free players have 50)
* Premium players can find cosmetic items (free players can find weapons, crates and tools)
* Premium players can trade items they have found (free players may only trade items given to them by others
* And, premium players can craft cosmetic items (free players can only craft metal and weapons)

The ways of becoming a premium member are:
* Activating a retail copy of TF2 (this will also give you the Proof of Purchase hat)
* Purchasing something from the Mann Co. Store (this will also give you the Mann Co. Cap)
* Purchasing something from the Mann Co. Online Store (this will also give you the Mann Co. Online Cap) 
* Using an Upgrade to Premium Gift

# There are so many things to buy! What should I pick?

There are a couple of ways you can go about this...
* Many people on this sub suggest trying out a weapon, then purchasing it. While this is indeed the cheapest way, the weapon you will get is uncraftable, and you have the chance of finding it in-game (for free), so I wouldn't do this if I wanted some use out of my purchase.
* If you want lots of uncraftable weapons, or you're the gambling type, buy Mann Co. Supply Crate Keys *BUT ONLY ONCE*!!! On the Community Market, they sell for a lot less. Once you have the key, you can either uncrate something (I suggest not; you'll lose profit 99% of the time) or you can sell the key for around 5 refined metal and 2 reclaimed metal, which you can then smelt into scrap, which you can then buy weapons with from something like scrap.tf.

I hope this post educated you on what premium acccounts are in TF2, and I'd love to hear feedback on this. If you have any more questions, add me on Steam: http://steamcommunity.com/id/silversp.

Playing on pl_badwater last night, defending the final area, Cart is at the top of the slope and we are holding the choke just beyond that, at the corner. Usual thing. Then a Demo on my team keeps calling for me to switch to Kritzkrieg. Which seems to me like a bad call to me considering there are multiple heavies with a medic coming in, running standard Medi Gun, I am the only medic, with the usual 3 snipers and 2 or 3 spies on out team.

I felt that my priority should be to keep as many defenders healed up and alive, and building Uber, to counter theirs. If I had run Kritzkrieg, sure we would build faster and do more damage, but if they pop standard Uber, anyone I kritz as well as myself would be cut down in no time. And then we would have the extra time as red to spawn.

I do know what a spy is and does, but I'm baffled by the intricacies of them.

I've tried playing spy a few times, as I can see times where my team could use one, but I end up doing terrible and wasting a team slot.

A few questions if you don't mind:

1) Can you stab/sap while in stealth, or do you have to come out of stealth and THEN stab/sap?

2) When playing against spies, I've killed the same spy 3 times within a minute, only to have them backstab me literally seconds later. How is this possible? They don't have any teleports, and I know for a fact it takes much longer than 10 seconds to walk all the way across the map.

3) How do you sap multiple things at once (turret/dispenser)? I've had it done to me, but when I'm a spy, I can only place one at a time.

4) When cloaking, how long does it last? The little ""charge bar"" empties, but I stay in stealth? Am I really in stealth or does it just appear that I am? What is that little bar anyway?

Anyway, I've started playing again recently, and today I was on a 32 slot  server playing Blue on the first section of Gold Rush. I'm assuming that these servers are kind of bottom of the pile in terms of game quality, as we had something like 4 spies and 3 snipers. We started the round fairly well and pushed the cart up to the first checkpoint pretty much straight away. There was a bit of a fight in the tunnel, but we managed to push it all the way round the corner and out into the open. Playing as scout, I got lucky and managed to crouch behind the cart and push it within a few feet of the target.

From then on, the game reached a stalemate, but the one thing that I noticed was that nobody on my team seemed to care about the cart moving back and seemed more concerned with killing the other team than at the very least stopping the countdown. I found myself pretty much constantly sacrificing myself by running at the cart just to stop it from moving back.

Am I just not realising some sort of important strategic element here? I'm sure if the whole team had gone up together and actually pushed the cart for a few seconds then we would have won. As it was, we wasted about ten minutes doing nothing and ran out of time. Is this a symptom of the server I was playing on, or am I at fault here?

Dead Ringer vs InvisiWatch, Spy-Cicle vs Knife, 
and Spy Tactics",theif519,10,0,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/njspb/spy_loadout_suggestions_revolver_vs_enforcer_dead/,"Personally I use the Revolver over the Enforcer because I find it more accurate, but I'm not so sure about that now. Although Revolver feels more accurate, some people are saying that they both have the same accuracy and firing patterns, and that Enforcer is a clear upgrade. For some reason when I use the Enforcer, I end up missing quite a bit, but when I use Revolver, I end up hitting quite a bit more. For instance, let's say a W + M1 Pyro is coming for me, I'd take out my revolver and put him down in 4 shots easily, especially if I use Spy Cicle, which grants me 2 seconds of immunity to fire. But with Enforcer I end up missing quite a bit more. I can get 1 / 3 shots to connect but with Revolver I get 3 / 4 from close range, 1 / 4 with Enforcer from Long Range and 2 / 4 with Revolver with Long Range. I suppose it's psychological effect on my part. 

With InvisiWatch, I can cloak and get behind enemy lines and get decent picks and chain stabs, but with Dead Ringer, I can take a few pot shots with Revolver on low health classes, and then get away easily. With InvisiWatch I can be more strategical, but with Dead Ringer I can be more direct with kills. Also, with Dead Ringer, if I get hit by a Pyro I can take out my Spy - Cicle and lose a Pyro, but I can do so more efficiently with InvisiWatch but will be taking damage by other classes. 

With Spy - Cicle, I can easily backstab and get away easily from Pyros, or gun down Pyros who go after me, but the ice statues gives away that there's a spy and they remain their for quite some time. Sometimes when I try to get trick stabs on Pyros I fail because it melts. With the Knife, it's more all-around but not good for getaways since there's no fire immunity, but good for a pick and run.

Its stats are great, but there's quite a few disadvantages.",blauxuu,12,2,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/kssro/proper_use_of_the_stickybomb_launcher_its_stats/,"I'm not sure why, but stickies don't seem to work well for me. Am I doing it wrong?

I love playing Demo as a faster, rapid-firing direct hit soldier (because basically, that's exactly what the grenade launcher does), but stickies seem to have very limited options to me.
Having eight shots with high damage is good, but the lack of speed (both firing and detonating happens rather slowly) is a severe drawback.

1. Jumping: Meh, usually requires a pocket medic.
2. Traps: I find myself utterly bored with this, as people hardly ever fall twice for this. They're just a bit too easy to avoid I guess...good to scare people away and make them waste time, though.
3. Airburst: Here's what really annoys me, these things are awfully slow. Anything but a heavy (or a sentry, to be precise) will get hit by the first one for about 60 dmg, due to the large blast radius, and then move out. You can literally see these things coming by a mile. I'm not particularly good at dodging, and I rarely ever die to this.
4. Spam: Spamming the point seems to be what most offense Demos are doing, and it works if the enemy is distracted and not moving. Still, I feel like this could be done easily (and quickly) with the grenade launcher, since distracted enemies are pretty much a free kill who go down in less that two seconds if your pipebombs connect.

The two things that worked best for me was taking out sentries, which could have been done with a little more effort with the Launcher as well, and doing damage around corners, e.g., if a group of RED is waiting for the payload cart there. That's about it. I'd swap the stickies for a Shotgun if that was an option...


Tl, dr:

It seems to me that in direct combat, the Stickies are just a slow substitute for Pipes which require a little less aiming.
And I don't really like Sticky camping.
 
Am I missing any important points, and how do you guys get the most out of the sticky launcher?

Autoexec.cfg gets run each time you connect to a server.  Maybe more often, I'm not sure.

My autoexec.cfg:

    alias vmoff ""r_drawviewmodel 0""
    alias vmon ""r_drawviewmodel 1""

I use these often later on.

I created a ""reset.cfg"" file that I source from every class-specific .cfg file.  When I change binds or settings in one of the other files, I reset it here.  Also, whenever I use a number key to select a weapon, I also invoke the corresponding vm# alias to turn the viewmodel on or off.  The vm# aliases can be changed in the individual class files to turn viewmodels on or off for specific weapons.  By default I turn viewmodels off for everything except melee, which is always in slot 3.

reset.cfg:

    echo ""in reset.cfg""
    cl_autoreload 1
    zoom_sensitivity_ratio 1.0
    r_drawviewmodel 0

    bind mouse1 +attack
    bind mouse2 +attack2
    
    alias vm1 vmoff
    alias vm2 vmoff
    # viewmodels on for melee
    alias vm3 vmon
    alias vm4 vmoff
   
    bind 1 ""vm1; slot1""
    bind 2 ""vm2; slot2""
    bind 3 ""vm3; slot3""
    bind 4 ""vm4; slot4""


Here I created a +gopistol alias to let me hot-switch from scattergun to pistol by holding down the right mouse button.  When I let go of it, I switch back to scattergun. This way I can switch between my main weapons without taking my fingers off the movement keys.

This is not useful when I'm using the sandman, because you need +attack2 to hit the ball.  So when I switch to the bat in slot3 I bind mouse2 back to +attack2.

When you bind a button to +aliasname, releasing the button gets automatically linked to  the corresponding -aliasname.

scout.cfg:

    echo ""in scout.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    alias scout_scat ""vm1; slot1; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    alias scout_pistol ""vm2; slot2; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    alias scout_bat ""vm3; slot3; bind mouse2 +attack2""
    
    bind 1 scout_scat
    bind 2 scout_pistol
    bind 3 scout_bat
    
    alias +gopistol scout_pistol
    alias -gopistol scout_scat

    scout_scat

For soldier I have the same hot-switch as with scout, but it's simpler here since soldier doesn't have a use for +attack2.

soldier.cfg:

    echo ""in soldier.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    alias +goshotty ""vm2; slot2""
    alias -goshotty ""vm1; slot1""

    bind mouse2 +goshotty

I haven't done anythiing for pyro.cfg.  I've thought about switching to axe or shotgun right after an airblast, but it doesn't seem useful enough.

pyro.cfg:

    echo ""in pyro.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

Nothing in demoman.cfg either.  I've been thinking about getting a rapid-fire sticky script since I can't do that very reliably.

demoman.cfg:

    echo ""in demoman.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

Nothing in heavyweapons.cfg either.

heavyweapons.cfg:

    echo ""in heavyweapons.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

Here I have the engineer hot-swapping between shotgun and pistol like before.  For slot4 I have to restore right-click to +attack2 because **the engie can rotate his buildings with right-click before he builds them**.

engineer.cfg:

    echo ""in engineer.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg
    
    alias eng_shotgun ""vm1; slot1""
    alias eng_pistol ""vm2; slot2""
    
    bind 1 ""eng_shotgun; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    bind 2 ""eng_pistol; bind mouse2 +gopistol""
    bind 3 ""vm3; slot3""
    bind 4 ""vm4; slot4; bind mouse2 +attack2""

    bind mouse2 +gopistol

    alias +gopistol eng_pistol
    alias -gopistol eng_shotgun
    
    eng_shotgun

Nothing in medic.cfg.

medic.cfg:

    echo ""in medic.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

I've heard that reducing mouse sensitivity when you're zoomed makes you a better sniper.  I can't vouch for that myself.

sniper.cfg:

    echo ""in sniper.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    zoom_sensitivity_ratio 0.5

When I'm spy I absolutely need viewmodels on because otherwise I get horribly confused about whether I'm cloaked or I have the dead ringer out or other things.  Also, when you have your knife equipped you raise your arm when you are in stabbing range.  I turn off autoreload for the pistol because the reload animation is distracting.

spy.cfg:

    echo ""in spy.cfg""
    exec reset.cfg

    # turn viewmodels on for all 4 slots
    alias vm1 vmon
    alias vm2 vmon
    alias vm3 vmon
    alias vm4 vmon

    cl_autoreload 0
    r_drawviewmodel 1

Since I don't really want to take the time to sell them I figured I'd rather give them away to people who would get some good use out of them. Since it's the season for giving and all.

So here are the rules to enter:

1. Less than 200 hours on TF2
2. Scout must be in your top 3 played classes
3. You don't already have a strange scattergun or a shit ton of expensive items
4. Put your steamurl in your post
5. Pick a number betwee 1-200 in the 000 format (aka 42 is 042) then [Tell me what game my Steam name and avatar are in reference to.](http://steamcommunity.com/id/rikonstruct)

There will be 3 winners and I'm doing the whole ""scout as top 3 played"" because I'm really interested in giving these away to people who will enjoy these items and not just resell them.

I'll pick the winners in 48ish hours.

Thanks a bunch!

**The winners are MikeyTwoGuns, darktoasteroven and Alpha_x_Beta.**

Mikey and Dark were the only two to completely follow the rules so they got the scattergun by default. Alpha was the one to get closest to the random.org number so he wins too!

It is a new form of competition mode (different to 6v6 that only has class locks to one for demo and medic) that is quickly gaining steam  in the competitive TF2 community. The Round Robin is a tournament that aims to help bridge the gap between watching casts and participating! 

If you're interested in having a one day taste of the progression in a Highlander tournament and you're in the EU, we will place you in a team and assign your team an established team. This team will then mentor your team in the ways of highlander and they will run the server that you will play on for the duration of the tournament.

The scope of the mentorship is down to the individuals and the team. Everyone gets out as much as they put in.

How do I get the most out of  a push?

My thoughts, abridged:

From my experience, people use the stock medigun to push into a choke, or try and hold on to a point. It can also be used to save the medic's life. In attack/defense maps I've never known whether I should push with it to delay a push, or save it and stop a push with it.

Kritzkrieg ubers are obviously used to wipe out the other team. It charges fast, so a good player can stop a normal uber before it is complete. I don't trust this one to get through dustbowl-style chokes, but it works well in open areas to hold back the other team.

Quick-Fix: We're just talking about the uber. I've hardly used this, but when I did I tried to pop when the normal healing rate was just too slow to keep anyone alive. Apparently this one heals you at about 100 health/second when it's targeting someone (during uber), so it could maybe save a medic almost as well as a normal medigun ubercharge.

Here is the technique I use. To any pyros out there, please write how you would counter this. To soldiers, please post how you fight pyros. I would love the insight. 

My loadout
-direct hit
-shotgun
-equalizer

Because I am using the DH(I never use the stock rocket launcher anymore), there is no way a pyro can reflect without reflecting before I shoot a rocket. I noticed pyros reflect when I have my crosshairs on them, or twitch my crosshair really fast to them. This is good. Keep twitching your aim across the pyro's body, and at a random moment actually fire(preferably after he airblasts). (NOTE: This requires at least decent aim with the direct hit. not high, because he isn't actually really strafing to avoid rockets. The pyro is trying to reflect them back into you). After doing this once or twice, one shot should have landed( assuming decent aim). The pyro is now in the air or the pyro just bounced in the another direction. Whatever the case, a decent pyro will be ready to reflect. If you have good aim, twitch your aim really fast. The pyro should reflect again. Then just hit him again. If you have bad airshot skills, just switch to your shotgun when the pyro is in the air. 

If the pyro starts to just run at you and airblasts you into the air. ONLY fire rockets after airblasts. He may get wise to this, and just continuously run at you and hit you with flames. This is good. shotgun once and switch back to the DH, he should airblast, then just finish him off with a good direct hit, and the above techniques. It is important to keep an eye on the pyro's current weapon. If he switches to the axetinguisher, you must quickly switch to the direct hit, or you will die. 

Other general tips
-always make sure you have a spare rocket. When a pyro moves in to axetinguish you he should never be able to if you switch to your direct hit fast enough. 

-If you are good, you can also switch back and forth with your shotgun to land shots after a good direct hit. 


-remember, fighting the pyro is a bit similar to poker. Try unexpected tactics


-keep an eye on his current weapon. For example, if the pyro pulls out his flaregun, shotgun him. I would not recommend a rocket because a decent pyro would quickly switch to reflect. 

For the stock rocket launcher, I have seen others use only the splash damage to damage the pyro. Then the soldier quickly shotguns the pyro to death.

I'd log on, but my favorites were gone and the server browser wouldn't bring up any results (both inside TF2 and in the Steam browser.) I checked my filters, but that didn't help. I searched Steams forums and knowledge base and tried to download a new master server list file, but that didn't help, either. I've tried connecting via my wifi, plugging directly into my modem, re-installing Steam, TF2, drivers, etc. Nothing.

In the end, I've given up trying to use the server browser and just connect via the console commands. I usually just go to [Game Tracker](http://www.gametracker.com/search/tf2/?) to find servers. It works, but it's kind of a pain in the ass and I can't save favorites.

What sucks even more is that I can't connect to games that my Steam friends are playing in. I click on the option to join their game, but I get an error message saying that the server can't be found. So, I have friends, but I can never play on the same server as them.

For some reason, the problem seemed to go away for a week in October, but came right back. Weird.

I am currently using Comcast and connecting via a [Motorola SURFboard Gateway SBG901 Wireless Cable Modem](http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-SURFboard-Gateway-SBG901-Wireless/dp/B002M3SJ6U/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1329496623&amp;sr=8-11)

Like I said, I understand that this is a known issue where the ISP apparently thinks TF2 is sending out spam or something as it searches for servers. However, I am hoping that there is a fix or work-around for this.

Now that I am able to trade however, I would like to know some things before I jump into trading, and would appreciate it very much if the community can help me.

1. Standard prices on normal weapons/items? I am talking about weapons without the strange or vintage annotations. Do they all go for 1 scrap metal usually?

2. I see that ""keys"" are used also for payment, just like metals. What are they exactly and what is their current worth?

3. The price range for hats? I have seen the spreadsheet, but I was wondering on general price ranges, such as: craftable hats, drop only hats, unusual hats, and so on. 

4. I also have some coupons:
-33% off valve
-25% off valve
-50% off Batman: Arkham Asylum
-50% off Shattered Horizon
are these worth anything in the TF2 economy?

5. Also, do you have any tips to earning metals and items for a person new to the TF2 economy?

I'm a low experience medic and yesterday I played a 6v6 PUG for newbie players. I didn't do terrible and wasn't a total newbie to competitive play beforehand but there where a few things I have questions about. Any answers are greatly appreciated.  
  
1. Midfights. It seems like me surviving a midfight was the exception rather than the rule. Is there some secret to positioning / dodging that will increase my survivability at mid? Especially on badlands where generally stayed behind the train car they would bomb in a soldier and kill me every time. 
  
2. Medic Picks. When my team got a medic pick, my intuition tells me ""okay, this is when the team needs to get aggresive and capitalize on the lack of enemy heals"" so I would move more forward. However usually the other team would become medic-seeking missles and try extra hard to pick me off to even out the ubers so my attempt at aggression would get me killed.

Edit 2:  Wow I am just blown away! The group has literally grown from just a few people on my friends list. to 268+ people!!  This is honestly some of the most fun I have had in TF2 in a long time.  I'm loving all the funny comments we are getting.

Also, wanted to mention that RationalArgumentMan has stepped to the plate for everyone and is offering not only a free hat but also quite a few items from his backpack.  He is going to be picking winners for that and I will post an update to the group.  So now there is even more chances that you can at least win something!!

First I want to say thank you all so much for participating.  If I could I would give each and everyone of you a free hat.  I hope you have found that this is a fun group and you will stick around to see what's next.  We have a lot of ideas and plans for the future.

Congratulations you two, I will send you a friend request and get you your new hats!!

Now I got a lot of great comments as well, so I wanted to do something for the 2 best comments that I felt exemplify the community the best and also made me laugh. :)

These two people have each won a Noble Amassment of Hats because of course they are ""For the Gentleman who believes even his hat deserves a hat."".  Here are the quotes and the winners.

Reportedly Mr. John Hetherington, English haberdasher and supposed inventor of the top hat, had ""appeared on the public highway wearing upon his head what he called a silk hat, a structure with a shinty lustre calculated to frighten timid people"". Officers of the Crown stated that ""several women fainted at the unusual sight, while children screamed, dogs yelped and a younger son of Cordwainer Thomas was thrown down by the crowd which collected and had his right arm broken.""	

Congratulations you two, I will send you a friend request and get you your new hats!!

Now that isn't all.  RationalArgumentMan has decided to give out a free hat and some items to people.  He will be choosing the people and sending them the trades.  So keep your eyes open for that as well. :)

I'd really like to play Demo, the problem is: I absolutely dislike the sticky launcher. Yes, the tactical advantages are obvious, but I really don't like any kind of ""turtling"" gameplay (I really don't feel like camping at a sticky trap and wait for oblivious heavies), and in direct combat, you'll have to worry about timing, distance and direction - only to deal about 60 dmg each. 

Which brings me to the main weapon. It's great, actually, if it could actually hit something directly.
The odd tajectory is one thing, but the fact that it doesn't even aim properly is really annoying. 
Is there any patch or script to fix the cross-hair of the demoman?
It really annoys me when I have to stick the launcher up an enemies nose to hit him directly with a pipe bomb (and anybody smart and fast enough will avoid the bounce-off explosion). Loch n load would be nice, but only having two shots is way too much of a nerf.

So, I thought about the following set:

Grenade Launcher
Chargin' Targe (screen is nice, but the resistances are a huge advantage I guess...)
Half-Zatoichi (basically a straight upgrade of the bottle, if used sparingly. Persian Persuader would pretty much negate the use of the Grenade Launcher).

So, any recommendations, advice or suggestions for a Demoman with the stock Grenade Launcher as weapon of choice?

I have been trying to get better at it. One problem I'm having is with the Sentry Zapper. Whenever I am cloaked and walk up to a sentry, I try to use it but it never works. I can see the white outline on the sentry when I'm next to it, but I can never get it to work. Do I have to hold down the primary attack for a few seconds? Usually, I am nervous when I am cloaked and make it to a sentry, that I just frantically keep clicking it and then run away and/or die.


Also, if anyone could give some advice for playing a spy, that would help a lot. I usually get behind most of the enemies before disguising myself which seems obvious. Should you always make sure you're disguised though? It just seems better to always make sure you're disguised as an enemy.

One of my favorite things about tf2 is the variety of unique playstyles available due to weapon loadouts, and I'm here to hopefully inspire you to try out my personal favorite: the bleed-scout!

**What's a bleed-scout?** A bleed-scout is a scout who focuses on using weapons which cause bleeding. These weapons are:

* [The Boston Basher](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Boston_Basher)/[Three-Rune Blade](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Three-Rune_Blade) - A melee weapon which (in addition to causing damage on impact) causes your enemy to bleed for 5 seconds. If you miss your enemy, you do damage and cause bleeding to yourself.
* [The Flying Guillotine](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Flying_Guillotine) - A secondary weapon which is thrown (and will subsequently recharge) which causes damage on impact as well as bleeding.
* [The Wrap Assassin](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Wrap_Assassin) (I don't really like/use this one) - A melee weapon which has a secondary fire to launch a projectile similar to the flying guillotine (except weaker) which causes bleeding. Significantly reduced melee damage.

[Bleeding](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bleeding), for those who don't know, is an effect which causes damage every .5 seconds as well as causing flinching and red screen flashing. Bleeding can be very useful for disorienting enemies, revealing cloaked spies, and of course causing damage.

Note: While it's very much possible to utilize these weapons in addition to your primary, I find avoiding using your primary weapon makes playing bleed-scout way more fun.

**How do I play bleed-scout?** Beyond using weapons which cause bleeding, this is entirely up to you! BUT, from hours upon hours of playing bleed-scout, I have some tips:

* Hit and Run - one of the best parts about using bleeding weapons is that you can cause damage well after your encounter with the enemy. Use this to your advantage by starting them bleeding and getting out of harms way before they have a chance to attack
* Steal Healthpacks - This is especially useful for the boston basher/three-rune blade as you will often need health yourself. Once somebody is bleeding they will often run to the nearest healthpack, either grab it before engaging or beat them to it to make the most out of the bleed damage.
* Focus on Cleanup/Assists - taking on any full health opponent with your bleeding weapons is risky as the bleed damage takes time. Instead get opponents started and either you or a teammate can finish them off later, or catch fleeing, weakened opponents and take them out before they can get away.
* Basher Jumps - A more advanced technique, but powerful if you can learn it. By hitting yourself with the boston basher/three-rune blade it's possible to increase your jumping height/distance significantly. A good demonstration can be seen [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1oiH2XMCzo).

**Why should I play bleed-scout?** I'm going to be honest here, playing bleed-scout, especially when playing without use of your primary weapon, is not the most powerful tactic for winning games. It is on the other hand,  EXTREMELY FUN! It opens up a whole new style of gameplay similar to how playing demoknight is a totally new game from playing regular demoman. Also, it's a great way practice melee battles, arcing projectiles, and alternate map routes.

---

**Now to get you started making your opponents bleed, a raffle!**

I'm going to be giving away:

* 5X Regular bleed-sets - Five people will recieve both a Boston Basher and a Flying Guillotine
* 2X Strange bleed-sets - Two people will recieve both a Strange Boston Basher and a Strange Flying Guillotine
* 1X Three-Rune Blade - Screw spikey bats, one person will get a MOTHERFUCKING SWORD

To enter, just comment with a number from 000-999 as well as your steam ID. I would love to give these away to newer players, but everybody is more than welcome to enter! The raffle will end this Friday at 10PM PDT and winners will be announced shortly after. Good luck everyone!

Lastly, if you want to practice bleed-scout or just play around, come by the Stompfest Doomsday server 74.91.113.177:27015 I'll often be there making everybody bleed :D

The problem is the dinging can get annoying when I light someone on fire, or make them bleed, or use an automatic weapon. I think bubbles would be a nice sound instead, it’s about the least grating thing I can think of.

Details inside.,,11,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/1ay7op/psa_never_buy_any_weapons_from_the_mann_co_store/,"I see a lot of new players fall for this, so I thought I'd warn you: Mann Co. Weapons are ridiculously overpriced- they can range anywhere from USD .49 to 9.99- but you can get them for pennies.Instead of buying one or two weapons from the store for $5 (the minimum amount of funds to add to your steam wallet), do this: 

1. Buy two Mann Co Supply Crate keys at 2.50 apiece. This will also make your account premium.

2. Minimize tf2 (Protip: alt+tab minimizes everything on windows) and direct your browser to [scrap.tf](http://scrap.tf)

3. Sign in at the top right and click ""bank keys"", then click ""sell keys""

4. You'll be added to a queue at the top of the page. Look for your profile picture as it moves along to the left.

5. When your profile picture is first in the queue, a bot from scrap.tf will send you a friend request on steam. Accept it, and they'll invite you to trade!

6. Add the two keys you bought to the trading window. The bot should add metal to their window. Make sure everything is correct, then click ""ready to trade"" then ""trade"".

7. You now have around eight refined metal! Alt-tab back into tf2 and from the main menu or pause screen, click items&gt;crafting&gt;smelt refined metal. Smelt your refined metals into twenty-four reclaimed metals, then smelt those into seventy-two scrap metals.

8. Go back to scrap.tf in your browser, and click ""bank weapons"". Click any of the bots, but *not* Scrap Weapons.

9. Select the weapons you want (every two weapons costs one scrap metal) then click finish trade. Wait through the queue again. 

10. Again, accept the friend request from the bot and put up the amount of scrap metal that it asks for. When the bot puts up the weapons you want, click ready to trade and then trade. New weapons!

11. Repeat steps 8-10. If you want, you can purchase priority queuing for four scraps to reduce the wait time. If you don't see the weapon you are looking for, click a different bot. Remember to buy your weapons in pairs, because 3 weaps and 4 weaps both cost 2 scrap.

$5.00 is more than enough to buy every weapon in the game - I reccomend doing so.

**[EDIT]**
Ok, so a wise man named Lapper told me to include more stuff in this to help out more. Here we go. I always tell those who are new to TF2 what I call the Class Difficulty Drop Chart. Easiest at the top, hardest at the bottom, or for number fans, easiest is 1, hardest is 9. If I mention a droppable item or special tactic, it's name will link to it's wiki page for you to check out.

* **Soldier**: Difficulty Level: 1

Playing Soldier is all about dealing damage. His weapons are menacing at close to mid range, and if someone is out of that range, [rocket jumping](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Jumping#Basic_rocket_jump) is a good way to get there quickly.

* **Heavy**: Difficulty Level: 2

Playing Heavy is all about keeping the enemies back. He can deal and take lots of damage, and with a [Sandvich](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sandvich) or the [Buffalo Steak Sandvich](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Buffalo), you can support your team by giving them health when it's scarce, or just eat it yourself for a full heal or other handy effects. Medics go great with him.

* **Scout**: Difficulty Level: 3

Playing Scout is all about hit and run. He's so fast, most won't be able shoot him before he rounds the corner. However, he has rather low health, and only his scattergun can deal a lot of damage in one shot. Scout has several uses, such as quickly grabbing intel, capping capture points and pushing payloads twice as fast, and distracting [sentries](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sentry) with [BONK!](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Bonk!_Atomic_Punch). Don't expect to get a lot of kills as him.

* **Demoman**: Difficulty Level: 4

Playing Demoman either requires patience or accuracy. He is a defensive class, with good health and ok speed, and can use stickybombs to defend objectives easily and often secretly. You need to be crafty when shooting stickybombs, as they can be destroyed by bullets and melee weapons. Accuracy is important with the grenade launcher. On a direct hit, a bomb that hasn't hit anything before an enemy will automatically explode on him, dealing lots of damage. Also, there's Demo-knighting, which changes him into a melee only tank. [Here is a set of weapons based around Demo-knighting.](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/One_Thousand_and_One_Demoknights)

* **Pyro**: Difficulty Level: 5

Playing Pyro is actually a real art. Pyro is restricted to very close range weapons, with [one acception](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Flare_Gun). It's flamethrower deals damage from it's fire and [afterburn](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Afterburn), which deals damage at a constant rate until it is put out. Right clicking with it's flamethrower will do an airblast, which, using 20 ammo, expels a burst of air that can rebound rockets, grenades, [Jarate](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Jarate), and more, including people. It's shotgun and fire axe leave it as very close range, so avoid Snipers. Also, the combination of the Degreaser, Reserve Shooter, and Axtinguisher is a VERY effective combo loadout if used right, which takes some practice.

* **Sniper**: Difficulty Level: 6

Yes, I think playing Sniper is harder than Pyro. Sniper can't quite fend for himself, since his SMG is his only close-ranged weapon, so he is best used if you know good sniping spots and locations of health and ammo. Right clicking activates his Sniper Rifles scope, allowing for you to deal headshots, which can one-shot most classes at full charge. By the way, longer time scoped = more charge = more damage if you fire while in that scope. He has a [few](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sleeper) [other](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Machina) [rifles](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Hitmans_Heatmaker), but he also can get the Huntsman, a bow and arrow that instantly kills on headshots. It allows for him to get much closer to the fight.

* **Medic**: Difficulty Level: **7**

Medic is hard to play, but almost essential for success. He [heals (and overheals) the team](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Healing) with his Medi-Gun, and can deploy [ubercharge](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Ubercharge) with right click when he heals enough. His Syringe Gun allows for short-ranged damage, but Medic shouldn't be the one fighting, with some acceptions. Medics are the top priority, and if you are a Medic, just stay alive and build up ubercharge. This may mean you must ditch a group if the situation gets too hairy. If you see an enemy Medic, * **KILL HIM FIRST.** *

* **Engineer**: Difficulty Level: **8**

Engineer requires patience, skill, smarts, and a knack for micro-management. He is near useless on his own, but he can build stuff with his PDAs. He has not just health, but metal, which he gets from ammo drops and uses it to build and upgrade his buildings. [Sentries](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Sentry), automated turrets, [Dispencers](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dispencer), which heal and give ammo to teammates, and [entry and exit teleporter nodes](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Teleporter). Buy hitting 4, selecting the building you want with 1, 2, 3, or 4, and click in a legitimate spot to start building. To make the thing build faster, hit it with your wrench. To upgrade it, hit it with your wrench. If a Spy tries to sap your buildings, (you'll see it in the building GUI and your stuff will stop working) kill the Spy, then hit your buildings with your wrench to remove the sappers. Just saying, you may not save all of them, so go for the dispencer first! Also, try building in strategic spots.

* **Spy**: Difficulty Level: * **HARDEST** *

Spy is by far the hardest class to play, and, sadly, the most played class by new players. DON'T PLAY SPY UNTIL YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE AS ALL OTHER CLASSES FIRST. YOU WILL NEED TO KNOW HABITS OF ALL OTHER CLASSES TO PLAY SPY. Spy can turn invisible and disguise as other players, including the other team, and kills classes instantly upon a backstab with his knife. Spy's job is to infiltrate the enemy's base and loosen them up for other classes. Good disguises are Demomen and Snipers if used well. Never, I MEAN NEVER, disguise as Heavy, Scout, Pyro or Engineer. You are too fast to be a Heavy, too slow to be a Scout, not fireproof like a Pyro, and not busy like Engineers. He can also attack while disguised, but it removes your disguise when you do. Plus, cloaking and de-cloaking makes noise, and may give of smoke, so be alert for that. The most effective Spies never de-cloack near enemies, and must act like their disguise. Also, when disguised as the enemy, you can call for enemy Medics by pressing ""e"". Be careful doing that for your first time, though, because you get an achievement for tricking a Medic, and it may give you away.

**TL;DR** The list goes easiest to hardest: Soldier, Heavy, Scout, Demoman, Pyro, Sniper, Medic, Engineer, Spy. Wait before playing your first time as Spy.

Anyway, if you need any knowledge on TF2, just ask! I don't even care if it's listed above, just let me help you by helping you help us help us all.

I'm somewhat knowledgeable about TF2 trading, and I want to share my expertise with new people. So let's get started.

**Buying from the Mann Co store**

Do not buy hats or weapons. The items you receive are dirty(uncraftable) and therefore not worth a lot. Most weapons in there can be bought for 1 scrap each, and are horribly overpriced (Almost $4 for a weapon worth 1 scrap? Come on Valve). It's much better to buy keys and trade for the items you want.

The only items worth buying from the Mann Co. store are keys(They are worth the most in terms of metal/money) and the Sticky and Rocket Jumpers(They are hard to come by otherwise).

**Weapons**

All weapons that you can find via random drop that haven't been released in the last 3 months or so can be bought for 1 scrap metal each. Newer items are worth more, because they have just come out and there's not a lot in supply. The first thing you should do is to build up a collection of all of the different weapons.

**Hats**

All craftable hats are worth at least 1 refined. Some are worth more, because people think that they look better. If you find one, don't sell it for any less.

**Unusuals**

If you are ever lucky enough to uncrate an unusual, make sure to get a price check from r/tf2trade before you consider selling it. Unusuals are worth a heck of a lot and it's just too easy to get scammed for them.

I tried it out a lot lately, 'cause I kind of like the concept.

More ammo is good, but nothing outstanding. 
And the other ""features"", well, one of them was supposed to make sticky jumping easier, but isn't useful for horizontal movement, and the selective detonation would be great if it was optional...

* Opinions within nominated submitted work are allowed, but disrespectful opinions directed at players will disqualify it.

* There may be valid reasons outside of this listed criteria.  For any circumstances that arise that require mod attention, we will discuss it on a case by case basis and make updates as needed.

This all changed, however, when I ventured upon a group of experienced players (a lot more hours than I had at that time) who were willing to explain to me the game and how to play it correctly.

A few examples would be: how to rocket jump (I didn't know how to do that back then???), how to take advantage of each class's strength and mitigate each's weakness, etc.

I would not be the player as I am now (involved in competitive 6v6 on 3 teams) if not for those awesome players who gave me the insight that really helped me advanced my game.

I know that A LOT of emphasis is placed on the obtainable items in TF2.  Please note that these items ARE NOT UPGRADES.  Too often do I see new players sporting terrible weapons because they are under the illusion that these items are good.  Almost all of them are quirky and take a good understanding of gameplay to use effectively.  

IF YOU WISH TO IMPROVE YOUR OVERALL SKILLS AT THIS GAME- use the vanilla weapons.  These standards are normally the best item anyways (of course some exceptions exist).  OH- and a quick note to all medics- **The quick fix requires a tremendous amount of teamwork, skill, and the right scenario to be useful**.  Almost always the medigun is better, especially on offense.

[x-post from r/tf2],dekom,10,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewToTF2/comments/he9c9/tf2_competitive_irc_channel_for_inexperiencednew/,"As the captain of a newly-formed, inexperienced competitive 6v6 team, I had the extreme displeasure in setting up scrims with teams that I thought were low or new, but turned out to be mid/high players in a pug. We were being out-DMed and out-organized on all levels. Our scrims were nothing more than rollout practices, as we would often wipe on mid or second without any time to develop any form of defense. This lowered my team's morale dramatically, and at one point, two of our main players considered quitting competitive TF2 because the experience could ruin TF2 in general.

To solve the problem, I posted on CommFT forums asking for new/inexperienced teams as practice partners. I received many more responses than I had anticipated, which indicated to me that we're not the only one experiencing trouble finding low/new teams.

Because there appear to be a decent number of teams interested in this concept, I decided to create an IRC channel to assist new/low teams in getting quality scrims.

My greatest hope is that the channel can bring in more teams from pubs to the competitive scene. However, in order for that to happen, the channel needs exposure. I've posted it on CommFT forums, and I've talked to couple players that's known throughout the community, hoping to get the word out.

I would like reddit to help as well.

IRC channel: #tf2newteams on gamesurge.net Owner/OP(me): http://steamcommunity.com/id/foolkom
