Heaven forbid you dare to compare the two versions. It's happened to me several times now and I've seen it happen to other people as well. I'm not even some PC elitist coming from the PC version of Minecraft to claim this one is horrible. I prefer to play the game on the Xbox and I really didn't have a choice because the adventure update made the game too laggy to play on my aging laptop. The Xbox version runs smoothly and I prefer the interface, I'm not against it. I've made few points in a couple of comments about the Xbox version that were not inflammatory in anyway and yet I get downvoted for no reason other than mentioning the PC version on here. My opinion was simply that I believe the Xbox version should try to get as close to the PC version as possible before it starts adding new things onto it, that's all. I got my head completely bitten off no reason and nobody even bothered to actually say why they disagree with me, they just got my comment collapsed without a single word. It's maddening.

I hate to be one of those people who go 'hur dur bring on the downvotes!!!11!' but I seriously doubt this post will get much love and will probably even prove my point about this weird hatred the subreddit has when it comes to the PC version being brought up in discussion. Rather than downvote, give me a reason why this is. I want to know what the mindset is.

Also, Just to keep you all informed here is a list of bugs reported via [Minecraftforum.net](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1756700-mcxbla-official-known-bugs-list-tu9/)

^^^^^credit ^^^^^goes ^^^^^to ^^^^^the ^^^^^respective ^^^^^authors ^^^^^of ^^^^^the ^^^^^posts ^^^^^linked ^^^^^above

* Various Sound Bugs
* Animals Glitching Out of Fences
* Bookshelves do not seem to be giving bonuses to the enchanting table.
* Enderdragon Doesn't Take Damage on Creative Mode (except TNT damage) 
* Normal potions, not splash, disappear when I dispense them. 
* level 1 splash potions only last for 1 second. 
* Can't Jump off ladders or vines.
* Ghasts act like enderman and teleport every once in a while.
* Cannot place pressure plates on nether fences, but regular fences you can.
* Cannot grow melons and pumpkins on dirt, (this was in pc 1.1) 
* Some of the enchantment tables in my world are also distorted even when replace the distortion is still there. 
* Ender Portals do not go away after breaking the frame in creative mode.
* Running a server now...all players except the host are kicked on every auto save.. Set on survival, easy and 15 min interval.
* Minecarts can no longer sit on top of ladders, thus rendering minecart hopping type elevators useless. 
* TnT causing the game to lag. Just using 1 causes a moment of lag. The more you use, the worse it gets.
* The old invisible chests have made a reappearance. 
* Fence gates are glitched, they act like BUDS
* Pistons - blocks pushed/pulled buy sticky pistons are vanishing again. (4 tick timer)
* Vines will replace water when going down. If they grow down and encounter a water block, it will be replaced and the surrounding water blocks will constantly try to flow into the spot where the vine is with no success. 
* the items in minecraft store they re gone just menus in blank
* Mining double half slabs with a silk touch pick still results in getting back only 1 half slab, not 2.

_________________________________________________________________________

*The announcement for winners has been pushed back to the following Friday to both keep the contest weekend orientated and to give late submissions time to accumulate votes, as per community suggestions. This gives everyone time to prepare builds for Week 4 if they need more time and quick builders can compete on week one.*


**Rules**

* We will post a separate post for each week so contestants can link their entries in the comments. Sometimes they can get buried quickly off the front page.
* A screenshot of the landscape before the build is required to be entered into the contest.
* Development photos would be appreciated. 
* Must be created on Xbox. 
* Must be something you created. (building partners are fine). One split screen screenshot would be appreciated.
* Early Submissions will not be accepted.
* Pixel Art will not be accepted.
* You can only win once a month.
* Please submit your entries at /r/Minecraft360
* Everyone who participates in this week's contest gets the diamond ore flair!
* Please submit your entries with the [WBC] tag.
* You may post your creation in the comments below, but votes will only count in your [WBC] submission. It is smart to advertise your entry here, as it is possible that your post gets buried or off the front page.
* Creative builds are allowed.
* And don't forget to tell people about the contest, the more the merrier!

I wasn't expecting anything in particular with this when I hit create. 

Anyways, you spawn in the south eastern region near a village that sits right where a plains and ice plains biome meet. There are lots of big hills where you start. This means lots of animals that wander into the snowy area. Easy living if you prefer snowy places. The most southern center end houses a swamp biome with the entire south western region being desert. The desert contains a tiny village consisting of 2 houses. From the desert, go north and you'll hit a large, thick forest. Just beyond that is a mix of more plains and extreme hills. The very northern center end has a very small Taiga biome, and the whole north eastern portion is a mix of plains and hills. The very north eastern corner houses a very small oddball desert biome with snow on one end of it. However, the very best part is that in the very center of the map sits a single small island, which is a mushroom biome. 

There are several deep holes and cave entrances dotted all over the map, with the north western extreme hills area being the most striking. There's a very beautiful eye-shaped archway in one of the hills, with another hanging down like a giant stalactite. There's also a large crevice that splits through this area in one spot. This map is claustrophobic, in a good way. 

I know of one partly abandoned mineshaft that I broke down into when I was digging a quarry. It had 3 branches going off it. Two of them were dead ends, and the third had water flowing into it that I haven't explored fully yet. With all of the entrances dotted around the map, I know there's a lot more I haven't found yet.

We decided to use my girlfriend's name.

Seed: Natalya

Spawns you in an extreme hills biome next to a tree. Waterfalls and Lavafalls make the scenery look B-E-A-utiful. Zombie Spawner within walking distance (exposed). Skeleton Spawner just across the water (exposed). Village close by, with a plains biome next to it. EXTREMELY FLAT LAND TO BUILD ON! Abandoned mineshaft with two cave spider spawners close to each other. Stronghold close to spawn.

Sorry, i don't have coordinates until a bit later. I'll upload coordinates when I write them all down.

I don't get any karma for this post, so please upvote for visibility. I really think this seed is amazing. I want everybody to see this!

Update:
Zombie Spawner

Skelton spawner

Just saves us having loads of posts saying ""i found this"" - Instead we could have one post with that we can edit as we go along, so that it's all in one place?

**Hidden Chests**

* In the the huge floating MINECRAFT logo, there is a hidden chest with a full set of Diamond armour and a record - ""Strad"" (*Jay Malkavian and LinuxMage*)

* There is a secret chest down the well of the village that the first minecart leads to (*jhowa182*)

* There is a secret chest in the village's cobblestone tower, the small village to the left of the large one (*jhowa182*)

* There is a secret chest in the stronghold in the mountain, in a little nook by the hidden nether portal, as well as another chest next to the main bedroom in there. (*ForGlory99*)

* You know that little building you pass through when you are done with the tutorial? The one with the chest in it with a bow? Yeah, go outside, turn around, and in one of the windows of the little building there is a chest is a music disc. (*ForGlory99*)

**Record Locations**

* ""Strad"" - Found in the chest that is on the giant MINECRAFT logo that floats above the spawn point. (*Jay Malkavian and LinuxMage*)

**Secrets**

* Found a Nether Portal behind some stone in the castle like cave, not to far from the starting village. (*Jay Malkavian and LinuxMage*)

**Geographical finds/secrets**

* Found a village in the desert - Co-ordinates X:110, Y:66, Z:275 (*Jay Malkavian and LinuxMage*)

* Found a desert Village not to far from the village at the starting point. Co ordinates - X:160 Y:70 Z:-221 (*Jay Malkavian and LinuxMage*)

The spawn point was on a teeny tiny island way up on top of the map. No trees or other land, I was about to quit and delete the seed but I thought it might be fun to try a survival island-type playthrough. There was a cow and a sheep on the island, so I pummeled the cow with my bare fists until it collapsed into a pile of meat: 3 steaks. I would have to eat them raw, but I figured it would last me until I found an island with more to offer. Punched some grass for seeds and walked to shore.

So I swam. There was a mushroom island nearby, but I didn't have any bowls to make stew with, so that was no help. So I swam. And swam. Swam a bit further. Continued to swim. Swam. Swum. And finally, I swam some more.

I was about ready to call it quits again, I was way on the opposite side of the map, no sign of land anywhere. I'm not even sure how I made it that long. My hunger didn't seem to be dropping - maybe it doesn't drop while you're swimming? Anyway a desert island appeared. Nothing immediately useful but it gave me a little hope. And then I saw it! One single, smallish tree in the distance. Now it was getting dark and my hunger was finally falling. I quickly punched the tree into logs, and luckily got a sapling in the process. Planted it and started digging in the ground with my bare hands in the dark praying I wouldn't get jumped by a zombie.

Dug a tiny cave and sealed it off. Whew! Safety! Even if I was starving, alone in the dark, I was alive! Looked at my inventory: 4 logs, 2 steaks, 3 seeds and some dirt. It would be close, but I could actually survive if I was smart!

I made a crafting table and a wooden pickaxe. I couldn't even light up the area yet so I mined down in the dark. After getting some cobble I made a stove and sacrificed a precious piece of wood to make a piece of charcoal to cook the steaks. Made a stone pickaxe and wooden hoe. Tunnelled down and found some iron and a seam of coal. Brought it all up and started melting down the ore and made some torches.

Made a hole and peeked outside: still dark. So I went back down the mine and got a whole bunch of iron and coal.

In the morning, popped out to see that the tree had grown and that there was a small herd of delicious-looking cows on the island, as well as some fluffy sheep. I realized, I had made it! Against all odds I found the only tree on the map and had a supply of food. Success!

So first things first, I needed to get a garden going and fence up the cows. Chopped down the tree and got 3 more seedlings. Made a little garden next to shore and went down into my excavated space. Looked at my inventory to see if I had enough wood to make a chest and then with no warning whatsoever BOOM a creeper blew me to bits.

Stared at the screen. All my inventory scattered. My little hovel destroyed. Continue or quit to title?

I had to quit. That was just way too painful.

If anyone else wants to give it a try... The seed is 5432. The single tree (as far as I could see) is on a small island way on the bottom right of the map. Good luck!",,False,self,t5_2tjtf,False,,,True,t3_1fhsjb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft360/comments/1fhsjb/ouch/,

OneRandomCatFact (*A group of cats is called a “clowder.”*) has brought to my attention that we don't have a prize set up for the WBC! It slipped my mind.

Now, I have a problem. I'm flat broke. No money for Steam games, Farmville (hah), or Microsoft Points. I'd love to get you guys MC Points, but I honestly can't.

But we need a prize! So if you guys have any ideas or suggestions, please put them in the comments below. I'll take a look and choose the best ones. 

I'll edit this as we get more comments.

So there I was mining, I had 4 diamonds, and 1 and a half stacks of iron ore. I walked into another section of my cave, and there was a giant slime. In my mind, I said ""Hey bro!"" ( I was wearing the slime skin from the Birthday skin pack, I love slimes). I am a redstoner, so I attempted to kill the giant, lovable, squishy, green, beast for it's slime balls. As I attacked it, I was knocked to a pit of lava, with 4 diamonds. I screamed, in my head, ""RAGEQUIT!"" Then as if my love for slimes saved me, the slime jumped in the lava with me, and pushed me out. Luckily, I was about to die of burning to death, but I had a bucket of water in my hot bar. It wasn't over then though! The giant slime jumped out, and died, splitting into 4 medium sized slimes. I hadn't regenerated my hearts yet, so I managed to kill one. Then with 1 heart, I trapped myself in a cobblestone tube. I ended up regenerating all my hearts, killed all the slimes, and walked away with 4 diamonds and 19 slimeballs

**Forgive me if there are any mistakes.  Long time lurker, first time poster.**

This was Phase 1 of my winter break project with my brother.  This was our first big project with Minecraft 360 and we're pretty happy with it.  We have plans to add a downed at-at when we have some more time.  We needed to have it all cramped together to make sure the draw distance could catch a good portion of our work.  I kinda like it super close anyway :D  We also chose to leave the natural land in place and only make changes when necessary.  

Phase 2 will consist of building echo base itself.  Hanger, more snowspeeders, machinery, command room, Millenium Falcon, etc etc.

Let me know what you think! ^begentle

This raises the obvious question, what plans (if any yet) do Mojang/4J have to bring Minecraft to the next gen?

Obviously the 360 will continue to be supported, probably for the next two years at least; but with Minecraft being as ever-growing and changing as it is, the platform will eventually fall apart around the program, and they will have to move on.

Anyone care to speculate? Will Minecraft: One Edition show up within a year or two of launch? Will we see two versions updated simultaneously, or will 4J (assuming they'll be the ones to carry the torch) focus primarily on one or the other?

I've  got a first home built (7x7x4 cobblestone, trapdoor below to mineshaft and trapdoor above to roof), hit the jackpot on a quite the coal deposit, and am pretty much safe from all monsters.

Here are the questions:
  -creepers.  Do they ever go away?  If not, how to I effectively defeat them?

  -there was an option upon creating the world that said something about 'strongholds/villages will form.'  When exactly does that happen?

  -what should be my next objectives?  Any tips or warnings would be greatly appreciated!

  -how do I join other players worlds?

  -where can I find rarer minerals?  Just look around for mines and dig around?

Anyways, I'm on US Central time zone, get off work usually around 4-5 PM, off work on weekends.  GT is same as username 'ChronDonDiggity.'  If anybody wants to show me around a little or doesn't mind playing with a newbie, add me!



Edit:  Thank you all so very much!  I won't lie, I was a little scared I was gonna get greeted by 'gtfo noob' or whatever.

I don't get karma for it I just need it to be seen.*

MinecraftXbox and XboxMinecraft have set the official cut off date to this subreddit, /r/Minecraft360, for Sept 8th. This is to give members of both groups plenty of time to transition over and work out any problems with the subreddit. You'll notice a few new skin flair is available over here as well. MinecraftXbox and XboxMinecraft will still be usable until then but keep in mind we will be transferring over to Minecraft360 at that date then MinecraftXbox and XboxMinecraft will become ""Read-only"". Apologies for any inconvenience during this transition.

How this will effect the WBC I'm not entirely sure yet. I'd say keep Week 1 on /r/MinecraftXbox. Otherwise it will be delayed a week.

Thanks everyone who has helped push us towards the merge. It's been a long, long, loooooooooongggggggggg process but it seems like we're finally at the end of it. 

To the future of the Minecraft Xbox reddit community!!! &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

I posted this in response and /u/johannz asked that I post it as a text submission.  All the links derived from /r/Minecraft and if you aren't subscribed there, I highly recommend you do so along with this one.  Both are excellent sources for inspiration and advice and the user base is very friendly and helpful for the most part.  

Here's some patterns and combinations courtesy of the users of /r/Minecraft:

Note: These are just floor patterns, but they do a good job of showcasing which blocks work best together and they offer a few appealing design techniques.

For some really good aesthetic advice and examples, try this out:

http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/comments/qmndk/the_gigantic_guide_for_building/

The guide is designed for PC users, but most of the designs are achievable on Xbox.

Remember, there is no wrong way to accomplish things in Minecraft. Everything created is subjective artistically and it ultimately comes down to what you, as the player, hope to achieve. 

Edit: Made a few grammatical changes and took out unecessary info.

Edit 2:  I'd also like to add that if you ever have any questions or are seeking constructive criticism, don't hesitate to ask (as long as it abides by the rules of the subreddit).  You may recieve downvotes, but since I joined this subreddit, I've seen very few questions go unanswered, but don't be discouraged by downvotes!

I don't have the money to be giving out gold or anything at the moment. 

Im thinking of a monthly build off. Today, May 1st, till May 7th will be sign ups. Send a PM with the subject ""Monthly build challenge"" if you want to join. I will have a max of 8 people per month. On the 7th i will release the first build, then every few days i will add a new object to build. I will get the message out to players via email or pm so they will be able to see it asap. Now if you are the 9th person who signs up, dont worry, i will give you first dibs on the next challenge, and i can use you guys for ideas. 

Now the rules:

--This must be in creative or survival (if you really want a challenge)

--this must be on a brand new world, so there cannot be any other builds besides what I put for the challenge

--Please do this by yourself. I want to see what you guys are capable of. There is no real prize at the moment, so I don't see the need to cheat

I will be putting up updates on the subreddit, so if you want your builds to be included in the update, send me a link to the album and I'll include it. 

I am going to be starting a YouTube channel with my friends, so I might put your builds up on a YouTube video to show off what you guys can do. 

If you're interested send me a PM with:
Your name
Gamertag
And email

I really hope I can start something new here. So the May challenge begins.

I've noticed *alot* of *really* vague self posts that don't do anything to add to the quality of this sub and really clog up the front page since we are such a small community.  When you post here, you are automatically on the front page- meaning someone who is visiting the subreddit for the first time may only get to see a bunch of posts asking for a seed or posting a seed, a ton of [LFP] and probably a post or two asking about an update to the game.


Now I understand that these are all legitimate questions, it just seems to me that the redundancy of these posts could drive people away. I find myself looking at it less and less because of it as well. 

Like I said, I may be alone in thinking this, and if that is the case, the downvote arrow is to the left. 


I don't think I'd mind some of the posts if they weren't so vague, but people asking for a ""good seed"" or ""I'm making a city, help"" just isn't very engaging content.

However, I do understand Redstone fairly well and I wish to impart how I learned Redstone.

* first skim the [wiki page](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Redstone_Circuits), alot of the information here will go over a new users head, but will provide general knowledge
* watch some tutorials on basic circuits (I recommend [CNBMinecraft](http://www.youtube.com/user/CNBMinecraft) and [EthosLabs](http://www.youtube.com/user/EthosLab) )
* copy along with the tutorial on a superflat map leaving signs making notes on parts of the circuit explaining why it works
* build the circuits from memory as best you can, feel free to look at your note signs on the already built ones as needed
* then try your luck building your own basic circuits, regardless of efficiency, using your knowledge
* finally build some slightly advanced ones (seven digit displays, piston doors, locks, and the like) and label the circuits with signs (e.g. ""hey this it's an AND gate, Block switcher, etc)

After doing all this you should have a somewhat understanding of Redstone contraptions and be able to recognize the circuits used in tutorials without them even mentioning. From here you can start constructing your own inventions and who knows you could be the next Etho!

1352874193.0,32,self.Minecraft360,1364c8,I've had a lot of fun running a server the last few days   and witnessed a lot of hilarity.  I wanna hear about other peoples unique experiences.,CordouroyStilts,38,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft360/comments/1364c8/ive_had_a_lot_of_fun_running_a_server_the_last/,"So I started a server sometime last week and posted my GT on reddit and the minecraftforum.  It was no rules survival and I got probably 20-30 unique players altogether.  Anyways, here is my experience so far...

     When I started the server I know that because of the 'anything goes' rules, most if not all players would be
looking to gank my shit.  My first thought was to build underground and keep a very hidden entrance and operate
from down there.  I mined down to diamond territory with my partners and we built a very nice underground farm
and kept all of our best stuff in a chest hidden behind a random block.
  
     This was good for awhile, but it wasn't long before I was surprised by someone attacking me from behind
while opening a chest.  We'll call him ""Bubsy"".  He had found me on his map and just dug straight down into our 
base.  He killed me, but my bed was only a few feet away and I spawned and was able to kill him.  I was the
victor!  And I had a new set of armor and random goodies thanks to my fallen enemy.  He kept coming though. 
He knew where our base was and knew our treasure was somewhere.  We decided we had to move.  We stripped
that place of everything of value, set fire to our farm and hit the road.

     We walked until we hit the far corner of the map and started building a castle on an ice island with the 
endless amounts of cobblestone we had acquired from living underground.  We thought being on an island in a 
corner it would be easy to keep from being snuck up on(gamertags and health bar aren't visible on my server).  
We were wrong.  We were found and attacked a few times by Bubsy, but never lost our big haul.  Then another
character found our base and snuck up behind my friend who was looking in a chest.  He was able to dump a 
bucket of lava on the ground behind my friend before he knew he was even there.  It killed him and burned up his
supplies, also filling our main room with lava and setting fire to the house.  I was upstairs but couldnt go down 
and attack because the stairs were blocked with lava.  In the meantime, the vandal was looting our chests!!!! 
(luckily the good stuff was hidden very well).  

     Our location was compromised yet again.  We would have to find a better way to survive.  We packed up our
things again and set out for a hopefully safer base.  My friend had the idea of a ""skybase"" floating in the air with
a waterfall for an elevator.  This seemed like the safest way. 

     While exploring a nearby village I found that someone had set up a living space in one of the smaller, off to 
the side houses.  I opened the chest and it was PACKED.  Mostly with non-exciting things but it had a few 
diamond and a DIAMOND SWORD that I was pretty sure once belonged to me.  Bubsy had taken one from me 
during one of his attacks, and I hadn't seen anyone else with one yet.  I grabbed anything that would leave a 
sting on Bubsy and took it home.  Brimming with the feeling of victory again.

     Later I had spotted a player wandering the coastline near our 'skybase' who clearly saw our structure, but
didn't approach us.  He just turned around and headed back the way he came.  I knew he'd return.  One of my 
partners was out collecting cobblestone when I spotted the same player wandering the coastline again abount 20
minutes later.  He was wearing armor this time and digging up a lot of dirt.  I assumed that the dirt was to build
straight up and infiltrate our base.  This could not happen.

     My partner was near him and hadn't been seen.  I could see everything from my lookout tower like a perched
eagle ready to strike.  My partner was going to attack before being seen but had no supplies.  (We are paranoid 
and don't leave the base with anything we don't need).  I called him near and was able to throw him down my 
sword from the highest point possible for building on Minecraft360.  He retrieves it and slays this man who was 
still digging around in the dirt.  My friend returned to the base with Iron armor and 64 Iron ore.  We knew he'd be
back, haha.  

     It was literally the next in-game morning that him and another player came strolling up to investigate the 
island under our base.  We jumped down to make our kill and both players started to flee on boats.  We quickly 
made boats and started chasing them.  My partner caught his suspect quick and killed him while mine was still a
ways ahead of me.  I fired 2 arrows at him, but missed wildly.  The third arrow was a direct hit and broke his 
boat out from under him.  Now my partner and I circled him in our boats like sharks.  We tried herding him to land
for a bit but lost interest.  I jumped off my boat and attacked him in the ocean.  Swimming to the bottom to 
collect my loot.  Our base still yet to be contested.

     Today I started up the server and saw that Bubsy had joined.  I thought, ""He probably doesn't know we 
moved bases yet.  It would be funny to go leave signs around the old base that were noted to him when he 
comes to attack us again.""  I made four signs and headed off on my boat.  When I got there I saw a dog sitting 
in our main room.  ""Did you leave a dog behind when we moved?""  I ask my girlfriend.  It was then that Bubsy
came down the stairs and killed me!  Had he taken over our old base?

     Later while exploring, a companion and I did find a secret mine under one of Bubsys suspected structures.  No
big haul, but we did find some gold in a furnace.

     Eventually I made it back to the original spawn area and saw that it had been blown to hell by creepers.  I 
loaded in creative and built a nice bedrock ""New player hut"" and a farm to get people started with food.  I also 
took the opportunity to hide some treasure in some fun ways around the map.  A sphinx in the desert filled with
treasure, an obsidian skull on a mountain-face with treasure in his mouth, marked graves scattered around the 
map filled with bones, slime and useful items, plus more.

     The battle rages with the enemies we've gained but most people keep coming back and seem to play as often
as I do!(which is almost constantly).  and Bubsy even messaged me to tell me he found 2 treasures.  He must be
having as much, if not more fun than me and I hope he gets back on tomorrow to stir things up a bit.  Anyways,
we are hunting the more established players and having a great time defending our skybase....which has yet to 
be breached!  



Now tell me Minecraft360ers, What memorable experiences have you had?  I hope this wasn't too long, lol

The xbox will run constantly except for maintenance. It will be running survival mode and is open to everyone. The first week will be played on easy followed by a week of normal and then a hard for the rest of the time it is up. I am thinking every 3 months we can change the seed but that’s up in the air at the moment.


My GT is minecrafth0st due to the high demand I won't be manually sending friend requests from this point on. However I will be accepting all friend requests sent from here on out until my friends list is full. Feel free to send me a friend request. This is also the party you should join when you enter the game.

Also I am sure most of you know this but there can only be 8 people in the game at one time. If the game appears offline its not. 

We will be making a PVP arena In the near future on the map. Until then please don't kill other players. If you are caught you will be kicked

For those of you who can't get in you can see whats happening on the live stream here http://www.twitch.tv/cajun1689

Could be more but I haven't finished exploring the whole mineshaft yet, as I said.  Also, if you haven't run into cave spiders yet, be careful!  Come prepared because they will rape you.  Good luck!

(note the capitalization)

Summary: This map is made up of close to 50/50 water to land split, with a lot of really picturesque coastal land. It has a nice mixture of both rolling hills and flat land, as well as ""epic"" mountain formation elevations. Two mushroom biomes and one village are available. Overall, a nice mix of the good stuff!

Here's a grid style breakdown. Imagine the map split into 9 squares, like a crafting recipe, and I'll describe the main geography per square, thus:

    1 2 3
    4 5 6
    7 8 9

Think of squares 1,2,4, and 5 as sea, surrounded on  the right and bottom by land...

1. Almost entirely sea with one small island &amp; Tree.
2. Mostly sea with a few medium chain islands.
3. Mostly very tall mountains, several valleys with cool scenic views. The mountain terrain from area 3 spills into the sea with cool cliffs.  
4. Mostly sea with a medium mushroom biome island.
5. Mostly sea with another medium mushroom biome island, spotted at least one mooshroom. also coastline for area 6.
6. Mostly land, majority forest, but also some mountain and swamp area plus snow biome.
7. Very large island with medium to gently rolling hills and flat area. Contains a village.
8. 50/50 land water with land being mostly swamp and a little snow biome
9. Mostly land with almost all snow forest.

Hope you like it!

I've since fixed up the four villages: replaced gravel for cobblestone for the roads (connecting the two sister cities), fixing any deformities in their houses, fencing off farm land and making gates (to keep trespassers from ruining crops), even building a train to connect the villages north and south.

The four villages are named New Dunlap, Ravine, Portsmouth, and Wells Hollow. Ravine is aptly named because it sits atop a very large ravine. One villager's house actually has a basement that opens into the ravine. Wells Hollow is named because it sits atop a large cave system so the ground underneath many of the houses are hollow. Portsmouth is a seaside village and I built a dock for boats. New Dunlap is the biggest village so far and is a bustling metropolis.

The problem is, everyone seems to require a mic to join.  I honestly prefer the silence, and communicating through signs and head nods.  In a way, it immerses me in the world more, and I don't have to worry about the age or gender of the people I'm playing with, or if we have anything in common to talk about.

I have read countless ""1000 Things to Do in Minecraft"" but they all devolve into madness relatively soon. I was inspired by the To-Do Board that /u/AdventLife posted and so I have decided to start a list.

Please feel free to add suggestions in the comments and I will add them to this list as things for me to strive to accomplish as well as a resource for others.

**To-Do List:**

- Giant Tree (treehouse optional)
- Open, lit, and cleared mineshafts
- Mine (grip, branch, etc (check out [this guide](http://www.voxelwiki.com/minecraft/Elites_of_Minecraft:_The_Miner) for ideas)
- Mob Grinder (Cave spider, blaze, and skeleton are the biggest priorities for me)
- Nether Portal
- Netherbase including Netherwart farm
- Livestock farm (cows, chickens, and sheep are most important) (be sure to dye some of your sheep for easy access to colored wool without using and obscene amount of dye).
- Produce farm (wheat, melon, pumpkins, sugarcane, and cacti)
- Crafting Center (furnace, crafting table, enchanting room, brewing stations)
- Redstone testing center (so much more useful than I would have once thought)
- Well decorated base
- Another base for no apparent reason
- Storage center
- Easy and safe access to the End portal
- Slay the Enderdragon
- Build a shrine to the dragon egg
- Garden
- Minecart hub with rail system
- Automation of things (this could be as simple as standing on a pressure plate to collect sugarcane (not TRULY automatic but close enough for our purposes until 360 gets hoppers))
- Series of docks for easy transit since 360 maps are surrounded by water
- Collection of well enchanted gear
- Castle perhaps
- Pyramid
- Town or City (Could be an expansion of a Testificate Village)
- Hidden storage for valuables such as diamonds, cakes, and enchanted gear
- XP Grinder (Blaze if you can because each Blaze gives 10 XP as opposed to the usual 5 for a hostile mob but Cave Spiders can bve effective due to the possibility of finding multiple spawners in usable proximity)
- Renevated Stronghold (This is a long process if you have a large Stronghold and the Silverfish are a pain but I have set up a nice base there and it becomes rather cozy.) 
- Rooster Teeth Tower of Pimps?
- Stadium for Your Favorite Sport
- Upgraded NPC Village (Fortify with walls and turrets, replace materials with better ones (cobblestone with stone brick for example), add new buildings, improve farming, improve paths, add market, etc.)
- Underwater Base
- Insane Redstone Contraptions (/u/UsefulStatement suggested checking out Etho's Pet Project Wilson (Episode 248+))
- Statues
- Self-Sustaining Base (as much as possible)
- Gold Farm
- Iron Farm
- Theme Park (roller coasters are a must)
- Library (better if editable books come out)
- Arena for PvP
- Arena for fighting mobs
- Towers
- Sorted storage area

second I hate having to go to a certain room to use my crafting bench, so i end up with crafting benches all over the place and they rarely match my decor. so BOOM! floor block swapper, hit a button and your floor block swaps with a crafting bench (or really any other block, i use glowstone in the tutorial)

For a US History project, my class is reading the Wizard of Oz. Starting Friday, we have a week to ""recreate Oz"", connecting it to American history and such. We can recreate it in any medium. My friend and I joking brought up making it in Minecraft, since we both enjoy the game. We started talking about it, and we think it might end up being a really good idea.

Our teacher really wants us to wow her with new ways of expressing Oz. She wants to see something new. So, my friend and I want to create a superflat and start a massive, week-long build for this school project. This would be on the 360 version since I don't have access to the PC one. 

Now, this isn't exactly just building a fantasy world. We have to do things like representing Glinda the good witch as Northern sympathizers during the the American Civil War, the wizard as President McKinley, Toto as a prohibitionist, and Dorothy as the American people, plus so much more. This will be kind of complicated.

I'll also be posting to /r/minecraft for visibility.

My questions are these: do you guys think this is a good idea? Also, would anyone be interested in helping us out a little?",,False,self,t5_2tjtf,False,,sheep,True,t3_19s0ta,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft360/comments/19s0ta/school_project_needs_to_be_creative/,

So I tried Minecraft on the PC long ago and never played it more than a few minutes.  Tried the demo on the 360 and thought I might buy it on sale.  I just never gave it the time.  Then it came out on disc and I grabbed it.  I've been playing ever since.  And this was my first map (still playing it but have tried a couple others I've seen posted).

It has a good variety of biomes, mine shaft, two villages, and a multi level dungeon with end portal and library.  There is also a mushroom island that sits off the coast.  I haven't used the portal yet because I just recently went back and realized what it was.

-18, 65, 231

I built a temporary home here and started digging.  What I fell into soon after I had no idea existed.  

Dungeon:
7,29,176

Be careful here because I got lucky falling in at this point.  There is a wall that separates you from a very deep ravine.  So it's a bonus once you navigate to the bottom.  Multi level, library, end portal, spider spawner.  I had hell getting out only having played an hour or so.  So imagine a virgin miner falling into this darkness right away.

Zombies: 
-53, 60, 23 ( The saddle is in a chest in the zombie room)

I built my home not far from here into the side of the cliff before I found this.  See the map picture for location.  There is a small village that can be seen from here that had seeds in a chest.  (if the seeds aren't there, then it's the other village but I think this is it)

The second village is near the north west corner just north of where the snow ends.  You will also find a large ravine, this is where the mine shaft is.  I also found some easy diamonds at one end of the ravine but didn't start noting them yet.  They are on the surface when you get to the bottom.

There is a lone island in the south east corner that is all mushroom and mooshroom.

The rest is diamond entries I've saved.  If you find anything else good, I'd like to know.  I've pretty much dug everywhere except the north east mountain but I haven't found much there yet.

Diamonds:

So - i ran some (not very comprehensive) tests on a superflat world - no structures.

***

First: i managed to spawn 90 sheep. - had to clear the area like 5 times to remove all natural spawns... but i ended up with 90 sheep.

switched to chickens - spawned 19 - mob limit msg.

switched to wolves - spawned 26 - mob limit msg.

switched to mooshrooms - spawned 10 - mob limit msg.

switched to villagers - spawned 20 - mob limit msg.

so, somehow at this point i have 165.

***

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the mooshrooms and tried to spawn cows - 0.

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the wolves and tried cows - 0.

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the villagers and tried cows - 0.

checked the area - no natural spawns

killed the chickens and tried cows - 0.

check the area - no natural spawns

killed 10 sheep - tried cows - got 10.

***

i continued to kill sheep in tens and spawned cows in tens and the limit seemed to stay at 90 as it would only let me spawn the same number as i killed... checked the area 1 last time - 10 chickens spawned naturally somewhere along the line that i must have missed.

so, i'm thinking that it's around 100 - but there may be partial caps that are shared among certain mobs that allow for exceptions... but that would require much more testing than i have the patience for.

has anyone else tried something similar to verify / disprove these findings?

edit: i also went to the furthest point away from my inhumane mob farm and tried to spawn more after getting the limit message - NOPE. so it's a global limit not based on what's in the vicinity.",,False,self,t5_2tjtf,1366059648.0,,slime,True,t3_1ceit9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft360/comments/1ceit9/passive_mob_limit_observations/,
