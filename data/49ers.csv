Why does he have to be so arrogant about it? Why can't he win with class? I didn't know where else to post this, I just had to vent it somewhere.

The /r/49ers mods would like to thank all the donors that made the CrowdTilt.com campaign a huge success! You guys are what makes this subreddit so great!

Thanks to your help, we were able to hit our target amount of $545 which is the amount required to purchase the premium 8""x8"" red logo brick. We have already placed the order and received a confirmation receipt that says ""Message: Approved"".

As you know, we are going to keep the text simple and it will just read: ""/r/49ers"". We tried to place the text on the lower lines (2nd or 3rd) but the simulated brick always had it in the top line spot. Ultimately, we placed the text in the 3rd line slot, so we'll see if they space it appropriately.

Some other relevant info/small text sent to us in the confirmation receipt:

""You will receive an Inscription Verification letter within 3-4 weeks of your order being approved. Please verify that your order and personal inscription are accurate within the proof time indicated on your letter. Replica bricks and display cases are expected to be engraved and shipped within 10-12 weeks of your order being approved.""

Thanks to /u/will650, we were also able to apply a 10% off promo code which brought the order total to $543.31 (after tax).

**PIGSKIN PICKEM LEAGUE**

As previously discussed, we'll give away the replica brick to the winner of the Pigskin Pickem league. Once Pickem season starts and we are able to set up the league, we will use the email you used with crowdtilt to notify you and to send an invite.

Follow these steps from your computer;

* Get a VPN; I use [PIA](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/), they're good. There are other even cheaper providers, I've always used PIA and they're very reliable and fast.

* Set up your VPN and connect to a Netherlands IP (super easy to do with PIA, just select Netherlands from the connection menu).

* Go to gamepass.nfl.com

* Enjoy ~ You can obviously hook your machine up to your TV and watch it that way too.

You can test this right now, test it and you should be able to watch the NFL Network right now.

It obviously is only a small section of your overall fandom, but I haven't seen a single hateful comment (helps that you won the game, but still :) ) which is always impressive.

Alex Smith created a program called the Alex Smith Guardian Scholars Foundation-I am one of the last remaining cohorts in the program. It is because of Alex and his family's investment in the program that I received a full ride to college, mentorship, and the ability to pursue something I didn't have the resources for. He has spent thousands from his own pocket on young adults he had never met, students who just wanted an opportunity. I will graduate from SDSU with 2 majors in 2014, and it is thanks to Alex. With the turbulence of the team, it is unsure if the program will continue, but the Guardian Scholars program is one which is being implemented and expanded on across the nation in other Universities, as it has a phenomenal success rate. It is truly unfortunate to hear about the drama happening with the 49ers(I hear some of it from the Smiths personally), and I wish him nothing but the best. He is one remarkable man, and deserves nothing but success.

1347415654.0,145,self.49ers,zqt1h,For those of you worried about extending Bowman,derekre3,161,16,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/zqt1h/for_those_of_you_worried_about_extending_bowman/,"Some of you may know this, other may not. 

Patrick Willis' deal was set to average $10 mil a year in salary until 2016. Thinking that they would have the cap space this season, the 49ers restructured it and made his cap figure for this year $17 million, almost double the next highest paid 49er (Alex Smith). They basically decided to pay his entire signing bonus this year instead of spreading it out. 

This allows his contract to be more reasonable down the road. His cap figure next season? $3.5 million. It does go up from there, however. Here's what it looks like:

2012: $17.5 mil

2013: $3.5 mil

2014: $6.4 mil 

2015: $8.7 mil

2016: $9 mil 

There may be room for Bowman after all. They could choose to tear up the last year of Bowman's deal (he's scheduled to make $805k) and sign him to a new deal that is front-loaded in the 2013 season. 

Another less popular method would be to cut Frank Gore after this season :(. I'm not saying this is Gore's last productive season, but if it came down to keeping Bowman or Gore, I'd take Bowman. Kendall Hunter should be ready to take over and they picked LaMichael James in the 2nd round for a reason.

*Bargaining - We can just see how this Kaepernick thing goes and once he starts having trouble we can always go back to Smith! Right?

*Depression - Look at Alex Smith over there on the sideline with his helmet on like he's gonna go in at any moment, every touchdown makes me cheer until they inevitably show Smith over there with that destroyed look on his face. He's wearing the helmet to hear the calls, not to hide his tears!

We, the /r/49ers mods, are trying to figure out whether we want to go ahead and buy a brick to represent /r/49ers for the new Levis Stadium. The website to order bricks is here:

https://www.brickorder.com/lsfanwalk/promo.html

There are multiple bricks to choose from. But, for our purposes, we're thinking about starting with the least expensive brick, a Plaza Gold 4x8 brick that is priced at $195.00. With it, we get three lines of text which can't exceed 15 characters per line.

But, if interest is high enough and enough funds are collected, we will attempt to purchase a larger brick with more lines of text, or, alternatively, we will purchase multiple bricks. If only 200 of you donate $1, we will have enough for one brick. All donations will go directly toward the purchase of the brick(s). 

We don't want to make this decision ourselves, so we're opening it up to you guys. Do you want us to buy a brick to represent /r/49ers? What inscription would you like on the brick? What size brick do you want?

One of the mods will accept donations in a later thread through WePay or Google Wallet after we determine the level of interest and what we're going to inscribe on the brick. Please make your voice heard below. Thank you!

EDIT: Grammar

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the interest. We have started a CrowdTilt campaign.

17 years on, the sting isn't that our record was blemished. It comes down to one (or two) single plays.

For us, we rallied back like you guys did. Neil O'Donnell had a timing pattern to our 6th WR. He ran the wrong pattern.

We stupidly called the same play again with our final chance.

He ran the wrong pattern **again**. 

The thing that stings is that we had the game in-hand. The momentum was ours. But we made critical coaching mistakes. You don't throw a timing route to a guy who doesn't practice with the QB. How can there be timing or chemistry?

That was a hard loss to swallow because it was there.

Tonight you have Crabtree and Jimmy Smith. The #1 WR vs the 5th DB for the Ravens. One you should win. But there was no holding call. 

Here's the rub: those refs weren't calling anything. You have to adjust what you do. 

9 years later, Cowher finally got his shot again and won that 5th SB. In the meantime, we got used to ""you know making it and being that close still counts for something"" and you learn from it.

This makes Jim a better coach. Would you trade 1 loss for a couple wins? This team is good. He won't make this mistake again. The 49ers are young and have a bright future ahead of them. This is all part of the learning experience. 

It's going to suck ass to think about the non-call, but I want to help you get over it: they were not going to all of a sudden start calling that holding or PI when they established that was ok the entire game. It was a mistake. Maybe it was Colin, maybe it was Jim - I don't know. I'm sure Jim will take the blame. But it's one you'll learn from and it will lead to future success. 

I'm confident this loss is going to lead to more wins in the future. It's going to make guys hungry and appreciate it. It's one people are going to question and no one will make that mistake again. 

After we lost, we went on to appear in 3 more SBs and won 2 of them. Anyway, you guys have a hell of a team and like the Pats, you're going to be knocking on the door every year.",,False,,t5_2rebv,False,,nfc,True,t3_17ui3a,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/17ui3a/51_isnt_as_bad_as_you_think/,

1. You can say Kaep fucked up massively with that bad pitch, which is true. **But why were we running an option?** Our priority should be ball security in that situation and our line had only blocked well on power plays all day, so why run that? Terrible play call.

2. The play calling was terrible all day in general. We ran maybe one screen when they were killing our line, ran that jumbo package crap consistently even though it never works. Harbuagh clearly played for a FG in OT even though Akers has sucked all year! That 3rd and 6 run only gained 2 yards, why not at least try for the 1st?

3. We dominate their offense all day, but when we need to keep them from getting a FG at the end of the game we decide to drop into a deep zone and at most rush 4 when we haven't touched Bradford all day. So what if a stupid penalty gave them 15? They had a free 8 yards each play anyway.

Did certain people play like shit today (OLine, Delaney)? Yes. Did Kaep have a rough day? Yes.

But once again Harbuagh and the coaching staff failed to make adjustments to the same problems we have had all year. Would we have won if we played Smith? Perhaps. 

But why the fuck are people jumping off the CK bandwagon and back onto Smiths dick when the line and the coaches failed him? I didn't want Smith to get benched for CK but don't sit there and pretend this game was solely on Kaep when it wasn't at all. He got very little help today, cut him some slack.

**EDIT 1:** A point to add. One major reason why I want people to think about these points is that the poor O Line play and bad play calling have been present in every game this year in which our offense has struggled. The guy playing QB has not been the same in all of those games. If we can't block and the play calling is extremely shady in important situations we will struggle offensively no matter who is under center.",,False,,t5_2rebv,1354503306.0,,ovalsf,True,t3_1462q8,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/1462q8/shut_up_about_kaep_vs_smith_and_place_some_blame/,

It's not a new company that's going to constantly be involved in M&amp;A's and need to change the name of the stadium over and over again. Nobody minds Wrigley Field being Wrigley Field, because that's what it's been for decades, to the point where you almost forget that it's a corporately named park (though granted, the circumstances are a little different).

The second, and the reason I like it even more, is that Levi Strauss got his start selling goods during the Calfornia gold rush.

For anything that could be said about his NFL career, you'd be hard pressed to argue that he hasn't been the face of class and grace through times that would shatter the self-worth of most men. It would be easy to put together something online, but a dignified sendoff in print media seems like a more serious gesture. That said, I've got no idea how much it would cost to get an ad in the Chronicle or Mercury, or if enough people would ever chip in a couple bucks to the cause. I'd love to see some design mockups for ad ideas from y'all, but I'm getting way ahead of myself, and forgetful of how quickly discourse can sour on such a touchy subject. 

edit: I'm completely supporting Kaep at this point and fully understand the monetary reasons why Alex likely won't be here next year. I hadn't considered that this idea would be seen as undermining Kaep, just thought this would be a visible/classy way as a SF fanbase to wish him well on his next career moves. I regret the timing, not the sentiment of my post. It's a downvote shitstorm in here on both sides, it's been a rough couple of weeks on r/49ers resembling ESPN forum infighting.

The Seahawks are *supposed* to be our rivals. We're *supposed* to hate them.

They're in our division, and that's what divisional rivals do, right?

To be honest, for the past 10 years, I have never felt it. I have never considered the Seahawks to be rivals. I have never felt the need to bash a team that did nothing wrong to me. These aren't the Dodgers or anything.

There's a reason for all of this. If you're an old-timey 49ers fan, you would know how non-historic this rivalry is. I mean, seriously, the *AFC West*? The Seahawks joined the NFC in 2002. By the time they settled in, the 49ers dynasty had expired. When Hasselbeck told the official that he wanted the ball, and that ""we're gonna score"", it was all about the Greatest Show on Turf. It wasn't about the 49ers dynasty.

I suspect he'll show up as limited all week in practice while the 49ers try and get him back and healthy for next Sunday's NFC Championship Game. Staley stepped up and gutted it out, which proved pretty key. Since he did not leave the game, we never got an injury status update. I don't imagine much detail from Coach Harbaugh this week, so we'll see if he's listed as anything other than ""limited"" on the injury report later this week.

1347512281.0,87,self.49ers,zt3qy,Harbaugh and the media,turlockmike,102,15,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/zt3qy/harbaugh_and_the_media/,"There's a lot of controversy (specifically from media personalities like Mike Silver) about how Harbaugh treats the media. The media is constantly trying to get an interesting line and create controversy in order to write a story, but Harbaugh doesn't buy into at all and I LOVE IT!

Here are my personal thoughts. Harbaugh is a real coach. He meticulously controls every aspect of the game. He places trust in his coaches and players to do their job and then crafts a strategy which utilizes their strengths and minimizes their weaknesses. His weekly focus is on football. He sleeps, eats and breaths football strategy and has the respect of all the players (as has been said during so many interviews). He never calls out his players in front of the media (unlike someone named Bobby V) and because of that his players treat him with huge respect. 

As far as the media questions, he uses the control of the situation to orchestrate his strategy. Any question which he believes by answering will lower the respect of a player or himself, he simply doesn't answer because that is a part of the recipe of his success. 

The other factor I believe that is going is that he is very uncomfortable answering questions about how he feels. This is because he always says things like ""Our goal each week is to win"" and that's what he's comfortable doing. He doesn't think about his feelings because they would get in the way of his goals. So when someone asks him how he feels about something the question is foreign. He does an analysis of the situation and makes logical decisions. He doesn't go with gut, he goes with percentages (which is a keyword he will use sometimes) and this is why those questions not only are foreign to him, but are annoying. He sees the game of football one way (as a puzzle to solve) and the media sees it as entertainment. 

I believe the only way to get through to Harbaugh is to ask him open ended football questions. You will notice that occasionally he will answer a question and come up with some great quotes, but he has to like the question. I think asking more football questions will help the media get better quotes and to make Harbaugh more ""friendly"".

Some questions I would have asked on sunday if I were a reporter.

1. What do you believe were the key plays in the game?

2. What kind of approach offensively did you use and why was it succesful?

3. What kind of challenges did the Packers present in the game?

4. Who were the key playmakers in the game?

5. Was there any special preperation for the game today?


A few more ""personal feeling"" questions that would probably still get responses (by asking them in a specific manner)


6. How has your confidence in the team grown after today?

7. What lessons do you think you learned from today's game?

8. How was the team morale during the week as you were preparing?

9. Fans like to know a little bit about the coach they admire, could you tell us anything interesting or amusing that happened during the game today?

I am a die-hard Ravens fan, but the Niners are my NFC team and I just want to say how proud I am of both our teams.  

Both teams have been through so much, beginning from both of us losing last year's conference championship games due to stupid mistakes, through injuries and personnel changes this year.  We have both matured as teams and as fans from these hardships, and we have been supportive of each other (I'm generalizing) the whole way.  

The Harbaughs have not only brought intra-organizational unity, but they have also forged a brotherhood between our teams.  This is the beginning of a great legacy. 

This game is the best possible scenario for us.  Ever since Jim Harbaugh became the Head Coach of the 49ers, I have dreamed of a Super Harbrawl.  On Sunday, I will crack open a couple beers and sit down on a couch with some friends who are Niners fans, and bask in all the glory that will unfold. 

Good luck to you. Win or lose, I am so proud of both organizations. Let's hope for a great hour of hard-hitting, smash-mouth football and may the injuries be limited to a minimum.

Everyone asks me why I'm a Niners fan and frankly, I don't know, and I don't care. That's why I begged my boyfriend until he gave in and bought tickets to yesterday's game (he's a Jets fan, but no guy is perfect). I just wanted to let you know what it was like for some of Niners Nation in East Rutherford. 

1. There were a large number of Niners tailgaters in the parking lot that wasn't reserved for season ticket holders. There were Niners tents up, and everyone was rocking a Gore jersey. I would definitely say that the Niners fans outweighed the Jets fans. 

2. In the 300s (the bleeders) I was surrounded by Niners Nation. Including a pair of Niners season ticket holders that were visiting NYC and wanted to see the game while they were here. There were people from Berkeley that showed up too. In the four rows around us, there was a probably 5-1 ration of Niners fans to Jets fans.

3. Starting in the 4th quarter, Jets fans gave up on their own team. They were leaving and leaving quickly. But the Niners fans, Forever Faithful, stayed until the end of the game, many of which going down to better seats that the Jets fans abandoned. The stadium was filled with red instead of green.

4. Once the game was over, everyone was screaming ""Let's Go Niners!"" on their way to the escalators. Me, I screamed ""Who's got it better than us?"" to an awesome reply of ""Nobody!""

I was surrounded by my people. It never happens when I go to a sports bar or anything.

He was talking to an older guy (maybe 60 years old) whom I didn't recognize, and when my face changed from non-chalant to HOLY SHIT and he still didn't really turn his head even though I was about a foot from him, I decided the best course of action was to continue walking and leave him be. Pretty cool to see him in the wild though, and I have no idea what he was doing in Emeryville.

A big part of that, looking back, was Roger Staubach had served in Vietnam and, in 1968, my father was killed while serving there. I only tell you this so that you will truly understand just how objective this truly is. The worst three moments of the football fan part of my life are:
3. That bullshit ""pass interference"" call Fred Swearingen perpetrated against Benny Barnes in the 4th quarter of Super Bowl XIII. Or,
2. Watching Randy White try to figure out how to secure the football with a cast on one hand, and then panic and try to lateral it to the closest player with two good hands, only to have that player be Pittsburgh Steeler Dennis Winston. Leading directly to the 2nd Steeler touchdown in 19 seconds, and putting the game barely out of reach. 

But, WITHOUT QUESTION ...
1. The Catch. 
... was the most devastating moment of my NFL fan-life. 

So, knowing that, I tell you this ... I am truly enjoying watching this 49er team play this game. The execution is nearly flawless. They are playing the game at a higher level than anyone else in the league right now. I have been an Alex Smith fan from day one. I drafted him every year based solely on his physical talent, knowing that there would come a year when he would finally be hooked up with the right coach, and/or offensive coordinator, and Alex Smith would be one of the top 3 quarterbacks in the league. I haven't played fantasy football for several years, but there he is!

Those moments are the reason I love football, and Harbaugh just seems to have such a great love for his team. 

I am really honored that the Giants get to play the 49ers for the NFC Championship. If it comes down to it, there's no other team I'd be okay with losing too. The 49ers, no matter how next weekend goes, deserve a tremendous amount of respect and will be a force to be reckoned with under Harbaugh.

1367009465.0,57,self.49ers,1d6eng,"Reflections on Eric Reid, considering all the posts...",sdalt001,66,9,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/1d6eng/reflections_on_eric_reid_considering_all_the_posts/,"We all know we needed a FS, not a SS.  After decades of watching football, I've noticed that it's much harder to find the ""perfect"" FS, than it is to find the perfect SS.  SS are basically undersized, glorified MLB's.  They are mostly used in run support and, depending the scheme, defending the TE.  We did not need another SS, despite some intriguing prospects such as Cyprien and Elam.  However, taking those guys would still leave us with a void at FS.  With that said, the most fundamental assignment for a FS is to play centerfield.  These players are responsible for containing the top of the defense, and are responsible for the over the top throws to the trees known as WR's.  The player must have the height to really stand a chance at defending the pass, to say a Calvin Johnson (6'5""+).  The player must have elite jumping ability (over 36"").  The player must be able to cover a lot of ground in a very short amount of time (great 40 time **paired with an elite first 10 time**).  The player must be able to change direction with efficiency as well (sub 7.00 3 cone and a 20 yard shuttle close to 4.20).  This enables the player to truly patrol the entire backfield.  Not to mention the intangibles of being a leader, etc. 

When you boil it down, the measurables of a FS become almost irreplaceable.  You are essentially looking for a mirror image of an X or a Z receiver.  I've seen more tape on DE's and S's than any other position leading up to the draft.  After much deliberation, I came the conclusion that Reid was the best candidate on measurables alone, **before we drafted him.**  However, I wasn't sure if we'd take a DE in the first or if Reid would even be there at 31.  

Reid is over 6'1"".  

He has elite jumping ability (40.5 vert and 134 broad), both of which were the best mark of any DB at the combine.

For a S, his 40 time was Greased Lightning at 4.53...there is a reason why DB's don't play WR.  Most importantly was his first 10 time at 1.47.  To put that into perspective, the only players with a faster first 10 was Tavon Austin and Marquise Goodwin.  Austin is a slot WR and Goodwin is a former 100M track star.  The first 10 is actually the most important portion of the 40.  The rationale is how often are players required to run a dead sprint for 40 meters?  A DB's ability to recover is often with a short distance to the WR (on a double move, etc.)  Remember, football is a game of inches.  The difference between a 3 foot window for QB being there and not, is the difference between a 1.55 first 10 and a 1.47 first 10.  Reid has elite first 10 speed.  The majority of the RB's this year were around 1.57.  This may sound like splicing hairs, but if you really think about it, the difference between a 4.3 and 4.4 40 is huge.  Scouts rave about a 4.3.  Now, take that same .1 seconds and create separation in the first 10 yards, instead of a full 40 yards...that is a gigantic difference.

His 3 cone and 20 yard shuttle were not elite (compared to the rest of the field), but were right where you'd want them to be (6.99 and 4.22).

He has Sasquatch length arms for a DB (33.5 inches), less than 2 inches shorter than Aldon's King Kong arms.

He played for 3 years at an SEC powerhouse and was a member of an elite secondary that faced the best of the best in the NCAA.

As posted already, this guy a consummate leader http://image.cdnllnwnl.xosnetwork.com/pics32/640/BV/BVGMHUYQWYFNHJL.20121014050854.JPG.

Now, I agree with a lot of the concerns of the Niner faithful on reddit.  I've seen the tape on Reid and he does demonstrate issues getting burned deep.  However, the majority of those occasions LSU was lined up with him as the single high S.  Fangio rarely left Goldson alone over the top.  Secondly, LSU had a very aggressive defensive scheme that featured a lot of blitzing from the secondary.  Fangio's blitzes are more calculated and safer, in the sense that he makes sure there is help over the top, so the QB can't just throw it as far as he can and have the WR go get it.

Is Reid perfect in all facets of his game?  No.  But, he has all the ideal starting points to coach up an elite FS.  With coaching, Reid can make huge strides.  Remember, Culliver was chosen because Baalke said a 6'0""+ CB that is over 200 lbs, and runs in the 4.4's is very hard to find.  He basically implied that unless a CB has these measurables, they will never truly be better than an elite #2 CB.  When we took Culliver, we had a stable of #2's, much like most teams.  However, if we really wanted to try to get a true #1, Culliver was the guy.  With the same rationale, if we want a true #1 or elite FS, Reid is the guy.  That is why we moved up.  That is why we should be stoked; because after Reid, the cupboard is bare in this year's crop of true FS's.

NFL.com compares him to Mark Barron.

I know NBC reported Davis suffered a conspcussion; I hope he can return, if not for your game against AZ then definitely for your first playoff game. I didn't hear a definite verdict on Manningham's knee. I think you guys are much more fun to watch - and far more deadly - when both those guys are healthy.

I am ashamed that there are Hawks fans calling to use a pic if Chancellor's hit on Davis for the sidebar bet. I think that's disrespectful considering the result of the play was an injury. I'm embarrassed that my fellow fans would even consider something like that.

I wish the 9ers the best of luck in the post season and would love to play you all again in a few weeks, hopefully with full, healthy rosters.",,False,,t5_2rebv,False,,seattle,True,t3_15d0wk,http://www.reddit.com/r/49ers/comments/15d0wk/seahawks_fan_here_i_earnestly_hope_davis/,
