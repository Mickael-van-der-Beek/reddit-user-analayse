1345057622.0,140,self.exmuslim,y9xur,To young women considering leaving Islam...,chordaetendineae,162,22,69,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/y9xur/to_young_women_considering_leaving_islam/,"Do it. As soon as you possibly can. There is nothing in this 'faith' for you. And believe me, people will make it as difficult as possible for you to get out, but you need to understand that you are every bit as valuable as anyone else, and OWE it to yourself to find a way out.

I apologize in advance if this reads a little ""personal-teenage-diary"" or too whiny. I have a lot of emotions coursing through me right now, and I just need them out.

I'm a 24-year-old Canadian woman. My family moved to a suburb just outside Toronto from Pakistan when I was 13. I left home at 17 and have tried my best to never look back. I had some semblance of a relationship with my parents until last year because the constant fear of verbal and physical abuse got too much. They're currently about 90% cut off (I check in on them once every three or four months via phone call).

1. The followers of this faith will have you believe that you need correction at all times. I remember being 14 and beaten to an inch of my life by my father for cutting (a guidance counselor found out at school and told them) because I was dealing with profoundly low self-esteem... from being beaten and berated at home on a regular basis. It was a cycle I did not get out of til last year, years after moving out. Thing is, I never ended up learning how to healthily deal with my anger - role modelling is important to social development in children, and it'll fuck you up proper when there is conflict, and your parents are allowed to scream, hit and berate you... but you aren't allowed to cry, speak out or do anything about your own anger. Eventually you take it out on yourself, til you become entirely incapable of healthily working through your anger and sadness. It's taken me five years of intensive self-therapy to realize this. I've only now started to feel anger in ways I think are healthy-ish.  Islam will tell you that your parents and elders are all-knowing and deserve the utmost respect, but here's how real life works: you don't need to respect anyone who won't respect you.

2. Get help and support if you need it, but try and find someone who will 'get' it. This is asking for the impossible, but the white/Western counselors and psychs I ended up going to were quick to say that I was experiencing 'cultural' violence and I should find a 'faith-based' support. The 'faith-based' support I was sent to was more concerned that I had missed a fast during Ramadan or 'talked back' than the fact that my body was covered in hundreds of cuts, dozens of which had fresh stitches. Somehow, broken bodies are more acceptable when you're a woman. This is fucked up. Someone who has the same beliefs that you were raised in is in no way better equipped to provide you with emotional support - if anything, they are worse. I remember my family complaining that I wouldn't open up, but doing that meant further physical and verbal abuse because my issues were with them in the first place. The muslim 'counselor' my family ended up with after my first suicide attempt (that's how much I learned to hate myself) was quick to tell me that maybe if I just ____ that I would give my parents less grief.

3. You and your body are valuable. This is the 'faith' that told me that my rapist 'should have married me"" when I was ten years old. I never told anyone or sought justice because at ten years old, the thought of having to marry the disgusting man who did those things to me was terrifying - even though logically that wouldn't have happened, and he would likely have been brought to justice. How fucked up is that? The only thing I remember thinking about was that I wasn't ready to be a wife. NO SHIT. I am still living with this damage and trying very hard to heal. I look at my body and I absolutely abhor it sometimes. I'm trying to heal and reminding myself that I'm beautiful and worthy of kindness, but it is a struggle. It is a difficult struggle. This is the same religion that tells me to cover up my ankles/ass/etc in the interest of modesty. Guess what: men shouldn't be raping women. I'll dress based on how I want to dress, not based on the fear of a man 'inexplicably' raping me. No one 'asks' to be raped.

4. This one isn't fun: as long as you live under your parents' roof, please pretend to be a 'good' muslim. I can't stress this enough. I used to sing Deftones lyrics to myself under my breath during prayers to stay sane. Save up as much as you can so that you can leave and live your own life. Trying to get what you want while you're still under their roof is extremely difficult, and prospectively risky. They want your thoughts? Don't be honest. Always tell them what they want to hear, because sometimes their desire to hear the 'truth' results in you getting fucked over by being vulnerable.

5. No one. No one. No one. Is allowed to touch you without your consent. You brother is NOT allowed to hit you. Your mother is NOT allowed to slap you for not washing the dishes. I don't care what anyone else says to you - you cannot put up with this physical abuse, because you'll start to believe that you deserve it when you're older and you WILL let other people treat you just as badly. I did for far too long. No one deserves to feel like that.

6. Get a job, get educated, do what makes you feel good and empowered but also makes it easier for you to take care of yourself. Your parents might give you shit for this, as mine did. Having a daughter who was working 2 part-time jobs at fourteen was a major source of shame for my parents, but I can guarantee you that I wouldn't be where I was had I not worked my ass off. I'm 24, haven't graduated from university yet but I'm in a mid-level position at a major hospital because I can speak to having 8 years of experience in my field. I took no money from my parents for school despite them offering. Not being allowed to learn or gain meaningful working experience outside of your kitchen, as would have been my family's desire, is one way to fuck yourself over. Remember, you want to be as solid and independent as you can be. Many muslim families keep their daughters from doing these things to keep them weak and dependent. You owe it to yourself to do better than that.

7. There's nothing wrong with masturbating. Do it as much as you want. Same with sexual experimentation. Your body is amazing and you deserve to feel good about it. Just don't get caught, mkay?

8. The constant lying that you have to do with your parents to feel sane? It's necessary but it will catch up with you, til you find yourself lying without having any reason to. It becomes habitual, so you need to keep it to a bare minimum. In real life, the truth is valuable but I know that being able to keep up a good lie is essential to survival as a female in a muslim family.

9. One day you'll perhaps have daughters. I want you to think about how you would feel if someone treated your daughters the way your family treats you. If it doesn't equate, something is wrong.

10. There are people who love you for being you. They may not be related to you by blood but that isn't necessary. My chosen family is made up of my little sister, my best friend (also a queer ex-muslim), my two roommates and a small handful of other folks. I don't talk to my parents much but I always have someone who will come with me to the hospital, give me support and honest advice when I ask for it, keep me company when I'm sad, and make me feel like a million bucks when I need it. This is what a family does. My parents tried quite hard to get me to choose between them and friends, i.e. ""fine, no one will take care of you and you'll get raped and die on the streets if you don't do as we say"". My 'chosen' family would never force me to choose between them and someone/something else. That's what unconditional love looks like.

My question is for ex-Muslim women what has been your experience with hijab. You can put any positives or negatives. Did you feel safer with hijab or without hijab? Please answer if you have lived in Arabic countries or if not okay as well. I do not ask Muslim women because they have more bias, of course if they wear hijab they say they love it, they never say ""oh I wear hijab but I really hate it"".

I also read some Arabic atheist blogs and sites and like a lot of what they say.

1367388883.0,128,self.exmuslim,1dgugs,I snapped.,whereistheLID,149,21,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1dgugs/i_snapped/,"My parents never allowed me to wear jeans.

A few months ago, I bought myself a pair of nice, dark blue, boot-cut jeans. They blended in with the rest of my black, gray, and navy bottoms in my closet, and you couldn't tell they were jeans material without getting a close look. I threw them in the wash every 2 weeks or so with the rest of my clothes, and no one was any the wiser. I thought I had gotten away with it.

Today, my mom decided to do the laundry while I was at school, then my younger sister came home from school and took everything out of the dryer and sorted everyone's clothes out. She took one look at the jeans and ran to show my mom, ""Mamma look, Aapi [big sister] has a pair of jeans!"" 

That is when the storm began.

I got home late as my last class ended at 8. I stepped into front door, and my mom, dad, and sister were waiting for me in the living room. My dad spoke first. 

""What pants are you wearing?""

""The ones I usually wear. These gray slacks. Why?""

My mom pulled out my jeans from the chair, ""Is this yours?"" 

Millions of excuses started running through my head: *They're my friend's*; *No, I've never seen them before*; *I had to buy them for a project*; *I borrowed them from a friend for a social experiment*.... Even crazier: *We needed to study fiber polymers for my chemistry class, and I was assigned the jeans category*.

But I was tired, and these words stupidly slipped out: ""Yes, but I only wore it once.""

My dad exploded. He stood up, snatched the jeans from my mom's hand, and shoved them in my face. ""Khabees!"" He shouted,. ""Shaitan! Is this the kind of behavior you are learning at that college you go to?"" I said nothing - this kind of question merited no response. He continued. ""You are my oldest daughter and you are supposed to set an example for your sister. This is what you are teaching her? That she can wear whatever kinds of clothes are in fashion in America and walk around naked behind her parents' back?"" 

Now that needed a response. I calmly said, ""She's old enough to think for herself, and I don't walk around naked. I'm completely covered whenever I go out.""

My dad didn't listen. ""Do you know who wears clothes like these?"" he went on. ""Prostitutes wear jeans. Women who have no shame and no respect for their religion and their society wear clothes like these.""

So I snapped. ""And how would you know that?"" I asked.

That's when he slapped me, real hard, on the side of my head. He yelled more curses at me and slapped me some more. I didn't flinch but I kept my eyes locked on his. He shouted at me to lower my gaze and behave like a woman who comes from a respectable household. I didn't. He hit me again, on my back. My mom grabbed his hands and tried to stop him. He stopped and stood there panting. He threw the jeans at my mom and said, ""Go burn this. I don't want this in my sight."" She didn't leave. My sister had already ran to hide in her room.

Then he quietly said, in his normal voice, ""Beti [daughter], everything you are learning in America goes entirely against the values I raised you with. I did not bring you here to become Americans. You are a Muslim woman and you should behave like a Muslim woman.""

I responded, ""There is nothing in Islam that forbids women from wearing jeans specifically.""

He started raising his voice again. ""Jeans are clothes that are made for men. It is forbidden for women to wear men's clothes. I have already let you wear pants to school because it was required at school, but after this, you are no longer going to wear pants anymore. And you will start wearing your burkha when you go to school.""

""I don't want to wear a burkha. I have to walk really long distances to walk to my classes, and it gets hot. I'm already covered from head to toe without wearing a burkha.""

""This heat is nothing! You will burn in hell for dressing immodestly.""

""Then let me burn in hell, that's in another lifetime.""

""Astaghfirullah! You are a Muslim and you dare to say something like that?""

""Maybe I don't want to be a Muslim then!"" I shouted.

The storm renewed again. ""What did you say? Do you know what kind of gunah [sin] you committed right now?""

I said nothing.

""Read the shahadah now and take back what you said!""

I said nothing. He slapped me. ""Read it! Say it! Say the shahadah!"" 

I still said nothing.

""Shaitan! This is what America has made you into. This is it! You are no longer going to college. You will not go to classes tomorrow. You will sit at home and read the Quran and pray. I am taking you out of this shaitany institution tomorrow, and you will stay at home! Now get out of my sight!""

I didn't argue. I left. My mom sat there sobbing.

I'm in my room right now, shaking and trying not to think of what happened, trying to calm myself by letting everything out, writing everything down while it's still fresh. I translated everything to the best of my ability from Urdu. Maybe I will submit this, maybe I won't.  The writing helps. I feel hyper aware of my surroundings, of my sister's slow breathing as she tries to sleep over the sound of my typing. I don't blame her for anything. My mom was just in here with my jeans. She told me to throw it away and didn't want to see me wearing it ever. I said nothing, took the jeans and hung them in my closet. I couldn't even iron them; I hate un-ironed clothes. She asked if I wanted the ice-pack. I said nothing. She walked out. I can hear her crying.

I've had worse. This was mild compared to prior events. But I have never come so close to voicing my true thoughts before. Too much rage. I should  be more careful next time. I'm not worried. Everything will blow over by next week and I'll return to school. 

Good thing I have no finals this week and I can afford to miss a few classes.

**UPDATE:** He came to wake me up this morning and told me to go to school, to not miss class. ""Do you know why I brought this family here?"" he asked. He answered his own question, ""I want all of you to get a good education so you will be able to stand up on your own two feet if something were to happen to us. Education is very important in life and even our prophet said to seek education at all costs. But always keep this in mind: do not forget about your religion and its teaching. Islam will guide you on the right path. Do not turn your back on it or you will have much to answer to Allah. Forget about trying to fit in and trying to please your classmates with this fashion nonsense because none of this matters to Allah. Go get ready, and don't forget to wear your burkha.""

Sure, dad. Whatever you say, dad. I'll wear my burkha. I'll just change in the car.

---

Thank you everyone for your support and encouragement. I love the community this subreddit fosters. For your ease, I am totally fine, no damage done. I get yelled at often, but this kind of major explosion happens only once in a while so I know how to handle myself.

For those of you suggesting I call the police, I know you mean well and I appreciate the concern, but it would not be the ideal action to take at any time.  I can't obviously call the police because I don't want things getting out of control.  It will only tear our family apart, and it will cause more harm than good in the long run. He has never lifted a hand against my younger sisters and tends to be more lenient with them; I don't know if this is because he is getting old and feeble or because they're still babies in his eyes. Either way, I'm glad. I simply wanted to vent a little, and posting to this subreddit helped  a lot. I received some good advice, the best of which seem to be to take control into your own hands. Getting slapped here and there isn't worth the trouble, I'm made of stronger stuff than that!

I would move out in a heartbeat if I could, but I attend classes full time and am still financially independent on my parents, although I'm proud to say that my college education is fully paid for through scholarships. Also, my sisters and my mom need me. I stick around knowing that I can help my sisters grow up to be better people than my dad ever would. One of my sisters has already started spouting my dad's fundamental beliefs, and I see it as my responsibility to teach her to think logically and question everything. I can't do that if I'm not there. Maybe once they graduate high school, I'll have more freedom...

Last night was 4th of July. I rarely EVER go out with friends, but I live in a big city and there's a big firework celebration downtown and a few of my friends and I decided to go. The fireworks were around 10 pm. After the fireworks we went to Applebee's to eat.

Getting out of downtown was a nightmare. There were THOUSANDS of people and traffic was ridiculously backed up. It would take literally 20 minutes to drive 1 block. So I got home around 12:45 am. 

When I was about 2 minutes away from my house my mother called me. I saw the call and rejected it because I was already almost home. As soon as I got in the door, my mother was there, ready to fight.

She started yelling immediately asking me where I've been, why I ignored her calls, who I was with, etc. I just said ""I was downtown with my friends watching the fireworks and I went to Applebee's"". (I even had a box of leftover food to prove I was actually eating there).

My mother wasn't having it. She starts accusing me of being a slut and saying she KNOWS I was out doing ""bad things"" with boys. She's screaming at me and just shouting insults and I go upstairs and she follows me. 

She says I need to get the hell out of her house because she doesn't want a slut of a daughter. Apparently she called my dad earlier and he told her to lock me out of the house. So I grab some of my things (I had work in the morning) and start heading down the stairs. She's still yelling so I stop and say ""It's really none of your business what I was doing. I'm an adult, and I did nothing wrong. I'm not even that unreasonably late"" 

She says ""if you're in my house everything is my business""

and I just say ""Well I'm not going to be in your house anymore so you can go to hell""

and she punches me in my arm really hard. I just stand there and kinda look at her and she punches me twice more. On the third punch I grab her arm and say ""Do not hit me"" and let go of it and continue down the stairs.

 She acts like her arm is really hurt (it wasn't. I seriously barely touched it lol) and my sister comes running down the stairs and hits me on the back of the head really hard. I felt really dizzy all of the sudden and kinda sat down on the stairs and she hits me AGAIN on the head. My arm kinda jerks on the carpet and I have a huge mark of carpet burn on my arm. Ugh anyway

I just get up, get my things, and start heading out while my mother yells at my sister for interfering (honestly I think she was starting to feel some remorse). But then as I'm heading out the door she starts insulting me more, accusing me of sleeping around (I don;t) and saying things like ""oh you just go to the gym so you can stand around in your bra in front of boys"" (I've never done that, actually).

So I drive around for a while before calling a friend. She's a 40 year old American convert. She tells me to come to her apartment. I was really hesitant because I know this woman struggles a lot and I didn't want to be a burden on her. She's being evicted from her home and lost her job and is about to be homeless. But she was insistent on taking me in anyway. 

So I drive over to her apartment and I park outside. At this point I'm pretty shaken up and I'm crying a lot. I didn't want to go inside because she has a young daughter who was probably sleeping and I didn't want to disturb her. Then I hear a knock on my window. The woman's husband, an older Syrian man, is standing there, and tells me to open the door. 

He says to me ""No, no you don't cry. Look at me. You do not cry. I will take care of you"" 


And I just fucking lost it. My own dad told my mom to lock me out of the house and not let me back in, and my mother and sister took it upon themselves to smack me around and throw me out, and this man who I had met ONCE in my life was treating me like I was his daughter or something.

They had me sleep in their daughter's bedroom. I woke up this morning, dragged myself to work looking like an absolute mess, and then went out to sign a lease on my new apartment. I'm moving in tomorrow. 

My mother texted me today asking ""are you ok?"". No bitch, I'm not fucking OK. I'm pissed as hell because I literally did NOTHING wrong (seriously, I've done some crazy shit before but this time I was 100% innocent), got my head beaten and got kicked out. I contacted the local police department and they will go with me to collect my things from the house, to ensure that she doesn't try to start anymore fights or prevent me from getting my things.

I saw this page at a friends house when they were talking about how you are all sluts and kufurs and should all be killed. I needed to make this post I typed this on a txt document and am going to make a account and upload it whenever I'm at my kids school. I'll use the library. I'm going to try to be as detailed as possible without exposing myself. Sadly I can't upload it from home or respond to you because the computer is monitored by my husband. 

To all the young girls here don't no matter what you do ever agree to visit back home. This is how my mess started I was a happy 15 year old going to school, I was a cheerleader, I had lots of friends, I had a great life. Then my dad suggested we all ,me my mom and male siblings, go to the ME to visit my grandparents for the summer. I was excited I didn't see them in a long time. We were suppose to stay two months, one week before we were supposed to go back my dad tells me your staying. I was shocked I tried to argue but he pushed and said no I don't like how you act in America you are going to live with your grandparents from now on. I was completely blind sided we never had a conversation about it but in hindsight he was a pretty absentee dad. When I protested again he took both my passports out of his pocket and lit them on fire. 

They left the next week. I refused to speak to them for a year. My grandparents were much stricter they kept on a tight curfew a bus picks me up to go to the all girls school in the morning and drops me off in the afternoon. If I want to go out with it has to be with my female cousins only and only to there house. They threw out all my clothes calling then to proactive and bought me all jilbabs and forced to wear the hijab. My grandad changed too he went from being a nice old man. To assuming the role of a over protective father if I would question him or my grandma I will get hit with a cane. The worst time was when they caught me watching a rap video on tv. He thought it was a porno before I could explain he hit me on the top of my head so hard it hurt when I put on the hijab for a week. 

I barley passed school because I didn't have a grasp on the language. Once I graduated they told me it was time to get married and that my cousin had asked to marry me. I was mortified he was in his 30s and I was 18 at the time and he was my cousin. I begged them not to do it, but they said it was for my own good he's a good pious hardworking man I'll thank them later. Between our engagement to our wedding I maybe talked to him for an hour. I was extremely uncomfortable I remember him asking me if I was a virgin over and over and saying if I was lying he would make me regret it. 

We got married and once again my life changed for the worse, despite me trying to make the best out if the situation. He was mean, abusive, and obsessive. He would inspect the house everyday to make sure it was spotless he stuck my face down on the tiles to show me I missed a spot. He threw food at me when it wasn't cooked to his liking. And would force himself on me every night, no exceptions. 

Then I got pregnant had a daughter, got pregnant a month later had another daughter, a year later had another daughter. He took me to a ""specialist"" to see why we were only having girls. He gave me some herbs told me to avoid all sour foods and pray for god to forgive your sins and he would give us a boy. 10 months later he got his boy. Now I'm here taking care of four toddlers on my own. He leaves for work comes back and expects everything to be done. And for me to be in a sociable mood. 

I hate my life. I hate my husband. I hate my parents. I hate god. If it wasn't for my kids I would have killed myself along time ago. Part of me wishes I did do it earlier. So please girls beware please don't fall in this trap. Please be smarter than me.",(Advice/Help),False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,advice,,True,t3_1kcql7,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1kcql7/beware/,

1360338630.0,99,self.exmuslim,184w6l,How Learning About Islam Drove Me Away From It,Salisillyic_Acid,111,12,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/184w6l/how_learning_about_islam_drove_me_away_from_it/,"I was born in India. I spent my early childhood in Saudi Arabia. My parents are well educated and they raised me with a strong emphasis on Islam. I learned to read the Quran like most young Muslims do. I went to tajweed classes, I attended halaqas, I went on umrah and hajj. When I was still quite young, my family moved to Canada.


After moving to the West, my parents began to place an even heavier emphasis on Islam. We were always what most would consider a moderate family. We thought suicide bombings were haraam, we did not agree with Al Qaeda or the Taliban, but nonetheless we were not too fond of America either.


My parents bought me Islamic literature, they took me to talks given by local imams and shiekhs. They bought me books by Harun Yahya, I spent hours and hours watching videos on the internet by preachers and evangelizers such as Zakir Naik. I was enthralled. I read about the scientific miracles of the Quran. Embryology being in the Quran before scientists discovered it. The miracle of the two bodies of water not mixing, mountains being pegs, the seven layers of the atmosphere, and the big bang. All of these amazing bits of ""science"" were in my holy book!


When I was about 12, a supply science teacher put on a video in science class. The movie mentioned human history and made a cursory mention of how humans had evolved from other life forms. Right there, in the middle of class, I pulled out a book by Harun Yahya that I had been reading. I called out the teacher. I told him evolution was a lie and that he was making a mistake teaching it to us. I was a shy kid, but I was not going to sit back and let this man lie to my classmates. The poor teacher, I saw his face sink, he was going to say something, but he bit his tongue and turned the movie off. I had won. This was all the proof I needed to reaffirm what Harun Yahya had told me in his books - the scientists all knew evolution was 'just a theory' and all lies. The evil scientists just did not admit the lies they knew they were telling. I felt vindicated.


When I was 13, I enrolled in a Hifz program to make my family proud. My mother had told me how a Hafiz would be asked on judgement day to say the names of ten people he wanted in heaven with him. At first I thought, wait a second, I thought there was no intercession on judgement day. But what my ami-jaan was saying was amazing enough to push the doubt to the back of my head.


At 14, I met a boy in high school. He was a hardcore Salafi. He told me he supported the Taliban. He told me Bin Laden was framed for 9/11 and the West just hated Islam and wanted to kill Muslims. America and the Yahood wanted to start a new crusade against Islam. They would not rest until they conquered all Muslim lands. He told me that the Islam I followed was a ""pussified, westernized"" version of Islam. Muslims like me were like house negroes. He told me that unless we followed the Sunnah and Quran in its complete entirety, that our faith was lacking. After all, the prophet was the best of men, and that we had to follow him exactly. Up till now, all that meant to me was maybe growing a beard when I was older, entering the washroom with my right foot, doing dawah, and other such benign things. To me Jihad was an inner struggle. My friend told me it was an inner struggle against Shaitan and an outer struggle against Shaitan's agents - the westerners and the liberal Muslims.


I was confused. My friend told me that his Islam was pure. It came directly from the source. Other sects were based on bida'a. Of course, I knew what bida'a was, but my idea of bida'a was birthdays and celebrating Halloween. I knew bida'a was used to refer to label the practices of wayward Muslims, but I'd never heard anyone (let alone a young teenager) say the entire world was in jahilliya. 


I was torn. As a Muslim, his case for Islam was strong. After all, who was I to question God's own messenger or his message. I decided to do some research. If this was the true Islam, then I would have to become a true Muslim. Not a grocery store Muslim, picking and choosing what to follow.


I read, I read and I read. I read for months. I spent time on forums. I read books. I read everything I could get my hands on.


It sickened me.


This so-called real Islam was disgusting. The stories of Mohammad made my stomach churn. I had a Sahih Bukhari book in my house. It came with commentary. I read it. There were stories about taking sex slaves, the history of the Mohammad's behaviours. I read more about the Ummah, the taba and the taba tabi'en. I tried to find different interpretations, but they didnt satisfy me.


It made me want to throw up. No. This could not be the real Islam. Islam was peace. Islam was submission to God. Islam was getting up early on Eid and watching my mother make kheer. Islam was long nights of taraweeh. Islam was samosas in Ramadan. Islam was science. Islam was a miracle.


I was 16. I couldnt handle it. I stopped reading. I stopped learning. I just focused on school for a bit.


I stumbled on a forum of liberal Muslims. They called themselves the Submitters, or Quranists. The Quranost rejected the hadith. Not just some hadith, but the entire corpus of Sunni Hadith and scholarship could be tossed. Every book and every collection. Bukhari, Tirmidhi, Muslim, Abu Dawood, Al-Nasai, Ibn Majah - all out the window. They the believed only in the Quran. I read about how the hadith were corrupt. Allah did not gaurentee their authenticity. I read some more. The hadith were lies, the Quran was the only truth. Without the hadith, I could reject all the stories about Mohammad's misadventures. I could reject the infighting after his death. I could turn a blind eye to the obvious political maneuvering and posturing the entire ummah took part in from the day Mohammad became a prophet, to the Rashidun Khalifas. After all, we learned what happened there mainly from the Sirah and the Hadith, and the Quranists said it was all bogus. I did not need to hear their proofs. I just wanted a cop out. I needed a way to reconcile the Islam I grew up with and the Islam I had learned about in the past year.


I was happy! I was excited. I started reading about Islam again, I thanked God for opening my eyes to the truth. What a relief. Cognitive dissonance was driving me insane, and how better to stop it than becoming a Quran-only Muslim.


It did not last long. I was at the masjid, I stayed after Isha to listen to the Imam give a talk on friday nights as he usually did. Today was about wife beating. He read out from the Quran. He explained that wife beating was not allowed in Islam. The Quran simply told us to lightly tap our wives with something like a miswak when she misbehaved, but only after following some other steps.


I knew bullshit when I heard it. I went home and and asked on the forum. Their answer was the same. I did not buy it. I read some older English translations. Beating was allowed. I remembered what my friend had told me before. My Islam was a ""pussified, westernized"" Islam. It was changed to fit the time I was in. Wife beating was not allowed in Western society. It was a disgusting crime, so of course it had to be explained away from the Quran. The Quranist's explanation made no sense. They were arguing against history.


Growing up, I was taught every other religion was wrong. If Islam was wrong too, then what else was there? I did not know what to do, so I did nothing.


A few months later, I stumbled across a video on YouTube. It was by a biologist named Kenneth Miller. Miller gave an hour long lecture in support of evolution. I watched. The video was not even over before I knew this was it. It was over. I could not consider myself a Muslim in any sense of the word any more.


Everything I knew. My entire faith. My community. It was built on a lie told centuries ago.


Its been five years now. I'm happy. I'm about to graduate from university. I've come to accept the way the world is. I majored in evolutionary biology. (Syed Qutb must be turning in his grave.)My parents do not know anything, but they have their suspicions. I'm applying for medical school, and as a back up I'll be applying to some biotech programs. Whatever happens. I'll be happy. I'll try to live my life without harming anyone.


I do not preach to Muslims. In the past five years, four of my friends have told me they no longer believe in the faith anymore. They came to me hoping I could soothe their doubts and convince them to come back to Islam.

You, the one that convinces themselves they aren't really coming here in search of some relief.  You know who you are.  The one who prays fajr early morning but by night is plagued by those incessant thoughts of doubt.  The one that hates themselves for that doubt.  Who allows their family and friends to convince them its something wrong with them.  The one who feels they have failed because their iman is weak.  I am talking to you.  

You are not weak.  And you are not wrong.  There is nothing wrong with you.  You have tried, I know, to remain faithful.  You have probably tried harder than those who make you feel the worst.  You look at them and wonder how it is so *easy* for them to believe and hate yourself for not being able to do the same.  Don't hate yourself.

And you are not alone.  Do not be driven away by the vitriol that occasionally arises on this subreddit.  From those who will talk about their experience with a Muslim and call that person a bitch or a bastard, and say they hate them, call them a “Mussie”, or call them stupid.  These people are not all of us.  They are bitter, and understandably so.  See they, like you, most likely, have gone through this exact same process.  Their families and friends have turned against them in face of their doubts.  They have been hurt.  They watch their mothers cry and feel iti is their fault.  Their mothers tell them it is.  They have become bitter.  And that is understandable.
But I do not hate you.  I do not think you are stupid.  I do not think you are a bitch or a bastard.  I would not refuse to shake your hand if I knew your beliefs and I would not turn away from you if you needed help.  What I believe is that you are a victim.  Like I was.  Like we all were.  You probably don’t agree.  You see it a different way.  Maybe you always will.  And that’s ok.  But maybe in time you will come to see things the way I do.  

I make no effort to conceal my true efforts.  I dislike Islam.  I would love to see it, and all other religions which demand its followers suspend their ability to question and think and ponder things for themselves and arrive at what they believe to be the truth, eliminated from this world we share.  But not forcefully.  Not with hatred or by an us vs. them mentality.  I would love to see it eradicated by promoting the beauty of questioning, and rationality, and long insomniatic nights spent questioning the nature of life, and by not squelching those doubts in a futile attempt to restore faith in something you know deep down is not true.  Yes, that’s what I would love to see in this world.  I would love to recruit every one of you to join my side because I believe it would make this world a better place.  But it is not out of this desire that I extend my hand to you.  It is out of my love for my fellow human being.  Because I know one of you, somewhere, is experiencing the same pain I felt for so many years.  And I want you to know you are not alone.  In your darkest hour, be comforted by knowing there are people out there who understand and who would come to your aid, even if you were a perfect stranger to them.  I am one such person.  I am here for you.  Any day or any time.  If you need to talk to someone who understands.  Send me a message.  Or don’t.  Hate me if you want.  Hate me for everything its worth in recognizing what I am: an apostate from your religion, adamant, and confident in their opposition to it.  But know that I am still here for you, without judgment and without reservation.  Human to human.  Free mind to free mind.  I’ve been where you are.  And I have no idea where I’m going.  But if I can help someone along the way, then I’ll have felt every ounce of pain I’ve taken in along the way was worth it.

",,97,12,70,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/17h90b/went_to_an_islamic_wedding_and_im_pretty_sickened/,"My mother and sisters and I drove a few hours out of town this weekend for a Muslim wedding. We are friends of the groom's family. The wedding (contract signing ceremony) was held at the bride's house. The house is divided by a wall between the living room and the dining room. The women sat in the living room, and the men in the dining room. 

The bride comes out looking gorgeous and really excited. She was so sweet and seemed to be really happy that she was getting married. Well, it was time to do the ceremony/contract. 

The Sheikh/men decided to put up room dividers between the living room and the dining room, as to place a physical barrier between the men and women and forbade the women from crossing. Then they proceeded to start the ceremony in the dining room without the women, INCLUDING THE BRIDE. 

So the bride's sister crossed over and argued with the men but the sheikh kept yelling at her to get back into the women's section. Note, this is at her house, so I have no idea why she didn't tell him to just get bent. 

So all the women didn't get to see the contract ceremony, not even the bride. She sat next to the barrier listening to people marry her off without her presence. I know she wanted to say something, but she looked like she was on the verge of tears. I would have said something, but I don't know the bride's family, and I was in their house and since they didn't say anything I didn't want to cause trouble. 

So I gave up a weekend to go to a wedding that I didn't even get to see because I'm a girl. And the bride didn't get to be part of her own wedding because she's a girl. 

My mother tried to justify it by saying ""well her brother is her wali, so he represents her""

As if grown women (she's 29 and employed) can't represent themselves. They have to be sold off to their husbands without their presence. 

Anyway, as an exmuslim I try, really really try, not to hate the Muslims I know. But this shit just drives me insane and makes it very hard.

1. In a universe infinitely big, where we humans don't make up 0,000000000001% of the size of this vast cosmos, we are supposed to be the folks created in the Heavens. We are so important that we piss God off so much that he'll burn us for eternity if we don't pray five times a day. What makes this worse? God saying that it's for our own good to pray, not because that it gives him anything. Why would I go to hell if I didn't pray, and what's so bad with having sex before marriage? Societies have been doing so and it hasn't been all bad.

2. The ""test"" of God. God is all-knowing. He knows about me, my DNA structure, how I would think, how I would act in any situation at any given time. He knows that I strongly rely on the factual side of reality, since that it's the only thing that has worked really well for us humans, and He knows that if I find absurdities and contradictions in the Qur'an, I'll stop believing. He knows I'm for gay rights, equality of genders and freedom of religion. He knows it makes me sad to know that I can't eat food from my best friend, who is an Atheist. Such practices are viewed as injust and immoral for me and I can't advocate any ideology that would justify them. God made me that way. Why would he want to test me then? Test run or something? He knows me and he needs not to test me, it doesn't do him any good or bad. It's basically me ""choosing"" between heaven or hell, but if God knows which I'll choose, how much is it of free choice? I can't understand his infinite knowledge because my brain is all I have.

3. God's way of dealing with humanity: he has been sending prophets since the beginning of time up until Muhammad, but it hasn't worked. People still fight over religion. People are still way off God's teachings, and God knows all about this. He knew it'd be like this. Why? Does he really want us to this way? It's much easier to assume that, yes, he does want it to be this way, than the other way around. It's a ridiculous, unfair test where many are favourised ahead of others. If you're born as anything non-Muslim, sucks for you.

4. The hate against other religions in Islam: Surat al-Fatihah, a perfect example for that. We read al-Fatihah 17 times a day, and we pray not to be like the ""maghdhoobi 'aleyhim wala al-dhalleen"", the Jews and the Christians. The Jizya tax, which could pretty much be viewed as a form of discrimination, the countless verses that promote hate against Ahl al-Kitab, mentioning how misguided and misfortunate they are, the ""we against the world"" mentality all Muslims have, which is why you see a lot of Muslims ""hate"" the West and the Europeans are all examples of how Islam opposes other spiritual ideologies. Everyone is against Muslims, everyone hates Muslims. Muslims can't live and let live, they believe that, one day, al-Mahdi will come and make the whole world Muslim. Lol.

5. The justification of killing, stoning or chopping off the hands of someone for many reasons, despite the knowledge that God will take care of these people in the Afterlife. Let's take the example of Sweden - a country with laws that many criticise for being ""too soft"" and ""too kind"". Crime rates here are really low, compared to those of the US, where the punishment system is much harsher. We've had criminology in school and we saw statistics that left no doubt that harsh punishments are almost always counterproductive.

6. The absurdities in the Qur'an and Hadith - God turned Jews into pigs, shooting stars are aimed at Jinn who try to listen to Angelic discussions, the Sun setting in a muddy spring, the Sun runs its course and then sets under Allah's throne, Eve was made of Adam's womb, Humans were created in ""ahsan taquim"", the most perfect form, the Devil farts not to hear the Athan, the Devil pisses in my ear if I don't wake up for al-Fajr prayer, Noah's Ark, the palace of Suleyman, the Mi'raj, kissing the Black Stone, drinking water with a very high Arsenic halt and viewing it as holy... you get the point.

7. Inequality between men and women; men are superior to women, men get to inherit double that a woman does, men can strike women, women are forced to cover up as if sexual attraction is one way, not both ways (men are attracted by women, but never the other way around), womens inability to pray and fast due to period, as if God, who has created you in his image, would seriously care about a little bleeding down there, etc.

8. The illogical practice of circumision - why would we chop off what God gave us? We were made in ""ahsan taquim"". Same goes for covering up while you e.g pray. God made you and I'd assume he should accept his creation just the way they are.

9. The fact that the Qur'an borrowed so much from ancient Greek science and indulged it as proof of God, without even realising that the science mentioned in the Qur'an is far from flawless. Read up about this.

10. Islam speaking so highly of itself, when it has proved to be completely unpractical within a couple of centuries of its appearance. It claims to be the perfect word of God, that it is a miracle, that it is the best remedy for humanity, when reality speaks differently on that matter. Millions have been oppressed and got their lives ruined because of Islam. How perfect is something when it could be ""misinterepted"" so easily?

11. Arguments and questions that I could not find any way around when I was a Muslim:
- We say the universe can't create itself, so God is its creator. Who created God? Well, God defies the laws of physics so we can't measure him as such. Why not take a shortcut and say that the universe has always existed and defies the laws of physics and logic?
- Muslims believe that most people are going to Hell. Let's assume that 6/10 are hellbound. We know babies whom are murdered go instantly to heaven (which is not justice). With that in mind, we can easily say that the most human thing is to murder as many babies as I can, because then, I'll save 60% of those from going to Hell. On one hand, I'm being a ruthless murderer, and on the other, I'm an eternal hero. Which am I, according to Islam?
- Why does God lead whom he will to astray? Wasn't that Shaytan's work? Why has he sealed the hearing and sight of many people so that they can't accept Islam? Surely has he led me to astray, as I'm sitting here and writing this. Why? I don't have free choice because He knows exactly how I work and what I'm going to believe in. Either did he make me so that I'll go directly to Hell, or does he not know what I'm going to choose.

12. Islam is a production of its time and age. It's everything you'd expect from the Arabs of the 5th century - Jinn, pilgrimage around the K'abah, sacrificing rituals, ban of *all* alcohol consumption (if you drink a little red wine, you'll get resveratol which is good for your heart), no pig eating (pigs cause troubles if not well-cooked. Otherwise, they're not dangerous), thinking with your heart, flat earth, etc. Yet there is nothing about DNA, electricity, the universe (anything correct), etc. If it was something for all times and ages, no single human being would understand what's meant by the Qur'an. Qur'an was meant for the Arabs of the 5th century, and it is therefore quickly outdated. There isn't anything that specifies Muslims living near the poles, for Muslims praying from the moon or any other planet that we humans might reach within the next centuries. Muhammad was an extremely smart and spiritualy aware man, but he was far from perfect. Humanity do better without his teachings at the moment, and that's how I see things. No one has to agree but I'd rather live in a secular country than a Shariah state.

13. Muslims themselves. Islam may sound all good in practice (which it doesn't, but scholars think it does) but it just isn't working in reality. God knew many of us wouldn't be able to do what Islam requires us to, yet He orders us to. I don't understand that point, no matter how hard I try to justify it. God just sounds like a mean tyrant who creates some so that they go to hell. Look at the Muslim countries, they're miles behind everyone else in everything, and they can't even live up to their own religion.

14. EDT: The concept of eternal torment. Let's assume that life on earth is 120 years at its longest. If I'm very lucky, then I'll live for 120 years, but eventually die. Of course, this is a very long time by earthly measures, and a lot of good/bad deeds can be collected under this time. Let's assume that I spend these 120 years spreading misery and agony on earth, that I even die trying to molest a child. I'll go down in history as the cruelest man ever lived and everyone would wish me hellfire. Now, remember that hell isn't a time-subjected punishment and it can carry on and on to no end. Picture that. What's 120 years compared to an eternity? Absolutely nothing. How could someone be punished for eternity for doing something that is finite? No crime in existence would justify burning in the most harsh and graphic way to no end.

15. And finally, the concept of evolution. It was very easy to assume that God created us all in the heavens and view that story as an actual, literal documentation of what happened. Now when science has evidence that explicitly shows that human life isn't as centrist, important and perfect as God ought it would be, people cry ""that is a metaphor!"". There is absolutely no evidence of Adam and Eve, yet so many will believe that everything in this world evolved, except for us humans, forgetting  how our DNA is 99% similar to the apes'. The same logic applies to many absurdities that are taken as literal fact until proven absurd, which is when scholars declare these doctrines to be metaphorical work of beauty (!!) to save face.",(Opinion/Editorial),False,self,t5_2s7k2,1375936867.0,editorial,,True,t3_1jvnyo,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1jvnyo/why_i_as_a_muslim_sold_myself_and_left_islam/,

TL;DR Feelsgoodman.jpg.
I never knew I could be that happy.

It's an essay, I know. And it's super long. But really: I’m writing this post just in case there are other ex-diligent-Muslimah’s out there to let them know that:

If you’re finding it difficult, believe me, I did too and I understand how stressful it can be. But if you’re going to take it off you have to first be realistic and see how able you are to do it. Don’t try and force it. If you’re big on planning, plan your next moves and take it really slowly, or as slow as you need. It helps to have a group of people you can trust outside of the Muslim community. Just remember that it isn’t shameful what you’re doing. It’s your life and your life is going to end. It’s not going to be the people around you who will enjoy it or waste it. It’ll be you. You have no idea how much better it will feel to just take it off and remove the shackles you have to this religion.


A few of you who are familiar with me know I first began wearing the headscarf when I was around about five years old because, well, I was five years old and embedded with this desire to succeed at everything from a very young age. This included being the best Muslimah, along with being the smartest or the fastest and so on. This did not change much as I got older. My mother started wearing it when she was in her thirties and I essentially mimicked her because at the time I was still a kid who thought the sun shone out of her arse.  My sister started wearing it then as well and took it off pretty soon after. As I initially wore it when I was five, it became a part of my identity and I never once desired its removal. That is until I registered I no longer believed in the Muslim God.



Initially in late January 2012, I toyed with the idea of taking it off. This was around about the time I properly accepted my apostasy. I don’t think I took it that seriously because I never made any strides to making it happen. Time ticked on and I felt my desire to take it off grow because of what I represented, which is a walking advertisement for Islam. Not only that, but people would ask me about “my religion” a lot. I hadn’t noticed it before but what I appeared to be to strangers was a large factor to how they treated me. I just didn’t know any different (I later asked my closer friends about what it was like initially meeting me and they all mentioned feeling “weary” due to the headscarf – considering I live in a Western country where there weren’t a lot of head-scarf Muslims around, they were unsure as to how “normal” I was).



I didn’t think I was able to do it. At first, I would feel panic attacks every time I went outside without my scarf on. The second I stepped outside of the house, it felt as though the world was suddenly a lot smaller and that I was completely exposed. I didn’t know then that this was a very small part of why I couldn’t take it off. Truth is, my hair was something which became special to me as I got older. It was something that was entirely mine to show and something only I could choose or control – it was extraordinarily important to me simply because it was mine.



My first real attempt to take it off was right after Ramadan. The catalyser to this was that I realized that the longer that I “represented Islam” meant the longer I had to appear to follow its rules and represent it as well as I always had. It felt wrong to represent this religion in any other way. Ramadan was filled with non Muslims asking me about Ramadan or Muslims asking me how my fasting was going and I couldn’t stand feeling as though I was a liar. This was when I started taking leaps to make it come off. I brought the subject up with my parents. My father as always wasn’t encouraging but accepting. My mother in contrast told me she’d rather die than face that kind of gossip. For the record, we are associated with a really tight knit Shia Muslim community and have a very high reputation within the community. Obviously my sister taking it off didn’t weigh in with the same consequences because she hadn’t worn it all her life like I did. I’ve come to be known as the more mature sibling. To take it off would mean my mother in particular would have to deal with (in her own words) raising two retarded daughters in the community.



I still attempted to go forward with “the plan” to take it off. I gave myself two weeks to take it off and I didn’t really succeed. I hadn’t factored in the panic attacks or much of anything in particular, I just knew I wanted it off, but I realized I required a lot of planning to make any kind of decision. So I decided to take it in small steps.



The first step was picking a close guy friend I could trust and test out the waters (I knew him since high school and he was quite familiar with my “spiritual journey”, also we have a really good brother-sister sort of friendship so he pretty much fit the bill). The next step was giving myself a more realistic deadline (February 2013) and the last was to trial run it in public somewhere where no one could recognise me.



I went to visit my sister (who is remarkably both accepting and encouraging of my apostasy despite being a 'Muslim') on the other side of the country. My first experience with it off was going from the rural area into the city (aside from a run the evening prior, and I didn’t encounter anyone as it is a rather isolated part of the country so I’m not entirely sure if it counted), and I decided to do it all entirely alone. I woke up pretty early that morning feeling nervous and walked the hour to the train station, went on that two hour train ride and finally reached the city. The first thing I noticed was at first I didn’t feel much different. Somewhere between the space of deciding to take it off, realistically deciding to take it off and actually taking it off, I stopped feeling the panic attacks. I guess it was because I’d already completed the first two steps and the planning must’ve really kicked in, or maybe I just stopped caring so much, or maybe it was because I knew no one else would see me and I could finally be myself. I walked around for around about four hours, taking photos as I went and behaving like a general tourist. There’s no real way to describe how it feels to take it off. I guess I felt really normal for once- and I hadn’t realized I felt different to everyone else before. It’s kind of like waking up one morning and discovering you were different when you didn’t need to be- as if you previously were some sort of pariah in society, intentionally wanting to be an outcast.



Taking it off was freeing. Completely liberating. Just feeling the sun or wind whipping through my head and neck felt amazing. I noticed strangers treated me a little differently than I remembered, too. There were less strangers who made eye contact with me and smiled (probably as to not seem intolerant towards people of other religions), and more strangers who gave way to me in stores (probably because I walked with a little more confidence). It was a pretty awesome day and I felt immediately addicted to it. I just hadn’t realized how much wearing a scarf separated me from general society. I couldn’t wait to take it off again.








The whole experience taught me that the headscarf  doesn’t promote respect for a woman’s modesty or protection from male gaze but rather segregates women to a isolated position in society, one that also bears the responsibility of representing a religion, which both increases her importance in Islam while simultaneously decreases her self worth as a woman. The reduction in self worth is due to the removal of an integral part of being a woman- the freedom to wear what she wants or represent herself as she sees fit. I’m not saying all women don’t want to dress in dresses which hide their shape or in material which rolls down her face, what I’m saying is they aren’t given a choice not to and they have reduced ability to express themselves in colour or wear jewellery. Essentially, women like to feel beautiful on the outside and Islam I feel removes that freedom to be beautiful which underpins her inner confidence, perpetually placing her in a submissive role. Women, I believe, follow Islam more closely than men in from a younger age in most cases due to wearing the headscarf earlier and so are reminded of this position in society on a daily basis. Meanwhile men can get away with doing anything they want because the consequences for them are minimal and purely spiritual, whereas for women in Islam the consequences of inappropriate behaviour can compromise not just her reputation but the reputation of an entire religion. It seems hardly fair to me, and entirely unnecessary. I also believe restricting what a man can see in a woman only increases the level of unwanted gaze as it emphasises a woman’s figure and sexuality more therefore brings more attention to it.



Hope I brought some light into this issue.
If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask.




--I’ve since put it back on mostly for show in this tight knit community. I currently am facing a mother who cries all the time and keeps thrusting a turba in my hand round prayer times. And I indulge her because I can’t stand seeing her cry.  It feels weird praying since I stopped a while ago, but I just don’t know what else to do. She won’t talk to me and pretends she’s not crying when I’m around. It’s impossible to communicate with her. But enough of my problems.





I recently spent a day with a bunch of Arab women who wear headscarves at a beach. One of them remarked to me that what she missed the most about not wearing a headscarf was being able to go into the ocean. And it took all of me not to tell her that life didn’t have to be that way. That Islam was not the one true path. The poor girl isn’t that intelligent and I doubt she’ll ever come to this conclusion. She’s also recently married to a highly religious man so there’s nothing I can do. What we can take from this is a confirmation of my conclusion above.

1349771676.0,75,self.exmuslim,116ro1,Helping a Muslim girl escape family/forced marriage UPDATE,UsingTheInternet,101,26,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/116ro1/helping_a_muslim_girl_escape_familyforced/,"(Preface: I am the [Muslim guy from this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/xt6w9/?sort=old).  This post is vague in order to protect the people involved in this situation.  The [original thread that this thread is providing an update to](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old) can be found [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old).)

Day 1: To summarize the [original thread that this thread is providing an update to](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old), the parents of a 19-year-old Muslim girl whose family and mine are friends attempted to send her off to their home country to be forced into a marriage.  She managed to get away from them at the airport and contacted me to come get her and help her.

Day 2: I had her stay at my house for a few days while my own family was out of town.  The very next day after I created the [original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10tvkf?sort=old), I took her to the courthouse and she managed to get a temporary restraining order against her parents within a few hours.

I then got her added on as the second authorized user on the account for one of my credit cards.  With this arrangement, I am the only person responsible for paying the credit card fees each month; additionally her credit score only benefits when I make my payments on time and does not get affected when I miss a payment or have any other sort of problem with my credit card.  I currently have perfect credit and plan to keep it that way, so this will help her build up an excellent credit score for later on down the line when she's purchasing or applying for various items and services.  Additionally, once her card arrives, she'll be able to charge anything she might need to my account and not worry about it until she's able to get solid financial footing of her own.  My family has no idea that I have this credit card (I have everything related to it sent to my PO Box), so I'm not worried about anyone finding out about this.

The next thing I did that day was purchase a no contract, pay-as-you-go cell phone for her (in my name) for her to keep with her at all times.  I made sure that it's able to dial 911 in case any emergency arises and also purchased some text messages for her to have in case she really has to make use of them.

Day 3: The next day, the police called my cell phone number (which was the number given when the restraining order was filed) and asked to speak with her.  After she got off of the phone, she told me that when her parents had been informed about the restraining order, they let police know that they wanted nothing to do with their daughter and that she was free to take her things out of the house within the next three days.  This could not take place without a police officer present, so she was told that a police officer would be available to accompany her (and me) to her parents' house to take her belongings out of the house the following day.  She was terrified of even doing this, but I told her that it simply had to be done and that I would be there (in addition to a police officer) so she wouldn't have to worry about her safety.

Day 4: She and I waited down the street from her parents' house until we saw the police officer's car pull up to her parents' house.  The police officer knocked on the door and her mother opened it.  The police officer then came over to us and told us that her mother had said that her daughter could only take her belongings out of her bedroom and no other room in the house.  The police officer had also made sure that nobody else was in the house but her mother and asked if she was okay with her mother being in the house while we moved her stuff out.  She said it was fine and didn't fight her mother on her limiting her daughter to only taking things out of her bedroom, so she and I went into the house and up into her room and began moving her more important, personal belongings out of the room.

On our many trips up and down the stairs of her house, her mother berated her daughter through tears, including several remarks such as, ""I hope you're happy that you're turning down a marriage to sleep with your new boyfriend [me],"" making it clear that her parents had already made the gigantic leap that she and I were in some sort of romantic relationship (I've noticed over the years that within Muslim-majority countries, this is almost always the cultural assumption).  Her mother also made several remarks towards me, including, ""We [she and her husband] always thought of you as a good son and what we'd want our son to be like if we had one.  We never would have expected anything like this from you.  You're a disgrace to your parents.""

Within 20 minutes, we had gotten all of her important belongings out of her room and packed them into my car.  We thanked the police officer for coming with us, then left and came back to my house.

I was planning to try and look for a safe place for her to live on this day, but once we got home, it seemed to finally hit her that her parents were disowning her, so she had an emotional breakdown.  I stayed with her the whole day and helped calm her down and talk her through the situation, letting her know that she hadn't done anything wrong in this situation and that it was her parents who had forced her to take these actions.  Eventually, very late at night, she finally fell asleep.

Day 5: My family was set to come back home the next day, so I knew that I needed to act quickly in order to try and find her a living arrangement because there is no way that my family would be willing to step into a situation like this, especially since it has to do with the daughter of a family (wonderful cultural double standards).  I made some calls and found out that someone was looking for a tenant to rent a very small house in the vicinity of my university/college campus (where I am both pursuing a master's degree and working full-time) which is about 25 minutes away from her parents' and my family's home.  We went to meet with the landlord and we explained the situation to him.  The landlord was kind enough to immediately let her move into the house given the circumstances and waived the first two months' worth of rent for her.  Given the situation and my perfect credit, he said that she could stay there indefinitely and that he'd work with us if any months where paying rent was difficult came up.  We thanked him profusely and then moved her belongings into her new house.

Day 6: My family arrived home and had apparently received a call on their cell phone while away from her parents about what had transpired.  My family chastised me for getting involved in another family's affairs and especially when it came to their daughter (told you, double standards), but I reminded them that they had raised me to act when I saw something wrong and quoted the Hadith ([here](http://www.nur.org/en/islam/nurlibrary/Sahih_Muslim_Hadith_No_79_71172)) always cited to back up that teaching.  They still weren't happy about it and suggested that I back off completely because by getting involved in a situation like this with a man's daughter I was, ""Messing with his *ghirat*[""jealous pride""],"" but I made it clear that I wasn't going to back off and that I would not be telling them anything else about this situation.  They tried to argue with me a bit more (and even hinted that even *they* thought there must some romantic relationship between the two of us), but I wasn't backing off of my position and so they eventually dropped it.  Nobody in my family has spoken to me since.

After that confrontation with my family, I picked up a booklet from the local Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) location that people preparing for driving learner's permits exams use to study and took it over to her at her house so that she could begin studying for the exam so that she could being working her to way to eventually getting a driver's license.  She seemed much happier now that she was somewhat settled.

While at her house, I made a few phone calls and then submitted an application for the Spring 2013 semester (which starts in January 2013) for her to enroll in a local community college's online campus.  She graduated from high school with honors so she would be able to be admitted as an undergraduate to the university/college where I am pursuing my master's degree and am working, but since we're not sure how the situation will play out and for her own safety, we decided that completing two years of community college online before having her transfer to a four-year university would be a better idea; besides, it's also a cheaper option.

Day 7: I spoke to my boss and she said that given the circumstances, she would pull the necessary strings to bypass the usual policy of only hiring currently-enrolled students to work in the office and hire her to literally work alongside me in my office.  I will be picking up the necessary paperwork for her tomorrow when I go into work and taking it to her to fill out.

That's pretty much it so far.  Coming up in the near future will be the courtroom hearing to finalize the restraining order and the fallout from the local Muslim community and my family.  As I said, no family member has spoken to me ever since the confrontation took place yesterday.  Additionally, this upcoming Friday will be the first time that I attend Jumu'ah (Friday congregational) prayers ever since all of this happened.  Given how quickly gossip spreads among people from Muslim-majority countries, who knows what will happen this Friday.

The whole situation has been difficult for many reasons, among them her reluctance to even interact with me as much as she has during this situation.  Her level of practice of Islam is similar to mine in that she is fairly observant of most things but she is not completely strict, either; for example, she doesn't wear her hijab outside every day (only when she feels like doing so) and dresses in common, American clothing, but she always makes sure to wear long sleeves and skirts/dresses.  She's never really had a habit of talking to guys other than me since her family and mine have known each other for so long, but she's almost never been around me alone until this situation occurred and has always made sure at least one other person was around whenever she and I were around each other for any purpose.  At this point, however, she's recognized that the circumstances call for these measures, at least for now.  She does also finally seem to be at least somewhat calm after everything that's happened.

(TLDR; I turned 18, needed to tell my fundamentalist mom I was moving out into my financially independent ex-Muslim life)

Thank you guys for all your advice and support with my plan to get out of my house and leave my family to start my own life.
Things did not go as expected. I started early in the morning, the day after I got back from the UAE. I packed all of my clothes and belongings into plastic bags and dropped them out my window. Using an iPod and my neighbor's free wifi, I asked a friend to come pick them up and bring them to her house. That evening, I had The Discussion with my mom.

I expected her to yell and protest and call names, tell me to get out. Instead, she was very calm. When I told her I was going to college and moving out, she just said ""no, you live here."" It was like she couldn't fathom the idea that I could do anything without her permission. We discussed religion for a while, and she still refused to even acknowledge the possibility that I could be able to leave on my own. She accused me of being a sex addict, leaving Islam just so I could be without sin. She accused me of prostituting myself to get the money to leave. She blamed the devil, the Western world, my dead father's genes, and television.

When she told me I couldn't leave, I asked her ""what if I just walk out the door?"" and she told me she would pin me down, and threatened to get violent. My younger sister was listening from the window and at that point called a friend to pick me up, he said he'd be there in half an hour.

At Maghrib time, my mom ended the conversation to go pray, telling me to go take out dinner. She didn't even consider that I could leave without her letting me. I talked to my sister and found out what she had been getting ready. I took out dinner and sat with my clearly crazy mom. After half an hour, the phone rang, my signal he was there. I told my mom I was going to the bathroom, and walked away. I left from the front door quietly, got in his car, and he drove.

I haven't seen any family members since I left. My mom sent me an email recently telling me that she feels like I killed her. She's told the whole extended family what happened, and I'm a little worried about violence. I'm staying with a friend who isn't telling anyone I'm there, and I'm giving the police a heads up in case I'm reported missing. I'm getting my apartment soon, and I'm working and going to college. I feel free now.

So yeah, that's my story.


TLDR; Broke the news, mom got scarily calm, threatened violence, I escaped, living in hiding, things will be okay.

I'm not gonna kid, there were times where I cried alone in my room just processing everything that's happened. It is hard. But I keep in mind all the encouragement and support I've received from all of you. It kept me going when I thought I had nothing. I am not cutting school; I couldn't do it. It was and still is my refuge. My university has generously offered to assist me in covering living expenses and payment for school. My work supervisor has been more than helpful, she's been very accommodating and we managed to make a deal to make sure I can be self-sufficient enough before my contract ends.

If I had to give advice for anyone who is going through what I went through: keep your head up and learn to be independent. Make sure to have a strong social support system. Someone you can feel confident enough to share your thoughts and be willing to listen. I honestly am grateful to that friend who generously offered me a temporary place to stay when I had no where to go and until I got back on my feet. And for her words of encouragement and keeping me on track when I wasn't clearly thinking and wanted to quit it all and return back there to hug my mother. You will be frustrated, angry, a mixture of emotions... Yes, it will be lonely, scary and frightening because heck, you're in this big world and there are many dangers out there. But you have to leave when the danger is within your home. Home is supposed to be a safe place where you can feel free to express who you are. Home should not be a place where you can't be who you are.

I'm moving on with my life. I am much happier than I was living in my previous conditions. The first month was rough but I made it through.

I'm not sure if I should make a separate post on things I've learned in the process. Would anyone be interested in that?

There was a huge outcry from the Muslim community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Muslim community. If the Muslims won, they could stay in Italy; and if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

The Muslim people met and picked an aged and wise Mufti to represent them in the debate. However, as the Mufti spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Arabic, they agreed that it would be a ""silent"" debate.
On the chosen day the Pope and Mufti sat opposite each other. The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. The Mufti looked back and raised one finger. Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head. The Mufti pointed to the ground where he sat. The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine. The Mufti pulled out an apple. With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Moulana was too clever. The Muslims could stay in Italy.
Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened. The Pope said, ""First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity."" He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God!"" Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us."" He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us."" I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins."" He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin."" He beat me at every move and I could not continue!""

Meanwhile, the Muslim community gathered to ask the Mufti how he'd won."" I haven't a clue,"" the Mufti said."" First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger."" Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Muslims and I told him that we were staying right here!"" ""And then what?"" asked a woman.""Who knows?"" said the Mufti.

Initially, it started as a curiosity to see who the people were that made this community what it is, and all I can say is that the response to the survey has been overwhelming!

From a nearly two year old community with 2,500 members (at the time the survey began), I considered 100 to 150 responses at most would be all I would get. It is now two weeks later, and there are 472 responses. It is more than apparent that there are more of us here than it seems.

Before we get into the nitty gritty, a special thanks also to the mods for plastering the link to the survey around the subreddit!

And sorry for the delay in posting this. My final year of university started this week, and it's as though the last thing they want are happy, well-adjusted students. :(

For the data-addicts who couldn't care less about the commentary, links to the raw data are at the very bottom.

**Comments from respondents**

* *How did you find the ex-Muslim subreddit?*

The majority of subscribers filter through /r/Atheism where they find the /r/ExMuslim link in the sidebar.

(I could have clarified this question further, some people mistook this as a question asking about their view of /r/ExMuslim.)

* *Do you have any comments, criticisms, and/or suggestions for the ex-Muslim subreddit?*

The responses to this are too varied to summarise. I do notice a theme with certain answers, though I'll leave my opinion for the comments section.

Please see the data files linked below for detailed answers to the above two questions.

No, these people are far from being 'liberal'. Real liberals stand for freedom and liberty and human rights, libtards are just confused dumbass college dropout cunts who seem to have a bizarre idea on what the words 'liberal' or 'leftism' actually mean. These cunts give the rest of us liberals a bad name.)

**10 Signs You're a Libtard (and should shoot yourself in the face):**


10. You refer to Islam as a 'race'.

9. You refer any kind of criticism against Islam as 'racism' or 'bigotry' or 'Islamophobia'. Ironically, you also refer any kind of Islamic criticism coming from a Caucasian person as 'racism and bigotry coming from old privileged white males.'

8. You are more sympathetic towards the Imams and Muslims who would rather spit on your human rights than the atheists and liberals and humanists who are fighting for your human rights.

7. You think Islam is a religion of 'peace', or you think the name 'Islam' really means 'peace'.

6. You turn a blind eye when Muslims commit atrocities and practice   barbaric customs in the name of their religion, but are willing to spend an hour writing a 6-page essay just to decry Richard Dawkins simply because he said something bad about Islam.

5. You have a secret desire to convert to Islam, or wear the hijab, or do sawm, or engage in any Islamic practice, '*because it's the cool and edgy Lefty thing to do, and I get to stick it to those Far-Rights!*'

4. You're willing to do a full dissertation on why Christianity is the most evilest, baddest, religion to ever exist, why the Church and the Pope are evil incarnate, and why the western world should eradicate Christianity from the face of the Earth with extreme prejudice, but as soon as somebody mentions Islam, suddenly you're all ""HEY LETS NOT GENERALIZE"" or ""BUT NOT ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS"".

3. You think that having a drinking buddy named Hameed who works at Accounting two floors up makes you an expert on how real Islamic societies actually work.

2. When somebody mocks Islam, draws cartoons of Muhammad, burns the Quran, or does anything that blasphemes against Islam, you're actually angrier than the muslims themselves.

Later on during my Atheism, a Muslim friend told me that, for him, studying the life of Muhammad (SAW) confirmed him (SAW) as the seal of the prophets...naturally I scoffed at this.

Over the few weeks that I spent watching al-Awlaki's (RA) lectures on Youtube, and the lectures of other Sheikhs and speakers, I finally grasped the true essence of Islam, and the beautiful character of Muhammad (SAW).

1343906141.0,68,self.exmuslim,xk3my,You All Were Never Muslims To Begin With And You Don't Know Islam.,agentvoid,78,10,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/xk3my/you_all_were_never_muslims_to_begin_with_and_you/,"Hello.

The title of this post is something most of us have had thrown at us. Normally I roll my eyes and just go back to googling [Batman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WOg3ZE3hNQc). However I thought, I'd just write up a few thoughts on this. Forgive the following rant. 

Sunni, Shia, Ahmadiyya, Khajarite, Sufism, Quranism,etc. Different sects with differing interpretations of Islam. Followers of the different sects need not recognise the others as being Muslims. I am being diplomatic here, ***they can and do kill each other over this***. I guess those who act like this subscribe to the notion - might makes right. A concept organised religion is familiar with.

*Let's move on...*

____________________________
In my experience,most Muslims especially the moderates, say that we should never call some who claims to believe in Allah, etc. a kaafir. I have heard the terms bad Muslim and weak Muslim thrown around instead.

I have heard Muslims say that Bin Laden wasn't following Islam or was misguided. While some would outright declare him as not being a Muslim, there were a significant number who would not comment. It's apparently a big no no to judge someone that way. Only *Allah can judge people* because (let's all say it together) **Allah Knows Best^TM**

Let's take a look at a few scenarios (excluding the previously mentioned sect issue) from the viewpoint of your average Muslim (*not theologians or Islamic scholars*):

* Convert (say a Westerner) who can't understand or read Arabic, isn't well versed on how to pray yet, hasn't changed his/her name, doesn't wear the hijab or any form of Muslim garb, hasn't learned all the basics or read most of the Quran and hadith,etc. Believes in Allah, etc.

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Drinks, has premarital sex, doesn't pray regularly except for Friday prayers. Believes in Allah, etc.

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Has occasional doubts about Allah and Islam. But still believes in Allah, etc.

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Prays 5 times a day. Goes for Friday prayers. Read the Quran. Fasts during Ramadan. Believes in Allah, etc.

**Muslim.**

* Person born into a Muslim family. Prayed 5 times a day. Went for Friday prayers. Read the Quran. Fasted during Ramadan. Believed in Allah, etc.

**Never Muslim.**


Makes total sense!
_________________________________
The Quran mentions punishment in the after-life for apostasy. In the real world, one can face ostracism, imprisonment and even death for apostasy. Most Muslims agree that apostasy is a sin.

So according to most Muslims, do exmuslims (that's us!) leave the religion because:

**A. We are attention whores?**

*Especially the ones still living in the closet.*

**B. We are young rebellious kids?**

*Especially those of us who are college graduates and those married with kids.*

**C. We are bigots who don't like Muslims?** 

*Especially those whose family and friends are Muslims and those married to Muslims.*

**D. We want to drink, eat pork and have premarital sex?**

*Especially those who still don't do any of these things that some ''weak/bad'' Muslims can get away with anyway.*

**E.We enjoy the risk of being ostracised, imprisoned or killed?!**

*Especially those in prison. (Sorry, I can't speak for the dead)*


__________________________________________

If you left Islam (for reasons other than those mentioned above), then you (**retroactively**) were never really a Muslim **(because there's no way Islam can be wrong- only your understanding of it)** *and* you deserve to be punished for leaving the religion.

Some Muslims specify that as long as you don't speak out against Islam - you don't deserve punishment in real life. 

So in summation this is what I think most Muslims say:

**If you claim you are an ''exmuslim'', you are wrong because you never were one in the first place and you should shut up about your views on Islam cause otherwise you may warrant punishment in this life (not to mention the punishment you are going to get anyways in the afterlife).**

Thanks for reading. Sorry for the mess. It's hard getting back into the mind of a theist.

*Sorry that I didn't include stuff like being corrupted by Satan/the West/Jews. It's impossible to cover all the excuses. Hopefully these cover the more common ones held by the average Muslim.*

I must have looked a damn sight in the summer heat with a scarf tied around my neck, long-sleeved shirt, and walking barefoot.

It felt strange, one of the oddest sensations I have ever experienced. It felt like light waves of water washing down my legs, very different from water running down your legs in the shower. That just feels heavy. This was like a brushing of soft silk, a caress barely noticed. But it was cool too, and it made me feel awake and it made me very thirsty. I wanted to drink the wind....

I must have walked for an hour with the goofiest expression on my face...

I am a Israeli Jew (by bloodline) who has recently become a total and complete atheist. I came a long way from yeshiva to where I am today.  
Many of the posts and comments I have read here strike so close to home, it's weird. I spent a while on r/atheism but I felt American Christians really have no clue what a ""fundie"" even is, or what it's like to be completely and totally submerged in religious life. When I read posts there in the likes of ""how to debate my father"" I think *seriously?* The thought of entertaining such an idea is ludicrous to say the least... most people from my past never even considered anything outside the realms of their practice. I am choosing deliberately not to use the term ""faith"" because religious Judaism, like Islam, is orthopraxic- faith almost has nothing to do with it. The life where there is a correct and incorrect way to do EVERYTHING, from the order of food you eat to the way to tie your shoes the the specific times between actions requiring a prayer to the way you're allowed to open a package... we could both go on forever.  
Basically, I couldn't relate to anyone til I found you guys. (r/exjew is very very small, and most there are Ashkenazi, my family is from Afghanistan)

Not a creature was stirring, not even Hamas.

The Ak-47s were hung by the chimney with care,

In hopes that the Eid Moon soon would be there.


:  
The wahabis were nestled all snug in their beds,

While visions of 72 virgins danced in their heads.

And the slave-girl in her ‘kerchief, and I in my prayer cap,

Had just settled our brains for a long winter’s nap.


:  
When out in the sand there arose such a clatter,

I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter.

Away to the window I flew like al-buraq,

Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.


:  
The moon on the breast of the new-fallen sand

Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects at hand.

When, what my wondering eyes should view on the scene,

But a miniature camel, and eight tinny sahabeens.


:  
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,

I knew in a moment it must be Mohammed.

More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,

And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name!


:  
""Now Umar! now, Ahmed! now, Akbar and Usman!

On, Khalid! On, Wajid! on, on Abu Bakr and Furqan!

To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!

Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!""


:  
As dry sand that before the dust storm does fly,

When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky.

So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,

With the sleigh full of weapons, and Mohammed too.


:  
And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof

The prancing and pawing of each little foot.

As I drew in my head, and was turning around,

Down the chimney Mohammed came with a bound.


:  
He was dressed all in a thob, from his head to his foot,

And his clothes were all tarnished with infidel blood and soot.

A bundle of swords he had flung on his back,

And he looked like a peddler, just opening his pack.


:  
His eyes-how they twinkled! his turban how merry!

His hands were like roses, his nose so hairy!

His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,

And the beard of his chin was as white as the snow.


:  
The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,

And the smoke it encircled his head like a wreath.

He had a broad face and a little round belly,

That shook when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly!


:  
He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,

And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself!

A wink of his eye and a twist of his head,

Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.


:  
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,

And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk.

And laying his finger inside of his nose,

And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose!


:  
He sprang to his camel, to his sahabas gave a whistle,

And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.

But I heard him exclaim, ‘ere he drove out of sight,

""Eid Mubarak to all, and to all a good-night!""

I began to question god and religion when I was 11 years old (the year I started wearing hijab). I would stay up all night crying and reading the Quran trying to figure out what's right and what's wrong. I mentioned the problem once hypothetically to my mother and she said it was just a test from god and that satan is trying to lead me astray. So I forbade those thoughts and continued on with my life. I decided it that it doesn't matter if there is a god or not I'll just be the best person I can be and be obedient to make my family happy. 

And so I did. 

I began living the most elaborate lie, if I were to tell anyone that I was secretly not a muslim they would never believe me (not even my non muslim friends). Why I loved my hijab! And prayer is just a form of beautiful meditation!And I believe in it completely! 
I was always at the mosque volunteering and had so many islamic/ quran classes (which I excelled at) that they took all weekend. After having a bad experience questioning something to my parents I never did it again. 

""Don't do this or this or this, it's haram""

""ok I won't""

THE END

How did I deal with it? Well TV wasn't allowed and internet access had to be with the screen in front of them (until college) so I had books. I literally lived through them. Sometimes I felt like I wasn't real, I was a robot smiling and defending a great religion. So many non muslim said that I have completely changed there view on the religion. Someone hates Islam? Just send me to them! I'm so nice, and good, and well educated that I will change their mind!

I dealt with it because I believed I had no choice. Chance made me born into a Muslim family and so I must deal with it. Make the best of the situation and it will all be well. Besides, my leaving will hurt so many people that love me and I can't do that. I can never live with that. So I can just continue ""living"" through my books and in my head. It won't be so bad!

But about three years ago I starting ""daydreaming"" about leaving. I knew I can never tell them so I thought of just disappearing. ( I even thought of ways where I can just fake my own death, sadly I think they would rather know that I died in a tragic accident and went to heaven than know I left the religion). Eventually, these daydreams became more like realistic plans and less like impossible novel-like disappearances. Last summer, I was so close to leaving but I couldn't last minute. I chickened out and decided I would be okay to just keep pretending and maybe slowly drift away from the religion. Eventually it will die out with the on coming generation. 
But I couldn't pretend anymore. Yes, I was scared that I was being selfish by leaving but what really got me what my future. The idea that very soon I will probably get married to a nice muslim man and have nice muslim kids cemented the decision for me. I might not be brave enough to leave for my own sake but I'll be damned if I put my future (not yet existing) children through it.

I'm ready to leave. I have some ideas and some plans and starting to save up money.

But how should I do it? And am I doing the right thing?

Thank you all for reading my life story. I know it's a bit all over the place but It felt so good to get it out (my hands are shaking)

1357847792.0,60,self.exmuslim,16by2h,Something interesting happened in the subway today.,mootjeuh,76,16,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/16by2h/something_interesting_happened_in_the_subway_today/,"So I was riding in the wagon of one of Brussels' metros today, listening to music (via my newly acquired Spotify Premium account, fuck yeah), reading the newspaper and above all, minding my own business.  
But then I started faintly hearing a woman's voice through my headset, and I had it on maximum so I figured that the person speaking must be shouting really loud.  
So I pressed pause and took my headset off, and yes, there was a woman practically screaming. But as it turned out, she was actually preaching and guess what she was preaching?  
Bingo, Islam!  
I listened to what she had to say to the commuters and I figured she wasn't really sure herself what she was talking about. For one moment, she was saying that we have all lived our lives with too much sin and it is time to repent, but don't worry, Islam is a religion of forgiveness, just turn to Allah! Then she started talking about the end of the world, and the signs that Muhammad gave us of its nearing. Some other random ahadith were spouted out of her mouth and also that they (the commuters) will be turned into pigs and monkeys like the ancient Jews.  

So after not being interested anymore I put my music back on and continued reading my trusty newspaper. When it was finally my stop, I again paused the music, took my headset off and stood up.  
As she was right behind me and next to the door, I had no choice but to stand next to her waiting for the car to come to a halt. Then she started speaking to a woman behind me (still shouting, of course) who was wearing a headscarf. She was trying to teach her a lesson about educating her children in Arabic.  
And that's when I had enough as my eardrum was about to explode, so I turned to her and said: ""Women are not supposed to raise their voices in Islam.""  
Then that noisy bitch finally shut her trap. And those around us starting clapping their hands. I then put my headset back on and walked out in the coolest way possible.

1350083154.0,61,self.exmuslim,11e1zc,Rant: I snapped at a muslim girl in class...,QuisCustodietI,67,6,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/11e1zc/rant_i_snapped_at_a_muslim_girl_in_class/,"So I was at university and there's something called ""Islamic Awareness Week"" going on. Unfortunately, it's not about making people aware of Mo's marriage to a 9-year-old, his narcissistic teachings or his war crimes.

The lecturer was late and this girl, without asking any kind of permission, just went in front of the class and took the mic. Then she started talking about Islam - the usual Zakir Naik-esque ""Islam means peace and it's totally compatible with modern science!!!!1111"" bullshit. In fucking accounting class. 

I really wish I could report her to the administration or the ministry of education, but this is Malaysia; they probably would not do anything and it's possible that I would be the one getting in trouble instead.

Back to my story. Half-way through her moronic *lesson*, this atheist ex-muslim friend of mine stands up and asks ""If Islam means peace, why the hell does war follow it everywhere?"". She's shocked and brings up the whole ""politics got involved""-yadda yadda yadda...then they guy says ""but even muhammad lead expeditions against the neighbouring countries and tribes, didn't he?"" (he's my new hero by the way, I'd totally be doing him if I were gay).

The girl is speechless and has to sit down. The lecturer finally arrives after another 5 minutes (phew) and starts the class. After class, the bitch takes the mic again and continues the lesson. Unfuckingbelievable. By now, I want to leave but I also really want to see how this ends. She starts talking and the guy interrupts her again and tells her to answer his previous question!

She starts calling him an ""Islamophobe"" and a ""hater"". Whatever the hell these mean now anyway. I then couldn't help myself and I said ""I see nothing Islamophobic about his question, why won't you answer it?"". She then says she's out of time and has to go to another class - she didn't by the way. Isn't lying a sin or something?

She comes up to me in the cafetaria afterwards and says ""I just checked and your name starts with Muhammad, astaghfirullah you should be on my side in these debates! Not against me!"". I replied ""So I'm supposed to support the person who shares my supposed beliefs instead of the one I think is right?"". She replies ""Of course!"" (can you believe this idiot?)

I then said ""YOU KNOW WHAT? FUCK YOU. I'M AN ATHEIST, YOUR GOD DOESN'T EXIST AND YOUR PROPHET WAS A MORON"". In my mind.

I actually have no death wish so I just said ""I really am not interested in religion so if you could please not talk about it in class or with me, I'd really appreciate it.""

She said ""But the Prophet swallalahualaihiwasalam told us all to do *Dawah*! I can't stop just because you're not interested!""

Face. Palm.

So after we get home, my brother suggests we all read out loud in a circle. We do so, and our cat Bici (pronounced Bee-See) comes along.

As a preface, let me just say that I’m not really in a super good state of mind right now (like you might have guessed), so please excuse any spelling/grammar/conjugation errors. And why am I writing this right now? I want to have this all typed down while it’s still fresh in my memory.  

So after procrastinating about this for almost a month, I hesitatingly decided that today was finally the day. So at about 7:30 pm I went downstairs and found my dad listening to some dude reciting the Koran on tv, and my mom on the phone.  
So I stood there, and waited until she was done talking, and when she was I just kept standing there thinking about what I should say and how. What the possible outcome scenarios will be.  Basically just a million thoughts passing through my head every second.  

I was standing a few meters in front of my mother facing the clock on the wall and at about 8:15 I heard one of the verse that at its end said “For the believers, paradise, and for the disbelievers, hell”. And that’s when I got irritated at the arrogance of that prick reciting and started talking.  

Me: “I have something to say.”  
-Mom: “Yes? :)”  
*I turn around to my dad and he’s looking at me, so I turn back to my mom*  
Me: “You always say that there should be communication, especially between families”  
-Mom: “Yes, that’s true.”
Me: “So now I have something to communicate. I don’t believe in Islam anymore.”
-Mom: “Wha- what?”  
-Dad: “What?”  
Me: “I don’t believe in Islam anymore, this.” *pointing at the verse on the TV screen* “I don’t believe in this paradise or hell anymore”  
*dad stays silent, mother closes her eyes and make a hand gesture to wait a second, hold her heart area*  

Alright so I’m skipping over this part, basically I told my mom to calm down and took her over to her
room. And dad had no reaction, well except for a “hmph” sigh.  

Now my mother and I are sitting on her bed talking. I tell her I’m no longer a Muslim, she starts crying, then I calm her down. And we start discussing why, I tell her because there’s too much fantasy in it, and I would rather believe in proof and facts. Naturally she asks me for what kind of proofs and says that we have proof all around us for Islam. Then I try to explain to her that I don’t believe it’s true just because it says it’s true, I tried to soften the blow by explaining deism (even though I’m not a deist, I’m so sick of lying), that I believe in a creator but not in religion. But she still has trouble understanding that concept, to her it’s either atheism or theism. At a certain point she said to me: “Are you accusing the prophet Muhammad pbuh of being a liar?”  


 That’s when I started a little to despair, I tried to keep calm, focused and composed in general and explain to her that I simply don’t believe in any religion anymore. The discussion went on with her starting to cry again and me calming her and her sobbing that she would say I was always the best Muslim, the brightest and would never do bad stuff. Again, tried to explain that I haven’t change and I’m certainly not going to start robbing banks now, but I’m pretty sure she’ll forget it by tomorrow, if she hasn’t already.  
We finally came to the conclusion that she would try to bring me back with “proof” and “arguments” that “I have to accept if they are the truth”, she was shocked at the idea when I told her that I would counter-argument and said “are you trying to go to war with me?”  

A lot more has happened of course, and all in all, I still didn’t have the balls to say everything I wanted. I fucking hate this, damn this fucking religion, fucking shit I’m too young to be dealing with this crap and my parents not being able to imagine me not being a Muslim.

We are now fighting to get this approved by our SU, who have fought the atheist society in the past, on grounds of insult, racism/islamophobia. They lost that (it was a silly censorship move). Can't do that anymore, I'm brown as fuck, and am about as Islamophobic as drinking Zamzam on Laylat-ul-Qadr while singing Nasheeds.

I'm coming to this thing on a ""support"" and ""educate"" perspective, we will help support current ex-Muslims too scared to come out (or think it's a scary thing to say out loud), as well as bring REAL panel debates about Islam, chaired by strong Muslim leaders and also by ex-Muslim and experts on Islam. No racism arguments, no Islamophobia, only **real debates** that can't be discredited by personality attacks.

We've already got a big event lined up (which I've been selling for months haha), but I've got the ISLAMIC society saying they would love to work with us, providing us speakers.

Sort of helps that I've come out to a bunch of my friends, of which some are old friends who now run Islamic organisations/societies ;)

I am completely dependent on them, so I follow their rules and keep my mouth shut when they say or do things I don't agree with.

Well, today my father walked into my room and told me to get ready to pray, but because English isn't his first language, it sounded to me like he told me to come eat some rice.

I told him I wasn't hungry, but because he never listens to what I say, he thought I was declaring an unwillingness to bend over while his god shoves his omnipotent dick in me.

And he went berzerk.

First he slapped me. Ok, no big deal, I've been slapped before. Sure, my glasses fell off, but I can still see where he is. What's he screaming at me? ""You have to pray, it is important?"" Is that what he was saying when he came in? Maybe if I try to explain the situation he'll understand.

So I sit up. ""I said I'm not --"" damn, another slap? Why does my spit taste like iron? Damn, did my braces cut my cheek? Whatever, it's not that big a cut anyway.

Holy shit, I'm in the air. Holy shit I'm back on the ground. Ok, I'll just make enough space between us and tell him what I thought he said.

""I said I'm not hungry because I thought you said to come eat rice!"" I shout that quickly enough that he has to hear the whole thing.

So I go and ""prepare to pray"" (read: wash out my mouth in the bathroom and blow my nose, making sure to splash some water on my head and feet to seem like I was pure enough for the assfucking his god would soon give me). And he leads the prayer, he in front, I and my brothers behind him.

And we finish up the prayer, and he tries to make up for kicking my ass over a misunderstanding. How? A hug. That's it. A half-assed hug and a lecture about how important it is that I pray, lest he and I burn in hell for eternity, now being sodomized by Satan and not by god.

And I sit here now, my mother supportive of his religiousness, my brothers oblivious to the misunderstanding, and my face stinging and my glasses a little more crooked, typing my story up on r/exmuslim, because there's nobody else I can tell.

And that's why I can never tell my parents about my disbelief. I get my ass handed to me for not wanting rice.

Been reading this subreddit for a couple of months and a redditor for just a bit longer than that. Just finally wanted to make an intro post before I start commenting in case people start asking who this random person is.

So here's my little story: 
A couple of months ago, I gave up. I gave up trying to justify things that went entirely against my personal beliefs. I gave up all these fears that I've been taught to hold. I gave up all these practices that added no value to my life but were meant to 'ensure my place in jannah'. The day it happened, I could not concentrate on anything else. A heavy load had been removed and I felt 'high'.

Some of the catalysts for the change:
I live in South Africa. A very multicultural place. I could not accept that friends of mine who are better people than I am could go to a worse place because of their beliefs.
I was raised a muslim. I could not accept that I am so fortunate to be born into the 'right' religion.

My plans?
Well I have not come out to any family member. And I doubt I ever will voluntarily. However something like marriage will definitely bring it out in the open. Marrying a non-muslim would make it very obvious, and I have no intention of keeping the facade up for a muslim partner either. 

Thankfully I am completing my degree soon and will need to move cities for my profession, giving me some much needed independence and space.

I love my family though and I really wish I could blindly believe just to keep things easier for them. Unfortunately with the information age we are in, it is terribly difficult to be so ignorant.

I started this subreddit 2 years ago for one simple reason: camaraderie. I met exmuslims here and there but I always got the sense that there are many more like us out there who are afraid to go public or who simply don't want to deal with the drama of apostasy in their social circles. 

I'm very happy to see a large number of people subscribed to r/exmuslim. Though we are ""just"" an anonymous group, there is power in numbers, and our influence reaches, and has reached, further than you might expect.

Continue to spread the word, and continue to bring fruitful discussions and material to share, it's been quite the brain food.

Please remember to stay rational and keep hate at bay, no matter how wronged you may feel. The only way to rid this planet of the Islam virus is through a bold, but calm, antidote of civilized discussion.


Many thanks go out to the two most dedicated infidels I know: agentvoid and Big_Brain. They have put in way more effort into improving this subreddit than I have.

akuma87 was one of the more active redditors on this board, and Ash09 and I noticed his enthusiasm and competence, so we decided to make him a mod.

I am financially independent and can arrange alternative housing if needed. I came out more than half a year ago, he was dismissive but he was living overseas in kafir lands so there wasn't much fallout. He never talked about religion later and I let it be. But he came for a visit and I wanted to talk about some other serious issue regarding family, he again was not talking despite promising to earlier. Things got heated, (my fault as I was frustrated for being ignored regarding this for so long) and then towards the end this came out. Now I know what he thinks of me. It's just so shocking and sad and I am actually ashamed of what he said. He like some others claim to be liberal and open minded but in the end this is what they say in anger. I cannot explain the dog eating and piss drinking weirdness. And since when was being an atheist same as being a Jew or being on their side?

1351888195.0,52,self.exmuslim,12j5nc,Fought with my mom today and I feel like this community would understand and let me vent,exmuslimvagina,59,7,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/12j5nc/fought_with_my_mom_today_and_i_feel_like_this/,"I'm an ex-muslim Arab female. My entire life my parents held me back because I was a girl. I had to quit swimming in middle school because ""girls should not have people looking at them in wet tight clothes! haraam! allah will burn every part of your body you show!"" . I was basically under house arrest all the time because my parents didn't want me hanging out with groups of friends that included boys, and would spy on me to make sure I wasn't ""chatting"" online with any male friends. I was constantly screamed at and hit because of things like wearing tshirts or talking to a boy on the phone.

 When it came time to apply to college, my parents told me I would be going to the local university 10 minutes from my house. It's not a great school, and I worked really hard in high school to build up a great resume for college. So I applied to the schools I wanted. I saved up and paid the application fees out of my own pocket and got into several of the schools I applied to, including the top university in my state. 

But my parents refused to let me go. I was a year ahead in school so I was only going to be 17 my first year of college and was still a minor who had to listen to my parents. We fought over it, they refused to listen to me, even though it was only 2 hours away and would cost the same as the closer school because it was in-state tuition. But they said ""girls don't leave home until they're married! when you get married then you can go with your husband'. I ultimately had no choice, or power, and had to go to the university I didn't want to go to.

Now I'm 20. I've gotten a job, work hard, have my own apartment, pay my own rent and bills, have a car, etc. Things are OK for me, except the university I go to is awful. 

First, it's overpopulated. One of the biggest universities in the country. Because of this, I often can't get into classes I want to take because they fill up. I'm getting a 5 year degree when I could have been done in 3. Second, I get paid less at work than students from other universities because their schools are ranked higher than mine. Which means I come to work, do the same exact work, but get paid less because I go to a shitty school.

I was upset yesterday, and when my mother called me she and I talked about it. I mentioned how I was angry that she forced me to go to that university and a small argument ensued. 

Today she calls me saying she's 'very upset' because I don't give her credit. She says that I should thank her and god because thanks to them I am successful. Then she said 'And besides, that was the past, and I've changed. I let you move out and be away from me, didn't I?  I let you work for that company, didn't I?"" 

I flipped out. I was so angry. 

I said 'BECAUSE OF YOU? No, it's not because of you. I'm successful IN SPITE of you. You did everything you could to keep me locked up in your house and force me to go where you wanted and have the friends you wanted me to have. You didn't ""let"" me move out and work and you didn't change. The only difference between then and now is that now I'm an adult with my own income and legal freedom from you, and you no longer have the option of controlling me. I'm not going to thank you, and I'm not going to thank god, for the hard work I did to get away from being oppressed and beaten over religion"" 

She was angry and kept saying ""well you're not grateful, you should be grateful for what you have instead of being angry over the past'

In any other situation, I would agree. But I can't not be angry over the past. I can't forget the time I was with my cousins going to the movies and I called shotgun, and my parents yelled at me saying that when I'm with a male relative,he sits in the front seat and I sit in the back seat because I'm a female. 

 I can't forget my mom calling me a non-virgin slut for using tampons, or allowing me to suffer with severe, crippling cramps every month because she thought it would be ""shameful"" if I went to a gynecologist or took birth control. 

I can't forget how hard I worked to get into a good university only to be forced to go to a shitty one because ""girls don't leave the home""

And now my mother wants to take credit for all of my hard work and say ""see? you're successful because of us! Thank Islam for where you are!""

ugh NO. Never.

Now if you are living in a house where you are being physically abused ignore this and just carry on with your plan. 

Now all of the posts I have seen so far are about young early to mid 20 somethings who just graduated UNI or are still attending in some form or another. Also what is common is the whole ""lifestyle"" argument being used to justify why you are planning on escaping. As an ex-moose who is still in the closet, but managed to move out I know this first hand, but what worries me is most of you are trying to abandon ship in the most idiotic way possible. 

First, many of the posters have little to no savings and are currently either looking for a job or have a dinky part time job that is not even enough to support them while they live with their parents! How do you expect to survive like this? Well guess what you won't make it very far. Not including rent you have to realize you will be paying a lot of cash. I do not care how frugal you are or how great of a coupon hunter you claim to be, things still cost money and if you are not generating an income suitable for survival you will crash and burn faster then a Muslim suicide bomber. Groceries, eating out (everyone always says I won't, but you will at least once a week), utilities and other bills, some sort of transportation cost, and so on. Also don't forget the move itself will cost you a pretty penny. My move alone cost me 200 bucks just to move! (gas for my car, money for a friend who helped me move, I just couldn't let him do it for free, and money on supplies for that first month!)

Finally a lot of you are trying to not only leave your parents, but insult them and ridicule them as you do it. For example I saw a post where a user wanted to scream fuck Islam as he or she was leaving. Brilliant job, let us burn bridges as we leave so when the going gets tough there is no one to turn to! I know living in a strict household can be grueling, but unless your parents literally beat the snot out of you and torture and neglect you then leaving on negative terms is just foolsih! 

I moved out a month ago on excellent terms with my mom, yes she doesn't know about my lack of faith, but hell why should I have to tell her, it is easier to not tell her and let her enjoy her life. (now let the why should we have to hide our truth from them brigade begin. To you I say go ahead and be as honest as you want if you so desire, for me it is better to let people live in ignorance sometimes because it is just easier on everyone!) 

Anyway back to my point, she has helped me set up this entire month and has really been the reason I have been able to survive! 

So for all you ex-mooses so eager to leave home in a fit of rage keep these things in mind.

Have a stable job

Have a nice amount of money saved

AND do not burn any bridges with your family because they will be a great asset as you try and get your life settled. ",(Advice/Help),False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,advice,,True,t3_1ici0x,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1ici0x/for_those_of_you_trying_to_leave_your_families/,

1343842833.0,52,self.exmuslim,xiktm,Over the last year and a half I've helped 3 exmuslims escape their countries. Here are my experiences doing so.,feynbear,63,11,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/xiktm/over_the_last_year_and_a_half_ive_helped_3/,"I guess it all started when I would often join facebook groups supporting anti-blasphemy law causes, and individuals who were being oppressed by blasphemy laws.  General consensus is that signing the petitions and participating in these groups really doesn't help.  I think to a direct sense this is largely true, but I think there is a significant benefit to doing so.  The benefits are that it raises the visibility of the issue, and  creates a community that can offer support and advice on ways to really make a difference.  

After joining a group in support of [Waleed Hasayin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walid_Husayin) I started reading the blog of a fellow member of the group.  To my horror he himself was in a terrible situation in his country.  His atheism had become publically known, and he was facing physical assault at both home and at school,  not only from the students, but the teachers as well.  He was forced to drop out of school, and only his mother's begging stopped his father from beating him too severely.  The situation became worse as he began to receive credible death threats from people who knew in which general area he lived.  He was terrified that he would be killed. 

Eventually he was forced to go into hiding.  This is where I could help. When a person goes into hiding it becomes exceedingly difficult to financially support oneself.  Not only this, the cost of food and a months rent would be a severe burden on people living in the country.  Fortunately a day's pay for me would cover a months expense for him.  This contribution freed him up to do research on applying for asylum, and eventually apply for it in Switzerland (which allows you to apply from out of country).  

It is very tough for people in this situation to get a travel visa, not only because its naturally tough to be approved, but because without the support of your family, these exmuslims might not have access to the proper documentation to apply, even if they would be approved.  

After a few months the application for asylum went through and this exmuslim was able to leave the country.  It's still a rough place to be in, not only does he still receive death threats from the immigrant community in Europe, his life is pretty much on hold.  He is not allowed to return to schooling, or have a job until his case for asylum is reviewed and he is granted it.  Luckily he documented the threats against him well even recording phone calls threatening his life, so his case is very strong and he is expected to be granted it.  This individual also happened to be an active blogger among secularists living in muslim majority countries, and through his connections I was also able to help out another few exmuslims in equally terrifying situations with funds to stay in hiding and plane tickets once their escape had been planned.

From my point of view I could not have gotten more value for my dollar, to be able to help 3 people from a position where they were facing levels of oppression that left them unable to function in society, to a position where they can openly express themselves without too much danger.  It is, hands down, the best use I've found for my money.

Anyway this is just a basic overview of my experiences and I'd be happy to answer any questions anyone might have about this or fill in details if anyone is interested in any aspect of it.

Also for clarification, I was never muslim - my parents raised me in a small East Indian Cult - so I've never really felt a particular connection to any of the ex communities (there is none in this cult), and just bounced around and hung out with the whichever atheist community that was in my reach.

EDIT: I also forgot to mention that after the first exmuslim I helped went into hiding, several lawsuits were brought against him under the countries rules against insulting islam, also another individual I helped had previously served a prison sentence for insulting Islam.  This is an additional terrifying aspect of the situation.  Despite having serious threats against their lives, these individuals are completely unable to seek protection with their government, who would sooner prosecute them even if they haven't insulted Islam.  Since they are no longer muslim there is a mistrust against them, and any individual can simply claim they insulted Islam and there is a very low bar for what can be considered insulting to Islam.",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,1343858442.0,,,True,t3_xiktm,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/xiktm/over_the_last_year_and_a_half_ive_helped_3/,

None of this wishy washy stuff. I'm coming out to my brother in an hour. Just finishing my halaal sandwich, showering, and telling him. As a non Muslim not gay!

I was speaking to a pretty high flying lawyer yesterday, who happens to be gay. He was telling me how it was for them 30 years ago.

He said the MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR THE LGBT MOVEMENT WAS THAT PEOPLE CAME OUT. IT BECAME NORMALISED. 

They were joking about how they all KNEW that secularism would become the norm, but homophobia would never even change. They were joking about how actually, the opposite has happened, with secularism STILL being an issue, while homophobia is generally not accepted.

Peace out.

(for those who have seen this message on the London group, yes I'm the same guy)

----------------------

**Update:**

So I told him. His face dropped really quickly and he went pretty quiet. Like he'd been gut punched. I can tell he was really shocked.

He understood why I told him, that I want him to know before I tell my Dad, which will be harder. That I'm doing a lot of shit in the area, and people may try to get to me through my family.

He said he thinks I should speak to other people who are smarter in Islam, but I said I had.

He dealt with it how I thought he would, he is Muslim, but relatively liberal in some ways (although he wants Sharia law eventually). Although I didn't expect him to be that visibly shaken.

He ended with an interesting thing: ""I sort of knew, I guess"".

Anyways, thanks to everyone here and on Reddit for everything.

I've now sort of got his support, even if I don't know how he's going to process this in the coming days.

It'll help possibly patch things up with Dad, when tell him. Or at least, he'll understand that I can't be excommunicated completely as that would raise alarms with our mom.

We both agreed that our Mom can never know. She would literally either die, or get mentally unstable or both.
 
Now, let's start helping each other.

Like a good Muslim girl, I had an arranged marriage. Turned out he was Muslim by name only.  Told my mom ""He says he drinks"" and she replies ""you can change him."" Everything I learn about him, I don't like, but I'd agreed after 1 meeting, now I'm stuck.  Spent most of the marriage hounding this kind and funny man to become a better Muslim, to pray, banned alcohol from crossing our doorstep (he drank his beer on the stoop :) ).  

Our kid is born, he dies and shit turns serious.  I hear descriptions of the day of judgment, how you are running around with scales, your good deeds weighed against your bad and I'm certain his good deeds (though a good person, not a good muslim) would not outweigh the bad.  

Was personally never terrified of the afterlife, but in the midst of grieving, I'm told I can help better his chances by doing 'good' works in his name. After his jinaza, I watch as they carry him away in the coffin, and I say quietly ""that's it"" but someone overhears and tells me ""No, that's not it...""  and tells me all the ways that I could help his chances in the afterlife (something I hadn't even considered).  

So I throw myself into it, head on.  I save up money that I can ill-afford so I can send a good Muslim to make the Hajj for him.  I do extra prayers and say it is for him.  I volunteer my time and money to the community, again, saying its for him.  I raise my kid to say prayers for him (was told her prayers would have special power).  Scrubbing the dirty floors of the masjid bathroom, I still wasn't certain of his chances - I couldn't see the correlation between me cleaning the masjid and his character.  

I was a full blown lunatic for a while - lost all connection to my rational side.  When I was losing a bit of my conviction, I turned to the Quran. I needed god to speak to me, to tell me he wasn't bound for hell, that we could be a family again.  So, after decades of reciting jibberish, imagining the undoubtedly wise things I was reciting, I finally sit down to read for understanding what Allah had actually said. Every verse acted like a tiny pinprick against this balloon of belief I'd surrounded myself with.  I couldn't believe the amount of threats this god issued, the lack of wisdom it imparted, the inanity.  THIS is what I was slaving away for?  THIS?  

Happy ending: I became an atheist 1/3rd of the way through the quran.      

BTW: all is well now, I hate, *fucking hate,* pity - I had decided to put my career on hold to raise our kid because he made enough for us to live on comfortably, and that put us in some discomfort when he died, but with the help of family and a clear atheist head, I went back to school, now have a job that will allow me in a few months more to work from home.  My daughter has an amazing support system, both his family and mine, we don't have pity parties for her, the phrase of the day is always ""All living things die"" - it just happens that her father was a living thing.  It would have been nice had he lived, but she is **NOT** eternally damaged because he isn't. Capice?

Jigs McDonald, NHL Hall of Fame broad caster speaking in Orillia, Ontario, says, ""I am truly perplexed that so many of my friends are against another mosque being built in Toronto. I think it should be the goal of every Canadian to be tolerant regardless of their religious beliefs.
Thus the mosque should be allowed, in an effort to promote tolerance.

That is why I also propose that two nightclubs be opened next door to the mosque, thereby promoting tolerance from within the mosque. We could call one of the clubs, which would be gay, ""The Turban Cowboy"", and the other a topless bar called ""You Mecca Me Hot.""

Next door should be a butcher shop that specializes in pork, and adjacent to that an open-pit barbecue pork restaurant, called ""Iraq o'Ribs.""

Across the street there could be a lingerie store called ""Victoria Keeps Nothing Secret "", with sexy mannequins in the window modeling the goods.

Next door to the lingerie shop there would be room for an adult sex toy shop,* *""Koranal Knowledge "", its name in flashing neon lights, and on the other side a liquor store called ""Morehammered.""

All of this would encourage Muslims to demonstrate the tolerance they demand of us, so their mosque issue would not be a problem for others.""

I'm sorry. I'm sorry as a 6 year old girl, you had to be taken away from your family for the sick sexual joy of a 60/70 year old pedophile. I'm sorry it was done in the name of a religion associated with war, hate mongering and violence. I never realized your plight until today.

Today a 2nd cousin of mine turned 6. As I was pushing her on her swing, trying to make her laugh, helping her arrange her toys and encouraging her to eat everything she served on her plate, I remembered you Aisha. I cannot imagine such a tiny little girl having to go through marriage. I cannot imagine such a tiny little girl forced into sexual intercourse just because she was married to the man who proclaimed he had heard the word of god. I cannot imagine my little cousin born during your time. The horrors she would have to go through. I am thankful she has an amazing childhood, full of toys, learning and happiness. I am sorry you lost yours. 

Aisha, you may not understand what I am saying, you may not agree to it as your years of brain washing has made you intolerant of different opinions other than your husband's. It closed your mind to never see things for what they really were. But if you were here right now, you would understand. If you were here right now, we could save you, we could restore your innocence. We could have given you a normal life.

My little cousin is lucky. She's lucky to be born to liberal parents in a non-Muslim country. She's lucky she doesn't have to go through the things you went through and I have never realized the extent of such horror until today when I couldn't bear the thought of my cousin having to go through what you did.

Sometimes even though I know it's not possible and I am very skeptical about it, I hope a paradise exists in the afterlife. I hope you are there Aisha. I hope you were given everything that was taken away from you at such a young age. I hope a paradise exists for everyone during the prophet's time and after who were brutally persecuted in the name of religion.

I'm sorry Aisha. I'm sorry you could not have been born during a better time. I'm sorry to everyone who suffered massive injustice. I hope at least in death, in the non-existence of life and the final end of your conscience, you are at peace.

Your's Sincerely

An Ex-Muslim.

1376327633.0,51,self.exmuslim,1k7u3v,Why Muslim women are required to wear the Hijab.,wazzym,62,11,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1k7u3v/why_muslim_women_are_required_to_wear_the_hijab/,"If you ask a Muslim why Muslim females wear the Hijab (veil) the reason given is usually one of two (or a mixture of both):

They are obeying a command from Allah as given in the Qur'an; it is a matter of piety.

They are protecting their modesty by dressing this way instead of showing their body off for everyone to see.


**Qur'an Ayahs Regarding the Hijab**

* [Qur'an 24:31](http://quran.com/24/31)  Yusuf Ali:And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; **that they should draw their veils over their bosoms** and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss.


* [Quran 33:59](http://quran.com/33/59) 

* Yusuf Ali: O Prophet! Tell thy wives and daughters, and the believing women, that they should cast their outer garments over their persons (when abroad): that is most convenient, that they should be known (as such) and not molested. And Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.



The first verse above states that the purpose is to hide women's beauty from men. The second verse makes it clear that it is to prevent molestation/harassment whilst traveling. We also do not find any such requirement for Muslim men. Why is this? What are the possible explanations for this?

* Women's beauty is so enticing that men are unable to control themselves if they see an uncovered female - This cannot be right because women do not have to cover themselves in front of those males to whom they are related.

* Women are not attracted to men - Even the casual observer knows this is untrue - the vast majority of women are not asexual.

* Women have more self control than men - This may very well be the case, but only with the caveat that 'men' refers to Muslim men.

The current perception in Islamic society is that an unveiled woman is asking to be sexually harassed or assaulted. Although not a guarantee, they believe that the wearing of a veil is added protection against the chance of assault. However as we look at the ahadith, we find that none of the above reasons are correct as we see when studying the revelational circumstances of these verses. The Hijab verses were sent down in response to a specific situation occurring at the time.

**Ahadith Regarding the Hijab**

* Narrated `Aisha: The wives of the Prophet () used to go to Al-Manasi, a vast open place (near Baqi` at Medina) to answer the call of nature at night. `Umar used to say to the Prophet () ""Let your wives be veiled,"" but Allah's Apostle did not do so. One night Sauda bint Zam`a the wife of the Prophet () went out at `Isha' time and she was a tall lady. `Umar addressed her and said, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda."" He said so, as he desired eagerly that the verses of Al-Hijab (the observing of veils by the Muslim women) may be revealed. So Allah revealed the verses of ""Al-Hijab"" (A complete body cover excluding the eyes). http://sunnah.com/bukhari/4/12

* Narrated `Aisha: (the wife of the Prophet) `Umar bin Al-Khattab used to say to Allah's Messenger () ""Let your wives be veiled"" But he did not do so. The wives of the Prophet () used to go out to answer the call of nature at night only at Al-Manasi.' Once Sauda, the daughter of Zam`a went out and she was a tall woman. `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her while he was in a gathering, and said, ""I have recognized you, O Sauda!"" He (`Umar) said so as he was anxious for some Divine orders regarding the veil (the veiling of women.) So Allah revealed the Verse of veiling. (Al-Hijab; a complete body cover excluding the eyes). (See Hadith No. 148, Vol. 1) http://sunnah.com/bukhari/79/14


* 'A'isha reported that the wives of Allah's Messenger () used to go out in the cover of night when they went to open fields (in the outskirts of Medina) for easing themselves. 'Umar b Khattab used to say:
Allah's Messenger, ask your ladies to observe veil, but Allah's Messenger () did not do that. So there went out Sauda, daughter of Zarn'a, the wife of Allah's Messenger (), during one of the nights when it was dark. She was a tall statured lady. 'Umar called her saying: Sauda, we recognise you. (He did this with the hope that the verses pertaining to veil would be revealed.) 'A'isha said: Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, then revealed the verses pertaining to veil. http://sunnah.com/urn/253970

* This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Ibn Shihab with the same chain of transmitters. http://sunnah.com/urn/253980

In short, the sequence of events as laid out in the ahadith are as follows:

* 1 Umar repeatedly asks Muhammad that Allah should reveal verses for the Qur'an pertaining to the veiling of women.

* 2 No such revelation is sent down.

* 3 Umar follows Muhammad's wives one night when they go out to relieve themselves (go to the toilet) and calls out to Muhammad's wife Sauda.

* 4 Sauda goes home in a state of embarrassment and relates to Muhammad what has happened.

* 5 Allah then reveals the hijab verse as Umar had wanted all along.

Of course this brings up some obvious questions:

* If Muhammad is just a messenger, relating Allah's word, why did Umar ask Muhammad for the hijab revelation? Why didn't he just pray to Allah and ask directly?

* No revelation was sent down until Umar spied on Muhammad's own wives. Why did Umar do this? How did he know (or at least suspect) it would be successful? Why does Allah care about toilet privacy so much that he revealed a verse pertaining to all Muslim women that will ever live?

A common apologetics tactic for this is that Allah was waiting for Umar to do this so that the situational revelation could come down. However this is not mentioned anywhere, thus there is no evidence for it. Moreover, Umar confirms that he came up with the idea first and then Allah ""agreed with him""

**Allah Agrees with Umar**

* Narrated Anas: `Umar said, ""I agreed with Allah in three things,"" or said, ""My Lord agreed with me in three things. I said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Would that you took the station of Abraham as a place of prayer.' I also said, 'O Allah's Messenger ()! Good and bad persons visit you! Would that you ordered the Mothers of the believers to cover themselves with veils.' So the Divine Verses of Al-Hijab (i.e. veiling of the women) were revealed. I came to know that the Prophet () had blamed some of his wives so I entered upon them and said, 'You should either stop (troubling the Prophet () ) or else Allah will give His Apostle better wives than you.' When I came to one of his wives, she said to me, 'O `Umar! Does Allah's Messenger () haven't what he could advise his wives with, that you try to advise them?' "" Thereupon Allah revealed:-- ""It may be, if he divorced you (all) his Lord will give him instead of you, wives better than you Muslims (who submit to Allah).."" (66.5)
http://sunnah.com/urn/41650

* Narrated `Umar: I said, ""O Allah's Messenger ()! Good and bad persons enter upon you, so I suggest that you order the mothers of the Believers (i.e. your wives) to observe veils."" Then Allah revealed the Verses of Al- Hijab. http://sunnah.com/urn/44680

Ibn Umar reported Umar as saying:
My lord concorded with (my judgments) on three occasions. In case of the Station of Ibrahim, in case of the observance of veil and in case of the prisoners of Badr. http://sunnah.com/urn/259030

How can the Qur'an be the text that was in existence since before the world began, if Allah is taking suggestions for its content from Muhammad's contemporaries? It appears however, that Umar was a serial toilet-place loiterer, because after the revelation of the verses he had so wanted, he was at it again

**Umar Spies Again**

* Narrated Aisha: Sauda (the wife of the Prophet) went out to answer the call of nature after it was made obligatory (for all the Muslims ladies) to observe the veil. She was a fat huge lady, and everybody who knew her before could recognize her. So `Umar bin Al-Khattab saw her and said, ""O Sauda! By Allah, you cannot hide yourself from us, so think of a way by which you should not be recognized on going out. Sauda returned while Allah's Messenger () was in my house taking his supper and a bone covered with meat was in his hand. She entered and said, ""O Allah's Messenger ()! I went out to answer the call of nature and `Umar said to me so-and-so."" Then Allah inspired him (the Prophet) and when the state of inspiration was over and the bone was still in his hand as he had not put in down, he said (to Sauda), ""You (women) have been allowed to go out for your needs."" http://sunnah.com/urn/44730

* A'isha reported that Sauda (Allah he pleated with her) went out (in the fields) in order to answer the call of nature even after the time when veil had been prescribed for women. She had been a bulky lady, significant in height amongst the women, and she could not conceal herself from him who had known her. 'Umar b. Khattab saw her and said: Sauda, by Allah, you cannot conceal from us. Therefore, be careful when you go out. She ('A'isha) said: She turned back. Allah's Messenger () was at that time in my house having his evening meal and there was a bone in his hand. She (Sauda) cline and said: Allah's Messenger. I went out and 'Umar said to me so and so. She ('A'isha) reported: There came the revelation to him and then it was over; the bone was then in his hand and he had not thrown it and he said:"" Permission has been granted to you that you may go out for your needs."" http://sunnah.com/urn/253950

Apparently, Umar wasn't satisfied once he had gotten the Hijab verses he eagerly bothered Muhammad about. He wanted women to be completely unrecognizable.

**Reasoning on the Hijab**

A common claim by Muslims and apologists is that the Hijab protects women against unwanted sexual attention from men. Well known apologist Dr. Zakir Naik takes this line of reasoning in his defense of the hijab mandate. Before evaluating this claim we must examine a few more ahadith:

http://sunnah.com/urn/254160
http://sunnah.com/abudawud/34/88

Evaluating the ""Protection"" Claim
Given the fact that the verses were first revealed after Umar verbally harassed Muhammad's wives while they were going to the toilet, and that Muhammad told women to wear the veil even in the presence of a eunuch, we must conclude that the veil is only intended to prevent men from evaluating the physical attributes of females. Since eunuchs have no sexual desire, the claim that it is to prevent sexual molestation and not just gossip/verbal harassment is scripturally invalid.

Another interesting thing to note is that all of the verses and ahadith examined so far are to do with Muslim men harassing Muslim females. Thus Allah has revealed this verse to protect the believing women from the believing men.

Furthermore, certain studies carried out in the Muslim world have proven that the widely-held belief that a veil is added protection against the chance of assault is actually false:

1) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2agS_5F0iAg) 

2) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfJ89cdRfQ

3) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSfJ89cdRfQ

**Different Types of Veiling**

There are other ahadith that talk of the 'verses of al-hijab' but these are concerning a different type of hijab (veil) with, of course, a different set of revelational circumstances

http://sunnah.com/urn/44690

http://sunnah.com/urn/44700

http://sunnah.com/urn/44710

http://sunnah.com/urn/44720

http://sunnah.com/bukhari/67/101

http://sunnah.com/bukhari/79/12

We see that in addition to the personal hijab, a 'house hijab' is also required to separate the women of the house from visitors; in the form of a separating, opaque screen. Again as we see above this was a situational revelation. Muhammad was annoyed that people stayed and chatted with his wives after having dinner at the house, so Allah revealed a verse requiring a separation to put a damper on communication, thereby meaning guests do not stay as long before and after dinner. The above verses are not pertinent to the type of hijab being covered in this article, but have been presented to further highlight the silly circumstances of many of these situational revelations; also to acknowledge that 'hijab' as mentioned in the Qur'an and ahadith do not always refer to the same thing.


**Conclusion** 

The reason that Muslim women wear the hijab today is not a spiritual one, nor is it a matter of piety. Covering the hair/face cannot be considered an act of modesty because Muslim men are not required to cover theirs. The sole reason they do it is because Umar bin Al-Khattab, a companion of Muhammad, wished that Muhammad would reveal verses from Allah requiring women to wear it. When Muhammad did not oblige, Umar did not consider praying to Allah for assistance. Umar knew he had to make it personal for Muhammad himself in order to bring the revelation down. He followed Muhammad's wives out when they went to go to the toilet and made his presence known. When Muhammad heard of this, the revelation that Umar had so wanted was sent down from Allah. Umar knew where these revelations were really coming from, which is why he went to Muhammad and harassed his wives instead of asking Allah.

Although the revelational circumstances for the hijab may seem comical, the consequences that we can see to this day, are not. The requirement for the hijab has had the effect of placing full responsibility for Muslim-male self control onto the females - freeing the men of responsibility for their actions if they see an unveiled woman. Lack of self control is not an inherent attribute to men, because men in non-Islamic societies do not have such self control issues; when it is rare to see a woman covered so in these societies. The hijab's purpose, as revealed and to this day, is designed to protect Muslim females from the now acceptable behavior of Muslim males; behavior which has been deemed socially acceptable precisely because of the requirement of Muslim females to wear the hijab.

I mean I get why you'd be angry, you were probably suffering from years of coercion of believing something you were not comfortable with, but do you guys really think that this is what Islam is all about? 

**First of all, I would like to say that I am not here to attack anyone's opinion or try to convince them that what they are doing is nonsense or that they should *burn in hell*. I just want to figure out which direction this subreddit is going to**


I grew up in a strictly-religious family, and I am not going to lie, I have had days where I hated to pray, fast, etc... But as I grew apart from my family, and found inner peace on my own. I pray/fast whenever I want to, but I do slack off sometimes. However, I still believe in the religion. I also believe that Islam is not all about coercion and aggression. I know my parents were wrong, but they didn't get the right education like I've got. I believed all this on my own. 

Anyway, my question is, I assume that most of you has been exposed to the Quran and books about Islam, and I should believe that most of you understand what the religion is all about. However, I noticed that most of are actually angry at their parents, not the religion. But this has extended into bashing that religion instead of explaining the real cause of all this anger. **Again** I'm not saying that all of you are wrong into leaving the religion, but, is it really fair to insult Mohammad PBUH, the Holy Book, and Allah? You might not believe in them, but do you really think they are to be blamed and scorned at for the troubles caused in your personal life? 

The reason I'm asking this is because I've ran into countless posts about how westerners believe that all Muslims and Arabs are terrorists and bad people. I don't completely blame them because they don't know the whole story, unlike some people here. I believe that most of you are either Arabs or of Middle-Eastern background, so I am sure that you know your own people more than westerners do, keeping religion aside. So does it not upset you to see vulgar posts about the Prophet or Arabs in general? Do you honestly believe this is what Islam is about? Is every Arab you meet like some of the picture portrayed in here?

This is an update to the post I submitted about a week ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/19nvmx/so_i_just_came_out_to_my_parents/

So, like the previous case, I'm not in the best of states of minds right so please do excuse any errors you might find.  

Here goes: today I got home early, because I only had work and no school, good thing. When I got home- err. Perhaps it's better to say how my parents reacted to my whole coming out. They were pretty okay with it I guess, if that includes slowly dying from the inside.  

My mother said that she'll do anything to make me ""come back"" even though it'll take all of her energy and all of her years, even years. Yes she said that. My dad just ignores me and each time he sees he tells me that I'm too ignorant to make such a ""decision"".  

Well, back to today's story. So when I got home and started eating dinner with my mom while my father was watching TV. I casually mentioned that I quit my job, she asked why and I said that I wanted to go on a vacation trip to Japan (which is true).  
Pause, the reason why I said vacation is because I'm a coward, I couldn't tell them I was moving out so I decided to go with a vacation in the coming two weeks, while the actual trip to Japan won't be happening until June.
Play, she looked at me with a shocked expression, much like the one she gave me when I told I wasn't a Muslim. But not that hardcore of course.  
So now we skip through stereotypical talks of how they are idolaters, all of those Asians think Buddha is god and that they only eat monkeys and dogs. Somehow they had completely forgotten that:  
a) I'm not a Muslim anymore, so religion doesn't matter to me
b) I'm a vegetarian, which I've already told them before my coming-out.  


The conversation ends with my mom pushing me to go to the USA there, because she has her two cousins there who are both doctors and have big houses and horses and stuff. Instead of going to Japan where I will be with people I don't know in a land full of idolaters no less. So I told her I'd think about it, because it seemed a little tempting to do a Japan-USA trip, but as I was searching for ticket prices online my dad called me downstairs.  

There I saw my father putting his coat on with my mother sitting on the couch holding her head and heart with a blood pressure measuring device next to her (my mother's side of the family has a history of unstable blood pressure, hers it too high, mine is too low). My dad then tells me that he's taking her to the ER because she's not feeling well. He goes outside to take the snow off of the car before leaving.  

So as she's waiting for him I ask her if she wants to go to her room, and I help her get there because she couldn't even stand up on her feet. She lies down on her bed and I try to begin to ask her what happened. She just replies ""do you really not know why I'm like this?"". She says that when I came out to her she almost died and that it's a miracle that she survived, and now this new shock of wanting to go to Japan apparently sent her over the edge. I ask her what she wants from me, what she wants me to do, she doesn't answer. I try to stay as calm as possible and hold her hand while my dad's outside. Get her a glass of water and stuff. She also said that ""that news"" was ""just like someone told me that you had cancer or an accident or died"".


Then when my father's finally ready I walk her outside in the snow in my t-shirt and sandals and see them drive off. When I get inside I go up to my desk and just sit and hold my head for thirty minutes and think of what to do. I already sacrificed to much to get here, and I was at the point at either I sacrifice myself for my parents' sake, or my parents for my own sake. And myself includes all of the 38hrs/week work I've done and money earned from it and spent on my apartment preparing to move out.  


And that's when I do it, the choice that will probably keep me awake this whole night. I stand up, take out my suitcase and fill it up with all of my close, conserving as much space as possible. I put my laptop in its bag, my Windows 8 tablet in my schoolbag, passport, birth certificate, everything I need (at least that's what I think). And that's when I sit back down with a blank piece of paper and a pen. I try to explain in word what I've been through and what I'm going through right now, I try to explain with words, and tears in my eyes that I'm not trying to kill them but clearly only my wanting to go on a trip is making them sick. I try to explain that I want to keep contact and that I love them and that this is not farewell. Basically I try to pour my heart out, as they say. I finish the goodbye letter with two full sheets.  

Put my clothes on, take my bags, kiss my cat Chanel goodbye for what I hope isn't the last time, I'm always the one that feeds her. And go outside, it's 10:30 pm, -10° C., not that cold but there's a snow storm, and I walk the one kilometer street that leads to the bus stop, wait 30 minutes, the bus comes (all of this with my phone switched off because I couldn't handle it if they called me then) I step in and ride towards Brussels. Get to the city, take the metro. At 00:45 get to my stop and wait for the bus, get in the bus and step off at the terminus. Now I'm at 600m from my new apartment that I've been preparing for the last two months. Get my keys, open the door (get on the floor), and see that I'm alone. It's dark, I can't see anything, forgot where the switch was, and I'm alone.  


Now I'm at my new desk in my new apartment in Brussels. Everything I ever wanted from the start right? Ever since I became an atheist right? Then why do I feel like I want to cry, but I also feel like a person like doesn't even deserve to cry. You know what's worse than being a closeted ex-Muslim in an oppressive family? Being with a family that loves you, loves you so much that they literally go to the ER so much they can't accept who you are. Or I don't know, what do I know? I might be wrong, I'm just a kid after all.

During my hiatus from here, I’ve spent a fair bit of my waking hours immersing myself in the works of many philosophers; some ridiculed, some celebrated. Names such as Albert Camus,  Jean-Paul Sartre, Søren Aabye Kierkegaard and the infamous Friedrich Nietzsche went from being deceased, easily quotable figures to hard-won allies along the lonely and arduous journey towards recovery.

In my readings I cannot help but draw some comparisons and parallels with the philosophical implications I’ve come across, and the better part of the Islamic thinking that has been imposed upon me as I grew up in a Wahhabist society.

Take for instance, one of Camus’ more recognizable works: [**The Myth of Sisyphus.**](http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Sisyphus-Other-Essays/dp/0679733736) For the uninitiated, Sisyphus is a fairly well-known character in Greek mythology who was condemned by the Gods to a truly pointless task: rolling a rock up a mountain. The pointlessness of the task becomes even more pronounced everytime Sisyphus actually gets to the top of the mountain, because the rock would eventually just roll down the mountain due to its own weight. Sisyphus would then have to roll the rock up the mountain again…and again…and again…ad infinitum through all eternity.

This is a kind of symbol to what Camus famously refers to as: **The Absurd.** As you might be able to slightly sympathize with Sisyphus’ plight, one cannot help but notice the sheer absurdity of a lifetime filled with nothing but futile labor.

Sounds [**familiar**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salah), doesn’t it?

The notion of the absrud is a special one. While it’s not exactly a technical term, it’s very important to be able distinguish it from what might refer to as “ridiculous” or “silly”. For example, you might watch an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, and occasionally find the concept of a sentient sea sponge that befriends a Texan, underwater-dwelling squirell to be quite ridiculous. You might go out for a walk in the middle of the night and notice someone wearing sunglasses for fashionable reasons rather than practical ones, something which most people would agree to be rather silly.

Camus’s notion of the absurd is one that has overtaken modern sensibilities. It is a metaphysical thesis suggesting that the human understanding of the absurd is in fact a confrontation: a confrontation between two sides of the human mind. On one side you have the “rational” mind; a mind that expects justice, a sense of social fairness, and one that expects for the universe to be comprehensible. On the other side you have a mind that most people may already harbor; a mind that already knows the blatantly obvious: that the universe just doesn’t care.

You might argue that it is part of human nature to care about each other. As many philosophers have argued, we are born with a sense of compassion, sympathy and pity. Without having much choice in the matter, we project these senses onto the universe, expecting it to fulfil our demands and reciprocate our understandings of justice and fairness. To use a simple example, we expect evil to be punished. Acts of kindness should be rewarded. This raises the arguably ancient problem of evil, one that goes back to the middle ages. The fact that virtue is not always rewarded. The all too obvious fact that evil deeds sometimes go away unpunished. This problem has always proved to be quite a conundrum to theological thinkers. However, without even alluding to religion, one can argue that dealing with evil in everyday life is actually a problem for all of us.

The absurd is this recognition that we have certain demands and expectations from the world around us, yet the universe just doesn’t care.

In the end of one of Camus’ brilliant works, [**The Stranger**](http://www.amazon.com/Stranger-Albert-Camus/dp/0679720200/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359596729&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+stranger), the story’s main protagonist Morseau comes to the realization that universe is unfair and says: “It feels so brotherly”. What he is essentially saying is that the universe is indifferent; it just is what it is, and that upon reflection, even *he* is just who he is, and intrestingly enough, he accepts that.

There is a sense in which one might say the absurd would cease to be a problem if we believe in God. The truth is, the absurd would *still* exist even with the existence of God. One could even argue that the problem of evil is now exacerbated and even more pronounced in the face of God. We have certain expectations from him, and he just doesn’t seem to deliver.

Camus even famously says: “Even if there were a God, it wouldn’t matter”.

I personally think that understanding these philosophical arguments and how they stack up against the Islamic schools of thought can be an essential, if not outright crucial part of the ex-Muslim's journey towards making sense of the world again. As such, I will be contributing these essays everyday for the next couple of weeks, with the ultimate aim of encouraging everyone to be able to cultivate an insatiable appetite for trying to answer some of life's most pressing questions...especially upon the realization that most of the answers you have been given as a young Muslim have been patently and demonstrably false.

I hope that you will come away from these essays with not only a better understanding of the universe around you, but with the knowledge and the tools that will help you gain an invaluable appreciation of your relatively brief, fleeting, yet immesurably precious moments of existence.

I will be covering a wide range of subjects, but please feel free to suggest anything that will spark the sort of exchange that everybody can walk away smarter from.",Question/Discussion,False,self,t5_2s7k2,1359597851.0,discussion,,True,t3_17log7,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/17log7/islam_and_the_absurd_part_i_introduction/,

Just the plain and simple implausibility of it. The culture, the contradictions, the fanaticism, the cruelty etc... all this stuff is good ammunition to saying why Islam is BAD.

But why it's wrong. The reason why it's wrong on the most fundamental level has always been that I can't get my head around the idea that God exists.

One day I realised that I never believed in God, like I never believed in Santa but still expected presents on x-mas day.

Many people talk about how they believed fanatically and gave it a lot of hard thought before truly deciding to leave Islam. It seems a lot of people feel resentful that many years were robbed from them because of the way the religion took up so much needless devotion. But how about the people who in their heart, always thought ""aw man, gotta go to prayer again?"" and ""god this is boring, it doesn't even make sense"" while growing up?

This might be something more suited for r/atheism, but I want to hear the opinions of people from my own background I guess. What was it that made you 100% decide, not that Islam was incorrect, but that God simply did not exist?

For me, I sort of feel programmed to not believe in god. Like a blind anti-faith.

I'm livid right now. A lot of you know that my parents took my siblings from the US to Jordan 2 months ago to ""give them a better life"". My dad is a deadbeat who has been unemployed (by choice) since 2010 and has no intention of getting a job. They live off of a weekly allowance his family gives them and they don't pay housing costs there since his parents own the building.

Today, on a drive to a shitty area to visit my late grandfathers widow (read: second wife who now has 4 small children without a father since he married a 25yr old woman at 65 and procreated.....because islam) my brother and father were fighting and my father was driving recklessly. Someone tried to pass them, pissing my dad off and causing him to speed up even more and drive even more recklessly. The car caught up to them and the riders cursed at my dad. My rapist brother cursed back, thinking it's totally cool to curse someone's mother. They pulled a gun on my entire family in the car at a light and told them they were gonna die, and the only reason they didn't kill them right then was because there were young girls in the car. I don't care if this was just a threat. I don't care if there was any chance the gun could have been a fake. My 5 yr old sister witnessed a gun being pointed at her by a psycho with road rage today in a place where he'd likely never get arrested for it. My siblings were horrified, and are still shaken up. My parents see no issue with this. None. Those men could have followed them home. They could have done awful things. For all I fucking know they just might. 

There was no reason to move to Jordan. They had free housing here, they were welfare queens with free food stamps and healthcare. They moved because he suddenly found himself to be a Qur'an thumping psycho after a life of cheating, drinking and felony fraud who believes he'll be forgiven by god for the atrocities he's committed by living in a muslim country. 

They've pulled my siblings out of school. My siblings don't speak Arabic. They're American kids. They now have to go to shitty Arabic schools with no means to teach American kids because my parents can't afford the good private English schools. 

They also can't afford much food. He gets $700 USD a week from his family to support 7 people. That's their entire income. So far they've been there less than 2 months and he's had to spend hundreds of JOD's on my sisters health. She got food poisoning and they wouldn't take her to the hospital until she wouldn't wake up one day. They're literally letting these kids live like shit and it's okay to them. When he had to pay a ton for all the medicines she needed and the days of hospital care and IV's, he flipped a shit on my mom/sister. 

When I asked my mother why they couldn't just come back, life in amman has proven to be awful for them, she says ""I don't want to die in America. I don't want to be buried in kuffar dirt.""

.....My mom is 44, guys. Nowhere near elderly to give a bullshit excuse like this. She's ruining their lives, and this is all the excuse I can get. I'm so angry. So mad. My sister is 5. My brother is 13. Other sisters are 16/19. They're miserable, scared, and my psycho Muslim dad doesn't GAF as long as he's doing what he wants when he wants. He doesn't give them a dime. They have no money, hardly any food and he's happy because my sisters can't sneak out at night in amman. He gets to trap them and live how he wants. 

My siblings (apart from my rapist brother) are all budding exmoose who are living in pure hell right now. My heart breaks for them and I wish I could get them home. I learned today he will come back to the US every year to complete his tax return to get a refund on his ""allowance"" (which is complete fraud....I've reported him multiple times to no avail) while keeping the kids trapped in Jordan.

I need you all to understand that all the hurt, fear or anger your feeling is totally worth the liberation associated with freedom. All the pain your parents put you through, the pain you put your parents through- they amount to nothing. The battle you’re going through with your families or communities aren’t a test of your courage, their tolerance (or lack thereof) or even a debate of who is right or wrong. Everything I experienced was (simply put) a way to test what I was willing to do for what I knew was right for me.

I’m out. I want to scream it from the rooftops. I’m living in an environment which is about fifty steps lower than the luxury I was used to but *I just don’t care*. My house might smell of old ladies (airing it out/glade-ing the frick out of it seems to disguise it temporarily), my shower might only have one pressure setting and my couch is not made of leather, but this is home. I am free to go outside without the hijab without fear of being recognized, free to control my own diet, free to go out and do whatever the hell I like. And do you know what I’ve discovered? Everyday is surprisingly not filled with drinking, premarital sex and an assortment of drug trialing/abortions. Shockingly enough, I barely drink except a glass or two socially (rarely, AND I MADE FRIENDS because of the confidence with not wearing a scarf and not being the ""token scarf friend"") and have also discovered I have an allure of sorts to men when I want to! Go figure.

Back on topic, I’m not only a pleasantly boring nineteen-going-on-fifty adult, but I realize without my hijab I am a strong, confident middle-eastern woman who don’t need no man. Because the hijab’s off, I feel more confident and it doesn’t feel wrong to be happy/feel normal/be included/ be myself. I made a whole bunch of non-religiously associated friends who are nerdy, a little insane and studious just like me so things are super positive at my end, finally. My relationship with my parents has somewhat disintegrated into pleasantries and to be perfectly frank with you, this is perhaps the best outcome for me.

Being able to be yourself is a privilege and has such a degree of satisfaction associated with it that most things you had in your old life fade away. I miss my best friends at home dreadfully, but I’m surprisingly well adjusted. I never knew I could be this happy.

So everyone struggling right now, thinking it’ll never end, I assure you. It comes sooner than you expect and suddenly, the world is bigger and brighter than you could’ve imagined, filled with people you only imagined in your deepest wishes and I promise that EVERYTHING will stop hurting.

I love you all. Thank you all for being here for me when I needed you. I am in your debt and will continue to serve the ex-Muslim community. Speaking of which, I'm getting back to my modding services for the chat now. I recently got internet back at home and my study timetable is brilliant. I'll work around my study hours x lecture times x lab times to fit it all in. So far, I have it under control. Semester 1 begins next week, I've worked through my prelim lectures and the first lecture, made my notes for it and I AM ALL OF THE PREPARED.

Gonna get dem A's! Boo-yah.

Hope everyone here's doing well!

I came out to my best friend. I invited him to my house one day, and just told him. I couldn't bear no one knowing the ""real"" me, not even my best friend. He wasn't very religious. I asked him if he hated me for it, and he said no. 

A relative of his, also a close friend of mine came to know. In a group of close friends, he exclaimed ""So, you're agnostic, right?"" (I was at the time) I stared at him, dumbfounded. Luckily, out of those friends, only two of them knew the meaning of agnostic. One was the best friend, and the other was a liberal fellow who already knew apostates in other cities. 

Note that I did not attempt to deconvert anyone. I simply told those two friends why I left Islam. The best friend is now completely irreligious, on the edge, if you will. His relative came out to his father as an agnostic, his father turned out to be an atheist (living in a liberal society for two  years probably helped). I guess not every household is as conservative as mine, he was never religious to begin with (still surprised at what happened though). I told two other friends of my religious status, both of them Hindu. One of them is of the idea now that religion shouldn't exist (yet he has forced me to offer salat in the past), another one is still amazed at my apostasy. So all in all, 5 people in real life know of my apostasy. 

I probably wasn't the only influence on my friends in their ""turning away"" from their respective religions, but I'm still surprised that coming out to them still had such an effect, even though I did not attempt to deconvert them. I guess reason and logic still get through to some people. 

Edit: I feel like I should emphasize this again. Safety is the first priority. I'm sure most of you are very cautious individuals, but sometimes, you just want to tell someone, to get it off your chest. Do not come out to anyone in real life, unless you are absolutely sure that that person will keep the news of your apostasy to themselves, and won't hate you for it. Had my friend ratted off to the wrong people, I would be in a lot of trouble. Do take care.

I'm finally ready to share my plans with you about my project.

The project in question is in fact a feature-length documentary film about apostates of Islam. It will tell the story of their struggles, triumphs, and their reasons for leaving the religion behind.

I will be the producer, writer and director of the film.

***********************************************************

**Subject Matter**:

In many predominantly Muslim countries, the penalty for apostasy in Islam is no less than death by decapitation. This has been a common subject of heated debate amongst Islamic scholars and progressives, as well as staunch opponents of the religion.

No matter where those debates lead, however, there is still a clear and present danger for any ex-Muslim to openly declare their apostasy to the world. Doing so can quickly result in undue disownment, persecution, and even death.

This is especially a concern in today’s world where true privacy is quickly becoming a thing of the past. A few minutes of internet use can leave a digital trail that can be used against unassuming apostates to track them down. This forces them to take multiple measures of safety to ensure that all their interactions with their fellow ex-Muslims be more anonymous and harder to trace.

These ex-Muslims become especially frustrated when they see their former brethren engaging in acts of barbarism and wallowing in cognitive dissonance, but are afraid to speak their minds. They want to show the world that there are in fact former Muslims who are leaving the Islamic way of life behind not only to gain the respect and acceptance of the international community, but to lead more fulfilling lives as well.

**Purpose:**

The documentary will primarily consist of interviews with fellow apostates, with the ultimate aim of showing the world that we are an exponentially growing community, and that we will one day have a unified voice that will make it easier for us to come out of the closet and live openly and freely, with no fear of death threats being leveled at us simply because we don't believe in certain unsubstantiated claims.

These interviews will also go over how these apostates see Islam today, using their opinions as platforms towards discussing the current state of Islam in the world, as well as where it’s headed in the foreseeable future.

**Intended Audience**:

The audience will be anyone who has a vested interest in Islamic affairs, or has genuine concerns about the effects that Islam has on its people and the world at large.

**Approach:**

I will personally travel to where these apostates call their home, be it their country of origin or otherwise, and shoot the interview as well as footage of the locale to serve as a complementary story-telling tool.

Most of you already know that as an apostate myself, I am putting myself in direct danger by traveling to countries where I can have my head on a chopping block if my cover was blown. This will add a very real sense of urgency to conduct all of these interviews safely, and to return to more civilized shores in one piece.

**Why are you doing this?**

This is an issue that hits very close to home for all of us. To put it simply: I am monumentally frustrated that people like us have to deal with circumstances that we have no choice but to deal with on a daily basis.

If we want our situation to improve, and want steps taken towards abolishing all fears of coming out as apostates of Islam, then we have to take those steps ourselves.

This film is by no means a solution to the problem, but it will raise enough awareness to take things in the right direction.

**When will you start shooting?**

The film will take the entirety of 2013 to pull off, with the ultimate goal of releasing the movie in the 1st quarter of 2014. The finished product will also be submitted to the 2014 Cannes Film Festival.

**Is there anything I can do to help?**

I will be launching an IndieGoGo campaign this upcoming **Wednesday, October 17th at 6:00 AM, US Pacific Time.**

The funds will go towards 1/4th of the total production and distribution costs, shooting equipment, man-power, as well as travel expenses.

Even if I don't raise as much as a nickel, the project will still go forward. However, without the funds, the project will take much longer, with a projected release date of 2015.

If you would like to spread the word about the film, feel free to use the following page:

http://www.facebook.com/guiltismygod

The page is still in its infancy, and many updates will follow. I've included a fairly succinct overview of the documentary's purpose and approach in the ""about"" page, with more to come.

I will post the IndieGoGo page on /r/atheism, then x-post it here.

***********************************************************

Before I end this post, I must express my sincerest gratitude to both agentvoid and Improvaganza for their time and input with this project. They will both remain points of reference well throughout the creation of this film. I owe them both a night out filled with *very haram*, Allah-defying activities.

Remember:

This movie is about *you*, *for you*, and will be created by one of *you*. Any input you may have will be seriously taken into account. If you feel that there should be something covered in the movie that I'm missing, then I will personally see to it that it will be addressed.

I will always come back here to update everyone, and will remain an active contributor to this subreddit to the best of my ability.

I'm sure you have far more questions and concerns than what I've covered here, so please post them here if you have any.

Thank you all for inspiring me.

**UPDATE:**

Due to issues regarding the IndieGoGo page that are out of my control, the launch will be **Wednesday, October 17th.**

I will post the link for the page here when it's launched, amongst other places.",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,1350438187.0,,,True,t3_11bf4c,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/11bf4c/guilt_is_my_god_why_we_left_islam_a_documentary/,

**""""The incident relating to King Chakrawati Farmas is documented in an old manuscript in the India Office Library, London, which has reference number: Arabic, 2807, 152-173. It is quoted in the book “Muhammad Rasulullah,” by M. Hamidullah:**

&gt;   *“There is a very old tradition in Malabar, South-West Coast of India, that Chakrawati Farmas, one of their kings, had observed the splitting of the moon, the celebrated miracle of the Holy Prophet (pbuh) at Mecca, and learning on inquiry that there was a prediction of the coming of a Messenger of God from Arabia, he appointed his son as regent and set out to meet him. He embraced Islam at the hand of the Prophet, and when returning home, at the direction of the Prophet, died at the port of Zafar, Yemen, where the tomb of the “Indian king” was piously visited for many centuries.”*

**The old manuscript in the 'India Office Library' contains several other details about King Chakrawati Farmas and his travel.""""**

Librarian 1: Your enquiry is being passed to our Asia and Africa Reference Service for reply, as the India Office Library is part of their collections.

Librarian 2: Thank you for your message.

We do indeed hold in our collection a composite manuscript (our ref. I.O. Islamic 2807) which contains such an account on folios 81 - 104 verso. It bears no date nor indication of authorship, but is entitled 'Qissat Shakruti Firmad' and is described thus in one of our publsihed catalogues:

'A fabulous account of the first settlement of the Muhammadans in Malabar, under King Shakruti (Cranganore), a contemporary of Muhammad, who was converted to Islam by the miracle of the division of the moon.'

I hope this is helpful.

**Patron: Thank you very much for your help. Is it possible to know for sure that the account is actually of a real historical event or simply a folk legend?**


Librarian 2: Thank you once again for your message.

Given the length of time which has elapsed I doubt very much that this can be verified as such, but the use of the word 'fabulous' in the description in the published catalogue does indicate that it is rooted in legend rather than established fact.

It may have been connected to a lunar eclipse.

For my sister who has had her voice taken away. For my sister who has been to hell and back, and isn't even 25. I read a post on here yesterday that made my blood boil. It was about a man who faked being a muslim married a girl, had a epiphany later on in life, and left her. This hit so close to home I made a account just for this. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD YOU GET MARRIED UNLESS YOU ARE ABLE TO COMMIT 100%. Fuck pressure from your parents, fuck social norms, fuck you being lonely. When you get married its no longer about you, you are bringing in an innocent third party, your destroy them you ruin them and then you walk away like nothing. 

   My dad was a abusive asshole, he abused me and my sister but my mom got it the worst. My mom had to have a hysterectomy after my sister was born or basically she would have died. My dad started beating her the day she came back from the hospital I was five. I had to basically raise my sister growing up my dad didn't give a shit about her since she was a girl and my mom was so emotionally fucked up she believed she deserved everything she got. I gave up on religion at a young age but my sister didn't maybe she it gave her some kind of comfort. 

   When she was 18 by dad married her off to a doctors son. I protested but short of killing my dad, which crossed my mind, there was nothing I could do. The kid she married was a spoiled 24yr bum he would stay at home all day and play video games, while treating my sister like a salve he used religion as a jail to keep my sister in. She got pregnant had a kid and he was still living off of daddy's money. I finally confronted him one night and he basically laughed it off saying he's a atheist and this is just the perks of being surrounded by idiots. I blacked the fuck out next thing I remember he's laying on the ground bloody out cold. I took my sister and left.

  It took so much persuasion to get her to file for a divorce. Even more to get her to claim child and spousal support. The things said about my family would cruel and mean. My dad is out of our lives my mom refused to leave. Now my sister and my niece live with me it's been almost 4 years and she's still not 100%. She refuses to date and is still a practicing muslim. I love her and will never leave her but basically at 24 her life is over. ",(Rant),False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,rant,,True,t3_1kaniv,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1kaniv/for_my_sister/,

I'm so glad I found this subreddit, very cool to hear from other former Muslims.

I remember when I left Islam clearly, it was Thanksgiving ~5 years ago. I has just moved to a new state and started a new job. A former U.S. Marine who I worked with (and happened to be married to an Israeli), invited me to his house for thanksgiving dinner, knowing I had nowhere to go and knew very few people.

When I lived with my family, we didn't celebrate any holidays except shia muslim holidays (which are all depressing as hell, with the exception of eid) .

So there I was at dinner, with a bunch of guys/gals from work (a lot of whom were new just like me) all having dinner together. We were of all faiths, and it was an absolutely great time. I really enjoyed myself.

I suddenly realized how great all these people were around me, and how absurd the idea of all-them going to hell was. It was weird, I always viewed the world as muslim and non-muslim, but here religion didn't matter. I could tell all these people were good, and my religion was clearly wrong.

When the turkey (non-halal) came around to me, I didn't decline it. I took it on my plate. I had never eaten any meat that wasn't halal before... I wasn't sure if I could eat it. In college, I was pretty much a vegetarian as there was no halal place near by; I’d eat mean if I went home on a break but that was it. 

At that dinner, I took the most nervous bite of food I had ever taken. And it was delicious, hellfire didn't rain down, I didn't die, no, I just kept having a good time with people who are still close friends, and I wasn't muslim anymore. 

Many more events unfolded after this, like telling my family I wasn’t muslim, drinking alcohol for the first time, or finally interacting and pursuing women for the first time-- each that has an interesting story in it’s own right, but that night was a turning point. Since then, I have rarely felt guilty for pointless things. I've been much more assertive in my life, and heading in direction I really like. It opened the doors to all kinds of new experiences in food, drink, love, and life.  

I'd love to hear your experiences.

But now, being godless and exmuslim, I am much happier.",AllahCoholic,54,7,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1hiq96/looking_back_in_my_youth_islam_gave_me_a_very/,"This is entirely a spur-of-the-moment post that I wanted to share after this lazy day for me of watching tv and movies.

I loved the Power Rangers, and I loved the Matrix. I adored superheroes, I dreamt about fast cars, I tingled with the virginal glow of smiles together with goosebumps when the good guys in movies used the big awesome guns and the fancy gadget-shit to fight the bad guys. Pew pew pew! *booom!* And I loved magicians and illusionists who could pull off some of the most amazing tricks, where the crowds would get up of their chairs and cheer and whoop with joy.

And so, I would relish the opportunity to sit down and hear my mosque teachers talk about heaven. This amazing garden, where you could have anything you want. You closed your eyes, imagined it, and opened your eyes to find it was there. You'd never be bored, everyone would be happy, everything would be so so perfect, I mean, you wouldn't even need to poop!

So we kids would stare at each other with smiles, wide-eyed, and then when mosque would finish, we'd chatter away at all the awesome things that we'd have in our mansions in heaven, we'd bicker on for hours and have updates each day about new things we're going to add to our palace. When I would watch TV, I'd actually be making a mental list of all the cool things that I'd be able to do in heaven, for real. Without the CGI. Doing the impossible. Racing a car at 250 mph, pushing a super secret button and having it turn into a submarine before the wings and rocket boosters come out and jetting off into space for interplanetary travel, whilst not forgetting to take a few parachutes.

It was such a drug, and such bliss. I would jump out of bed in the morning to pray Fajr, I'd read all my Nafl prayers and then some extra, and I'd read quran actively, rocking back and forth, thinking about all the extra brownie points I'll be earning with Allah. ""One letter = 10 sawaab!"", my mosque teachers would say.

My life has had its ups and downs and now here I sit writing this out. I am 20 years old. Thinking about my childhood makes me feel funny and want to laugh, but there's a recurring element of sadness to it which stops me from doing so. It's almost a childhood wasted, but the person sitting here has been shaped through all the experiences he's been through - I really can't think how I would have turned out if I had a non-religious upbringing because... well, because. I only know me. And it's a waste of time to think about if the past was different.

Okay, I'm not going to ramble on anymore. Sorry if I have. Now I know what's real in life. And this lovely subreddit which teaches me a something verifiable and true almost every day is also chock-full of all our stories, all the questions raised to make you think about the claims of Mo, and whether the time has come to stop throwing flower necklaces and start critically looking at the history of Islam and weighing up the moral arguments which attempt to justify that creepy and bipolar god in the quran.

It hurts to see my parents, my entire family, wasting their lives on such a false and pointless vision. I try and add hints and comments to get them to think twice, all to no avail. A few eyebrows raised occasionally, but for the wrong reasons - I would find them were becoming hysterical, thinking I was blaspheming. You have to persist, yes, but give the baby it's candy or whatever it wants to hear because... well, the situation just bloody well calls for it!

Arg. Okay, I'm kinda losing my train of thought. Carl Sagan had an amazing quote, which explains it better, let me find it...

&gt; “The significance of our lives and our fragile planet is then determined only by our own wisdom and courage. We are the custodians of life's meaning. We long for a Parent to care for us, to forgive us our errors, to save us from our childish mistakes. But knowledge is preferable to ignorance. Better by far to embrace the hard truth than a reassuring fable. If we crave some cosmic purpose, then let us find ourselves a worthy goal.” 

 (from Pale Blue Dot - a truly moving book about humanity and space, which puts a book like the quran to shame)

Yes! Exmoose, there is no test of loyalty, there is no meaning to life. So get out there and create your own meaning of life! If you're stuck at home nearly all the time like me, remember that you have a palace in your mind which you can fill with anything you want - philosophy, the critique of islam, science - anything whatsoever. And noone can take that away from you - noone. And there's no creepy sky daddy who's going to get upset over its content! ;)

I just need to feel you all here so I can stop feeling so guilty, so I can feel supported or loved or cared about. I need someone to tell me their proud of me, I need supportive parent-like-people who give me unconditional love. I need you all to just say that you understand maybe tell me that I'm not alone or tell me something different because everything hurts and I have no where to turn to that doesn't make me hate everything about myself, all I can see is my mum crying and my dad saying the most hurtful words and I just want to take it all back. I've never wanted to go back to being a Muslim so much as I do now so I don't have to hurt them or myself anymore.

I've been getting really relaxed with my parents since I'm moving soon. Really, really relaxed and I genuinely couldn't contain myself and couldn't stop. To the point where I totally flipped my shit today when I heard them, my parents saying bigoted/close minded things.

Today I received a strange political email from baba asking me to check his grammar and spelling as English isn't his first language. I sent him back an email explaining his choice of words made it near impossible for me to understand and that I needed him to explain it better when I got home. Turns out my dad is part of a group of Shia Muslims who are trying to form a political party for Shia Muslims in this country. I stared at him, dumbfounded and felt the rise of sharia in this beautiful country. I didn't want it, and I didn't want to support it. I told him flat out that it was wrong of him to impose his morality into a Western country and that if he wanted sharia he ought to move to Iran. He talked about having a voice in parliament and I felt furious. Religion and politics should never mix. I wanted to defend this beautiful country from oppressive ways of living. First big mistake.

The reason why they're forming this political party is because the Muslim member of parliament betrayed them by supporting legalization of prostitution (see: inaction), and not acting against gay marriage.

I feel very strongly pro-gay marriage. I've researched it thoroughly and in honesty it is one of the main reasons for my apostasy. So I defended gay marriage. Second big mistake. My mum was in the same room. She says to me ""Avocadoeh, who are those people who are putting such filthy ideas in your head?"". She couldn't understand anything I said when I talked about the psychology paper I took and the focus on homosexuality found that it wasn't a choice- that there are natural and nurturing causes- and that I was supportive of everyone having equal rights. I tried explaining that we had a lot of similar moral values and that we may differ on some, and that it was alright- that we were adults and we could come to different conclusions, but as long as we didn't conflict with other peoples rights we'd be able to coexist.

She (note: she is a registered doctor) said: ""Don't you understand that homosexuality is wrong? Don't you see? Where did AIDS come from? Them. All the diseases, like even specific cancers are just for gay people. God doesn't throw stones for no reason. It's haram. It's not just about being haram. These gay people, they are children who's parents throw them on the streets. They don't have anywhere to turn to and they even start sleeping with animals. You just want to hurt me. Don't you know x who's mother died, and then she became religious? What about y and z, their mother died and now their religious? Do I have to die? Do you want me to die? Oh, please, Lord, I wish to die tomorrow. How could you do this to me? You make me a failed parent.""- she proceeded to scream at God to kill her tomorrow.

My father who has always seemed accepting, showed his true colours. I've told him about you guys. The /r/exmuslim forum, the fact that I wasn't alone and that this place gives me comfort. That was the third mistake I made. He said to her that there were people online called exmuslim who poisoned me, who rallied for gay marriage and legalisation of prostitution. I laughed, stupidly because I thought it was hilarious how wrong he was. My father then said ""This is enough. We would not have raised you as we did to make you turn out like filth. All the years of hard work we put in to you- in the greying of my beard, sending you to a private school and letting you learn to use all your intelligence and energy and passion in doing the exact things that are wrong and against us. You are a disgrace.""

My mother rounded up that conversation with saying ""All the other families, they look at you and say that you are the best. You were supposed to be the best child. You were so quiet and polite and intelligent. You were kind and generous. You were like our pearl.""

Mama ran away from me, crying, baba stayed in the kitchen and I came right here because I don't know how to make me better and everything hurts and I don't know what to do.

It hurts to think that they don't see me as the same person. I am exactly the same person as I was, but they see me as filth. And it just hurts to know that they're spreading bigoted and close minded ideas- that they're the exact people I'm trying to fight against in this world. It hurts to know that we'll fundamentally disagree. And it hurts because I don't want to think of myself as not kind, because I am kind. I am still polite. I am still intelligent. I am still a good child. I want to believe it all because I look backwards in my development and the only things that have changed about me is I'm more confident, I'm less depressed and I am in so many ways a much stronger person now post-Islam than I could ever have been while still a Muslim. As a Muslim I had more suicidal behaviours than I ever did as an ex-. I've become a much better person. At least I think so. Did I?

Humans- we victimise ourselves. And I can't help but wondering if I'm not the victim here. That I'm wrong. That I did poison myself, and royally fucked myself up and my parents, my poor parents are the ones who are victims. They've raised a piece of shit daughter who doesn't do what she's told. She's corrupted, tainted. No wonder they say apostates deserve death, cause if they're the victim then I should be killed. I can't unfuck myself up. Diseases- should be controlled and destroyed. What if I'm the disease?

And I'm just so angry. At God for not existing or if he does exist for NOT FUCKING PROVING IT WHEN I BEGGED AND PRAYED FOR SO GOD DAMN LONG. I'm so fucking mad at myself for not controlling todays conversation. There's so many things I wish for right now and I wish today never happened. I wish God existed because it'd take a miracle to get everything back to the way they were between us. I can't.

I'm still moving. My flight's set on for the 12th of February. They can't stop me from leaving nor can they control me once I get there. But they're my *parents*. Doesn't that mean anything? Doesn't it?

I just don't know what to do from now until then. Does anyone know what I can do aside from stick to day-by-day activities and keep my head down? I have no idea. I have nothing. No one else understands. Please. I need you.

I have to deal with two going away dinners (one strictly Arab, one for people I actually like) from now until then and several friends want to say individual good byes to me. I don't know what to do. I just want to disappear. I just need to disappear right now because it's never going to change. I can't escape, no matter how far I go.

**TL;DR** : I fucked up. I need hugs.

**Edit** : I'm overwhelmed by the support on here. It's exactly what I needed. I'm going to try and keep out of the house as much as I possibly can from this point onwards, try and be as cordial as I can be to my parents whenever I do see them.

We do not share your faith anymore and yet most of us feel close to you. We disagree with Muhammad's teachings and yet most of us don't hold a grudge for him. We reject _some_ ethical requirements and scientific claims in Islam and yet most of us haven't turned into Satan's worshipers.

It is true that sometimes we vent our frustration in this subreddit or elsewhere because we are humans just as you are. Many have rejected the idea of Allah's existence, for lack of evidence or because Allah's description is not consistent with his deed ; and yet we don't hate Allah, for we cannot hate what we question the existence of.

In truth, most of us don't hate Muslims and are no enemies to Islam, most of us actually still cling to the most noble morals of Islam, because there is some good in it. But Islam is an abstract concept, an all-or-nothing system of belief, so are all world's religions. Reason rejects dogmas, scientific inaccuracy and unacceptable statements. So those of us who were reasonable enough couldn't help rejecting the wrong in Islam, and felt compelled to reject faith as a whole, that very faith they loved so much, because doublethink only exists in sci-fi novels. However thought-crime does exist in real life in the land of Islam.

Most of you accept that other nations have different religions, but few accept that those who were born Muslims think for themselves. The fact is irreligion has no place in Muslim countries. Atheists, agnostics, freethinkers are ostracized, jailed, silenced and sometimes put to death. If Quraysh did not loosen their policy toward early Muslims, there would not be Islam at all ; and yet early Muslims have gradually turned from oppressed to oppressors. Muslims don't accept that other religions or even secular thinkers spread the word in their land, whereas in the West they overtly invite others to embrace Islam, precisely because the West is a land of freedom. This sounds like a double standards : fine abroad, not so fine at home.

What I am asking you is not to embrace irreligion, for it is fine to have a religion and Islam is no much worse than any other religion as long as one doesn't advocate violence and intolerance. What I am asking and even begging you is to think twice before condemning, in a way or in another, those among you who have chosen a different way. In other words, I am asking you the right to exist for freethinkers, the right to enjoy living in our own countries with our people - Muslim people we love and among which are our parents, siblings, friends and neighbors - without being persecuted or fearing for our lives.

Of course, people might ask about our beliefs and we might tell them we don't have one and why we don't. This is no different from Muslims in a foreign land asked about their faith and answering why they believe, it is freedom for all. We might challenge your faith, but if your faith is truth and can stand rational arguments, then you don't have anything to fear for. If not, then you might judge for yourself who is right and who is wrong and grant yourself an additional opportunity to strengthen your faith (or reject it if you deem fit) and maybe bring back to the right path those who were led astray, in which case you would be rewarded.

I think it is a fair deal, what do you think ?

Yours sincerely,

A freethinker",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,,,True,t3_mxosa,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/mxosa/a_letter_to_muslims/,

These are some of the criticisms that have been leveled at this subreddit over the years. They are from memory. Some of them sound like hyperbole but were expressed with the utmost sincerity. These aren't in any particular order. Please elaborate (if you agree with any point) or add a criticism to the list. Thank you.

* This subreddit is islamophobic.

* There's a lot of misogyny here. Some of the members are inappropriate and creepy with their comments.

* The exmuslims here were never really Muslims or don't know Islam well enough.

* Most of us left the religion due to bad experiences with Muslims.

* We are rude and snarky.

* A lot of us quit Islam because of the strict rules. We left so we could eat pork, drink alcohol and have sex.

* We hate progressive and liberal Muslims. We support those Muslims who think we should be killed for our apostasy than those who would speak against it.

* We've disabled downvotes because we can't handle criticism or dissent.

* The mod(s) are oppressive. They'll tell you to shut the fuck up and will silence any dissent.

* The mods are too easy going with trolls and the like.

* r/exmuslim conducts downvote brigades.

* There are too many memes and shitty posts here.

* This sub shouldn't be just about recovery.

* This sub isn't focused enough on recovery.

* This sub doesn't do anything for the truly oppressed exmuslim in third world countries.

* zulaikha_idris

* This subreddit is filled with people too obsessed with Islam and Muslims to ever move forward.

* Get over r/islam already.

* This subreddit is anti-Arab.

* We are Zionist shills.

* This subreddit can be a depressing place and can trigger bad memories and emotions.

* We support right wingers and bigots.

* There isn't enough intelligent posts or original content.

* There isn't enough user activity. Too many lurkers.

* We are against atheists.

1360977866.0,47,self.exmuslim,18m4l0,Have Dutch-Muslim family visiting me here. They are somehow very conservative. Here's some of the bullshit I had to live through this week...,,58,11,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/18m4l0/have_dutchmuslim_family_visiting_me_here_they_are/,"Quick demographics: 
Relation to me is that they're my aunt's/mom's cousins and aunt/uncle.
The cousins are men and are married, one is married to a Dutch-Pakistani, the other to a Vietnamese-American convert to Islam. Amazingly enough, the convert is the most tolerable. The aunt/uncle (I call them my grandparents) are elderly, the uncle is from Suriname and the Aunt is Pakistani.

I realized that was complicated. All you need to know is that the there are two women who married into the family, including a convert.


**""I won't eat halaal KFC because KFC is owned by kaafirs and you cannot trust kaafirs.""**

The Surinamese uncle refused to go eat at the Zabeeha Halal KFC because he kept arguing that KFC is owned by Kaafirs and you cannot trust them. He kept going on and on about how every man will answer for himself on Qiyaama. Even as a vegetarian, the part about ""no trust"" pissed me the fuck off.

**""Her job is to learn how to take care of her husband and daughter.""**

The Viet-American moved to the Netherlands then converted. So she's only learning Dutch, also learning Arabic, and lives with people who speak Urdu. She gets flustered because the aunt only speaks to her in Urdu (even though she doesn't understand...) and then when the girl fucks up, they blame her.

My own aunt forced her to make a Pakistani dish, while her god damn baby was wrapped around her body, so that she can properly learn to feed her husband and daughter.

They also argued that there's no need for her to learn Dutch (even though she fucking lives in a Dutch-speaking country) because Urdu is her daughter's language.... I didn't realize mother-tongue was actually father-tongue (her husband is the one that knows urdu)....

**""It's better to learn to cook what your husband likes, that's what a good wife is.""**

Both of the girls that married into the family are not good with desi food. This ends up a source of ridicule and anger, as the aunt/grandma  constantly tells them ""look how good so-and-so cooks food, learn from her."" It was even more degrading when the aunt told the girls to learn from *me.* If I was a mother/wife/adult and someone told me to learn something from a teenager, I'd be pissed as hell.

**""Menopause is a bad word.""**

One of the male cousins flipped shit when the other one said the word ""menopause."" I asked why he was making such a god damn deal over it because it's a natural human process. He said, ""Many things are natural human processes. Doesn't mean you should say them.""

Body shame and degradation of women will make me hate you like no other. Islamic cultures have serious period shame epidemics, and now this bullshit? 

I should point out, he said ""shit"" three times while freaking out about the word ""menopause."" I called him out on it. He said menopause ""is much much worse.""

**""The Netherlands is so bad for Muslims. We wanna come to America.""**

Siting nudity and the ban on halal chicken as forms of persecution, these culturally inept people believe that the United States is more Muslim-friendly.

**""Horse meat is haraam because horses are smart.""**

Of course I'm gonna go veg-shit on you guys, but this dumb bitch claimed that horses (which are veg animals... and all veg animals, except pigs, are halal. But she claimed it was a Bukhari hadith) are so smart, that's why you cannot have horse meat except in dire conditions. 

How convenient it is to believe doctrine over science. Forgetting that pigs are smarter than human toddlers, and cows have complex mental systems, and fishes are known for their social psychology.

**""We're not playing with the dog. Kill it.""**

Our neighbors are abusive and neglectful of their dog. The dog broke through the fence and of course freaked these little Muslims out. After I lead her back, I saw the inside of the fence and realized she was being horridly neglected. There were feces everywhere, she was boney and thin, the lawn was an untamed mess, the toys were raggedy and all over. I called animal control and reported the issue. Went inside to get water for the poor dog.. was told ""we don't wanna make that dog think she's allowed here. Kill her."" 
Of course they forget the story of the poor man who fed water to a dog and God rewarded him or some shit like that.

**""Put on another shirt. You're a girl.""**

As some of you may remember, my family is very particular about how I dress, seeing I'm the only female among 57 cousins who has curves, I am consistently degraded to skin and cleavage. This time, however, in front of these adult guests, my aunt decided it not only acceptable to tell the women how big of a burden my chest is (infer whatever details you want, cause she said it all) but also, when I told her she had no reason to tell these people my personal life, she says ""You're a girl. That's why they say you shouldn't talk so much okay? You haven't gotten into the practical world yet. So just talk less.""



This a rant above all else guys. I don't have anyone who understands how fucking ridiculously suffocating these people, and their life-destroying beliefs are.

Turned around and saw every other religion for what it was, and I haven’t looked back since.  
I’ve been lurking since Ramadan days, and this reddit has been my guilty pleasure for its godless take on the islamic.

Quick back story: Raised catholic light, had to go to church every Sunday and CCD, but no one ever manages to instill any of that catholic guilt in me and I certainly never took the bible literally.  I’ve since asked my parents why they wasted so many Sunday mornings dragging us to church, and they said “to give us something” and I suspect a strong dose of guilt from their parents.  Went to Uni, church days were a distance memory.  Got set up on blind date with wonderful muslim foreign born man.  Fell in love.  Got married.
  
Of course it was more complicated than that.  Though he is clearly super moderate,  his whole family is an entangled, hypocritical mix of culture and religion, that still have a few vines firmly implanted in him.

   We played the catholic card when meeting his family and they still put up a hullabaloo, so far as getting local imam to try and tell him that a muslim man couldn’t marry christian girl.  Luckily, I was taught how to use books as sources and quickly put the kibosh on that one.   The fun didn’t stop there but we persisted, and they finally decided that the quicker we got married the quicker we would get divorced and he could find his local, muslim wife.  (yup, his dad actually said that)  So we had a nice big wedding in each country, and to their credit, his family, other than normal annoying in-law stuff, have been pretty good.  

So the kids you ask?  
Early in the relationship, when I had a more positive view of islam, we agreed he could raise the kids as muslims.  I figure I will focus on critical thinking and a broad worldview, secretly hoping that islam will function as an inoculants does, stamping out more virulent future strains of irrationalism.  And if it doesn’t, oh well, they’re my kids. 
 My husband has never read the Koran.  He’s a nice person, and he is woefully ignorant of islam.  He follows the few cherry picked things his family did growing up, most of which are unobjectionable, a lot which are just silly, and a couple which I find disgusting.   
So my question for redditors:  How hard should I poke the Dragon?  I’m not asking if I should encourage him to become a disbeliever, but rather if I should let him remain in his happy little, mostly unobjectionable strain of islam or if I should educate him what islam actually is.  i.e.  he tried to tell me that slavery wasn’t permitted, that having sex with slaves was haram, etc, until I showed him exactly what it said in the Koran.  He quickly wouldn’t even let me use sahih hadiths.   He is suffering from severe cognitive dissonance, and admits he just doesn’t understand why those things are allowed, and he is sure someone has the reason.  It’s clear the strength of his convictions lie in his connections to his family and culture.  He feels a lot of guilt for moving away from his family.  He has admitted that he would still be a muslim if it was proven that allah wasn’t real, which I think says a lot. I see positive and negatives on both sides, and thought this was a good place to explore these ideas, so thanks!

1340636282.0,46,self.exmuslim,vko4e,About that call to action in r/atheism.  I have an idea of how you can help us help you.,jenniferwillow,56,10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/vko4e/about_that_call_to_action_in_ratheism_i_have_an/,"Part of the reason we westerners do not attack Islam is that is is so foreign to us. This is one of Islam's strengths, that it has become so powerful, prevalent, and influential, and still somehow remained so insular, foreign, and mysterious. One of our poster's recently posted an Islamic word ""Insha'Allah,"" and I, despite having heard it before, had to look it up, again. The words in Arabic all sound so similar to western ears. Arabic has such a different base of linguistics, such a different cadence, and is so rarely used that I suspect the majority of us are going to have a hard time knowing what we are looking at. That puts us at a severe disadvantage when going on the offensive.

r/atheism is known for it's love of graphics. Stuff that is short, quick, easily digested and understood. That's our own little language here in this subreddit. So what I'm suggesting is that you start creating pictures, illustrating words. Think about it, we do this all the time in children's books when they are growing up and learning to speak English.  For example, a picture of a girl jumping rope, and the text ""Jane is jumping rope.  Jump, Jane, Jump!"" So for example, create a picture with the word Jihad on it, the English translation of that word, and place those against an image illustrating Jihad. Another example, create a picture of the word or phrase for righteous retribution (I'm assuming there is one and is likely commonly used), include it's translation, place it over an illustration.  I think you get the picture.

When you do that, post it over to r/atheism. Place a comment in the tread that you are submitting that pic as a way to help educate us about Islam. Then crosspost that pic over here and ask the members of /r/exmuslim to go to the link in /r/atheism and to upvote it. Normally such things are discouraged, but there's a lot of posts there, and stuff like this will need a hand up to get above the rabble.  I think we can make an exception for asking for upvotes in this case for a partnership of this caliber.

That being said, I'm going to copy this post over to /r/atheism as well. I want this idea to get seen and discussed. So I'm going to break intergalactic law and ask that you please upvote this post here in /r/exmuslim, and over in r/atheism. The link over in /r/athism is : http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/vko7g/just_posted_this_idea_over_to_rexmuslim_so_that/

She's lived in england since she was 5 years old so she is pretty modern and knows about the western world. When it comes to trends and my social life, she's pretty lenient with me and so I thought maybe when I get to the time in telling her I've lost faith in Islam, she would be quite respectful about it and still accept me.

However, I had to test her to see the way her mind works in this type of situation and so just a few minutes ago, as we were sitting at the breakfast table, stuffing our faces before sehri ends, I asked her what she would do If her son told her he was gay. This was simply to see how strong her views are on the topic and how faithful she is to god.
so here's how it went...

Me: 'mom, me and my friends always discuss this and wonder what we'd do... and I wanted know what you would do if your son came up to you and openly said he was gay'

My Mom: 'I'd chuck him out.'

Me: 'really? why?'

My Mom: 'It's islamically wrong! I would be disobeying allah if I didn't chuck him out. I would not tolerate that kind of disgusting behaviour from my son.'

Me: 'so you'd disown your only son? after years of caring for him, having given actual birth to him! you'd just let him go?'

My Mum: 'yes! I can't accept my son being gay. Never. No other muslim family would tolerate it!'

Me: 'that is shocking, mum. that's just narrow-minded. If it ever came to the real situation, I'm sure you'd handle it differently to what your saying. You wouldn't just be able to leave him, he's your son!'

My Mum: 'no, no, you're wrong.'

Me: I'm disappointed, mum.

then I just left her.

Anyway, I think that shows something about her and that I really have to prepare myself when it comes to the time that I tell her I'm an atheist.

Did all my prayers, fasted on ramadan, never touched alcohol or pork. Never smoked. Went to mosque. Rinse, dry, repeat. Even thou we moved to the states more than 13 years ago, to this very day, my parents continue to hold tightly to their conservative upbringing. What makes matters worse, my parents follow a branch of Islam that constitutes an incredibly small and depressing community filled with bigots, hypocrites, asshole's who think their entire purpose in life is to ""guide"" those lost unfortunate souls in the right direction, and lots of other generally distasteful people. During college I discovered a whole new world of opportunities, entertainments and excitements which gave my life a whole new meaning. Life was good, and I was happy to get out of the black whole of a community sucking the everlasting happiness and sanity out of my mind. After college, having been away from my household for so long, I decided to live at home for a year to save up money and to reconnect with I considered to be my loving and accepting family. Having been back for only 2 months, I have only been reminded about why I fucking hated living there in the first place. I consider myself an agnostic, yet my parents never fail to remind me that I am most certainly going to suffer the wrath and fury of the all loving and peacefull allah for not following a 1,500 year old book to the letter. They continue to downplay the rich heritage of our own country (Iran) in favor of the extreme arab culture rooted within Islam. Every time I see a woman wearing a hijab, I see an ignorant woman who probably cannot think for herself. Every time, I hear arabic, all I can think is how grotesquely backwards almost all predominantly muslim countries are. Every time I hear the words ramadan, all I can see are the stupid arabs in the middle east threatening to murder a cartoonist just because they cant take a fucking joke. Reddit, you made me realize a whole new world. I did not leave islam because of reddit, but by god, I love the community here.

He asked for my reasons and points, and I put my case forward, and he looked at me with shock. He claimed I look worse off without religion, and that things that happened in my life were just a test. Things from the hadith he just brushed aside as he didn't know the smaller details of Islam. He then jokingly (I hope) said he'd bring me out to my friends and family, if I didn't try praying again for week. I could tell his opinion of me went down the shitter, but meh. 

It was worse that he made me out to be a sort of nutter, and that I genuinely needed help, as all Muslims have doubts. My nafs and shaytaan was too strong. We said our goodbyes, and I said I don't judge you, so don't think less of me. Then he claimed I was probably a lost cause as I'd had a proper thought about it and therefore it was too late for me.

No hijab, being able to cook, eat, hang out and study as I pleased. I, of course, didn't go crazy wild like I always used to think I would go as a Muslim if I ever left Islam. I've been within moderation, through and through.

In summation, I've been an overall happier, healthier, better achieving individual. Because of this, when my mother asked me to come back to live with them for the duration of my intersemester break, I accepted, thinking it would be refreshing to go back.

This is not the case.

To everyone who is considering going back, don't go back.

Don't do it. If you're anything like me, don't do it. If you have parents like mine, don't do it. Parents who expect the perfect Muslimah to come back to them, staying at home or else have a ridiculous curfew of 4pm, cleaning for them and going to mosques.

Don't think you can spare the heart ache, don't think that you miss your *parents*, *friends*, *old life* too much. Because you do, but it's better when it's a long distance sort of relationship. It's healthier this way when you don't have to see your family, be underneath the same rules, restrictions, feelings and obligations. Like going to the mosque and having to pretend to be a Muslim all over again. It deeply traumatises you, inside and outside all over again.

I've been back for only a few days and I detest it. My body, my mind, my mentality. Every ounce of progress I've made has literally evaporated right in front of my eyes. I can see myself becoming the submissive, uncertain, unconfident and introverted person I was forced to be under those obligations as an Ideal Muslimah. This person is not who I am.

I'm thankful I get to leave earlier as I managed to catch a really early flight back home through using the excuse of re enrolment. I'll be home shortly.

This is the last time I will ever visit my parents, family or friends here. And it's a sacrifice I'm going to have to make- not seeing my little brother grow up and not seeing some of the most amazing people I've ever met- because otherwise I become a unhealthy version of myself and everything becomes deeply unpleasant.

So how to survive this sort of experience of re submerging yourself back in closet? I have no idea.

I was in Seoul for the weekend, back when I lived on Jeju Island in Korea.

I'm wandering around the foreigner district. Suddenly, in front of me pops a large, rather beautiful, white mosque.

I wander up, it's completely deserted. I walk in, start looking around, examining the beautiful inlaying on all the surfaces and flipping through a Quran.

In walk a rather quick talking bearded Pakistani fellow in a white kurta. I start talking with him.

Being an evangelizer, he keeps steering the conversation towards Islam. OK, fine. He says that afternoon prayers start soon, he would be very honored if I join. I'm always curious about different cultures, and open, so I say OK.

Soon, about 40 or 50 men stream in - all with beards and wearing kurtas. We do the whole thing - kneel, say some stuff in Arabic, stand up, say some more stuff in Arabic, etc.

Finally, it's coming to a close. The first Pakistani goes in front of the group, and says - ""I am very honored to introduce a new member to our group today. Sasha, repeat this after me. ""لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله!!!"" 

Me..""Uh..what? Um..ok...لا إله إلا الله محمد رسول الله ....""

Him: ""Now, in English: There is no God but Allah, Mohhamed is his prophet!""

Me: ""mumble mumble (I'm basically a new-ager hippy type; I believe in a higher power, but I'm agnostic if anything. I've always felt it was just a lot of silly semantics, 'allah' vs. 'yahweh' vs. 'lord' vs. 'krishna' etc.) So I say something: ""Allah is God, mohammed is a prophet."" 

Him, booming voice: ""CONGRATULATIONS! BROTHER....OMAR!!! THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF YOUR LIFE! CONGRATULATIONS ON MAKING THIS DECISION, I AM SO HAPPY FOR YOU, I AM SO EXCITED!!! TAKE THIS HAT!!""

Crowd: *CHEERS* Every one of these kurta wearing fellows (only 1 or 2 Korean, BTW) comes up and gives me a big bear hug. There is much rejoicing and frolicking.

Me: ""Umm...umm...hey, hey!"" *sheepish smiles, many hugs*

Crowd files out. It's just me and the first Pakistani fellow again.

Him: ""Congratulations, Brother Omar. Now, we just have to get you to go downstairs to fill out all the paperwork, take your picture, that sort of thing.""

Me: ""(WTF? Paperwork? Pictures?) Umm...you know..I'm really late, I have to, um, meet a friend in five minutes down in itaewon central...""

He tried and tried to convince me, but eventually I just kind of walked away. 

Sometimes I wish I had made some bold pronouncement of the folly of organized religion in front of that crowd, but...perhaps I it was a wise choice.

A few of my good friends still call me 'Brother Omar' time to time to this day. I took a pretty good story out of it, along with a white hat which never quite fit me..perhaps there is a metaphor there!",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,,,True,t3_vj3b5,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/vj3b5/white_guy_i_guess_im_technically_an_exmuslim_my/,

The textual integrity of scripture is an important topic in Muslim circles and will be brought up by both Islamic scholars and non-scholars alike. The Muslim argument says that the text of the Qur'an today is identical to that received by Muhammad. However, there are some problems with this argument.

**FIRST PROBLEM**

The most trusted collection of hadith and considered the most authentic book after the Qur'an is Sahih Bukhari but even within it's own book there is a contradiction on who collected the Qur'an.

* Narrated Qatada:
  I asked Anas bin Malik: ""Who collected the Qur'an at the time of the Prophet () ?"" He replied, ""Four, all of whom were from the Ansar: **Ubai bin Ka`b, Mu`adh bin Jabal, Zaid bin Thabit and Abu Zaid.""** http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/25


* Narrated Anas bin Malik:
  When the Prophet () died, none had collected the Qur'an but four persons;: **Abu Ad-Darda'. Mu`adh bin    Jabal, Zaid bin Thabit and Abu Zaid.** We were the inheritor (of Abu Zaid) as he had no offspring . http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/26

If you cannot even agree on who collected the Qur'an then how can you even begin to claim the Qur'an is intact exactly how it was revealed?

**SECOND PROBLEM**


We know from the hadith that Muhammad himself forgot parts of the Qur'an:

* Narrated `Aisha:
The Prophet () heard a reciter reciting, the Qur'an in the mosque at night. The Prophet () said, ""May Allah bestow His Mercy on him, as he has remind ed me of such-and-such Verses of such and-such Suras, which I missed!"" http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/66

* Narrated Aisha:
The Prophet () heard a man reciting the Qur'an in the mosque and said, ""May Allah bestow His Mercy on him, as he has reminded me of such-and-such Verses of such a Surah."" http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/60

* A'isha reported that the Apostle of Allah () heard a person reciting the Qur'an at night. Upon this he said:
May Allah show mercy to him; he has reminded me of such and such a verse which I had missed in such and such a surah.
http://sunnah.com/muslim/6/265

Allah in the Qur'an says that even His messenger might forget certain verses.

Yusuf Ali
By degrees shall We teach thee to declare (the Message), so thou shalt not forget  http://quran.com/87/6

In the below hadith we see that Muhammad's companions also forgot passages of the Qur'an.

* Narrated `Abdullah:
The Prophet () said, ""Why does anyone of the people say, 'I have forgotten such-and-such Verses (of the Qur'an)?' He, in fact, is caused (by Allah) to forget."" http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/63

* Ibn Mas'ud reported Allah's Messenger () as saying:
Wretched is the man who says: I forgot such and such a sura, or I forget such and such a verse, but he has been made to forget. http://sunnah.com/muslim/6/271

If the prophet is forgetting verses then how can you say that you have the perfect unaltered word of God with you?


**Third Problem**

There are claims in the hadith that certain verses are missing. For example the 'stoning verse' for adultery. The present day Qur’an does not contain the penalty of Rajm (stoning) for adulterers, which abrogated the previous penalty.

*  Abdullah b. 'Abbas reported that 'Umar b. Khattab sat on the pulpit of Allah's Messenger () and said:
Verily Allah sent Muhammad () with truth and He sent down the Book upon him, and the verse of stoning was included in what was sent down to him. We recited it, retained it in our memory and understood it. Allah's Messenger () awarded the punishment of stoning to death (to the married adulterer and adulteress) and, after him, we also awarded the punishment of stoning, I am afraid that with the lapse of time, the people (may forget it) and may say: We do not find the punishment of stoning in the Book of Allah, and thus go astray by abandoning this duty prescribed by Allah. Stoning is a duty laid down in Allah's Book for married men and women who commit adultery when proof is established, or it there is pregnancy, or a confession. http://sunnah.com/muslim/29/21


Al-Nurayn and al-Wilaya are two surahs (chapters) that are claimed to be included in the Qur'an by some Shi'ite sects. These sects would supposedly argue that Ali had a different copy of the Qur'an as compared with the third Caliph Uthman. However, these surahs are widely seen as fabrications in most of the Muslim world. Some believe these surahs to be forgeries, intended to increase animosity towards the Shi'ite Muslims in the Sunni world.



**FIFTH PROBLEM**

We know from various sources that the ~~first~~ third caliph Uthman ordered various copies of the Qur'an to be burnt because there were clear differences in the recitation of Qur'an among people of Sham and people of Iraq. The differences were so great Uthman and his companions feared future dispute about true Qur'an. (We are not talking about pronunciations, but the contents). So Uthman asked Hafsa for her copy and he ordered to make many copies of Qur'an and to burn and destroy all the existing copies of the Qur'an. Uthman ordered others to accept Hafsa's copy as the official Qur'anic text. This shows that memorization had failed to completely preserve the Qur'an (meaning recitation) in its original form but help of text was taken.

* Narrated Anas bin Malik:
Hudhaifa bin Al-Yaman came to `Uthman at the time when the people of Sham and the people of Iraq were Waging war to conquer Arminya and Adharbijan. Hudhaifa was afraid of their (the people of Sham and Iraq) differences in the recitation of the Qur'an, so he said to `Uthman, ""O chief of the Believers! Save this nation before they differ about the Book (Qur'an) as Jews and the Christians did before."" So `Uthman sent a message to Hafsa saying, ""Send us the manuscripts of the Qur'an so that we may compile the Qur'anic materials in perfect copies and return the manuscripts to you."" Hafsa sent it to `Uthman. `Uthman then ordered Zaid bin Thabit, `Abdullah bin AzZubair, Sa`id bin Al-As and `AbdurRahman bin Harith bin Hisham to rewrite the manuscripts in perfect copies. `Uthman said to the three Quraishi men, ""In case you disagree with Zaid bin Thabit on any point in the Qur'an, then write it in the dialect of Quraish, the Qur'an was revealed in their tongue."" They did so, and when they had written many copies, `Uthman returned the original manuscripts to Hafsa. `Uthman sent to every Muslim province one copy of what they had copied, and ordered that all the other Qur'anic materials, whether written in fragmentary manuscripts **or whole copies, be burnt.**  http://sunnah.com/bukhari/66/9


**SIX PROBLEM**

The compilation of the Qur'an was clearly a very human process involving trial and error, educated guesses, faulty memories, fallible opinions, disagreements, mistakes, ignorance, and bad decisions. And we can't forget, of course, the pile of manuscripts reduced to ashes by Uthman in his desperate attempt to destroy all evidence that the Qur'an hadn't been perfectly preserved. The early Muslim community left modern Muslims with a huge mess to clean up if they want to cling to the false belief that the Qur'an was perfectly preserved as you can see in this hadith;

* Abu Harb b. Abu al-Aswad reported on the authority of his father that Abu Musa al-Ash'ari sent for the reciters of Basra. They came to him and they were three hundred in number. They recited the Qur'an and he said:

 You are the best among the inhabitants of Basra, for you are the reciters among them. So continue to recite it. (But bear in mind) that your reciting for a long time may not harden your hearts as were hardened the hearts of those before you. We used to recite a surah which resembled in length and severity to (Surah) Bara'at. I have, however, forgotten it with the exception of this which I remember out of it:"" If there were two valleys full of riches, for the son of Adam, he would long for a third valley, and nothing would fill the stomach of the son of Adam but dust."" And we used so recite a slirah which resembled one of the surahs of Musabbihat, and I have forgotten it, but remember (this much) out of it:"" Oh people who believe, why do you say that which you do not practise"" (lxi 2.) and"" that is recorded in your necks as a witness (against you) and you would be asked about it on the Day of Resurrection"" (xvii. 13).

http://sunnah.com/muslim/12/156

The earliest found copies of the Qur'an do not have diacritical marks, and evidence points to 'trifling' changes made to the Uthmanic recension.[3] Multiple people collected the Qur'an after Muhammad's death. Differences existed among the various versions of the Qur'an before Caliph Uthman decided to burn all the copies except one. Muhammad himself forgot Qur'anic verses. Some verses, like the ones for stoning, are missing from the Qur'an we have today. We can thus conclude from Islamic sources that the Qur'an has not been perfectly preserved and today's text is not exactly the same as recited by Muhammad. http://sunnah.com/muslim/12/156

**OTHER PROBLEMS**

Nobody has the original copy of the Qur'an standardized by Uthman.

The most trusted commentary on preservation comes from hadith written hundreds of years after Muhammad.

Early copies of the Qur'an did not have [diacretical](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Diacritical_Marks_of_the_Qur%27an) marks, leaving room for an enormous amount of discrepency.

**CONCLUSION** 

The earliest found copies of the Qur'an do not have diacritical marks, and evidence points to 'trifling' changes made to the Uthmanic recension. Multiple people collected the Qur'an after Muhammad's death. Differences existed among the various versions of the Qur'an before Caliph Uthman decided to burn all the copies except one.

I skipped the fourth problem it was to long. 

This is good to read if you are going to debate with muslims. This is the arguments the christians like Sam Shamoun and Daviod wood uses in their debates and the muslims always lose against them.

And this wasn't even good pork by far, it was microwaved, a tad too salty, a bit too well done for my tastes, and I still found it amazing.

I live in the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. Here, there are a lot of non-Muslim expats. We are also very close to Bahrain, where pork is legal. One of my Christian friends smuggled some pork (yeah, never thought you would read those words, did you?) into the country and brought me a single pork chop to school. I put the container in my backpack and went off to lunch, where another ex-moose (username: IzmailPirzada) and I met up and each had a bite. He'd already had bacon before, so he just took a bite right away, and handed it to me. I hesitated. I was nervous. Somewhere, deep down, a Muslim was crying ""Don't do it!!"" but the atheist was more powerful. I had a bite. I nearly vomited because I was so nervous. But, Allahu Akbar, it was so good.

And those are my thoughts :)

After that, I was too nervous to continue, and I just gave it back to the Christian friend. On Saturday, he's bringing bacon :D",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,,,True,t3_zrgmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/zrgmp/just_had_pork_for_the_first_time_my_thoughts/,

Now the reason I am reading it is to understand the Muslim perspective on revelation. I already know the story but I wanted to reinforce what I know. 

Now a small section in the introduction really pissed me off because of the sheer idiocy. Here goes the part, a westerner asks this question: 

""Finally who is entitled to be an authority on the Quran? Or in general terms, to write on Islam and all its religious history and facts?""

The author answered with this: 

""Certainly anyone can write on Islam, but only a devout Muslim has the legitimate prerogative to write on Islamic and its related subjects. Some might consider this biased but then who is not? Non-Followers cannot claim neutrality for their writing swerve depending on whether Islams tenants agree or disagree with their personal beliefs so any attempts at interpretation from christians, jews, atheists, or non-practicing muslims must be unequivocally discarded. I may add that if any proffered viewpoint clashes with the prophets own guidelines, either expliclty or otherwise, it becomes objectionable; in this light even the writings of devout Muslims may be rejected if they lack merit.""

All I can say after reading that is WOW! This leaves no room for criticism, no room for any honest reading. If you are non-muslim or if you are Muslim and your analysis clashes with the status quo your argument is thrown out or worse you may be accused of apostasy. This leaves no room for anyone to actually look at Islam and what this does is it leaves Muslims with the false belief that their religion is untouchable and that any criticism even from Muslims is not warranted.

I live with a pretty liberal mom but a fucked up crazy dad. I'm 16 and my mom has made sute that my dad doesn't hurt me whatsoever not like he did with my siblings. He's known for hitting and beating everyone within our family even my mom until i was born. My mom claims i made him ease up. 

Yesterday there was a party planned by the city for all people aged between 15-18. I of course see this as agreat opportunity to hang out with my friends one last time before we part ways. I told my mom the party starts at 8pm and finishes at 1 o'clock. She said yes and i even had 2 friends sleeping over. 

Now my dad knew about this but as I missed the bus at 1 o'clock and had my brother come pick me up and my friends. While on the phone with my mom he was shouting in arabic ""let the fucker walk home"" and he grabbed the phone and said ""just wait you just wait til tomorrow"" amd hung up. Now I've done worse in my days so i shrugged it off. 

Well today he calls me and trlls me to stay home until he gets there because he wants to talk. Meanwhile my mom is all cool about yesterday and eager to hear what happened. As my mom is sick she sleeps on the couch and my dad comes through the door. He looks at me and says let's go downstairs and talk. I follow and sit down on the bed.

He starts asking ""where were you yesterday?"" ""As you know at the festival thing"" ""when did you come home?"" "" well i missed the bus and i got her at 2"" this is where i paralyzed. He spit at my face and slapped me so hard. And he's saying stuff i can't even remember. I feel that buzzing sound in my ears. He looks at me and still saying stuff and spits and then hits again and this time laying on me with his fists all in the air wanting to continue. 

My mom wakes up and screams what's going on? And he in his most fake voice. ""Nothing honey"" he then forces me up the stairs and tells me to bring my bus card and my phone (hid my phone) he said i won't be out past 8 and that he'll shut off internet (yeah right)

My mom now knows what's up and gets furious and tells him what's wrong with you? And he said the thing that has made me despise him for all future. ""He's my son if i want to kill him I'll do that"".

My mom came in to my room and started talking to me about how fucked up he used to be and how she want me to get the best grades so when she dies i can move away from him. She sat there hugging me and praying for my good fortune in the future. Do admit that was pretty comforting. She told me that she told him that if he touches me again she'll move away with me.

 I just feel so lost and alone. In 16 years he hasn't layed hands on anyone until today. Mom thinks he's jealous because im more successful with life than what he is but i don't know. Thanks

I used to consider myself a devoted muslim and there was a time in my life when I used to pray 5 times a day and I also used to wake up for tahajjud (a prayer performed at sometime in the middle of the night).  But many times, I thought to myself whether I actually believed in islam or whether I was just trying to please my parents and get better grades in school (I was doing it for the grades). But after my conversion from a muslim to a 'kafir', I started thinking about life after death. Many of the religion's major teaching revolve around life after death and it teaches you to not to fear death. In my state, that wasn't the case at all. I was always scared to die and the sole reason for that was the whole concept of ""heaven and hell"". During my muslim days, I always thought that I haven't pleased god and how I would go straight to hell. But now that I'm not a muslim and don't believe in life after death, I must say, I AM RELIEVED! I'm not scared to die anymore, just knowing that there is no heaven and hell or life after death does not make me fear death at all. When I was a muslim, I always told myself that I'll probably redeem myself when I'm old (in my 60s or something) but now I have nothing to worry about at all and it feels like a burden's been lifted off my shoulders. I can live my 60s now and not give a fuck about god or Moe's teachings.

The ensuing episode of grief and bereavement has sidelined me quite a bit, and prompted me to ask a lot of questions regarding myself.

Last night, my father came to me in my dreams. He gave me a very short yet dense speech, mostly comprised of advice and a subversive yet not-so-subtle call to action.

Judging from the tone of his voice, he wasn't very happy.

Dreams are fairly hard to recollect, but everything my father said was so vivid that they will remain seared into my memories for quite a while.

His advice seemed to be somewhat relevant to my fellow brothers and sisters here, so I figured I'd share.

**NOTE:** Please excuse the language. My father was rather upset, and was about as subtle as a bowling ball hurled at a glass window.

Without further ado:

***********************************************************

Fuck you.

Fuck your fears. Fuck your need to wallow in emotional bullshit that will only serve to leave you suspended in a demobilizing black syrup. Fuck the long walks you take at 3 AM in the morning, thinking you might be able to shake it off.

I’m not here anymore.

I'm not here to give you any reassurance. I'm not here to share dirty jokes with you anymore. I'm not here to watch Looney Tunes and Steve Martin movies together for hours until we lose track of time.

I don’t have much time so I’m going to keep this short:

Never borrow another man’s past.

Never smile at a woman just as you’re entering the restroom.

Never be afraid of death. Death is merely a reminder that you won the lottery. That you are one of chosen few who get to experience the universe in all of its terrifying beauty.

By the way...you must be wondering what happened after I died.

Judgement? Rivers of honey and wine? 72 virgins? Sorry, son.

You die…and then you die. And then you don’t come back.

I know you don’t believe in any of the Islamic bullshit I tried ramming down your throat ever since you learned how to walk. I know we’ve had some disagreements, and I'm sorry I didn't give you much room to think for yourself from an early age. For that I'm truly sorry.

I don't expect you to forgive me, and that's ok. But for what it's worth, forgiveness from you is worth far more than Allah's warped criteria for forgiveness any day.

I know you're an atheist.

Your family doesn’t know it, and I’m pretty sure most of your friends don’t either.

For your mother’s sake, please don’t tell her. She’s all you’ve got left, and she’s keeping herself alive solely on the hopes of you becoming a man.

But you’re not a man yet. Not in my book, you're not.

You want to know why?

Because a real man will harbor a love for his family that is so strong and resolute that it transcends his own beliefs. So strong that it rises above his vitriolic strain of atheism that often gets the best of his emotions. He will care for them no matter what they believe in. He will save any vacuous, low-calorie anti-religious bullshit to himself, suck it up, and give his family their due in respect, and then some.

You don’t have time to let this all sink in. I won’t give you that time. I’m buried under 10 feet of dirt, and the maggots have long since bored through my eye sockets and left me with nothing but my rapidly demineralizing bones, and the Wahhabist shitsticks that buried me didn’t even give me the courtesy of a tombstone with my name on it so that you would know where to visit me.

I’m very much out of time. You, however, still have a couple more laps around the track before you end up where I am.

That’s why I want you to take this advice down your throat like a hockey puck, and get busy kicking so much ass that your own life won’t be able to catch up with you.

I don’t want you to wake up thinking I’m an asshole.

I don’t want you to wake up thinking that I’m anything more than the manifestation of your own hopelessly convoluted, unwarranted strains of self-doubt.

I also really don’t want you to wake up with some misguided notion that I’m not proud of you.

But I want you to wake up a man.

1364723994.0,39,self.exmuslim,1bcorg,The importance of meet-ups: a Toronto story.,caravaggisti,44,5,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1bcorg/the_importance_of_meetups_a_toronto_story/,"Hey everyone, 

We had our Toronto meet-up on Friday. While we had a handful of confirmed (and of course, verified) people set on coming, the turnout was small. Including me, there were 6 of us. Last time, the number was 5. Progress, amirite? Well, despite the small number, I'm of the opinion that it went well. We were in great company. Thanks for organizing this time, boredg!

Now, I'm going to use this as a platform to discuss a few issues: First off, we've consistently had a small turnout for the meet-ups. I mean, it's better than California (sorry, JasonMacker) but much worse if we compare it to our fellow ex-Muslim's in the UK. The thing is is that we're on reddit. Not everyone is on reddit. Imagine how many others are out there? One of our regulars suggested we have regular meet-ups. This suggestion is golden for many reasons.

 - By taking this offline and meeting in person, we are essentially destigmatizing apostacy. If there is a time and place for us to gather, it legitimizes our cause and existence. We need strength in numbers. We would not be alone. And one day, we can ttract those who identify as non-Muslim, atheists, skeptics, ""cultural"" Muslms, etc. Imagine that. Imagine us networking and putting the word out there that we're for real and we have a community that is accepting and supportive -- which leads me to my next point.

 - Support. This subreddit is first and foremost a place for recovery. Most of us don't have that in our day-to-day interactions. Some struggle. Most of us have experienced strguggles. By gathering together, we can be there for each other in times of need. 

 - We can share ideas. We can debate. We can discuss our experiences and continuously learn and grow together. Our meet-ups aren't really circle jerks. Our members that show up have always provide a fresh perspective. Not to mention, some of us were in knee-deep in religion, the religious community and social circles.

So, what I'm saying is -- let's do more meet-ups and let's emphasize staying connected. I'm told by some members who tried to make connections that there is a fair share of paranoia. Some of us really are not in the position to be doing the double life but bear in mind, that's the case for quite a few members who have shown up! We're also good at making good excuses, so, if you need a voucher, we can put on our beards and sing 'Alhamdilullah' into your mother's ear.

My second issue? Not so much an issue than it is a calm and dialogue I wish to create. I want to bring this up in a way so that it should not be inflammatory. The former issue and the one I'm about to discuss are interrelated. The link is gender.

**[I made a post for the 2nd half](http://redd.it/1bcouu)** because my life has nothing to do with the meet-up, minus the fact that I think there's a sausage fest both online and offline. I was the only female there (twice, at least). 

The members I've met over the past year have been exceptionally great, very curteous, both great speakers and listeners, and have always been mindful for me to feel comfortable -- and for that, I thank them for being fantastic individuals.

However, the truth is, is that there's not enough women's experiences to go around. While almost all of us were subject to mistreatment in one way or another, at times, the experiences women face are unique. There is a heavy lean towards science and theological fallacies to debunk religion (as there should be!) but there is not a lot of room on the agenda for women. 

I for one, as you might read in post I've linked to, have a hard time being as eloquent in speech as my fellow ex-Mus. I don't know how to talk about the things that have caused a deep aversion to Islam and my parent's culture. It's hard being the only woman. And that has always been the story of my life. I think the meet-up is important because there might be many more of me out there. I can't be the only one. It would be great to meet others in a similar position.",(Meetup),False,self,t5_2s7k2,1364724986.0,meet,,True,t3_1bcorg,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1bcorg/the_importance_of_meetups_a_toronto_story/,

However, I've noticed a few members of this community express at times feelings of anger and dislike on the verge of hate for many Muslims and other religious followers, often who are their immediate family or friends. Such feelings are probably not unique to this subreddit, but prevalent across a number of former ex-s, whether they are ex-Muslim or other. Being the minorities that we are in our households, communities, and often countries, we sometimes have a lot of good reason to condemn and loathe religious followers. Some of us have undergone severe psychological distress at the coercion of our Muslim parents. Stories abound of how exMooses in this community fear a forced marriage, physical punishment for sharing their disbelief, or are faced with words from their parents like, “[I wish you died at childbirth](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/193u55/i_wish_you_died_at_childbirth/).” Even more prevalent are the news stories we get from abroad: Muslims killing non-Muslims or those of the other sect, those accused of blasphemy or condemning blasphemy laws being harassed or assassinated by rioters, and rape victims being lashed or stoned to death for fornication or adultery.


While you might have all the reason in the world to hate those religious believers including your parents, I would like to briefly list some of my thoughts that I've alluded to in a handful of my previous comments concerning this perspective. At the least, if you disagree, I would like to hear your perspective. Maybe I've taken too seriously certain comments that were only intended to be cathartic rants meant to dispose of angered emotions? Nonetheless, I think those sentiments might hold some truth, so here goes:

1. People are not always religious, because they are stupid, ignorant, idiots. Many have been indoctrinated since their infancy in cultures where Islam has dominated for hundreds of years. It may have never seriously occurred to these people that their way of life is based on falsehoods—that the miracles and stories they've heard about could be false. In a [recent thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1aqo4y/do_you_think_you_would_be_an_atheist_today_if_it/), many of you alluded to the idea that if it weren't for the internet and an inkling of skepticism, you may yet have been Muslims. It may be very difficult for Muslims to really critically think of something that they have been so committed to for their entire lifetime.

2. Many staunch religious believers like some of our immigrant parents have come from countries where the West is viewed as [selfish, immoral, and greedy]( http://www.pewglobal.org/2006/06/22/the-great-divide-how-westerners-and-muslims-view-each-other/). Maybe the West isn't exactly out to exterminate Muslims like some Muslims think, but there is some context to their views. So when and if you come out, your parents and friends might simply interpret this as you succumbing to the Western ways and be dismissive of your logic.

3. My perspective isn't just that the believers aren't dumb and ignorant, but many of them are otherwise friendly, loving, and even talented contributors to society, even in complicated fields. For whatever reason, these individuals hold on to their beliefs. While you and I may be fairly convinced that all religions are man-made, it isn't so clear for others. Our parents, family, and friends might be more inclined to believing in weak and even outright false claims to miracles, but their position isn't entirely one that is fanatical in our modern societies. Again, there is a social and historical context to their beliefs, one that has been held on to by their parents, grandparents, etc.

4. Many of our parents have faced hardships like racism moving to the West. Some may have had an opportunity to better acclimate into their neighborhoods and jobs, while others may have struggled. Muslim community members may have provided good company during those times that helped many families adjust. Dismissing their religiosity would amount to a lot of stress between these relationships.

There are probably many more reasons for why people who are theists and deists believe what they do; I'm just trying to identify a few.

Now, these reasons are not good enough to justify the atrocities that many have committed in allusion to religious texts, but for some reason they do occur. It is a societal issue which we need to address carefully.  My only intention here was to help identify reasons that might have contributed to why certain people you know are the way they are. These thoughts parallel the idea that we are products of our environment. Yes our parents should love us and understand us and accept who we are, but it’s not as simple as that is it. Consisting primarily of individuals in our late teens and those in our twenties, we have to be careful in how we carry ourselves. The reasons for why we do not believe in any of the false logic is because we have been critical and open-minded. Our individual experiences leading to our apostasy may have been very different, but I hope I can say that all of us believe in what we believe in due to openheartedness and reason and not stupidity, ignorance, or foolishness.",Question/Discussion,False,self,t5_2s7k2,1364369444.0,discussion,thecount,True,t3_1b3ihl,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1b3ihl/muslims_stupid_ignorant_fools/,

1357668525.0,39,self.exmuslim,1670no,My mom was diagnosed by gastric cancer stage 4A.,PotatoTomatoe,44,5,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1670no/my_mom_was_diagnosed_by_gastric_cancer_stage_4a/,"First of all, I just turned 18. My mom was all active and happy, she was a strong woman. In all her life she prayed, she told me to pray, she told everyone in the house to pray. I was living an awesome life. She was fun and I loved her. 

I was attending a driving school and each day mom would be so ecstatic to talk to me about my day and what I had done. I used to take her from work each day at 3:45PM with my dad  in case I did something wrong while driving. I was so proud. I was proud... 

In the next month, she barely was eating anything. She would take 1 bit and say she's feeling full. Until my dad said that she needs to go to the hospital to get checked out.

Fast forward another month, she started taking chemo, was slept in the hospital for 2 days. She pleaded dad to take us to her. 

**I was terrified.** I didn't want to see mom like this. I didn't want any of this. I've done everything that she asked me for, she had done everything that God asked her for. I didn't want to see her. Not like this.

But it was inevitable. Once I went in her room with my siblings- I just simply got ... as if my mind was shut off. I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do. It was flu season and touching wasn't allowed for her protection. It was heartbreaking. Her eyes were full of tears. I came close to her bed and looked at her closely, '*Kefek mama?*' I said. She looked down and said '*Al hamdullelah*'. I was enraged. I didn't understand. *'Hamdullelah*' infuriated me. Thanks to God you are suffering? Thanks to God I'm losing you like this? Thanks to God that my little sister won't experience the joy of having a mom?

Another 2 months and I got to know what was wrong with her. She got gastric cancer stage 4A. It's not curable. 5 year life expectancy after diagnosis? 4%. four percent. She probably has a year or two of endless torture.

She had a surgery just a while ago. The first few days we had to go to the ER because she was vomiting a lot. My dad asked me to hold her hand while going down the stairs. The moment I remember how weak, frail 
she was, I become sad, and in rage. I feel I'm at loss. I just can't think probably while looking at her. 

**I'm sorry if this can be disgusting to you** but I need to get this off my chest. The surgery stopped her from pooping. Meaning, she needs to throw up her left overs. Whenever she vomits now, she's literally vomitin feces. Is this torture? This is worse than torture. It pains me looking at her.


No one had cancer in her family. Not her parents nor her grandparents and they lived up to 80 years. Out of all the people in the world, SHE gets cancer? a fucking incurable cancer? Honestly? What fucked up world is this?

**Does God take joy in suffering his followers in front of their children?**





At the age of 18, my whole belief was broken. I don't want to pray to a God that I don't believe in. I don't want to pray to someone that does this. To his own followers. 

I'll move on though. I'll be content when she....
I'll know that she'll be at peace finally. I don't want her to suffer. I can't bear myself not able to do anything to her as she suffers in front of my eyes.",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,1357671613.0,,,True,t3_1670no,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1670no/my_mom_was_diagnosed_by_gastric_cancer_stage_4a/,

One argument given by Muslims as to why Islam is the ""true"" religion is that there is not a single error in the Quran. Hence, shouldn't the entire religion topple over given that the book its based on has even one error?

Now I feel like a fucking hypocrite for thinking like that despite my pro-liberal stance for LGBT rights.

One of the reasons I have a burning hatred for Islam is how much of it's dogmatic bullshit is deeply ingained in my pysche after decades of indoctrination. Even after denouncing Islam, deep inside I still have have a fear and hatred for dogs, pigs, beer, hell, even gays and transvestites, which obviously isn't natural since everyone else who isn't a muzzie doesn't have any of these feelings. I fucking hate how much Islam has done almost irreparable damage to my perception of reality down to the core; It's hard to tell whether some of my feelings are my own or the result of indoctrination.

I'm writing it for myself, but these things tend to garner great advice from y'all so it'll help in that way, too.

I decided to come out perhaps 2-3 weeks ago, for various reasons, but mostly because I'm sick to death of lying. I hate it. I hate doublelife-ing. I also know that this constant need to have to think 3-5 steps ahead has affected many, many other parts of my life, parts that I am working my butt off to get back and grow as a (normal) person in.

I'm getting a part-time job sometime very, very soon, to be able to pay to live out, while still working on my business. However there is a chance I'll put my entrepreneurial dreams on hold and get a full time job soon, as stability right now is most important.

I know I'll be kicked out of my family, and while I knew it'd be hard, it didn't **hit** me, till yesterday. 

*Spoiler alert* I watched Brave with a lady friend of mine, and something felt weird about it. I couldn't place it. The story is about a non-conformist girl, who's mother is very set in old ways, and they discover through a forced magical encounter that they have to accept each other's point of view, and the mother lets the girl move on as she wants.

It just felt weird.

Then, the lady friend turns to me, and says, ""that's a lot like your situation, right?""

And then it hit me. That woman, the mother in the story, reminded me of my own mother. And suddenly, *wham* emotion. I'm totally not an emotional guy (something I'm trying to become more of), but this hit me in the gut. And she realised what she said, and was apologetic. But I told her it was fine, I'm glad, I needed to know that feeling. 

Because I'm going to be kicked out, and I'm not looking back.

My mom may not find out straight away, the shock would kill her. Not sure whether I'll just tell my Dad and ask him to keep it from her (and I'll visit her once a month) or what. But my Dad's going to kick me out. There isn't a but or maybe.

Anyways, I'll be looking for a place in London within a month or so. If anyone's moving here, gimme a shout! I'm an awesome housemate, I can cook, working hard to get ""cleaning"" into my habits, and I throw awesome social gatherings. Would be cool to live in an ex-Moose house ;)

A french friend of mine asked me, quizzically, why would I tell them? Other than I hate lying, why not just live away? The main reason is that I feel that I cannot work on moving the ex-muslim community forward, without coming out. In the UK, the risk is not physical as much as it is psychological. They will try to get to me through my family, especially if I am in the closet. This community has so much fucking potential, and I deeply believe the same about the exMooses' that I've met, and I'm going to make sure we damned well get moving.

For Muslims that are questioning, or even moderate and *unsure*, **what are you issues with Islam, what is stopping you from leaving? Finally, what would most likely convince you finally, that Islam cannot be correct?**

I'll give you what I would answer, 8-10 months or so back, when I was just finished questioning.

**For me, my issues with Islam** began primarily from my life experiences. Some (occasionally, but not always Salafi and always Ahl-al-Sunnah) brothers and sisters were extremely good people, following the Quran in its ""purest"" form. But to see Kuffar, to live, eat, with them, and seeing that, just like Muslims, they had many people with weaknesses, but also the few beautiful people. My best friend, (later my ex), was one of them. I can't tell you what kind of human being she is. Atheist to the core, yet she would sit with the homeless, take part in pro-Palestinian protests (and learn about them), hell, she'd talk to people on the Tube. You don't do that in London. And yet, she is the worst of the worst. A kuffar. Yes, I argued, she could go to Heavan. Remember the Hadith about the dog in the well? But shirk is shirk. There's no getting away from it.

**What stopped me from leaving?**

Simple. I believed strongly that the Quran was the miracle. That it was beautiful. That the science was accurate, and hey, check out the salt/sweet water division. Check out the embryo-chewed-up-like-gum. I shared those books with friend. That was my da'wah.

I believed that Islam was mostly corrupted, but the truth was that it was the Truth. And that humans are weak creatures, and we corrupted something beautiful. My salvation was in the Quran. 

**What likely convinced me to reject my faith?**

Well, ironically (not so much now), it was the Quran. If the Quran is infallible, where every single ayat, every single letter, is the word of Allah, there's a problem when...it...isn't. When you read about the [mountains of scientific inaccuracies](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Scientific_Errors_in_the_Qur'an). When you read about how it looks at [women](http://wikiislam.net/wiki/Women_are_Deficient_in_Intelligence). 

And not once, did I rely on the ""it was for a different people in time"" argument. No. It was for all of mankind. Those scientific inaccuracies, those misogynistic verses, can't be.

So I assumed that the reaction would be more angry and threatening with more restrictions (if that's even possible) until I admit that I was wrong/possessed by a jinn. I had a place to stay and money saved so I was ready. I just didn't know how to bring it up. I brought up the idea of moving out for work and living on my own a couple of times but the answer was never. The only way I would not live with them is if I get married. The night before I decided to come out and leave I decided to test waters and questions my parents about some ayaas. I didnt get anger, only confusion and bewilderment. Why was I asking such stupid questions? I know better than that. 

The next night I told them, it was suppose to be a conversation about having less restrictions and no longer wearing the hijab but it just ended with me admitting that I was no longer a muslim. There was complete shock, how can I not be a muslim? I've always been so good! I'm the best muslim they know! Followed by anger and accusations. But that didnt last long, instead they suddenly stopped and started pleading and crying begging me not to do this and that they love very much. That we would talk and figure it out together. We didn't talk and figure it out, instead I spent a week praying, fasting, and listening to quran day and night until I ""feel better"". They completely ignored the issue, and I was in completely misery and overwhelmed by guilt and the fact that I need to bring it up again.

When I did bring it up again it went very bad. My mother threatened to physically harm herself if I don't pray and do everything she says. I tried to talk to her, told her I love her and that such threats will serve no purpose but she wasn't in a good state of mind. It was bad. I decided that I would just slip out that morning but my mother unfortunately was serious in her claim and ended up in the hospital. So I stayed, I needed to care for my sisters and I seriously began reconsidering just living the rest of my life pretending . . .its not worth my mother losing her life and me destroying my family right?

But that day a bit of good (very surprising) news came through, my mother agreed to get help if I also come and now we are seeing a professional. It's a slow process but I've agreed to continue pretending to be muslim until her health improves. I can be patient for a little more time if it means that my family and I can eventually reach a good compromise. I hope for the best.

When we talk about the women who follow islam being misguided and acting against their own benefit, we aren't being sexist.  We (at least I) are talking from a place of pain, after watching our mothers, sisters, and wives fall victim to this brainwashing.  Calling out that bullshit on this sub is not misogyny.  It is venting.  We have no where else to talk about it, because no one else understands where we are coming from.

No other apostates from any other religion in the world have experienced the gender inequality that we experienced/participated in as muslims.  This is a huge point of frustration and anger for us.  So please, SRS, don't come into this sub and tell us how we should feel and/or act about this.  This is not your sub, it is ours. 

I can't speak for everyone, but I'll tell you how I feel about muslim women.  I feel the same way about them as Liberal democrats feel about poor rednecks who protest against Obamacare.  People who are opposing their own interest/well being/safety.  Islam is not safe for women.  I personally feel that muslim women are brainwashed into believing the exact opposite.  I have the right to these beliefs, and I have the right to share them without being called a misogynist.  So take your overly politically correct sensitivity training back to SRS, and stay out of our business.

Are my feelings coming from a source of male privelage?  No.  They come from knowing the freedom of experiencing how wonderful life is without the soul crushing and life defeating menace that is Islam.  It ruined my life.  It is currently ruining my mother's life, and that of my sisters and female cousins. 

Is there anyting you SRSers don't get mad about?  If I talk negatively about women who don't see the harm they subject themselves to, I'm a misogynist.  If I talk negatively about muslim transgressions and abuses, I'm an Islamophobe.  What exactly is the name of your world, where everybody loves everybody, and religions respect each other and don't cause hardship to women and conflict all over the world?

Just leave us alone.

I argued with them for hours, I was outnumbered by 1:10.  It was so depressing... My cousin sister (she loves me so much) cried and begged me to repent to Allah. They are so brainwashed by Islamic media, they don't understand my point of view. They asked to me not to think out of the box of Allah. I said I will never return to madness of any religion. They said they will ask dua for me....

Now I fear what my parents reaction will be, What will happen to me in future by religious nut jobs. I live in Sri Lanka so I think they can't kill me but they can make my life harder! I thought not to come out until I become financially independent but shit happens, You know how it will be like constantly nagged into following prayers and everything.

1363911726.0,39,self.exmuslim,1arote,Miraculous Quran,zackquaid,41,2,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1arote/miraculous_quran/,"Quran is hardly even worthy of serious study, let alone miraculous. Before brushing off why I say this read on to understand my point of view. Quran makes a lot of claims including those about the nature of this god 'Allah', as well as the nature of our existence and our history. I will use these claims to show to you that Quran is not only NOT miraculous but nothing more than tales of ancients repeated by a raving mad man, who had heard these tales during his travels as well as from his relative Waraqah bin Nawafil.
  
PARADOXICAL GOD OF QURAN - Quran assigns many paradoxical superlative attributes to this Allah character. So much so that Quran gallantly claims that Allah is indeed more merciful than your mother, but at the same time this Allah threatens people in the Quran with eternal punishment for finite sins committed in a finite lifetime with finite knowledge with finite opportunity to study Islam. Any rational person can see that, if a person can conceive greater mercy than this Allah, then surely Allah cannot be the Most Merciful. Therefore, since Allah with his vengeful and punishing nature (and many superlative attributes to convey this nature) cannot be the Most Merciful, because greater mercy can be conceived by mere human beings.  
  
NON-EXISTENT THINGS - Quran mentions many non-existent or never existing things, creatures, people and events, such as Magic, Evil Eye, Jinns, Wall of Dhul Qarnain, Magog, and the magnificent Kingdom of Solomon as real things. The problems with all these things is that should they exist or should they have ever existed then surely we would have had ample evidence of them on Earth. But the state of this world and our history clearly show that these things neither exist nor have they ever existed.  
  
MAGIC - If magic was indeed real, then surely there would have existed in our history due to human greed alone such people as those seeking to use its power to gain fame and fortune. The human greed is often insatiable, and this lust for power would have caused someone in some time and place to use magic in a war or for great evil, or even for miraculous human good. But indeed there is no evidence in our history or our present of any such use of magic or any magic at all for that matter. Those silly people with no control on their own good and bad fortune that you find sitting on street corners of Eastern Europe or Western Asia are NOT magicians and are not capable of causing any good or ill.  Is that not a fantastic coincidence that this phenomenon is no where to be found for scientific examination?
  
JINNS - If Jinns really existed then surely among them would have risen ambitious leaders like Hitler or Napoleon hellbent on world domination, and surely such leaders would have caused wars to have occurred against us humans. In fact, Quran itself claims that Ifrits are indeed very powerful and are even capable of teleporting people and objects across very long distances. Quran even suggests that humans are not only able to communicate with them but also corroborate with the Jinns when it challenges the twain of Jinns and Men to try together to mimic a single Surah in the Quran. Surely, Muslim Jinns must exist on Earth and it must pain them to see their brothers in faith being kicked around and ridiculed everywhere, and yet they are all busy possessing common psycho patients rather than exposing themselves to a trustworthy media source such as CNN, BBC or Al-Jazeerah to prove that Islam is true once and for all. Is that not a fantastic coincidence that these creatures are no where to be found for scientific examination?  
  
EVIL EYE - The concept of Evil Eye is so ridiculous that one need not say more than to say that if it really truly did exist and possessed any real power then surely collective ""Hasad"" of the backwards Muslim nations and their evil eye upon the well developed European cities would have caused those cities to collapse on their own.  
  
WALL OF DHUL QARNAIN AND MAGOG - Quran gallantly claims that Allah allowed Dhul Qarnain to trap Magog until such day (yet in future) as Allah decides, behind a wall made of plates of metal covered by a molten layer of another metal. According to ramblings of Mohammed, these Gog and Magog should number about a trillion by now, and yet with the entire world being mapped there is no sign of wall of similar composition nor of these fantastic dwarfs Magog. In fact I do not know what is sadder than the fact that the bimetallic interactions and ensuing reactions would have rendered structure described by Quran very weak or the fact that even with the entire world mapped and hadiths of Mohammed well studied people still believe in him. Neither this wall nor the people behind this wall actually exist nor have they ever existed, and their tale is not found in any historical documents or knowledge of any ancient men except the Christian Romances of Alexander, well known to be a fallacious document and fairly recent at time of Mohammed.  
  
MAGNIFICENT KINGDOM OF SOLOMON - The fact is that there is no archaeological or historical evidence of the so-called Kingdom of Solomon. If such a great kingdom did actually exist then surely neighboring nations and their writings would have known and mentioned them, but no such documents mentioning Solomon or his father David actually exist. The proud Jews would have surely kept some relics of these great kingdoms such as a coin or something else, except there is no coin nor any such relic to even remotely suggest that these kingdoms really existed.

So what miraculous Quran have you been reading when once scrutinized this book cannot even stand simple rational tests. There is nothing in the Quran worthy of being taken seriously. Even the legal framework proposed by Allah is flawed in that it depends on count of witnesses as strength of evidence against a person rather than quality of witnesses. It demands a minimum number of witnesses for a lot of things, with ridiculous rules like taking witness of a woman as half that of a man. In a system like that a woman raped by a man where she and the man who raped her are the only witnesses, woman's witness amounts to nothing. And that is not the only problem, the problem that this book DOES NOT OUTLAW slavery but encourages sex with sex slaves as explicitly mentioning it as permissible is another strike against this book.

I'm posting this now because I'm not in the best places right now. I'm withdrawing, I'm annoyed t everything, and I can barely handle anything right now.

I talked to my mother on the phone a little while ago. Full of how-are-yous, hope-everything-is-alrights, general chatter. Yet, I can't stand listening to her voice. Every time I do, I feel like crying, especially since she talks to me like everything is okay.

Last time I was at my parent's place, on the day my mom came back from Saudi Arabia, and the day I was leaving to go home, she said those beautiful magical words.

&gt; I wish you died at childbirth.

She came to me to talk about how she feels there is a ""block"" between us, and talked some more about me drifting away from them, and drifting from religion. Not a lie, I suppose. I'm hiding a lot from them, for good reason too.

The talk upset me, I couldn't help it. I was curled up under my covers wishing for everything to be okay, and wishing I could be home already (I had a very very long, very very upsetting Christmas holiday). She came into my room to talk to me some more about things she already talked about. When she pulled the covers fromme, it pulled my sleeve up, and she say it. My tattoo.

Just a tattoo. She slapped it. Hard. And she said ""Allah take you"", among other hurtful things. Then came those words. 

She went and brought my dad into it. They came to me and had some sort of intervention. Like I'm a terrible person. Like my entire life of trying to be nice and friendly to everyone, and helping people who need it meant absolutely nothing because of a tattoo. 

A lot of things came up, including a friend I had. He's a female to male transguy, who also has tattoos and piercings. Again, ignoring what a beautiful and incredibly friendly person he is. 

hey worried I'm trans too. Something I didn't even bother answering. 

My mother told me she doesn't consider me her son anymore (I'm not. I'm her daughter), and that she has given up on me. My dad said something about ""giving me another chance"", as if I did something wrong...

I don't know why I'm typing this. I guess I had to get it off my chest. 

It just hurts how they instantly assume I'm a terrible person for doing something that doesn't even hurt anyone. They consider me a terrible person just because it's ""haraam"".

It also hurts that after all she has said, she still talks to me like absolutely nothing happened. Like she didn't say anything that hurt me more than anything that has ever been said to me. 

So here I am sulking at a bar, having a few drinks, and typing this. Unable to even talk to anyone.

~~A little bit of the background. I did my bachelors in Australia, the main purpose was to go there, become a citizen and support my family and help my siblings migrate as well and settle down here. During my studies I met this wonderful girl who helped me through a suicidal depressive phase and is one of the most supportive people I have met. I fell in love with her and we have been together ever since.~~

~~I knew the relationship was going to come with an expiry date (my graduation date) because my family would never accept her and I refuse to abandon my family especially since soon I was going to be the sole breadwinner. I was honest about this to her and she was alright with it. We kept it secret from my family. Fast forward to about 3 years and we are still together and going stronger than ever.~~

~~Throughout, the shadow of the inevitable break up loomed over our heads. I just couldn't bring myself to leave her, it was the only time I was myself and she was the only person who seemed to want me to be happy. Deep down I started hoping and wondering and praying and pleading with whatever power there was that I find some loophole or convince my family that I simply can't be married off and to leave me alone.~~

~~About a couple of months ago, I started questioning everything I know about Islam. There were always things that made me uncomfortable, the status of women, the rape laws, the blashphemy and apostasy laws, but I always thought that Islam was a source of good (I am quite ashamed of this now) and Muslims were to blame. But I just couldn't satisfy the person inside me with the answers the scholars provided. I then researched sexuality in Islam and I was blown away by how raw a deal women get. I mean I knew Aisha was 9 when she got married but it didn't click until just then and I was absolutely horrified and felt sick. I had been drifting away over the years and it seemed logical to cut the chord.~~

~~It came at a time when I am actually home with my family. They, ofcourse, noticed my use of logic  and reasoning and for the most part agreed with everything I said. They got quite uncomfortable when I debated freedom of speech and blasphemy and told me, it is better not to talk about such things. At about this time my mother started pressing me if there were any girls I was interested in, in Australia.~~

~~I should have known then that it was a trap and that she meant Muslim Pakistani girls but I am a stupid person and I took her at her word that she was interested in my life and my choice and had come around from labeling all non-Muslim women as women who slept with everyone and were never faithful to their husbands. Oh how stupid I truly was and how I regret that now. I was so desperate to talk to the people I loved about the one I loved.~~

~~She listened intently, I told her my gf would even convert to Islam for me (hey not like she cares, not like I am a Muslim anyway) and that I have not committed to anything and I need to move next year anyway so we will see what happens. I deliberately skipped over the part that we have actually been living together for more than a year and that I am quite smitten.~~

~~My mother advised me to keep my options open and not settle just yet and that she will show me some girls as well. I agreed because this was a colossal compromise on her part. We agreed that I should look to finally settle down in 3 years and no sooner and just focus on my career right now. I wholeheartedly agreed because I was glad to finally be able to talk to my parents, who I care about dearly, about the girl I loved. I was just glad to get a line of communication open that I could use to bring them around to my thinking.~~

~~Later the same day, my mom started acting really weird. I knew then that I had made a terrible mistake and braced myself. She eventually broke down and started crying. I was mortified, she accused me of wanting to leave them and move away and that I would become Australian and forget my siblings and they would never be able to see me again. She said my siblings would grow up without their brother and that they looked up to me and why was I doing this to them. I can't describe how painful the entire thing was for me.~~

~~The countless hours I have slaved, doing stupid amounts of hard courses to ensure my job prospects while working as many jobs as I humanly could to support myself just so that one day I could help my family migrate. I mean I used to sleep 2 hours at a time and worked 18 hour days in my final year while writing a thesis. I missed out on tons and it was all for them, to hear her say that... not sure I can recover from that.~~

~~Its been some time since the conversation and I have been pretty depressed since. I have been riding a high for a very long time and this is one of the lowest I have gotten since I was contemplating suicide. Despite what she said, I am not going to leave my family and will probably end up in an arranged marriage just to keep them happy. I even proposed that I am not going to get married until my siblings get married so that it doesn't hurt their marriage prospects. But it fell on deaf years.~~

~~I have learned my lesson and will never tell them anything meaningful about my life again. I am quite shaken up but I will persevere on. I have lost all motivation and it will take a lot to refocus and continue on but people have been through worse. I don't want to give the impression that my parents are cruel and have been unkind to me. I understand that it will take them time to come around, if they ever do and I love them. They did use their life savings to educate me and made tremendous sacrifices for my happiness. And that makes what I have to do all the more difficult. Maybe 3 years from now I will have a happy ending to this story but for now I keep little hope for myself.~~

~~For all the other exMoose out there, hang in there man, it sucks but I am sure it gets better. Thanks for reading my rant and my apologies for the length of my diatribe. It was a long time in the making.~~

Edit: Family confronted me, they knew about everything. I broke down under the very long emotional torture, I couldn't take it. I didn't want to lie anymore.

1342350484.0,42,self.exmuslim,wl8k0,Who was muhammed? Lunatic or a Liar? ,ONE_deedat,48,6,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/wl8k0/who_was_muhammed_lunatic_or_a_liar/,"So what conclusion have ex muslims come to regarding this man. We have an extensive information about his life and the religion of Islam. 

i myself became an atheist before becoming non-muslim, if that makes sense. I looked back at everything and what I conclude tis:

* people of those ages were readily accepting of people claiming to be prophet and muhammed wasnt alone in his time to do this.

* he was a 'good' man from what muslim sources say of his first 40 years

* he has an experience in the cave of hira, of which he wasn't sure about and was scared as sh&amp;t

* other people convinced him he was a prophet rather than coming to realisation himself (e.g. khadija, Bahira) 

* he preached his message to the arabs for maybe 10 years without anyone killing him for it, even though pagans are thought to be like animals etc... By muslims

* this religion was a monotheistic religion of the christians and jews of that area, and basicly a cult inspired by all religions around him, so most things like salah are from the jews/christians. hajj is from the pagan arabs. Sawm is also from the pagans. Zakat was basicly a state tax.

* not many people converted as they had all heard the same stories before from others claiming similar things, and just wanted to get on with their lives. While the ones that did convert was because of his character.

* Muhammed was then sought by the Yatrib tribes as arbitrator between them especially the pagan awz and khazraj and the jewish tribes, because he was known for his good character and and personality, also was like half way between pagans and jews. this offer he accepted and moved to yatrib.

* Now started the second phase of Islam, alot of people give limited credit to the input ofthe immediate sahaba such as Abu Bakr, Uthman, Umar, Ali etc... But I reckon they were greatley influential in its evolution. 

* Muhammed wasnt a dictator rather saw wht his followers wanted i.e. money land property(women) etc... So he gave them God's permission to do e.g. Caravan raids etc... His way of kinda revenge from all who rejected him, and abviously was relieved to get some support after all these years and wanted to keep everyone sweet.

* Now obviously as a man he had his desires so he had what he could get e.g. aisha, but he wasnt into material things and rather found his acceptance of his claim as fulfilling reward, so I think he was deluded into thinking he was actually receiving messages from God although he might have also made up certain verses etc... Thinking thats what Hod would want.

* Most of his immediate companions USED HIM to get wht they wanted i.e. wealth, power and even the ones who didn't believe him jumped on the bandwagon for the spoils. Obviously to these people anyone who was winning wars was supported by God.

* Muslims like to say muhammeds word was final etc... And basicaly he made the laws while others followed but the truth is different, he was always careful not to upset one of his more influential followers. Take the time of his death, he wanted paper and pen brought to him and this didnt happen because of Umar etc...also at the time of the conquest of mecca most people were spared being the kinsman of his companions and also himself, but a man was brought to him who he wanted killed yet was spared because Uthman pleaded on his behalf, Muhammed kept quiet when asked, showing that he was in two minds, i forget the name and what it said after but it was to the effect that idnthey respected Muhammed they would have killed this man without him saying.

Also remember as soon as muhammed died, Abu Bakr and Umar rushed to the meeting of the Madina tribal elders who were already choosing the next leader.

* Islam survived because it united the arab tribes so instead of fighting each other they could attack and conquer and plunder other lands around them, so it was of mutual benefit. A faith such as Islam was needed to keep the empire united. Also the time was just right where the other major emoires were quite weak, so islamic empire spread rapidly and conquered people realised they would be spared if they converted.

My personal favorites:

""In an African family, where both husband and wife were black-skinned, they had a tan-skinned child (like that of an American Indian). When researching this, scientists found that the husband had an American Indian friend and had stuck a picture of that friend on the wall. At the time of conception, his gaze fell on the picture and he thought of his friend; this very thought had an effect on the sperm and a tan-skinned child, similar to his friend, was born.""

""Do not make love in the first hours of the night, with a tired body and a full stomach, as this results in the child being a sorcerer and choosing the world over the hereafter.""

""Thinking of or desiring another woman during the act, as this leads to insanity of the child.""

AND MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE:

""Looking at the private parts of the woman during the actual act, as this leads to blindness in the child.""

If you're a Muslim and you impose your beliefs on others including non-believers. That's bad.

If you're a Muslim and you don't impose your beliefs on others but defend Islam when a fellow Muslim does wrong in its name - that's understandable. Disappointing but understandable.


If you're a Muslim and you're reading this- be aware that there are those who strongly disagree with your religion- not just its morality but its veracity.

Now that you are aware that there are questions regarding Islam's veracity and morality, what will you do about it?

A. You can ignore these questions.

B. You can dismiss these questions outright.

C. You can research these questions and conclude that Islam is still as good and  perfect as you always believed it to be.

D. You can research these questions and conclude that Islam isn't as good and perfect as you always believed it to be.

If the latter is what happens, you can:

E. Continue to condone, defend or even support Islam.

F. Quit Islam.


If you choose any of the following options: A, B or E, then know that I do not respect you.

But unlike some of your brethren (especially those in Muslim societies) my lack of respect does not mean I can't tolerate you having rights - especially the right to exist.

Now dont get me wrong my parents are the best folks a kid can ask for. They work all week for minimal pay and have strived their whole lives just to make mines comfortable.They've loved me unconditionally and ive never had a complaint


Unfortunately once they learn i'm an atheist, the years of indoctrination and brainwashing will make them kick me out of the house permanently.not only that but i'm almost positive they'll no longer have any more hope in life.They believe that if i ever became atheist, they would go to hell for raising a non-beliving son. This breaks my heart to see such good people's lives ruined over religion.

This has unfortunately messed me up for the last few years as I love my parents to death, and hate to see them suffer for literally no reason.

regardless, thanks for reading :) its helped me get this off my chest

Anyway,Dad rests for a while and the prayer starts,as soon as the jamaat offers the salaam - my dad beckons me to leave and we get up to leave.At this point everybody starts staring at us as if we are committing some sort of grave adultery in the mosque and one of the imams sitting at the back shouts at us to sit down as this is not ""right"" - to which my Quranist dad replies coolly that he doesnt care what he thinks and to not argue with him over religion.So we go down - more stares,neighbours looking at us in horror as we proceed to cross 4 stories of muslims still offering their EID prayers and then cross another huge congregation praying outside the mosque.We get home and my Dad coolly smirks that they should know better than to mess with him.

So, he starts talking about the finances and how the mosque is doing good but they're paying interest on the property and how some people said they shouldn't. But, he ends up saying that if we could we should all give the mosque £1,000+ for a year to borrow and then after a year we can get it back or loan it out for another year. He says this is a lot safer than keeping money at home as many people do. He then starts thanking people who gave £1000 each and then a few who gave £2-6,000 each. But then, he says he would really like to thank *forgot his name* for his £22,000 loan thingy. He then steps away from the mic and goes to a small cubord where they store the mic stuff etc and pulls out a decently sized bag. The then opens the top and says ""LOOK!

Thank you to those who personally messaged me. Your gesture means a lot. [Here is the post with my dilemma that I'm referring to.](http://redd.it/1hjdqy)

So, my mother came into the spare room I was in. I tried to act as natural as possible. In fact, I broke the ice and asked her, straight up, what she did with my belongings. She said she immediately threw them out when she found them.

Now, I started to laugh and played it as if I was ""really embarrassed"" because I had been using the condoms and lubes *for the dong*, because I'm afraid of getting a bacterial infection. Since a couple of you were asking, it's called the lifelike dong. It looks like a real penis. Anyway, I told her she had no control over what I do with my body and that I was angry that she threw out my belongings, especially considering it cost me money. 

She asked why I couldn't ""finish myself"" only using fingers. She didn't know if it was normal that girls have toys and the rest. She then kept grilling me that I must have already lost my virginity if I was using a toy. I lied and said I hadn't lost it to anyone. I had to explain to her how the hymen works, that one could lose it simply from riding a bike, tampons, etc. 

My mother, a mother for 4 children, was then extremely concerned about how my hypothetical husband would be upset that I was using these things because it was apparent I was ""hollowing myself out"", I'd be too big, etc. It's actually pretty normal sized.

The pipe, papers, litter of lighters around my room, she was very concerned about. I vehemently denied smoking or smoking weed (especially since I finished smoking it when I went away for the weekend). I asked her when I ever came home drunk, high, or smelling like cigarettes. She said never.  I told her I found these things and she said she didn't believe me because it was everywhere in my room. She got me there. 

She asked me to stop smoking or whatever it was that I was doing. She genuinely believes smoking weed makes you ""insane"" and marijuana will lure me into committing criminal acts. I told her many people smoke it, even people undergoing chemotherapy, etc. She shrugged off my rebuttal. 

For a whole hour after this, she asked me if I had a boyfriend. Denied it. Asked who it was that was picking me up and dropping me off all the time. Said it was an old friend, which it really is. I used to spend a lot of time with my now-ex the past few months, so, I can't really explain to her the situation.

She stressed that I marry an Afghan, marry Muslim. She wants me to stop having boyfriends, find a nice boy, get engaged and move on with my life. She wants to meet my boyfriend, which doesn't exist since I'm just seeing someone, so she can give the okay to marry.

She keeps asking me to get my masters and marry, which is annoying considering, I have no money, owe over 40k in student loans and I'm 22. 

I was actually pretty scared but it appears my mom is more scared. It's clear she's trying to be on her best behavior, considering she didn't tell my father, waited a few days to approach me so she could cool off, etc. I tried bonding with her afterwards and she seemed happy. She's been on good terms with me the past couple of days. 

Anyway, I'm moving out again for school in a couple of months. I'm not going to bring anything into the house until then. I don't want to risk it. 

Thanks again for the help and the support.

A serious amount of drugs and alcohol later, I was still numb and broken inside. Felt shit and was trying to be social to avoid being alone.

Well me and my gf kept talking throughout the whole thing and decided to be civil. Being the gentleman that I am, I decided to offer her a lift to her place as he got back from home today (We had decided for her to get back on the 14th, romantic we thought). Well when she got off the bus, looked at me and turned around without so much as acknowledging me, my heart broke and I thought it was over.

Cue a few hours to her place, I stay over and we chat and we chat. I come with stupid suggestions (I am a dumb fuck) and she explains to me how I do have a choice in the matter and I can just lie to my parents and be with her until everything is settled and they can't actually do anything to me.

Well things started sinking into my thick skull and we have secretly gotten back together. I am going to lie to my parents, feign depression and keep getting out of meeting someone for arranged marriage. I think the key will not to go back to Karachi for another 3-4 years. 

Either way we are taking it slow and its like I woke up from a nightmare. I actually feel happy and realized how much I let myself go.

im a 20 year old female, living in arabia, married to a muslim man. ive never been a fan of religion, and society never have and never will accept me in the muslim country that i live in. my husband is abusive to me because religion tells him that its ok.

a while back, i tried to explain to my family and husband how depressed i feel and showed an intention to leave. in return things got worse for me, and my husband saw me as a rebel woman who needs to be punished.

he emptied out my bank account and took away all my life savings, he sits next to me like im some sort of prey. and is trying to force pregnant me because he believes that that would tame me. [ for safety of myself and my future offspring, im not letting that happen]. i just sit at home all day hoping for my weekend to end or my husband to never come back home.

i have nothing, except for a 1 way flight ticket that i bought. on [date removed for safety reason], i stop receiving bruises.

i should be graduating in less than 2 years, but for the sake of my sanity, thats not going to happen.

in less than 2 months, im not going to have a home, or money, or an education degree, or a family, but im going to have the greatest comfort of knowing that im an individual who can make her own life happen regardless of what she believes. he says im not worthy of independence because im an infidel woman :) i know that he is ignorant and his words dont hold me back.

i still havn't figured out how ill survive, but i do have a plan, im not just an idiot wandering off. my goals and priorities are education, safety, and to keep going.

i know many people browse this subreddit, and some could have a similar story to mine, i want to tell you that you can leave. the hardest step was buying that ticket, after that, it becomes easy once you get over your mental chains that are holding you.

-[i know how much you guys hate grammar and spelling errors, im really sorry, this is the best i can write]-


inb4 this is fake: for the people who were accusing me of being a fake, i dont think you are getting the point of my post, so please stop telling me that you think this might be fake, this is a topic that i cannot talk about to any of my family or people i know in real life, i just need to get it off my chest, try to be supportive, do good without god :)

1351198393.0,40,self.exmuslim,12345g,My parents gave me a very long lecture about why I shouldn't even consider having a female roommate.  I got a gay roommate instead.,eMaddeningCrowd,42,2,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/12345g/my_parents_gave_me_a_very_long_lecture_about_why/,"I have some quirks which make the roommate search a little bit challenging.  Mostly that I always have friends visiting my place and I'm an avid couchsurfer and occasionally like to host other travellers, exchange stories, and enjoy frequent nights on the town.  Having a sociable and Couch Surfing-friendly room mate is fairly important to me.  

After spending the past 3 weeks searching, I finally came across a candidate that fit the bill.  We got talking, started discussing details and she said she'd come back the next day with a final answer.

My parents called shortly after my meeting with her and I let them know I finally found a promising candidate to take in as a roommate and that she's ready to move in immediately rather than start of November.  Immediately, they berated me with a long winded argument about why I shouldn't live with a female.  My mom went on and on about how disgusting the bathroom would be (it never was when I was living with them and sharing with my sister) and how bitches be cray.  Then she went on about how the community would react and gently touched on the religious side of it.

I gave them my smile and nod routine and said that this is my best option for the personality I have and the people I would have around the home - the decision is mine.

Fast forward to the next day - this girl bailed.  Oh well - on to the next one.

Did a couple more meetups with prospective roommates and met someone that fit the bill even better than this girl did.  Really nice dude, well travelled and an avid couchsurfer, sociable, and we have some shared interests.  Towards the end of the interview, he tells me he's gay.  After the lecture from a few days prior, I just started laughing.  Mostly because the first thing I thought of was my parents reaction to it.  To quote my sister, ""Mom is the kind who is convinced that if I have a lesbian roommate, I can be converted and will become one too""

All I can think of now is whether I want to tell my parents.  Obviously, it's better for my sanity and relationship with them not to say anything and just follow the DADT policy with them, but a part of me just wants to see their reaction.",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,,,True,t3_12345g,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/12345g/my_parents_gave_me_a_very_long_lecture_about_why/,
1351130489.0,37,self.exmuslim,121js0,The story of an American convert to Islam,FaithfulJinn,48,11,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/121js0/the_story_of_an_american_convert_to_islam/,"Okay this is the response I made in Kossain's thread where he said he hated converts. It was such a long post that I figured I'd post it again in it's own thread. here it is. It's a long read so beware.

Wow I find this [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/120scj/i_dont_like_converts_to_islam/) pretty goddamn offensive myself being a western convert. Unfortunately though, many of the things you stereotyped about converts are extremely accurate and spot on to how I acted for the most part.

 To give some background my parents are west African descent. My father is Muslim and my mom is Christian. I was born and raised in California. I was never exposed to Islam because my dad never spoke about it, practiced, or mentioned it. He would say bismillah over his food but I never understood why.

I grew up being exposed to Christianity because that's what everyone else was. I was never religious until I turned 18 and hit rock bottom. When I hit rock bottom in life in many different ways I had some experiences and ""found God"". I thought I had to follow a religion so I researched Christianity and Islam. The Trinity, man as God, the resurrection, original sin, atonement, and other whacky ideas of Christianity seemed ridiculous to me so I leaned toward Islam. 

After buying a Qur'an I was duped easily. I was in need of guidance and it offered me a lot of things spiritually. For someone on rock bottom, religion is like a glass of water in a hot desert. It signifies and offers redemption, hope, peace, morality, and relief from a negative lifestyle and at that point in my life I thought I needed religion to be a good person. I started reading the Qur'an and ate it all up. I quickly read the Qur'an and started researching Islamic principles and theology online. I read countless books in my school library about Islamic fiqh, sufism, and history. I must have read 2 books every week from biographies on Muhammad's life to sufi meditation practices.

I started learning Islam terms and started dressing more moderately. I quit drinking and smoking for months at a time though I would momentarily relapse and repent. I began to see evil in everything my friends did. I believed in angels and jinn and did my best to strengthen myself in my faith by constantly invoking the name of Allah throughout the day in everything I did. I truly lived in fear of hell. I called myself FaithfulJinn online because I knew I was going to go to hell regardless of my faith. I was a devil but I was a devil who believed. I began learning prayers in Arabic, took my earrings out (I'm male), and repented everyday for all the tattoos on my body. I prayed almost every prayer and rarely missed one and even attended mosque a few times and seeking out the Arab/Persian Muslims at my school.

I would debate tirelessly online in favor of Islam and felt like I needed to defend it and advocate it online. I gained a deep understanding of the Qur'an because I would study it every single evening and then argue with both Christians, atheists, and other Muslims online about the finer points of Islamic faith. I would also listen to countless Islamic lectures and debates like Ahmed Deedat and Nouman Ali Khan. I also memorized several surahs of the Qur'an in english and every 2 weeks I would try to memorize one more surah or verse. I even got a tattoo of the crescent moon and star on my chest to offset the other tattoo I had before I converted of a phoenix with a cross on my arm. Yeah I know it's haram but at that time I was still young in the faith and I figured God's mercy encompassed all.

After about a year of solidifying myself in the faith I started to feel alienated in my faith. I felt different than the other Muslims at the school. The Arabs/Persians all had their own little groups, and me being not only a convert but African-American, I never felt accepted by them even when they invited me to mosque or Muslim Student Association meetings. When I went to the mosque I felt uncomfortable and like an outsider but my faith was certain. I alienated myself from my American friends by becoming a Muslim but I had no Muslim friends to hang out with so a lot of times I truly felt alone and misunderstood. I was halfway between being a Muslim, and halfway between being the hard-partying pothead I used to be.

Anyway as I became more knowledgeable of Islam and had a pretty decent grasp of Qur'an and Islamic theology I started looking into the Sunnah and this is when I first rebelled against Islam. I thought the Sunnah of the prophet was not divine at all and that it was full of absurd bullshit. This was my first deviation. I became a Qur'an alone/Qur'anist Muslim soon after I started studying hadith. Because of this I was further alienated from any of the Muslims of my age group because they were all Sunni Arabs. It was bad enough I was black but to reject the hadith? Yeah right.

In my second year of practicing Islam I joined the U.S. military. For me it was out of necessity but it was also a sort of personal jihad against extremism. I would restore Islam's name by showing that Muslims can work toward good while at the same time fighting against extremists. I prayed to Allah that if I got sent to Iraq or Afghanistan and was struck by an IED that he would kill me instead of losing a limb. When I joined the military I became even stronger in my faith because a lot of the people around me and the culture in general were bigoted against Islam so I felt a bit persecuted and as alone as ever.

When I got back home from almost a year of military training it became hard to get back into Islam. Even when I was on active duty I still prayed almost every single prayer and I studied Qur'an a lot. I had nothing better to do with my free time than to pray, read the Qur'an, and do pushups in my barracks. After I got home I found it hard to continue. All of a sudden it felt more empty to me. The prayer and the fasting seemed like going through the motions. I couldn't really feel Allah in my life anymore. I stopped praying and started hanging with my old friends again. I still believed but my faith was weak. I put my earrings back in and stopped being ashamed of my body.

I would feel guilty every single day but I still believed strongly in Allah. I just couldn't bring myself to continue with the rituals. After a few months of this I started doubting if God was real at all. I still invoked his name constantly and believed but I felt like the conversation was one way. I would try to read the Qur'an like I used to but the verses offered less and less consolation and guidance. The Qur'an no longer seemed as magical as it used to. On the internet I became exposed to atheist arguments and they made me angry. I hated atheism. It scared me and shook me to the core to think Allah wasn't real and I was wrong. I wondered why I was such a bad Muslim and couldn't practice like I used to. The seeds of doubt had been planted but I didn't know it yet.

I eventually gained the courage to question my own beliefs. I was confused as to why I couldn't see God in my life anymore and why God didn't answer my prayers. Eventually came across a video on youtube from ""strangestdude"". It was called ""Why I'm Not a Muslim"" and he explained why he left Islam. It was the first time I saw an ex-Muslim argue against Islam and he calmly and reasonably explained everything. From that day I was shook. I worked graveyard shift by myself at work, and I would spend hours alone having conversations with myself about the world, the universe, the nature of life, arguments for and against God, and if my beliefs were really founded in anything. It was the first time I TRULY entertained the idea that maybe God wasn't real. 

I decided to study the Qur'an objectively and look for inconsistencies and contradictions and immorality. It was the first time I read the Qur'an from the objective and skeptical perspective instead of the apologetic perspective. After a few weeks of this I wavered back and forth between disbelief and belief. Eventually I concluded that the Qur'an was not in fact the word of God or any divine being. It was the words, thoughts, and opinions of a delusional 7th century Arab man, and I had spent the last 3 years of my life trying to appease this book. I had come out to my family and friends as a Muslim and totally changed myself because I believed it was true. I was so humiliated and devastated and disillusioned and hurt at first. Everything I had thought and hoped and prayed for was wrong. Everything I did was in vain and all the pain I had suffered through while thinking that Allah was closer to me than my jugular vein was actually suffered alone. 

I had felt so much guilt and denied myself so much pleasure and joy and totally changed my lifestyle based on a lie. I had tattooed my body with religious tattoos (I have praying hands with the crescent moon and star, the ark of the covenant, and a quote on my chest) thinking that my tattoos like my faith would be with my in my grave. I had been lied to.

I very quickly became an agnostic atheist after this. I'm not bitter toward my years as a Muslim or even my religious tattoos that I began getting before and during my conversion. To be honest my tattoos still look badass and tell a story of my faith. I'm not bitter that my time as a Muslim helped me find myself and see the world in a different way, nor am I bitter that it changed me. I'm happy with who I am today and I feel more free than ever and will continue to grow, with or without Allah.  

This was a long post so I'm also going to make my own thread on the page in case people don't see it in this relatively large one. I didn't expect it to get so long but I wanted to tell my story as best as I could. Hopefully it didn't hop around all over the place too much and was coherent enough to read because I know it was all a wall of text.

*The question isn't directed at those among us, struggling to get by. You need to survive before you can thrive. This question isn't directed at those not interested in bringing about change. Not everyone has to be an activist or ''fight the good fight''.*

That being said, please do leave a comment on what you think could be done to help things better.

_______________________________
It's not easy bringing about change when:

* When you can't come out in the open for fear of ostracism, imprisonment or death.

* When you lack the numbers, organisation or resources.


However even on a tiny subreddit like this, you do see people who have made an impact (however tiny).

Off the top of my head (DB is offline currently- **please forgive any omissions or errors**), a few examples include:

* AgentLiquid- founded this subreddit. Got things going.

* akuma87- did a lot of the initial posts regarding the hadith and quran- compiled over at /r/qurans and /r/hadith. Currently rumored to be fighting the good fight over at his homeworld.

* Ash09- responsible for the behind-the-scenes technical stuff for the subreddit. Hopefully will return June 2013.

* Big_Brain- Promotes a critical and rational method of discussion. Crazy enough to subject himself to reading up on the Quran, hadith and the history of Islam. *Good thing he's on our side.*

* scumbag_humanist founded /r/exmuslimdating (not just for dating!) The meetups over in the UK and Canada were a result of this subreddit.

* Meenakustard &amp; Improvaganza- organised the UK meetups. The most tangible impact thus far.

* tentativetuna- organised the Canada meetup. How aboot that...

* Girl7 - came up with the idea of the [online chat group](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslimdating/comments/uik9q/a_solution_to_the_chat_issue_what_do_you_think/).

* zulaikha_idris - ~~throat punching violent extremists~~. Created a post over at /r/atheism that briefly shifted their focus to Islam (aka the post that launched a thousand memes).

* Nod_Flanders - [gave a shoutout to /r/exmuslim from the site of the Kaabah itself!](http://i.imgur.com/K1UdU.jpg) ~~Stupid~~ Awesome Flanders.

* cfdlabs - *old man who set up the auto-feed on r/exmuslim's twitter account*. Also trying to raise his kids right- a commitment for life!

* fylow - designed the current logo and look  of the subreddit.

* lalib - mod over at /r/progressive_islam. ~~Working to destroy the enemy from within~~ Working with what might be our best allies.

* ryua - a contributor over at Skepchick. Currently in the process of writing a book: [A Skeptic's Guide to Islam](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/skepticsguidetoislam/a-skeptics-guide-to-islam). 

Special mentions:

* balqisfromkuwait - a Muslim who will soon release a book about Islam. Talks of an Islam where apostasy is not a crime punishable by death- among other ideas. 

* Taqwacore - mod over at /r/progressive_islam. An Islamic subreddit that is more open to discussion.

*Not all the people mentioned above are members of /r/exmuslim. I also don't necessarily agree with all of those mentioned or their actions.*

*There are probably many I forgot to mention. I have also unfairly summarised achievements (based off my perception) in a sentence or two.*

So, I decided to create a new post for the story.

I was sitting with my mom while she was watching ""Zindagi Gulzar Hay"" (Pakistani TV Show) and I noticed the main character in the show was pretty conservative. He said something like ""men should be the dominant gender in a relationship"" and I told mom I disagreed with it. She said gender roles are very well defined in Islam and that's what the guy in the drama is doing. I asked her if Mo and Allah really did a good job at defining gender roles and if she was cool with men being allowed to beat up women. She said that isn't true and Islam does not condone violence towards women. I said it's in the Quran and showed her verse 4:34 which clearly states men are allowed to strike women. She still was not satisfied and said maybe the actual meaning is different and how I should not draw conclusions without knowing the actual meaning behind it. She said I should talk to Muslim scholars and get my answers from them. I told her that won't really be helpful because their answers will be biased and the only way to view in a neutral manner was by reading the translation and hadiths. She agreed with me on that.

Then the topic changed to science in Quran. I told her she was wrong again and gave the embryology example. I told her any parent would be able to tell how a baby is born because whatever is in the Quran is what anyone in that era could have observed. I told her hadiths on the solar system, decomposition of matter and Muhammad being able to pick the wife for the night, and asked her how outrageously stupid that was. She said she agreed with my arguments and she had doubts too when she was young but realized there wasn't any religion that was better. I told her there isn't any better religion because Islam was introduced after Christianity and Hinduism so it is more modern and more, uh, complete than the other religions, but that doesn't make it a perfect religion. It does not even provide any evidence on the existence of a God.

After talking about scientific inaccuracies in the Quran we talked about the contradictions in Quran and she said that was because Quran wasn't written in a day. I asked her if God really was the creator it would know the future would be like and could have avoided those contradictions. Let's assume Quran was written in the span of a century, how many contradictions would be in the Quran?

The conversation went on for three hours. She did tear up when I told her I did not believe in an afterlife and it is harder for me because this is all I got and I have got to live it to the fullest with her by my side. We talked about kids and I told her if I have kids she can tell them about Islam as long as she keeps it neutral and doesn't force it on them (I do not plan to move out after marriage). The kids should be allowed to decide what they want to believe in.

Then we talked about namaz and she asked me to pray for her even tho I don't believe in it. I told her it was fine as long as she knows I am only doing it for her and I don't think there is any sawab for either of us because there is no God according to my views. She said that was fine.

After the conversation ended, she went to her room. I could not sleep that night because I had mixed feelings over whatever that happened. To my surprise, she was totally normal to me the next morning. We had a casual conversation about general things and it didn't seem like the conversation on atheism occurred at all.

I am glad she did not overreact over my beliefs and listened to my arguments like an adult. I did cut down a lot to keep the post short so if there is anything in particular you want to ask, leave a comment and I will be happy to answer. :) ",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,,,True,t3_1c1ed2,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1c1ed2/so_i_came_out_to_my_mom_details/,

Is that part of you divine plan? What gain came from letting people suffer while you could have performed a miracle? Or you only intervene to make a sport teams win? And how come you stopped performing those physically impossible miracle when humans invented cameras? You know what motherfucker; fuck your divine plan. Fuck your mysterious ways. Fuck you.

If you were sending me to hell go ahead and do it, I want to be in hell away from all your boring stupid people who plan their lives according to blind faith. Why would you consider blind faith a virtue and put scientists in hell? I fucking hate your guts so fucking much. Put me in hell, at least I will have a goal; that is to get out of hell and destroy you.

By the way, which one are you? Jesus? God? Allah? Krishna? Buddha? And since you exist, does the others exist too? do they have their hell and heavens too? And how come you let them pretend to be you? Are you that weak? Or are you just an evil prankster who wanted to put more people in hell than people in heaven? I am fucking hating you more as I am writing these lines.
Fuck you and fuck all those who believe in you. Believers! You don't deserve those nervous cells in your brain if you are not going to use them.

I really don't know where else to post this so I'm going to post it here. I am a 18 year old, half Jordanian (my dad) half black girl. My dad was never really in my life being that he was convicted for armed robbery and grand theft when I was young. I have always been interested to learn about my Jordanian half but have never really had the chance. My mom moved away from the state we lived in when my dad got sentenced. She says they both were young and stupid and that his parents and my dad never got along. 

About two months ago 18 months before my dads sentence is set to end, he gets killed in a prison riot. It was hard for me because I was so looking forward to meeting him. I told my mom I wanted to go to the funeral his family was holding. She was highly against it but at the end let me go. So I call around and find out the mosque and prayer time, and drive over 5 hours to get there. I was so nervous going in. I'm personally not religious but I have always been interested in that aspect of my life.

 So I cover up in a shawl and head scarf and go to the mosque. I'm already given weird looks when I walk in but I line up and pray with them. After the prayer I'm approached by a nice girl about my age she ask me who I am and I tell her, then she hugs me and tells me that she's my cousin. She introduces me to her sisters and they tell me sorry for my lost and then she says do I want to meet my uncle. I have never met the guy so I say yes. When I meet him he goes from calm to furious in under 5 seconds. He tells me to come with him outside. Where he yells at me telling me how dare I show my face in here, that I'm a bastard child and a abomination against his family. I breakdown and start crying. He tells me to leave before anyone else sees me here, and that now that my dad is gone I have no ties to the family. 

I just want to know how can you be so mean to someone you never met? It's not my fault I didn't ask to be born into this family. I didn't want any of this. My mom has no siblings and her parents or dead. I guess I just wanted some kind of family. I thought islam was suppose to be about acceptance and understanding, I just wanted to know where I came from. But I guess at the end that like me was a mistake.

I keep hearing Muslims argue that Islam is the fastest growing religion in the world? Seriously? A quick Google search will prove that every religion makes that claim. Which religious leader would actually want to stand at a podium and say ""Ours is not the fastest, it's actually in second place, but come on guys, if we try really hard we can get there!"" Obviously no religion would want to feel inferior, so everyone of every religion will declare this annoying statistical mishap. I really wish someone could point me to true hardcore facts and figures on what the growth rates of different religions are.

Secondly, when I was growing up I was always taught that Islam was the only pure and complete religion. My ex-girlfriend who was a fanatic (but wasn't when it came to what she wanted) made that fact clear to me many a time when I raised my doubts about Islam. Muslims keep saying that their religion is superior to everyone else's religion, it frankly makes me sick. Why can't you just keep that fact to yourself and learn to live with someone else. Why is human nature so inevitably conflictual in every manner? It's equivalent to playground bullying until you finally concede with what the bully wants you to do. When I was growing up I hung around with kids of various religions and the rare times I got into fights, it was always the Muslim kids that brought up the argument that their religion was complete, the best and superior. Superiority complexes aren't healthy.

I understand I may be generalizing Muslims and this subreddit is on a mission to spread positivity and not the negativity I seem to possess at this moment. But it needs to be said, perhaps more than once, perhaps all the time to remind you of the absolute great decision you made when you decided to leave Islam. You left a religion that poisons you slowly from childbirth until it eventually makes you a bitter human being unable to enjoy the short 60, 50 or heck even 20 years of life that you may enjoy. Go out and fucking enjoy your life, do everything you can tomorrow and say fuck it to anyone who wants to stop you. You're better than a huge proportion of people in the world dedicated to shoving their culture, beliefs and traditions down the throats of everyone they meet. You don't have to put up with rules, chains and demons haunting you in your afterlife, you realize and understand that you have a short time so you should do what you love, marry who you love and live life the way you always dreamed of living it.

Love your parents even if they want to make you curl up and die. Realize they haven't been brought up the way you have, they were indoctrinated harder than you because without the internet or proliferated media they had no access to second opinions or what other people had to say. They had no access to discussion boards filled with people around the world, they could discuss their doubts with. They may shun you, they may say they hate you and they may eventually kick you out all in the name of religion. But don't make the same mistake they did, don't hate, you accomplish nothing by hating. Love them for their flaws, even if their flaws cost you your freedom. You will come out the better person in the end, I promise you, everything will always get better in the end. You can't see it now, you'll call me an idiot now but eventually when you wake up and realize you're free, you'll understand what I'm saying.

Break your bonds and live your life. It's fucking short, trust me I know it's short. You have too much to gain and too little to lose. Love as much as you can and forget what horrors you were taught.

Well I am still here. I poured the hydrogen peroxide into the hydroquoinone, and absolutely nothing happend. It didn't even get warm. Of course I knew it wouldn't I am not that foolhardly. The statments that these two chemicals, when mixed togheter, literally explode is quite simply false although it is regurly repeated troughout creationist literature.

While talking to a friend, I came to realize one very key aspects of my personality were rooted in growing up in a Muslim household: I am introverted.

Being a Muslim girl and growing up with my family, I was forced to greatly compromise socialization, to the point where making attempts were such a burden, I stopped. Hanging out with people became some mental baggage that I didn't want to deal with. And while I've always gotten my energy from being alone (the key to introvertedness) I'm also natural around people. Had I been given a chance to socialize freely, I believe I may have been molded into someone much less introspective and pensive. And even more extremely, I believe liberated socialization would have prevented my apostasy. 

Other things I was prevented to doing/learning included sports, (had a third degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, before my mother pulled me out because it was immodest and unfeminine..) singing (made concert choir but was discouraged from continuing to sing and wasting my credits,) and dancing, which I have recently found I'm pretty good at.

I wonder how different I might have been had I not grown up in this world.

I feel especially elated that day. 

In one of my university's buildings, I notice a table the MSA set up, littered with copies of the Quran and other Islam-related pamphlets. I walk by them and do a double take. Immediately, the young man greets me -- which is a first, because of over the years I've gone to the MSA's table, no one would talk to me. I usually loiter and the guys avoid eye-contact. 

""Hello,"" he says.

I ask, ""Is there a prayer space upstairs?""

He lights up. ""Yes, yes of course we do. Would you like to see it?""

Well, first, I say, ""Is there a separate prayer space for the women?""

""Oh, yes, of course!"" He thinks I was making sure the spaces were separate and thinks that was a selling point. This dude didn't know what was coming next cause his smile wiped right off his face.

I look at him and I say, ""Don't you think there's something wrong with that? Why is the space segregated?"" 

""Oh, well..."" He just starts pulling out the usual points. ""It's -- it's distracting.""

""Distracting to whom?"" I ask. ""I mean, you are praying in a group after all. What makes praying more distracting than to have to deal with a whole group doing it at the same time in a room? Why does gender matter?""

""Well, you know, the women may feel uncomfortable.""

""Uncomfortable how?""

""Well, some people need to focus. They must be alone."" 

""Then why not have private rooms for individual praying? Are you implying that men, in the immediate company of women, will begin thinking thoughts of a sexual nature?""

""Yes! Yes!"" He exclaims, ""Just that. Men have testosterone! They're aggressive. They will think of it. We're wired that way.""

""Wait, well, what about societies and groups of people where nudity, even amongst children, was the norm? Even in the most non-sexual nature. Like aboriginals,"" I say.

""No, no,"" he say, ""Nudity is always sexual.""

""What did humans do before they had clothes?"" I ask.

""Well, that's something else."" He starts to look annoyed until a smile appeared on his face.

""If we were to avoid nudity,"" he says, ""we could prevent a rape.""

""What? Are you implying that a nude woman deserves to be raped?""

""No no no! I did not say that,"" he yells. ""But dressing like that will make it happen.""

""Well, what you're implying is that it is a woman's fault for being raped because they weren't covered. And if she's naked, she's asking to be raped? People will get raped regardless of what they wear. Rape is not about sex. It's about power.""

By then, there was a group of 6 people around me listening to our exchange. Everyone, goes awww yeah. They start murmuring, yes she's right. 

The dude puffs his dainty chest out puts out his finger, wags it no. ""That's very debatable,"" he says.

At this point, there's this dude beside me that says ""Well, hold on we have rules.""

The dainty guy I was debating, points at the table between us.

""It's in the Quran, our holy text, and in the writings of muhammad and his life and his words. It's called the hadiths.""

I'm then reminded that these guys think I'm some white chick.

The guy beside me says, ""See it's in there."" Beside him is a hijabi girl who was there from the beginning of the debate. He looks at her and says, ""Here, ask her. She can explain it to you. Don't you feel uncomfortable praying with men?""

""Don't drag her into this. If she wants to talk, she can answer,"" I said.

The girl laughed about it.

""Uhh... Well, you know what I think it is? It's cultural. I mean if you go to the most holiest place on Earth -- you know, Mecca --  men and women pray there side by side,"" she says, looking at me. 

""But the thing is though that they are moving around in a circular motion,"" she says, using her right hand to make circles around her left fist to represent the Kabah, ""they aren't standing still together to be distracted. Since you are in perpetual motion, there won't be the chance for distraction. So, I guess you're not really praying together, side by side.""

""But here though,"" she goes on, ""we separate because we are far away from that holy influence.""

I actually couldn't help smiling the entire time.

Oh man, they went back in a loop. The dainty dude's friend at the table, picked up the Quran. ""Some of it is here,"" he says, flippping the pages like a flip book.

The dude who pushed the hijabi girl into the debate noted that the details for praying are in the hadiths. 

""Right,"" I say. ""I have to get to class.""

The scrawny dude I began the debate withjumps in.

""I don't think I answered this for you. I did not answer this well because you have the look of unsatisfaction. Where are you going to class? He says.

I say, ""In X building.""

""Oh!"" He pumps his fist down, ""I'm going the other way. I would like to show you the prayer spaces.""

""I've seen them before. Anyway, you should think of a better answer and have them ready, considering you have made gender designated spaces on our campus. Thanks for the discussion though.""

I step away when he tells me to wait.

""Would you like to take some of this literature with you?""

I come back and lean over the table, eyes glazing over the different books.

""Oh, no. I read most of the quran and quite a few of the hadiths.""

The dudes and the people around me smile.

""Wow, I'm impressed,"" he says.

Again, I'm reminded that they think I'm a white chick. They think it's some miracle that a white, maybe jewish, maybe catholic girl read the quran and some hadith - like when Muslims invite white people over to break fast during Ramadan. They get all giddy and proud.

I look at the quran and say, ""I'm not Muslim anymore.""

They all get this sunken look on their faces.

""Well, thanks again."" I waved goodbye really quicky before turing around and going the complete opposite direction of the table. Turns out though I went the wrong way. In fact, the opposite way of where I said I was originally going.

I took the detoure for my pre-class coffee.

* Name of the capital, languages spoken, religious status.

* Brief history.

* How Islam is perceived in your country/culture and how (if) it influences it.

* Top 5 things your country/culture is famous for.

[The Miller-Urey Experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller-Urey_experiment) - Replicating earth's atmosphere during when life was first thought to have formed, amino acids (aka the building blocks of protein, aka the building blocks of DNA) were made. You don't need God to explain the origin of life

[The long term e. coli bacteria experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._coli_long-term_evolution_experiment) - shows that drastic changes in physiology are very much possible. The ability to process citrate as opposed to undigested nutrients is a huge step. The diversity of life and the faux concept of ""macroevolution"" don't require God.

[The Omo Remains](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omo_remains) - At 200,000 years old, they readily disprove YEC, but beyond that, they also have several anthromorpholical traits that tie them to our predecessor [homo heidelbergensis.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homo_heidelbergensis) God was not only not necessary to create man, he just plain didn't.

[The evolution of morality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_morality) - This, in light of looking at the nature of social animals (elephants, dolphins, chimps, wolves, vampire bats, etc.) shows that animals feel compelled to help one another, reciprocate good/bad deeds, be monogamous, etc. and there isn't one single bit of human morality that is exclusive to humans. You don't need a God to explain morality

[The first law of thermodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics) I've never said that God couldn't create energy/matter if he existed, but if the creation of matter/energy is why anyone believes, it's moronic. There's no compelling evidence to suggest that energy/matter has ever been created, only rearranged. The big bang theory is specifically an explanation of how the pre-universe conditions developed into an expanding universe. Until the first law is reconciled with it in some way, it is by no means the beginning of existence (but a good explanation of the big bang and pre-big bang conditions is [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ImvlS8PLIo&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=2486s) You don't need a God to explain the origins of the universe, and there's no reason to think existence ever was created

[The Chaos Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory) - It's a retort for ""complexity denotes creation"". Everything is infinitely complex, there's no reason to say that the universe has any more need for a creator than the current form of a very much non-designed rock. You don't need a God to explain why the universe is complex.

[Heat Death](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_death_of_the_universe) - Theists quite often argue that the universe is too ""fine tuned"". The degeneration of everything into heat is the best example of how this universe is NOT fine tuned. That the sun will expand into a red giant and swallow the earth, or that the andromeda galaxy will eventually crash into the milky way and glomp the whole thing are more reasons. The earth is by no means fine tuned for life over all. Only on the top layers does life exist and we live on the most chaotic planet in our solar system. We go through ice ages, seismic and meteorological disasters, and the occasional meteor. It's not fine tuned for humans, it's 2/3 salt water that we naturally can neither drink nor live in, it's filled with animals that would eat us given the opportunity, which is not to mention viruses, bacteria, and GOD AWFUL [parasites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina_worm) The universe isn't fine tuned to our lives. You don't need a God to do something that didn't happen.

[The God Helmet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet) - Theists often use experiential ""evidence"" to claim that God is proven by spirtual experiences. [Psilocybin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin#Mystical_experiences) does the same thing as the god helmet and shows that it doesn't take a God to make that kind of experience.

That's why I'm an atheist. Philosophically, if you have a positive claim like ""God exists"" you need to prove it with a compelling argument. (all the hole-y books usually have similar merit corroboration despite being mutually exclusive + internal/external contradictions) There are no theistic arguments that are compelling. There is no reason to think a God exists.",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,,,True,t3_xm2y2,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/xm2y2/some_scientific_evidence_experiments_and/,

Even during the summers, I've had to do hifz instead, or focus on leading Taraweeh. Last year I tried to take a summer course instead of leading Taraweeh and ended up getting physically beat for it. He kicked me while I was lying in bed, and then got pissed off at me for ""raising my hand"" against him even though I was raising them to defend myself. 

This year it happened again, I had to lead Taraweeh and I spent all day up in a room revising for the evenings, and at the end of the month they gave me $500 for my efforts. I didn't want to lead. I have student loans to pay off, and nobody is paying them off for me.

There are a couple of things about this religion (really, all religions, in a broader sense) that seem like it could have been created by a 6 year old child having a tantrum.

1. Punishment and Reward: Children's behaviors are dictated by a rigid, black and white understanding of good and bad. Doing something good will get you rewarded, and doing something bad will get you punished. (See [Kohlberg's theory of moral development, Level I] (http://webspace.ship.edu/cgboer/genpsymoraldev.html) and [Piaget’s theory of cognitive development, Preoperational stage] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piaget's_theory_of_cognitive_development#.28Pre.29Operatory_Thought).) Quranic law dictates the same. It makes no clarifications about extenuating circumstances, much as a child who has no understanding about the larger word wouldn’t. A woman *has* to cover herself from head to toe regardless of climatic, cultural, professional or whatever factors. A man *must*....(Ok, I got stuck here. Couldn’t think of anything a man is obligated to do.)

2. The Power of Numbers: Children make up arbitrary rules when they play or argue. You have to count to 12 before you can open your eyes when playing hide and seek. Same with rituals in Islam. There is no reasoning behind odd numbers (3, 7, 9) being more prevalent in prayers and rituals than even numbers. Also, simple maths. Praying alone is rewarding, praying with x number of people is x times rewarding.

3. Methods of Problem-solving: The answer is beating. Or stoning. Or death. Children scratch, hit, bite each other when they don’t get their way. Similarly, a man should beat his wife (‘lightly’) if she disobeys him. If his children do not start praying by the age of 7, they shouuld also be beaten (‘lightly’). Never have I come across a Hadith or passage in the Quran that advises each party to sit down and have a logical and articulate discussion about their issues.

I'm not a psychologist or theologian by any stretch of the word, but these are some characteristics I began noticing after doing some extensive reading recently. I don’t want to use the word primitive because at the time, this religion was groundbreaking, and I’m trying to stay relative here, but this is essentially what it is. All religions are primitive because they appeal to the helpless, childlike, nature within. Some of us move beyond this, past it, and others cling to it stronger.

If you didn't already know, I'm a soon-to-be 19 year old female living at home; I have 4 brothers (I'm the fourth child) - I get along with the oldest and youngest and only the oldest has moved out so far. The middle two I absolutely cannot stand for so many reasons.

I'm getting so fed up with having to PRETEND. Once upon a time I put in a real effort to make it look like I was ""devout""; lately though, I just don't feel like bothering. I almost wish a family member would find something ""incriminating"" in my room and out me: alcohol, a tampon, I don't know.

Maybe before I was 18 I didn't mind changing my clothes as soon as I got out of the house, but now I'm finding it childish and insulting. I didn't mind getting male friends to drop me off a block away, but now I find it embarrassing. 

A little while ago my mom and I got into the topic of people moving away from home and she nearly flipped on the subject of ""GIRLS DO NOT MOVE AWAY FROM HOME UNTIL THEY'RE MARRIED THAT'S NOT HOW WE LIVE A GIRL LIVES WITH HER PARENTS"" when I mentioned how many girls give up amazing career opportunities in different cities/provinces simply because they need to stay with their families in Deadmonton while the males can travel and do whatever the hell they want. 

The past few months have been really hard for multiple personal reasons and I've been having a rough time. I started smoking (bad habit, I know) around November and recently my mom &amp; brother found out and ever since then she's been Gestapo on my ass (well, she went full Gestapo since January when I guess she started distrusting me for whatever reason).

What's been stressing me is when my mom gave me this ridiculous speech: (paraphrased) **""A girl holds her entire family's honor; if one of your brothers does something [she means like, have sex or drink or smoke or move away from home or whatever] it's only HIS responsibility. When a girl does something, she taints her entire family's image. If someone sees you smoking - or whatever - and the word gets around, look how many people you're bringing down with you (referring to my brothers and parents)"".** Great. So now I have to sacrifice my own happiness so their ""image"" remains intact to the community? 

(she found out my 2nd oldest brother used to drink quite a bit and was pissed but definitely didn't kill him like she would me. **Irony**: this is the same brother that used to flip at his younger siblings because they weren't religious enough. Sevenish years ago he had a brain aneurysm because I listened to the black eyed peas....while he was drinking his face off and having casual sex. The hypocrisy burns)

I just feel so much unwanted pressure. I can't go out anywhere without my mom constantly blowing up my phone. It's annoying, embarrassing, and just....*leave me alone*. Especially when my brother can come and go as he pleases (using one of our family cars at his disposal, apparently) at any time of the day and it's no big deal. If I even bring this up she goes into that whole spiel about how **boys and girls are different we care about girls blah blah blah**.

I want to move out **SO. BAD.** I always figured I'd just suck it up till I was done my schooling (approx. 4-5 more years) but I don't see how that's even possible. I don't even know IF I'm going to last this Ramadan. 

I guess when it comes down to it, I want to move out for many reasons: many of them superficial and non-superficial:
I WANT to stay out past 9 without anybody killing my phone when I'm in the middle of dinner with my friends. I WANT to be able to leave the house in jeans and a t shirt and not be freaked out on. When I'm interested in a guy and he's interested in me, I'm tired of making up excuses as to why I can never hang out (particularly if he's older and I feel so juvenile being like ""yeah I can't go out to a bar at 8:30...no, I don't know why""). 
I'm tired of constantly being called to pray with some of my family members. I don't want to hear these female vs male roles speeches anymore. I want to travel. I want to (and am going to be) independent.

The only thing that's really keeping me sane is knowing I have five figures saved up (started saving in grade nine) that makes a nice safety net of sorts. But I'm the type that stresses over everything.

At times (especially when I'm a little bit tipsy) I just want to go up to my mom and say ""listen, I'm not a virgin. kick me out please."" When she used to accuse me of not praying or whatever, I used to (falsely) defend myself vehemently. Now I just kind of shrug whenever she accuses me of being ""far away from faith""

I know this all sounds so superficial but it's been bugging me so much. I want to leave SO BAD but I don't want to deal with the impeding shit storm. I just needed to get that off my chest.

**tl;dr: idk just read it**

We talk, he claims to be a UN worker (mfw everything I ever dreamed of in a man) he buys me more drinks, 'It's my birthday after all' he says.
Pretty tipsy, Seif says let's go for a walk, clear your head. Seems legit (imanidiot), follow him out. Has hip flask, more drinks, feeling SO good, SO happy to have been right about everything, SO wanted by such a good looking, kind and caring guy, maybe he could date me? boyfriend even?

I'll post my deconversion story in my original post a little later I've been meaning to get around to it for those who asked in that topic.

Anyway onto what made me want to facepalm my fucking head through a wall when I was in class today. Like I said in my other post we've been discussing Islam in my class for the past couple class sessions. Today the teacher brought up violence in Islam and how the Qur'an often preaches peace but also encourages violence at some points and he mentioned how the verses which promise Paradise for martyrs could be seen as an encouragement for suicide bombing. 

One of the Sunni girls in the back of the class had the ignorance and the audacity to raise her hand and say this.

""Excuse me professor? You know how you were talking about suicide bombers and violence? I think that's mainly the Shi'ites who do that. Sunnis wouldn't do that.""

HOLY F***ING HELL I wanted to put my head through a wall when she said that. WTF?! Thankfully the professor put her in her place. He said

""You're a Sunni aren't you?"" and just stopped there and the whole class laughed. Then he explained more.

""I know most people want to defend their beliefs and blame the other guys but you're wrong. These verses are right here in YOUR Qur'an it's not just Shi'ites. Look at Palestine and the Middle East there are Sunni and Shi'ite suicide bombers. You're just wrong in saying that.""

It was a little nicer than how I would have said it but he got his point across firmly. I would have explained 9/11 and how they were mainly Saudi with a smattering of Egyptians and an odd Jordanian/Lebanese and how Sunnis are fighting in Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nigeria, Somalia, etc.  I would have gone on to explain how since most Muslims are Sunni, that a majority of a suicide bombers by sheer probability are probably Sunni! I was so fucking dumbstruck that an adult in college with western education would say something so fucking stupid and wrong. This girl really had the audacity and the ignorance to make a statement like this?!

The way she tried to attribute violence in Islam and violent verses to Shi'ites make me think she's never opened a fucking newspaper let alone the Qur'an. If she had done either even once in her life she never would have said something so fucking stupid. I highly suspect I know more about Islam and the Qur'an than any of the Muslim females in my class. I studied that book fervently and researched many Islamic subjects because that's just the kind of person I am when it comes to philosophy and faith. These girls probably just throw on a hijab, fast when their parents tell them, and go to mosque without giving their beliefs a second thought or even a glance.

That just pissed me the fuck off today how someone could say something so stupid I was truly disturbed that a grown and western educated adult could really be that ignorant.

 I was literally insulted by her ignorance.

1346574523.0,35,self.exmuslim,z82d5,I'm unsure where to post this. But some of you might be able to relate. My father is abusive and I don't know what to do.,conflicted111,40,5,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/z82d5/im_unsure_where_to_post_this_but_some_of_you/,"This is really hard for me to write. Sorry for the length.

For the past twenty years of my life, my father has been abusive toward my mother and family. Physically and emotionally. But my mother always forgives him and crawls back to him. Every few months or so he will explode with anger and hit my mother. He did this about a month ago. I pushed him away from her, then he turned around and started hitting me. I hit him back. He thinks I am the scum of the world for defending my mother and myself. He approached me a few days later in my room and threatened me about it. He was about to hit me and forced me to say that I was wrong to do what I did. I had to, otherwise he would have lashed out.

He makes threats all the time and I'm scared of him. I'm scared to be around him. I'm really uncomfortable around him. Sometimes, things are fine. Other times, they are like this. I've had enough. 

I have been urging my mother to leave him, but she's in denial. She thinks that people have it worse and that my father's abuse is getting ""better"". She gets really really really angry at me whenever I bring it up. In response I get really angry because she is accepting the abuse. She says that he provides and that he is still my father at the end of the day. We have yelling matches about it and she ignores me or runs and complains to my father about it.

My parents turn everything against me. My mother says I have no respect and that I am a bad daughter who is unappreciative. She says I need to stop looking at the bad things about him because everyone has ""flaws"". Bashing your wife is not a personality flaw. Mind you, this is a man who prays five times a day and goes to the mosque every Friday, lol. My mother says stuff like ""at least he's not a drug abuser, a gambler"" as if it makes it any better.

My family will be going overseas soon for a few months, but my father will be staying. I will be expected to stay with my father in the house. He is aggressive and irrational. I haven't been speaking to him for the last month after he abused my mother and I. I want to stay with my grandmother (my mother's side) but apparently it's ""rude"" to not stay at home while my father is there, and he won't let me anyway. He wants to watch over me. And not in the way a protective and loving father would. 

It's also a HUGE taboo to get authorities or anyone like that involved. I've threatened my mother about it because I have audio evidence of him losing his shit, but I can't go through with it.

To top that off, I'm a broke student with no job or benefits who has nowhere to go. And it feels like my situation is not ""bad enough"" to get authorities involved. Not to mention the absolute shame that would arise from it if our huge circle of family and friends were to find out about it. It would be so embarrassing if people found out too because I do not want to be pitied. On the outside, my life seems perfect, but clearly it isn't.

This has made me hate Arab and Muslim men a lot. I know they aren't all like this, but the loathing is strong. The domestic violence in our communities is widespread. The anger and the disrespect they have for women is disgusting. I am a huge feminist, but in my own home I am a dog for Arab Muslim patriarchy.

My father was meant to go overseas with the rest of the family and I was to stay here by myself because of my studies, but he changed his mind and decided to stay after I defended my mother and myself. My mother is pretty much on his side. My mother is a very complicated woman and her mood changes every day. Some days she is very apologetic and the next she is defending him. I'm sick of her shit.

I'm not sure what to do. I'm a closet atheist and all I want to do is be free and live my life and go out and come home as I please without any restrictions or abuse from my parents. I haven't been focusing properly on my studies, I've been having problems in the friend and romance department so everything is shit for me. I'm tired. I'm considered attractive but I have a crippling body image disorder (was anorexic at one point in high school - I'm fine now) that affects my mood and mentality as well.

On the outside I'm holding up pretty well, on the inside I'm falling apart.

&gt;Abu Sirma said to Abu Sa'id al Khadri (Allah he pleased with him): 0 Abu Sa'id, did you hear Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) mentioning al-'azl? He said: Yes, and added: We went out with Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) on the expedition to the Bi'l-Mustaliq and **took captive some excellent Arab women; and we desired them, for we were suffering from the absence of our wives, (but at the same time) we also desired ransom for them. So we decided to have sexual intercourse with them but by observing 'azl** (Withdrawing the male sexual organ before emission of semen to avoid-conception). But we said: We are doing an act whereas Allah's Messenger is amongst us; **why not ask him? So we asked** Allah's Mes- senger (may peace be upon him), and **he said: It does not matter if you do not do it**, for every soul that is to be born up to the Day of Resurrection will be born.

It is not so powerful an entity that it deserves anger and hatred. It should be viewed as a part of human nature, a part of our evolution as a species, a sociological experiment, an anthropological experience.. but never a power in and of itself. 

It is man who created it, man who controls it, and it is ultimately up to man to eliminate it as an obsolete method of societal control.

Don't let Muslims or Islamic behavior control your emotions so harshly. When they come raging at us, be it on reddit or in real life, let's just communicate with them on a level that they'll understand. When that doesn't work, let's ignore them when they can't be reasoned with and discipline them when necessary (e.g. irrational responses to offenses, violence, etc), the same way we treat a classroom full of kindergartners. In reality, we're the grown ups.

No need for rage. They will either wake up in their own time or they'll be in for a big surprise in that last moment before death. I say a simple SMH will suffice.

I know that a lot of us are still angry about being in that deluded state or being forced into it. I'm honestly embarrassed about how deeply and strongly I believed, and I'll never get that time back. But it's ok, the past is the past. Today, we're free! Today is awesome.

I'm not sure exactly why but after questioning everything and thinking it through, I realised it was pretty much nonsense.

I'm only 15 and I'm seriously scared that maybe I'm so naive, i actually think i'm old enough to make big decisions like this. What If I'm wrong and just too arrogant to realise? It scares me. Although I really have lost all faith, I'm more worried about my family and how they'll see it. I may lose the most important people in my life and although they should love me enough to accept my views, we all know it's not that simple.

anyway, all of my family are fasting and I managed to get out of the first day because of school as my parents were quite lenient about it and said because It's hot and there's only like 2 days left of school, I can just miss the first few days of Ramadan, 'God will forgive me'- they say. Kinda cheeky but eh, they're still quite religious anyway.

The problem is, how do I get out of a whole month of not fasting?! I'm going to have to sneak food but I just feel guilty for some reason, just because I feel bad to be doing all this behind my parents back. It's odd  because I have done other things and not told them but this is much more serious in a sense that if they find out I've lost faith, I could lose a lot. It also makes me feel a little sad that I'm secretly outside the excitement of our good old traditions, I don't believe in the religious part of it all but I used to look forward to staying up till sehri in the mornings and then sleep in the day and just be with my family, struggling but having fun together in an odd way. It's what seperated me from my school life with my friends who have more ordinary lifestyles. Is there a way to still enjoy this 'festive' season of islam without having to actually believe in it? I don't exactly feel like fasting, however, because I never actually liked the part haha. Or will I soon get over it? i've only been athiest for 2 months so I'm still getting used to it but it is definitely a whole new world tbh, a bit more free in one way but kind of scary in another.",Question/Discussion,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,discussion,,True,t3_1i1e6k,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1i1e6k/ramadan_problems/,

I'm going to use this to let out some *bleurgh*, which I don't do or get to do as often as I should. yay men being trained to keep problems to themselves.

Just got off the phone with my aunt, she calls me once in a while to discuss Islam, and generally steer me back. Unfortunately it doesn't tend to work very well, e.g. today I made her re-read a part of the Qur'an she thought meant one thing, but actually means another (but can't blame her, lots of misinformation on the Islam Channel).

The *bleurgh* came out later. I've come out to everyone in my life, so I can focus on Stage 2 and the whole thing, but obviously that strained relations with my super religious family. 

I've just learned that my mom (very religious) has gone from crying everyday, to deep, deep depression. My dad (a stoic guy, smart but also religious in a personal way) just doesn't want to hear/talk/etc about me. But its my mom that gets me. She was bad when I left her and got *ahem* removed. Now she's just stopped talking to anyone, family or otherwise. 

This really isn't looking for advice, or cry for help or whatever, I've got bigger things to do...this is just to help me get it out of the system, catharsis I guess. I was prepared to potentially face the emotional turmoil of my mother disappearing/killing herself as she threatened to do a few times, so I've set myself up to be able to carry out what I want with Stage 2 and the rest of the movement regardless. It's just shit, y'know? It's alsl just fucking shite.

Lots of love, Improv :D

1) Forbidding me from eating with my left hand in islamic sunday school (I'm left handed....they literally hit my hand if I didn't use my right hand.) 

2) Asking my deen teacher in 9th grade in Jordan why muhammad was allowed 9 wives, why the very rules he created islamically didn't apply to himself...and getting a mediocre ""don't question god"" response. 

3)Not being allowed allowance because I never helped with the ""work"", never was allowed to help with the ""work"" because I was a girl. 

4)Being told from 12 y/o on that my virginity was like glass: once it's been broken, no one would be able to use it anymore, it's trash. (seriously?)

5)Being shipped off to the middle east at 11 yrs old for telling my parents I had a crush on a boy in class. They locked me in a horrifying house for 3 months while my brother saw the sites with my dad. I still have nightmares and panic attacks. 

6) Finding out at least 4 of my female relatives were rape survivors, all raped by other relatives of mine who continue to live full lives thanks to a sheikh deeming their rapes consentual fornication (incest....it was incest..). 

7) Witnessing the overall treatment of women in the faith, both by men and women (specifically female relatives of a woman's husband....the horrifying crimes they commit against each other made me sick)

Anddd finally........Watching my father research hymen reconstructive surgery while simultaneously urging my sister to forgive her rapist (my brother.....my convict alcoholic brother who can do no wrong in the eyes of islam ) and tell me that she will be outcast for being a whore if she didn't have the surgery. This was the moment I truly left Islam. 

My sister never agreed to the surgery. The family cast her out. My brother is still happily living with my parents on their dime with absolutely no care in the world. Everytime I see my mom she urges me to make peace with my ""loving brother"". Always lets me know he says hi...


EDIT: Another one. Ta3at al waldain (Obedience to parents). My dad got away with murder (his parents too) using that BS. Leave it to muslims to threaten hell if the youth turn out to be smarter than their parents.

noitulove: Every religion ""knows"" that they are right. This is one of the reasons why there is a need for secularism instead of theocracy.

turkeyfox: Well, every other religion ""knows"" that they are right. They think they're right, but in reality they're not. **Islam knows it's right without the quotes because we think we're right but also in reality we're right as well. So because reality and Islam match up there's no need for quotes.**


Another Resonse: Doctor_Yi
Nope. Sure, sounds like a double standard, but the fact is not everybody is entirely educated on Islam and so they might convert to some deviant sect. If we keep the populace extremely well educated on Islam, maybe it'd be alright, but the fact is lack of education leads to the formation of deviant sects of Islam and conversion to religions like Christianity.

Hello doc, listen i just DONT understand the logic here. rather than educating muslims its better that nobody else is allowed to preach anything here ? that too by use of force ?

Doctor_Yi: I'd prefer both. I know it seems unfair and a double standard for you, but apostasy and conversion to deviant religions is a symptom of a disease, and Muslims should both try to cure the cause as well as alleviating the symptoms, bandaging the wound. Fair? No, it might not be, but it's necessary. As Muslims we should do our best to enjoin what leads to heaven and forbid what leads to hell.

I'm thoroughly interested in women's rights, and stories about honor violence, forced marriage, female genital mutilation, wife beatings, etc. impact me in a big way.

I realize some of this behavior may be cultural in origin, and that's definitely a theme conveyed by some Muslims, who claim Islam to be perfect while Muslims to be imperfect. What I think some of those Muslims are saying is that there are problems with Quranic interpretation, or cultural differences that lead to violence against women, and the Quran itself does not justify these behaviors.

So, does the Muslim world have a women's rights problem? Are there huge geographic and/or cultural differences in the treatment of women? Are there liberals and moderates that tend to treat women better than conservatives? Do you think the Quran supports or discourages violence against women? Are Muslims who say that the Quran does not support these behaviors making excuses to separate these behaviors from the Quran and their faith? Or does the Quran itself justify it?

Please keep in mind I've never been out of the United States, and am just trying to gain a more informed and worldly perspective on these matters. Even if you only give me brief feedback, it's appreciated. I realized I asked alot of questions that may take a book to explore.

1360903636.0,35,self.exmuslim,18kc7f,Browsing the lactation subreddit (NSFW) gave me an interesting idea for Saudi Arabia and maybe the whole Muslim world.,JasonMacker,49,14,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/18kc7f/browsing_the_lactation_subreddit_nsfw_gave_me_an/,"Okay so, I was checking out (NSFW) /r/lactation and came up with this plan for Saudi Arabia. Here's how it works:

First, some background:

In Islam there is a concept known as [Radāʿ (رضاع)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rada_%28fiqh%29), and the way it works is that if you are breastfed by someone, then that person becomes [Mahram (محرم)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahram) to you. And this means they don't have to veil in front of you... okay see where I'm going with this?

We need to take every lactating woman in Saudi Arabia, take a sample from them, put it in a vat, mix it, and then make some droplets and invite every adult in Saudi Arabia to put a droplet on their tongue. This way, **everyone** in Saudi Arabia will be *mahram* to each other, meaning nobody in Saudi Arabia will have to veil!

And the side effect of this is that Saudis won't be able to marry each other. Well one solution is to simply encourage Saudis to marry Yemenis or Iraqis or Syrians or Gulf Arabs. Another solution would simply be to have the milk collection only be for each town in Saudi Arabia, meaning that each town would only get the milk from the lactating people in that town, so that everyone within a town is mahram with each other, but they would have to veil to go to a different town.

This is completely within the bounds of Islam, and makes perfect sense from a fiqh standpoint.

But why limit it to Saudi Arabia? Eventually we can develop a large enough infrastructure and bureaucracy to where we can do this to the *entire Muslim world*. Then, no Muslima will ever have to veil again. And if you want to enter a town, they have that town's collective breast milk waiting for you, which you have to drink to enter.

This is the way we can adapt Islam to the 21st century, with novel ideas like this.

And obviously of course the breast milk will be screened to make sure that no diseases or illness gets transmitted.

Though this only works if rada would apply if you drink it secondarily (i.e. not straight from the breast). If that's the case, this would make this much more difficult logistically, however it should be entirely feasible on smaller scales. And in fact there could be welcoming ceremonies for people to enter towns by having the women line up with their breasts ready to be sucked.

**Sahih International 16:103**

&gt;*And We certainly know that they say, ""It is only a human being who teaches the Prophet."" The tongue of the one they refer to is foreign, and this Qur'an is [in] a clear Arabic language.*

**Sahih International 26:193-195**

&gt;*The Trustworthy Spirit has brought it down. Upon your heart, [O Muhammad] - that you may be of the warners - In a clear Arabic language.*

It is a language spoken by desert dwellers in the 7th century, whose writings still exist to this day. This is not like finding fragments from ancient Mesopotamia and piecing together a language (which is remarkably possible). This is a language that can still be spoken fluently and learned. This is a language used by people who had no knowledge of the Internet, or germs, or satellites, or mobile phones, or evolution, or the speed of light, or the shape of the Milky Way Galaxy or the Higgs-Boson.

But still we are told repeatedly that we do not understand the Quran. Despite the knowledge many of us have gained in universities or through work, we do not possess the simple knowledge that Bedouins had 1400 years ago.  Despite the Quran telling us that the book is easy for ""men of understanding"" we cannot under any circumstances understand it without express teaching from a mullah. Despite 1400 years of scientific advancement, we are no longer closer to understanding the Quran than people who believe drinking camel urine can cure illness.

And laughably, the Quran says some wacky things we know are not true. That the sun sets in mud. That we can recite Surat Al-Falaq to save us from the evil of black magic or the evil eye. That there are seven heavens and the earth is flat. Or the moon was split in two. It gets even wackier if you include the hadith.

Despite all of this, they claim we cannot know anything unless we learn Fusha Arabic *and even then* our interpretations may be off. What sort of omnipotent Creator of the Entire Freaking Universe cannot make a book that would not be interpreted in multiple ways? 

Why would he make a book only in Arabic? The Chinese had a sophisticated culture, a flourishing civilization and were writing at the same time, why not send them a revelation? Or why not send a book so miraculous that whoever read it, would only see the words from their language, in a way that they would understand God's message perfectly? Allah supposedly sent down previous revelations: the Torah, Zabur, Injil, Scrolls of Abraham, Kitab of Yahya and the Scrolls of Moses. Does that mean it took Allah multiple times to finally get it right? Does he not learn from his mistakes? He couldn't just make the Torah incorruptible in the first place? Isn't he the All-Knower? Wouldn't he have knowledge of the future to know that his Perfect Revelations would be corrupted by people?

EDIT:

And if you don't understand the Quran, you're going to burn for eternity. No matter how nice and kind you are, you will roast in hellfire because you couldn't understand this ""perfect revelation.""

My brother and I are pretty close but haven't really talked in a while, with me being away at college. He usually always supported me, even if he didn't agree. He respected my decisions and choices and was still a good sport, never gave me shit for it. Except for today. 

I somehow built up the courage to share something that I haven't with anyone before. I started off asking questions if he ever questioned his belief/faith and why he was a Muslim. After a while of discussing things he became very frustrated that I was challenging him. He's usually open minded about things, except for religion. That's when he loses all rationality and becomes narrow minded. He told me to get to the point of why I had brought up this subject. After a few seconds of silence, I told him that I didn't have faith in religion anymore. He had this look of disgust on his face and quickly replied, ""Wth do you mean you don't believe in religion, are you fucking kidding me"". I tried explaining my side of things and the reasons of why so. He sat there quietly hearing what I had to say, but never listened. His exact words were, ""Are you sure you're not getting mind fucked by the shit you're reading"", this hurt me terribly. I tried to reason with him once more, but he wasn't having it. I dropped the subject and he basically demanded that I don't tell my parents of this crazy belief I had. After that I was too afraid of his reaction about coming out and saying that I didn't believe in God.

After that conversation I left and went out with my friends, to get my mind off of things. Coincidentally the topic of religion came up and even though my friends weren't that religious, it was clear that they truly believed in being a Muslim. I never told any of them about my beliefs and was a closet atheist. This just made me realize that I can never open up to them either.

I'm very sorry for being all over the place, my mind isn't at a rational place right now due to the emotions I'm feeling. I feel so freaking alone. I feel as if I was open about being an atheist, I would be treated as if I had a third eye. How did you guys cope with this? Any advice you can send my way?

(Now, I want to make it absolutely clear that I m NOT, in any way trying to insult females (muslim or exmuslim) who choose to wear a hijab. I believe every Human Being is free to wear anything they like).

Nevertheless, every time I would hear an imam talk about this topic in a mosque or see the way the hijab is enforced in Islamic countries, it gets me thinking. What does the hijab imply about men?

I know the principle behind a hijab is to protect a female’s modesty. Fine. But the REASONS religious leaders would give for this always shouted one thing at me: all men are perverts. 

This always makes me angry and it also brings up a couple of very interesting points. Firstly, are men soooo horny, that they will immediately fall into a hopelessly ecstatic and lustful trance the moment they see a woman’s hair? Or see a bare arm?

As a male, I take it as an insult when muslim leaders talk about it. They say that it is a woman’s responsibility to ensure that they do not provoke lustful thoughts in men’s minds. Are they implying men have no self-control? And wouldn’t it show a greater dedication to Allah if every man can look a woman full in the face, and be perfectly ok about it?  

Now, when I see a nice girl, I would often think, “wow, she looks good.” But that doesn’t imply a perverse mind. I don’t get an uncontrollable urge to have sex. It’s perfectly natural for guys to notice girls and vice versa.

And that brings up the second point. It’s PERFECTLY NATURAL. According to religion, everything natural is from god. Therefore, god has instilled such urges and attractions in us. BUT, god commands us to turn away from such things. 

Doesn’t that imply an imperfect god? First he creates such an attraction, but then he tells us to staunchly turn away from it. And he does not even have the power to correct his mistake.

And then the religious would argue, “but that is just a TEST. God is simply testing how well you can control yourself.” But, as I have outlined in my previous post, why oh why would the Creator of the universe, a being so powerful that he can control every event in creation, WANT to test us?

So, what do you guys think? I welcome any criticism to my thoughts. I genuinely enjoy listening to what people have to say. And if I have unintentionally insulted someone, I am very sorry, I m simply trying to share my thoughts.

Looking for advice [rant warning]",neorabbit,40,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1i9nah/ive_had_enough_of_this_crap_im_coming_out_and/,"I'm done with this shitty family and even shittier religion. I'm 24 years old and made it clear to never ever ""clean the room"" (code word for going though all your pockets and bags), or pressure me about religion. I get in trouble for cigarettes! I'm fucking 24 years old, I can smoke whatever the fuck I want. I requested multiple times to knock before entering my room and they don't seem to respect that idea. AM I going crazy here? Is this not standard practice and common courtesy in the world? 

I went out and changed door knob to one that I can lock to recently and I get flak for that. I get emotionally blackmailed for not fasting or praying. I simply cannot live in this toxic environment any longer. I have a completely different lifestyle that conflicts with living with my family (I smoke and drink once a week or every other week)

My situation is this. I JUST graduated from engineering at a major North American city so my job prospects are not too bad. However, I don't have a lot of money saved up... I'm guessing around $700 and it's depleting with a part time job that hardly gives shifts. So without going into details, I know of a place that I can crash where I'll have access to a fridge, a floor to sleep, internet, showers, microwave, and a coffeepot. I have this place until end of August and after that, I will probably have to find a friend's place to crash or a shelter unless I can afford an apartment by then. It's come to the point where this seems like a very good option than living at home. I plan on applying everyday by using my network to my full potential (btw, I'm open to relocating if you have an engineering job referral offer for me, PM me). My friend said he can hook me up with a part time job at a grocery store but I am going to remain cautiously optimistic with that

I'm going to tell them I am not a muslim and reject everything in Islam and as a result, cannot live in this household anymore. Pack all my bags and go after that. I'm aware I'm venting and ranting but this is something I've seriously thought about for a long time and I really think I'm going to bite the bullet and go through with this today.

The type of advice I'm looking for I guess is what to expect. I know it's all relative and unique experiences but are there certain traps I shouldn't fall under. Has anyone ever been in a similar situation? Anyone know how to eat healthy and cheap given my circumstances of only having access to a coffee mug, microwave, and fridge?

**EDIT:** I've read over every post and after having some time to myself and to cool off, I've decided to wait until after Ramadan, mostly because I at least respect them enough to not let this kind of drama get to them during this nonsense month even though it is clear they really don't respect me at all. I pretty much wake up early, make some breakfast, make a packed lunch, leave to campus or a library and spend the bulk of my day applying to jobs or keeping myself productively busy until I get sleepy and head home. Even been applying retail jobs (ugh) to at least start saving up some more money. I really don't know what I was thinking, this is the first summer I'm not working full-time. I guess a part of me really wanted to just enjoy this last bit of freedom I have in my youth before taking a career but it's really been shitty so far because of this household. 

I honestly think avoiding all confrontation is the only thing keeping me from losing my shit and leaving here. This is not a very comfortable lifestyle and it gets lonely. It feels like I'm in school again except lonelier but thankfully I have a few friends that love having me over from time to time. I've tried my best reasoning with them multiple times before this and I consider myself very level-headed but I've concluded there really is no getting through with them. Thank you all for your advice and support, I appreciate every bit of this. I admit, I did not think much about this community at first as I felt it was just another smug-atheist group but I can see why it is very necessary now.

(Sorry if this isn't the right sub)",Mussiethrw,34,0,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1f66rs/confused_by_my_muslim_boyfriend_unsure_of_the/,"I chose this subreddit because ideally, my bf will eventually be one of you guys. I love him and respect his faith, but it all just seems so hypocritical right now.

My boyfriend and I are both 21. I'm white, he's part Pakistani and is Muslim. My issue is this: right now I'm a secret from his dad. His dad is very strict and my boyfriend is not allowed to date. His father wants to arrange his marriage after he graduates college. My boyfriend has told his father many times that he does not want to be arranged and wants to do things ""his own way"". From my understanding, he's gotten grief over it from his family but the issue hasn't been pressed any further, since he still has a year or two left in school. 

I am okay with being a secret for now. His dad is footing the bill for his education, and I don't want to jeopardize that by making our relationship known. But I'm still not able to come to terms with it. First of all, my boyfriend's father did not initially marry in his culture. He married for love, to a fantastic Mexican woman, who I have met and totally adore. She knows about us and isn't going to tell her ex husband. After they divorced, he married within his race and religion and had a few more kids. 

I just don't get how his dad can be so passionate about the issue when he initially dated and married an ""unsuitable"" woman? Why does my boyfriend have to hide me and suffer through this family turmoil when his dad did the same thing? Maybe he just hopes for better for his son?

My boyfriend drinks, we have sex, and honestly he just doesn't seem that into Islam. He does fast at the appropriate times and doesn't eat pork, but this doesn't effect our relationship whatsoever. I'm hoping, and I realize that this is a bit selfish, that he eventually leaves the religion altogether. I don't want to raise our children Muslim. But I would do anything to make our future family happen. And if that is what it took, I would. 

Another thing about the arranged marriage, I just can't imagine him being ""suitable"" enough for a traditional Muslim woman. He doesn't adhere to all the principals he should and he's not fully Pakistani. From what I understand, that isn't what these girls' fathers are looking for. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's why I'm here. Just looking for insight into the situation.

I love him, he loves me, and we want to be together. There will be a day when he tells his dad and stepmom, but now isn't the time. I guess I'm ranting a bit now. But in the meantime, while I wait, how can I make him feel better about this? I know he hates keeping me a secret. I know he can't stand the idea of disappointing his family. But if his father hasn't disappointed his family by initially marrying his mother, he wouldn't even be here today! It just drives me nuts how his dad can preach all of this and push a lifestyle that he went against so many years ago as well. 

Tl;dr: I'm white, my boyfriend is a Muslim paki. We shouldn't be together according to his dad, but we are. How can I make this less painful and what do I need to know to make this work? Any advice or insight or personal experience will help.

I found a list of characteristics of sexual objectification, and I began trying to find examples within Islamic practice of the objectification of women.  Please feel free to contribute with more detailed analyses and examples!  

The first seven are enumerated by Martha Nussbaum and the last three by Rae Langton.

1. instrumentality: the treatment of a person as a tool for the objectifier's purposes;

2. denial of autonomy: the treatment of a person as lacking in autonomy and self-determination;

3. inertness: the treatment of a person as lacking in agency, and perhaps also in activity;

4. fungibility: the treatment of a person as interchangeable with other objects;

5. violability: the treatment of a person as lacking in boundary-integrity;

6. ownership: the treatment of a person as something that is owned by another (can be bought or sold);

7. denial of subjectivity: the treatment of a person as something whose experiences and feelings (if any) need not be taken into account.

8. reduction to body: the treatment of a person as identified with their body, or body parts;

9. reduction to appearance: the treatment of a person primarily in terms of how they look, or how they appear to the senses;

10. silencing: the treatment of a person as if they are silent, lacking the capacity to speak.

Now let's look at how the way that Islam is commonly practiced and understood actually involves all 10.

1. ""Your wives are a place of sowing of seed for you, so come to your place of cultivation however you wish and put forth [righteousness] for yourselves. And fear Allah and know that you will meet Him. And give good tidings to the believers"" (Qur'an 2:223).  Women are seen as fields, which are instruments for the pleasure of the men.  

2. Women are expected to obey their husbands.  They are not able to make their own decisions about their lives.

3. Women are expected to stay at home, confined to the private sphere while their husbands go out and deal with the public sphere.

4. Men are allowed to have multiple wives whom he is expected to treat equally.  He goes from wife to wife, having sex with them.  They are interchangeable to him.  

5. Martial rape does not exist according to Muslim jurists.  Husbands can have sex with their wives whenever they want, no matter how the woman feels. 

6. Men are seen as the guardians and maintainers of women, much the same as slaves or livestock.  

7. Male scholars, jurists and religious leaders have largely discounted the testimonies of women, telling them how they should feel.  

8. Women are primarily seen as reproducers and sex objects.  There is a complete lack of female opinions in mainstream Islam. 

9. Women are forced to obey strict Islamic dress codes.  Women who do not dress in a specific way are judged harshly and all sorts of assumptions are made about their level of faith.  

10. A woman's voice is considered awrah.  It is inappropriate for her to speak in many contexts. ",Question/Discussion,False,self,t5_2s7k2,False,discussion,,True,t3_18ubno,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/18ubno/islam_and_the_sexual_objectification_of_women/,

Also, this post is vague in order to protect the people involved in this situation.)

A 19-year-old Muslim girl who has been born and raised in the USA whose parents are from a Muslim-majority country is currently hiding out in my house because her family attempted to send her back to their home country to be forced into a marriage.

My family has known her family for many years and this girl and I used to attend a public school together when we were younger.  Her family approached her about getting married and initially accepted her refusal to marry a person she had never met and to be sent back to their home country, but later changed their tune and took her to the airport earlier today with a ticket for a flight to their home country.  She took advantage of her parents' lack of English skills and ""translated"" for them that an airport security person told her that only people who were boarding flights were allowed past a particular area of the airport, which got them to leave and gave her the opportunity to call me (off of a pay phone since her parents never allowed her to have a cell phone) to come and get her.  Thankfully, my own family is out of town right now and I have the house to myself and am able to let her stay here.  However, while my own family would never force anyone into a marriage or ship them off to another country like this, I would not have any of their support to get involved in another family's affairs in this way (especially since it's their daughter) and they would probably return this girl to her family.

What should my next steps be?  This girl was never allowed to get a driver's license, have a job, or attend college/university, so she does not have many resources to utilize.  Thankfully, since I've worked for organizations that aid young people in abusive households (or who are otherwise disadvantaged) before, I have access to a local women's shelter that I can get her into before my family returns home.  However, that won't provide a permanent solution and there are also the many dangers that will arise once her family finds out that she hasn't gone to their home country and likely files a missing person report.  Should I work on trying to file restraining orders against her family now while I try and figure out new living arrangements for her?  

I have only five days before my own family returns home, so I have to act very quickly.  She's safe for now, but I obviously have to help her into a situation that will provide her with long-term safety.  Knowing her family, her safety will be at very high risk once they find out that she's done this.

(I am posting this in this subreddit because it seems that a lot of you have had similar experiences and will probably be able to provide me with the type of help that I need.  Please, if you're going to try and insult me for being a Muslim or about my practice of Islam rather than help me get this girl to safety, do not bother responding.)

She hasn't emailed me since I wished her a happy birthday in July, and I just got this:
(Alena is my sister)

I debated weather I should write to you anymore or not. Your emails were hurtful and unbelievable. You said you don't feel safe and comfortable to see me because I told you that I will pin you down but did I do that ever to you ? I said that in a desperate attempt to stop you from what you did and to try to protect you. I know I can't protect you from yourself. The choices you have made has made life unbearable for me but the selfishness you have shown, you would not care.  Don't tell me that I am trying to make you feel guilty. You are not capable of feeling guilty. You can't be loyal to anyone. You betrayed the person who gave birth to you and raised you from when you couldn't do anything to when you could do what you did. May be you deserve what you got.
Religion is just an excuse for you because no religion would approve of your choices. You once said to me that anything is possible even that you could live forever. Well, you better wish to live for ever because you don't have much to look forward for later. 
I wish I could say that I don't care about you but that is not true. I can't help but to love you because I gave birth to you. I am sorry I trusted you too much and believed what you kept telling me and could not see what you were up to. I saw you as my best child, loving, caring, smart but it turned out as just an act. You acted until you did not have to. It is girls like you, that people are afraid to have daughters. You took away my ability to trust my children. Alena is trying hard but I just can't see her as any different then you. I see people caring for their children and all I could think of is what they will do to their parents when they are older. 
While I am alive, I will pray and wish for things to change and after that there won't be anyone to even do that for you. I will wait for you for the rest of my miserable life. If you ever see that you made a mistake or want to come back or to talk to me my doors are always going to be open and waiting for you.



I don't know how to feel. Guilty? I feel like an awful person. It's like I made the wrong choice. Like I know there's a reason I did all this, but it just feels so insignificant now.

I didn't know how else to get around the 10,000 character limit.

**TL;DR** I plan to give my parents the ‘all-tomato’ tonight that I am NOT a Muslim and they should not expect me to participate in any form of religious activities. I have no intention of praying. I do not want to deprive myself of water for 16 hours, especially in this weather. I’m worried about how they will react to this. 


**[UPDATE]** I have had the strangest day ever! But before I start explaining, I would like to thank everyone for their comments &amp; suggestions! I really appreciate it! I plan on replying to each comment so bear with me.

But first, back to Friday. So my dad came home a bit later (as I could hear him around the house). I was expecting him to barge in on me and say something, but nothing happened. A bit later, my mom came home. At this point, I had unlocked my door because one of my bros wanted to grab something from my room and I didn't bother locking the room after he left. I was programming for work-related stuff. My mom always makes tea for herself, my father and I. She came in and asked me if I wanted some, and I politely refused. I was pretty sure my dad had told my mom what had happened. And I was expecting her to bring up the subject, but she didn't.

I was expecting a big intervention but for the rest of the day nothing happened. My dad completely avoided me, giving me the silent treatment whenever I would step outside my room to grab a drink or talk to my brothers. My mom would occasionally ask me if I wanted to eat something, and I would tell her I wasn't really hungry. And that was that. Maghrib came and went, my brothers + dad went to the mosque. Nothing was asked of me. Taraweeh came and went, brothers + dad went to the mosque again. Nothing was asked of me. NOW, the whole time, I'm thinking of how to best break the news, tell my mom that I wasn't going to fast. I knew my mom was more understanding; she was the right person to go to. For the most part, I was procrastinating/stalling in my room, second-guessing myself and trying to decide if I wanted to back out. I was still on the computer but I was playing Spore (first time playing it) to distract myself and kind-of hoping that things would just work out on their own. 

Fast forward to 12 AM: I hear a lot of Ramadan talk, my parents nagging my brothers to go to sleep so that they could wake up early, etc. I told myself that I was running out of time. And then the STRANGEST thing happened. 

My mom came into my room and asked: ""So you're not fasting tomorrow, right?""
Me: *stunned* ""Yeah, I'm not.. I mean, no.. I'm not fasting.. not fasting..""
Mom: ""Okay, well I'm going to sleep so I left your dinner on the table (living room), eat it whenever you feel like it and go to sleep"" 
(Note: I hadn't eaten dinner that day)

A bit later, I had dinner, and talked with my brothers for a while (they were around). My dad was in the room but he didn't say anything. I was cracking jokes, mentioned some new video games, what-have-you, saying big brother kind-of things, just trying my best to be that amicable big bro, and my brothers would respond to me as they would before. I was glad to see that my brothers didn't treat me any differently, regardless of what had happened before. My disbelief doesn't change who I am, and I hope/wish my father realized that as he watched us.

So, I went back to my room, watched a bit of TV and went to bed. Woke up this morning, at 1 PM! I wasn't woken up for Suhur + Fajr prayer. The first thing I did was brush my teeth and then drink a giant glass of water. My dad is sleeping. My mom is in the kitchen, cooking. I walked through the kitchen to make sure things were still okay with my mom, she greeted me, etc. Things were still okay!!!

So long story short, I'm not fasting. They aren't expecting me to fast. I don't know what happened but I hope it was my mom who calmed my dad down and talked things through with him. I don't know whether they accept that I am an atheist or not but I don't plan on telling them now (don't want to add fuel to the fire). I also realized that maybe my parents didn't bring up a religious intervention because it hurt them to hear the things I would say and/or out of fear that I might convince my brothers or something. And isn't denial the first stage of grief? I would assume that Muslim parents would grieve the loss of their son's faith and it made me realize why they ignored the first time I came out. They were coping with that grief and subconsciously denying it. Pretended that I was still as a Muslim, etc.

Anyway, I do not know what the future holds. I don't know if my parents are completely accepting of my atheism or hoping (by some miracle) that I will get back on the path. But I am so far gone and there is no turning back. My whole reason for coming out was because I didn't want them to impose these superficial tasks on me, against my will. But now that they don't expect these things from me, I do not see a reason to make things worse by rubbing salt in their wounds. So I plan on leaving things the way they are for now. I look forward to the day when all my brothers see religion for what it truly is.

Lets go through the list one by one:

&gt; ~Islam forbade the Arabian practice of burying female infants alive and cursed those who have done so.

Probably the ONLY valid point I've ever heard made by apologetics. But then again, saying that you shouldn't kill babies isn't that much of a moral leap, even during in the 7th century. 

&gt; ~Adam and Eve both have equal blame in succumbing to Satan's temptation and eating from the forbidden tree, unlike in Judeo-Christian traditions where the blame is set on Eve for being the one to tempt Adam

What exactly does this have to do with women rights? You're merely stating the story of islamic creation myth of adam &amp; eve, and then compared it to the christian one, as if this implies Islam gives women rights somehow.

&gt; ~In Islam, Adam and Eve were both created from a single soul, unlike in Christianity where eve is created from Adam's rib

Not only are you definitely [wrong,](http://www.quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/004.055.548.html), I fail to see how stating the creation myth of adam &amp; eve implies that Islam gave women rights or equal rights. Can you please explain exactly how stating this creation myth means Islam gave women rights?

&gt; ~The first university in the Islamic world, the University of Al Karaouine was founded by a woman, Fatima al-Fihri, in 859 CE.

So? Just because a Muslim woman did great things, it means Islam gave women rights? There are a ton of Muslimahs today doing great things in various fields, does this mean Islam gave women rights or equal rights? Of course not. You're merely appealing at things culturally instead of referring to the actual primary sources of Islam itself, which is the Quran and Hadith. In that case, there are many Muslimahs who are also lesbians too who engage in homosexual acts, so does that mean Islam gave gays rights as well? There are many Muslims who drink, have sex out of wedlock, and do drugs, so does this mean Islam allows those things?

&gt; ~The Prophet's first wife Khadijah was a twice-divorced businesswoman who was exceedingly wealthy in her own right. Khadijah was the one to propose to the Prophet.

Khadijah became a business woman LOOOOOONG before he even married Muhammad, and LOOOOOOOOOOOOONGER even before Muhammad invented Islam in a cave. And again, how exactly does this imply that Islam gave women rights? So just because a Muslim woman does business, suddenly it translates into 'Islam gave women rights""? 

&gt; ~Aisha, the Prophet's third wife, was a renowned hadith scholar and military leaders.

How does aisha being a reknowned hadith scholar translates into Islam giving women rights? And no, Aisha didn't lead any armies, she was merely a figurehead. It was Zubair and Talha who lead her armies during the Battle of the Camel. And despite all this, Aisha is merely the exception, because everyone respected her due to her status as Umm ul-Mukmineen.

&gt; ~The Prophet once said: ""How splendid are the women of the Ansar; shame did not prevent them from becoming learned in their faith.

Again and again, how does this translate into ""Islam gave women rights?"" It is simply Muhammad praising women for learning more about their faith. That still doesn't change the fact that the Quran says men are superior to women, and that should cover their whole body, and that they are best to stay and guard the home while their men are out working. It doesn't change the fact that Muhammad thinks women are deficient in intelligence, and that he thinks 2 female witnesses are equal to a single man. Nor does it change the fact that Muhammad thinks a man should never be questioned on why he beats his wife.

&gt; ~Ibn Rushd (Averroes), the famous Islamic philosopher and Qadi (Islamic Judge), stated women to be equal to men in all respects and possessing equal capacities to shine in war and peace. He has cited women warriors among Greeks, Arabs and Africans.

Again and again, you keep appealing to culture instead of the primary sources. So what if some Muslim philosopher says that women are equal to men? Does he define what Islam is? Of course not. What defines Islam is the Quran and Hadiths, not Muslim scientists and philosophers.

&gt; ~Birth control is permissible in Islam as long as it's used with the women's permission

This is hardly anything special. People have been practicing coitus interuptus  and various other ways of birth control since the dawn of time, both men and women. Despite this, birth control is still [discouraged in Islam](http://www.quranexplorer.com/Hadith/English/Hadith/bukhari/009.093.506.html) 

&gt; ~Abortion is allowed in Islam as long as the embryo is less than 120 days in gestation

Can you give any dalils in the Quran or Hadith for this? As far as I know, none of the primary sources talked anything about abortion rights, and all rulings made by imams or sheikhs or muftis regarding the issue are merely ijtihad (personal opinion). And even then, abortions have been done by people long before Muhammad or Islam even existed.

&gt; ~Indonesia, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Turkey and Kyrgyzstan are Muslim majority countries and have all had elected female Heads of State

Again, appealing to culture instead of the primary sources of Islam. So what if these countries had female rulers? And even so, [there are a fcuk ton of women leaders today](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_government#Current_women_leaders_of_national_governments), all of them from different creeds and religions.)

&gt; ~In Islam, women are not punished for rape. According to the following hadith: During the time of Muhammad punishment was inflicted on the rapist on the solitary evidence of the woman who was raped by him. Wa'il ibn Hujr reports of an incident when a woman was raped. Later, when some people came by, she identified and accused the man of raping her. They seized him and brought him to Muhammad, who said to the woman, ""Go away, for God has forgiven you,"" but of the man who had raped her, he said, ""Stone him to death."" (Tirmidhi and Abu Dawud)

What, and you're implying that before Islam existed, woman in history were punished when they get raped? You act as if every single good thing that has ever happened in this world was started by Muhammad and his Islam somehow.  

And what's more, you've misunderstood the issue on why women get punished for rape in Islamic countries. Hey, here's a thought: Exactly how do you prove that a man has raped a woman? Let's say that the man has left no evidence at all that would link to him, what do you think will happen to the woman who reports the rape to the authorities in Islamic countries like Pakistan? Yes, the woman would have no evidence at all to convict the man, but unfortunately she will have evidence of her having sex (like her teared hymen), and she'll get convicted and punished for it. This is exactly what's happening in Pakistan where women who report rape cases are basically admitting they are having sex out of wedlock, and she'll get convicted and punished for it.

1376717378.0,31,self.exmuslim,1kjbhm,Should I really try to get out of my engagement?,DestinyCrusader,39,8,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1kjbhm/should_i_really_try_to_get_out_of_my_engagement/,"Hello everyone! Hope y'all are doing all right. I've made a few posts on here now and then so you may recognize me. For background purposes, I'm still financially dependent on my parents, am seventeen, and live in a family of total five siblings so whatever I do affects them. Also, I live in the U.S.

TL;DR on the bottom.

Anyway, I've been seeing a lot of posts here recently about marriage and what it's like to go into a marriage without that 100 percent trust and honesty. I've seen posts telling me ""sooner is better than later."" But the thing is, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to come out to my parents, as they'll believe I'll go to hell, and I can't do that to them. Nonetheless, I am at inner peace with myself for the first time because I finally know what I believe. A little too late though, because I've been engaged for four years.

At first it wasn't anything official. In fact, it still isn't official. I suppose it depends on your definition of official. Well, I haven't signed any papers yet (thank goodness) but the news is now very public, and my mom continues to go around telling friends and family about him. What's more, he's my cousin, and we both share the same grandfather which scares me for the future. He's only about two and a half years older than me, so at least there isn't a terribly long age gap. He has two older brothers, both were married in the same week (it was like a joint wedding) and I specially visited Pakistan alone to attend. On the last few days, the guy I'm marrying (Let's call him Mason, his real name starts with an M) put a ring on my finger in front of a lot of extended family at this afterparty sort of thing.

Need I go on? The thing is, it's really hard for me to get out of the engagement at this point. In no way am I being physically forced to go to Pakistan and marry him. However, a lot of people know and expect me to marry him. What makes it harder is that his family has continued to send me clothes, shoes, jewelry, etc for the past three years. I talk to his parents, brothers and their wives on the phone all the time. I can't really deny talking to them; my Mom would get suspicious, and they really are nice people. His mother is my dad's half-sister, and she has always been my favorite aunt. I guess, obviously, the main problem is that their Muslim. I don't want to live a Muslim lifestyle, and I don't want any kids of mine to live that life. And obviously there's no way we won't have kids, even if I managed to delay it for a while.

I've only very briefly talked to, er, Mason. He seems nice. Everyone around me tells me he thinks the same way I do. I know he's donated blood to his friend once. I've seen him kiss his mother's hand when he comes home. But I also feel like whenever he's forced to say Salam to me on the phone it's nothing, that he thinks I'm too young to understand anything right now and he's only ""appeasing me.""

Previously I made a post and was advised to try to talk to him. I pestered my mother for an e-mail address, but because of some tensions and the fact that I quit wearing my scarf my Mom hasn't let me talk to him yet. She says that I don't have to talk now, that Mason and I will figure things out ""later.""

I don't want this! I don't want to marry him. He said he liked that I covered my head. I guess that could mean he just liked my modesty, but it could also mean anything else. I also remember him telling me he liked girls that we shy, because at the time (two years ago, when I texted him for a very short time) I told him I was sort of shy. The thing is, I'm not shy anymore. In fact, I've grown up to be bold and confident, which I feel is a wonderful thing but no one in my family seems to appreciate. 

One thing that really bothers me as well is that one of the first things Mason asked me to do when I texted him back then was to hide my FB info, because it revealed too much. (Too much: My favorite movies, quotes, books, my profile picture, school, and I think that's it). When he said that, I was pretty happy because I was a naive little girl who finally got to experience a relationship. I liked the idea of being admired by one guy, and that he may not like other guys getting to know me.

But now it really worries me. What if he's controlling? And even if he turns out to be the nice person everyone claims he is, he'll still have Islamic notions in his head. Is there any way he won't restrict me? I probably won't be able to stay out at night with friends. He may restrict me going out at all. This is a guy who voluntary did the itkaaf, so yes he's pretty religious.

I'm going to try to organize my thoughts into pros and cons of marrying Mason.

**PROS:** (Or even, reasons why I may not be able to end this engagement)

* He seems like a good person, and his family is very caring. His mother is exceptionally sweet.
* Over the past years they've been sending me clothes (many of them expensive), shoes, jewelry, and call all the time to check up on me. If I end this engagement, how would I repay them?
* In general, they aren't as restricting with religion as my Dad is. They celebrate Valentine's Day (within the marriages, so I guess that lessens the impact) and are known to celebrate things very grandly.

**CONS:** (or reasons my marriage will most likely end in a disaster)

* He's a Muslim.
* Is there any way I could tell him? But then, I would be going into a marriage with a very big secret. That would create trust issues.
* Kids. Is there any way I won't have them? Honestly, I want to have kids in the future, but not with someone I barely know, and definitely not ones I would have to raise Muslim. Also, there is the concept of adoption. I really want to be able to adopt kid(s) when I'm married, and Islam can be complicated about that.
* He doesn't understand other sides of me either. I've been living in the U.S for a long time. I like anime, reading books. I write. I write *romance.* I have friends that are guys, friends I've hugged on occasion (My dad doesn't know.) I play video games all the time. To him, I'm still a child. These are things children do.
* My headscarf. It made me absolutely miserable, and taking it off has been the best thing I've ever done. My mom has already argued to me about it, and that even if she might let me go without it in school and college, I'll definitely be wearing it after. With him, there is no way he could understand why I wouldn't want to wear it.
* Rape culture. Strange point, I know, but I've been thinking about it recently because of something that happened in an anime, and I know he won't understand this either. I'm also very feminist, which probably won't work out too well.

So. I'm basically doomed, aren't I? There's no way this marriage can possibly end well. A lot of times I just wonder if I'm really choosing between problems right now if I refuse to marry him, or problems later if I agree with marrying him. Whatever I do, I can't see a way out of this. If I do refuse or end up finding a boyfriend or something (I plan to  have a go at dating in college) I'll be ruining my family's name. I worry about how the extended family will treat my mother. In the past, my Dad's side of the family has brought her nothing but pain. Over the years she's become too sensitive. She found my rejection of the hijab a ""way of repaying her"" for everything she's done for us. But I can't tell her why I don't want to marry him, can I?

I also worry about my siblings. I have a soon-to-be-turning nine-year-old sister who they could easily take back to Pakistan to avoid anything that happens or might happen with me. I have a brother who's six, and then another sister who is five. I want them to have wonderful lives. I love them, and I don't want my actions to affect them negatively.

I worry so much. Lately it's all I can think about. Is there any way I can break out of this engagement? What can I do? Like I said, I've been reading posts about how it can be unfair to the other person if I go into the marriage and Mason knows nothing. I know his e-mail, should I send him a message in secret?

I'm also trying to lay low for now, since I'm a senior in high school and I recently took off my head-scarf. I don't want my parents suddenly sending me back to Pakistan to marry me (my dad has threatened this.) But I also don't want to drag this out any longer than possible and ruin Mason's chances of finding another person to marry. I feel like the weight of the world is on my shoulders, and that there's nothing I can do. I'm Atlas, and if I move too far towards one direction the whole sky may collapse on everyone else. What do I do? Is it really worth it to ruin my family's relations and my siblings lives so that *I* may have a good life?

**TL;DR:**
The engagement is very public, he's a close cousin so there may be problems with having sex (ugh, can't think about it) he's close to a devout Muslim. Is it worth ruining family relationships and my siblings lives and my mother's weak health to break out of this engagement? Or should I just go with it for the sake of saving myself trouble now? Or will this just be an even bigger problem later?

We have been married for five years and ahmadallah our relationship is good. Recently though I have discovered he has some pretty serious vices. I believe he is addicted to porn and gambling. I have caught him several times watching it on the computer or taking his iPad to the bathroom for long periods of time. He usually just screams at me to leave when I catch him. It's not like I don't try my hardest to satisfy him but it never seems to be enough to get him to quit. The gambling is another story all together. He does it openly around me. Mostly online poker and sports betting. It use to be a mild annoyance but recently it has become more serious. He took a trip recently to Las Vegas for a business convention. I was reluctant to let him go, but he promised he wouldn't gamble and there really wasn't anything I could do about it. He called me at 3am asking me to wire him a thousand dollars. When he got back he refused to talk about it, and said since he's the only one who works he can spend the money like he wants.

It's been a month since her death. I've never been this furious ever in my life but I'm calm. I despise God. I feel like I'm making a mistake.

I know its been a month, but I can't come to myself to ever feel that she's gone. That I can't ever talk to her, share with her things that I did, get to know her opinion...etc. 

Each day I wake up, my self conscious mind reminds me that I must dress up to get to the hospital to meet her- I hate that. While my conscious mind keeps going over and over of each and every single word I've spoken to her; I could have said it in a better way, always.

She was the only person, the mother, the only friend I care about in my life. I cared for her like no other. I never cared about anyone else. She's gone now and I feel I'm gone too from this 'world'. I absolutely have zero objectives in life without her. All our promises to each other are gone.

I did and they responded with a video they had someone make.  I responded to that in email.

The video in question: 
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVDCJL3pVGI&amp;list=UUcsGuL14ppgSQZVAxHCHPLA

Context:  I've been on here and reddit for a while, but I rarely (as can be seem from my comments) have anything that I feel is worth contributing to an on going discussion.  However I thought this might find a home here.  I was talking to someone on omegle, and I revealed that I am ex-muslim (closeted).  She had this guy (who some of you have seen) make a video.  I'll paste in the original email and my reply so you have the ""full story.""  Also, I'm quite aware that ""she"" may just be this guy.

My Email:
-------------------------
You wanted to know my ""story"" about why I'm not muslim anymore.  I'll be brief cause I don't want to type because I'm not sure how fruitful this will be.

I will start by saying I was raised as a muslim.  My parents we're always emphasizing praying and fasting.  Like most, I went through periods of low faith and high faith.  ""Low"" would be that I would be negligent in my prayers but feel bad about it.  ""High"" would be to praying five times a day.  All of this was because I accepted Islam without question.

I read the Quran, and all I got from it was that Allah is most forgiving, so I never understood why some muslims are so angry all the time, or always preach fear and hell.  This was not my experience.

Then as I got older, I learned more about the real world.  I learned that evolution really did happen, contrary to what I had been taught.  I just figured that adam and eve must have been figurative, and that the muslims who are denying evolution don't understand this.  It went like this for a while.  I started trying to reconcile new information I was learning, with what I had been taught in islam.

It got more and more uncomfortable as I found more and more things in islam I didn't agree with morally.  I learned more about morality and the source of it.  By then I had learned the importance of evidence for claims.  I slowly started to realize, the ""evidence"" for the authenticity for islam really just amounted to ""because the quran says so, and the quran is from god""  It took me a while to recognize the circular nature of that argument, but when I did, it opened up another problem.  Let's say the quran really did come from god?  How could we, as humans tell?  How could Muhammad?  What criteria would we use to distinguish a quran from god, and a quran from some other being who is not god? So then the following though came to me.  What if god's test isn't ""Do you follow quran""  What if his test is ""Do you follow what you know to be right and wrong, or do you listen to some book?""  What is if the sinners are the ones who blindly follow and kill people for trivial transgressions? 

At that point, my belief in islam was gone, but I still believed, in god, until that too went away for the same reason:  I had no good reason to think it is true.

Hello stranger,
Please forgive me for the long delay in responding. I've been having a very hard time recently, so I haven't been able to spend a lot of time online. basically to cut a long story short, my mother has been sick and i have been nursing her. :(
I was speaking to someone about your story because it hasn't once left my mind since we spoke. He prepared a video for you in response to some of the issues you raised. Please note, that this is in NO-way an attempt at ""shoving opinions down your throat"". I would love to hear your response. so yeah, please watch and let me know.

PS please send your response to me and not the guy himself.
 It would be great to hear from you.

Take care. :)

Just look at [insert religion here]""

It goes like this: so you're in an online discussion about a negative facet on Islam, like it's tendency for hate and violence for instance, but then some assclown comes in and says BUT ITS NOT JUST ISLAM, CHRISTIANITY IS BAD TOO JUST LOOK AT THE CRUSADES HERP DERP. No fucking shit sherlock. All religions are bad, but we're talking about Islam now, so it'd be great if you pull your libertard head out of your own ass for 5 goddamn minutes and try to stay on point. 

Also consider this, imagine you're in a discussion about how terrible Christianity is, like how Christians are banning gay marriage, abortions, etc. and then suddenly I come in and say BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHRISTIANITY LOL ALL OTHER RELIGIONS ARE BAD, JUST LOOK AT ISLAM THEY FLEW PLANES INTO BUILDINGS. You wouldn't like that shit wouldn't you? So please goddamn stop this bullshit.

&gt; ""Most Muslims are peaceful, you can't blame honor killings/suicide bombing/terrorism on Islam!""

Sure most of them are peaceful. But then again most Christians are peaceful too. In fact, the lack of any news of Christians bombing or beheading other people in the name of Christianity seems to imply that Christians are even more peaceful compared to Muslims in general. But then again it didn't stop you from blaming Christianity whenever cunts like The Westboro Baptists picket fences, did it? It didn't stop you from blaming Christianity every time you hear abortion clinics being bombed, or some gay kid being killed in a gay rehab camp. Because you damn well know that even though most Christians are peaceful, all these terrible acts of inhumane cruelty had something to do with sentiments within Christianity itself. 

And the same thing is also true in Islam. Just because most Muslims are peaceful, doesn't mean you can just wave away all the terrorists and the acid throwers and suicide bombers and the child brides and pretend those things have nothing to do with Islam. Because they sure do.

I'm a 43-year old (mostly)white male from various states in the western US. I was born to a Mormon father who left the church before I was even out of diapers.

We moved around a lot, so my religious upbringing is a little odd. We dabbled in Catholicism (very briefly) before moving to the Episcopalian church (which is kinda like Catholicism, but with half the kneeling and guilt trips). After that, I did some brief time with the Southern Baptists of New Mexico, then moved to the Northwest for some old-fashioned ""the Bible is 100% the WORD OF GOD!"" non-denominational churches.

I've been baptized three times and confirmed once. I studied the Bible heavily as a teen, and even gave some guest Sermons when I was 19 and 20. I was planning on becoming a Pastor, but then...the more I read the Bible, the less I believed it.

I became an atheist around 1991 or so and never looked back.  I've asked a lot of questions of the ex-Muslims in this sub, and will be returning the favor for rest of the afternoon today while I work on my comics.  Ask me anything! And thanks! :)

She's really busy, and will be doing something asap on reddit. I've asked her to do an AMA style post, so you guys can ask her questions and vice versa.

Once her paper is up, we will have some other sources. Until then, I did get some info off her yesterday. Interesting things that really made me think.

Basic things she says:

* Pre-Islamic Arabia was mostly matrilineal tribes, i.e. WOMEN and their own tribes got the kids.
* Patrilineal tribes started popping up through trade with Christian nations, which were strongly patrilineal
* Women would have complete control over who the father was, and polygamous relationship were not at all the norm

Some proofs from Islam itself:

* Muhammad married Khadija, and stayed monogamous to her until she was 60+ and died. It was only after her death that he sent two invitations for marriage to two separate women.  This is because Khadija came from a matrilineal tribe, hence why she owned her own business, property, etc. 

* Khadija inherited her father's business, and made it larger and more profitable. Other men asked for her to marry then, and she refused them. Muhammad was dependent on Khadija, financially (she paid him). The guy was her employee.

* There are hadiths which talk about the Ansari women being too ""free"", and the Meccans came to the Prophet complaining about this (I think it was Umar al-Khattab specifically). This was because Medina's tribes were matrilineal, and Ansari women were seen as having the ""upper hand"". The Meccan men didn't like that their own wives were copying the Ansari women.

* She mentioned that Muhammad himself took the name of his mother's tribe, and that there was a hadith saying the Quraysh children would mock him for this.

* Something I realised... Muhammad was sent to a wet nurse (Halima?), because women took care of the children of others. This is a pretty strong symbol of matrilineal tribes too. **This is something I realised, not something she said. But being told below this is really weak proof**

I am locked out of my research lab by mistake and so I stumble in to the community study area.  It's early, so no one is really around, only two guys, they are Saudi guys who I know well enough, as we were all MSA officers at the uni back when I was... well... a Muslim.  I can see through the window they are talking to each other in Arabic and laughing and smiling and having a good time.  Saudi dudes around here are typically really boisterous and never shut up even when others are trying to study and so I figure like normal if I go in, I'll have to listen to their bullshit conversation.  But I'm out of options so I reluctantly go in to study.


The moment I walk in, both the guys get super quiet.  The conversation is over.  One of the guys is a few years younger than me, and he was actually one of my students in a class that I TAd a couple years ago.  They are silent and won't look at me, and I can tell they are uncomfortable.  Within about 2 minutes they just pack up politely and leave.  


I know it's not my fault.  But sometimes I can't help to feel hurt by this and in an odd way, shamed.  Maybe because when I walked in the building this morning right behind me was a girl from Saudi who used to be friends with me.  Since I stopped wearing hijab she will not look me in the eye and if she sees me she just hangs her head and walks in the other direction.  Just me being in the same building as her appears to make her uncomfortable.  


I wonder what they think and feel when they do this.  Are they afraid I will influence them?  Or they just hate me now?  ",,False,self,t5_2s7k2,1349276995.0,,,True,t3_10vlpv,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/10vlpv/disappearing_act/,

Female students in Iran have been barred from 
more than 70 university degree courses in an 
officially-approved act of sex-discrimination which 
critics say is aimed at defeating the fight for equal 
women's rights. x worldnews",ihedenius,33,2,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/ykscf/anger_as_iran_bans_women_from_universities_female/,"&gt;By Robert Tait

&gt;3:17PM BST 20 Aug 2012

&gt; In a move that has prompted a demand for a UN investigation by Iran's most celebrated human rights campaigner, the Nobel laureate Shirin Ebadi, 36 universities have announced that 77 BA and BSc courses in the coming academic year will be ""single gender"" and effectively exclusive to men. 


&gt; It follows years in which Iranian women students have outperformed men, a trend at odds with the traditional male-dominated outlook of the country's religious leaders. Women outnumbered men by three to two in passing this year's university entrance exam. 


&gt; Senior clerics in Iran's theocratic regime have become concerned about the social side-effects of rising educational standards among women, including declining birth and marriage rates.

&gt;Under the new policy, women undergraduates will be excluded from a broad range of studies in some of the country's leading institutions, including English literature, English translation, hotel management, archaeology, nuclear physics, computer science, electrical engineering, industrial engineering and business management. 


&gt; The Oil Industry University, which has several campuses across the country, says it will no longer accept female students at all, citing a lack of employer demand. Isfahan University provided a similar rationale for excluding women from its mining engineering degree, claiming 98% of female graduates ended up jobless. 


&gt; Writing to Ban Ki Moon, the UN secretary general, and Navi Pillay, the high commissioner for human rights, Mrs Ebadi, a human rights lawyer exiled in the UK, said the real agenda was to reduce the proportion of female students to below 50% – from around 65% at present – thereby weakening the Iranian feminist movement in its campaign against discriminatory Islamic laws. 


&gt; ""[It] is part of the recent policy of the Islamic Republic, which tries to return women to the private domain inside the home as it cannot tolerate their passionate presence in the public arena,"" says the letter, which was also sent to Ahmad Shaheed, the UN's special rapporteur for human rights in Iran. ""The aim is that women will give up their opposition and demands for their own rights."" 


&gt; The new policy has also been criticised by Iranian parliamentarians, who summoned the deputy science and higher education minister to explain. 


&gt; However, the science and higher education minister, Kamran Daneshjoo, dismissed the controversy, saying that 90% of degrees remain open to both sexes and that single-gender courses were needed to create ""balance"". 


&gt; Iran has highest ratio of female to male undergraduates in the world, according to UNESCO. Female students have become prominent in traditionally male-dominated courses like applied physics and some engineering disciplines. 


&gt; Sociologists have credited women's growing academic success to the increased willingness of religiously-conservative families to send their daughters to university after the 1979 Islamic revolution. The relative decline in the male student population has been attributed to the desire of young Iranian men to ""get rich quick"" without going to university.

I'm only four suras in and all I keep reading is ""the disbelievers will go straight to hell,"" ""don't be friends with the disbelievers,"" etc. Example:

""The disbelievers will be fuel for the Fire, just as Pharaoh’s people and their predecessors denied Our revelations, and God punished them for their sins: God is severe in punishing. [Prophet] say to the disbelievers, ‘You will be defeated and driven together in Hell, a foul resting place.'"" – 3:10-12

""If anyone seeks a religion other than [islam] complete devotion to God, it will not be accepted from him: he will be one of the losers in the hereafter."" – 3:85 

""Those who, after believing, then disbelieve and increase in their disbelief, will not have their repentance accepted. They are the ones who have gone [far] astray: those who disbelieve and die disbelievers will not be saved even if they offer enough gold to fill the entire earth.  Agonizing torment is in store for them, and there will be no one to help them."" – 3:90-92

""We shall send those who reject Our revelations to the Fire. When their skins have burned away, We shall replace them with new ones so that they may continue to feel the pain: God is mighty and wise."" – 4:56

I mean, come on. I was actually looking forward to the sura titled ""Women,"" but it turns out only the first few verses were actually about women's rights in Islam. The rest turned out to be the same crap over and over again. Is it all just this? I mean, the whole second sura used a bunch of biblical stories that tried to say the same thing. And I get that, but it's getting a little old now. It's so prevalent that it almost feels like Islam doesn't even have its own ideology anymore.

&gt;He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man who has done this action and I adjure him by my right to him that he should stand up. Jumping over the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up.

&gt;He sat before the Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) and said: Apostle of Allah! I am her master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not abandon her habit. ***I have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you.*** ***So I took a dagger, put it on her belly and pressed it till I killed her.***

Hey guys,

They are some people from r/Islam complaining about us removing threads. I think it's just the spam filter, but for future reference, don't remove anything (unless it's utter nonsense). Let the Muslims post in our subreddit and we'll disarm their fallacious arguments with logic and rational discussion. We've got nothing to hide.
If we develop a reputation for being close-minded, then all of this is in vain. I need the world to understand that Islam is nonsense because it violates rationality, and not because of some personal or subjective vendetta against it.

I just have to get this off my chest. Twice a year the eid rolls around and twice a year I get so extremely depressed I don't feel like getting out of bed. But I have to I have to put on a face and help my mom serve coffee and mamoul to all of our guest. The eid has been horrible for me ever since my dad passed five years ago. He was without a doubt the greatest person in my life. I still removed it every eid he would come in would come and wake me my mom and my two younger siblings up at 7 am and tell us to hurry up and get dressed. He would then take us out for breakfast and we would laugh and have a great time, then he would take us to six flags and play with us and we would have a blast, later on in the evening we would go out to the toy store and he would all get to pick one thing (I would always get something extra since I was the oldest), we would then go out to dinner and then go home exhausted. It was literally something I looked forward to all year round and I loved fasting in Ramadan and praying because I knew it would make my dad and god happy. My dad was the greatest man I knew he moved to America from Palestine when he was 14 and dropped out of school and started working right away. He held odd jobs and was a salesman saving every penny and living in a small apartment with 6 of his cousins. When he was 17 he had saved up enough money to get married and married my mom moved her out here. At 18 he started his first business it failed at 19 he tried again around the time my mom was pregnant with me. He started off selling junk watches and costume jewelry in a five year span he turned it into a booming high end jewelry store. My dad was never extremely religious he was a moderate my mom was more religious than him. Even though I am a girl I was never treated different than my younger brothers even a little better sometimes. I could always talk to him about anything. I remember one time I told him a boy at school told me he likes me, he just looked at me and said of course you should get used to it what's not to like just remember habibti boys here have different morals and have a different culture than us and while its ok to have friends just be careful and use your judgement like we taught you. I didn't think much of it at the time although I know have grown to realize that was the best response he could have given. All this changed when I was 13 he got killed in a robbery he didn't even resist they just came in shot him and two other employees and robbed the place, they were later caught it was two junkies high on whatever that ruined my life. My mom was a reck I was a mess the most stable important person in my life was gone. My mom didn't talk for a month she was like a ghost I had no one to talk to and remover being extremely angry blaming myself maybe if I prayed more god wouldn't punish me maybe if I read more Quran he would have watched over my dad, although he never told me to do any of that. That anger than got directed toward god and made me angry and bitter. I didn't want to talk or speak to anyone I stopped praying I stopped fasting I stopped everything I my blood would boil anytime someone mentioned god in a positive light. How could they worship someone so cruel someone who did nothing but help people and spread love. My uncles took over my dads business and ran it into the ground in less than a year. My mom decided America was to dangerous for us and moved us back to Palestine much to my disappointment but she was so fragile I didn't want to argue much. Once we got here everything changed my uncle who I never met decided to marry my mom and take her as a second wife. He already had 6 kids, and me and my brothers were never treated as family. His first wife and my mom would always bicker and my step brothers who were 17 and 16 at the time I was 14 would always act inappropriately towards me. We were put into the public school system even though our arabic was weak and we were forced to live by a strict Islamic code. My uncle ( I refuse to call him anything else) forced me to wear a hijab within the first two weeks I was there and put my youngest brother in Islamic classes with his sons to become a hafiz. Now here I am 18 no freedom living in a shack of a house in a third world country no one to talk to because anyone you confined in here cousins, aunts, gossip behind your back. I remember when I was 17 I met a boy at random I was walking home from school and he was across the street some driver nearly ran him over and he screamed something in English at the driver and I laughed he saw me and asked me where I was from and I told him America and he said him too we talked for all of 30 seconds. When I got home my cousin (step sister) asked me what happened and I told her. At 11 at night my uncle comes bursting through my door when I was asleep and proceeds to beat me with his sandals calling me a whore he then yanked my mom out the room when she tried to consolidate me and forbid me to go to school for two weeks. So now there talking about marrying me off to one of my cousins since he wants to go to America to work, he seems like a nice guy but I don't want it I might only do it to get out of this hell hole. Anyway dad I love you and I miss you and today of all days I wish sitting next to you watching a movie with you telling me how special I am and how I am gift because walahi when you said it I believed you and I miss you so damn much and I know you wouldn't have let none of this happen.

This is my first post on this website. I've been referred to this website a long time a go by someone very close to me. Its taken me a while to actually write anything on it because I didn't really know if I was an ex-muslim. I mean, I've been going to a Muslim private school my whole life and I've always had doubts, but I pushed them aside usually by telling myself ""people are just misinterpreting this, that's not what god meant"" or ""as long as you're a good person, none of this matters"" but this past year I attended college and things really changed, or picked up. 
I've never had the freedom to explore my thoughts and do all the things I've always wanted to. I drank, went to parties, and basically lived a normal college life while still living at home. Things got really really complicated. They got even more complicated when I met this amazing guy who I fell in love with. He happened to be a non-Muslim, but that was never really an issue with me. I believe that if you're lucky enough to fall in love with someone, their religion should be the last thing on your mind. 
Anyway, I've always been the kind of person that likes to take risks but a few months ago, it finally came to bite me in the ass. My boyfriend came over while my parents were at work and we were hanging out in my bedroom. My parents came home for lunch a little earlier than expected and they caught my boyfriend in his underwear in my closet. It was probably the most traumatizing experience of my entire life. I still have nightmares about it and if I stay in my closet for too long I get anxiety attacks. 
I feel so torn all the time now. I feel like my parents want me to be somebody I'm not and my boyfriend wants me to realize things that I'm not ready to. And I'm scared that if I talk about my fears too much with my boyfriend, he'll worry and it'll cause a bunch of problems in our relationship. I know he worries about me and it really kills me to see him so stressed. I don't know what to do or who to talk to because I feel like no one gets it. 
Is it so wrong to want both your parents and your boyfriend? I want to find a balance but I'm afraid there isn't one. I'm afraid I'll lose both people because I'll never be able to do what they want me to. My parents will never accept that I don't believe in the things they do, but financially I am still sorta dependent on them. I have 2 more years of college left to go. I got a job over the summer and that allowed me to buy my own phone because they had a family locator app on their line that they frequently used. (They were tracking me via GPS). 
Now I'm afraid they'll install a GPS thing in my car. Yes, they really are that psycho. We don't really talk and we've never had the best relationship so I don't think there's a way I can confront them about these issues. I feel so trapped and a part of me is telling me to drop everything and run. I don't know where I'll go or if I'll have a job, but then I wouldn't have to be stuck in this situation.

Anyway, I'll start. Feel free to think post and go off about anything this week that you were just like ""ugh"" about. Remember, you don't have to wait to rant til Sunday, especially when something is very in the heat of the moment. This is more about the little things that happen that we just shut away.

I'll start: I hate being a curvy female among muslims. You'll notice this hypocrisy all the fucking time, where if a girl is very slender and doesn't have much going on, she won't be browbeated for what she's wearing, no matter her age or actual level of growth.
I fucking hate being punished for having large boobs. I cannot wear a god damn sweatshirt all the time. I'm not going to fucking put a scarf around my next any time someone accidently walks in. I have to wear sweaters with scarfs *in my own home (because apparently fathers, brothers, and uncles need to be taken care of too*) and constantly hide and layer on my already large top half.
Why didn't your precious Allah just make all boobs small and unappealing so they wouldn't draw attention? I lost a ton of weight (which is why I hear less about my covering my butt, fucking Muslims.) and my cup has not dropped. Every time they say something about how what I'm wearing is too low cut (they're not low cut, I dress *very* modestly by my own choice) I honestly wanna run them into a wall.

",Obidies,31,1,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/15vz5k/teacher_thinks_im_likely_to_turn_away_from_islam/,"I have this Math teacher. He is a good person and a great teacher. Anyway, this one time in class, he came to hear from his other students that they think my English is better than anyone else they know (thank Cthulhu for dirt cheap books). So, my teacher approached me, and proceeded to tell me how his daughter is studying the abridged works of Shakespeare in school and how wrong it is that kids should study the works of Shakespeare in school because of their ages (I proceed to feign horror when appropriate). He then says ""You should take care, those with good English tend to turn away from Islam."" I sit there, digesting what he just said, because that statement came off as very anti-education to me. He then proceeds to tell me to read the Quran. i tell him I've read the Arabic and the translated version, he tells me to read them again.
I leave class finding it funny how I have already ""turned away"" from Islam.

This other time, we're talking about chess in class and he comes to know that I am a serious chess player. He then says that ""Instead of wasting your time on chess, you should read the Quran."" So, playing a mentally stimulating game that I like is a waste of time, but reading a book that is not even in a language that I can understand isn't?  I, not wanting to be disrespectful, replied in the affirmative. 

Another time in class, he sees that I have Stephen Hawking's ""Black Holes and Baby Universes"" in my hand, along with my Math books. He proceeds to, you guessed it, tell me to read the Quran. To be fair to him, he starts like this ""You may not like what I am about to say, but  I am your teacher and it is my responsibility. Keep reading these books but.......""


What I am getting at is that my teacher basically implied (knowingly or unknowingly) that a good education and intellectual pursuits will lead you astray from Islam. It's not like he goes around telling everyone to read the Quran, as far as I know, he has only done that with me. I can only conclude that he thinks I am more likely to leave Islam. 

While I did not apostatize due to cold hard evidence (I hadn't been exposed to any), my apostasy lead me to value education even more. Had I not been an avid book reader from the very start, it is extremely probable that I would still be a fundamentalist, or a different person. Increasing the standard and accessibility of education will increase the probability that the young of this country of will grow up to be productive, questioning members of society, not extremists who contribute nothing of worth to society. Sadly, that is not happening anytime soon. I only know one person who accepts evolution, and the students here have an aversion to the Sciences. This is one of the reasons why individuals who have been raised in liberal societies and have had the advantage of a superior, secular education, yet are blind, zealous believers, irritate me.

We all want to free people from religion if it's corrupting them or hurting them, so let's get right to how to approach religious discussions with the intention of initiating a change in their religious stance. A lot of it is pretty intuitive but I think we need to go over the best way to do it. Please, feel free to comment away and correct my technique and share links or internal knowledge with each other. Together, we may develop the best technique in this holy month of Ramadan.

Ground rules:

* Make sure you're always respectful. You want to keep the discussion going. Don't let them storm out because of a slip of tongue.
* Make sure they stay on topic. Don't let them wuss out and enter a different topic that enables them to justify their beliefs
* Let them talk. Don't interrupt them- let them talk because that's a better way to enable them to think about what they're saying.
* Use their weapons against them: We all know how much Muslims love using analogies. Go ahead and use them too.

To the deconverting part: 

**Encouraging cognitive dissonance** is absolutely key. Let's all think back to what happened when we first started to deconvert. It shakes you internally, we need this shaking to begin. Now, the thing about it is that:

* It won't always work : This is because every person operates differently. There are two types of religious people in Islam in my experience, those who invest in it for the **emotional** side of things and those who believe it because they believe it's ""**logical/is scientific**"". People with higher levels of faith (typically parents/elders) invest in Islam with both these reasons, one does prevail though. They're the hardest to change. Now there's two ways I go about it. Either find out if possible the type of person they are and target that OR during the discussion see which side they respond to best.
* If the person is more emotional based: I find it's better to test the morality of Allah/the Prophet. The Aisha business is certainly a good start. Then there's the philosophical ideas on the things ""Allah"" has been said to have done in the past- like kill a bunch of homosexuals, spreading diseases, drowning people- that sort of thing.
* More logically based people are easier to tackle. Nine times out of ten they're already doubting their religion. Pose this statement: **""If I found one inconsistency in the Quran then I won't believe it's from Allah""**, they'll agree instantly. Then point out the inconsistencies/rubbish. Threads like [this recent one](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/x7yih/questioning_muslims_of_reddit_get_your_throwaways/) is a good fuel source.

You need to be informed before starting the discussion. Your lack of information or lack of knowledge in an area will be your weakness. Of course, you can't know everything, which is why keeping the discussion limited to roughly up to three topics is the best way to go about it. 

Truth is we all know we need to be having this conversation.

Let me hear your thoughts.

About 3.5 years ago I considered myself a muslim. I didn't give it much thought, but I was raised that way and believed. I wasn't strict about my faith, and started dating a guy at my high school. He encouraged me to question what I was told. At the same time, my family encouraged me to increase my faith. I was very confused, and ended up being a closeted ex-muslim president of a large MSA. 



My mom found out about my boyfriend once when I was a sophomore, and convinced me to leave him for Allah. I did, but we continued to talk and the problems it caused really made me think critically about islam. When I finally realized it was bullshit, we got back together. 



My mom found out again and this time was very angry. She sent me to live in the UAE with her brother. I spent my senior year here, taking islamic classes to make her happy, but still being in touch with my boyfriend. My mom wanted to keep me here and was starting to look for suitors for me to marry (including a doctor 10 years older than me). I knew I had to get out and put together a plan. 



I started tutoring and doing homework for other students, and made enough money for a flight home. I applied to a university amd got in mostly on scholarship. I took out a small student loan, made some calls and got a minimum wage job, and found an apartment that my boyfriend and I could afford. Everything was ready, and my escape date was set: June 29th, 2 days after I turn 18. 



My mom came to visit every few months and her last was this week. She came and made a decision. She wants to bring me home. She's purchasing a ticket for June 20th. She wants me to come back, not go to college, and spend the next year going to intensive islamic education programs. The first one starts on my 18th birthday. 



I need to get out. I have a whole life waiting for me, and I know the islamic education programs won't change anything. I'm considering just walking out as soon as I'm back in the states, but I need this to be mature. I can't tell her while I'm in the UAE as she might send me to Pakistan. How and when should I talk to her? I don't know what to say..I'm scared I'll really upset her. I don't want to break my mom's heart, but I can't stay with her. When the first year of islamic education doesn't change anything, what next? There's no future there. 


Thanks for taking the time to read all of that. Any advice would be much appreciated.

1335095321.0,28,self.exmuslim,smj21,Protip: The first thing you should do when trying to debunk 'miracle' verses in the Quran.,zulaikha_idris,39,11,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/smj21/protip_the_first_thing_you_should_do_when_trying/,"In my experience, when non-muslims (and ex-muslims) try to debunk 'miracle' verses in the Quran such as foretold scientific knowledge or prophecies, etc, most of them make the huge mistake simply taking the verse given by the Muslim apologist at face value and simply go with it. It's a huge mistake because you're already giving ground for your opponent's arguments by simply agreeing that the verse actually says what it says.

For example, here's the usual scenario that I usually see in debates between muslims apologists and non-muslims:

------------------------------------------------------------------
**Muslim:** Did you know that the Quran has foretold scientific knowledge? For example, it says in in Surah An-Naml Verse 88: *And you see the mountains, thinking them rigid, while they will pass as the passing of clouds. [It is] the work of Allah , who perfected all things. Indeed, He is Acquainted with that which you do.* As we know through modern science, mountains are merely the result of two plate tectonics that crash into each other, and these plate tectonics float over a vast layer of liquid magma called the mantle, very much like clouds. Mashallah, the holy Quran spook about such knowledge 1400 years earlier than even the western scientists!

**Non-muslim:** But surely there must be a rational explanation for it. The interpretation is too vague / It's just a coincidence / Maybe somebody changed the verse to suit today's scientific knowledge / Maybe muhammad learned from scholars of geology at the time / &lt;insert other other feeble counter argument here&gt;

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, as you see, the huge mistake the non-muslim made in his counter-argument is assuming that the verse given by the muslim apologist really actually says what it says. **You're already agreeing that the Quran actually says something about plate tectonics.**

That is why the foremost important thing to do when trying to counter these sort of arguments is simply by **CHECKING THE TRUE MEANING AND CONTEXT OF THE ACTUAL VERSE.**

Example for the 'moving mountains' claim above, [a simple research](http://quran.com/27) on the actual verse on the Quran itself reveals that the context of the verse is actually about the events leading to the Day of Judgement, where mountains literally float like clouds. It has absolutely nothing to do at all with plate tectonics, or geology or anything as such whatsoever. There, argument defeated with little effort. Easy, isn't it?

Another example is the famous 'sun is a light and moon is a reflected light' claim. [A simple search in Corpus Quran](http://corpus.quran.com/qurandictionary.jsp?q=nwr) reveals that the word used for 'reflective light' in the verse - NUR - has absolutely nothing to do at all with reflection within the context of the Quran; every single other verse that uses the word NUR simply means 'light' or 'illuminating light', not 'reflecting light'. Again argument defeated with little effort. 

If looking at the Quranic verse isn't enough, try tafsirs. The important thing is don't simply assume too quickly that the verses given by Muslim apologists mouth is truthful. Always check the sources first, then form an opinion. I think just about 99% of all claims of 'miracle verses' can be simply debunked just by remembering this method alone :D

Just a quick reminder to all of you out there: 

**Most muslims did not become muslims because of their knowledge of the quran and hadith.** 

**So do you need to spend even more years of your life reading up the quran and hadith simply to debate Friday Muslims?**

Read the Quran and Hadith, if you want to or have some sort of academic interest. Heck, you don't have to explain why you read it.

The point is that you do not have to do intense research simply to dismiss religion. Also remember there are so many other things you can do with your precious time. **You have just one life to live.**

**As a muslim, did you do an intense study on all other religions past and present before determining Islam was the true one?**

**When dealing with theists, remember the burden of proof is theirs as they are making the outrageous claims.** 

For me, religion falls under two headings:

1.  Validity
2.  Ethics

**By willing to discuss the ethics and morality of religion, you sometimes concede far too much already. Besides issues of morality are far more subjective than the validity of god's existence.**

&gt;Also while their arguments may hold up against other deists/theists; it fails miserably against people who refuse to drink the Kool Aid.

&gt;They have to first state what god is and how they got this info.

&gt;Then they have to prove a god exists and support this with some objective evidence or arguments. 

&gt;They also have dismiss every other possible explanation they are faced with such as logical fallacies, cognitive biases, wishful thinking,etc.

&gt;Then they have to disprove all other religions ever and show why their brand of theism is the right one.

&gt;Then they have to explain away all the contradictions in their religion.

&gt;Then they have to prove other claims like god is perfect and just.

&gt;All those initial steps are bypassed if the people they are debating with have such low standards as to except faith as sufficient.

&gt;You will save yourself a great deal of bother, if you first ask them to prove god exists and that he is indeed their particular god before debating about things like his infallibility and justness.

**NOTE: The above is more for shutting down theist sermons/Dawah than about convincing others.**

**Addendum**: Although in this day and age, there is less reason to fall for the religious bullshit- even back in ancient times when we knew far less, there was still a good argument to not believe:

**Just because there is a gap in your knowledge, you simply can not say ""God must have done it"". Not only does this leave a greater question to be answered it, it does not even answer the initial gap and often stifles further questioning.**

It takes far more courage and intellectual honesty to say you don't know the answer than to accept a bad one.

Of course he brought up ""miracles"" like enzymes secreted from the finger tips. He also started talking about early Muslim conquests such as Khalid ibn Alwalid and a few others. Of course all I could do was sit there, listen, agree and toss in a few subhanallahs. He said he was learning Arabic and admired Arabs because they could read the Quran from birth. I almost got the feeling he wished he could be Arab if he could.

This brings me back to the title of my post. I feel so guilty as an Arab former muslim because we have continually invaded and destroyed, converted, killed, and assimilated so many other cultures throughout the centuries. 

I always feel sad when I see or hear about non-arabs being subjected to the more violent parts of Islam.

I get sad that people are forcefully being made to read some book which they don't even understand just so they could please a god that wasn't kind enough to send them a holy book in their own language(124000 prophets that Islam claims were sent not withstanding).

So many different and beautiful cultures lost because of a violent and expansionist ideology.

And it especially breaks my heart knowing it's all false and seeing these people devote their lives to Islam. And even oppressing the people who try to carry on their country's former culture.

Not to mention the billions that flows in corrupt hands of a kingdom that couldn't give 2 shits about their plights, countries, or cultures and in fact looks down on them for not being ""pure"" enough Islamically as thry regard the only people to be ""true"" muslims are those that speak Arabic natively.

Recently Ramadaan has started and my family spends a third of the day in the masjid every day. When my mom tells me go read a para of the quran or read 20 rakat of nafal I don't say anything other than ""ok"" and either half assedly do it, or flat out lie. I've gotten pretty good at lying since I decided I was an atheist. I remember the first time I lied as a kid I cried because I regretted it so much and begged my parents to forgive me. Now I feel like I've gotten pretty good at it. I can look lie through my teeth convincingly and my mom thinks I'm still her one kids who is on the righteous path. 

I've been doing this for about four years now (started when I was 12, now I'm 16), and it's become a normal thing. I lie about praying, I lie about reading quran, and every time I speak to my family members I'm either silent or nodding my head, faking my agreement, even if I think what they say is truly fucked up. My life seriously is a lie. I can't find any other way to put it. 

The worst part is that there's absolutely nothing I can do about it but suck it up keep the lies going. I seriously think I'll have to keep this going til my parents die. I've seen what happens with my older sister when she disagrees with any of Islams teachings. Nothing good will come from that. My mom turns into another person when religion is involved. My parents are in their 50s and are pretty unhealthy. I wonder if they'll die before they find out...

I've gotten so used to it that I don't get mad anymore. I just kind of feel a layer of sadness among all my emotions and thoughts. It's faint but it's always there. I don't think Islam has brought anyone in my family actual happiness. It's definitely made my parents fear death, made me feel guilty, and in my opinion, has negatively affected every action and thought of mine. I wonder if I woulda been better at football in middle school and freshman year if I didn't have to fast during the season and didn't always have to eat pb&amp;j when I wasn't at home. I wonder if I would have made more friends if I wasn't so scared as a kid. I wonder if things would have been different if I realized that being near a girl wouldn't kill me. But by the time I wizened up I was already a loner and had developed piss poor social skills.

At least once school starts again I'll be busy enough to say I don't have time for too much religion. My dad and siblings back me up when it comes to this, so I try to just work my ass off at school, stay there as long as possible, and make the days go by as fast as possible with studying and school work next year. Some kids say that I'll die next year, but I think I can handle it. 

Once again, I don't think blaming my parents will do any good. I see them as victims here too. I don't think they're willing to question Islam after being hard core Muslims all their life. 

Two more years of this can't be that bad right? Hopefully the future will be better, cause that and my little brother are the only two things keeping me going. Despite how everything is right now I really think that things'll get better if i tough it out. Thanks for reading if you made it all the way down here.

1364724206.0,29,self.exmuslim,1bcouu,A dialogue concerning women is in dire need. Here's my personal story.,caravaggisti,33,4,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1bcouu/a_dialogue_concerning_women_is_in_dire_need_heres/,"I would like to present my story, my personal experiences. I don't enjoy talking about the experiences that have shaped me. In fact, I'm rather ashamed because I still suffer and deal with the residual effects of what my parents and siblings have done and said to me. Under the stress of school and work and a failing social and personal life, it's started to aggravate my daily functioning. I fall into periods of apathy and depression. The people I speak to, tell me it's okay to drop out of school. My friends and family are shocked that I should drop out. Frankly, I feel like a bum going nowhere regardless, in or out of school. Some people think I'm shy. Some people dismiss me easily because I""m not well-spoken. The truth is, my heart pounds and my mind turns off. That's why I enjoy writing. That's why I enjoy coming here. I write better than I speak (sometimes at least). This is me now. I'm going to go back 14 years. 

I questioned Islam first and foremost because of the way I was treated. I was treated dfiferentl because I am a female. This started when I was 8.

&gt;Allah instructs you concerning your children: for the male, what is equal to the share of two females. But if there are [only] daughters, two or more, for them is two thirds of one's estate. And if there is only one, for her is half. And for one's parents, to each one of them is a sixth of his estate if he left children. But if he had no children and the parents [alone] inherit from him, then for his mother is one third. And if he had brothers [or sisters], for his mother is a sixth, after any bequest he [may have] made or debt. Your parents or your children - you know not which of them are nearest to you in benefit. [These shares are] an obligation [imposed] by Allah . Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Wise. (4:11)

I read the Quran in English because I was being bratty about learning Arabic. Farsi was my first language, English my second (and best). 4:11 was something my young self could understand. I knew what it was like to have someone get more than me. I knew my brothers had other priveleges that I did not. I asked my father why my brother would get more than me, and I only half a share. My father patted me on the head and told me my husband would have a whole share and he would work and take care of me and our children. My life, it seems, was planned out from day one. Husband dearest would be ""taking care of me.""

I neglected the Quran a while after that but my parents didn't give up the ""proper Muslim daughter"" ideology they used to constantly shame me and tear down my esteem. Cook, clean, make tea for the parents. ""If you didn't do any of these, then what use are you?"" Cue guilt trips. Cue telling me I was a mistake. Cue telling me 3 boys were good enough. Cue telling me they wish I was aborted but thier fear of Allah was too strong. 

I had to endure double-standards. I only have male siblings and grew up around their friends and our male cousins. I followed them around everywhere. I was either chastized for being amongst boys and at the same time my parents nagged them to take care of me while they worked to put food on the table. My brothers treated me as a burden too. So, most of the time, they made me stay home, unsupervised, all day, while my brothers went out, played sports, and socialized. My youngest brother was the only one there for me. Ever. But he struggled himself but he still tried to live a normal life. That was hard, considering our eldest brother physically and emotionally abused the two of us. The middle brother never put himself in the middle and avoided any conflict. My parents said that eldest male were in charge of everyone else, so, if he's using physical force, he's doing it for a reason. Well, it progresssed for a good 9 years. I can't stand being in the same room as him without suppressing the urge to strangle him. I moved out permanently in August. I would rather be a prostitute and rent out my vagina to support myself than to live under the same room as him.

Academically, I was less than average. I scraped by. No one cared. No one noticed. I was told I wasn't good enough to go to university or college from a young age. I can't even clean or cook for my parents. What does education matter? I'm not good enough for it anyway. The hypothetical husband my parents sprang up on me would not be able to handle my mouthiness, my inability to scrub tubs. By the end of high school, I brought my marks up just enough to get an acceptance to 3 out of 4 universities. No one ever talked to me about my grades, post-secondary education, the trades, nothing. When I said I would go off to university, no one cared. In 
fact, a brother made my life a living hell, advising my parents what they should do with me -- anything from going out with what friends I had to them telling me to not go to university because *I* had no money saved up. 

My middle brother, the one who avoided getting involved, internalized the conflict around him. He then decided to involve himself in my life all throughought middle school and high school was especially watchful that I don't see any boys. My parents were the same, so, I wasn't allowed to go out much at all. Funny thing is, I never had an interest in sex anyway. I was a dork. Well, up until last year, he finally started to let go. That was until he told me I could move in with him (to get away from our eldest brother) but on the circumstance that I do not have people or boyfriends over, I tell him where I am everyday, and that I do not bring any haraam products (ie pork) into his home. That is, of course, unless it's marijuana and alcohol he and his wife enjoy. I turned down his offer. This resulted in him telling my parents the ground rules I refused which led them to think I was either a, fucking guys, b, eating pork (aka, not a Muslim!).  

Well, now, My parents now are supporting me. They've gotten older and realized that their little girl can disappear and never see them again if she wishes. They realize now that I'm nothing what they thought or told me I was.

I live on my own now and am trying to find a way to make things work for myself.

As I shared my story with you, I need to make it clear that the ex-Muslim crowd is a sausage fest offline (meet-ups, for example) just as much as it is online. Men outnumber us. When I come here to discuss feminism regarding Islam (which btw, is very different from what the white, Western, feminism the jokes are always about on the posts in r/exmus), I would like it to be taken seriously. I have tried to have a sense of humour about it. I haven't been able to laugh much. In fact, it's triggered some things for me. 

Regardless, I simply ask that you hear my story and understand why I'm upset. Please at least discuss what you don't like about it. Quote the article. Link to sources to support your opinion. Let's at least talk about it seriously. For some reason women's issues around here is just some big joke. 

This mostly for recovery. I am still recovering. This is my only outlet to speak about the part of Islam that I despise. Despite everything that's happened to me, I still love my parents and my family, depite my estrangement. I target Islam instead.

I know that we don't have a strong emphasis on women's issues as much in this subreddit. I do not wish to imply that it's because men are not sympathetic, not understanding, or caring about the other half of the human race. Everyone had their reason for deconversion and no one's reason around here has priority over the other. But believe it or not, for me it was women and human rights violations.

If it's not an area you wish to speak about in a constructive manner, please refrain from commenting. Or at least keep in mind what I had to go through, your sisters, your mothers, your friends, a hell of a lot of women in this world. And keep in mind, a majority of what I said could have been done to a male. Islam is patriarchal. Everyone's a victim. But men do have a privilege in Islam and the suffering I and many others had to endure was because they were women. 

Thanks for listening.

The fact is that atheists simply do not see any good evidence for the existence of a god.

The other day he starts posting shit like ""My only hope is to be the protector of my Muslim brothers one day in court! I will never defend a *kaafir*."" on Facebook.

I'm intrigued so I ask him about it, and his answers kind of shocked me, to be honest. Goes like this:
""So what if you're defending a muslim guy against a kaafir and you realise your client is guilty?""
""I must still do my duty as a good muslim. Even if he is guilty, the fact that he does not believe in Allah makes him a worse person than the muslim I'll be defending.""
""Are you fucking serious? How can you say that someone's life is worth more than another because of his religon?""
""Well, as long as someone has pronounced the shahada, it is true; he is superior to all human beings who have not. In any case, an infidel will be eventually doomed to hell in Allah's court.""
""Dude, how can you say that, do you not care about defending the innocent or what is right?""
""I believe Allah will be fair to them in the afterlife.""
""But you just said they'll go to hell!""
""Guess it's just too bad, then. They should have repented and submitted to their *rabb*.""
""So what about this situation: you're defending a muslim against another muslim, and your guy is guilty.""
""Then I will pray that Allah guide me, and I know he will be fair because all parties are muslim.""


At this point I couldn't go on with the conversation because I was too busy losing faith in humanity and trying to kill myself. I just don't understand how a supposedly intelligent person can think like this. I mean, the guy was in the top 20 students of the whole country. What the fuck!?

I take some sort of comfort in looking back and realizing that I was never content with this religion to begin with. For me it was never about temptation, but if you give me a rule, I'll break it. Here is some of the crazy shit I pulled to get through those years:

- When I reached 'puberty' at age 13, I cried because I knew what came with being a 'woman'...SO I just never told my mom...I could keep wearing shorts and tank tops, go swimming and not be accountable for prayers or fasting (looking back -this was genius!) It wasn't till I was almost 17 that my mom wanted to take me to the doctor haha

- I got super effing good at changing my clothes. ANYWHERE. I could change while driving. I would leave for everywhere in sweatpants and make my transformation on the way to my destination.

- I lied for several years that I was taking 'flute lessons' when I was really going to a dance studio to take ballet. I would even carry my flute case and sheet music with me to keep up the pretense. 

- Later I would pretend that I was going to 'work' when I was really driving downtown for ballet classes. One time I got into a car accident on my way to the city and I drove my damaged car back to fake that the accident happened 5 miles from my parents house.

- Sneaking in through windows that I set up to look like they were locked so I could push them open from the outside later.

- At sunday school I would just sit in the back and listen to music on headphones under my hijab and then when I could drive, I would drop off my brother, pretend like I was parking and tail it out of there.

- To make myself feel better about everything I was doing I told myself that I could be religious when I was old. LOL

- I know my parents inside out. I've been living with my atheist/caucasian boyfriend for the past 2 years since I've moved out and they don't have a single clue. They've even come to pick me up/drop me off from/to my apt.

I'm not sharing this to boast. Looking back, I'm just proud at the things that I've done to maintain and create freedoms for myself.

So I met another /r/exmuslim 'er yesterday, I'll keep his username anonymous for now to respect his privacy. The guy has been going through some serious stuff, particularly around mental health issues. As we saw from the ""[How has your mental health been affected by Islam](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/wz3su/what_is_the_incidence_of_mental_health_problems/)"" thread, Islams's ""cultish"" approach to how to live life has taken its toll on many of us, including myself. 

I have met ex-muslims in various stages of this, some have been able to take up the daily struggle against their issues, like I with my anxiety. Others are still inflicted with them. Still, others are only discovering which pieces they've lost along the way.

*But you're not alone.* One thing this person mentioned was a feeling of utter, intense isolation. It meant a lot for both of us to be able to immediately connect, and understand how the both of us felt, just from a few words. Feelings of suicide. Actually trying. Depression. That's what isolation can mean.

As AgentVoid has made clear, this subreddit has taken a life of its own. It is starting to connect people. It is starting to help us understand how we're not alone. It's given us an opportunity to share information.

For anonymity, I won't disclose where I live. But I can't tell you how many ex-muslims I've met, this week, within a 1 mile radius. It is **insane** how many of us are there.

Try and reach out through here. Nothing will support you more than having someone who understands. Nothing makes me as happy as to know that there are guys and girls out there, who understand *everything* about my experience. In a way that other people simply can't (except for ex-Jehovah's Witnesses/Mormons, etc). 

It's always important to get psychological counselling. But there is only so much they can help, if you don't have an understanding community around you, with people who are going through, and have gone through similar rough patches.

Thanks for listening, amigos and amigas.

For me, I am truly appreciative of this month and the possibilities it holds because it always made me so lethargic and unproductive in the past.  I'm grateful for every bite I eat during the day and all the free time I have and goals I'm accomplishing all ready.


However, I see a lot of posts about getting drunk, or smoking, etc.  In a way this almost saddens me.  I mean, if you were going to do those things anyway, I get it, and it makes sense because you can continue doing those things like normal now and you don't have to deal with the Ramadan and Ummah guilt.  But if you aren't a drinker, or a smoker, or only usually do these things on occasion, then why do you feel the need to do these damaging things to your body in excess right now simply because its Ramadan and it rebels against Islam?  Isn't that almost as stupid as doing something damaging to your body (depriving it of food and water for a month) simply because Islam instructs you to do so? 


While I don't care any longer what is haram or halal, I will be the first to admit that there are quite a few things that make sense to be ""haram"".  Drinking for one, or smoking - what is the point?  To me I view both as unhealthy and bringing nothing of value to life.  Gambling is another.  The difference today is that I see these things are wasteful based on my own rational conclusions and not because a book or hadith mindlessly tells me so.  I'm open to interpretation and if I ever see value in these things I'll change my mind.


Anyway, I hope this message isn't preachy.  Not sure what I'm trying to accomplish here this is just more or less an open ended question to those of you who are doing this ""binge haraming"".  What do you hope to accomplish?  And do you think that damaging your health in rebellion of Islamic law is just as silly as damaging your health to follow Islamic law?  I'd love to hear your thoughts.  And also want to point out this is not a judgement call on those of you who are drinkers or smokers.  I do not think less of you or judge you and I hope it didn't come off that way.

As of now, I am not a Muslim by definition. I'm kind of having trouble with coming to terms with it, though. I really don't want to say it, but it is what is true.

To give some background of myself, I am a 17 year old American male who was born Muslim. My father is very religious and my mother was once Christian but converted sometime after they married. Although, the one thing I like is that she converted to Islam by choice. And that is my mindset at the moment. If it makes you happy and your decision was by choice and not being forced upon you then believe in it. 

I am identifying myself as agnostic. It is still very fuzzy for me because I am stuck between atheism and some type of agnosticism with a deity or god involved. I somewhat feel like there is something out there that started everything but then I don't. When I started realizing what I believe(or disbelieve), I felt a sort of true freedom, I can do whatever I want with my life, but it had a feeling of guilt with it because I left the only religion I knew. I still feel kind of guilty, but I'm sure it will pass. I haven't told anyone yet and I made this account just for the occasion of posting this. I guess this my way of accepting it. This is a big step for me and I felt the need to share with someone. Now, where to go from here?

1. Because I don't believe a just God would punish people for being bad to him, but rather, being bad to each other. In a nutshell, I wouldn't care whether people believe in me or not, as long as they are good to each other if I was a god.

2. One thing that I have already read on this subreddit, about how it's Hell's exhalation and inhalation that causes the seasons. -.-

3. There was one part of the Quran, where it talks about the prophet leading some Kafir (non believers) to a desert, where there was no one but him and them. Then, he split the moon in half to show them that he was a man of God. However, the Kafir were stubborn and held fast to their own beliefs. Really? Sure they don't believe and all, but they're not stupid! If someone split the moon in front of them, they wouldn't just ""be stubborn"". And splitting the moon? I'd like to see how that didn't fuck up the Earth's tides and etc.

4. Apparently, the prophet's soul was the first one ever created, and all other souls were just mere sweat droplets off of his. Seems like he was using his power over the early Muslims to do a bit of self-glorifying.

5. The one sin that will never be forgiven in Islam is Shirk, believing in more than one god. Therefore, there can be a person who kills thousands of people, but as long as he is either Muslim or atheist or non-theistic, he will go to heaven, but all the nicest Christians and Hindus and etc. will burn in Hell forever.

There are many more reasons, but I am unable to remember them right now, because it is 6:49 AM right now where I am.

My family doesn't know about my conversion, and if they did, I would most certainly die a horrible death at their hands.

So far, I have told five of my friends about my atheism (not telling more, because it might spread at school, and my brother might find out) and one of them went crazy trying to convert me back, the other two Muslims didn't want to enforce their beliefs on me, the Catholic tried to reason her own religion to me, but not too much, just for like five minutes, and the atheist was like ""hell, yeah.""

And you know something? It went well. It was easier than expected. It wasn't until after I spoke to the muhajiba woman than I realised she was a Muslim, and that I spoke to her.

I just feel like I'm really progressing, you know. Able to stand brief moments in just a t-shirt, didn't freak out when I wore one layer thick see through tights.

I feel less like an ""ex-Muslim"" and more like a person now if that makes any sense. Evidently I don't look Arab either, which is weird because I thought I was undeniably Arab. I guess outwardly I'm changing as well? Not too sure.

Guess I just wanted to update you guys. Hope your journey is also progressing.

I'm a 19 year old Palestinian-American. I've lived for 4 years in Palestine when I was a child/teen. (came back to the U.S when I was 13.)

I used to be the perfect Muslim boy (pray 5 times a day, etc) until about March of this year after my uncle passed away which was followed by a rough existentialist episode. 

My mom was very strict while I was growing up to the point that she never let me hang out with my classmates because they're all Americans. Therefore I've never had friends. It's very hard to admit, but I'm a typical loser. 

(I actually do have 1 friend right now that goes to college with me, but he's currently in Jordan for summer break.)

I've always resorted to religion to fill that friendship gap in my life, and I have to admit I was happier when I was a Muslim. I realize the reason why, but shit, ignorance is bliss.

I am an incoming sophomore at a major university and I'm majoring in pre-pharmacy. To get into pharmacy school (I have to complete my application in the fall) I need to have to have not only good grades but plenty of extracurriculars (volunteering, leadership, a job etc). My grades are pretty good (gpa is 3.85+), but I have literally no extracurriculars and no job.

I've spent the last 1.5 months just facebooking and redditing and most importantly realizing how fucking meaningless life is. (I tried to get a job, I've filled out over 50 job applications starting from April but didn't even get a call back from anyone. (Is it because of my name? who the fuck knows). 

Since my uncle passed away I have probably been depressed (not officially diagnosed, but I've not been happy in a LONG time). I've been thinking about committing suicide for a while and so I've made a deal with myself about a month ago: I'll end my life if I don't get accepted to pharmacy school. It is the last chance I have at life.

Thank you for reading, and I must apologize for the incoherence of this post. I just have a lot to rant about, but really no organization. Any input is appreciated.

The reasons as to why I converted are irrelevant now (and NOPE it was not for a ""Muslim boyfriend""). I actually converted to Islam i.e said my shahada before I did any serious study about Islam. 

The more I studied about Islam the more confused I became and the more doubts I had. A couple of my Questions on r/islam have been crossposted here before for comic purposes, so you might remember me from them.

I have quite a few doubts and I would be grateful if you could answer them. 

I've seen some great people here who give thought provoking and intelligent responses and I am only posting here to hear from them. 

I tried posting here under a throwaway a couple of months back and i got a lot of really immature and crude responses , asking if ""i was retarded to follow a pedophile sex addict and his teachings"" when i tried to defend the prophet or making jokes and statements which contributed nothing to my question and only made me feel like more of a fool for asking here.

I Just feel like i should give this sub another chance. So I'll start off with my first Question : 

Does The Quran really say that the Earth is flat or any such huge obvious blunders which contradict established facts ? 

(Oh and I am not talking about the obscure and complicated stuff about embryology or anything)

I've listened to the ""muslim"" explanations for these verses and frankly speaking I didnt find them to be extremely farfetched or ridiculous, but i repeatedly come across people here who claim that Quran is so ""stupid"" that it gets even the most basic facts wrong. Why these extreme views ? Can anyone (especially those who know arabic) comment upon this ?

We're pseudo-arabs. Raised to think we're arabs, but never treated the way others in our area were. As girls, we were never supported like other girls in the community. I actually had to beg for the $24 fee for my cap/gown when I graduated HS. My sisters have been through it too. We all experienced the rape aftermath when my parents called my sister a liar and said the rape was an excuse for her to be able to date and have sex (really...) and I think that hit them as hard as it hit me. 

We talk about it all the time, about when they can be financially free of our parents and take the road I took (education, self sufficiency) and get away from the hell we've lived our entire lives.

Out of the three posts that I have seen, they have just posted a copy/paste of some generic definitions (some of which are wrong). 

While I have nothing wrong with the message they are trying to spread. It's simply out of place in this subreddit unless there are direct examples to Islam to make it relevant. Is there mysogyny in Islamic nations? Of course there is. *RainSatan* is proof that a relevant post about feminism can be posted here in this sub. *lalib* on the other hand, is just posting generic irrelevant filler material. 

So while the topic is one that is very important, I think we should be able to frame it so that it's directly relevant with the issues of Islam. It should not be some patronizing attempt at ""education"", that treats everyone here like they're inherent monsters incapable of empathy.

Apparently this all came from this comment. [*""I would have been surprised id she would have said anything different. Thus my opinion the women are the biggest obstacle to their own progress.*""](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/comments/1eosfy/mother_of_oxford_sex_gang_pair_blames_their/ca2d48w)

Now, I'm not sure if people truly understood this comment or not. But my interpretation (which could be wrong) is, *ONE_deedat* was saying: Given the fact that the mother is a Muslim, it's expeected that she would be approving of certain Islamic ideology. Part of this ideology is mysogonistic. His opinion that women are the obstacle, could be better phrased as ""women like this mother are the biggest obstacles"". Women who accept their inferior role in a mysogonistic ideology are the obstacle. In those societies, women need to spark their own feminist revolution. They need to be the ones to reject their inferior status.

For whatever reason, this comment was seen as being a blight upon this sub. Whether it is or isn't, is not the issue here (I'm merely posting it for relevance). The issue is that content posted in this sub should be directly related to Islam.

Quite simply, I'm posting this on the advice of a mod. The strength of the comments will be taken into consideration, and not the votes/score. And after some time, they will discuss it, and make a desicion.

 Let's try to keep things civil, and rational, and discuss whether or not *lalib's* posts (as they currently exist) are relevent to this sub.

As a start point, here is what the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/exmuslim/wiki/faq#wiki_what.27s_the_purpose_of_r.2Fexmuslim.3F) says about it.

**What's the purpose of r/exmuslim?**

* A religion recovery subreddit - a support group. A place for empathy, commiseration, and advice.

* A place to discuss, vent, rant about the ill effects of the religion.

* A place to laugh at the silly side of the religion.

* A place to examine religious claims without the limits of dogma.

* A community.

According to this, it's quite clear that posts should be directly relatable to Islam. Simply saying that Islam is mysoginistic, so here is some 1st year feminism material... Is similar to going over to /r/alcohol and posting some 1st year chemistry material.
