1360984440.0,153,self.RandomActsOfPolish,18maxt,"I love you guys, so I have something to say; some of you won't like it. But think twice and do your research before you polish generously...",showurnuts,170,17,615,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/18maxt/i_love_you_guys_so_i_have_something_to_say_some/,"**ATTENTION: If you have polished menmybabies in the last month and feel like you may have been taken advantage of or cannot cancel the order, PLEASE CONTACT /u/kettish as soon as possible!**

Alright, so I can't really hold this back anymore. I'm not using a throwaway because fuck that, I'm not a damn coward. I stand strongly in my convictions, so come at me if you must, brethren. Some people here whom I consider friends may no longer like me because of this, or might disagree with me, and for that I am sorry... but I have to get this off my chest.

I have to ask a serious question first, but please do not read it as accusatory: **did I miss the make-up thread somewhere along the way, or do we all just have memories of a goldfish here?**

I've recently seen a lot of activity from a user that I have remained wary of since [this huge post 3 months ago.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12ty3e/announcement_public_advisory_regarding_a_member/) (P.S. 3 MONTHS AGO, REALLY? Not even before November/December??) When looking through the history of said user, dated to that time, there are numerous posts asking for help, begging for assistance, for food, and more. Feel free to read that PSA again and regard the image from the RAOPizza mod about the money wasted on this person. There are even people who had contacted this user for real life assistance but were denied, which is certainly peculiar; instead she asked them to ""send her pizza"" or something suspicious. [Her answers in the Q&amp;A thread were not helpful in easing the tension](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12ua3r/menmybabies_question_and_answer_session/?sort=new). Alas, a couple months pass, and it's all forgotten somehow. **For those of you who are recently new, even since the end of December, I advise you visit those two links for clarification. I am sorry you came into this sub not knowing any better about this.**

Now, this isn't on the same scale as that sweetbabiray asshole. That was just pure, unadulterated scamming with multiple accounts. This isn't scamming, by that definition. But this is the type of behavior that SHOULD NOT be welcomed in subreddits like this. This is NOT r/Assistance, nor is it r/PityPolishMePlease. It is RANDOM ACTS. Meaning random gifting using randomizers, winning contests, befriending cool people and gifting them once in a while to show your love, and exchanges. It is not ""post 50 threads over and over bemoaning your life and dumping on us every single instance of shit in your life"" then having a link to your wishlist which mostly consists of very expensive polishes like Butter London and Deborah Lippman. (Really, not a single $4 China Glaze?) There has also been mention of this person PMing others asking them to ""buy her"" polishes from a store she already has near her, with the promise of old polishes. Those users can clarify here if they wish. But that shit shouldn't be allowed, either.

Some of you may be regulars in other places like RAOAmazon, where a mod recently posted about keeping the sob stories to a minimum, or if you post one it should encourage deep discussion over it. RAOPizza has already crossed the line of having 80% sob story posts asking for pizza because their pet died, their car died, and their favorite movie star died. We can't allow RAOPolish to go down this route.

Did you have a bad day and want to vent to your friends here? Go right ahead, we're here to listen. Did something terrible out of your control, like a natural disaster, affect you recently? Please let us know. Updates are especially welcome when encouraged. (I'm saying this because I want to make it clear that I'm not talking about people who have recently had sudden tragedies befall them.) We can tell when it's just an OT rant or needing some advice, because you're otherwise probably a chipper and active contributor.

But when almost all of your self-posts are about what's wrong in your life, how one thing is happening and you can't afford another, then maybe you need to reevaluate your time spent here on reddit... I think that's what gets to me most about this user to whom I'm referring. The main crime here is misplaced priorities. Unless this person suddenly obtained a stable, well-paying job, why are you here buying people things one week, and then the next saying you're too broke to do anything at all?

For those who are bombarded with problems and have little money yet have children to feed... why are you on this subreddit? If that were me, my priorities would be on my family and myself, and I would avoid reddit. I'd feel ashamed flashing wishlists and constantly tugging on all of these generous people's heartstrings, knowing I couldn't give back as well.

If you just want to have people to talk to, message these folks. Keep in touch with chats, Facebook, or something.

I'm not trying to tell people to quit polishing sob stories. Polish whoever you want, it's obviously your money and your choice. I wouldn't presume to dictate who can come here, but I think some people should seriously evaluate their positions carefully before spending so much time on here constantly posting their drama or going through expecting lots of expensive polish. I don't want to see this RA sub start to follow the same path as some other ones where some feel like they have to gain pity to be gifted or receive something. **Nor should those who have previously broken our trust be allowed to come back here so soon, just to subtley start over again.**

Those are my two cents, and I'm sticking to them. Feel free to give yours.

edit: To clarify, there is a difference between venting and *sob stories*. At some point, one is less acceptable than the other.

EDIT TWO: APPARENTLY THIS PERSON WAS PM'ING PEOPLE, TRYING TO COZY UP TO THEM AND GAVE SOB STORIES. THIS IS ALSO UNACCEPTABLE. DO NOT DO THIS HERE.

I cannot tell you how rare it is to do the kinds of designs and art that we do, by ourselves.

When people comment on my nails, they almost always assume that they are 1.  Decals/nail apps or 2.  Done professionally.  And my designs don't always look perfect or anything; I just put a lot of time into it.  When I notice other people's fancy nails and comment on them, they almost always refer me to the nail tech who did the design for them.

Now, I'm not hating on anybody who opts to have their nails done professionally.  I get it; it's time consuming, and takes a lot of practice to do what we do.  BUT we should all take a moment to be proud of ourselves and our rogue nail art abilities.

And for all of you who I see posting things like ""I know I'm not as good as some of you, but..."":  Stop it.  Just stop.

I posted this a while ago, but with the holidays around the corner, I figured more people might want to take advantage :)
Hi ! I've seen a bunch of you complain about prices of polish outside the US and, well, I feel bad. I wish I could polish all of you, but ain't nobody got money for that :P But if you'd like, I can be your polish middleman of sorts. You can order a polish on US amazon for cheap, have it ship to me (Florida), and I could just ship it to you for around $2. For example, if you want SOTT but don't want to pay the crazy $15 or whatever they're charging elsewhere, you could PM me for my address, buy it for the $6 they charge here, and have it sent to me, PayPal me $2, and when I get it I'll send it to you so instead of $15 plus shipping, it would only be $8 or so :) I wish I could forward it to you out of my own pocket, but I want to be able to do this for as many people as possible and if I used my own money I would only be able to do a few. I could also get brands here that might not be available elsewhere. If this breaks any rules, let me know but I've polished here, and swapped at RLS, /r/braswap, and /r/closetswap. Plus you would have my address so scamming you wouldn't be very smart on my part :P
So, PM me if you're interested. Happy holidays ! :)

",OkraWimprey,78,11,170,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12gzks/the_moment_youve_all_been_waiting_for_the_1000/,"(In my best OkraWimprey voice) It's time for a little Secret Santa Extravaganzaaaaaaaaa!!

THIS is going to be fun!!! It's almost that time of year, the time to send polish packages of cheer! 

If you would like to participate, you will be matched up with another user in your price tier. You will be responsible for creating a wonderful package of delight, and shipping that delightful package to your giftee's home by the deadline. This means your personal address will be provided to your Secret Santa. All packages/gifts must be sent via postal mail. Amazon gifts are not accepted for this one.

In order to allow for maximum participation, there will be four price tiers. $10-20, $20-30, $30-40, and $40-50. This is the amount you will spend on the items and do not include shipping costs.

Later today, I will post the signup threads for everyone to enter. There will be two separate signup threads, One for $10-20 and $20-30, and another for $30-40 and $40-50. Once the entry period ends, I will be sending a questionnaire to fill out and return with allergies/likes/dislikes, ect. Deadline for entry will be midnight EST on Sunday, November 11th. Those who failed to meet the polishing requirement of the polish bomb are not eligible to participate.

**As I did with polish bomb, the entry posts will be no discussion threads. Please only post the price range that you would like to enter. All questions and comments will belong in this thread** 

Secret Santas will be required to come back to your post on the official entry thread and post a proof screenshot of the closed package once it is addressed and ready to ship out (obviously with everything but the first 2 letters of the first name blocked out) as well as sending in a pic of the delivery confirmation.

The rules of the Secret Santa will be that at least one item has to be polish related. Other than that, anything goes!

**All gifts will be required to be mailed on or before December 5th, 2012.**

LOOK NO FURTHER MO'FUCKAZ!",FggyGggls,57,5,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12ko8x/brittle_broken_nails_grand_canyon_style_nail/,"I've seen a lot of posts about flaking, peeling, breaking, ridges, and cuticle sadness. I know all the products to combat these problems are a little expensive, but that is what wishlists are for, right? Now, onto bid'niss. 

I think all of us are in agreement that [Biotin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biotin#Hair_and_nail_problems) is awesome for the peelies/flakies and it is awesome for your skin and hair as well. I take it daily and highly recommend it. If vitamins aren't your bag you would want to invest in a strengthening base coat such as [Essie Protein Base Coat](http://www.amazon.com/Essie-Protein-Basecoat/dp/B0006PJSUC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965608&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=essie+protein+base+coat), [OPI Nail Envy](http://www.amazon.com/OPI-Nail-Natural-Strengthener-0-5-Ounce/dp/B00178TVXG/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965651&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=opi+nail+envy), or [Zoya Anchor](http://www.amazon.com/Anchor-ZTAN01-Zoya-Nail-Treatments/dp/B000NCX46M/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965695&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=Zoya+base+coat).

Have stupid crazy ridges in your nails from biting them for years? Try [Essie Ridge Filling Base Coat](http://www.amazon.com/Essie-Ridge-Filling-Base-Coat/dp/B000Z61UDA/ref=sr_1_10?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965818&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=ridge+filler), [OPI Ridge Filler](http://www.amazon.com/Opi-Ridge-Filler-5-oz/dp/B000NGLR62/ref=sr_1_2?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965818&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=ridge+filler0), [Orly Ridge Filler](http://www.amazon.com/Orly-Ridgefiller-0-6oz/dp/B000O2T1EK/ref=sr_1_2?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351966013&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Orly+ridge+filler) or [China Glaze Ridge Filler Base Coat](http://www.amazon.com/China-Glaze-FILLER-Polish-Treatment/dp/B0085YZYUE/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351965899&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=china+glaze+ridge+filler).  

Are your cuticles pitiful, ripped chunks of skin? Read on my friends! For nail biters/pickers unhealthy cuticles are sometimes the hardest problem to fix plus they're extremely painful! Grab yo'self some [cuticle cream](http://www.amazon.com/Burts-Bees-Cuticle-Creme-Butter/dp/B00013YYS0/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351966540&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=cuticle+oil) or [cuticle oil](http://www.amazon.com/Essie-Apricot-Cuticle-Nail-Treatment/dp/B000VV1YOY/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351966540&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=cuticle+oil) to moisten those bad boys up! Once they're healthy and in one piece you can think about removing them if you don't like they way they look. Never ever cut your cuticles off! I admit I used to do this... but don't! Trimming your cuticles leaves your nail beds open to sad time infections. I personally use [Sally Hansen Gel Cuticle Remover](http://www.amazon.com/Sally-Hansen-Gel-Cuticle-Remover/dp/B003VDGIU4/ref=sr_1_3?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351966671&amp;sr=1-3&amp;keywords=sally+hansen+cuticle+remover) to get rid of 'em.

Of course you can find these types of base coats/strengtheners/cuticle whatnots in whichever brand you prefer, these brands just happen to be popular and highly recommended around here. 

Now onto tricks of the trade! A good [Crystal file](http://www.amazon.com/INTRODUCTION-Premium-Manicure-Crystal-Cheeky-Rainbow/dp/B005WTKB2Q/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351966212&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=crystal+file) will help combat flaking and peeling as long as you file in one direction instead of back and forth, or in a 'sawing' motion. Crystal files are the shizz because they will seal the tip of your nail instead of leaving them raw and jagged. [Wrapping your tips](http://www.alllacqueredup.com/2010/06/manicure-trick-wrap-tips.html#.UJVeq8XA8sc) with your base coat, polish, and top coat will ensure that your mani will last longer without chips. Love glitter but hate destroying your nails every time you go to remove it? Try using an [Elmer's Glue base coat](http://wackylaki.blogspot.com/2012/08/tutorial-peel-off-base-coat.html) instead! You'll be able to peel your polish off in one piece and the glue doesn't damage your nails. Win/win fo sho! Have a nasty tear at the base of your nail? Don't cut them all down, instead try the [tea bag technique!](http://wackylaki.blogspot.com/2012/09/tutorial-tuesday-tea-bag-nail-repair.html) This trick has saved my nails so many times, lemme tell ya. 

Lastly, I've seen a couple ladies over in r/redditlaqueristas distraught over gloopy, old polishes that they want to revive. Some ladies suggest pouring a couple drops of polish remover in the bottle to thin it out again. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT DO THIS. EVER. Polish removers are made to break down polish and that is exactly what it'll do if you mix them together. Let's try 1-3 drops of [Beauty Secrets Polish Thinner](http://www.amazon.com/Beauty-Secrets-Nail-Polish-Thinner/dp/B004F82HB8/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351967065&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=beauty+secrets+polish+thinner) instead. You can find this at Sally's for around $5 and it will last forever.  

That is all I can think of for now but feel free to ask questions and any of us here will be happy to help! Also if you think of something I forgot, post it!  

This is FggyGggls and I approve this wall of text.  

**EDIT:** A good example of how awesome the tea bag trick is! I used to not be able to paint one of my nails because of an accident when I was kid.

Our fantastic mod kettish does so much for us, paid over $100 shipping the indie contest prizes out of her own pocket, and keeps this place faaaaaabulous, all with a smile. Let's show her how much we appreciate her and love her! About 15 of us have been planning for a few weeks, but we'd like to invite you all to jump on in! Here's the guidelines we'd like to follow:

1) It's happening right now! Go go go! We don't know when she'll be on for the day, so we'd like to just totally flood the subreddit with polish love. As soon as we see her online, we'll be drawing her attention to it! 

2) When you polish her, please put [Bombed], and keep the actual item details hidden! &gt;D Tracking numbers are fine. If you don't buy off Amazon and want link karma, [please use this image!](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/34562589.jpg) Your own is fine too :D

3) Wishlists:
[Her Amazon wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/1471AF2UVTYTY);
[Amazon Indies wishlist](http://www.amazon.com/registry/wishlist/2G0T9BK68UFP7/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go_v_T1-2);
[Her etsy registry](http://www.etsy.com/registry/MTQ0ODR8NjI5OTg3Ng/)

4) Not everyone is gifting directly off her wishlist, so if you're unsure whether something was already bought, [come talk to us on chat! We can confirm/deny for you off the master list without kettish getting to see what was purchased &gt;D](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=kettishrocks)

Seriously, kettish does so much for us and we love her to bits, and she deserves her own polish bombing. Join us!

Tell me, what if we had a *sisterhood of the travelling laquer?* I don't know how we'd get it started or anything, but we have one really good quality nail polish -  like Butter, or, in case it gets broken or something, OPI. Whatevs. So anyways, someone would start it, buy the nail polish, paint their nails once, and then send it on to another deserving lady (maybe we'd have a forum, where people would comment and say something along the lines of ""I'd like to be part of the sisterhood of the travelling lacquer"") along with a picture of the mani, a note, and maybe a few other goodies. The next woman would be able to keep the goodies (of course! :D) but have to keep the note and the picture in the box. Then she'd do her part, send it on, and it'd keep on keeping on. Until the bottle ran out, and then it would go back to the original buyer, and she'd get to see what cool manis everyone has done.

Totally worth it!,gemcitytiffany,47,0,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/18s8yk/the_dramatic_tale_of_my_sinful_color_haul_totally/,"I ride my bike to work and back. It's about a mile and it's no big deal. 

Today I figured I'd ride over to Walgreens to pick up the new sinful colors, especially after /u/WineandWhiskey told us about the $1 off coupon. 

I'm an avid cyclist, but I took the winter off other than commuting because its just been so cold. I rode a few miles to Walgreens and went to lock up my bike. 


**My keys. I don't have them.**

They are still at work. Ugh!!!!

I ride all the way back to work. I think really hard about how bad I want these polishes. I decide to just do it. 

I ride back, it's uphill btw and now there's a 15mph headwind! FML. 

I get there and they have a lot of the new stuff which I'm happy about. 

I joke with the lady at the cosmetics counter about the crap I went through to buy these. She shows me the different displays and I pick what I want. 

I bring them up with the sales flyer and ask about the 3 polish limit for the $1 off. She tells me she can use it on all of them. ALL OF THEM. 

[For $8 I got 9 polishes and a $3 remover tub!](http://i.imgur.com/wu9kXgV.jpg)

So $5 for the 9 polishes! It was so worth it. And at least going home was downhill with the wind on my back :D",,False,self,t5_2ukje,False,,,True,t3_18s8yk,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/18s8yk/the_dramatic_tale_of_my_sinful_color_haul_totally/,

I'd like to give and receive colors FOR the holidays, but I'm not sure what everyone's opinions on that are. General thoughts? I know after the holidays are over was a popular idea, but it just seems less festive and more chaotic to me, but I'm only one opinion.

1361004898.0,43,self.RandomActsOfPolish,18mq4v,MOD ANNOUNCEMENT - A FEW THINGS WE NEED TO DISCUSS...,OkraWimprey,52,9,174,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/18mq4v/mod_announcement_a_few_things_we_need_to_discuss/,"Firstly, we apologize that we haven't assisted our newer members out more, but here's what we're doing to move forward:

**The weekly ventilation thread will return again in order to keep it all in one area and under control. Beginning on Monday, all ranting/venting posts will belong in the weekly thread only.**

As previously mentioned, currently the venting/ranting posts are out of hand. I suspected it was just due to Valentine's Day and people being depressed, ect, but it has simply become too much. It is understandable to want to share the happenings of your life, both good and bad, with the group, but we all must remember that there is a fine line between sharing personal information amongst friends and coming off as begging to other members. 

As for the MeNMyBabies issues, I realize there are many different opinions going around. **We have implemented a temporary ban on this user while we sort this all out and come to a decision on how the situation will be permanently handled.** As it is close to 5am, Kettish and I are waiting on other mods to give their input so that we can all make a decision together. Personally I have tried to give her the benefit of the doubt and view her as a member who simply posts frequently about the negative aspects of her life, which rubs many members the wrong way. Frustrating to some? Yes. This is a tricky situation since she has successfully polished many members as well as completed both her polish bomb and Secret Santa requirements. None the less, I respect all opinions and it will be handled by the entire mod team. If she is PMing people and asking for things, that is in direct violation of the rules. Please screenshot me directly if this has happened. We are doing our best to deal with the situation fairly and swiftly.

**In general I do want to remind everyone to please do your due diligence when polishing.**

We are all about the joy of gifting here. I love the way so many of our members embrace others and gift selflessly. With the good nature of so many of our members, it is inevitable that some people in the world may try to take advantage of us. While none of us want to suspect someone is being fraudulent, if we each do our due diligence it will help us all in the long run.

While it is certainly wonderful to receive, it should never be expected. It is an unfortunate reality that we are going to experience some members popping in for a ""free gift"" but never posting or returning the love. Many members just like to give randomly and don't mind if a member is active or returns the generosity. Since we all gift at our own risk, if you prefer to only gift to those you feel are ""deserving"" or active in the community please be sure to do your due diligence. By checking a members profile or conducting a quick search you will be able to find out if they are an active member or a lurker before making your decision whether you would like to gift that person. I hate to see hurt feelings or gift regret.

**If you choose to gift someone because of a negative event in their life, or to cheer them up please keep in mind that this is the internet, and anyone can say anything. Maybe they didn't get into a huge fight with their best friend, maybe they didn't really break their toe, and maybe ninjas didn't really break into their house and eat all their FunYuns. We will never really know, and unfortunately that is a risk we take when gifting strangers. I advise only gifting others when you are financially able to and when you expect nothing in return.**

Personally, when I gift to help brighten someone's spirits that is just that. If I later find out the person isn't what I thought they were, while it is a huge disappointment, I still enjoy knowing that I made someone's day better whether they deserved it or not in my opinion. 
When committing random acts of kindness in real life, I follow the same guidelines. Maybe the ""homeless"" man on the corner really lives better than I do, maybe the woman who's handful of groceries I just paid for went home and mistreated her family, maybe the person in the car behind me in the fast food line who enjoyed a free ice cream cone from me went on to work and embezzled thousands of dollars that day. I'll never know, and that's just fine with me. I've done my part in putting good karma out into the world, and that is how RAoP should be as well.

**Just a few more reminders:**

Please refrain from any postings offering to swap gift cards, nail polish, panda bears, ect. Since we are growing at such a fast pace, we must also take steps to limit anything which may open us up for scammers and the like. If you are looking to trade in a gift card, you may want to check out [Cardpool.com.](http://www.cardpool.com) I have not personally used them but they appear to offer the option to trade your gift cards in electronically for an Amazon gift card, which may be helpful for many of you.

If you have nail polish to swap, please check out [Reddit Laquerista Swap.](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditlaqueristaswap) Many of the members on that subreddit are verified and trustworthy, and you are likely to be able to complete a successful swap there.

If you have a panda to swap, well then I just don't have much advice for you on that one. I would however, love a picture of the panda wearing a ""NO MAAM"" T-shirt and snuggling a photo of Al Bundy, so if you could arrange that, that'd be great.

In addition, in order to help reduce the amount of lurkers in the community, I am still checking the never been polished list and the wishlist links that appear in the randomizer and removing the wishlists of those who have never posted here before or have not posted in quite some time.

Lastly, if you are new to the group please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the sidebar and the use of our tags. **Please only use the allotted tags listed in the sidebar.** Just a quick reminder that it is not necessary to use am [OT] tag, since all topics are allowed here. Just go ahead and post away! :)

We have just added a mod today who's duties will entail specifically adding contests to the sidebar. The good news is we have so many contests we cannot keep up. The bad news is we have so many contest we cannot keep up. LOL

Hopefully this will solve the issue. :)

My mom always says that when it rains it pours, and that seems to be the case in our tiny little corner of reddit.

We mods have pledged to let everyone know what we know as soon as we know it, and so it is with heavy hearts that we present the following information to you at this time.

Earlier today, we were alerted by a member of another subreddit that menmybabies has twice shown up on the radar over at /r/scamwatch. While we are taking no official position on this matter, we feel it is our duty to share the allegations with this community.
The /r/scamwatch threads can be viewed here: 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ScamWatch/comments/rni8b/becareful_with_menmybabies/c47bfes 

http://www.reddit.com/r/ScamWatch/comments/y94qj/im_fucking_sickened_beware_of_these_users/


You can peruse them at your leisure. To summarize briefly, many people from various subreddits and other help sites feel they have been used/scammed by this member of our community. At the suggestion of the person who first alerted us to these allegations, we contacted a former mod at /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza who was part of the initial discussion that brought these allegations to light. His response can be viewed here: http://i.imgur.com/pF8pW.png


Again, since we are unable to prove or disprove these allegations beyond a shadow of a doubt, we are not taking an official position. We are merely presenting the information we have been given so that you can all make your own decisions regarding this matter.

EDIT: No new threads on this topic will be permitted. All comments on this topic should be posted in this thread.

Then, when you are applied and it looks like my nails are covered in 1,000 tiny sequins and you go and get all flaky and chip at the first sign of stress. Even with my awesome top coat! This cannot go on any longer. AND don't even get me started on how hard you are to get off! I just keep rubbing and rubbing and rubbing until my nail beds are sore. I've tried soaking, but it's just not worth it. 

I'm sorry Glitter, but I've been seeing more and more of Shimmer these days. Shimmer treats me right. Who knows, maybe I'll see you again at Christmas time when I need an outrageous manicure for that Tacky Sweater Party. But, I wouldn't count on it.

I KNOW it's not reddit's weird little vote-balancing thing that keeps out spam because I am now in the negatives. 

I've already said I'd use redditraffle to choose at least one winner. I considered calling off the contest altogether but many people did put effort into responding and I want to give them the chance to be polished as promised. 

I know I am being picky, but I was giving my honest response to colors. Teals/greens/blues are notoriously hard to photograph, and since I had Majestic Flight sitting right there on my nails I knew what it looked like and what I wanted. What was I supposed to say? ""That color IS A PERFECT MATCH! THIS IS AWESOME! THIS IS SPOT-ON"" to every single one! Am I supposed to lie? I tried to say that some of the polishes looked awesome on their own and most of my ""well, it looks a little too blue"" or ""too green""s were not criticisms aimed at the people trying to help me, it was more frustration on my part that the color was just so unique that no undies would fit the bill.

I know I shouldn't bitch about downvotes, but this is REALLY WEIRD to me cause this is the first bit of negativity I've seen here in a while. And to be frank, I don't deserve it. I polish people. I participate nicely in discussions. I try to make people feel better when they're down and share in the polish excitement when someone gets a haul. I'm sorry I didn't lie to some of you to make you feel better. I don't know what you thought downvoting me would accomplish, but I do know I am hesitant to run another contest again after this contest and the LOTR contest are done. Good job. I'll just stick to polishing the people who are nice to me (and those are in plenty) from now on instead of broadening my spectrum to include people who may have been previously to shy to pop up in discussion but want to contribute to a contest thread.

Here is my personal take on things:

I am considerably older than most of you, not that that matters much, but it means I have more years under my belt of having endured being scammed. It happens, and it happens more to those with open and generous spirits than it does to those who are suspicious and selfish. Scammers make me furious, but less so for taking my hard earned money than for robbing me of the spirit of kindness that I try very hard to nurture. Every time I get rooked by a scam artist (and it has happened often, in all areas of my life) I spend a long while stewing over it and feeling angry and hurt. But when I do that, I let them win. It means I am giving them not just my money, but control over my thoughts and feelings. And angry and hurt is not who I am! I am someone who makes the effort to make other people happy, whether it be through compliments, actions, or gifts. It's about making the world a better place by promoting that which is positive and turning my back on that which is negative. (And believe me, it isn't easy. I suffer from bouts of clinical depression and being positive is something I often have to actively fight to achieve).  The scams I have fallen victim to have served to make me a little smarter about how I gift, but when push comes to shove and I have a choice to make about whether to make a gift or not, I cannot and will not let the fear of being scammed stop me from doing that which makes my heart swell with the joy of giving.

 If you have been one of those victimized, I will certainly understand if you are reluctant to send polish to a stranger again when there are no guarantees that anyone is who they say they are, or will follow through on any promises they make. But keep in mind that there have been *so many* beautiful bottles of polish given and received just as they are meant to. This place, this wonderful place, cannot be blighted by the reprehensible acts of one conniving thief. The friendship and generosity that illuminate this subreddit are more than adequate to snuff out the tiny little shadow that has crept into our midst. 

I have two quotes to share with you. They are my very favorites, and have stood me well through the decades. The first is ""This, too, shall pass."" No matter how heavy and dark the clouds may seem, they always do part eventually and the sun will shine again. Okra and her team of mods do a great job of steering this community in a positive direction, and I am very grateful to them for that! The second is a quote from Henry James: “Three things in human life are important: the first is to be kind; the second is to be kind; and the third is to be kind.” Be kind to one another and let's keep RAoP a place of generosity and camaraderie and fun :) 

And to try to keep it fun and keep the polish flowing, I will choose 3 people from among any comments made to receive something off your wish list!

If any of you feel that you may have trouble keeping control over your emotions or are just too angry to calm down at this time, I ask that you please refrain from posting while we deal with this.

What we pride ourselves on here is our good hearts, generous spirits and love and respect for one another. That cannot be taken away by one person, it cannot even be broken.

If you'll look to my name, you'll see the words ""Resident Scrooge"" next to it. I didn't put that there. I was dubbed the Scrooge after a long conversation with a few of our wonderful Mods when this sub was shiny and new. 

There is a story behind it.
I hang around, I give people gifts, I am slightly bitchy.
That's kind of my job around here.

It was a joke.
It has been a joke.
Until today.

My job around here is absolutely **not** to be offensive.
I am not here to make people upset.


I'm sorry if I took it too far today.

**To give a bit of a back story,**
Luckers had commented on my contest, saying her dog was cuter than mine.
Obviously, I'm a bit biased. My dog is cuter.
Then, a comment was made about how I hadn't ended my contest after almost a month. *I'm busy, sorry.*
I jokingly said ""you obviously do not know who I am."" 
Madness ensued, we exchanged words.


I clearly missed the memo.
I thought we were joking.


I, as I tend to do, told her that she won the contest simply because she had the balls to stand up to the all-mighty scrooge. (I swear guys, I thought we were joking.)


Then, today, when I ended the contest, Luckers was the winner.
**I thought everybody would get the joke.**


I thought wrong.


I am incredibly sorry for upsetting anybody.
I'm not cancelling the gift.
I'm not going to run away and hide from this sub.
*I am also not going to stop my scrooge-y ways.*


From this point forward, please understand that everything I say is all in fun. **If i ever say something that is borderline offensive, or makes somebody upset, please tell me.**


I'm sorry for causing chaos. I'm sorry for offending.

**Now, move along. There's nothing to see here.**

On another note though,  it hurts my heart to see so much arguing and dissension here over IWF. Did I let that jerk ruin my friendships and my day? No I got over it and moved on. We are on the Internet. There are gonna be fuckerheads everywhere we go. We're also going to have our own very strong opinions about how things were or are not handled. I get that. We learn,  we get smarter,  we find ways to rebuild our trust.  We shouldn't be mean to each other and downvoting everything someone writes. What does this solve? Nothing.

Are we all seriously going to let some teenage bubble gum chomping teenager bring us down and ruin friendships?? We're adults here, most of us. Let's act like it. I am ashamed at some of the behavior I'm seeing today. Would you let your children read some of the things being said? I wouldn't. People disappoint me daily. I just make a mental note and move on. I don't berate them and rehash it over and over.  If I don't agree with something or a way something is handled I leave and find people who I get along with. Negativity is hard to overcome.  It brings everyone down. This is about ONE PERSON not mods or mod helpers. So what I'm saying I guess is GET OVER IT AND MOVE ON!  I bought her lots of stuff too but I'm over it.

It's really awesome seeing all the gifted threads!!! 

Here are the rules: 
You are to gift the person above you item(s) from their wishlist totaling **$10-$15**. You may choose to spend more if you want, but $10 is the minimum. I will gift the very last person to comment! **MAKE SURE YOU SORT THE COMMENTS BY ""OLD""**. It might make this easier if you say something like ""I'm in! I'm gifting -username-"" to keep any mistakes from happening. The first person will gift me, then the next person will gift that lady and so on :) 

*You must gift when you comment*

**If you want to participate more than once, feel free, just be sure and wait until someone else comments (and gifts you) so that you may gift that person - or someone later on in the line!** I'm not putting any participation limits on this - join as much as you want, but YOU MUST GIFT!

contest ends **October 25, midnight CST** :D

I'm hoping everyone likes this contest! If you have any questions, feel free to ask :)


edit: yes the minimum amount counts with shipping :) So if your gift is $8, and shipping is $2, this is fine!

NO. You send me another coupon - 20% off my whole purchase, yay! - except your fine print now excludes *clearance merchandise*. Is this how it's gonna be, Ulta? Because sometimes your ""clearance merchandise"" ISN'T EVEN MARKED DOWN. When that China Glaze used to be $7.50 and now it's $7, that REALLY doesn't qualify as a discount. 

Edit: OH. And I forgot to mention how you stopped automatically scanning coupons for people at the register, totally screwing those of us who don't have easy access to a printer in an attempt to save yourself a few bucks. Joke's on you - I printed out multiples and came back like three times.

It's amazing to see how we have grown so much in such a short time, and have such a wonderful group here! Welcome to all our new members, and thank you to all our existing members for being so amazing! I am confident that we will become even more fabulous in the new year!

With that being said, just a few announcements and a quick reminder.

From here forward, we ask that all members please refrain from any postings offering to swap gift cards, ect. Since we are growing at such a fast pace, we must also limit anything which may open us up for scammers and the like. If you are looking to trade in a gift card, you may want to check out Cardpool.com. They appear to offer the option to trade your gift cards in electronically for an Amazon gift card, which may be helpful for many of you.

In that same realm, please be sure to remember that we are all about the joy of gifting here. While it is certainly wonderful to receive, it should never be expected. It is an unfortunate reality that we are going to experience some members popping in for a ""free gift"" but never posting or returning the love. Since we all gift at our own risk, if you prefer to only gift to those you feel are ""deserving"" or active in the community please be sure to do your due diligence. By checking a members profile or conducting a quick search you will be able to find out if they are an active member or a lurker before making your decision whether you would like to gift that person.

In addition, in order to help reduce the amount of lurkers in the community, I will be periodically checking the never been polished list and the wishlist links that appear in the randomizer and removing the wishlists of those who have never posted here before or have not posted in quite some time.

Lastly, please take a moment to familiarize yourself with the sidebar and the use of our tags. Just a quick reminder that it is not necessary to use am [OT] tag, since all topics are allowed here. Just go ahead and post away! :)

You are all amazing, and thank you to each and every one of you for being here with me. I look forward to another year with you all!",,False,self,t5_2ukje,1356742524.0,,,True,t3_15l6j7,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/15l6j7/announcements_and_a_few_reminders/,moderator

If you have a friend, a co-worker, a relative you've been at war with..consider a phone call, a letter, an email...try to be the bigger person and mend those broken ties.  Life is too short and if you don't do it now, you will regret it if you don't have the chance later.  We aren't promised tomorrow, don't take it for granted like I did.  The regret and self hate I live with day in and day out is painful as hell.  I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.  I don't want this for anyone else.  Don't make the same mistakes as me...once they die, there is no going back to fix it...it's done.  I hate and regret the way our story ended...don't let it happen to you too! &lt;3

I bought it and I don't really care for it and you can have it"" I'm sure I lit up like a Christmas tree with excitement. We talked for a little while and she complemented me on the electrify that I had on my nails from the hunger games collection and she said they had never got that in at that location. Anyway, I went back to the store today to get my new gift and in return I gave her my barely used bottle of electrify. She was so excited eventhough she didn't want to take it from me. I thought it was only fair after what she had done for me.

1352322033.0,33,self.RandomActsOfPolish,12tg6p,ANNOUNCEMENT,OkraWimprey,45,12,127,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12tg6p/announcement/,"Firstly, thank you to everyone who has managed to remain civilized and keep calm during this unfortunate IWF situation. I appreciate it more than you know. Secondly, I do want you to know that there have been no new developments. No definite solution has been reached as of yet, however, I am hoping to talk with IWF soon to discuss the options and reach an agreement on what needs to happen. When a decision has been reached, I will let the group know immediately.       

I do want you to know that I appreciate the fact that many people are attempting to come up with a solution that will please everyone. Any posts stating my ""plan"" are incorrect. I do not have a plan just yet, simply ideas that are being tossed out. A lot of possible solutions have been presented to me, and it goes without saying that each person/group that has presented a suggestion believes their idea is best and should be chosen immediately. While some seem to think this is something that can be decided at the snap of a finger it simply is not. Each possible solution has pros and cons that I need to consider before I can make an official judgement on what would be best for the group as a whole.

For those that disapprove of the timing of my previous announcement, as always, there was a certain way things needed to be said and presented to the group to minimize the shock and windfall of this situation. Knowing that I was not going to be available for an extended period of time Tuesday, I did not feel that Monday was the best time to present this unfortunate information in its entirety to the group. Based on the fact that I would be gone working an 18 hour day Tuesday without any sleep the night before, I did not think it would be a wise decision to drop a bomb on everyone then have to disappear leaving the group confused and upset. Unfortunately, against my better judgement I had no choice but to do this since she was going to be exposed on another subreddit and out of respect I did want to make sure that you all heard from me first.

As I predicted, based on the timing of my post, many of you now have been left confused without hearing any updates/information from me since Monday. This is exactly what I was trying to avoid. I do not appreciate certain claims that I ""planned to leave you open to be scammed for 2 more days"". This statement is simply untrue and exactly why I planned on providing a post asking all members to put a hold on all gifting until Wed while things were sorted out. This would have allowed for an official post to be provided on Wednesday which would have included all of the information as well as the agreed upon solution, therefore avoiding all of the confusion. It is unfortunate that some members took things upon themselves to provide false information and rile the group up unnecessarily.

While some members seem to feel an announcement should have been made the very second I was able to confirm she was guilty, this simply is not logical. What many have not considered is the fact that IFW was extremely involved in assisting with behind the scenes work of this subreddit and would have had to ability to wipe this place clean if exposed too early. Once I did my investigation and verified it was her, it was not as simple as just making an announcement outing her, although I wish that it was. Passwords needed to be changed, email addresses needed to be reclaimed, spreadsheets needed to be recreated, access to certain elements needed to be revoked and all of it needed to be done swiftly and in tandem. Trust me when I say that this was no easy task, and quite a bit of work. 

Many members have been betrayed by the actions of IWF, and have had their trust broken as a result. I do believe this is one isolated incident based on the fact that this was carried out via a ""polish chain"" which presented the expectation for those who polished IWF to believe they would be receiving an item in return. In our normal day to day activities, this is not the case. Typically, our caring and generous members give what they can afford to give to others randomly, with no reciprocation expected. This is what makes RandomActsOfPolish such a wonderful and special place. While I know that we would all like to believe those we polish randomly are ""deserving"" so to speak, the reality is that some may be, and unfortunately some may not. This is a risk we all take when gifting to online friends and strangers. The upside is the joy we receive from knowing that we did something wonderful for someone else, whether they truly deserve it or not. As long as all we expect in return is our own joy from selfless acts then we will all remain fulfilled.

In addition, I would like to remind everyone that what we pride ourselves on here is our good hearts, generous spirits and love and respect for one another. That cannot be taken away by one person, it cannot even be broken. This was proven by how quickly the entire group came together to help polish those that were effected. I refuse to allow the hurtful actions of one person to change everything we are about and everything we are known for. Trust me, this is one big dark cloud but I hope you can also trust me that there will be ONE GIANT silver lining as we come together stronger than ever.

**EDIT: The other mods and I have decided that the best conclusion to this fiasco is to let each person involved deal with IWF directly in order to rectify the situation. IWF has agreed that those affected by her actions can get in touch with her directly and work out what is best for each individual person. Her public apology is expected soon.**

I know this seems harsh. But I want to polish people outside my normal little circle of friends here and I've been seeing a lot of negativity around here that makes me not want to do it.

Don't make me call off the contest.

The contest will run through 3/17/13, I will polish the winners on 3/18.

A few things:

- You can only enter once even if you're a dazzling super star and polish several people.

- Contest starts today, so even if you polished somebody earlier this Sunday you can still post the link here and enter.

- If you want, list a few special items that you want on your wishlist just in case you win!

Unfortunately, they both had to be permanently removed--leaving me with really ugly feet.

It's summer now, and I see all the really cute girls with sandals and brightly colored toenails and glitter, and it's depressing to look down at my feet and not feel confident enough to wear open-toed shoes.

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this, but I know I'm not alone in being big toenail-less.

I found those fake nails that you can glue on your regular toenails; and they're even meant for toes, so you're not gluing fingernails on your toes, which is weird. But the glue, to be honest, sucks. It doesn't stick to skin, at all, and can really irritate your nail beds. So that's not really an option for the long term.

Recently, my boyfriend's mother gave me **[New Skin Bandage Spray](http://www.vitacost.com/new-skin-liquid-bandage-spray-antiseptic-1-fl-oz/?prSrching=0)**. It's a liquid bandage that comes in spray form, and just happens to be insanely sticky when first applied.

Just spray some on your toes (a decent amount) and then apply the toenail. Press down for about thirty seconds, and voila!

I tried it with my toenails (and there's no chance for fungus or anything disgusting because this is meant for your skin and locking out moisture), and it holds up pretty decently in water. I applied mine on Sunday and it's now Tuesday. Pretty decent results. The fake nails will feel extremely soft at first, but don't take them off! Be gentle with them for a few hours and they harden up into regular, normal nails.

I know that this subreddit is mostly for manicures and polish, but I wanted to get this information out there to girls who don't have the prettiest feet. It's summer and we should all get to wear sandals.

As a side note, I'm wearing Revlon's Minted on my toes with gold glitter sandals and it's the best thing ever.

Really, ever.

First and foremost up today we wanted to let you know that we've started looking at all the staff applications (there were *quite* a few) and will be choosing a couple folks (yes, more than one!) within the next couple of days. I can't stress enough that **this takes time**, so please be patient! 

Next up, I've been sick the past week or so and *may* have missed a few folks that belong on the calendar for contests. If you are one of these people, please post here or contact me and we'll get that squared away. I apologize in advance for anyone who got left off. That said, **we have a crap ton of contests ending tomorrow, so get over there and enter those if you haven't already!**

Last but not least, we wanted to offer the invitation for you all to air any grievances you may have in a civil, productive fashion. Put differently, **we want to know what you want to get out of RAOP and what you think deserves attention.** Any posts that are not a shining example of propriety will be nuked. We need to discuss, as a community, what needs to be fixed here, but the only way we're going to achieve that is if everyone can engage in civil discourse with one another.

So if you have an issue or something you think deserves attention, please post it here. I'll try to update this post with a running list of suggestions/thoughts/etc so that we can keep a list.

Please just know that we likely can't address *every* issue (especially if someone really wants us to bake lemon cupcakes in the next 2 hours, that just ain't gonna happen) and **it will take us some time**. I know a week may seem like forever in internet years, but until we hire more mods there *are* just four of us and we're all quite busy when not redditing.

SO STEP RIGHT UP. Leave your polite feedback, let me know what contests need to be added, and for the love of polish, please leave the throwaways at the door. If you have something that you REALLY do not feel comfortable bringing up publicly, you can PM me or another mod.

PEACE.

###Suggestions, Issues, Etc.
