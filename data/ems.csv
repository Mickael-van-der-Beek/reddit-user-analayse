My partner and I had an arrest several weeks ago that we got ROSC on. Found out today it went from the ""resuscitation"" category to the ""save"" category, because he was discharged today! He is still somewhat recovering but is expected to have little to no deficits. 

The long version of the arrest was initially called for arm pain, ambulance only response. En route we got upgraded to a priority response (with the first responder fire department toned out) because the pt was now seizing. As we pulled up, our dispatch advised that CPR instructions are being given. 

We walk in to find the daughter giving CPR on the couch. Get him to the floor and get to work. CPR while we get the pads on, then monitor shows VF. We shock and my partner takes CPR while I drop an OPA and take ventilations. A couple minutes later we give the 2nd shock because he is still in VF. Fire department arrives and they take over CPR while my partner gets an IV and I intubate the pt. 1st dose of epi goes in and now it is time for the 3rd shock. CPR resumes but now he starts gasping. Not sure if its agonal or the start of real respirations we stop and see he is now in Sinus Tach and has a palpable carotid. A minute or so later he starts to breathe on his own at about 6/min. We package him up, run a 12-Lead (nothing real indicative), and transport. When we dropped him off, he had a good pressure (130/80 ish), was breathing spontaneously at about 22/min, but still showed no purposeful movement and had no problem with the tube. We cleared and the only thing I had heard since was that he was moved to the ICU. 

This was my 3rd resusc but the first one I thought had an actual chance of leaving the hospital. It is a great feeling. It is easy to get wrapped up in all the stubbed toe calls, but man this feels great!",,False,,t5_2rmg0,False,,,True,t3_1gk3ex,http://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/1gk3ex/my_first_save/,

Let me start by saying that I know we all bitch.  Everyone.  I don't care if it's Ricky Rescue or Retired Randy, everyone will bitch about a patient at some point because they shouldn't have called.

But when grandma calls at 2 AM because her ""belly hurts"" and you know it's because she ate too much Mexican food, why do you treat her badly or get deeply mad, even after the call is over?

Our purpose isn't just to go in and ""save lives.""  If that was the case, then I must be in the wrong area because 99% of the time I'm not going into a life threatening situation.  But the patients who call us because they are scared, regardless of how ""BS"" we think it is, they still need us.  An emergency to them isn't always an emergency to us.

We have a duty to be the patient's advocate.  Whether that means pumping on their chest for 15 minutes or just telling the nurse that they are cold so they get more blankets, we need to act for our patients.  Whenever I go to a restaurant, the waiter doesn't bitch when I ask for no ice in my cup.  And what would we say if the waiter did bitch?  We would say that it's their job and they get paid for it.

Well guess what, guys?  We get paid for it.  So if you don't see it as a duty, see it as your fucking job.  There is literally no excuse in the world for bad patient care because you don't think that it's a true emergency.

Smiling and holding the old lady's hand will go a lot longer way than a pep talk telling her to just take some damn Tums and convince her not to go in to the ED.  They have triage for a reason.

Make her feel better.  Don't make the patient afraid or hesitant to call again in the future, when it *is* a true emergency, but they don't want to call because last time those mean ambulance drivers told her off.

And don't slack on patient care because you think someone is abusing the system.  When you run 1,000 calls a year where the patient is in 15/10 pain, and you know they want drugs, what if you're wrong just once?  That 1 out of 1,000 where they really needed the stronger dose.  Addicts are going to find a way to get their fix anyway, so you might as well ensure that they are getting it safely by you doing it.

Sorry for the rant, I'm just tired of hearing people bitch.

Make no mistake, we have a very dangerous profession that can end careers and lives. 
We sometimes take safety for granted in EMS. The reality is though, that every scene, every patient, and every intersection you drive through has the potential to be deadly. Stay aware, keep your eyes open and stay safe everyone.

Now I've only been licensed for 2 months now and I've only had one legitimate call while at work, so I was scared shitless. I did CPR for 8 minutes with 3 shocks before the fire department arrived..... Just got word about an hour ago that she survived. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel about this. Of course I'm very happy that she survived, but I still feel really down. When the paramedics took over I looked over and she looked like a rag doll and I can't get that image out of my head.

It is always online (via 3G or wifi) so it can retrieve anything that a regular device can.   Most demos include ""ok glass, record a video""  and obviously that has nearly zero benefit to EMS.

But what if you could pick up a patients bottle of prescription meds and say ""ok glass, what is Lamictal?"" and it would display the info.   ""Ok Glass display vitals"" and it would sync the bp, spo2, pulse, ETCO2 from the LP15.   ""ok Glass, pushing D50 now"" and it would save that as an event either tagged in the LP15, or to a pcr system.   

""ok glass, record narrative 'upon arrival we found a 66 year old male seated on the couch in no apparent distress....'""  Speech to text then records that in your pcr.

Mass casualty triage as you are walking through a scene ""ok glass, add two patients...   add 1 patient..... add three patients""

""OK glass, order more BVMs"" or just look at the barcode and a message is sent to your supply person to place the order

on the way back to quarters at 3 am ""ok glass, where is the nearest chinese takeout that is still open?""
   
I'm not saying all this is doable (although I think it is).   I have a feeling a lot of people will dismiss glass as a gimmick (and not just for ems).  Don't.    This is seriously a game changer.  Initially, it will just be people recording and exchanging goofy videos.   But it will mature and find truly productive applications.  Including in EMS.

Patient complaining of abdominal pain. We go out and find this guy laying on a mattress in the floor. Abdomen significantly distended and rigid, pain upon palpation, pitting pedal edema. Oh he also has a sack the size of a grapefruit, not his normal. Our local bandaid station isn't going to take care of this, so I decide with the deputies and the patient that he needs to go to the university medical center up the road about half an hour. So the Deputy tells us they'll send a vehicle to tail us and keep us safe. All goes swimmingly, we continue on our way and I treat the patient. 

About 10 minutes out my partner, the driver, notices that the deputy has stopped tailing us. He didn't mention anything because he didn't want to make a situation. About the time that we pull into the ER, dispatch calls us to notify us that our patient has been released from custody while we were en route. Even though he still had ~3 months left on his sentence. The deputy just turned around and went back to the detention center. All of my patient's belongings were still at jail, he didn't sign any paperwork, we weren't notified. We wtf'd for a good little bit, and eventually told the patient what happened. Luckily, he was a nonviolent offender and an overall nice guy. He was mad too, because he immediately identified something I didn't. They dumped him so they didn't have to pay his medical bills. According to the ER nurse, jails do this kind of thing all the time. 

Anybody have any similar experiences? Seems incredibly scummy of them to do. I'll be talking with my director today to see what can be done about this moving forward. Even if they want to do this crap, they shouldn't be placing us in harm's way for their bottom line.

&gt;Good Morning

&gt;This original request was sent from Sgt. Robert Carpenter - Public Information Officer of the Virginia State Police, Division VI, (I have his phone number) who received a request from another officer that a friend of his who is a life-saving member in Bedford County said that a 6 year old boy from Rustburg, Va is sadly dying of terminal cancer and might not live to see Christmas. His special request is to receive Christmas cards from police officers, firefighters and EMS personnel.

&gt;The request then came to Chief James Seavey from Wesley Melson who is a volunteer Chief of Colonial Beach Rescue Squad and a career personal in Va. and then from Chief Seavey to me.

&gt;Besides a card, a patch would be a thrilling addition to give to this little boy.

&gt;In this time of remembering our blessings and of giving I can think of nothing more appropriate then to give this little boy some happiness and our prayers.

&gt;Please quickly send to

This will sound more morose than I intend it to- or perhaps exactly as morose as I intend,  but there are times when I’m in the back of the truck and I’m watching the cardiac monitor and it feels like I’m watching my life slip away with the patient’s. Just one beat at a time. It’s worse when there’s no chance at improvement for the patient. When I’m serving my time as a goat herder- ushering a demented little old lady who’s blind and deaf and requires artificial nutrition to stay alive. In those times it’s hard to feel like there’s a real purpose behind the job- that this is really a calling. Sometimes it feels more like a prison sentence. “You are hereby ordered to witness the slow death of 300 individuals per year. You will maintain what is cynically referred to as comfort measures, and extend these lives despite many good reasons not to. May God have mercy on your soul.”


I’m watching this lady’s husband tell her to stay calm, and that all of this is to help, and it just feels like a lie. Rather- it is a lie. This isn’t to help her. There is no helping her. Her brain has atrophied past the point where any meaningful interaction is possible. She’s receiving treatment for a raging UTI (her third in as many months), and we’re about to cut off her leg since her peripheral vascular disease has reached the point of no return and the skin around her foot has begun to spontaneously die. His words of assurance and calming are for himself. Convincing himself that his desire to hold on for just a bit longer is only due to love and not fear. That her case is different, and she’s about to turn the corner. That letting a surgeon cut off the lower portion of her legs is completely justified because he’ll have one more day. I know the truth. I know that this lady will in all likelihood never come off the ventilator she’ll be placed on for surgery. If she survives the procedure at all she’ll live out her few remaining days in the ICU with an endotracheal tube shoved into her airway.

 
We’ve arrived at the new hospital. The place (in all likelihood) that this lady will die. Far from home. Missing part of her legs. Hooked to machines, and tubes, and completely unaware of the decisions being made on her behalf. With my willing participation. She's agitated now from the movement of transport, so I give her a little bit of Ativan. This is the life this lady gets to live in her final days. A nameless stranger who you won't remember- sedating you as you scream in the back of a vehicle taking you to a place you can't name. 


I don't mean to suggest that it's never worth it. I know what it is to truly save a life- to bring someone back from the very brink or even just beyond. It's just that it's so rare, and it so often feels like we're doing more harm than good. We set out to heal the world and end up just letting wounds fester into gangrene. 


Tomorrow I'll go back. And I'll be in the back of the truck again, and maybe this time I'll make something positive happen. Maybe my hands will heal and revive, rather than maintain and sustain- but I truly have little faith.

My partner and I get tapped out for a male pt, not alert. We respond hot there per EMD coding. THe first responder fire department gets there first, reports full arrest, begins BLS resuscitation efforts. On arrival we find the pt in the bathroom, pulseless and apneic, with no shock advised on FD's AED. 

We hook him up to our monitor and start working him with standard ACLS algorithm. Asystole, so nothing special about the arrest. It is workable, he had less than 10 minutes down time, was still warm, etc. 

THis is where it got weird. THe niece runs into the room and tells us that the pt's wife is hyperventilating. So I send a firefighter to go check on her while we package the pt. (Yes I know it is more viable to work on scene but our protocols haven't caught up to the rest of the country yet). Firefighter yells back to us that the lady had passed out. So we call for a second transport unit. THey are only a couple minutes away. The firefighters get the lady on oxygen make sure her airway is open, everything looks good. 

As soon as the second unit gets there, we take another firefighter and off we go to the hospital. Well not three minutes after being there the second unit calls another full arrest on the radio. Call for another engine company and they transport her. 

Turns out she was in a VF to PEA to Asystole kind of arrest. Even the ED docs were pretty flabbergasted. No one had ever encountered a husband and wife arresting in such a close timeframe, essentially together. Keep in mind that both were relatively young and in moderately okay health. No major cardiac or respiratory stuff for either, no cancer, etc. 

Both ended up being called in the ED by the docs after being worked for awhile. It was a strange and remarkable experience. ",,False,,t5_2rmg0,False,,,True,t3_16opmg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/16opmg/cardiac_arrest_x2/,

1348509588.0,44,self.ems,10eif8,Today I saw quite possibly the most egregious breach of patient care I've ever seen.,crash_over-ride,47,3,165,http://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/10eif8/today_i_saw_quite_possibly_the_most_egregious/,"I was working as a full-time Paramedic in Upstate NY until two months ago, when I left fulltime EMS in order to pursue a non-EMS job that will hopefully help with my goal of going to grad school in a few years.  I moved to a small town in a rural county near New York State's Capital Region, and I joined this town's all volunteer ambulance squad.  

They do things differently from what I'm used to, very differently (for example, on average it takes the ambulance 6-9 minutes to get out, and we are required to wait that length for people to show up).  Today there was a dispatch for a man in his 40's who fell off of a roof, and it was near my work so I went right to the scene and arrived before anyone else.  He was CAOx3 and supine on the ground with multiple head lacerations, had a witnessed fall from a roof of about 10 feet with a less-than-clear recollection of what had happened.  He was also complaining of back pain, and stated he had injured it before.  He also thought that Clinton was the president, and had no idea of the day of the week.  

One of his co-workers had holding c-spine, so I applied a C-Collar from my jump-bag, took a set of vitals, and did a head to toe physical exam.  The ambulance arrived, and so did a county paramedic.  They made no effort to convince him to go to the hospital, successfully dissuading him and reassuring him that his wish to visit his chiropractor was a good idea.  They sat him up, removed the C-Collar I had applied, didn't bother patching up the lacerations, and all they did was flush his eyes with a Morgan's Lense.  

In my almost seven years in EMS, this perhaps might be the worst thing I've ever seen, in terms of egregious violations of patient care standards (it may not surprise you that most of the other 'most egregious things' I've seen have been within the past 2 months in this same county).  I still can't wrap my head around what I've seen, and am thinking about giving up EMS for the time being.  The Captain of the ambulance squad has no interest in getting me credentialed to practice ALS in this region, with his exact words being ""we don't really need another Paramedic.""  It should be noted that there is only one active Paramedic in this agency, namely the Captain. My job prohibits outside employment, so my only EMS outlets are the local volunteer squad, and an agency I volunteer with that's about 90 miles away (I put in the occasional weekend).

Guy had lost it and hut the guard rail at about 50mph.  That happened at about 4PM and I did nothing for the rest of the evening.  I even slept all night long, pretty much from midnight until this morning at 7am when tones drop:

""Chest pain, sweating, says he feels weak""

Walk into the house and the guy is pouring sweat and says his chest hurts substernal and radiates into his arm, 8/10 on pain scale, sudden onset while walking outside with his coffee, ""Feels like someones standing on my heart!"". No need to waste time on scene with this guy, we load him up and I grab a very quick EKG in the back of my truck.  No ST elevation that I can see, probable LBBB, our protocols are to treat the LBBB as MI until proven otherwise. I started my IV and got a drip hanging, gave him 324mg aspirin and then after I had my IV, EKG confirmations, and blood pressure (224/110) I gave one nitro SL. Next thing I know he's seized up and cardiac arrest.  Shocked once and one round of CPR and he's looking up at me and tracking my voice when I ask him to.  By the time I left the hospital he was a/ox4, answered all questions appropriately and has no deficit.  It was a hell of a late run that's to be sure. 

I wanted to A. Share my first save with Reddit.  B: Ask if anyone would have done something differently.  I'm happy with my treatment plan, I'm not happy that he arrested but I felt like I treated my patient appropriately and with the right cautions.  I've spoken with the ER doc, and the doc my wife works for (a cardiothoracic surgeon) and both seem to think that I did all I could with my given tools.  

Last but not least here are my EKG's, sorry for the quality it's a copy of a copy :P

1320717171.0,43,self.ems,m49j0,"I finally earned a stork pin, after only two years in EMS..",zombieron,50,7,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/m49j0/i_finally_earned_a_stork_pin_after_only_two_years/,"I have friends and co-workers who have been in EMS for 20+ years and have never had the honor of delivering a baby. I had the cherished honor recently, and while maintaining the patient's privacy rights, I would like to share my experience with you...

Roughly 16 hours into my 48 hour shift, around 10:30 pm we get toned for mutual aid call into another town for a women in third term with crowning. We get to the scene and find our mom-to-be on her bathroom floor, in the birthing position and she was crowning roughly 3 inches. En route we discussed a load and go to have every care possible at the hospital for the delivery but when we arrived it was clear that the baby was coming and we had to deliver there. Dad was on the phone panicking and calling everyone he knew to tell them the news. I am a EMT-Basic with 2 years and over 500 calls under my belt with some of the best and worst scenarios you can find in this business. My partner was a 3 year Intermediate and the crew chief for our truck. When he saw the scene he got pale and I knew that I had to jump in and get this going. This is not a slight to his skills in anyway but I think that it was as new to him as it was to me but I helped deliver my own two children and had more experience I guess as far as preparedness.

I took the helm and got down to catching level. Mom was lying down in her small bathroom with her legs toward the door. My only position was in the doorway. There was no room to be comfortable and no time to change things. Talked to mom and got her to control her breathing. She was breathing and pushing erratically. I tried calming her down. She told me it hurt and she just wanted the baby out. I told her that if she breathes on with me and pushes when I say so, we will have this baby soon and hopefully with less complication. She complies, breathes on schedule, pushes on schedule and within 5 minutes the head pushes through. I can visualize the neck and check it for any umbilical involvement and we are good.

I tell mom that we can't stop now, take a deep breath and give me one big push, we are almost there. With a deep inhale and a bigger push the baby popped out, fluids and all. My partner reaches in with the syringe and suctions mouth then nose. (we discussed it later and I suggested that next time its nose first then mouth), hands me a clean towel and I begin to dry the baby as well as stimulate it. I clean as much as I can off and change towels. I wrap baby tightly and continue to try to stimulate. Baby is not responding as much as we like. I rub stimulate more, rub and flick the feet and we have crying. Mom was freaking to this point but was now relieved, as we all were. Baby was crying, has motor function and was getting color in it's skin. The cord is clamped and cut.

Minutes later mom delivers her placenta and we make our way to the hospital. Baby is alert, healthy and now feeding.

This was an amazing experience without question. I can't help but to think how awful it would have been if there were complications or even a stillbirth. But luckily it wasn't. We all walked away very happy.

So that's my story. Many people in our work never get the chance. Last year with me on CPR, our crew saved a life, this year I delivered life. I feel very lucky.

I realizes these things vary person to person, region to region. I apologize in advance for my poorly written and planned rant.

I've recently changed my thought process about the ""scene safety"" aspect of our job. In school the mantra ""scene safety, BSI"" gets drilled into your head. We come to learn that if a scene isn't safe, we don't enter. Makes sense, right? Fire, assaults, Hazmat etc. are all obvious signs to not be there. But depending on where you work, is a scene ever ""safe""?

We stage for a psych. He's in his mothers house flailing a hammer around like a blacksmith. A 2 man cruiser responds with us. They make entry in front of us. Both of them are in the kitchen talking to the patient. Patients friend storms in the front door behind us and starts making a ruckus about whatever the hell he's yelling about and smashing lamps and shit. 2 cops on scene, scenes safe right? They're on scene, but can only focus on one thing at a time. In this case its MC Hammer who's off his meds.

One more on PD. Dispatched for the active assault. We stage down the block and wait till PD clears the scene safe. We're a good distance away, what can go wrong? Turns out the assailant fled the scene PTA and found the ambulance. He knocks on the passenger window and tells my partner he's having chest pain (normal for this city). Looks like just another guy looking for a ride to the hospital. Partner gets out to see whats going on and the guy starts trying to choke him. We call immediate PD assistance, and I get to work getting the psycho off my buddy. We were far enough away the residence that anyone would assume to be out of the hot zone. We let our guard down, like assholes, and assumed we were fine.

Dispatched to a diff breather. No Hx of any respiratory illness. We go in, chicks sitting in a recliner with audible wheezes. Alright, neb time. But what the fuck smells like bleach? I poke around a little as my partner sets up the treatment. We walked into an active meth lab. We drag the patient out of the house by her shirt, call PD and FD for a Hazmat. 

These are just a few recent experiences I've had. In my opinion, there is no such thing as scene safety. Scene awareness is the best we can do in the streets. In school we learn to identify tons illnesses, we can treat different problems with a range of interventions. We adapt to think under the stress of patients getting sicker and sicker slowly getting closer to the light. But we spend little time, at least where I was taught, on how to recognize when a scene assumed safe, according to the caller and dispatch, is a danger zone. It is inevitably a lesson that has to be learned by experiencing it first hand. But unfortunately that means mistakes, possibly fatal ones, are going to be made. 

According to the Dept. of Labor, death statistics for EMS personnel are right on par with fire and police. But during schooling our focus is 100% on patient care after the first month or so. We learn ""PD is on scene, must be safe lets go have a look.""

My rant boils down to this. Teaching ""scene safety"" isn't beneficial to our field anymore. PD can only do so much for us and we can't rely on them 100%. Don't get me wrong, its great they're there and they do a lot for us. I'm also not saying we need to be armed or anything like that. More emphasis has to be put scene awareness and less on assuming someone else is going to protect us. But we can't just assume someplace in a sketchy part of town isn't safe and refuse to help a patient. Our job has inherent dangers and we know that when we start.

As I'm writing this, I'm realizing that what I was going to propose is impossible. All I can say is that ""scene safety"" is a lie. Any patient can become violent at any point for no reason. Everywhere you go could potentially be home for a hungry person on bath salts. That suicidal patient who is ""unarmed"" might just have a knife in their pocket. Scene awareness and never getting complacent are the only options we have. Assumptions will get you hurt or worse. 

So stay safe out there, and watch each others backs. Because when it comes down to it, we have no one to rely on except the person sitting next to you. ",,False,,t5_2rmg0,False,,,True,t3_v9xwg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/v9xwg/scene_safety/,

I recently started volunteering with my local FD. Last night was my first time irl ventilating, giving CPR, and seeing a dead person (besides seeing my grandmother at her funeral). The pt didn't make it. I must say, it is a heck of a lot different than it is on a mannequin. 
I am strangely ok. I thought I'd be way more upset after my ""first time"". I teared up a bit on the drive home, but it was more from the build-up of excitement and adrenalin, I think. The one thing that I found slightly hard was her eyes. She wasn't in there, but she was staring at me as I was bagging her. My mantra just became ""breathe 2 3 4 5 6, breathe 2 3 4 5 6"". I think that the paramedic I was with knew she wasn't coming back, and maybe that's why he let me do compressions, but I must say, it kind of sucks to be the person who has to stop CPR. I stopped so the AED could analyze, and just looked around for them to tell me to start again. After a few seconds I whispered, ""are we done?"" And the paramedic nodded. 
It was a wild experience. I'm proud of myself though. I was professional, did what I was taught, and I know there was nothing that could've been done any differently that could've changed the outcome.

We're not on scene more than a minute before we take a few steps back, as it's evident he's not going to step back onto the porch, and he lets himself go.  At about 300 pounds, he hits the earth HARD landing on grass.  His body collapsed under him, landing like a paratrooper.  This landing, coupled with being drunk as a skunk (and therefore, not bracing himself) allowed him to escape with relatively minor injuries.  Still... crazy thing to witness.

Motorcycle vs. fresh deer carcass.  That was a pretty one.  Unresponsive on scene, came to before we got her on board, substantial abdominal injuries.

Also there's the apneic heroin OD who was being resuscitated in one room, while his girlfriend is showing off her dance moves for the police and other crewmembers on a rudimentary stripper pole she had installed in the living room.

Hopefully the newer EMT's (like me) can learn a thing or two by sharing some observations and comments. Sorry if this post gets really long.

Dispatched midafternoon for 62 Female with Chest Pain. Arrive on scene (BLS only while waiting for medic) and find slightly heavy-set woman conscious &amp; alert x4, sitting on edge of bed. Pt appears slightly pale, appears to have some very minor resp distress. Patient states ""I feel pressure in my chest"" substernal and complains of some ""tightness"" as well. I asked if she had pain anywhere else and she stated pain was radiating to her jaw. Placed pt on NRB @ 15lpm. Unable to get a radial, brachial, or carotid pulse. Unable to auscultate a blood pressure. Listened to her heart with stethoscope and heard pulse of ~60 but very faint (didn't sound like a normal, strong heart beat). Intitial resp of 24, slightly distressed. Pt appeard quite anxious asking ""what's happening to me"" but also stated ""I don't want to have to go to the hospital.
History: No cardiac history or medical conditions, no meds, no allergies. Hysterectomy 7 years prior. Her mother, however, had open heart surgery 4 months prior so family cardiac history present. 
Medic arrives on scene after about 5 minutes. He goes to get set up in the rig and we assist pt onto stretcher b/c we wanted to load and go at this point. This is where it gets interesting.

Right after we get her on stretcher and moving towards the ambulance she now states ""I feel really dizzy, I think I'm gonna pass out."" Not twenty seconds later I notice her head fall to the side and her eyes roll back. Respirations were what I would call ""snoring respirations"" but later find out this is actually agonal resps. I quickly lowered the stretcher to fully flat and we boogied into the ambulance. In the ambulance medic realizes this is now a full code and has the other EMT start compressions while I get BVM set up and he attaches the pads to his lifepak. Initial rhythmn of V-Fib so he charges to 360J and we shock once. I take over compressions while OPA is placed and other EMT bags. We go enroute lights and sirens. Medic pushes 1st round of epi, pt still V-fib, 2nd shock delivered. 3 more shocks are delivered (total of 5) and I believe 4 rounds of epi and 1 round of Amiodarone are pushed by the medic in total. After 5th shock pt started moving and had spontaneous eye movement. Medic checked the rhythm and no longer V-Fib. Faint carotid pulse is felt and pt breathing on own so we assisted her in breathing with BVM. We're about 2 mins out from hospital at this point. As wheeling her in I got the pt to squeez my hand and open her eyes when asked. Care transferred to the hospital staff. The END.

I just found out today that she coded at the hospital again and ""fully"" died this time. Anyways couple of thoughts/comments/reflection:
1. ALWAYS BE PREPARED for things to go South. This was just a ""typical"" chest pain patient to me and I wasn't expecting a full arrest. So always be ready for the pt to code. 
2. Agonal respirations are not respirations. The person has coded (or at least respiratory arrested) at that point. I initially thought she was ""still breathing."" I didn't realize til afterwards that the beginning of the arrest was actually in the house. 
3. Remember number one. No patient is typical.
4. Even if you've done almost everything right and had the patient obeying command after ROSC, they still might not make it. It sucks. But it's life. Being the last person a patient talked to before they died is a weird feeling. 

If you actually read this whole thing I'd be amazed and thank you for that. Just wanted to share my experience about a witnessed arrest as they are rather unusual. I felt much better about this second code than I did about my first. Everything ran much smoother, probably because there were way less people on scene (not 20 firefighters) and most of it happened in the back of the ambulance. It was much, much more controlled. Stay safe out there. 

EDIT: I'm a dumbass. Meant history of hysterectomy. Sorry about that.

Running code through town, trying to keep the patient stable, and I whip out my handy-dandy phone and call in to the ALS line.

""Herp Hospital, this is Derp Ambulance X-Derp-12, ALS inbound, 10-minute ETA. On board I have an X-year-old female, possible CVA. This will be a direct admit from Derpington Hospital. Patient's initials are [NATO standard phonetics], going to room whatever under the care of Doctor So-and-So. Are you aware of this patient?""

Pause. Twenty seconds.

""We're calling the floor.""

""Good copy.""

*Silence* for two minutes. I am still on the line.

""Herp Hospital, this is Derp Ambulance X-Derp-12, do you copy?""

*Silence*, except for the 'beep' of the timer as the line continues to record the conversation (or lack thereof).

We are almost to the hospital.

""Herp Hospital, do you do have questions or orders for me?""

Still nothing. We are pulling onto the hospital campus. I can see our cherries lighting up the walls of the ED. I realize I have no idea what to do in this situation, but remember that I'm connected to a recorded line, so I'd better say something.

""No copy. We have arrived at your facility. Terminating connection. Derp X-Derp-12 clear.""

We whip it around and sail backwards into the loading bay. I see an awkward penguin in a white lab coat standing behind the rig. My partner puts it in park, walks to the back, and converses with her. She goes back inside as he opens the back doors.

He tells me, ""That was the tech that was monitoring the line. She said she walked away to grab pizza, and when she came back, you had hung up. But the floor knows we're coming.""

I work in one of the top 10 most dangerous cities in America. Cops are there to back us up when they can be, but most of the time no units are available. 

Anyway, ""Man down in the street"" quickly turned into ""raging asshole high on meth"". Pt was about 6'2"", 240 lbs male. I'm 5'11"", 180 lbs male. My partner, 5'4"", 90 lbs soaking wet female (new basic). She managed to get cornered in an alleyway by this guy. I hit the magic orange button, gave our location, and moved in to hopefully wrap the guy up. Long story short my partner ducked out of the way of his screwdriver, and I took this guy down hard. I ended up breaking his left arm when he was swinging a screwdriver that came out of nowhere and got punch in the ribs twice. Cops were on scene about 45 seconds after I called a may-day. We had to put him in 4 point restraints, chemically restrain him as well as the backboard sandwich.

As EMS workers, I know you guys are on the roads all day/night and would be forever thankful if you could keep a lookout for the car. also, if you could share this with all of your other EMS friends we would be doubly thankful!



Update: Potential sighting in Davis Creek, CA- they could be heading to Idaho so that the car blends in. This is no longer just a California cry for help. Anyone out west between CA and Idaho please help us!

UPDATE: This car may have been spotted in bakersfield,CA at 9pm saturday, oct 6th (last night) so they may be headed South toward Mexico! Socal EMS workers, we need you!

This is based on a call I had a few months ago. All necessary sacrifices to the HIPPA gods have been made. 


You and your basic partner are dispatched at 2230 to a mobile home park for ""a woman with a severe headache"". Your response time is 10 mins.


You knock on the door and a woman opens it. She is around 100 kg, around 55 years old. She is ambulating under her own power. Her breathing is slightly labored, and her skin is flushed and a little diaphoretic.  she sits down on the couch and tells you this story:


""I started feeling funny yesterday. Just like something wasn't right. My blood pressure was really high. Then this afternoon I started having this throbbing headache. Its the worst of my life. I'm also feeling dizzy and nauseous.""


O- She was sitting watching TV when her H/A began. 
P- She reports no provoking or palliating factors. 
Q- She describes the pain as ""throbbing"". 
R- It is primarily in her occipital region. 
S- 9/10
T-The pain began this afternoon around 1300, but pain became much worse an hour ago, prompting her to call 911. 
U- This has never happened to her before. 


Your partner obtains the following vital signs on scene


GCS 15 with no AMS. 
Pulse 50 S/R at radial bilat. 
RR 20 no longer labored after she sat down. 
B/P 300+/220 (The gauge on your BP cuff only goes up to 300). 
sp02 90 on RA. 


You notice some pill bottles on her shelf, and ask ""Are these all of your medications?"" she replies ""Yes, thats all of them"" they include


Metoprolol, 
lisinopril, 
clonidine (you notice the bottle is empty), 
Metformin, 
Levothyroxine.


What else would you like to know? What is your impression of this pt? What is her transport priority? What is your treatment plan? I'll be able to answer questions for the next few hours, and I'll put up my solution in a few days.


Edit: In addition to the 12 lead below, Im putting up this [crappy cellphone picture](http://i.imgur.com/30RUr.jpg) of lead 2 in the same pt. The rhythm is much more apparent.


**Edit 2** : Thanks for playing everyone! Thanks in particular to adenocard for the great explanation of clonodine action and withdrawal. I chose this run because I thought it showed an interesting pathology, and a classic example of an unusual heart rhythm. I made an attempt to follow up with this pt but was ultimately unable to, so I dont have an ""answer"" to give anyone. But i'll type up my interpretation.

Like many of you, I suspected that this pts hypertension was a result of her running out of, and subsequently withdrawing from clonodine. I suspected this was the cause of her head ache, and was concerned that this put her at high risk for a bleed. Her heart rhythm was a sinus rhythm with ventricular bigemeny, which she had no history of. It was probably caused here by the sudden dramatic increase in her blood pressure. Its worth noting that if you compare her palpable pulse to her EKG, you'll see that the PVCs were non-perfusing, with a pulse being generated only on the sinus beats. This would be an important in deciding if anti arrhythmics would be appropriate.

I transported her quickly, but code 1, to a stroke capable facility. En route i started a med line and put her on low flow 02 by nasal cannula. I kept an eye out for changes in her heart rhythm, and monitored her closely for changes in her neurological status.

Interestingly, while en route to the hospital she converted to a normal sinus rhythm for about five minutes. when she did, her palpable pulse at the radial was around 80, and she stated ""you know, I'm feeling a lot better. When she converted back to the bigemeny, her pulse fell back to 50 and she said ""Woh, something changed. i dont feel good""

I had fun doing this, so thanks everyone for the great discussion! I would be happy to do another one of these in the future, and I think it would be awesome if some other people wanted to do them too. This is a good place for us to share our knowledge, and discussions like this are a great way for that to happen.",,False,,t5_2rmg0,True,,,True,t3_qa3ry,http://www.reddit.com/r/ems/comments/qa3ry/als_scenario_ive_got_a_headache/,

So I am in Cabo on vacation for 5 days and today someone pulled a 7 year old boy out of the pool. He was AOx0, pulseless and had aspirated alot of water. When I got to the kid he had been down for 3 minutes already with people giving TV/Movie CPR on him. I stepped in after I made sure the hotel supervisor had called EMS. Worked the kid for 10 minutes while waiting for ems asking the supervisor over and over if they had an AED, medical kit, and to make sure that ems was coming. This being Mexico they had none of the things, and no one who worked at the hotel was first aid or CPR trained except me. Ems finally shows up to the pool and it is one guy in a jumpsuit with a cross on it, no gurney, no backboard, no aed, no bvm so I pick the kid up and quickly follow the ems guy to the ambulance. The gurney w/backboard is sitting there right next to the ambulance along with this guy's partner. He took over compressions and I left it there after attempting a report in Spanish. Im not sure if the child made it but it did not look good.

Tomorrow I am going to meet with the Manager of the resort and explain to him that this hotel needs some sort of emergency medical intervention if something like this happens again (and it will with all of the unsupervised children). Any tips when I talk to him? Suggestions?
My first time doing CPR and it is on a 7 year old kid and I think I feel totally fine I think. Thanks for reading this if you did.

&gt;This language is derogatory and not acceptable to the men and women who provide lifesaving emergency care to 70% of California. Make your voice heard and tell the California Legislature that this insulting legislation is unacceptable, not only to you, but also to their constituents.

&gt;Please call the following members of the Assembly Judiciary Committee and tell them to vote NO on SB 556, ANTI-Private EMS legislation that will force private EMT’s and Paramedics to be subjected to unnecessary and stigmatizing labeling requirements.
