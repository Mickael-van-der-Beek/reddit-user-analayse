1341803520.0,60,self.askdrugs,w92r2,Month Long Acid Trip - Tips/Advice?,drugthrowaway1000,73,13,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/w92r2/month_long_acid_trip_tipsadvice/,"Here's the skinny on my situation:

I got ahold of some acid last year. Did 7 trips over the course of two weeks and made some awesome art pieces (I paint and sculpt). I wound up making huge bank on the pieces and am now sitting on quite a large amount of money. 

Right after this, I figured I could do it again, but do it bigger. So after some hard work and lots of time, I acquired 1,500 hits of acid, then I hit a few art stores for everything I could need. My thought being I could spend 1 crazy month of making tons of artwork, then sell it off slowly and hardly have to deal with working again. I'm already set for 8-10 years, why not turn it into a lifetime.

So my goal is to make the perfect house setup for accommodating a wild tripping artist trying anything and everything to make masterpieces. At the same time, I want to document this the best I can, so I'm going to use my phone and tablet to make video and audio recordings as much as possible. I'm also going to try to document the state of my environment as well. 

I'm trying to cover as much as I can, but I can't think of everything, so that's why I'm here. If anyone here has tips, hints, advice, or anything you could possibly ask of me, I'm all ears. Anything about how I can best document my progress (apps for android, maybe?) safety tips in my house, decoration ideas to inhibit creativity, things you'd like me to remember about my experience, anything at all. You can also ask me any questions you have about my setup, mindset, or anything else.

Also, don't try to convince me otherwise on doing this. I'm fully aware of the possible permanent consequences, and I'm willing to take the risk.I'm a decently intelligent person, but this is something I've dreamed of doing and I'm finally able to do so - my heart tells me it's worth the try. Instead of trying to convince me otherwise, help me make it the best I can.

EDIT: Clarifying point, I have not only tripped acid 7 times. I've done it over the course of many years, but stopped about 5 years back when I moved and no longer had access. My binge last year was my first one in several years, but not my first one ever.",,False,,t5_2s8ie,1341854868.0,,,True,t3_w92r2,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/w92r2/month_long_acid_trip_tipsadvice/,

1344790193.0,32,self.askdrugs,y3jvk,Having a conversation with drug police about my LSD usage. Preparation help needed!,drugaway123,38,6,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/y3jvk/having_a_conversation_with_drug_police_about_my/,"So my parents found my LSD blotters and want me to talk informally with someone they know who work in the drug LE. I'd rather not tell where this is, but LSD is obviously not very legal. I can handle my parents just fine and they didn't take it too bad either. Actually it's kind of a relief to be able to be more open to them about it (btw, I'm above legal age and their attitude is more like ""we love and care about you, but it is also your life to live [except with some boundaries as long as you live in our house…]. We just don't want you to do anything stupid."") There's more details to it - but the reason I come to you is to ask for help with the police conversation.

Note that the conversation is completely informal and I do not risk any formal prosecution. I consider myself educated about LSD and do strongly believe that I have not acted irresponsible. The stuff I've taken has always been from a trusted source on SR in blotter form, and I do always test a sample before I take anything. I've also done my fair share of online reading and have watched relevant documentaries.

I've promised to stop taking any illegal substances for time being and will comply with every random tests my parents wants me to take. I'm completely fine with this; life is about more than psychedelics, and I have no trouble understanding where my parents come from. There's no need to upset them more (I love them very much) - but at the same time - if I am to be completely honest, I do not regret anything I've done and won't pretend otherwise. Therefore it is important to me to show that I'm a responsible and educated human being when talking with professionals (aka the police). My parents don't know shit about LSD, so this conversation is very important to me.

Do you have any tips on how to approach this? I have about one month ""preparation time"" and will definitely re-read a lot of the things I've read. Especially tips to good sources is appreciated. This does not include erowid, I'm thinking research papers, public statements from doctors and similar. I will be talking to someone who works with this every day and I need credible sources.

I'm also curious as to what studies he will refer to (I will ask for proof for any statements I'm not familiar with, but this will just make me look stupid if he's right all the time:/). My father has already spoken with the police and was told that LSD was damaging to the nervous system. This is news to me; is this true? A complete list of the verified dangers of LSD would be great, so I would know what's true, what's uncertain and what's not. Maps.org is probably a good place to start, although that's also the only good scientific source I know of.

Other things I should think of? It will undoubtedly be interesting to talk with someone official from ""the other side"" and I need all the help I can get. I will post an update when the conversation is done (I promise - OP will deliver!)

Tl;dr: Going to have an informal conversation with drug police about my LSD usage. What do I need to know and what arguments should I use to justify myself? Public statements from authority figures and good studies wanted!

EDIT: Another momentum that might help, would be ""role models"" - famous people - that have admitted to taking LSD. Steve Jobs is one person that comes to mind. Others?

EDIT 2: I should clarify. This LE is a family friend who happens to work in LE. He does not have any evidence against me, except what I will tell him in a personal setting face to face. I'm not afraid of legal trouble, but I appreciate the consideration. (The conversation is anyways not optional. My parents will turn me in to the real police if I do not comply and they actually have evidence.)",,False,,t5_2s8ie,1344835741.0,,,True,t3_y3jvk,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/y3jvk/having_a_conversation_with_drug_police_about_my/,

What is your drug faux pas or pet peeve?,istigkeit,33,5,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/wh7ot/there_is_an_overwhelming_amount_of_unspoken_rules/,"Sometimes I feel that when you decide to use your first drug, someone should give you an Official Drug Do's and Don'ts manual to keep you from pissing anyone off or triggering paranoia, etc.

A few examples to get the ball rolling:

   .:[ **FAUX PAS** ]:.

* You brought cannabis, but only enough for the buddy or two you know. You load a pipe and smoke with your pals, ignoring everyone else. 

ALTERNATIVE: Make it known you brought some bud, just not enough for everyone. Either offer to match bowls with someone there (someone will nearly always oblige), or excuse yourselves to a more private location.

* You take the last beer without saying anything, even if beer has been freely available. In some houses you may be outright bludgeoned/shot for this.

ALTERNATIVE: See the last beer, leave the last beer. It's for the host, **no matter what**. Goes along with leaving the beer you brought for the occasion when you leave, regardless of how much is left or how much you spent on it.

* You touch someone's paraphernalia without asking. This includes the bong sitting on the table in front of you with no other pieces in sight and you just offered to load a bowl.

ALTERNATIVE: Ask. People seem to become very attached to pieces, and grabbing one off a desk to peek at is akin to looking through dresser drawers.

 * You send a text to your dealer saying, ""Need a g or two for the rave tomorrow... this x gonna be as good as last time?""

ALTERNATIVE: Begin hoping common sense goes on sale somewhere.

 .:[ **PET PEEVES** ]:.

 * Referring to being high on mushrooms as ""frying."" It feels so far removed from what the feeling is actually like. When I hear someone say it I feel like they have no idea what they're talking about.

 * Asking about the ""freshness"" of bongwater.

1344940303.0,29,self.askdrugs,y7337,I've never been more scared in my entire life (meth overdose),temporaryaddict,33,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/y7337/ive_never_been_more_scared_in_my_entire_life_meth/,"I'm an experienced drug user and have been an addict for a few years, mostly with heroin.  Meth was always a drug I wanted to try but could never find it until today.  So I try it periodically throughout the day, alternating between smoking bowls and taking small shots.  I thought it would be a lot more intense than it was, it seemed really clear headed and mellow, with a lot of level-headed, non-jittery euphoria.  Later on, I noticed that my tolerance was getting higher and I wasn't getting any rushes at all from the shots anymore, so I decided to do a shot that was triple the size.  I thought it would just be a strong shot, but a safe one since I was used to judging doses with heroin.  Once of the worst I've ever made, I got a little too confident.  As soon as I finish injecting the shot, I lay the needle down and go to type something while I notice that my hands are starting to tingle really bad, really fast.  I look to the side and all of a sudden I had a rush that was way too intense, I felt extremely light-headed like I was about to pass out.  And then I start seeing light colors swirl across my monitors and the people in the video chat I was in looked like they were only moving 3 frames per second, like my mind was just dropping a lot of their movement, and they gained distinct black outlines.  Everything just started looking very unreal, almost as if I was in a nightmare.  I could have sworn to god that those were the last few minutes of my life and there was nothing I could do about it, since I was alone and knew nothing about meth overdoses.  So I panicked and tried to ask a friend of mine in the video chat for help, desperately but then my hands started seizing up completely, like my fingers on both hands both bent towards my palm and were extremely stiff, I couldn't move them at all.  Then I started freaking out, wondering if that particular shot was dirty and I just gave myself permanent paralysis in addition to a potentially lethal shot.  So I quickly private message my friend and tell that I need help right now, here's my number, then my hands started going out and I couldn't type anymore, but it was just in time.  He called and I swiped the phone to answer real quick and I could barely even say a word I was so high.  And I've been taking deep, rapid breaths through my mouth for about 2 hours now, I guess that's the downside of meth lasting for so long.  Anyways, he talked me through it telling me to relax and I probably didn't do enough to overdose and just having that friendly voice on the phone so I wasn't totally alone in my room made such a huge difference.  Almost like I had a helping, loving hand there to take care of me.  So that calmed me down, possibly relieved a panic attack that I could have been having too and got me to the point where I could manage it from then on it and I knew I wasn't going to die, but I stayed on the phone with him until I felt relatively safe again.  I always thought that I wasn't afraid of death at all, especially since I've overdosed on heroin a number of times and was revived, only to laugh when I hear about what happened.  I never took overdoses that seriously until this one, because with meth overdoses you're fully conscious and aware of what's going on, so you know that you could be on the verge of death and you have almost no time to do something about it.  I came back from that and I'd still feeling really anxious and rattled, but I have a newfound appreciation for life now.  I was really taking life for granted and was way too overconfident with hard drugs, acting like just because I've done a lot of hard drugs in the past, I could be a little reckless with this new drug.  I really learned the lesson the hard way.  I just had to tell a few people about it because I'm really shaken up about it, and it's good to hear about the bad and scary sides of drug use too so you know what the real risks are.  It's one thing to hear the facts, like what the symptoms of an overdose are, but to actually go through it yourself or even hear a firsthand account, I think would work a lot better.  I've learned my lesson, I just hope at least one other addict or prominent drug user remembers some piece of this write up next time they want to get really high and thinks twice about how much to do.  Every overdose is a tragedy.  You can always do more, but you can't undo what you've already done.  No matter which drug it is, your life isn't worth that risk and I know that when we've been using drugs for a long time we almost assume that we're invincible and don't even have to think about overdoses.  Well, I've noticed that overdoses happen when you least expect them which is scary when you think about it.  Sorry if that ended up being a rambling rant, I'm really shaken up and I'm trying not to forget any details.  Having my best friend come over shortly so we can talk about it, I've literally never been more scared in my entire life, thought it was all going to be over right as I was getting my life together again.  Dead, lying on the floor of my bedroom floor.  Mom probably would have opened the door and seeing me lying on the floor not moving.  That's painful to think about, she would absolutely crushed just because I made one little miscalculation.  Anyways, to flesh out this topic, I'd appreciate it if you had any stories about overdosing or being around someone that is overdosing and what should be done in such a situation, because if it ever happens again to me or someone around me, then I want to be fully prepared and know exactly what needs to be done.

I believe that a well-designed informational tool (such as a wallet-friendly card) with safety and dosage information, written accessibly and made fun, could potentially save lives and start conversations.

I really would like an unbiased opinion on what is normal and what is not.,WayTooEmbarrassed,25,1,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/oqh0m/boyfriends_drug_habits_are_making_me_nervous_i/,"My boyfriend and I are into psychedelics and he is into MDMA and similar drugs.  I don't consider myself anti-drug, and I try to be open minded.

Recently, my boyfriend has started hanging out more with his dealer, who's really untrustworthy (in my opinion).  This guy has lied about what he has given us, and lied about the effects/strength of the drugs we have gotten.  Later on, he has admitted to lying about these things, so it's not just him speaking to us out of ignorance.  The only reason my bf still talked with him and continued to do business with him was that: 1) He's really the only guy in town we have found who regularly has psychedelics, and 2) He gives away free drugs occasionally since he says my boyfriend is a ""friend"".  This dealer is the type of guy who would be hard strapped to have a conversation which ISN'T about drugs or drug experiences, and who takes drugs (like MDMA) while doing every-day activities like going to class, and also mixes a bunch of different drugs experimentally.  He gets new drugs and offers them to my bf to take them to ""see what they do"" or ""how they perform"".  I liked the older dealer a lot better because she was honest and nice, and didn't try to use others as ginea pigs, but she moved away.

Now, my boyfriend is usually pretty responsible, considerate, never misses a day of work, always goes to bed at 11pm sharp, etc.  A friendship is developing between them, starting with the time when the dealer came over for a smoke and they ended up doing DMT together at the dealer's request (and my boyfriend did it because he likes DMT and hadn't done it in a long time, and it would be free if they did it together).  At that time, he stayed up way past his self-imposed 'bedtime' even though earlier in the day he was very worried about going to bed on time.  Now they seem to be getting pretty buddy buddy and I'm getting worried because I personally think this guy is a bad influence, and my bf used to agree with me, but the more they get together and do drugs together the more this guy seems 'okay' to him.  

Yesterday they went out to a rave together, and my bf was going to take some MDMA.  Fine by me.  Today I wake up and find out he never came home... in fact, later I find out that he never went to the rave at all.  He stayed over at his dealer's house and took MDMA, MDAI, and MDA.  They got so high they couldn't drive to the rave.  The dealer did all that plus some other mixing including LSD.  The dealer offered/pushed a lot of these things to my bf but my bf turned the rest down aside from MDMA, MDAI, and MDA.  Hearing this made me extremely anxious because it's been my opinion that mixing drugs can be dangerous and since this guy is untrustworthy who knows if these things were even pure (it's happened before).  When I mentioned my worries to him, he seemed unworried himself and just said that the guy is not as bad as I think he is, and that he doesn't lie when pressured firmly for the truth.  My bf told me he didn't agree in mixing either but the dealer told him these were okay together and he believed him. I asked him if this would become a regular activity for him, and he said he would probably do it ""occasionally"".

Am I worried needlessly about this?  If i had it my way, we would keep this guy at a distance, but it seems like they are becoming friends despite my bf not liking him either initially

**tl;dr: My bf is hanging out more with his dealer, who is really shady and untrustworthy (in my opinion).  They have started mixing substances together which have been provided by this guy.

We see heavy drug use in crime dramas, mild use in things like stoner comedies, and constantly watch people drinking alcohol or smoking pot in regular sitcoms. 

That 70s Show aroused some issues about its amount of pot use but was ultimately extremely popular and accepted. It was also aimed at a younger demographic. Movies frequently depict drug use, the fun sides (often romanticized, *Harold and Kumar*) and the uglier sides (embellished or otherwise, *Fear &amp; Loathing*). And sure, they're rated for their content but anyone 17+ in America is still able to watch what's carried out on screen. 

Is the context what matters? Because we view it on a screen in a fictionalized story do we distinguish it from the type of drug use that has a negative stigma attached to it because of other media portrayals? How come society accepts the darker side as more self-evident than the funner perspective? Why do we readily accept this double-standard? Why is it so easy to separate one perspective from the other when the truth and reality is probably somewhere in the middle?

On the one hand, we have funny shows and movies depicting fun drug use, mostly with pot or alcohol. On the other, we are bombarded with news stories about the evils of drugs, the propaganda associated, and tragic stories about how *drugs* ruined a family but not *people*. People in real life will be demonized for their drug use and deemed criminals because of those types of media portrayals. But the happy-go-lucky stoners are excused because they're relatable and not portrayed as malevolent deadbeat criminals.


**TL;DR** We let media steer our perceptions of drugs which is why some of them have strictly negative associations which ultimately prohibits us from altering our perspectives.

I always take great care when using acid (LSD), even more when others are involved. However, I am quite certain that there will be a day someone makes a mistake or it just doesn't turn out the way it was supposed to.

I was wondering what the most efficient way is to relax someone who's having a bad trip.

* Are there certain things to say that often makes someone feel better about the situation?
* Is it worth using haloperidol? If so, how much should I approximately use? Is there more effective medication?

They live in a wealthy suburb of Houston and the drugs these young teenagers can get ahold of is outstanding. I've done my fair share of illicit substances, and have been around plenty of people who've done theirs as well, but I've avoided acid because I am extremely sensitive to all drugs of all sorts and just don't want to know what LSD would do to me.

Obviously 15 seems a bit..young, to say the least. Assuming most of you are older, would you have ever contemplated doing that at 15? What effects do you imagine that having on someone so immature (particularly him) and inexperienced? Is it as bad as I'm making it sound? He trusts me implicitly as his older sister, so I guess I'm just trying to find a way to approach him and tell him how much of an idiot he is, without doing the whole ""Drugs are bad, mmk?"" spiel (mostly because I don't think all drugs are bad - moderation is key, as well as knowing the appropriate time and place - but he doesn't really need to taught that from someone he regards as a role model, not right now anyway).

I have some powdered Xanax so I took some last night.

I diluted the mixture and measured it out, so my exact doses won't be perfect. ~2mg 1 hour before bed, ~2mg 30 minutes before bed, and ~2mg before getting in bed.

I was definitely feeling the effects before I got in bed. Nothing intense though. Just the normal mild benzo high.

I fell asleep perfectly as expected and woke up 10 hours later feeling great. Made breakfast, reddited for about 20 minutes, and then I started feeling tired again. Laid down on my couch which wasn't doing it for me, and got back in bed. Fell asleep instantly and woke up not knowing what time it was.

This is when things got REALLY weird. I started having some severe hallucinations. I can't remember them all, but I can remember a few:

Waking up MULTIPLE times but realizing that I was still in a dream.

Towels hanging from over my bed hitting me in the face and when I looked up, nothing was there.

My cat walking on my bed and sniffing my face, and when I looked up nothing was there.

Eating some kind of candy from the night stand next to my bed, and when I looked over nothing was there.

I can't remember all of them, but if I could I could write tons more of these.

It was by far the weirdest experience of my whole life. I want to believe that it's related to the large dose of Xanax, but it just seems odd that I woke up normally and made breakfast and then after that shit went down.

I've woken up during REM sleep before and had some weird hallucinations but they normally pass in less than 20 seconds. This went on for what I'd guess to be 15 minutes.

Keep no written records of any kind if possible is a must

never carry more than you need for a specific delivery

if you have to drive to or from a deal only bring what you need and don't do any other errands or driving until you are clean

store cash in an envelope marked ""new car fund"" or something like that

always store cash and drugs separately for obvious reasons

this is a little hard but try not to have stuff bagged up until you are ready to sell it

keep your scales clean

store drugs/scales/baggies/cash all stored separately 

try to keep traffic down to a minimum, in all the busts I have read about/seen on tv the number one thing that ended up getting people in trouble was traffic to and from their spot. Usually neighbors get annoyed and call it in, in some cases the neighbors will do surveillance for LEO recording car plates and frequency of traffic

These recent stories in the media of people dying from psychedelic RCs has got me concerned for myself and my friends who have begun to trip over the last few months. (I've joined in twice, others in the group have tripped more. Both experiences were very positive and enjoyable for everyone involved.)

So far, the drugs I've found that can be laid on blotter and sold off as LSD are: DOB, DOC, Bromo Dragon-fly, LSA, 25-i, and 25-c.

I realize that what is sold to us as LSD may be one of these chemicals (or probably is) but I tend to go in with the mindset of ""okay, I'm going to trip for potentially 24+ hours and I accept that"".

My brief research on each of these chemicals has never revealed any fatal side effects but, to be honest, these recent stories of tragic deaths have unnerved me.

I understand that not much is known about all of the effects of RCs but I was wondering if there were any drugs that I have listed here that can be fatal at a certain dose that can be fit upon blotter paper and if there are any other drugs that can be passed off as LSD that I was not aware of.

I want to give advice about how to regulate drug use, like keeping it to occasions like festivals and when good clubnights and DJs are on here (I live in a small city, it doesn't happen often) 

The drugs I'm going to cover in the 'zine are Acid, Cocaine, Ecstasy pills, MDMA (and things sold as MDMA, like PMA) Speed, Sprayed weed, Ketamine. 

These are the drugs that most of my friends take on a regular basis and are all drugs I have experience with. They're the drugs that most of the people who live in my city who take drugs take on a regular basis.

However, I’m really starting to think that either the site or the labs that “test” stuff that gets sent it is a scam. I say this because we sent in a cap of powder “molly” only to get very confounding results from ecstasydata.


So we got some powder molly which from my experience with powder street molly, I figured it was most likely heavily cut or bunk stuff. We reagent tested it and it tested for MDA but the weird part was that it took forever for the color to change. We decided to do an acetone wash on it and afterwards we ended up with half the amount we started with. We reagent tested the washed stuff and the results were weird again. The color changes indicated MDA but the reaction was very slow again... We figured that it was some MDXX that was very similar in chemical structure to MDA and just decided to take it. I must mention that one person out of our group did not choose to have his stuff washed so he took unwashed stuff.


We first took about 60mg and it felt very speedy at first and then slowly went away and then it felt like we were on something but no roll whatsoever. So we kept taking more and we ended up taking close to 200mg... but still no roll. However what we did feel after taking that amount was a very uncomfortable body high which basically felt like nothing was happening mentally but our body was experiencing an intense body high which was not pleasant at all. I felt like I was home but had sent my body off to a rave and it was raging by itself. And the girls who are smaller, felt like our legs were sedated/paralyzed and almost could not walk. It took forever to walk small distances and we had to force every movement out of our body. The body high also came in annoying waves. This immobilziation lasted pretty much the entire day from morning til late night. The most wacked up shit however, was the fact that our pupils were dilated, but they kept pulsing back and forth, almost like our body was dealing with a stimulant and a non-stimulant and couldn’t fucking decide whether to keep the pupils dilated or not. This effect lasted until the next day.


The person who took unwashed stuff was throwing up many times, I’m not sure whether this is because of the stuff that did not get washed away or because he was smoking a lot. The rest of us who took washed stuff did not throw up or feel any nausea. Some friends have previously taken the stuff and we only found out that day that they threw up after taking it as well (unwashed). Here is the most idiotic part of the story. We were soo fucking excited that our wash had worked and was looking forward to a good time that none of us realized that after we had washed our stuff, what we got out of it were NOT crystals. It was powdery almost like the texture of flour, and we noticed that when we licked it it turned a light tan color... which definitely does not happen with mdma and I’m assuming mda as well.


So having experienced such fucked up shit, we were sooo curious as to what on earth we took and decided to send it off to ecstasydata.org. However, the results we got were so surprising. It said that it was pure MDA... Which our experience does not relate to... if we had taken close to 200mg of MDA we would have been floored... And granted that we lose some product after doing an acetone wash we lost like half the original stuff which means that the starting substance was not pure. And I’m assuming what got washed up made those who threw up throw up. The only thing I could think of was that perhaps we had gotten only one isomer of MDA? But what are the fucking chances of that you know? Apparently one isomer is responsible for the bodily high and the other is responsible for the mental high... But I seriously doubt it. The pulsing pupils, the stuff going tan after licking it, NOT being crystals after the acetone wash, people puking, and the fact that the reagent test took so long to change colors indicates that it was NOT MDA. (Also, I recently tested legit mdma and my reagent test worked perfectly well so it’s not a problem with the reagent tests).


So my belief now is that ecstasydata.org never put our stuff through GC/MS and all they did was reagent test it and the color having indicated MDA, posted it as MDA. Since the whole point of the site is to GC/MS the stuff being sent it, and reagent tests are not 100% indicative of what exactly you have and the purity, my conclusion is that ecstastydata or the labs, probably both in my opinion, are a scam. Just wanted to share our experience with them.

What do you think, redditors?


P.S. I also remember this one time seeing on the site how they had updated an entry after whoever sent in their powder molly contacted them saying that they had deliberately added another substance to their batch but it didnt show up in their results... and they explained this by saying that it was probably bc they hadn’t mixed up the batch well -_- and that once they did they did detected trace amounts of the substance. Does this sound kind of sketchy to you guys?


Sorry this was long, but felt like I had to explain the whole story. Also, if anyone has any idea wtf we took please share your opinions!

However, everyone involved ended up blacking out and waking up in the hospital. Two had seizures. What the hell happened? I have three hypotheses, and none are that great.

* The dose of 2cb was MUCH higher than it should have been...i would guess somewhere above 60mg to cause memory loss like that
* It wasnt actually 2cb but a structurally similar compound like 2c-p, 2cb-fly or even that bogeyman bromo-dragonfly. Im not sure of the accuracy/specificity of testing kits for phens.
* The pill contained an adulterant as well as MDMA. I've looked it up on pillreports and no dice (various colors, olympic rings, scotland). Im not sure how good these cats are at reading testing kits and im furthermore not sure of exactly what kind of kit was used.

I'll start.

LSD visuals: Gently rotating fractal imagery. Floral patterns seeming to ""bloom"" out of surfaces. Twisting, sometimes labyrinthine patterns appearing to ""crawl"" over surfaces. Objects appearing to ripple or pulsate with varying new colors (esp. green and pink, in my experience). Trails/afterimages of quickly/broadly moving objects. Light sources appear to be surrounded by rainbow coronas. Colors appearing to ""shift"" - the color remains the same, but for some reason, the color now seems different than it was before.

LSD body: Varies with the dosage. On one hit, the sensation of a indeterminate ""energy"" flowing along the spine, and down the arms and legs. On multiple hits, more of an analgesic effect - sensation everywhere except hands and feet is reduced. Slight ataxia and overall clumsiness.

LSD mindset/thinking: A feeling as though everything is new and interesting. See everyday things that are taken for granted in a new light. Propensity for ""stream of consciousness"" speaking - sentences begin in one place and end in a completely different place as the speaker voices new thoughts, and quickly forgets old ones. Greatly increased ability to find meaningful symbols. Thought pattern becomes less linear - thinking many different thoughts at once, with none of them being the main focus of attention, yet each thought is being developed separately. Increased sensitivity to the emotions of others. Ability to ""communicate"" with other trippers without speaking - often feel as though someone else is voicing/drawing/doing/etc exactly what you were thinking.

I wanted to test out and experiment with it's recreation use a bit, so I tried it by itself (1 and 2mg), with weed(1mg) and with light drinking (1mg as well). Each experience was pleasant enough, i guess, but really couldn't understand why people would pay money for this kind of high.

I have relativly high muscle tension and mild general anxiety, so i figured 2 mgs would put me in a very relaxed, super-chill mode, but in the end I felt little to no physical relaxation. My muscles were still very tense and mostly unchanged. My mind did feel rather relaxed but, also just very slow, sluggish and unengaged. No euphoria or anything, I just felt drugged and incapable.

With alcohol the experience was a bit nicer, more of happy smile-to-myself, i-don't-give-a-fuck, type of high, but still nothing to write home about.

With weed it was similar as with alcohol, more intense body-high and pretty chilled out. But again, just not really anything i would find to have an obvious recreational purpose. Generally uneventful and non-engaging.

Sometimes, people think a drug is bad if and only if it is physically addictive.

It seems to me that psychological addiction is a far more important issue. If physical addiction was the only problem, people could simply intelligently taper their use and stop without serious withdrawal. Psychological addiction is what prevents that, and for example results in recklessly seeking highs even when running out and serious withdrawal is an inevitable consequence. Psychological addiction also seems to be responsible when people stop a drug, get over all the withdrawal, and then later start using it again.

I realize that psychological addiction is a vague term. I'm talking about general psychological patterns which lead to compulsive behaviour.

Probably about 3 - 4 weeks ago, I tried acid for the first time that I got from a guy I met in a club. He seemed like a decent enough guy and gave me his number and everything so I could hit him up for some more if I liked it. 

Overall it was a really good trip, I really enjoyed it and I experienced most of the things people describe they experience. However, I've heard people describe it before that you see things like colour running from the walls, or things around me warping and getting a bit weird, but I don't think I experienced any of that stuff at all. Everything seemed to look relatively normal, there really wasn't any change in the way anything looked. Things sounded awesome however, I sat there listening to The Beatles and drifted off feeling amazing. That night I did have a few drinks, not too much as to inebriate myself, if that would make an impact at all. 

Now, my mates of mine have been really keen on trying acid for a while, and we really want to have a good first time trip with the lot, this Saturday.

Was it just the way I reacted to it? Should I look for a different guy? Should I try taking a bit more than just that one tab? Or does not everybody see crazy stuff the first time?

Today is 31st of October and is actually the only day for months that I have a free house for a few nights. Me and 2 friends are about to embark on an Acid trip with LSD and wondering if you guys have any tips to help us get started?

I have already read the Drugs AMA for LSD and done research on its effects and that. We are a bit nervous but nothing serious, just like when you queue for a roller coaster your know your fine and will enjoy it but you just get a bit jittery. We all smoke cannabis and plan to vape a small bit each just to help relax us, I have also been told that we all should get everything important out the way like Showering, Toilet dumps, preparing food.

Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

p.s. I know its Halloween, I have loads of calm music and films to watch on PS3. I'm not even going to dare to watch any TV tonight because I don't want something as stupid as Sabrina the Teenage witch making me crap my pants. Also being where we are, trick or treating really isn't a problem. If someone does come to the door I'll push the packs of candy through the letterbox and tell them I'm an evil professor who cannot see the light of darkness.

I need some advice fellow redditors",jedemon,17,4,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/11zebw/my_friends_trip_went_very_badly_and_we_drifted_i/,"So before I begin to explain the symptoms he experienced, hes gone through some rough events recently in his life. For all intentions and purposes, well call my Friend *Jim*.

We're in college, not going to specify age, but when we were in high school, jims best friend (a girl, also who he was 'in love' with) commited suicide. Heartbreaking. He was nothing short of an outstanding friend to her. She had a shitty boyfriend at the time also, and even become close with her family after her passing. He went through the stages with coping with death. But out of the passing, he met another girl. Things were going good for a while, but one of our mutual friends ended up in a relationship with her. 

this left Jim in a state of utter depression. He hates our mutual friend now and even the girl for whom he had developed feelings.

Now to the trip. He came to visit me in college with two other friends. 2 of the 3 friends took acid with me. Jim and I took 2 tabs each (could be anywhere from 2-3, since i cut em up myself). 

First 3-4 hours of the trip were amazing. We were all having a great time and everything was ""normal"" in our trip so to speak. This is when things got weird.

We all realized that Jim had disappeared in my apartment for about 15 minutes. He then came out of no where, grabbed my remote control to the television and slammed it on the ground as hard as he could. shattering the remote to tiny little pieces. This scared everyone in the room (my two roommates who werent tripping but love to trip themselves and my 2 friends from home).

When we approached him and tried to talk to him he would only respond with ""FUCK YOU."" He had signs of paranoia Ive never seen first hand before. He would ask who is upstairs (even though we were the only ones in the apartment, and he knew this as well. Our apartment was 3 bedrooms. not a big place. He tried to tell me that the tabs we took were fake and that he wasnt tripping. He thought we were setting him up for something. what that something was, ill never know. Maybe he thought we were going to injure him. But he looked frustrated/scared/not himself. Ive never seen him like this, meanwhile im trippin on 2+ tabs myself. Its hard to differentiate reality from tripping in the first place. although the events that occured had severely sober up. I thought he was going to try and drive home (4 hour drive away). I was ready to tackle him if he made a move to run outside. We wound up in my room and sat there without saying a word for 8 hours. 

scared for my life was an understatement. 

This was over a year ago, and to this day we havent talked, nor have I seen him. He is still in contact with some of my other friends which is good, because i genuinely cared for this kid. still do. He was a great guy, with such unfortunate events in his life.

I heard through other friends that he thought that, and i quote, ""we were going to have an orgy""

Not only I am dumbfounded and baffled by what was going through his head, but why wouldnt he want to talk to me from this trip? I tried to convince myself he was just embarrassed. But ill never know. 

I sent him a couple texts but never got any responses.  I guess maybe for the better we split ways.

I'm more concerned with potency than with flavor or historical accuracy, but would ideally make a product that doesn't taste horrible. Lots of research yielded lots of different methods, so I tried to synthesize the best bits of each to create the recipe that I plan to follow. Below is the recipe for my prototype batch. Please weigh in with any thoughts, wisdom, or words of warning.

1) I got 65 grams (2.3 ounces) of dried 'Hens &amp; Chicks' type pods from an organic farm that I trust.

2) Grind them to a fine powder in a coffee grinder.

3) Moisten the powder with just enough warm water to slightly dampen it throughout, massage it in a plastic bag to make sure the mash is evenly moistened.

4) Freeze this mash in order to rupture the cell walls allowing for maximum extraction.

5) Defrost the mash, spread it out on a cooking tray, and let it dry.

6) Vigorously stir the powder into a dark-colored jar with 190 proof grain alcohol. I plan to pour in enough so that all the poppy powder is floating in and exposed to the alcohol. I have 750ml of it, and it's hard to get where I live so I'd like to stick with the full bottle or less. (Any suggestions for determining ideal amount? I want a concentrated, potent final product. Also, here's where I may add spices - anise, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, safran. Any suggestions on a good spice combo and measurements to use?)

7) Keep it in the dark, cool basement for 2 months, shaking it every few days.

8) Use a cheese cloth or old cotton t-shirt as a filter (or should I use something else?) to remove all solids, with the remaining liquid hopefully being somewhat decent Laudanum.

9) Take small doses until I get a feel for the potency.
I have heard that some people use activated charcoal, wax, oil, or fat to increase extraction (or does it increase oral bioavailability?) Should I be using one of these?

It groups them together and calls them bad and claims health issues, mental issues and becoming an outcast. These claims are often flawed or false, even if they are effective to some extent. And it seems when kids get old enough to be curious and try different drugs they find out that what they were taught was wrong or at least lacking in full disclosure, which leads me to believe they would become more curious to see what else they've been misinformed on. Just from my experiences, I feel this is kind of how the sequence of things happens. Those who are likely to do it are going to and probably become more likely to try new things. Why not give full disclosure of drugs, their effects and their history and side effects?

yesterday I ingested shrooms for the first time, a very small amount, maybe 4-5 liberty caps, and was left utterly disappointed.

I had prepared myself mentally and spiritually for years and years, as I wasn't ""ready"" at that time, and I finally took some in a traffic-filled, port-city, with someone who I dearly love, but is not on the same plane as me. I felt tingly, giggly, but very, very dumb. There was no connection to anything, no greater awareness, no deep thinking. After smoking, there were intense visuals, but nothing more. I felt judgy and self-conscious.

I prepared this list of intentions too, hoping that I would sort some things out, maybe learn to not judge myself and others as harshly, be open to new experiences, find my self-worth, etc. Unfortunately, I felt extremely judgy...as if everyone around me thought I was a junky, acting inappropriately. I did not have a 'bad' trip, it was pleasant. I am left feeling more confused, however, and straight-up alienated. I know that I can't run to substances to solve my inner crisis...is that maybe my 'revelation' from this whole experience?

On top of that, my significant other was pretty un-interested and less than supportive, which makes me feel, well, disoriented. He joked that I didn't learn to relax and take life un-seriously, as I got upset with him for wrongly stating that my experience was due to my brain cells dying.

The fact that there is a shortcut to in-game utility (as in, a shortcut to money, weapons, cool stuff, etc.) makes trying to acquire it through conventional means feel pointless, and the payoff feel less exciting.

I've heard similar logic being applied to numerous recreational drugs. I have these anecdotes in my head, (they may be from forums, friends, or school anti-drug propoganda, I don't remember) of drugs making normal life feel pointless. Like, stories of people having sex on ecstasy and never being to enjoy sex again. Or of people taking meth or heroin, and losing interest in life, since nothing lives up to the extreme highs they had. 

I guess what I'm asking is, since drugs give you a shortcut to pleasure and spiritual experiences, does it dampen the drive and payoff of real-life pursuit of happiness?

And if so, what is the scope of this ""cheat code"" effect? Can even *lower level* drugs, like say marijuana, produce an effect like this?

But I think I'm just done with taking them, as in, I no longer want to be on them. I haven't been on them for long, only about 5 months?... And despite all the ""It gets better. Just give it time."", I just don't want to wait it out. It's getting annoying. Being put on a new med = more side-effects like nausea, sweating like hell, no appetite, sleepiness, ED, etc.

I'm currently on Wellbutrin... I've taken it for about 3 months, 150mg, 300mg, and now 450mg. I could say that there were a day or two where it made me feel energetic at work, but I don't know if it's placebo or not. I did pull an all-nighter, and I read something about not sleeping and how it might actually make you more energetic than tired.

Dunno if it's that. But I've also been on Prozac for 2 and a half months, 10mg, then 20mg, another 20mg. It didn't really help. Ritalin on my first month of seeing the psychiatrist because he thought I had ADD or anxiety and was just going through trial and error, throwing darts and seeing which one works or not. Now that I think about it, these psychiatrists really don't seem to care. Just give you meds and bam. No warnings about starting to take meds and how it might affect you.

I told him that I was sweating a lot from taking Wellbutrin, so he decided to prescribe me Inderal, a beta blocker which I had no clue about. So, prescribing me a med to deal with a med's side-effect, which might cause even MORE side-effects and needing more meds to deal with those side-effects, etc.

What's the big deal? I don't want to discourage anyone from taking meds (nor am I telling you to take these meds), but why can't psychiatrists at least recommend some alternative methods? Yeah, I do exercise. I do hang around with friends, but hanging around with friends is starting to look pointless to me. Literally. I don't think my brain has the ability to enjoy any of it.

So I'm looking to see if stuff like L-Phenylalanine or L-Tyrosine might work. I don't know... I'm not really confident in them working but I read that there's a lot less side-effects from these supplements than there are from meds. And I also read that they don't take months or so to see results (whether it works or not).

So yeah, I think I'm gonna try to see if I can get off Wellbutrin. I honestly don't know how much Prozac or Wellbutrin helped me, maybe it did, maybe it didn't, but let's just say when I got off Prozac (cold turkey), I didn't really feel any differences... No withdrawals, but that's probably common with Prozac. I actually cold turkey'd Wellbutrin 150mg for about 2 weeks before going on 300mg (I just went back on 300mg rather than slowly titrating and didn't feel too bad).

I read that in order for Wellbutrin to work, your brain has to have enough dopamine in the first place.

2. I am also wary of upping the dose. After all this is a hormone that the body produces and I don't want to be dependent of outside sources to fall asleep.

For someone who is depressed, what would be a dose you would recommend to give anti-depressant effects (I would also enjoy its recreational effects too I guess)?

What have your personal experiences been? I just read that the effects might be for two weeks. Is that true? Can it be longer lasting?

I have always been pretty sketched out by Ketamine. A girl I know's roommate just dropped out of school (who knows where she is now) because she was addicted. Could this be something that I could truly use ""just once""? 

What negative effects could ketamine have on the brain/body?

Would ketamine interact badly with SSRIs or Wellbutrin?

Edit: When obtaining ketamine, is there common cases of receiving fakes, and if so, what is a good way to tell?

What is the likelihood of any negative psychological or personality changes after taking ketamine?

Edit 2: Could this drug have the potential to push someone who has never experienced mania into a manic or manic-like experience that lasts longer than the duration of the drug?

Edit 3: I'm not suicidal and am okay. In general, I can be a bit moody, but my meds have made that less of a problem than the other effects of depression. Well I guess I'm often lethargic and flat and experience emotions in a more dulled way. I'm planning on dropping out of school after this term and getting a job because I often have low motivation and focusing problems, and this is after recently increasing my Wellbutrin dosage (from 100mg to 150mg.)

I took two tabs and was tripping for 19 hours. definitely too strong of a dosage. I did have some good times at first during my trip such as the visuals, etc, but a huge part of my trip was me being anxious and feeling like something huge was about to happen. I started analyzing human interaction and life/society in general, and even months later, I know that I have to be productive/work hard in school to achieve success, but i have a kind of ""what's the point?"" attitude. I feel really jaded about life, yet I still try to be optimistic. I thought a huge part of me feeling this way was that last semester I was a huge stoner smoking multiple bong rips everyday. I decided to take a tolerance break on New Years, and even though I am not out of it anymore, my perspective is still the same. I think it largely has to do with my bad trip. So many people I know love lsd and appreciate it to its maximum. Why did this happen to me? I feel like I'm fucked for life. Even the way I look at things seems different. I feel like an observer living in the world with everything i do... hard for me to feel happy and grateful. This sucks and I really want to go back to the way I was.

Want to ask r/askdrugs some questions!,Debatewithpops,12,2,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/1gvvgg/debating_with_dad_want_to_ask_raskdrugs_some/,"I'm 17 years old. Me and my dad were discussing drugs and he has the mentality that every drug user is a low life loser who got into drugs by experimenting and getting addicted. I said not everyone who gets into drugs is addicted and that the addicts who want help should get help. He refuses to believe anything like that. So I have a couple questions. 

1. Why do people start doing drugs if they know its bad for you? I think moderation is a key in using drugs but I would like to hear your answers. 

2. What happens when you get caught with drugs? Not drugs with the intention to sell but for personal use. My dad was telling me that they get arrested and they get help. Is this true or do they just get thrown in jail/prison?

3. Should drugs get legalized and regulated? I feel that if that happens more money would go towards helping people quit drugs instead of giving them a criminal record for something that is not harming anyone else. 

4. Can drugs be taken moderately or will you become addicted quick? I think that drugs can be taken moderately if one knows their limit. 

5. Will addicts choose drugs over their own family? My dad says they will start to once addicted, but I don't think so. I think when addicts start stealing from their family or choosing to partake in their choice of drug instead of being with their family, that isn't the addict doing it. It's the addiction. That person doesn't want to do what he/she does but they do it to feed their addiction because their body needs it. Understand where I'm coming from?

6. Lastly, are there weed smokers who only smoke weed? My dad says he has yet to meet someone who has only smoked weed and hasn't done any other drug. My argument is that, what person who has it good for them would even admit to smoking marijuana? The way it is looked down upon by others, why would someone who has a well paying job, has a great family, and lives a happy life admit to smoking weed?
My dad most likely asks the people he knows by his job. Take note that they are all homeless and don't try to change their lifestyles. 
I think smoking weed after a long day of work is equivalent to a drink after a long day of work. I occasionally smoke pot and haven't done any other drug. 

So guys please let me here your thoughts. I want to read answers from people who partake in drug use whether you are an addict or a moderate user. I'm open minded so please feel free to disagree with me on anything, but inform me why you disagree.

I'm a professional writer; I make my living primarily by writing scripts for stage plays and training films, but I've begun a novel (masochism being a thing that's always fun) and I have bumped into a series of questions I think that this community could help me with. I thank you in advance for your attention and thoughts. 
Okay. Imagine it's... 1975-ish.  No internet. No way to post questions on global bulletin boards eliciting all sorts of smart answers :)  If you're a newcomer to any kind of exotic experience, you have few choices except to dive in and... experience it. 
 
Okay. Now imagine a guy in his late teens, college-age. He's a bit of a low-rent hustler, a scamster, charming and funny and not interested in anything resembling work.  He also has certain understandings about which he has not yet learned-- he's a guy who is going to find out that he can see into other dimensions. (You can tell where I'm headed I bet.)

Okay. NOW imagine this fellow deciding to experiment for the first time with psychedelics.  He has no idea the world of shit he's about to inadvertently put himself into. He thinks he's only going to have fun.

Okay. First of all:  I'm not sure whether to push him in the organic direction (mushrooms/peyote/et al) or the synthetic direction (LSD)  Is there any sense in this community of which was more readily available and/or popular back then? Is there any sense of which might generate visions that are more... how to say this... supernatural/menacing?

Second: How much money would this fellow need for one or two uses?

Third: (This one might take awhile:) If he has no guide, if he's on this safari all by himself with little or no sense of what to expect, what are the things he'll notice early in the trip?  How about a bit later? How about at peak? (I know the answers for this are different depending upon the drug-- if you're still reading this and willing to answer, please feel free to pick a single substance and stay with it.)

Fourth: At what level of specificity would he have to narrate monstrous visions before more experienced users said ""Um, dude, there's no way that was just the drug.""  For instance, if he spoke of having lengthy physical combat with a spiny shadow, and then showed long scratches on both arms, would an experienced user say ""You tripped hard and scratched yourself"" or would s/he more likely say ""that doesn't look like any acid _I_ ever heard of!""

Last: Imagine that he tried whatever it is once and had little or no effect and decided ""fuck it, I'm going hard next time"" and went overboard with his dosage.  Can you provide me some street-smart notion of what ""not enough"" would be and what ""too much"" would be? 

Once again, I thank you for your attention and for any guidance you might be willing to offer.

This summer, I want to decorate my room and change it entirely. It is about a little bit bigger than average bedroom, but not by much.

I want to make this bedroom a place where I can sleep normally on weekdays and be comfortable and be able to hang out with friends while having fun with weed, mush and lsd for 2-3 hours (of course we will got outside after, but you know, when you are tripping, it is nice to have a place inside to trip if it's raining or snowing too much.)

What I want to put in this bedroom:
-a bed! it will be either dropped directly on the floor or I will install something so I can drop it on the wall like this :

-a center table to put bongs,drinks,drugs or whatever you have in your hands.
-a couch with alot of pillows to cuddle/chill on it.¸
-a bookshelf with books and music cd's.
-some sick painting on the walls (probably gonna hire someone talented to do this and yes I expect to pay alot for it)

Now my questions:
-What should/could I put in my bedroom that is a good idea that I forgot?
-What should I not put in my bedroom because it is a bad idea?
-With paintings like this http://imgur.com/a/t1IOS , will I be able to sleep?

3. 150mg initial, 5 additional 30mg redoses over a course of two hours: the trip was not as strong as trip #1, but wholly pleasurable and fun. No downsides at all, it was the perfect trip.  

Additionally, I dropped 2 tabs of acid about 5 weeks ago; the first part of the trip (trippy visuals, very laugh-happy, increased body temperature) was very fun. The second part (open-eye visuals stopped, closed-eye visuals began, very dissociative, mind raced, reduced social ability) was uncomfortable at first, and sometimes too powerful to keep my eyes closed. However, the more I allowed myself to go with the effects, the less uneasy I felt. I experienced severe dissociation of mind from body, but not in any negative way, and would stop whenever I would open my eyes. My skin began to lose sensation, which did become very uncomfortable, but was greatly reduced after a shower. Eventually the more powerful effects of the trip subsided and I enjoyed the relaxing, albeit sluggish feeling. Overall, I would consider the trip to be overall positive, but perhaps too intense for my first time.

I'm sorry to list out these trips like this, but I felt that it would give some perspective and insight. Now on to the actual event:

I'm home on break from university, and sometimes I work with my dad during my vacations. Sunday night, I drove to my dad's and smoked a bowl outside in my car before going inside (around 10:30 pm). We had to be up early for work, but given that I had woken up at 4 pm on Sunday, I figured that I wouldn't be able to sleep naturally before then. At about 2 am, I took 50mg DPH (diphenhydramine, sleeping pill) and took a shower, hoping that by the time I was done I would be tired. Unfortunately, I wasn't, and so to kill time I watched L.A. Confidential (enjoyed it, would recommend). After that, I figured that if I wasn't going to get any sleep (we were expected to be at work at 5:30 am), that I could at least relax before work, and so I decided to smoke a bowl out on the balcony. It was fairly cold out, and so I only smoked about 2 half-filled bowls before I had to go back inside to warm up. However, during the smoking session, I began to feel very ""mentally affected"" (not sure how to describe it) whenever I would hold the hit, and I could already tell that I was very high. I put away my paraphernalia and tried lying down, but I found myself in a state where my eyes were too tired to stay open for very long, but upon closing my eyes, my mind would start to race and my entire body would feel as if it were in free fall. I would also have mild closed-eye visuals (not to the degree of my first DXM/acid trip). Needless to say, this was very uncomfortable for me, as I was perpetually opening and closing my eyes to combat the two different discomforts. Soon after, my entire body felt very cold, despite the fact that I was fully clothed with a hoodie and winter jacket on, undernearth a fairly warm comforter. My legs began to tremble, and I noticed that my heart was beating noticeably harder, and in my opinion, faster (in the moment I was unable to determine my heart rate, and to be fair, I believe my fear made me believe it was higher than it actually was). It was very similar to the negative effects of my first DXM trip. To counteract my discomfort, I had to continuously walk around my dad's apartment, stopping every now and then to try and relax, to no avail. It was at this point that I noticed that my eyes were incredibly red, including the eyelids. Normally, I never get red eyes from smoking. My pupils dilated normally, and I did look fairly normal in the mirror, save for my eyes. As I was still very cold, I had to stay in the warmer parts of the apartment to avoid further discomfort. I did notice that the thermostat was set to 60 degrees for some reason, so I imagine that my perceived coldness might not have been solely an effect from the high. During this entire time, my heart racing began to trouble me more and more. I had recently read that the risk of heart attack during the first hour was 4-5x higher than normal, so even though I consider myself a person with a low risk of heart attack, I was very fixated on the possibility that I could have a heart attack. I spent a long time searching the apartment for aspirin, knowing that it would prevent clotting. I found some and took 1 325mg tab, which I had read was enough to prevent all clotting in the body (just an FYI). I had lost track of time during this, and I could only remember that I had checked my phone at 4:30 am, an indeterminable amount of time after I had smoked, so I spent the next hour in this fear-stricken state. I tried to keep a cool exterior for the most part, because during the course of my freakout my dad had gotten up and we were getting ready to leave. I was in my dad's van at 5:30, and I think that mentally this had a relieving effect, as I started to feel better. However, this effect was only temporary, and I started to feel what I can only describe as ""general uneasyness"" throughout my body. Luckily I had brought a pillow with, and keeping my head in the pillow in my lap and breathing made me feel better. I have a suspicion that breathing in this fashion caused my carbon dioxide levels in my blood to rise, which may have been a pseudo-hyperventilation technique. I could say with all certainty that I was no longer high at all by 6 am, but this uneasy feeling persisted. I was fortunate that the work involved driving 3 hours each way, so I was able to maintain my head-in-lap position for a long time, minimizing my discomfort. I keep my eyes closed the entire trip, but I was completely unable to sleep. We stopped for gas after about 1.5 hours, and I ate a couple donuts and drank some powerade zero in an attempt to settle my insides (probably not the best I could have done, but pickings were slim at this gas station). When we arrived at the job site, it was 9:15 am and I felt reasonably better, enough that I was able to do my job effectively. The job is physical in nature, but nothing very demanding that day. By about 2 pm, I felt good enough to jump on and off the truck, which was reassuring. I felt fairly normal by the time we left at about 4 pm, and after eating I figured I was back to normal. However, later that night, I started to feel very drained emotionally, and my fears started to pick up a little. I became concerned about my heart again, but after using a blood pressure/pulse monitor, my readings were 104/62 and 70 bpm. I figure the elevated (relative to my resting rate of ~55 bpm) pulse was from anxiety. Additionally, my emotional state may have been influenced from stomach issues that I was having at the time. I finally was able to get to sleep at about 4 am Tuesday, meaning I had been up for 36 hours straight. I slept until 5 pm, and since then I have felt relatively normal, if not a little drained after the experience.

I've had drug problems in the past. Nothing serious compared to a lot of you, but they affected me pretty badly. I was pretty much constantly on cannabis from the ages of 14-22, then switched to alcohol, then benzo's; valium, xanax and clonazepam. All were obtained illegally without a prescription.

Anyhow I decided to got my life together, tapered off the valium over a 6 month period under a doctors supervision. Have been pretty much free from alcohol problems for 3 years, and free from Benzo's for 6 years.

Recently though I've gotten back into the addiction. 

Here is my last few days of dosages.

20th - 8mg xanax and 10mg valium

21st- 12mg xanax and 20mg valium

22nd- 4mg xanax and 30mg valium

23rd - 6mg xanax and 10mg valium

Also I'm only 2 hours into the 24th of Nov, and I've popped 30mg of valium and 2mg of xanax.

These are probably some pretty large numbers for some of you reading this, but small fry for others. I get that, as when I decided to give up the valium all those years ago, I was taking 120mg a day.

Since this is /r/askdrugs :

I'm kind of reaching out for some advice from some experienced users. I am also  adding in clonazepam soon to the mix, which is kind of scaring me. 

I have a stable job with important responsibilities and an extremely hectic family life. I definitely feel that the drug use has negatively affected these things but in other ways I don't get angry and shout (or ignore) my spouse or children like I used to, but the emotional connection is not the same either, not to mention a complete lack of libido.

If anybody out there has some advice as to reducing dosages (getting harder!) I'd appreciate it. Also, please note that at the moment I have no desire to give up these drugs, but I 100% want to be free of them, perhaps 6 months down the line.

I've cut down a lot lately, since my interests have started to point elsewhere. In the last 2 years I've taken medium to high doses of 6-apb multiple times, 2c-x's about ten times, real MDMA 3 or 4, MDMA-like cathinones probably dozens of times (4-mec, methylone, 4-mmc, mdpv), 4-aco-dmt, lsd, DOC, 4-ho-met, etizolam, a LOT of MXE, and I'm sure i'm forgetting some. I've done plenty of other drugs in and before this window, but I feel this time frame and list is the most relevant.

I went to a cardiologist and they told me I have premature ventricular contractions. If you dont know what this is, no offense but you probably won't be able to help me with my question, but i'll explain anyway--my heart tries to pump a little to soon, fails due to lack of blood, then makes up for it with a massive, very noticeable pump. It's usually benign, but it happens to me upwards of a hundred times a day (and that's a VERY conservative estimate).

The thing is, even though it only recently got noticeable, it feels EXACTLY like the best parts of the peak on mdma or cathinones. Which has led to a weird reaction, in which it actually feels kind of good to have these due to the association. Less and less every day, but still some. Also, usually after a PVC it feels like a have a fluttering, kind of sucking-popping feeling in my chest for a few seconds.

This has been going on for a few days. Does anyone have any idea if I should be more worried than my cardiologist said? I'm gonna get it checked out further regardless, but I'm wondering if any of y'all have had any experience with a similar situation.

I'm curious about drugs because they seem to fly in the face of my beautifully-constructed belief systems:

I like to think that self-discipline and self-control leads to a better quality of life.  I like to believe that there are dreams and pursuits and accomplishments that are more worthwhile than the rush of meth or heroine.  I like to think that the world is full of beautiful things and possibilities and that the greatest pleasures in life come from mental activities and achievements.  

I'm working hard to become a musician or composer in the long run.  Plus, I'm studying to be a software engineer so that I have a cash cushion along the way.  Music and other intellectual activities have always meant the world to me, and I've always taken satisfaction in wrapping my mind around something difficult.  I'm smart, impassioned, and love what I do.  If I keep at it I could probably have a future that would make others envious.

Howeveraaaaaaaaa.......

If I tried Crystal Meth, I would LOVE IT!!  It would top all my other life experiences and then some.  Right now I have all these noble ideas about self-control and beauty and ""slowly entering into"" life's peak experiences, but with meth....shit....all that out the window BRO!!  Then what would truly matter in life?  METH!  

There may be a million other philosophical arguments about how such a drug could deny us a grip on reality and the power to shape and understand the world-as-it-is, but I'm at the point in my philosophy-life where I believe the world only exists as we think it does thanks to our mental interpretation.

It might be a little extreme for me to someday just suddenly become a junky, but there's definitely a middle-ground that's quite disturbing to me because of its possibility.  I've read plenty of accounts on reddit of how relatively smart, educated, financially secure people have dabbled in things from coke to meth and...thanks to some careful planning...kept in control.  At the very least, they were able to back off when they had to.  More importantly though, they seemed to look back on it as ""fucking great"" (to quote one guy).  I may not have access to drugs now, but hell, I'm gonna have more money and mobility than my parents never had.

So here I am, an enviable future ahead and I can't get around the implications of these drugs.  I've had amazing experiences with music that I consider spiritual, ""rushing"", profound, and full-body orgasmic (I have HUGELY eclectic tastes so I know where the shit is).  I've also had great experiences with music in more subtle, diverse ways as everyone out there has.  

However, I feel as though I'm lying to myself when I try to justify the idea that music and intellectual activity are truly the golden eggs of human existence (plus art, architecture, James Joyce and whatever else floats your intellect).  

Since I was 6 I've had a conscience that combs itself over for lies.  Even though I want to believe that I've ""found"" what the good life is, my conscience is telling me that I've merely ""constructed"" a pile of bullshit...all of which would rush out the door with the first powdery line.",,False,,t5_2s8ie,1340303076.0,,,True,t3_ve5sw,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/ve5sw/my_serious_intellectual_problem_with_drugs/,

The first psychedelic i did was mescaline. it was beautiful, however, i had to ride in a car to get back home while tripping near the peak. i get car sickness pretty bad, also because i get motion sickness from spinning and similar sensations like not paying attention to the road when driving. i ended up puking    a little while after we had been driving (only for about 10 mins in the car). it seemed like it was the car that started giving me feelings like i was car sick, but i couldnt tell if it was because of that or if the mescaline was making me feel sick (heavy feelings of wavyness like on a small boat can get me sick too).

I did eat a sandwich before i took the pill, and i didnt feel hungry until i ended up puking. i also was eating a bunch of sour patch kids while i was tripping, and puked them all out so idk if that could have also made me feel sick from all the sugar.

what my question is to this community is if drugs like mushrooms, LSD or mescaline can trigger sensations that would fuck with my motion sickness? ive heard about dramamine but im not too sure about what it does since ive heard that u can trip out on it. i would take it if it helped with nausea while tripping but would it effect the trip at all?

Because it was such a complex experience, I'm going to attempt to include all details exactly as I remember them. Much of this will also seem like speculation that I added in afterwards- any such speculation is contained to brackets and parenthesis; everything else I was fully aware of at the time...

I started by putting on ""The Source"" by the Naked and Famous (high-quality over the ear headphones). This song is 48 seconds long. Before it was over, I took another moderately large hit. The song following it, ""The Sun"" started playing. I sat back in my chair and closed my eyes.

The first thing that was unusual was that I could see a very sharp negative-color image of my computer, and entire desk. Images/text on my monitors were not discernable and the screens just looked like light (albeit black light, due to the negative coloring). This lasted for about 30 seconds.

At this point I had a very noticable amount of energy- very out of the ordinary for me. [I'm fairly out of shape and have been for quite a while relative to my lifespan]. My eyes were still closed and I just sat there, fairly energetic, enjoying the music.

I hit about 2:00 in the song and started noticing ""tinglies"" in my fingers and arms, so I laid back again to enjoy them. (eyes still closed). A few seconds after laying back, I was aware that a kind of energy was forming at the top of my brain stem. It accumulated for several seconds, manifesting as a very intense, but recognizable head high and it felt absolutely fantastic. Shortly after that, the energy and the feeling ""exploded"" very slowly. I could feel it expanding throughout my brain and down my spinal column. When I became aware of it moving down my spinal column, I could *see* myself sitting in my chair (my ""vision"" was slightly above and behind my right shoulder; I hesitate to say the 'opening of my minds eye', so to speak, was sudden. It was certainly a fast change, but felt completely natural, just like opening my real eyes), and I could see this energy moving throughout my nervous system. I watched it spread out to [what felt and looked like] every nerve ending in my body. This lasted for what was probably 5-10 seconds. I saw the energy start to dim, so I said in my head ""lets have another one."" I could still see my entire nervous system, and as a direct reaction to my thought, the entire thing lit back up and I had that ""head high"" feeling covering my entire body for another 10-20 seconds until almost exactly 3:30 in the song where it starts to fade down. (The whole thing lasted all of a minute and a half)

I slowly opened my eyes. I felt nearly sober, but I felt perfectly happy and, also unusual for me, a distinct emotional warmth.

I just feel like I've been given a gift from the drugs gods. (""I got all that, for nothing but a bowl of weed!"") Has anyone had similar experiences, or know more about what may actually have been happening (psysiologically speaking)?

It may be useful to know that I really didnt like the job and everyday was a struggle to get to 5pm.  As soon as I get on the road I feel this weird sense of relief and comfort wash over me.  All I can do is sit back in my seat and stare forward at the road.  I feel so absolutely complacent, and for the first time in a long time I can take a truly deep breath.  It feels so good.  My eyes were very heavy, and all I could do was stare straight ahead at the road.  My short term memory was very impaired, as I couldnt remember what gear my car was in (manual transmission) or what radio station I was listening to.  In addition the other cars on the road seemed to be very distant, and it soon became hard to understand the words to the song I was listening to.  Thats when I thought something was wrong and I looked in the mirror.  My pupils were tiny - the smallest I've ever seen them even though it was a really cloudy day.  I know I should have stopped driving at this point, feeling that something was out of the ordinary, but that overwhelming sense of complacency took hold of my decision making.  It was like I didnt care about the possible negative consequences, everything just seemed so good.  I kept driving but noticed other odd things about my decision making, like I couldnt bring myself to change lanes in traffic even if the other lane was moving quicker (something I always do).

No sickness, I won't end up with my head in a toilet by the end of the night and it's generally a very clear and positive experience. I consider myself a very light user and probably roll around 4-6 times a year because of what i've been taught of MDMA's effect on the brain.

I've pulled a short segment out of this document about lab tests of methylone, mephedrone, and mdma on rats.

""On the basis of the 5-HT-releasing capability of mephedrone and methylone, we postulated that the drugs would cause persistent depletion of brain tissue 5-HT, analogous to the effects of SERT substrates like MDMA (Baumann et al, 2008; Commins et al, 1987; Malberg and Seiden, 1998).

Surprisingly, we found that repeated high-dose administration of mephedrone and methylone produce acute hyperthermia and motor stimulation, but no lasting changes in brain tissue monoamines (Figures 7 and 8).

In a parallel group of rats, high-dose MDMA caused marked depletion of 5-HT in the frontal cortex and striatum when examined 2 weeks after treatment (Figure 9). Our data suggest that mephedrone and methylone are less apt to cause 5-HT deficits when compared with other SERT substrates, and this notion is supported by findings with the parent drug""

There's more within the paper, I've mostly skimmed through the various 'results' paragraphs and they seem to support that notion, although I'm not a scientist and it doesn't make the most sense to me.

I'm curious to see some discussion on this and others' opinions.

My Vyvanse prescription is only 20mg, but often I'll redose immediately after it wears off; I often don't have much of a choice, sometimes I *have* to stay up for multiple days to avoid missing class/work/deadlines.  (I do usually manage to fit in a few hours of naptime during these situations)

My two concerns are long term heart damage, and sudden death via stroke or something similar.

I don't particularly want to die yet, but overachieving in these classes is extremely important to me, if only because I want to attend an elite graduate school. (Obviously though, if I kill myself now, that won't happen.)

I'd be infinitely grateful to receive any advice/warnings, especially with the following two questions:

If I'm experiencing a heart attack or something similar, is there a chance it wouldn't be immediately obvious to me? For example, I sleep on the floor, and as a result, I have recurring aches and pains, sometimes in the left side of my chest, from negligible to mild. I take it a heart attack would feel much worse, right?

Also, specifically today, I'm wondering if it's relatively safe to take another. This would be my third consecutive dose. I've had naps in between as usual, but there's no way I could stay conscious enough to study without another pill, and I have two crucial exams tomorrow.

I took LSD for my first time about a week ago. I took half a tab at a concert and then redosed with another half about 4 hours later as I never felt the first tab whatsoever. That time it kicked in and I had a nice, but quite short (~4 hours) lsd trip. I was unhappy that it took so long to kick in, but I figured it was worth it.

I took LSD again last night and it took a whole 1 and a half hours to kick in. I first took half a tab and then took another half a half hour later. It hit me 1.5 hours after that and I took another half, but the effects never really hit me. I just felt extremely spaced our and heavy-headed, it wasnt a bad trip, because it wasnt a trip at all.

What was the problem here? I am quite certain that this is high quality LSD, because I got it from a very good friend who does it regularly and likes this LSD. Was the problem that I smoked weed both of those times? Did I not hold it on my tongue enough? I swallowed it after about 1~5 minutes, would that mean it could not kick in at all? Was the dosage too low?

I want to take LSD again tonight. Should everything go better if I don't smoke weed and take 2 tabs at the same time?

It's not. ALD-52+water=LSD. Meaning, as soon as ALD-52 hits your tongue and touches saliva (which is 99.5% water), it turns into LSD. It may be a different molecule, but it ends up being the same thing. Unless you mainline it or something.

So why do people think it's different from LSD? Because Tim Scully, the guy who made Orange Sunshine, claimed that his tabs were ALD-52, because ALD-52 was not illegal at the time. However, he was just making excuses to get out of jail time. In reality, it's all the same fucking thing.

My questions are regarding environment. I haven't done LSD or Shrooms before but have done MDMA and have gotten some real nice visuals off it, was in a group of 4 with my girlfriend, the aforementioned buddy and another good friend in our duplex flat. We had a great bonding time in one of the rooms with some amazing empathetic feelings, i've recently begun coming out of severe depression and have been able to look back on the time and being overjoyed that I was understood and my qualms were felt by the others. We went out into the forest behind our place afterwards and had a great time there. Is this a sensible plan, or rather would this be as enjoyable on the others? I've read a bit about people saying shrooms are far more introverted and therefore sometimes can be better indoors with some quiet music and a comfy environment, my buddy and I have plans to have a bunch of discussions while on the LSD. I want to make this experience as good as it could be, while keeping it completely safe and 'bad-trip' free as it can be, it's pretty important to me to be honest due to all the great things I've read lately regarding the whole mind-opening concept. We've also planned to get a decent chunk of weed to go with the experiences due to the anti-nausea and balancing effect, on the MDMA it did have a bit of a relaxing sensation that I do remember having qualms about as I'd really enjoyed the rush. Would there be anything like this on the others? I've done my reading but would really like some firsthand opinions/knowledge. 

The other question would be in terms of doing it in a row as in LSD one day shrooms the next etc, or spread over a week period, what would you guys recommend orderwise/timescale-wise?

I've read up on it plenty. My experience with drugs is limited to a few good nights of marijuana use (well, and alcohol a lot more often).

My friend said that she can get me some, but I don't know the dosage now, nothing is final or even really planned out yet.

All I really want to know is what I should try to do about setting. She has tripped once or twice on LSD and recently tripped on 2c-e. I trust her to watch over me and asked if she would sit me (sober) for my first time. She said that it would be better if I had someone with me that was tripping. Unfortunately she cannot trip with me because of issues that don't really need to be discussed. The other problem is that we really don't have a place to do it; the only place that she could think of was her friend's apartment, who she said could trip with me during it, while she sat us.

The problem I have with this is that I've only seen this guy a few times and barely know him. The times I've been with him have been awkward, simply because we're not really similar people and I haven't known him long enough anyway. I'm really reluctant to have my first time go like this because I feel like him simply being there (and being in *his* apartment), could cause my trip to turn out shitty.

She told me that she may be able to trip with me once she's ""ready"" but that could literally be a year or more from now. I've read multiple times that tripping with sober people can be bad, but I'd like to know why, and if it's actually that big of a deal. I'm still not sure where we would go to do it, but I'd like to know if you think it would be okay for me to trip while she soberly watches.

Finally, given these circumstances, would tripping alone be okay? I do expect the trip to be a good one; been thinking positively about it and I feel like I am as emotionally ready as I will ever be, but I'm somewhat reluctant to do it alone, just in case something bad were to happen.

I said I'm not a dealer (which is true), but I can share some of mine if he wants. We met up and he seemed pretty cool. Went back to his apartment and chilled out for a couple of hours, played video games, etc. When we smoked up, he didn't have much at all, maybe half a cone? He said that's because he hasn't smoked in months, and didn't want to pass out straight away. We just chatted about religion, philosophy, Game of Thrones, played Call of Duty. 

Anyway, I said I didn't have any scales, because I just smoke recreationally, I don't sell. But he didn't know anyone in town, so I offered to hook him up in a few days. I left him a couple grams for free (because I'm a nice guy). 

I'm not gonna lie, I'm paranoid. The cons are: he contacted me on the Internet. He didn't have much to smoke, so could've technically bum smoked it. He offered to pay above market price because he was so grateful after going a few months without anything. Pros are: he invited me into his house for two/three hours!

Is it worth supplementing alongside, similar to MDMA? I remember reading a thread about 2c-b neurotoxicity and the consensus was that it basically wasn't neurotoxic, but would it help the comedown if there is one? I have acetyl-l-carnitine, alpha linoic acid, green tea extract, grape seed extract, a bunch of electrolyte/vitaminy effervescent tablets, 5-htp and melatonin. Is it worth at all taking 5-htp afterwards. I know it affects serotonin but in a different way to MDMA?

2. Is it stimulating? Am I going to have trouble sleeping afterwards?

3. What dose would you recommend for a first time? I am going to go for about 23-25mg.

4. How does it mix with alcohol/cannabis? This will be a party so I will probably have a few drinks to start with, unless this is a bad idea/will affect the high? I do not like weed ordinarily as it just sends me to sleep but really enjoyed coming down off MDMA while smoking it; would smoking it at the end of a 2c-b trip be good in the same way (I guess the question is, is 2c-b stimulating enough to counteract the sleepy effects of weed?)

1352944299.0,7,self.askdrugs,137rrh,Can anybody answer some questions I have about what happened when I went off of and then back on medication? (Wellbutrin and Zoloft),demwhiteboys,8,1,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/137rrh/can_anybody_answer_some_questions_i_have_about/,"To make a long story shor,t I was on both medications (100mg each) for four years to treat my anxiety, OCD, and ADHD. Last summer I decided that I wanted to try to go off of the medications, so under the instruction of the doctor who had proscribed them I stopped the Wellbutrin cold turkey and tapered off the Zoloft over a few months.  I felt weird and different all summer but once I started school again I realized how hard it was for me to concentrate, learn, and understand new information.  It felt like I had a learning disability and that my cognitive function was impaired.  I waited it out a month before deciding that I could not continue feeling this way and, under the instruction of my doctor went back on both medicines (Wellbutrin 100mg and Zoloft 50mg). 

It has been two full months since then and I still feel this way, I feel as if my brain does not work as well as it should and that I am having significant trouble learning.  I do feel a bit better but not much.  Not to mention, since starting the medicines again I have a pretty much constant headache and ear popping sensation.  It is not incredibly painful, but it is distracting and uncomfortable and worrisome.

If it makes any difference, for the last two years I have smoked cannabis everyday as a recreational activity.  I smoked while going off the medicines, but stopped once I started school when I realized I was having trouble learning and focusing.  I would still smoke on the weekends, but only take a hit or two because my highs felt different and a bit weird.

Last weekend, after having 3 beers and a few hits (I had also gotten very little sleep that week due to a big project) I started feeling sick.  I was not intoxicated, but my body began to shake and it was very scary.  I did not have a seizure, but it felt as if I had Parkinson's disease. I went to bed and woke up feeling fine.  

Here is what I think happened based on my research up to this point and how I've been feeling.  I think that by going off the Wellbutrin cold turkey (and in general) that my brain was having a hard time regulating the neurotransmitters that are in charge of learning, attention, and concentration.  I think that being off the Zoloft made me feel more anxious and that did not help the problem.  I also think that since going back on the Wellbutrin my brain has now had to adjust back to the medicine which is causing the headache.  

I am unsure where to go from here.  I have a doctor's appointment Wednesday but really want to get some more opinions on the matter from any professionals or other patients on here.  Should I wait it out another month and maybe the headaches will go away?  Should I try another medication?  I really do not want to play around with my brain chemistry and fuck myself over, nor do I want to feel as if I have a disability when I did not previously.  

Are there any medications, supplements, or vitamins that I can take to help regenerate the parts of by brain affected by the Wellbutrin?  Are there any other medications that could fix this problem?  Is there any subreddit that will be of more help?  

I love my life and I just want to feel better.  I have decided not to drink or smoke until I am confident that my mental and physical states are back to normal.  However, I do want to be able to start smoking and drinking again because that is what all my friends at home and college do, and quite frankly I really enjoy both activities and the fun that I have while doing them.  This is NOT important though I just want to feel like myself again.

TL;DR   Went off Wellbutrin and Zoloft and experienced an inability to learn properly, trouble concentrating and paying attention, and generally felt out of it and as if I had a learning disability.  I think that the Wellbutrin is to blame, and that my neurotransmitters were messed up.  Hoped that by going back on the medications it would fix the problem but since being back on for two months I still feel stupid and out of it and not myself and not to mention I now have a headache constantly.  I am wondering if there are any drugs, vitamins, or supplements that can fix the imbalances this has created of that can help regenerate the parts of my brain that have been affected.  Should I stay on both medications and see if the headache goes away?  Should I switch medicines?  Any suggestions are welcome and I would prefer people with expertise in this area.

Although I am friends with a few experienced psychonauts, none of them have been able to help me understand the experiences I have been having recently.  This may be a bit lengthy since I want to include as many details as possible, but I would love any info that anyone has to offer.

The tl;dr: weed makes me trip balls.

Allow me to explain from the beginning.  During my high school years I was not what I would call a marijuana user.  I would smoke with friends once or twice a year, but otherwise put studies before drugs in order to prepare myself for college.  This past summer, after I graduated, I slowly increased my use to about once every two weeks or so.

For quite awhile my reactions to the drug were average and normal.  Not much out of the ordinary.  Then, one day, I decided to smoke for a second day in a row with a friend and an acquaintance.  We biked out into the woods and lit up.  After a single hit and some coughing I knew something was odd.  The high washed over me like a tidal wave, and for a few minutes all I could do was stand in one place and stare into the distance.  After my friend pointed out I was pale I managed to sit down on a log.  I'm a fairly resilient person so it didn't really upset me, but I was very aware that I was having a bad trip of sorts.
I laid down on my side and waited for the incredibly intense feelings to pass, after which I was able to stand up, drink some water, and walk it off.  As the feeling subsided, I was left with an ordinary high.

That was the last time I smoked before college.

In college I was placed into the artsy-stoner-hippy-hipster dorm, so I became friends with a large number of smokers.  I smoked a little in the first few days with some new friends and hard and noticed nothing strange, so I figured that my overwhelming experience in the woods had been a one time deal.

One friend had visited Colorado over the summer and returned with a large number of goods.  Among her loot was a brownie she gave to me because she felt it tasted disgusting.  So, I ate the brownie, and thus began my strange experiences with the herb.

The trip from the brownie was *intense.*  I had never experienced anything like it.  Time would slow down then snap back into the present.  I heard electronic beeping and whistling noises in the background.  Objects--especially objects with sharply defined shapes to them--would seem to throb and glow.  When I looked at an object and blinked, a phosphene-like afterimage of it would appear when my eyes were closed, and remain in my vision when I opened my eyes...  Then it would tessellate across the rest of my vision.  As I neared the peak of trip and lay on someone's bed clutching a pillow, I began to see a sort of spiral that looks incredibly similar to the one [here](http://i.imgur.com/nutU2.jpg).  It would simply appear over my vision, shifting and changing colors.  This wasn't a true hallucination per se, but more of a visual effect, the same as if you blink while looking at a bright light and see glowing shapes.

At first I chalked the experience up to the brownie, but ever since that day I've had a random assortment of those very strong side-effects from just a few hits of weed.  Sometimes I hear noises, sometimes I feel a sensation like water against my skin, and sometimes time slows and snaps.  Almost every single time I see the same strange spiraling image.

It's been months now and I still have these effects.  Don't get me wrong, I both enjoy them and embrace them.  Every time I smoke it's a sort of spiritual experience.  I am, however, very interested in finding out why this happens to me and whether or not it is safe for me to continue smoking.

Last weekend I was fortunate enough to get my hands on some acid (2 hits), but I didn't take it because I was already on mushrooms. I had also done mushrooms the two previous weekends (so three weekends straight).

As I was thinking about this electronic show, I realized I have an opportunity to candy flip. The only problem is I've never done acid before. (Well, I've given it two tries, but didn't trip either time). I know this stuff is legit, though. I was thinking about giving it a test run this weekend, but I really think I should probably just give myself a break this weekend.

That being said, do you think I'd be ok trying it for the first time in a candy flip? I'm relatively experienced rolling (probably 8 or 9 times), and I've done mushrooms a decent number of times. If I were to do it, I'd probably take the acid a few hours before going to the show, and then taking the roll after the first opener (there are 3 people performing total), so I'd have a decent amount of time to feel out the acid, and I've heard it's better to time it so you're coming down on both around the same time instead of still tripping while coming down from MDMA.

I would only take one hit, so I'd still have another one to do completely on its own at a later date.

If not, how long could I reasonably keep the acid without it going bad? It's on sweet-tarts if that helps, and I'm keeping it in my freezer. There's another event in late November that I'm going to and will probably roll at. Would it keep long enough to be able to candy flip then instead, giving me some time between now and then to do it on its own?

God dammit. My posts always end up way too long.

And safer?) Than illegal markets? I don't know the exact terminology but would the drugs likely be 'cleaner' and more 'pure' and 'quality' ? Increasing the appeal to buy legal, and decreasing the health risks?

They usually hurt, and the first time it happened I thought I was having a heart attack. It is a very weird, uncomfortable, sensation that I definitely do not enjoy getting.

It wasn't my first experience with the drugs, I had done a half tab while camping about a week prior. Obviously the two experiences between a half tab and full tab were vastly different with the latter being much more intense. I spent a good couple hours in a state of confusion, really not too sure what to do with myself. The people I was with were all tripping too, some rolling as well, so needless to say they were all over the place and it wasn't really my scene so that made me slightly uncomfortable.

After some time though I was able to calm down a bit and that was about the same time I started seeing what was essentially a tunnel-like thing appear in my vision. I was laying down looking at the sky and noticed this vortex of sorts comprised of flashing, colored blobs with some morphing into a more elongated state and then back into a stubby state.

So here's a rough sketch of what I was seeing. It didn't occupy my whole visual field, just the center-most portion of it. If you can, imagine the black lines were instead lines of glowing red, blue, and green and then morphing, etc.

Just want to know if this is a normal type of hallucination because everything I've read/seen involves geometric patterns of squares, sharp lines and corners, etc.

I should add, this wasn't the first drug I've used. I smoked weed consistently for the last 3 years but quit this summer because it was just making me paranoid as fuck, even around friends. Didn't have that kind of experience on lucy I should add.

* The ungrateful fuckers who are my friends decide they have gone off the idea in term time
* Decide it's the last time I buy drugs for them

I have tripped quite a lot but 3 is the most I have ever taken and it was by accident and a long time ago (the first dose I ever dropped), so I don't quite remember it well enough to compare it properly with other trips which are more recent and only on 1 tab.

I've had a burning curiosity about it, though, as I've never tried it before.

I've been prescribed Adderall for about 3 years now, but despite being diagnosed as ADHD, I use it recreationally. My mother is a former methhead who would buy a few adderall off of me whenever I'd get it refilled, to get a bit of a ""dulled methlike buzz."" Today she threw a little piece of meth at me, as she occasionally (once every few months) decides to make a pickup, just because. I had been asking her if it does the same as Adderall, only more intensified, and she wouldn't give me a solid answer. 

So I ask you guys: should I use it, what will it do, and can I just swallow it like a pill? I really don't want to smoke it...

UPDATE! I swallowed the first bit mom had given me, and now I asked to try smoking it. Mom almost seemed proud and jumped at the chance to show me, then offered to give me her spare bubble and a little bit to last me a while. I CAN CONTROL MY DRUG USAGE!!! It will not be turning into any kind of huge problem, nothing like that. Just simply a ""boost"" for my artwork, just as the adderall is.

UPDATE 2: Thank you guys for steering me away from it; I just wanted to try it, and that's all that's going to result from it. I wound up actually sleeping at about 5 this morning, I woke up about an hour ago, and I honestly don't understand what's so highly addictive about it. If it takes longer to feel that effect then okay, I'll deal with it then, but right now I honestly don't have any desire to do it again whatsoever, and I almost want to stop taking my adderall completely. I don't like how I feel like scum doing it, and physically I just don't like it.

I was always a little sloppy and would skip days, miss the first pill by six hours and take the second one anyway.

About one and a half months ago I believe I messed up and took two pills instead of one. I'm not even completely certain I did this. (If I was certain I took the first I would not have taken the second.) I also took 250mg naproxen for period cramps.

I came into work and found myself unable to focus and sweating and having shaky hands and weak knees. I was sent home.

On my way home I made a phone call to my mother and discovered I had developed a stutter to the extent that speech bordered on hopeless and my arms and legs, especially on the left side of my body, started to jerk uncontrollably. Big motions, like when you touch something piping hot and you involuntarily jerk away.

Upon arriving home I turned on some music and started getting down on the living room carpet. Put simply, I was euphoric.

My mother found this far more worrisome than I did at the time so she took me to the emergency room and the ER sent me to a hospital. While waiting I discovered that my symptoms were a lot milder when there was nothing happening around me. I could speak normally for several seconds at a time. The doctors and neurologists argued as to what the cause of my reaction could be. One doctor said it's a less than one-in-a-million chance that it was the pills. A neurologist said it *had* to be the sertraline. I forget whose theory it was, but it was said it had to be serotonin syndrome.

The tests they ran on me that day discovered nothing and I was sent home, told not to take my pills. A couple of days later they did a blood test that was to show what drugs were still in my blood. Nothing. They did a head scan too. Still nothing.

The part that confuses me the most is how persistent some symptoms were: The sweating went away the same day and the euphoria the day after, but the stutter, the weak knees and the ridiculous amount of jerking persisted for nearly two weeks. I did not take sertraline for three days when the withdrawals became too much. On recommendation from a psychiatrist I started up again with only 50mg daily. It did not have any effect on the spasms or anything else.

Does anyone know what to make of this? Heard of anything like it? Are there any drugs I ought to stay away from? I've taken circa 200µg of LSD on three occasions, once after this ordeal, without any problems.

I was starting to reach more important issues, but I've begun to fear that the more important issues would be buried too deep for the casual visitor (plus, half the posters erroneously think I'm on the verge of snorting meth).  In addition to starting a new thread I started a new username.  That last one was a terrible idea.  This one should...mhm...get a point across?  Finally, I want a real discussion.  If this isn't serious-discussion-ville for this topic, would you mind giving me directions?

Without further ado:

.......................

What is really the driver behind our actions?  Why do we live the way we do and for what ends?  Is it really just pleasure and pain, reward and punishment?  I doubt it's that simple.  

There seems to be a conflict in how we think of the terms ""motivation"" and the term ""pleasure"".  Normally, we think of the brain as ""motivated by pleasure"" and ""motivated by the avoidance of pain"".

We'll start with a thought experiment:

When a person does Meth for instance, I've read that a lot of them start cleaning their house or ""outlining novels"".  Isn't there something strange here?  What happens to the person?  There's the euphoria orgasm blah blah blah, but then there's sudden motivation to do house chores.  

Think about that.  We normally think of house chores as requiring self-discipline.  They require you to see something that needs to get done and then do it whether or not it's a pain in the ass.  We would probably say that Meth gave them the motivation to do things they wanted to get done.  But is this motivation towards pleasure or avoidance of pain?  That seems ridiculous.  The person is already pretty maxed-out as far as pleasure and painlessness is concerned.  Why wouldn't the meth-man start running after ice cream or sex or...to be blunt...more Meth?  

Maybe eventually the person will just go for more Meth, and maybe that's how binging happens (I don't know).  But at least those first times, why does ""feeling great and euphoric"" make a person start doing chores?

Everything in my life was beautiful and I was happy all the time. I tripped with friends probably at least once a month all year, a few times by myself and I always had an amazing time and came out feeling better about my life, myself, and the world. 

However, the last time I took acid I think it was either bad acid or somehow two tabs was too much (I had taken three in the past and been fine, so I thought I knew what I was getting into with two). The first six hours or so were great, hung out with a bunch of good friends outside in nature who were also tripping on some substance or another. When we went back inside I thought smoking weed would be a good idea, so I took two huge bong rips without even thinking about it. About five minutes later everything started to go insane. I felt like everyone's faces were swirling around me and talking and I couldn't understand why we were all inside this tiny room with crazy lights, and the music was chaotic and stressful and I kept asking people what was going on and no one could really give me an answer. I felt like I was standing on the very edge of this cliff looking down into this gaping black hole of madness and I was about to fall in and go insane forever unless I pulled myself back. I ended up curled up in a ball in the corner just trying to hide from everyone with the one sober friend comforting me. The whole experience only lasted about five minutes before I started to get back in touch with reality and calm down, but for the rest of the trip I had no idea what my relationship was with any of my friends and had to try to rebuild them in my mind from scratch based on how they were interacting with me. I also kept thinking that everyone else was sober and I was the only one still tripping, that they were all normal and thought that I was insane, which was not the case at all. 

I realize that compared to a lot of stories about bad trips on here that's not that bad, but it was the scariest thing that I had ever experienced. For the next four or five days I was scared to leave my house, but I didn't even know what I was scared of, only that I didn't want strangers to be able to see me. After those first few days I managed to bounce back and now I'm pretty much back to my old self, except for being slightly more socially anxious. I haven't tried acid since then (it was about 3-4 months ago). I tried a light dose of shrooms and it was fine, but I experienced a lot more anxiety on it than I had had before. I used to love acid so much, I want to be able to capture that warmth and beauty I experienced on it before, but I'm so scared to go anywhere near that black hole again. I'm also worried the more psychadelics I take the more anxious I will become. Should I do it again to make peace with it? Or stay away from it for good? Thanks for the help :)

tl;dr: bad trip on acid- try again, or leave it alone?

Need advice..,throwmeaway1111111,11,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/skq8j/mdma_and_chest_pain_need_advice/,"Two nights ago I took two pills, the second one about an hour after the first. The print wasn't clear on them, but I think it was an alien head or a skull of some sort. I consider myself to be experienced with MDMA, though it had been a year since my last time doing it, in the past I was consuming pills probably every other weekend. The experience itself went pretty good, nothing spectacular, but nothing bad happened either, until I wanted to go to bed, that is. I knew I was coming down, was a little frustrated with not being able to sleep, but I knew that happens regularly depending on what the pill is based with. I started around 9:30PM, officially called it a night at 3:00AM. After laying there for an hour, my chest started to hurt incredibly bad. It wasn't sharp or sudden, but more of a constant squeezing/pressure. I had to breathe a lot deeper to get enough air, and deep breaths hurt worse than the ongoing chest pain. My significant other had to do some stuff that day, so I was trying to be kind and let him sleep, but it just wouldn't stop hurting! Eventually I gave up on trying to sleep and took a shower, ate some food later in the day. 

The problem is, my chest still hurts. It's right in between my breasts (sternum?) primarily, but is also underneath my left breast a bit too. I'm still breathing heavier than usual, and my lips are super dry and semi-purple in color. I am hydrated (to the best of my knowledge), have been taking multi-vitamins, and I managed to get about 10 hours of sleep last night. I have NEVER had a reaction to a pill like this before, and I'd really like to know if anyone else has experienced ongoing chest pain after taking MDMA. Is it more likely that these pills weren't MDMA, but something more sinister/harmful? I also smoked a bit of weed and took what I thought to be Alprazolam (Xanax), but S/O told me the next day that the pills that were in the Xanax bottle were actually either Ibuprofen 800mg or Acetaminophen. Also, I did this in the comfort of my own home, and I did not dance or physically exert myself at all, really.

TL;DR: Took 2 ecstasy pills, smoked smoke weed, and took an Ibuprofen 800MG/Acetaminophen in one night. I have moderate to severe chest pain even two days later. Am I going to be okay? Should I go to the hospital? What could be wrong internally? Did I take the wrong thing? Did I have a minor heart attack without fully realizing it? Any advice would be greatly, greatly appreciated.

This condition is depicted in the TV show _Prison Break_ through Michael Scofield, in Sherlock (BBC) through Sherlock, Sherlock Holmes (the American movie), Lie To Me (through Cal Lightman), and in The Mentalist (Patrick Jane). 

As many of you may know, psychedelics reduce the conscious filters and allow you to see and experience a larger range of the human experience through increased information throughput. I believe that Nikola Tesla - having read his autobiography - was afflicted with low latent inhibition as well. My question lies in regards to the use of psychedelic drugs for the purposes of lowering latent inhibition - but instead of just having this experience every now and then, I'd like to hear AskDrugs thoughts on the matter of using psychedelics subchronically or chronically to induce this state of modus of operandi. 

As many of you may know there's one potential caveat for most psychedelics, notably 5-HT2B agonism which could cause pulmonary fibrosis, and the like. The drug I have been thinking about is 4-AcO-DMT, which -- as far as I know --  has negligible affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor, but I could be wrong; so please do correct me, in case I am. 

I'd appreciate any thoughts on the matter. 

Thank you.

Nothing seemed to be worthwhile and a sustainable form of happiness seemed simply impossible to attain. I started reading up on Buddhism and found a life style that really spoke to me, I even travelled to Thailand afterwards and discovered the most beautiful culture I could have ever imagined. 

These discoveries helped me find happiness again, but my previous view of the world was shattered. I still couldn't find it in me to believe that anything but the moment truly mattered. In high hopes of possibly seeing things more clearly a fascination with psychedelics formed within me. So just a few weeks ago I did mushrooms for the first time. I've been smoking weed for about a year now, but that has really been my only drug experimentation. 

On mushrooms my existential crisis became entirely justified. I felt like a haze had been lifted and in my mind I could view everything clearly and truthfully. I felt like I experienced the universe and there was nothing there. It reinforced the idea that reality is all in the mind and I felt like we just trick ourselves into thinking that our lives have purpose. To me, I was seeing everything clearly and when I would come down I'd go back to tricking myself into believing that it all matters. 

Last night I smoked some weed and had very vivid flashbacks of my shrooms trip. I regained all of the thoughts and feelings I had while on shrooms, I just wasn't as fucked up as I was when on the shrooms. Once again the haze lifted and I saw everything crystal clear. All the lies we tell ourselves to make meaning of this place vanished and I found myself wanting it to go away. I found myself saying (quite desperately at times, this lasted for a while), ""Fuck it, if nothing really matters I just want to go back to believing it does so I can enjoy my time here before I die."" 

I understand that this is quite enlightening and I wouldn't trade it away, but it kinda scared me to do other psychedelics. I still can't get myself to believe that anything matters but the sweet lies my mind uses to create my reality are sure comforting. I can at least live happily. 

Have you guys ever experienced this sort of existential depression with psychedelics? I'm not really sure where to go from here. Do I just need help? Have I found a place where I should stop? Or should I see how future psychedelic use like more mushrooms, LSD, and DMT make me view existence?

I'm just curious about what kind of security/police I would be likely to encounter in Vegas. For example, where I'm from, police are likely to pop up at train stations near music festivals with dogs, and have them stationed at the entrances too (but never inside), but you do get a few undercovers inside.

I'm assuming there are going to be dogs outside the festival, but do you regularly get them wandering around in Vegas (I'm aware things might be tighter for EDC week)?

Also, are festival guards generally overzealous? Lately over here there has been a trend to go for the whole pat/rubdown/dismantle your lip balm to check for drugs thing going on.

We've had an amazing and loving relationship, with very little conflict between us.s While sex isn't a huge part of our relationship, it has been a little hard on my girlfriend because she has a hard time experiencing pleasure. What's worse, she blames herself for making our sex life less enjoyable for me. I've tried all kinds of things to make it work out for her- I really want her to get as much out of sex as I do, and I hate that she feels so bad about how things are. Lately I've been wondering if a small dose of MDMA could help with this.

TL;DR I'm looking to enhance pleasure for my girlfriend during sex. Could MDMA help with this?

Some context:
-I'm planning on using pure molly, not X in a pill form.

-I planning on using the bare minimum; I'm not looking for a crazy trip here.

-This is all consensual, my SO and I have discussed it in detail

-We would both take it, not just her.

-Neither of us are typically drug users. We've drank and smoked a little, but nothing major before. This is very much uncharted territory for us.

I've done some research and asked friends about this, but I want to be as certain as possible: does sex on MDMA really ruin the experience later? A lot of people I know seem to think its an urban legend.

The texture was similar of the texture of powder coke rather than any sort of crystal formations. 'Greg', had approximately 0.5 - 0.8 g around 40 hours ago. My best guess of how long it took to kick in is 20 minutes, and completely rolling an hour later. Both railed and parachuted. Greg says the trip started off with him having feelings of empathy, and started to have a highly optimistic outlook on everything. Extremely obviously rolling.

He then began professing himself, and essentially confessing everything everything to fellow tripper. This went on for around 9 hours, until early the next morning. Wonderful experience for the both of them. Greg was on a considerably higher level than everyone else, with very dilated pupils and slight chewing on bottom lip, which is common for sober Greg. Also feels the want to talk to other people about underlying life issues, extremely uncommon for Greg. All's going very well so far.

9 hours later, Greg has come down quite a few levels but doing the same things, except with more difficultly forming sentences, and stuttering. Greg stayed awake and was sitting down talking to fellow tripper, talking as much as sober Greg would but was quite a bit less stoked. Acting somewhat close to sober but still quite noticeably high. Greg got up to walk to the bathroom, and experienced a very quick head rush and having to catch himself on a wall. So we made Greg toast, and he ate the toast slowly. Greg and Gregs girlfriend both felt a random strong pulse in his stomach, greg's heart rate wasnt very regular and he said he could feel his heart more. Its now later in the afternoon a day after dosing, around 22 hours after first dose, he tries to sleep but gives up after 2 hours.

After a quiet day day at home, it was Gregs second sleepless night, at around 3am, 35 hours after he dosed. He was walking irregularly but drank water and had a small amount of vegetables, his communication skills are noticeably impaired and isnt looking too good. Made his second attempt at sleeping after reading but failed after a few hours. Greg is experiencing overlapping vision and blurryness, and pupils are still very dialated.

As I am writing this around 42 hours after first dosage, and Greg is not particularly enjoying things

Last week, I had some MDMA and Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds in my possession while with some friends.  Everyone was rolling, including myself, when one of my friends decided that we should try the HBW seeds tonight. A few of the friends there that night had done them previously and gave us the thumbs-up to go for it.

I had taken 200mg of the MDMA and was coming up quickly when I ground up 6 of the seeds. My other friend was on the same amount and had 10 seeds. 

Now, I'd never done LSA before. I'd also never combined MDMA with any drug other than marijuana. I almost thought that the LSA wasn't doing anything for me after three hours with no noticeable effects. At the peak of my roll, I noticed the infamous vasoconstriction in my legs as well as some nausea (which I attributed to mild dehydration and the taste of the drip).

During my peak, I was in a state of absolute euphoria. If someone had taken a picture of me at this time, it'd be evident that I was losing my shit hugging a teddy bear as if it tied me to the world. That lasted for an hour, and it was during this time I started to notice a change in headspace. Everything going on around me was put on the back burner, and I was left to my own thoughts. However, the world around me was completely clear to me. I was able to hear and pay attention to the conversation in the room while still talking to myself.

An hour after this, I noticed the visuals I had probably been experiencing the entire time but just never taken the time to notice. Flares, tracers, and breathing objects were evident everywhere I looked, and they only gained intensity as the time dragged on. The minutes going by seemed like hours, and I was only able to gauge time passed by whenever a song would end. At about 4:30 in the morning, we decided it was time to turn the lights off and chill out, get some sleep if possible. It wasn't possible for me, though the friend who had taken 10 seeds was already peacefully unconscious.

This was where things took a turn for the sinister. The bright bulb from the ceiling fan turned off, we left a small red bulb in the corner turned on. Everything instantly became menacing. I was entranced on the couch, staring at two overlapping wires that looked like the Devil himself. With everyone around me dead silent, it didn't take long for me to freak out. I started feeling my nose, and the cartilage on the left side was gone. It was simply gone. Had I really done that much damage to my nose in such a short time? I had only insufflated amphetamine salts once, methamphetamine a couple times, and MDMA a few times. I always alternated nostrils when insufflating, too. How was this possible?  That was the train of thought I was stuck in. Each time my thoughts shifted, a different voice was produced by my subconscious, but it was my voice every time. THEN, my smoking came into the equation. Do I have cancer? I probably have cancer. Holy shit, I smoke half a pack a day, that's way too much. Smoking weed isn't going to help me fight it. I need to quit. My chest hurts.

That fucked me up for hours in the 20-minute timespan that it went down. Each issue that came up, I would eventually find peace in it, tell myself I was going to live with it and deal with it and have the experience to use later. A story for another generation. A tale for someone about to make a mistake. After it was all done (or so I thought), I lay back and closed my eyes in what I can only assume was bliss. I noticed my body drift off, and the only thing that existed was this *feeling*. I realized that I loved everyone and everything that came into my life, and I was grateful for every experience I had, good or bad. I was at absolute peace, and felt that it would be beautiful to die in this moment. I wanted to die, to be dead. I didn't want to kill myself, just to be dead.

I think it's that period of bliss that's giving me trouble now, almost a week later. I didn't sleep at all that night, and couldn't get restful sleep until the following evening. I've been doing much better since that first day after, but ever since then I've felt almost completely drained of emotion. I'm happier when I'm with my friends, but it is nothing close to what I could feel. I've been taking 5-HTP twice daily for five days now, but the depression is still there, if even a little bit. I have also had thoughts of death more frequently than ever before. None of them are suicidal, but I find myself contemplating dying a lot now.

**TL;DR**

Has anyone before combined these two drugs and had this sort of hangover? Do you have any recommendations for getting rid of the depression, or is doing what I'm doing the best thing right now?

________________________________________________________________________________________

I have to say, I really enjoyed last night and its experiences. I now feel more at ease with what happened and almost feel reborn in a way. I will write up a basic time line for our adventures in my house/garden. Times will be rough so I'll try and stick it to the closes 10 mins increments, 

**9:30pm** - Pick up the guys from their house and go to shops to get some fruit juice and flavored water.

**10:00pm** - Arrive back at the house and start vaping to ease the nerves.

**10:30pm** - Sit down and stare at the sugar cubes in front of us, this was incredible weird moment for me. I knew it wouldn't make me sick or anything nor would I notice anything going on at first but at that moment I was standing on the edge of the grand canyon and decided I'll take that step and not look back.

**11:30pm** - Watching Dazed and Confused film to settle down a bit, notice I feel pretty good and a bit spacey not like high from cannabis something else. Ask the guys if they feel anything and they just say the same. Starting to get thoughts to what if there was nothing on the sugar, if my close mate had just messed with me.

**12:00pm** - We go out into my garden as guys want to smoke, I have long garden with lights at the top so the light dissolves into the darkness at the end of my garden. I see shapes in the trees and bushes but I just think its just my mind normally finding patterns.

**12:30am** - We continue watching Dazed and Confused starting to loose track of whats going on, starting to find stupid things funny like the Logo for the pool hall they hang out in is just billiard balls in bright colours. 

**01:00am** - I can feel it now, feel a sense of harmony and peacefulness. There's a fight scene coming up on the film and the tensions building, I don't like it its bringing me down. So I turn it off and instantly switch to Fantasia. Holy hell I think watching the first 5 mins of that is what pushed us over the edge. 

**01:20am** - Were outside, the guys are smoking and we can start to really feel it coming now. Everything it just making us laugh our heads off, even something as stupid as Arnie impersonations. We go back in and I shove on some music, [Negativland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY0ASHW3604). We stare at the screen laughing our heads off not knowing what the fucks is going on. Some older tracks are just random clips of people talking over sound effects, this stuff is amazing.

**02:00am** - Really starting to peak as we go back to watching Sky, flipping through the channels, we stop at a British cops program. It's interesting but after 10 mins they start breaking into someones house who's going insane and hides in the loft. All the aggression is making me uncomfortable, without asking the guys I just turn over I can be handling that crap right now. We land on South Park and watch part of an episode before I find Ancient Aliens and think ""O this will be fun"", yeah bad mistake. I think the scariest thing was what they were saying was making sort of sense and that's when we realized we should prob go for another smoke.

**02:30am** - We come back in and Dog the Bounty Hunters on TV yelling at his wife, this sets us off going nuts. All the time I start to notice on the ceiling the skirting is pulsing, it seems like its expanding and contracting almost like its a living entity but yet I do not feel scared more interested. I end up starring at the ceiling for what feels like hours but was only like 5 mins. I decide we need something a bit more stable for our mind set so I find 'Adventure Time'. I don't think I've laughed so hard for so long, it got to points were I was so tired of laughing I wanted to stop but I just couldn't. I had also grabbed duvet that was on the floor and make my own little bed while watching TV. I did start to notice the temperature fluctuations with my body, one min I'd be cold next I'd be sweating was really disorientating but I just didn't focus on it. 

**03:00am** - Starting to relax again now, things are still all over the place and thinking patterns are impossible to record on here but I was having the time of my life. I feel mentally drained, never felt this drained before like I had been on Holiday for a month travelling through the Amazon. 

**03:30am** - We are all back on stable ground, thoughts are still running wild but controllable. Hallucinations are vivid but easy to ignore, we are all knackered and looking at the time we don't understand how its only been a few hours when it feels like years. The guys say they should head home, I tell them there's warm beds up stairs if they want to crash but they have work in the afternoon and need some rest. I watch them leave and go back to the lounge. I feel restless, confused and mental fatigued.

**04:00am** - I decide to go up to bed and see if I can sleep.

**05:00am** - Still watching Adventure Time in bed waiting for my mind to relax so I can sleep.

**12:30pm** - I wake up in a pool of sweat and jump straight out of bed, I expect to feel horrible or at least knackered but no I feel amazing. It's almost like I sweated out all the evils from me and left me with a clean shell. I notice my hands feel like rubber and are all crinkly from sweating non stop. I shower which feels awesome and now finishing up this record.


*Overall*

This experience has been an incredible journey, looking back to how much I was anxious when looking at that sugar cube and the feeling of triumph when I swallowed it. It wasn't what I was expecting, I thought maybe the whole world would just melt and I'd be left in this weird place but no it was beautiful. Would I ever do it again?

1351279737.0,7,self.askdrugs,1250ls,MDMA hallucinations,trollsbetrolling,11,4,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/1250ls/mdma_hallucinations/,"The last couple times I was rolling I hallucinated every time for hours. I'm rather happy about this, as they're my favorite visual by far, and I've found a rough guideline that works for me in bringing them out consistently. Despite erowid and other sources saying hallucinations are uncommon on MDMA, there are many reports floating around of people describing them. Bluelight has a lot of anecdotal stories, but overall this doesn't seem very well documented and I was hoping to gain some more insight.

Let me try and describe them. The first effect is what I call the grid, and it looks like [this](http://www.easyvectors.com/assets/images/vectors/afbig/dots-square-grid-04-pattern-clip-art.jpg)  . It fills your vision completely, the dots will usually be roughly the same hue, but can change color all at once. They're static in that they don't move. Most apparent on solid surfaces without much detail, it's an like an overlay that will be there with you the entire time. Sometimes strong edges in your visual field will have lines moving along them, there's very little breathing and morphing like on psychedelics during all of this.

While observing the dots, you can sort of unfocus and there will be little swirls and turbulences. I should probably say this is easiest in a dimly lit area, just laying there and gazing around. The best way to put what happens next is that your brain tries to find shapes in the turbulences. At first there will be outlines of objects. Often enough they will leave the surface they appeared on, and move around in 3D space. It can be tricky to focus on them. When the hallucinations are stronger there might be texture added to them and it doesn't look much different from a real object anymore. The objects are mostly random, but I've also been successful in making up my own by willing it into existence. Some personal highlights include: glasses on other people, cars, rabbits getting chased in a park, dinosaurs on the walls, lots of text that I can't remember scrolling on the walls, and spiders rushing down from the ceiling on little strings. One time I imagined a friend of mine sitting on the couch and I could start seeing her outlines appear. I've also watched a movie on the ceiling for a while. Another time I heard a river flowing on my floor, however auditory stuff is usually pretty rare. I tried to grab one of the spiders the first time because I wasn't sure, but I'm usually always aware that they aren't real.

Closing your eyes, the imagery becomes very vivid and dream-like. It can get pretty bizarre, like rabbits being massacred by chainsaws to give you an idea. I never found it scary no matter how fucked up it was. It's very reminiscent of hypnagogia as I imagine it. There can be a story to it, much like watching a movie half asleep. Not much more I can say about the CEVs, as I find the OEVs to be much more interesting and never bothered much with them. It's extremely easy to pass out during this, even 1 hour after peaking... I wasted some quality time by accidentally falling asleep.

It happened the 4th or 5th time in a row yesterday. It was MDMA, nothing else, you can take my word or read the accounts of other people who had the same things happen. Breaks in between were sufficient, I try to not be stupid with MDMA. Dosages were generally around or below 200mg, with one redose of half the initial dose at 60-90min. The key for me is vigorous consumption of marijuana, I find the amount of weed I smoke correlates directly to the strength of the hallucinations. Half a gram is enough to get it started, with fully textured objects at 1g+. Most effective if you smoke a fatty right after the peak and continue like that every hour or so.

Now it has been speculated that metabolism to MDA could play a factor here. Usually hallucinations start after the peak and last until I accidentally fall asleep about 2-3 hours later. However only roughly 5-10% of the MDMA will become MDA, which at 200mg will be way below threshold for MDA. There might be synergy, I don't know, I never had MDA, but I'm doubtful of that theory. Amphetamine psychosis was suggested before, again I don't know, the hallucinations never lasted longer than the MDMA, and I've never observed any other (bad) side effects. One time there were some shadow people, I was hallucinating heavily that night and I had some doubts about what was real at that point, but it was late already and the shadow people were really faint, maybe placebo.

The last 6 years have been my own personal hell. I can't describe it in any way other than I feel like I'm losing my mind. I'm constantly angry, paranoid, depressed, and high strung for seemingly no reason other than the fact that life exists. I hate the person I am so much. 

My anxiety gets to the point that I can't breathe and my entire body is spazzed out, back arching and limbs seizing, with no ability to calm down enough to regain control of my body. I literally start to pass out if I get too angry or upset, but just the day to day anger and stress stops me from eating, sleeping, and doing pretty much anything else a normal human is supposed to do with ease. I can't have a conversation with anyone, I can't look people in the eyes without having mini heart attacks, everything is an attack on me, and I'm constantly scared of myself and what I might decide is a rational thing to do next. I have been a physical threat to myself in the past, and I would try absolutely anything to feel like I have control over my mind again. 

I have tried molly before, and it had positive effects on everything listed above for weeks to come, but stuff went back downhill after, and lately it's been escalating to a scary point. 

I need a huge slap in the face or this is never going to turn around. I feel like shrooms would shock my system big, and figure out what's at the root of all this. I know anxiety/depression/psychedelics don't mix, but I think there has to be a deep psychological root to all of this, and I honestly cannot think of how I could end up worse off. I would take extreme precautions to ensure my safety in the event of an episode during the trip, and only do it when I was in my best state.

My question (of sorts) is this. I have little to no experience with IV injection, so I want to make sure that my intentions won't damage me in any capacity. 

I plan on obtaining some sterile injection water and approximately 250mg of the fumerate salt of 4-AcO-DMT from a reliable and well established vendor.

I intend to use a 1cc/30g insulin syringe.

And I had a few questions for anyone who had tried it. I imagine it's not exactly a risky combination, so there wouldn't be much harm in experimentation, but it can't hurt to ask.

Been using it for ~1 year. Almost entirely orally - occasionally a bit on top of a cone before I go out for a big night. Probably on average around twice a month for that period. (sometimes 3-4 weekends a month, sometimes none, depends on what's going on). No more than a point a weekend ever. I've never used it during the week.

Now I'd had these symptoms before but never really thought about it. I've been out 3 out of the last 4 weekends - did a point + a pill each Saturday night. On this Monday night after work ~20.30 (can pinpoint the exact time since it came on very suddenly), I suddenly started to feel like I was getting a fever, bit nauseous, headache. Within about 30mins I was shivering like crazy - I took 2 ibuprofen, had a cone and went to bed. 

Woke up really dazed and confused, had to think to even remember what happened right before bed, kinda felt kindy achy and sick since. Nothing serious, just a background level. Was well enough to go to work.  Almost felt like the same this started happening about 2100 last night so I did the same thing again - 2 ibuprofen + a cone and went to bed. 

In hind-sight I've had this experience before, but just chalked it up to a brief virus from being run down without really thinking about it. Normally I'd do the same here... it's just something tickling in the back of my mind that this isn't quite what I think it is - and I've learnt to trust my instincts over the years.

So, now I'm wondering - is it possible that what I was experiencing was some form of meth withdrawal? I just don't feel like I'm actually 'normal sick' if you know what I mean. With the amount I've been doing is that even a possibility? Or am I just not looking after myself well enough heh.

Bought 200 mg, My friend took 2 trips where he could see visuals, walls melting, etc. But he still had frame of reference of reality.

My trips were eye balled measurements first smoked using a glass crack style vape but as a pipe, then using a beer can. (got 5 hits in total from the 200mgs 3 much smaller hits for my mates who were sceptical and my friend loaded around half split into 2 for me.)

My first trip, I was not really prepared for how harsh the smoke would be, I used a eagle base shake and vape with screen and ash (maybe it would have been better to vape using the actual glass instead of using as pipe?). I coughed myself into the trip (edit: forgot, coloured lines morphed for what felt like 3 seconds with my cough as I lay back into the couch, but those colourful visuals quickly vanished), I became, almost what I could describe as a womb, or more like trapped in a womb. I had died and there were people (no sure if people, I could never put faces to the things standing around me) asking me to come back. I could hear the cough ringing in my ears, I felt what I had done was a mistake. When I finally came out, I was so happy and I had actually enjoyed the experience, a lot more happened during the trip but I can't remember any of it.

I took a second maybe larger eyeballed hit about 3 hours later. First my hearing went, then my vision. There was only darkness, then nothing - I can't remember anything at all from this point. It's like I completely blacked out. My friends said I was sat there on the couch just like my first trip. This one I came out of with such a feeling of relief. The relief just enveloped me. I don't know what the relief was from as I can't remember the second trip only fade to black. Is memory loss on NN DMT normal? Did I dive in a bit hard?

Other substances used recently - MDMA (3 previous nights), cocaine (previous night) alcohol throughout (before and after tripping, this did not make me spontaneously want to take DMT, I had been planing to for a long time and I had the opportunity there and then, pity I had been drinking before hand)

I had taken some Xanax the night before for the first time to try it, just 1.5mg, and it just made me a little wobbly and calm. So the next night I was smoking weed with some friends and decided to pop some Xanax. I took 3mg this time, and it was a tad too much as I vomited later that night. Also I had this odd thing happen where I got really in my head and couldn't focus on the TV. There were these thoughts just racing through my brain, and I was constantly asking myself meaning-of-life type questions that can't truly be answered definitively. I didn't have a problem with it then, just had someone drive me home and puked and felt wonderful afterward.

Anyway, I didn't smoke weed or do anything for about a week, and then I went to smoke weed with my friend like we always do. Smoked a blunt with the two of us and a bowl from his bong. I started to get the same mind-racing sensation, but I just couldn't stop the questions from coming, and this time I didn't like it. I just wanted to chill, and I was having trouble coping with my mind just going on and on and on. I actually asked myself if I was turning schizophrenic or something and got kinda freaked out from it. I had this mindset stick with me all the next day too, despite not being high any more. 

I waited two weeks to calm down and then tried smoking again a couple nights ago, and was pretty much fine. I had a moment where I thought it was gonna start again, but I just turned on some Beatles and I was fine.

So my question is, is this indicative of how my potential LSD experience would go? I have never tried it before, nor done anything more than smoke weed and than Xanax. I keep thinking that it won't be the same because they're two different drugs that have different effects, but I'm wondering if anyone else has had a poor experience on weed, but been fine on LSD.

So I guess my question then becomes: If I take some acid or shrooms during the day (say, 4 o'clock) will I be able to re-up before/during the concert and save my peak?  Or am I more likely to have a small peak at like 7 or 8 and then again later on if I take more?  I am willing to see the art sober so long as I get the best experience during the concert.  



Also- I prefer shrooms overall, but which would be best for a concert?  Or what would be the best order to take them in, if I do end up taking both?

Please note that I am not here to judge. I'm asking out of curiosity. I have never had an addiction problem nor been in direct relations with anyone who has so I am just curious about a few things. I'm not writing a paper for school or anything, you're not going to be put on display as my project! Please do not take offense to my questions, I mean them with the utmost ignorance on the subject and am looking for answers so I can be educated!

I will give you some background on my ""drug use"". I'm basically a virgin so be nice! 
P.s. this part is slightly boring so if you just want to skip it the TL;DR is I have tried x twice and alcohol that's it.

~January 2008 drank a 6 pack of Smirnoff (green apple mmm) + 2 ecstasy pills. Unfortunately I was too drunk and in the hands of friends who introduced me to the x to know anything about them. What dosage or anything. (I don't know how you describe them? Percentage of whatever drug x contains?!? I told you I was a virgin at this. What did you expect?) I do vaguely remember something about white Louis Vuittons if that helps any?
Experience: With the alcohol alone I was drunk. (Im a lightweight yeah, yeah, yeah so what?) Within 10 minutes of finishing the last Smirnoff I took the first x pill. I was feeling pretty good by this point. I remember being forced to drink a lot of water and orange juice (which I was told would increase the roll) because alcohol makes me really dehydrated and as I'm sure you're aware combined with the x it was really bad. I'm guessing about 1-2 hours later is when I had the 2nd pill. At this point it was probably 4-5 am somewhere in there. I was half naked (top off) and in my friends living room with a guy I'd never met. (Can you say awks?!? i was freaking sweating like crazy!) We had very deep conversations and interestingly enough he later became my fiancé (although we have since broke it off). I just remember playing with glow sticks and listening to techno/trance music until about 8 or 9 am and then leaving to go home. I ended up falling asleep around 11. 
~March 2008 2 x pills. 
Experience: I tried x again with my ex fiancé (we weren't engaged yet lol) For some reason within about 2 hours he felt pretty sick. I personally didn't feel that bad and was hyped up on cleaning up my apt while listening to techno and him playing with glow sticks, sick as a dog, laying in my bed. I had to work the next day but it wasn't until about 2 pm so I figured I'd be ok. About 10 am I was done cleaning and started feeling really sick. Probably the fact of not drinking enough water and running around cleaning. Anyways needless to say I ended up calling in bc I was feeling like shit and my eyes were too dilated. 

As far as currently and since then, alcohol is the only ""drug"" I use. I'm not a heavy drinker and only drink occasionally. On average I drink 1-2 times per month. When I do drink, more often than not, I get tipsy not drunk. 

The only thing I know about any other drugs is what I see on tv shows. I try sticking to the more reality based such as Intervention and Addicted, as opposed to movies and things that are staged. I realize addiction doesn't affect everyone the same and, even though I don't know, I feel like  sometimes addiction is not accurately displayed on those shows.

Feel free to answer all, some or none of these questions. Up to you (; 

What are you addicted to?
What drugs have you tried?
How did it start?
At what point did it turn to addiction instead of recreational use?
Before you were addicted what was your favorite drug? (Assuming you've tried more than one.)
How long have you been addicted?
Have you ever hit rock bottom? 
What kinda of things are you/were you willing to do for your next high?
Have you tried rehab before?
Would you like to get help (again, if you've already tried)? 
If you'd like to get help why haven't you already? 
How does your addiction affect your every day life?

On a side note, what are your goals and aspirations in life?

Go figure.

So here we are, 2 and a half hours away from home at a small unit in the middle of nowhere with little to no one else around (a nice and quiet environment right?). We both dropped at 9PM, after some conversation about helping to keep the mood relaxed, then watched a movie and listened to some music. Soon after, we moved to somewhere less cold, being the bedroom, and that's where things took a nightmarish turn. After being adamant about how she was having a 'good trip', she then continuously switched between the two, 'best trip', 'worst trip' etc. and then suddenly screamed as loud as she could. I hugged her and reassured her, but she wasn't herself anymore - she started repeating broken bits of random sentences, mentioning a few peoples names, 'best, worst, best, worst' etc. and followed by the occasional scream. I'm thinking this may have been a thought loop that she was stuck in, but it continued (with changes to the random words she was repeating every now and then) for the entire trip. She began writhing and kicking, and I attempted to keep her restrained (and failed) and before long she was running around in the living room taking off all her clothes whilst still muttering strangeness. Some of her screaming became ""I HATE YOU I HATE YOU I HATE YOU"", which wasn't what I really wanted yelled at me when I'm fearing that I may have permanently fucked my girlfriends brain whilst fighting off my own trip. She kept becoming more violent (Not really aggressive, just fast movements) and I ended up holding her and restraining her to the floor with my legs and arms. After a little while, I attempted to relocate her to the bedroom again so we could lie somewhere nice and comfy, but before long she was kicking and screaming again, running into the shower fully clothed and coming back out, throwing things from bedside tables to the floor and pulling things off walls. I was **horrified**, above all else I just wanted her to be safe and okay and almost considered calling the police to help out. From where I live, this would have had HUUGE repercussions, so I tried to wait it out with her, keeping her restrained when she was flailing about, trying to talk to her but not getting much response. By now it's 5:30AM, and she's finally in the shower coming down off the trip, getting it together again and I haven't felt happier (not to mention weird shit was happening to the walls and shadows all around me, which was pretty awesome). 

Now that it's the day after, a lot of what she said is still ingrained in my head vividly (and terrifyingly), *yet she says she can't remember any of it?* Is it possible for someone to forget an entire trip? As for my fuckups, not having a tripsitter, being so far from home (which was a TERRIBLE idea, not having any help close by), not removing loose objects from around the place and forgetting that she's on anti-anxiety medication (have heard some reactions to lithium can cause a bad trip, but I'm not sure of the meds she's on exactly) have manifested into a terrible concoction that I can't seem to shake. Is there anything permanent that could become of all of this? was I okay to be pinning her down like that? Was it as simple as saying 'she had a bad trip' and everything will be okay soon? I feel fucking awful and am having a really hard time convincing myself things will be okay again...

**TL;DR: Girlfriend and I dropped acid, she flipped the fuck out and now I feel like I may have caused her/myself permanent damage.**

I have been smoking pot for about 2.5 years now, but not a lot until this year. Currently I smoke about once a day, 5 times a week. I also am a runner and I would consider myself extremely healthy (I ran sub 15:00 in the 5k last year).

Other background info: I took one capsule of MDMA powder 5 days previous to this event. I really enjoyed rolling but did not feel anything like what I felt yesterday. The only other drugs I use are caffeine (I drink 2 cups of coffee every morning) and alcohol (I drink maybe once every few months). 

Now to the story of yesterday:

It was a typical Thursday. Some friends and I were sitting together enjoying a smoke sesh. I had had an ordinary amount of weed. I took 2 lung fulls from a bubbler and 2 pretty big bong rips. I felt pretty toasted but nothing I couldn't handle. After a while of talking about the universe, my friend loaded up the bubbler for a second go-around. 

After taking a good lung full from the bubbler and passing it to the next toker in line, I felt my heart race increase. This is nothing out of the ordinary for me, as I usually notice an increased heart rate from weed, as I know it is a side effect. But after about 30 seconds, I noticed that my heart rate and the stroke volume/intensity of the heart was getting faster and stronger. 

As the intensity seemed to grow, I tried to take long/deep breaths and drank some water to try to slow my heart down. After a couple of minutes of the same intensity, I laid down on the floor. I closed my eyes, took deep slow breaths, and drank some more water. Nothing seemed to help. My friend brought me up some pasta to see if that would help, but after eating a few bites, my heart still pumped with incredible intensity.

After about 20 minutes since the rapid/intense heart rate started, both my arms and my legs started to get really tingly. When my arms started to go numb, I knew it was time to go to the hospital. My non-smoker roommate drove me to the hospital. 

When in the ER, my pulse was 120 or so (My resting rate is in the mid-30's since I am a runner). I told the doctor that it was caused by marijuana (he said legally he could not leak this information outside of the hospital). After taking lots of blood, the doctor said nothing else was in my system (I was wondering if these effects were caused from the MDMA 5 days before). My EKG showed a small change or something which was a concern, as well as a small heart murmur.

After these tests, I was moved to the hospital where I would spend the night. My heart raced for a good 5 hours. At the most intense points, I felt my heart almost expand from the amount of blood it was pumping. I thought my heart was going to burst. 

After spending the night in the hospital and receiving tests this morning, the doctor cleared me to go as nothing was really wrong with me.

Please tell me what exactly happened to me. I am worried about this happening to me again. This was a terrifying experience as I thought I was having a heart attack. Was it purely from the marijuana? Could any of the effects have been caused by the MDMA? 

I plan on taking at least a week off from smoking. I was planning on stopping smoking after 4/20 anyway for job reasons. If I do smoke in a week, it will be very light. Would a vaporizer help?

Lastly, my 2 friends and I were planning on taking mushrooms on 4/20. Now I am concerned if I should take them at all or not. Right now I am considering taking 1 g at first and maybe 1 more gram after an hour. 

Please give me your advice on what I should do and what you think happened to me.
Thanks!

TL;DR: My heart went out of control after smoking pot. Went to the ER, thinking I was having a heart attack. Please tell me what happened/what I should do to prevent this from happening in the future.

- MDMA (loved it, except for inability to ejaculate, and the hangover the next day)

- Shrooms (did not like it, maybe i just don't like shrooms because of the stomach ache)

- Alcohol (hate it and dont like alcohol in general)


I is looking for a new drug to have sex on.
Through my research I have found the following as possible choices for me to try:

- Cocaine (worried about health affects and harsh comedown)

- Speed (worried about the same things as cocaine)

- GHB (hard to get)

- 2C-B (hard to get)

- 2C-E (hard to get)

- Methylone (hard to get)



I have researched these drugs and do not want to do them

- Meth (health risks, and i dont have 9hrs for sex, i would like it to be 3h max)

- Mephedrone (health risks)

- LSD (trip is too long and i feel it could go badly the first time without an experienced sitter)

Last time I took half the tab first.and a bit less than an hour later the rest. But I still should've gotten the full dose, right?

I have pure tan MDMA. I would like to dose about 200mg

What is the best 2c to get some cool visuals but still know what is going on and maybe even add a bit more excitement/energy?

EDIT: I have googled,searched reddit and erowid with nothing this specific. Trip reports would be great!

Second Edit: Thank you guys for the replies. Especially kbrc. 

I do not like shrooms too much because of the weird body feeling and general confusion. Like: ""what is this thing in my hand? (it was a cigg), ""why am I sliding down this non-existent hill?""

Also I have yet to try LSD, I am scared it will be just like my bad shroom trip, trying to avoid introspection, looking for more of just visuals, that's why I am keen on mixing with MDMA because it puts me in such a great lovey mood.

I LOVE MDMA because of the awesome body feeling sexiness, and euphoria. I want something that can add to it visually. I would rather avoid introspection as this is how it seems I have bad trips. (my biggest fear is repeating my bad shroom trip as I hated EVERYTHING. ""why did I put these drugs in my body, I want to end it. everything has to stop right now"" Repeat that about a thousand times for 4 hours.

However, in addition to that, I do want to hear what you guys think.

Last night I was over at my friend's house hanging out doing the New Years thing, where I drank 1 Mike's Hard Lemonade. I had been sober for a day before the alcohol, however, the two days before that had been somewhat heavy on indulgences: 2 back-to-back doses of DXM the day-night before, 750 mg each, and the night before that involved 2 grams of mushrooms and around 350 mg MDMA. (this is not my normal level of partying, my birthday and New Years just happen to fall next to each other).

Anyway, so I got up to walk home from my friend's house, which is only 2 houses down from mine, and I notice that I'm a little more disoriented than I should be for one drink. Well, I thought, it's probably just the DXM hangover, and I don't worry too much about it. As I walk back, my walking becomes more and more labored, and I notice that it feels like the quintessential ""robo"" walk rather than a drunken ramble. I also notice that my hearing starts going fuzzy, it feels like my ears are stuffed with cotton balls and all could hear was an intense buzzing and the sound of my heart. It felt like my heart was struggling to keep working, it was like my whole chest was compressing in and out with every beat, and my ribcage was rattling and numb. By the time I made it to my room it was completely overwhelming and I collapsed on my bed. I told my significant other, who I  woke up by falling on, that I thought something was medically wrong with me. They began freaking out and asking if they should call an ambulance, but by this point I was unable to respond. I had lost all sense of balance, and I felt like I couldn't tell which way was up. I would try to push myself into a sitting position, but I would push myself too far in a given direction and fall back over onto the bed. My legs were shaking out of my control and I was crying, my SO was holding me on the bed to stop me falling off from my spazzing legs. After a few minutes it calmed down enough that I could sit up and communicate what had happened to my SO so they could Google possible causes/methods of actions. Sitting up seemed to bring it back to some degree however, and the tight numbness returned to my chest until I lay back down.

I haven't been able to find any relevant information on the internet, and it will be a little while before I can get an appointment with my doctor. I'm trying to stay calm, but it was an overwhelmingly frightening experience. The overwhelming numbness and rattling in my chest genuinely made me think I was going to die, and the fear in my partner's voice as they held me down when I was spazzing and telling me they loved me was terrifying. If you have any knowledge or experience on what may have caused this, I'd highly appreciate it. Obviously my first thought is that it is some sort of drug interaction from my partying the preceding days, but I thought these things would be more documented if they were common.

Chilling, listening to some music, he's going on about some philosophical bullshit, which I thought at the time was normal and alright. Next thing I know he just starts peeing in the middle of my room. Not the way drunk people do, when they can't get to the restroom in time. Just sat there and had a whizz. I asked him if he could go to the restroom, he said 'I don't have to'.

We were well after peak already, slowly coming down, so I thought it was safe to go send him shower and change, but while I was cleaning up his piss he undressed outside and marched around in front of my neighbours' doors.

When he wasn't coming back in I freaked out a little, didn't really know what to do. It's -5°C outside (below freezing), he was naked with no money/phone/keys, I couldn't just leave him there, but I was afraid for my own safety as well. I had absolutely no idea how to deal with him myself, so I called the cops...

They arrested him, he didn't really react to being spoken to. (I mean, I took the exact same stuff he took, including food - we should've been on the exact same level, but he was completely out there, and I was fairly coherent). They noted my name and that sort of stuff and that I was ""apparently under the influence of drugs"". I could really hardly say no at that point, they would've taken me in and found out anyway, so I nodded it off and said I don't want to make any further statements without my lawyer.

So now he's with the police, god knows what he'll tell them. I told him not to say anything and wait for his lawyer, but I have no idea if he actually realized that.

I have a friend with whom I've been smoking for a couple of weeks. She's always been very timid about smoking. When we'd hit a bong, she'd make someone else pull the smoke into the bong, then breathe in really slowly. Generally, whoever she passed it to would get 80% of the smoke in the bong. 

Well, she got to saying things like, ""I'm immune [to weed],"" because her father smoked in their house when she was younger and she'd built up a tolerance or something. I knew it was bullshit, so I told her that the only thing keeping her from successfully getting high was her own unwillingness to try it. After multiple attempts, she finally inhaled enough smoke that she said she felt something. But then she started saying it was ""the worst feeling of [her] life"" and it was like when she was ""the sickest [she's] ever been."" 

Well, I figure it could be a number of things, like that our other friend is a spaz when he's high, and perhaps he was making her anxious, or that she just got paranoid. But it's occurred to me that maybe she just doesn't like it. I love it though, so I have to wonder why someone might not like to smoke. 

So, askdrugs, if any of you out there don't like to smoke weed, could you tell me why? I'm genuinely curious. It relaxes me and makes me feel so much better.

I have done +15 different ""drugs"" 
from MDPV to Flephedrone to DPMP
and +25 psychedelics 
from Ayahuasca to Allylescaline to AMT

I tend to prefer psychedelics because they have much cooler peripheral effects along with the euphoria (which I don't get) compared to drugs.

Example: 
GHB make me slightly less inhibited, make me wobbly and not see straight and slightly sedated. but no ""good feeling"" or euphoria to speak of.
LSD produces visuals, shift in patterns of thought, etc. No mood lift or euphoria to speak of.
MDMA narrows my perception, makes me think fast and gives me energy but in fact causes anxiety and decreased sociability.

I am prone to anxiety though the lack of euphoria tends to manifest not in anxious feelings that I am so familiar with but rather neutrality or even boredom. (as far as I can tell)
Smoking weed is something that it very significantly different for possible the same reason. 
If I smoked 1 puff off a joint then I get paranoia in the I-feel-like-I-am-dying sense. 

I have experimented extensively with 2c-e, MDPV, GHB and MDMA/MDMA analogues and Cathinones in every dose, timing, after 1 day to 3+ month break and in every way I could think of until I simply gave up.

The curiousity is still high about the reason though the drive to experiment has ended mostly due to lack of anything left to try.

I just felt like everything was an ordeal and I would go over a million what ifs in my mind. Everything seemed so dreary. I was really nervous, anxious, and found it hard to joke (even though years ago I was the funny outgoing one in my group of friends). I used pot both on and off, regulated and unregulated, but everything seemed to make me feel anxious and negative in the long run.

So, I told my GP that I've been very unmotivated and nervous/anxious feeling, and he prescribed me Cipralex. For years I thought I would never take any pills to alter my mood. But I haven't felt normal in a very long time, and I had to do something.

I am truly afraid that it will make me unmotivated, or lazy, or make me care less about my work. The loss of libido is a whole other concern.

But the worst part is, even though they weren't supposed to be effective for at least a few weeks, I've found it helped me nearly instantly... I'm not sure I want them to ""even me out"" more than they already have. I am on my third day and there is a noticeable difference. Maybe antidepressants were the answer all along?

I will mention that in the months prior to starting anti depressants, I had already changed my diet and that did make me feel drastically better in a lot of ways. I realized when I don't eat gluten and carbs, my stomach doesn't feel sick anymore. And I finally feel like I can actually focus on a task! It has motivated me to go back to school... but this dreary anxious haze was still hanging over me.

Previously, I had exercised on and off but it never cheered me up too much on a long term basis. I take vitamins, ride my bike every day. And still... dark clouds...

I'm still kind of thinking of going off the meds and starting an **intense** daily exercise routine instead, but I'm not sure if I should stay on the meds long enough to get me motivated and get going to the gym.

Another friend suggested MDMA in controlled amounts instead of ADs. When I have done it in the past it has certainly made me feel feelings that i hadn't experienced since I was young and careless teen, so I do see it as somewhat therapeutic.

I want to talk to a psychologist instead of a GP badly, as maybe CBT is enough for me, but simply cannot afford one in any way.

I feel like I'm running out of options, but I don't wanna mess up my brain. Help?

**TL;DR I tried many non-medical things to fix my obsessing and my dreariness. Got Cipralex, it works 3 days in... now I'm worried because I actually feel like staying with it for a while.**

I've asked a few of my friends and no one can really give me a clear answer, more along the lines of ""acid is different for everybody, man.""

[side note: shrooms work on me, so its not specifically hallucinogenic drugs]

Anyways, over the course of my drug use I have taken 6 total hits of acid: twice with single hits, twice with two hits.
Never once have I really ""tripped.""  Maybe I don't really understand how acid works.. or what to expect; but I thought it would be similar to shrooms, but so far it hasnt held a candle to it.. which honestly surprised me:

My first time (1 hit), my group (3 of us) didnt really feel much.. kinda got my arm to turn purple but not really much else other than some time distortion.  The next time (2 hits) which was actually that night (and turned out to be a pretty bad decision), my two friends tripped face!!  (Like stupid amounts. my friend who I had tripped shrooms with said it was like one of our intense trips but x10) But for me, if i stared at something long enough it kinda morphed.. or if i stared/concentrated on the ground some really small ""flowers"" would grow and die, but this was about the extent of the visuals.  My friends felt the melt, they eventually got to a point where they could hardly verbalize.. but my mental state never really varied.
Recently  i tried to candy flip (1 hit acid, 2 mollie)..completely failed. Got a pretty good roll, but nothing visually or acid-y.  The next time (2 hits) was with a bigger group, some tripped really hard, the ppl i was more with didnt trip as hard but they still tripped (visual hallucinations, etc.).  and for me, i got a pretty cool body high and it made me super giggly (kinda like weed when you're a newbie).  Now these last 3 hits had been at a music festival in the desert, so I was thinking the heat may have gotten to it... but still, the same conditions and it worked for my friends:  this is typically the case.

So, my question I guess is: whats up with me?  
I never heard of natural acid tolerance, but is that a thing? (someone told me if my dad did acid around when i was conceived it could give me a high tolerance, as this is a possibility, is that true or just some shit?)

*P.S. This is leading me to want to try taking more hits at once, however I'm afraid that maybe one of those times it'll just start working and I'll trip uncomfortable amounts of face.. if you know what i mean.*

**TL;DR- taken total 6 hits [4 different times] of acid, never tripped face when friends in same conditions did.  Do I have an ""acid tolerance""/is that a thing?**

So I'm driving a long distance to a festival next weekend with 3 friends and I'll be carrying a lot of drugs in the car (LSD, 10gs of Molly, and an O of Marijuana). Everyone in the car knows about this, since it's all our stuff. Mailing the drugs is not an option, we have to drive down with it.

These are the precautions I'm taking. I'll be placing everything in a safe in the trunk underneath some suitcases. I will not be smoking in the car or do anything illegal to bring any attention to the car or to give any probable cause to search the car. I will be sober the entire ride and so will everyone else in the car.

I know my rights, if they ask to search the car with no probable cause I will politely say NO. If they decide to arrest/detain me for any reason I will not answer any questions other than identifying myself and ask for a lawyer. Is a safe probable cause to search the car (I don't think so right?)

However, if they somehow have probable cause and decide to search my car, are they also allowed to search my safe? Will I be obliged to open the safe without them having a warrant? Can I just outright refuse to open the safe? If they do find all the drugs, who ultimately is responsible? Is everyone in the car responsible? Or does someone have to step up and take all the heat?

Any tips/advice to keep my friends and I from going to jail for a long time guys?

So i'm wondering, How effective would atenolol be in the treatment of anxiety?  What is its safety profile/addiction potential, especially in comparison with more popular anti-anxiety treatments (benzo's)?  Also, would it be a take-as-needed treatment like xanax/ativan or more of a once-a-day type deal?

If its the latter I think it could potentially be very useful for me, as i have pretty-very strong anxiety, but don't really want to start taking a benzo, as I would probably end up needing it too often and would develop a dependence.  An ssri could help, i was on them for a bit, but didn't like and don't think i needed the antidepressant side of it, only the anti-anxiety; they (prozac-&gt;paxil) had too many other effects for me to keep taking.

Beta blockers sound like they may be a helpful alternative, I may bring it up with my doctor eventually if it sounds good.

I had very bad palpitations, hallucinations, ""pins and needles"" feeling in my hands and arms, shortness of breath, weird feelings, etc.  I get panic attacks every now and again, so I didn't want to make a big deal out of it and go to the hospital because these are the same symptoms I get with anxiety, except blown up with amphetamines.  Also, the kid I took them with took more than I had, and he was fine (leading me to believe it was anxiety on my end).

Anyway, it's been 22 hours since my last pill.  I slept (waking up every 20-30 minutes) for about 8 hours and just woke up.  I feel way better than before, but still not 100%.  Is there a timetable for when I should start feeling completely normal again?

I've been looking for it for awhile, I asked a lot of friends if they knew anyone where i could get a decent quantity.

Took a few days to meet up, he kept saying his dude (lets call him Rick) was going to get it later than he thought. Finally last Thursday I meet Dre and give him the money, he says he thinks he remembers me from HS, we have a decent amount of mutual friends. Dre says he needs to drive 45 min to Ricks place to get it, he'd call me later that day to come get it.
 So a few hours later I go to Dre's house, I meet his mom, go in to his room and he hands me to little eye droppers. Says that one drop is one hit. I thank him, he said I could call him anytime i want more. He seemed like a really cool guy and iI was really happy on how this deal went. 
Two days later I try a drop on a sweet tart, i was disappointed to feel practically nothing.  I thought i had that ""lucy feeling"" but i later found out it was just a placebo effect. I called Dre up the next day and said wtf, he said that he took a drop too and was not happy and was trying to get back to Rick. Heard nothing back from him, three days later I find we are no longer friends on facebook (he still hasn't re-added me) I try the lucy again but 4 drops directly on the mouth. Nothing. 
So for the past three days I have been calling Dre and he keeps sound convincing that he is looking for Rick and Rick won't answer nor can he find him. I'm beginning to become skeptical and that he may just be good at conning people, but I'm still unsure of what I should do.

I didn't count it as tripping. I don't know if my body rejects weird drugs, but the first time I got high was probably after 5 times of trying it, and these tries included blunts.

Second time I took some, I ordered some from SR called albino penis envy. Took an 8th of those. My friend was doing NBOMe, and we went hiking some place I've never been to which had about 8 waterfalls. We ran into some people there, too.

So as soon as we started walking down, which may have been like 15 minutes in or something, I started feeling nauseous, but I wanted to suppress it because I heard that throwing up can kill the effect, and after having a disappointing ""first"" time, I didn't want it to happen again. Idk how far into it I was by then, but I suddenly started having visuals. Things were vibrating in a certain kind of way, and sort of growing at the same time. I felt like I could see air, too. 

That was fine, but then I started coming up HARD. I started puking a few times, wayyy more than I puked my first time. I felt like I started getting into a loop in my head. One vivid thought was ""is this what it feels like to have some type of mental disorder? I didn't feel like myself at all, and I was sort of conscious about it, you could say (it's really hard for me to explain it)? Then I started getting amnesia, I kept asking my friend how we got where we were (I drove us there), I completely forgot what day it was. I kept asking her the name of the place, although I already knew it. I wondered where my other friends were, and stuff. It was hard for me to accept that I didn't smoke the shrooms, nor drank it - since I'm usually accustomed to weed smoking and binge drinking. Concepts were very hard to grasp. The one thing that helped me wake up a little was that my friend said that it's all in my head because it's a PSYCH drug. Before that I had asked her if I was being obnoxious, and she said yes, which also helped me wake up a little, because I sort of have a crush on her. I remember trying to quit (as if I could) and trying to go back home, but we HAD to stay there for the whole 5 hours of the trip. At some point my hearing was sort of fading - kind of like being underwater, and it was harder to utter words.

I had looked at her at some point and commented how she had four eyes and she hid her face and told me not to look at her (she is way more experienced than I am). 

After we started walking again, I felt a lot better. I actually felt on top of the world, but what came before really clouded it. I even shared with my friends that I was having one of the most amazing experiences ever - which I was. I walked across a log to get to the opposite side of a stream. We climbed the side of a waterfall which was quite risky but exhilirating. We had some nice talks about how the earth outlives us, and it was mind-blowing that I was standing in a place that was in a very similar state as it was 20+ years ago. A good trip at the end. 

So here's the thing. In &lt; a month I want to try them again, but this time has to be by myself because I'm on summer vacation and not at school with other drug enthusiastic friends. I was thinking about going to Central Park in NYC. I don't know if it'll be too public. I think I'd be okay with just sitting there, listening to music on my headphones. Or should I wait till I'm back at school. Don't know if I'll get penis envy again, or try something new, but in the same dosage.

And other persons' perspectives. Rehab, unless it really reaches that point, is not an option because I have a tech job and am high functioning, though have been on a steady and now what I feel is precipitating cognitive decline. I feel I have multiple addictions at once though I don't know on which drug my withdrawal symptoms are most prescient (maybe all three).

* I'm 24 in tech.

* **Amphetamines** I started amphetamine usage at 19 years old. Worked my way up to 70mg of Vyvanse a day by age 20. Kept that up until 21 when I worked on a startup and managed a wannabe hip-hop artist. Upped that to 100mg. By the time I landed my first tech job in the Valley, I was on 140-150mg on weekdays with weekend breaks.

* **Benzos** Despite extensive preparation and meditative practice, a less-than-perfect violin performance due to minor muscle spasms frustrated me to the point that I asked my psychiatrist for a Klonopin prescription. 30 pills, 0.5mg, only to be taken on weekdays, weekend breaks. I eventually upped the dosage to 1mg on weekdays to take the edge off of the 140-150mg of Vyvanse. Currently I receive 45 0.5mg pills a month.

* **Alcohol** I hadn't started drinking until age 21. And at that point I'd only drank on weekends with friends. By 22 after starting my job this had eventually spiraled into daily drinking--casual, unhealthy but tempered. By 23, along with my morning Vyvanse and benzo usage, I'd party and drink heavily in the evening so I could eventually sleep. I'd regularly get 5-6 hours sleep a night, but didn't care because I had the Vyvanse and still had sharp cognitive function.

Flash forward to 24, and after having survived a heart attack, brushing past death a few other times, and softly hearing the sirens of impending demise, I decided - although *still* swept up in the romanticism of it all - to scale back my usage and eventually quit. It was at this point the potential cognitive consequences of my actions came to the forefront.

My worst withdrawal symptom is generalized anxiety with no traceable cause. This is most debilitating as it creates depersonalization, makes it difficult for me to truly connect with others, and makes me lose confidence in my decision-making, whereas before I had total confidence. These may be most likely traced to the benzos and alcohol, as Vyvanse withdrawal just makes me lethargic.

**Plan**

* Initially, I've started with cutting my benzo usage. Considering there's a 40% chance of addiction, I tried my hand at dosing down from 1mg to 0.5mg, then to 0. Two days later I had a debilitating generalized anxiety that although manageable, would make me appear aloof and irritable at work, as well as make it difficult to focus.

* I've instead started with cutting down my alcohol usage. 2 to at most 4 times a week instead of 6-7, eventually down to weekends only. I use an indica/sativa blend to help with sleeping and to curb how much I drink.

* I'll next dose-down my benzo usage: .75, then .5, until eventually we reach 0. Simultaneously I'll scale down my amphetamine usage to 100mg and test how I perform. Ideally I want to kick amphetamine usage entirely, as overtime on this drug I increasingly lose my sense of agency.

I have no regrets and I've had fun, amazing, if dangerous experiences. The worst punishment to me is not the damage I've done to my body, but to my mind. I feel I can't incisively see the 'big picture' as I used to, with clarity, confidence, that keen perception. I feel I've lost my sense of agency and wonder if my behavior, decisions, actions come from myself, my drugs, my withdrawal.

None of my experiences have been positive. The first time is pretty irrelevant; I was drunk, I took less than one hit, and I didn't notice anything other than maybe some slight changes in my perception.

The second time was the absolute worst experience of my life. I was moderately drunk and took three big hits from a bowl in the back of some dude's car. I was with one close friend that I trusted, but I didn't know anyone else there. Immediately after taking the third hit, everything changed. I started seeing everything in either black and white or bright flashing colors. I felt like I was floating a bit, my mouth tasted like salt and vinegar chips, I could feel my pulse in weird places. At first it was pretty chill, but it quickly took a turn for the worse. I got caught in a time loop, everything kept happening over and over and I knew what people were going to say before they said it (I'm guessing this has something to do with my brain not being able to  process short term memories very well). I ended up falling into a puddle and hitting my head, and I went through a weird derealization/depersonalization. The outside world was nonexistent. At first, I knew that I had smoked weed and thought that I was in a coma. All I could see was pitch black. I saw obscure visions of the first house I lived in (I was only 2 when we moved from there) and as things kept getting hazier, I felt like my life was the sum of my flaws and bad decision. It got crazier from there. I felt like I was swallowed by the blacktop I was laying on, and I was entirely surrounded. Everything was dark. I started to feel less and less like a human. This continued to the point where I felt like I was just one molecule in the middle of a bunch of dark matter. All I could feel was pain, and I thought that the only reason I existed was to feel pain; like the whole universe was empty except for this one living particle that just hurt all the time. I'm not sure how long I was on the ground, but I wasn't responding to anyone that whole time. They eventually pulled me up from the ground and i was instantly flung back into reality. I told my friend that ""she'd never believe the crazy journey I just took."" They sat me down and started to call some of my friends to come pick me up. The next day, I felt very out of it. I was too afraid to drive, and I still felt hazy. I was watching a movie and thought everything was glitchy, but I think I was still pretty messed up. I didn't feel completely normal until the night after that ( about 48 hours after smoking).

I decided to try again on 4/20. I hadn't drank anything, and I was with the same friend as before. We were at her house, sitting on the back patio. I had brought another friend, and she had a handful of people over as well. I knew everyone there to some degree. They bought some lower quality weed so I wouldn't get freaked out of my mind. I took a few hits and didn't feel anything for awhile, so I took another and waited. Pretty soon, I was spacey, caught in a time loop again, but I made myself relax. I knew that I'd come out of it fine. I pulled out my phone to check the time. Turns out, this helped me a lot. I kept glancing at my phone to remind myself that time was moving forward. I got a little freaked out and started daydreaming, starting to get into grotesque derealization territory again, but my friend noticed and comfortingly told me to snap out of it. She said that I needed to stay busy so that I wouldn't get lost in my mind. I tried to keep a conversation going and ended up getting out my guitar. I was so baked that I couldn't play half of the songs I wanted to (most of which I had written and played countless times before). My memory was shot and i felt like a classic stoner from Bill and Ted or something. I actually did have fun that day; we listened to some records and watched Family Guy. They also grilled burgers, which were amazing. But I still had an uneasy feeling the whole time and I just wanted it to go away.

I swore I wouldn't smoke again after that, as I didn't enjoy it, for the most part. But then my best friend, who I hadn't smoked with before, wanted to grab some weed. His girlfriend was out of town and he wanted to enjoy a smoke before he started his new job, which he'll have to take drug tests. I called a guy that I knew could get us some; we went and bought two pre-rolled joints of mids. I'm not kidding you, I took ONE hit from the joint and got fairly baked. It was mostly just a weird head feeling, but I also had an uncomfortable pulse in my throat, which would move around to other areas from time to time. I was fairly active the whole time I was high, moving stuff from my dorm to my car, packing, cleaning. I didn't freak myself out too much except for when I had to interact with other people: very strong deja vu again. I noticed that when I was by myself, this wasn't a problem. Receiving texts didn't freak me out, either. 

This was Saturday (4 days ago) and I'm still feeling a little weird. I'm functioning perfectly fine, but every once in awhile, when someone says something, it feels like I've already heard them say that. I had an extremely long week last week, so I feel like that has an effect on why it's been harder to recover this time, and I'm also probably freaking myself out more than I should. I've noticed a higher heart rate fairly often the last few days, too. But my main question is do any of you have recommendations to recover?

A description in one report describe spiders and it mentioned that some people say they are dots.  I then eventually made the connection that all the spiders and insects that a lot of people see were actually the same thing as my shadow people.

Every time you take a drug, especially ones that make you think, you get a deeper appreciation, a wellness feeling too? sometimes you might feel like you're dying if you've taken too big a dose..

I'm asking whether the drugs don't do anything but activate the parts of the subconcious that prepare you for death. Think about the emotional outcomes of taking a drug versus what people feel on the edge of death.

Relief, anxiety, regret, happiness, sadness. All these emotions are magnified as your brain slows down on whatever drug you've taken. Memory depreciates and you may hallucinate. When you die, DMT floods your brain. 

I know this is not a solid theory, as it's purely anecdotal, but is it possible that all drug takers do whenever they snort, bomb, smoke and vaporise is activate the parts of the brain that will also prepare them for death? Bringing them happiness and reward during their life instead of at the end of it?

I also smoked cannabis everyday for two years during this time. After last year of college I felt as if I had the tools to go off the meds, and I had also become sketched out by them and wanted to be medication free. The doctor said to stop the Welbutrin and taper off the Zoloft during the summer, and so I did. By the end of summer I was off all meds.

Around this time I began to feel depersonilized and experience derealization. It was very scary, because I thought i was going crazy. It felt like I was perceiving everything that was happening yet processing nothing. I was overwhelmed and struggled to do tasks that required me to pay attention. When I started back at school I felt as it it were impossible for me to learn. I felt like there was a literal blockade preventing me from understanding the information. I was afraid I would fail, so I went back on both medications at the instruction of my doctor. Started taking 100mg Welbutrin and 50mg Zoloft. (it's been a few months and now I take 150mg Welbutrin and 100mg Zoloft)

A few days after I started taking the meds again I was at a party. I had been drinking and smoking and thinking nothing of it until I began to feel very weird. I felt lots of pressure in my head and felt like I was getting electrical shocks. My heart rate was raised and I was sweating and felt sick. Very scary and i feared I was dying. After that I had a headache constantly everyday, and felt like my ears hurt/needed to pop. The doctor said that it seemed as if I had TMJ and jaw clenching, and since I started wearing a mouth guard at night the headaches stopped.

However, whenever i smoke cannabis now I feel weird. If I don't smoke alot I am fine, just feel a bit anxious but it's still enjoyable. But if I smoke more than a small amount I will have what I believe is a panic attack. I feel very out of it, disconnected and anxious. Physically I feel a tightness in my chest but the most scary part is I begin shaking. It feels like I have Parkinson's disease, I am uncontrollably shaking and physically cannot stop it. This makes me worry that I am going to have a seizure. I definitely feel like my muscles are contracting or something, my whole body just feels like it's freaking out. My breathing is very forced and all around it feels like I am dying. The worse of the symptoms last for an hour, but after that I start to feel better and after two or three hours I feel fine (better than usual since I am relieved it is over).

I am wondering if this is a panic attack or something else. I worry that it is a precursor to a seizure or if I am getting Serotonin Syndrome ! I am going to see a new doctor soon who I plan on discussing this with in full detail, but I really need to hear what others have to say because alot of doctors are not knowledgeable about this at all. Are there any tests I can get done to see if what i am experiencing is a panic attack, seizure, Serotonin Syndrome, or in any way dangerous? Please help and thank you for reading.

TL;DR On Welbutrin 150mg and Zoloft 100mg. If I smoke more than a few small hits I will have a bad reaction and feel extremely anxious, feel like I am dying, heart rates goes up, I begin to physically shake uncontrollably, and it feels like it's hard to breathe. Because I am on meds I worry that this is the precursor to a seizure or if I am getting Serotonin Syndrome. Please help

Some of my friends kinda thought their tongues felt a little numb(which would mean one of the NBOMe's, right?) but I didn't experience this, although it left a strong, bad taste on my tongue for a while.  I took it at 7:30pm and started feeling it after about 20 minutes, when it started coming on hard and fast.  

It was really edgy, anxious, and tense, and somewhat exciting.  After about 40 minutes, objects started growing/shrinking and other weird depth perception shit, followed by melting/warping of walls and ceilings and what not.  After about an hour, I was full on tripping.  I was surprisingly lucid for what I was experiencing, despite it being a pretty powerful trip.  All 4 friends (who've tripped multiple times before, on shrooms though not acid or whatever it was) said it was pretty damn strong, but they also felt relatively lucid.  It was amazing, but at the same time, I got sick of the tension and anxiety (which detracted from the visuals) after a while.  The people I was tripping with also experienced this, me and one other feeling almost physical tension inside our chest, and around the back of our necks, another friend said he was grinding his teeth most of the time.  Around 2AM I began coming down, ended up smoking a shitload of weed, falling asleep around 4:30AM, still kinda tripping.  It was my first time tripping, but the others had all tripped (shrooms).  Gave one to another friend later, he also experienced the tension, and anxiousness and unpleasant body load.  Although I experienced the tension and what not of the hard come-up for most of the trip, two of the 3 other trippers said after a while they felt comfortable and chill and had the best night ever.

My second time doing it, 2 nights later (which was fucking stupid), I also chilled out and felt no physical discomfort for a while after calming down after a mini panic attack type thing (heart pounding, feeling crazy, going back and forth between hot/sweaty to freezing, breathing heavily), having the best experience of my life, where I felt waves of euphoria and had intense visuals for about two hours until it quickly spiraled into a terrible terrible trip resulting in the most horrible experience of my entire life, leaving me with a depression and despair that is really fucking hard to shake, but its going away, but that's another story.  I was steadily smoking marijuana and hash throughout both trips which sort of helped with the edginess, and made for a nice come-down.  Let me know if I've left out any helpful information   

**TL;DR** Bitter, Metallic taste.  Did not swallow right away. Fast and tense come-up.  Lots of anxiety and energy.

However, I fear that I'll be taking these drugs expecting some type of magic and that I won't be able to get the desired effect.

I think that my ego is stopping me from really going through with things. I have slight social anxiety, in that I'm *great* in groups but when it comes to one-on-one I can't function as well at all. I have trouble approaching girls on the dance floor and haven't yet had sex. (I'm a straight male. Might as well clarify.)

I'm not unattractive or an asshole, so I think that most of these blocks and fear of rejection comes from myself mentally. I have absolutely no reason to be nervous about these things, but I am anyway.

As well I'm a little lost and lack motivation in school, unsure where I want to go with my degree and what I really want to do after I graduate. I really just need some clarity.

(EDIT: Not depressed. I go to a top university. Never had a problem with girls finding me undesirable. Doing well in school, even though it's getting pretty boring and repetitive.)

__________

So as far as experience with other drugs, it's limited:

* **Alcohol**: 1-2 times per week. Don't usually blackout or anything.
* **Caffeine**: 5-8 times per week. Usually four cups of coffee and a few energy drinks.
* **Weed**: only a handful of times when my friends offer it. I let them drink my alcohol in exchange to even out the sharing.
* **MDMA**: 4 times. each time 125mg parachuted with about 50mg booster later. I'm tall and athletically built, but that much always does the trick.
* **Nitrous Oxide**: Probably about 100 whippets total, but pretty spread out.

I find cigarettes produce a fairly intense and mostly pleasant rush. After the rush, I notice stimulant and mood elevating effects for 10 minutes or so. Is this usual for those without nicotine tolerance?

Today tried some nicotine gum with 2 mg per piece. I started off with 2 pieces, thinking I would feel a strong effect. I felt some stimulation, but it wasn't very strong, and I also drank some tea before. I wasn't satisfied, so I ended up chewing 10 pieces (20 mg total) over less than 3 hours. 

I definitely felt some effects, but it wasn't an exceptional amount of stimulation. I felt some stomach discomfort which sometimes became borderline nausea, and I felt restless. It wasn't mood elevating, and I felt irritable.

Why did it suck so much? I know people chew tobacco, so I was expecting something good even with gum. Is nicotine much nicer when smoked because of rapid absorption? It's my understanding that due to additives, smoking cigarettes is like freebasing nicotine.

I also got a familiar feeling in my mouth and especially the back of my throat. It's a harsh, prickly and bitter feeling that I remember from cigarettes.

I have not rolled in about 3 months. I want my best roll to be on the mdma, as I am taking that with my girlfriend and would like for us to be on the same level (she has no tolerance and hasn't rolled in over a year now). should I take the mdma first, or will the methylone not have a cross-effect with the mdma? will I raise my tolerance by taking the methylone before the mdma? when I say ""before"", I mean on separate days. how long between rolls should I wait?

also, what would you all suggest as a good attack dose and then boost dose for the methylone? and out of curiousity's sake, what about the mdma?

how do ketamine and methylone mix? I don't have any questions about ketamine, I seem to be able to handle that drug just fine. :)

I am fairly comfortable with the 2c-e, as I have tried it a few times in the past, but this seems like a larger dose than I am used to. should I just split it into 9mg doses and insnuffulate them on two separate occassions?

Ive been too worried to try it because my last shrooming experience was a pretty big mindfuck. I have done shrooms a few times before, but this time I think I might have taken too much (about an 8th) and it blew me out to space. 

Now I have some questions for you guys about LSD that everyone on other threads and forums can only give vague and unsatisfying answers to. I will use my last shroom trip as a preface to the questions. I hope you guys can help me out. 

1.  During my last shroom trip I had an episode of extreme confusion. I was walking home while it was kicking in and suddenly I forgot where I was, where I was going and how long I has been somewhere else. Through out the trip, but mostly at the beginning, I had this severe confusion, will that happen on acid? 

2. On shrooms it felt as though I was on autopilot. Like the things I said and the way I behaved where out of my control. It was like Watching a movie. This is what I'm most scared of happening again. I felt like I had no control over my reasoning or mental capability. Will this happen on acid? 

3. What are the chances of thought loops happening on one hit of acid? On shrooms I had thought loops and loop speaking. I would keep repeating the same thing over and over for a while. 

4. Does an LSD trip have a defined peak and come down? With shrooms it felt as though it started taking effect then it got turned up to 11 for the whole 5-6 hour trip and then a sudden end. There didn't seem to be any come down period. 

5. My shroom trip had periods of realizations and enlightenment (It wasn't just some huge shit, though a lot of it was) but I never felt any strong feelings of euphoria or happiness. It was just a roller coaster of mixed emotions. From my understanding, extreme euphoria, permagrins and excitement are a defining characteristic of tripping, is it different for LSD?

If I consume at night and immediately go to sleep, I usually have the headache shortly after waking.  If I consume earlier in the day I'll wake up in the middle of the night and won't be able to get back to sleep due to pain.  No other noticeable symptoms.  

* The length of the headache seems to increase with dosage (perhaps 8 hours on lowest dose I've taken, 24 on highest)
* Pain and initial onset seem to remain about the same regardless of dosage.
* Laying down seems to greatly aggravate pain compared to standing/sitting upright.  
* Hydration doesn't seem to be the cause.
* Contamination is unlikely.
* Removing myself from light/sound doesn't seem to have an impact.  
* Tylenol/Acetaminophen helps a little.
* The 2 different strains I've tried don't seem to change the effect.
* I am not on any other medication and don't take anything else with the mushrooms.

I've found anecdotal reports online of a small number of people who present the same symptoms, but there doesn't seem to be any concrete info out there about why a small percentage of the population would have this problem.  Hydration, contamination, and serotonin syndrome-like effects are the only 3 causes I've seen speculation about and I have ruled out the first 2.  I've been trying to read up on the effects shrooms have on serotonin and compare to MDMA, but haven't been able to fully connect the dots.

My questions:

1. Does it make sense that shrooms could cause serotonin syndrome in certain people?
2. Would 5-HTP taken as though I had taken MDMA be something worth trying?
3. One report said acetaminophen taken at the same time as the shrooms had helped - does that make sense?

**The Back Story**

About four weeks ago now,  I was on the hunt for some quality blotter. My friends assured me that they had some, but stipulated that it ""water coating"" on it, which gave it a funky taste. I was skeptical, but decided to try it anyway. I purchased three hits, and immediately took them - true to form, they tasted horrible and chemical, tipping me off to the potential of an RC. In fact, they tasted so bad, that instead of holding them under my tongue (as they had told me to do; I assumed that whatever was on the blotters was only sublingually or buccally active) I swallowed them immediately. 

I figured that if that was the case, swallowing them would yield no effect. Imagine my surprise when about an hour later, I start tripping... **HARD**. Even more puzzling was the fact that the trip was very LSD like - stimulating, with the unique body high that only LSD seems to have. It lasted about 7 hours, with very little comedown.

What this comes down is: can LSD have a ""water coating""? And, if any veteran psychonauts would care to provide their input, what chemical do you think it was, given that the come up was an hour and the trip lasted for 7?",,False,,t5_2s8ie,False,,,True,t3_vn97e,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/vn97e/lsd_with_water_coating/,

Is that possible?

Because of the chemical similarity to neurotransmitters, I'm wondering if neurons would reuptake the psychedelic chemicals, only to reuse them as if they were a regular neurotransmitter. These psychedelics would then be reused by the brain during regular communication between neurons.

If psychedelic chemicals were being used by the brain as neurotransmitters during intoxication, it would vastly alter the way our brain communicates with itself. Because most psychedelics are agonists for multiple receptors, this could alter not only the intensity of agonism but the types of receptors communicated with.

Three days ago, a friend and I took what I thought was ecstasy for the first time (I thought I could trust the source but apparently not), but it ended up being what I think was a high dose of amphetamine. I've never done either drug, but I've done a fair amount of research and it didn't have much of the euphoria I'd expect from X, and definitely fit the symptom list for amphetamine: it kept us up all night, rapid heart beat, etc... So fast forward to the next night. My heart rate was still fairly high, but I was able to get a good night's sleep after a few drinks, and I thought that would be the end of it. When I woke up, however, I started noticing some new, troubling symptoms. My pulse felt (and still feels) weaker than normal. My heart rate has slowed drastically, but I can't feel my pulse in either wrist and it feels faint in the neck. Last night (the night after getting rest) I again could not sleep for the majority of the night. Both yesterday and today I have felt very awake during the day as well. Also, I've noticed some chest pains, more on the left side, and some very minor tingling in the hands and fingers, also more prevalent on the left. I've read that if something bad were to happen from an amphetamine overdose, it would likely happen soon after taking the drug, but still, these symptoms seem very troubling... Is there any reason why I would still be feeling the effects/after-effects of the drug? Obviously it doesn't help that I'm worrying about it, and I plan on seeing a doctor when I get a chance, just to be safe, but does anyone know what could be going on?

I was heading out to a party, and was coming up about 1h and 30m in getting dressed up to go, at this point I was very smiley and felt great being at home and around sober family and other friends who were tripping. We all took the light rail downtown and walked to the party, as soon as I got there I started to feel very empty. The party hadn't started and only the people who lived there were around, and I knew them but we'd had a falling out, I felt like I didn't know them as well as I used to (which I feel when sober too). So this could contribute to that feeling of extreme boredom / emptiness. Almost the whole time, I was just realizing how much I suck at being social (Especially for a new year eve's party) but when I was with my good group of friends I was having a good time. I also met a girl who was from NY and she sparked my interest in a very intense way. I knew she was into me, and we chatted almost the whole night, but everything she revealed about herself just made me more frustrated with myself.. (IE : She was a year younger than me, 19, but had taken part in Occupy Wall St in NY and occupy oakland when briefly visiting California, so she actively pursued her dreams and passions, she was dancing when no on else really was, and she wanted me to as well (I felt like I was one of the most awkward people.. but I almost never dances unless I'm totally in my zone) I never did dance with her, and she had to ask me to kiss her, which I did and it was nice, and she even wanted to hook up but she left to go eat with her friend and mom, so I was stuck at this house party while my friends were packing up to leave, and making the decision to stay or go was one of the most tormenting things. I was with all my friends and even my out of state cousin was tripping with us, so I made the decision to walk back home with them and my cousin (who would need to walk back from the lightrail whilst being a girl). Despite having some pretty good times (about 10 of us made a blanket fort) At the end of the night I felt like I had a bad trip even though only about 30-40% was questionably bad. I felt like the girl I met (named Zoo) was like a messenger or mirror of myself, she was asking hard questions that really made me evaluate my life. Since the trip I've felt like my set point for happiness has been noticeably lower.. it's been seemingly picking back up (most notably today) but this experience has taken me from loving acid (done it 3 times before) to being almost incredibly scared of it. 

I guess it was the set and setting, but I still feel like I need some sort of closure. 

The most frustrating part is that I felt mostly sober and I don't know if this is what a bad trip is like.

So can anyone help me by talking about a bad trip they had, even if it is mild like this?

Background: I'm 16 and have been dealing with depression/suiccidal thoughts for two years.

Up until now I've been too embarrassed to tell my parents about it.

Recently, though, I was prescribed vicodin and I feel fucking fantastic. I don't think I've felt this great since before highschool. I don't feel high, just a little dizzy and very content. I do marijuana frequently and although it usually halts my symptoms it is usually an active happiness that I can feel will subside rather than a passive contentedness.

Sorry for rambling. Anyways, my question is, is this just an effect of the vicodin messing with me? Or is this possible through anti-depressants/therapy? I would really like to make this permanent.

TLDR depressed for years, vicodin alleviates this in ways cannabis/alcohol have not been able to, is this possible through anti-depressants/therapy or is it solely a side effect of the vicodin ""high"" (don't really feel high)

If you don't want to read my experiences to get an idea of what I've done so far, and want to pass along general advice, skip the following paragraphs.

==

I'm relatively new to taking shrooms. My friend got some, and without any kind of mental preparation I dove into taking an eighth with him for my first time. On the drive back (about an hour, he drove) the euphoria was seriously hitting strong. We were smoking as well, and I generally just felt different. Almost goofy. Definite euphoria, but other than that I couldn't describe my situation.

We got back to my apartment and it was there that the visuals kicked in. We smoked more, played some video games, watched some TV, tripped out and talked, generally just lounged around. It was fun for a while, but I started to get some depression during it -- just a general mindset of ""what the fuck am I doing, taking drugs in this shitty apartment on a saturday night?"". I just wanted it to stop, and even started becoming introspective into my own life, generally being unhappy with what I was thinking. This is *very* strange for me as, in any other mindset, I always look forward to experimenting with drugs. When I smoke pot or take molly/mdma (the only drugs I have experience with) I never regret doing so, before during or afterwards it's always a good experience. Hell, even on two of my three shroom trips I felt perfectly fine immediately afterwards.

I may need to point out that my friend became extremely uncooperative during my first trip. We played games I didn't like (Nazi Zombies fucking scared the hell out of me), he wandered around aimlessly sometimes and generally I couldn't connect with him on any significant level. This might attribute to future trips. He's also the only person I've ever tripped with, and we've always stayed in my apartment which is aesthetically very plain, though we do have a very large projection screen with Netflix and tons of video games.

Since that first shroom trip I've taken them two other times. One time was just one cap, I got extremely mild visuals and a small body high, but once again, mentally I hated the situation. I should mention, however, that I was alone that day. Then I made a massive mistake and took a quarter of shrooms a week later, again with the same friend. He freaked out about being alone, even though we were hanging out, and was pacing with a bat in his hand. He scared the hell out of me, and kicked the sofa because I couldn't physically move. I was crying, begging him to stop and I was literally in physical pain, and then puked for the first time in like 10 years. I went to bed, could not get physically comfortable, lost all sense of time and literally felt like I was going to die. I thought I overdosed, and my brain was shutting down lobe by lobe. I got auditory hallucinations, then my mind went absolutely quiet. Not a thought in my mind. I laid in bed for 7 hours, minutes passed as if they were seconds or hours throughout. I remember it being 7:27 for what objectively felt like 3 hours to me. Absolutely the single worst moment of my life, though I can attribute that to taking too much and being in a bad setting. I haven't done anything but ecstasy and weed since then, about 2-3 months ago

==

Anyway, those are my experiences. Ever since then I feel like I've had a small amount of latent depression. I don't generally like what I'm doing with my life (drop-out, working full time with parents and living at home during the week because it's closer to work, nothing close to a girlfriend) but at the same time, I'm very happy with many parts of my life. I have good friends, I'm making good money, I write music and play guitar and actually have label attention because of it, I have a good sense of humor and I'm very highly regarded by my friends as being funny, an intellectual, a good musician, good tastes in music, what have you.. yet I'm just generally an unhappy person. I think this started about a week after I took that quarter.

The major point that scares me to experiment more with psychoactives are my **extremely mild** suicidal thoughts. I never, ever, EVER actually sit with a bottle of pills or a razor in my hand and seriously contemplate taking my life, but I **do** occasionally feel like I'm just tired of living, and think about what it'd be like to end it. I would absolutely never actually attempt to kill myself, but on shrooms or (sometimes) large amounts of pot, the feelings get heightened and it starts seeming like a good idea. Drug use makes me feel pinned to the situation, and if I'm having a less than ideal time I start thinking about how I truly want it to end, and suicide pops in my head as an actually reasonable option. Yet, again, I have absolute mental control over it and would never attempt doing so, because I truly do love enough parts of my life to make it worth living for me.

I recently found a source for LSD and 2C-I and I would very much like to try them, but my history legitimately scare me. I feel like if I take them, I'll either rid myself of all of my depression or succumb to another introspective, horrible trip and actually try to kill myself, and that obviously makes me very hesitant to try them, even though I truly want to.

Has anyone ever taken psychoactives in a less-than-ideal state of mind? Is there any chance that my horrible trip with shrooms might just be causing latent depression and having a similarly extremely good experience would erase it? Or should I just stay away from all mind-altering things until I get my shit together?

Thank you so much for reading all of this if you did. If not,

*tl;dr*: I took a quarter of shrooms, felt like I was going to die for 6 hours and have had mild depressive episodes since then, with extremely rare suicidal thoughts that I'd never act on. Can more psychoactives (not shrooms) help alleviate these feelings, or should I stay away from them until I'm mentally in better shape?

At this point, I'd rather try to eliminate as much water as possible and see how much apvp really is in there.  It must be more than 2-3 grams because tests suggest it was as strong as 20mg oral.

Is the best method to put it over a very low heat? like dump in a coffee pot and turn the plate on? or  a tiny flame over the stove with a fan blowing on?  Low heat in the oven?

On Friday afternoon I drank a tea of [Passiflora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passiflora) and [Hypericum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypericum). The effect was very very mild but enough slightly increase my mood. 

Even though I was aware that both of these plants may have some MAOIs in them , I kinda blanked it out. 

A few hours later, I had smoked 2 joints and drank a coffee. To top it off I drank an energy drink with Guarana in it.

A few moments later all hell broke lose in my body. Blood pressure and pulse shot trough the roof. I was entirely certain that I would die about 2 hours after it started.  My mind was clear enough to talk to a friend on Skype but my body was shaking and my heart hammered against my chest. (no headache)

On Saturday I could barely move without my blood pressure going high enough to make me wobbly on my feet. On Sunday someone drove me to the ER to check what was going on. Blood and Urin did not show anything special. The cardiologist checked my heart and told me that its fine. Their conclusion : Smoke less weed.

Today is Monday and my blood pressure is still 140/100 - 160/100. Pulse is around 75-90. (Usually its 120/85 , 75 pulse)


I feel like the docs did not really take me seriously after hearing ""Cannabis"".

About 2 years ago I did an extraction using some Mimosa hostilis root bark and [Noman's tek](http://wiki.dmt-nexus.me/Noman's_tek), and found myself in possession of a beautiful couple grams of off-white/maybe a little bit yellow crystal/powder.

I'm a student. I don't really have any attention problems, nor do I have difficulty studying for tests or keeping concentration even for hours at a time to what most would consider quite boring.

Yet, I'm in college. I don't think that my school can deal out prescriptions, and I've actually never really gotten a prescription before in my life. Would I just go to the hospital and ask to see a doctor for a checkup and mention that I have problems paying attention? How much would this cost? What information should I have before going?

I've been interested in shrooms, and my SO's coworker sold me a capsule. I've read about recommended mushroom dosages, and from what I understand, you'd need at least a couple of packed capsules to do the trick. 

I just got my capsule, and it's way less than half filled with fine whitish powder. I was told that it's way less than a gram but a guaranteed trip and perfect for a first-timer's taste of psychedelics.  (I believe .002 or .02 was the number given to me, I no longer have the text. But there was a 2 somewhere behind that decimal point.) 

Considering everything I've read on other subreddits, this doesn't add up; that dosage seems wildly small and I'm a little sketched out, especially since this would be my first trip.

Is it possible that this is some extra potent extract or some such, hence the tiny dosage? Is this normal? I'm not able to speak personally with this coworker.

I feel like I'm being too cautious. Thoughts?

The first time I took 117 ug laughed hysterically with another friend and saw cool visuals on my blanket and the tv. Enjoyed that a lot. Took about 170 ug again a week later, laughed and began perceiving depth in a strange way. Enjoyed that experience a lot too. Then last night, I took about 250 ug with no tolerance (1 month since my last trip) and had a pretty bad trip. I was laughing on the come up, kidding around with my friend and telling him I thought I was him (because when I talked to him I saw him and not me) and having fun altogether. Then, I peaked at around 4 hours and had a salvia flashback. I thought I was dead, I didn't believe my IDs and I thought my friends were all lying to me. I couldn't separate myself from the environment and objects. Complete ego-death, I thought every person was part of me. It was really terrifying and similar to salvia. To be honest, I can't remember much except the fear. My hands, feet and dick constantly felt wet like they did on shrooms and I was drooling. The most awful part was thinking that LSD was like being dead and eventually I would die and be trapped in an awful trip.

I really enjoyed LSD my first two times, but this last trip brought me to tears. What went wrong? Too much lsd with no tolerance? If I only take 1 tab at a time, is it likely that I will experience ego-death again? I know some of you guys really like the spiritual aspects of LSD and the way it makes you ponder your existence, but I do not. I just want some cool visuals and laughter. I don't mind wild thoughts, but when I become convinced that I am dead and trapped in limbo with everyone being a figment of my imagination and trying to deceive me - there is a problem.

I did smoke weed the first time and this last time, as well. I believe I restarted my LSD trip with weed yesterday as I smoked a joint when coming down and ended up tripping for ~17 hours in total. I did enjoy the final calm down somewhat as I had nice rushes of euphoria, but there was still too much anxiety. Any advice?

When I first got ketamine I was very cautious, I initially took small doses in my room to make sure I didn't instantly keel over (I didn't even notice the effects because I was just sitting in my room with nothing really to play with), I will now take ~50-70mg of ketamine on a night out after having one or two drinks and be totally fine.

Ideally I don't want to do the same testing process with MXE, I find it not much fun doing drugs alone in my room. Will I be OK taking it on a night out considering I get on fine with ketamine? Does it mix very badly with alcohol or would a couple of drinks be fine? Also will 20mg be enough (probably going to snort it but am considering swallowing/sublingualling). 20mg of K would do pretty much nothing to me. 

Also - I find ketamine stops me sleeping even three hours after dosing. Is MXE as bad/worse for this?

Thanks all. ",,False,,t5_2s8ie,False,,,True,t3_19q17z,http://www.reddit.com/r/askdrugs/comments/19q17z/first_time_with_mxe/,
