Then I saw somebody had already made one, and that took some of the wind out of my sails. Sorry about that. But hey, I made it, intending to share it, so here it is. I hope this makes your next SG-1 marathon more interesting.

...

...

Take a sip of your drink if/when (or multiple if noted)....

**Stargate Command/Others**

* Every time someone is promoted.
* ""Unscheduled off-world activation"", no matter who says it.
* Stargate ""kawoosh"" and anybody flinches.
* Two if a kawoosh kills somebody (two per kill; finish your drink if it takes out a ship, or more than one ship).
* The camera goes through the wormhole (on-screen tunnel effect).
* Someone reacts badly to wormhole travel (dizzy, sick, hands to the knees).
* Every time the gate is dialed without the SGC dialing computer or a DHD.
* One for every Iris splat (something comes through and can't dematerialize due to the Iris).
* Shots come through the Stargate and hit somewhere in the Gate room (per scene, not per shot).
* Pop culture reference (another show, a movie/series, etc.),
* Two if it's one involving a Stargate actor's other roles,
* Three for each first occurence of a Star Trek actor. Do not repeat in future episodes for the same actor.
* Somebody gets sent to a ""bad"" gate (black hole, ice planet, etc.) as punishment for being a d-bag,
* Two if they're given the addresses and left to do it to themselves.
* Every time a Stargate is referred to as a ""Chappa'ai"" (limit once per scene),
* Two if it's referred to as anything else (e.g. magic circle, ring of light) (same limit).
* Siler gets hurt, or is shown to have been injured.
* General Hammond says ""You have a go"" or ""Godspeed"".
* General Hammond pronounces ""weapon"" as ""wheapon"".
* An entire episode passes without an exterior Cheyenne Mountain shot with the two airmen pacing back and forth.

**Jack O'Neill**

* Jack cuts someone off for talking technically.
* Jack drinks a beer,
* Two if he offers one to someone else.
* Jack professes his love for the Asgard or Thor,
* Two if he has anything bad to say about them (not joking).
* Jack professes his distrust for the Tok'ra,
* Two if he has anything good to say about them (not sarcasm) (Jacob excluded).
* Jack tries to get somebody to go fishing with him,
* Two if they actually do.
* Jack mocks a Goa'uld.
* Jack and Sam romance in any form,
* Two if they kiss.

**Teal'c**

* Every time T says ""Indeed"". Yes, EVERY time, but only if that's all he says, unless he adds a name (e.g. ""Indeed, Daniel Jackson"")
* Two if somebody else says only ""Indeed"". (Very rare.)
* Two if Teal'c calls anybody by their first name without their last name.
* Every time Teal'c is asked a question and he merely stares. Every question unanswered.
* If Teal'c smiles.
* Three if he LAUGHS.
* Teal'c and Jack bromance in any form.
* Every time after first appearing in Earth/SG garb, Teal'c appears in Jaffa garb
* Two every time Teal'c actually quits SG-1 or goes somewhere with Bra'tac, without SG-1.

**Daniel Jackson**

* Daniel sneezes (pretty much only Season 1).
* Daniel appears in a scene without glasses for whatever reason (unless he puts them on, e.g. when waking up).
* Daniel translates an alien language (e.g. Goa'uld),
* Two if he translates an Earth language (e.g. Russian, Chinese).
* Daniel mentions Sha're.
* Daniel needs more time to do anything.
* Daniel dies,
* Two when he comes back (sarcophagus, whatever).
* Drink once each time Daniel and Jack say one anothers' names after they've both said the other's once each.

**Samantha Carter**

* Sam calls O'Neill ""Jack"" without rank or ""Sir"".
* Every five seconds of Carter technobabble until interrupted, drink.
* Sam mentions Jolinar (her one-time Tok'ra symbiote).
* Two for every lover of Sam's who dies.

**The Goa'uld/Jaffa**

* Every time a Goa'uld speaks in a menacing or condescending manner (one per scene).
* Two when a main Goa'uld dies (or you think they do).
* Two more when they inevitably come back.
* Every time the eyes flash white.
* Two if the host speaks (normal voice). The Tok'ra are exempt.
* Jaffa, kree! Every time, regardless of who says it.
* Shol'va, every time it's said to/about Teal'c, Bra'tac, or other rebel Jaffa.
* Fancy animal helmet raised or lowered (Jaffa, early seasons).",,False,,t5_2qhar,1347933351.0,,,True,t3_101qr3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/101qr3/stargate_sg1_s18_drinking_game/,

I don't care if this has been tried in the past or not, we need to let MGM know that we want more Stargate. 

This is a multi million dollar franchise which made them a lot of money in the past, I doubt they don't believe it can do so any more.

Here is MGM's twitter account: [https://twitter.com/MGM_Studios](https://twitter.com/MGM_Studios), if you have an account go ask them about SG's future.

In just a few days we begin our year-long journey through the 17 seasons of the Stargate saga! So check your hyper-drive engines, collect your DVDs, run a diagnostic on your dialing computer, check your Netflix account, take aboard your zats!

We're taking off

**January 1st, 2013**

[**REWATCH SCHEDULE**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0ArQqVI_VAicQdDdwZmxHVHloRzJuWExBOGdfUkxFcVE&amp;output=html)
&gt; ~~Including alternate watching options!~~

---

The schedule is based on [this](http://log.nateperkins.net/stargate/). On a one episode per
day plan we should be done by December 19th, 2013. If there is a full-length/final cut version of an episode/multi-parter, then the full-length/final cut is chosen. The Audiobooks and Kino Webisodes are optional, but are ordered chronologically as best as possible. If you spot a mistake though - let me know.

---

~~To organize things a little: first one to make a comment every episode entitles it by the Episode Tag so the rest of us can reply to that post, i.e.~~

&gt;   ~~#213 Atl 02x08~~

~~**Please comment in the designated reply-comments, so we don't make a mess in the comment section throughout the year.**~~

[~~Confused?~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/15jqcp/official_reddits_stargate_community_2013_rewatch/c7n47mp)


~~To sum it up: [**NO COMMENTS IN THE 1st LEVEL COMMENTS: PLEASE COMMENT IN THE # COMMENTS ONLY, PLEASE HIT THE REPLY BUTTON**](http://i.imgur.com/6rWsw.png) - so it stays clean. Every other comments will be removed.~~

~~Thank you for helping us help you help us all!~~

~~Organization notes: A mod will do one official thread at the beginning of a week - you'll be welcome to discuss it there!~~

---

EDIT: 30 XII 2012

**Organization notes**

**One thread per episode**, somebody makes a thread every day for the daily content if a mod didn't already created one. Please note the naming pattern of new threads:

&gt; [&lt;#&gt; &lt;episode_tag&gt;] &lt;title&gt;

&gt; [#213 Atl 02x08] Conversion

&gt; [#287 SG-1 Movie 1] The Ark of Truth

You can **copy** the name directly from the shedule, from the column ""CopyPasta Thread Name Helper"".

Please **don't mix numbers** together, i.e. Audiobook and Episode, or Webisode and Episode, Atlantis and SG-1, etc.

The threads will be **indexed** in the sidebar and schedule for future reference.

Thank you for all the helpful feedback! I wrongly assumed that the comments could be organized in just one thread, but it complicates things to the point when it wouldn't be fun anymore, just moderation and annoyment, and that's not what a community project should be about.

EDIT: 7 I 2013

You can also post a **link** to the [Stargate Wiki](http://stargate.wikia.com/wiki/Children_of_the_Gods) with the episode in topic.

I spent all last Christmas break watching SG-1 and the months after that watching Atlantis, and I was a hardcore fan by the time they announced the cancellation of SGU. Now, I wasn't as head over heels with SGU as I was with Atlantis or SG-1, but now we have nothing. Even Star Trek has the new movies, but Stargate is, as far as anyone can tell, caput for the foreseeable future. 

Basically, I'm afraid it will go the way of Babylon 5 and never come back. I became a fan of Stargate during its twilight year and now the absence of any great sci fi TV show or movie series (Trek is taking its sweet ass time) besides Doctor Who has just left me with a void in my soul. 

Does anyone know if Stargate will come back anytime soon? They canceled the SGU, then the Atlantis movie and the planned SG-1 movie. Is Stargate gone forever?",,False,,t5_2qhar,False,,,True,t3_mjt81,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/mjt81/i_miss_stargate/,

Spoilers abound.,dragonfyre4269,95,15,97,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/1bp75c/my_thoughts_on_why_we_will_never_see_a_4th/,"Before I begin I am writing this from strictly a storytelling standpoint, because that I understand, the whole business part involving rights and money and all that fun stuff I don't understand so I won't be involving it.  Also 99% of this is going to be a spoiler so I'm only going to be using spoiler tags for things that would stand out, and that's assuming I can figure out how to even use them.

Short answer:  [Earth is screwed.](/s)

Here's why.  

Point 1:  [They have an abundance of enemies and no allies to speak of.](/s)  Let's take stock of their allies over the course of the 3 series and 14 years.  [Asguard: dead.  The Tollan: dead  Tok'ra: MIA since the fall of the system lords.  Free Jaffa: Too fractured to be of any help even if they wanted to.  Langarans(Jonas quinn's people): was once willing to help but since the fiasco in an episode of SGU who knows how much help they would be willing to lend now, plus their tech level is quite a bit lower then ours.  The Hebridians: last check in the Ori got to them, even if they were left relatively unscathed their tech was more advanced then earths baseline tech but not as advanced as the Asguard tech we got from them](/s)  Now let's take stock of their enemies [The Wraith:  May not be able to get to earth anymore and generally too busy fighting amongst themselves to be bothered with trying, but if they could get their stuff together and actually attack earth it would be devastating.  The Lucien Alliance: A very serious threat that has been shown to have operations on earth and has been shown to be able to advance their tech faster then earth can and has access to vastly more resources then earth does.  The Free people of the Pegasus galaxy:  Probably not too happy that earth went back on that whole we'll help you fight the wraith more then we have been deal.  The Rogue Asguard: Probably unable to reach earth and not much inclined to do so.  And this isn't even talking about all the small bit villains we only see for 1 or 2 episodes (The foothold aliens, the Aschen etc.) or the things we met in SG:Universe cause they in all likelihood couldn't get to earth anyway](/s)

Point 2: Earth has a major tactical weakness, they need to operate in secret from the general public of earth.  All any of their enemies need to do is break the masquerade and boom earth self destructs on itself, we saw this happen in an alternate universe.  The really bad part is the Lucien alliance SHOULD know this, all they have to do to beat earth is land a mothership in central park and send out the swarm of clearly alien lifeforms, pop the space champagne and celebrate their win. 

Point 3:  Earth has a major numbers disadvantage.  Earth at best has the resources of earth and a few off world mining operations and a few allies that are/can send them stuff.  The Lucien alliance has presumably at least several entire star systems entirely under their control.  Even though earth has better tech then anybody around right now, the Ancients had better tech then the wraith and they still lost, the wraith beat them with pure numbers and the tech gap was much bigger in that case.

TL:DR [If there is a new Stargate series that is not a continuity reboot, and is written on par with the rest of the series, barring a Dues ex. Machina the Lucien alliance beats earth in 5 episodes](/s)

So the introduction of the Ori is a bit abrupt.

Still, I really liked the last two seasons.  I liked Mitchel.  I liked Vala.  I even liked Jonas in season 6.  I realize Richard Dean Anderson was a big part of why people watched the show, but I still enjoyed the show after his departure.

I liked how the Ori changed the game completely, and how it was no longer about military might and strategy.  It was more about knowledge and technology, exploring the Ancients, and in many ways was a refined take on many of the themes of false gods and subjugation that run through the rest of the series.

I actually thought the writing in 9 and 10 was some of the better writing in the series.  They had to abandon self-contained stories and actually write consistent season-long arcs that built to something.

But it seems like a lot of people really hated the last two seasons.  Some think it was a departure.  I think it was a natural progression.

I'd love to see some lengthy reviews or criticisms for the last two seasons that have detail and thought.

Thoughts?

Since then, I've watched all the Star Trek, Babylon 5, Battlestar Galactica, a bunch of other sci-fi and drama, and have started watching Stargate SG-1. I love it, and I've been powering through it. So, this is as far as I've gotten...

S06E08, I think it is, ""The Other Guys"" was the name of the episode. The two scientists who mount a rescue operation when SG-1 are captured by the Jaffa/Goa'uld. One of these guys is a huge Trekkie. Goes to conventions, loves the Vulcans (and possibly Klingons). References to red shirts, Gene Roddenberry, and a couple others. Oh, and there's a Klingon bat'leth (the crescent sword the Klingons fight with) behind the Goa'uld's chair about midway through the episode.

I just thought it was awesome, here are a couple of Stargate and Star Trek fans right on Stargate. (The other guy was actually a Stargate fan; his heroes were O'Neill, Teal'C, and Carter.) (They've actually referenced Stargate fandom before; in addition to the entire episode ""Wormhole X-Treme!"", there was the part where O'Neill laughed off the possibility of a show about SG-1, saying nobody would be interested in that, or nobody would watch it. All that was missing, was a wink at the camera.)

So, why didn't Star Trek do anything like this? Okay, fair enough, it was set 400 years in the future. Still, Star Wars would be legendary. George Lucas' heirs would still be making sequels and remakes. I'm pretty sure the space-faring future of Earth will make all kinds of references to the sci-fi of the past. A reference to the Force, the Jedi, or something like that would not have been out of place. Especially since in The Next Generation, it was explicitly stated a couple times that they had access to ""all the media from Earth ever recorded"". That implies they have and can watch Star Wars on the Enterprise, if they were so inclined. Probably also on DS9; certainly on Voyager.

Product placement sucks, but popular culture references are fun. Stargate hasn't crossed the line yet. They're well on the safe side, in fact.",,False,,t5_2qhar,False,,,True,t3_x1uk9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stargate/comments/x1uk9/what_stargate_has_that_star_trek_lacked/,

If a ZPM is essentially a bridge to another dimension (where it extracts its energy from), how is it possible for a ZPM to be ""Empty"".
There would be no ""full"" or ""empty"" state, if it pulls energy from another dimension. Unless the ZPM stores the energy within it?

Likewise, if this is true and the ZPM stores energy within itself, then it cannot be empty either, as it would constantly be replenishing its own energy from that alternate ""dimension"".

If we play it on the positive side and show our support no matter what comes our way, MGM will notice, and eventually deliver.

**To set your flair simply click EDIT next to your username in the sidebar. Then choose a flair, hit SAVE and you're done!**

In the future we plan to add custom text flairs next to the symbols but the coding is messy so don't hold my word on that. We'll see... Also mods will have other symbols to distinguish them.

Write in the comments what **other symbols** you want to be added to the list! We'll make sure everybody's gonna get what they want so far as we can.

First post here and I just wanted to say hi!

I am the moderator of /r/babylon5 and I am always excited when people come in and announce they are watching for the first time.

Well, it's my turn to return the favor. I am watching SG1 for the first time.

Ok, it's not 100% true. I had bought a show (don't remember which) which came with the first 6 episodes of SG-1 and I had watched them then, perhaps 4 years ago.

I hated them. It was tacky, cheezy, boring and franctly, bad TV.

More recently, I discovered SG:U and it's one of my favorite show. I watched it in real time, discovering it as it was playing and kept finding it amazing.

Recently, my wife got into SG:U and I thought, hey, why should I not take this as an opportunity to watch SG:1.

The first 6 episodes? Still tacky. Still cheezy. Still boring. But I kept going and you know what? In retrospect, they are NOT that cheezy and boring.

I am just used to dark TV shows like Babylon 5, SG:U, Dexter, and the light mood of SG-1 was something I didn't expect.

I began to like it and you know what, I became hooked.

This morning, while working, I watched the first 2 episodes of Season 2 and can't wait to continue.

I know a LOT of spoilers about the future and kind of regret that.

I am trying to watch as many episodes as possible to be able to catch your current rewatch and post my comments upon the first watch of the day's episode.

I can't promise I won't run ahead thought.. it is quite of a great show.

The replicators are one the only 2 enemied to show up in 2 different series (the other being the Lucian Alliance in SG1 and SGU).

The Lucian Alliance doesn't play a big role in either series, but the replicators were unique in that they had not ONE, but TWO different origins.

Granted, it's not the SAME replicators, but the same Asgard weapon works on both at first until they adapt.

Both behave similarly including the ability to enter one's mind.

Did you guys like them a lot because they sure take a lot of screen time.

I mean, I love the Asgard and many SG1 episodes with the replicators have Thor in it and that's GOOD.

But overtime, I feel like Baa'l, the Ori, the Wraiths, Michael, even the SGU Drones were more interesting in the long term than the Replicators.

Am I missing something? 

Fights against the other enemies seem to me to be more interesting. It took cunning, orginality to destroy  Ga'ould or a Wraith Hive. It took great lengths to destroy an ORI ship.

I'm a prosthetics student learning about hand transplant surgeries in my upper limb prosthetics class.  In the presentation my professor was giving she talked about removing bone marrow from the donor and giving it to the host during transplant, I believe this method is called the Pittsburgh Protocol.  As I was listening to the lecture I realized I had heard of this method before.  In SGU S2E14: Hope; Volker is given a new kidney from Greer, and injected with some of Greer's bone marrow in hopes of forming a blended chimera.

There is a major difference between what happens in reality and what happens in SGU though.  In reality the individual still has to take anti-rejection meds, however the number of meds is greatly reduced.  In the show the hope was to prevent the need of the drugs since they didn't have any.  I would call this hopeful fiction rooted in facts/practices.

The Gua'uld were each individual characters, each with their own backstory, personalities, and motives. This often resulted in them warring eachother. The show allowed us to explore each of their personalities and such, and beyond the show into real-world mythology.

The replicators were sort of bland, but we essentially got to see their creation, and their evolution into human-type replicators.

The Ori were a throwback from what we knew of the ancients, but the expanse of allies and other beings in the Milky way made them interesting.

The Milky way galaxy just seems to be much more dynamic and expansive as a result, with complex enemies, allies, alliences and whatnot.


In atlantis, there is one nemesis. This nemesis is driven entirely by nature, and is argueably just doing what they need to survive. The enemies are all the same race (Making reusing actors commonplace), and thus essentially the same people, making the encounters with them predictable.

But I understand you're a business and you can never have enough money and blah blah blah 
So, I've gone and solved your problem.

So, this is what you do. 

Continue shooting SGU but release it D2n (direct to Internet). You can charge per episode or sell season passes. 

Your business model is outdated and completely useless. Ratings mean nothing in this day in age. I cannot remember the last time I sat infront of a Television for more than 30 minutes.

First of all, you are catering to a super small and specific market of scifi fans in the United States. 

You see, unless you live in the USA you don't have access to these awesome shows as they air IF and WHEN they ever do air outside of the US it's usually months if not years after the original air date and by then who cares? 

This is what I don't understand... Why would you limit yourself to such a small market when you have an untapped universal medium that reaches 90% of the human population? Why not open up to the world. People like myself who currently live outside of the US have only one option when I want to watch your programing and that's to pirate them. 

Let me break this down for you into tiny, easy to follow steps so you can grasp it. 

1. Shoot an episode.
2. Provide subtitles in every major language making it easy for non-english speakers to enjoy. 
3. Release D2n ( Direct to Net) (You can do D2n alongside the traditional way as well if you like)
4. Charge a reasonable fee per episode / season...
5. Profit

Not only will the people pay to watch this awesome show they will hail SyFy for leaving a dead business model and moving into the 21st century. People will pay and watch for that reason alone. 

As someone who lives outside the US and has to pirate your show I can tell you that I would happily give you my money if you followed this model.
