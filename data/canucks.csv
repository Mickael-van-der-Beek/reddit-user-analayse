His will to win is unmatched. You can hear it in his post game interviews, you can see it on the ice. It's a long shot, but I hope this postseason isn't the last time we'll be LUUUU'ing. 

I really like Cory Schneider as well. As a goaltender and a person. He's bright, funny, and very sound positionally. However, I feel like it could be in the team's best interest to trade Cory, because a guy like him would have higher demand and a higher return.

I hope these games aren't Luongo's last in Vancouver. I would hate to see him go out playing great and falling short because the team can't score goals. 

Anyways, thanks Lu. For being our team MVP, our captain, and our leader. Thanks for the dozens of great memories. Thanks for putting up with some terrible Vancouver media, and thanks for handling the goaltending controversy with nothing but class and a little humor.

White wine crawled sluggishly down the wallpaper, broken glass settled into place.
Gina walked over to the corner table and uncorked another bottle, shooting her husband a furious look.
""Well?!?""
Roberto's eyes searched the room nervously until at last, meeting with his wives.
""Well, Mike says the cap has dropped, it's a new environment. Cory had to go.""
Gina's eyes widened with rage.
""What suddenly, Mike, is calling the shots around here?!"" 
She tipped the bottle and slugged down half its contents.
""You have to stop being such a pussy, and get out of that rainy hell hole.""
Roberto looked down at his feet, tapping side to side. It was a nervous tic on ice too, during the national anthem. He immediately stopped and once again, looked up to meet his wives stare.
""But I've had chances to leave."" he mumbled nervously. 
""Speak up!"" she shrieked.
""I-, I've had chances to go else where!"" he bellowed.
""Toronto, Chicago, I'm trying to make this work!""
Mrs.Luongo's eyes flared, she slowly prowled over to her husband.
""I know baby, i know."" Her tone had become pouty. Gina caressed her husband's face into her chest, steering his eyes up into hers. 
""But unless you ever want to see me, or your kids again.""
She paused briefly, staring. 
""You'll get that excuse of a fucking manager to trade you to, Florida!!!!!""
Roberto drew back in fear, his heart beat steadily against his chest.
Gina released her grip of his head, and wiped her hands on the sides of her dress. 
""I'm going shopping, then to the beach."" Gina stormed towards the door and looked back. 
""Figure it out, *finocchio*!"" The door slammed shut with a bang.
Roberto slicked his hair back into place and slowly exhaled. 
He looked over at his mantle centerfold. His gold medal hung in place, sending glimmers of light around the room.
His eyes moved to the Canucks flag, hanging above the mantle on the wall. 
Roberto cracked a half smile, then slowly turned his head to the window.
Palms trees dotted the beach view, seagulls hung gracefully in the sky.

Roberto had some thinking to do.",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,1373179045.0,,2007a,True,t3_1hsbuq,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/1hsbuq/we_all_know_what_the_root_of_the_problem_is/,

I'm from the Bay Area and am a die-hard Sharks fan. Any time anyone mentions the Canucks I usually have nothing nice to say as you guys have eliminated us from the play-offs and are just one of those teams that I love to hate.

When my sister told me that her and her friend were going to the Sharks game IN Vancouver that took place yesterday I told her to be careful and not get in to any shit. She and I were sending texts throughout the game (fucking great game by the way!) and she had absolutely nothing bad to say about the arena or its fans. In fact, she said the fans sitting around her were extremely pleasant and nice.


Thank you Canucks fans, for not only do we have great games when we play but just treating other teams fans, even Sharks fans, with respect. I'll buy all of you guys a round next time you're in town!",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,,,True,t3_orppt,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/orppt/a_big_thank_you_from_a_sharks_fan/,

It broke my heart that the city seemed to turn on him and demand he got railroaded out of town. Truth be told, it was never Luongo's fault when the times were bad, it takes a whole team to fail, and thats something a lot of lesser fans don't realize. But he's such a humble guy he shouldered the blame more times then he should. Like that fateful game 7 in 2011 when the Bruins blew 4 goals past him and the Canucks couldn't even score one. If he had even just let in one that night, they still would've lost.

The problem has never been Luongo, its the team in front of him. Tortorella thinly veiled this problem when he said the WHOLE team will start taking accountability with him at the helm. Too many times have people called for Luongo's head while the Sedins got off scott-free while being virtually non-existant and too soft in the play offs.

In New Jersey, where Schneider will soon take the torch from the league's greatest goalie that town and the Devil's fans stood faithfully by Marty for his whole career, through the good times and the bad. Its about time fans here in Vancouver got behind and supported a goalie that is here to stay, for the rest of his career, through the thick and thin. Not another descent into mediocrity by milling through new goalies every 5 to 7 years.

Luongo is just what the doctor ordered when it comes to what Tortorella wants in his team, he has the experience and the leadership to help steer the team in a new direction with the younger guys that are inevitably coming. In an age where goalies are almost 40 years old and still able to compete at a championship caliber I'll make the bet that Luongo will still be able to maintain top form when he's also in his late 30s. Brodeur proved it last season by taking the Devils all the way to the cup, and Tim Thomas proved it the year before against the Canucks, both men were at least past 38 when they achieved this.

The whole city and the rest of the Canucks fans better heed this: Its time you got behind Luongo and looked at him like a permanent fixture on the team until he's old enough to move on to other things. He's a great guy, a great leader and very charismatic.

Plus next spring when he's named the starter for team Canada in Sochi, the whole city will swell with patriotic pride again knowing Luongo is STILL a Canuck.

Every year teams beat seemingly insurmountable odds, and if they can, why can't we? 

As long as our guys don't give up, we have a chance at winning. I don't need to remind you guys that Chicago came back last year and forced game 7 overtime, and I don't need to remind you of Philadelphia 2 years ago coming back against Boston. This team is good enough to go out there and get the job done, don't lose faith. 

If they come out strong and get the win tomorrow night, we are still in it. We will have home ice advantage for game 5, and you know what? We win that, and we are just 1 win away from tying this thing. Then we have home ice advantage for game 7. Teams win 4 games in a row all the time, and so will we.

Vancouver Canucks

**Player**
	 	
- Injury and date sustained	

- Status/Updated	Notes

**David Booth**	 LW	 

*  Ankle	Out for the remainder of the regular season - 3/23/13	 
*  Booth will miss the remainder of the regular season after having surgery on his injured ankle. He could return during the playoffs, depending on how far the Canucks advance.


**Manny Malhotra**	 C	
 
*  Eye	out for season - 2/15/13	
*  Malhotra has been placed in the injured reserve due to a re-occurrence of visual symptoms stemming from the career-threatening eye injury he suffered last season. Out of concern for his on-ice safety and long-term health, he will miss the remainder of the season.

**Chris Tanev**	 D	 

*  Leg 	D2D- 4/6/13	 
*  AV is aparently giving Tanev a couple days off, due to the leg injury he sustained against the flames.

Looks like Luongo might be injured, so I'll make sure to update this post once I find out.

**My notes:**

*updated 08/04/13*

* *d2d - day to day*

So I made a new YouTube account specific to Canucks only games. I will be uploading every single Canucks game that occurs in 2013. If the Canucks make the Playoffs, I will upload them too. The complete upload will be available either the same day, the day after, or 2 days at max. I will constantly update the thread after I successfully upload each game. I hope you enjoy the ride!

Listen, I think we all need to cut this bullshit out. I know the vast majority of you are respectful, intelligent hockey fans who are focused on good quality discussion of the game. Recently I've seen a number of people (mostly Canucks fans) come to our subreddit and are either trolling the hell out of us, or presenting poisonous anti-Bruins comments that hold no legitimacy and aren't backed up by facts. I feel like the hatred that we reciprocate between each other and our teams is hurting the r/hockey community as a whole because fans of different teams come in and see the same general hating comments directed at both sides of our rivalry. This is just me going on a rant here, but I'm just looking for a little confirmation from r/canucks that you guys know we (the true Bruins fans that belong in r/BostonBruins) maintain a distinct level of respect for you guys and your team despite our differences. What we do in our respective subreddits should be our own goddamn business. I'm not sure how much you guys have experienced Bruins fans coming here and trash-talking your team, but I want to apologize for any of it and make sure you guys know that the few who are doing that do not represent the Bruins community as we would like them to. I think we should keep the discussions between our two fan bases in r/hockey and for the sake of just getting along we should disregard each others subreddits. There's just way too much venom in every conversation between us these days and its a cancer that needs to stop/slow significantly. Everyone who reads this and understands what I'm getting at probably isn't part of the problem anyway, I just think we need to stop it with the ignorance.

**TL;DR**: We should keep to ourselves unless we are in r/hockey, and if that's the case the general conversation deserves to be much more civil.

I'm also excited that I can probably end up going to Seattle for a weekend, watch a game, stay the night, and still come out spending less money than if I were to get good seats at Rogers Arena.

1307638348.0,51,self.canucks,hvmy4,The time I sharpened Kirk McLean's skates and then robbed him.,,59,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/hvmy4/the_time_i_sharpened_kirk_mcleans_skates_and_then/,"Hopefully you guys get as much of a kick out of this story as I did when it happened.

So, a little over three years ago I was 18 years old, going to SFU and renting from family in Kits (I later found out that there are a few ex-Canucks in the area). To help pay for school and expenses, I was working at a small sports shop on Broadway, G-Max Sports, maybe you've heard of it. Anyways, the owner was a pretty bulky guy who used to play for the Thunderbirds back in the day and would routinely head over to UBC to get games in with the other alums. 

So, one day, I'm just minding my business, sharpening skate after skate in the back, when the honing stone happens to slip. Sliced thumb, blood, bandage, good to go. I carry on with the skates as a customer walks in with a pair of his own. He starts chatting up Mike (the owner) and I can't shake the feeling that I've seen him somewhere before. He comes over to the back, comments on the bloody bandage, chats for a few seconds, hands me his skates and takes off. I think nothing of it at the time, but when I finish all the sharpening work Mike comes over to me.

""Do you know who that was?"" he said.

""Uhhh, not really."" I still couldn't place his face.

""That was Kirk McLean.""

""....wut?""

I had only ever seen a few pictures of him without his mask and I was only about 4 or 5 when they made their run in the '94 playoffs, so this realization hit me like a freight train and I got a bit light headed, haha. Apparently Mike and Kirk both went out to play with the UBC alumni every once in a while and he came to G-Max because Mike gave him a free (and quality, if I do say so myself) sharpening.

Fast forward a month or so, Kirk has come in one or two more times and every time I just stood in the back, sharpening skates, trying to simultaneously keep all my fingers and not look awestruck while glancing over between passes. One night, about half an hour before closing, Mike says the *really* old timer alumni are missing one of their goalies and he asks if I wanted to fill in. I hadn't strapped on the pads in almost a year but I figured that they might as well get some use since I had brought them to Vancouver with the intention of playing. He gives me the time and location and I head home under the impression that I'll be playing against some geriatrics.

I get dropped off at around 8 pm and walk in to the arena, toting my monstrous goalie bag. Mike greets me on the walkway above one of the rinks and shows me which dressing room I'm going to. He's still a relatively young guy (maybe 41, 42, he's Asian, so it's hard to tell) and he lets me know that he'll be playing with the younger alumni. I'm kind of bummed, since he was the only person I knew there and I was about to get suited up in a dressing room full of hard-as-fuck guys in their 60s and 70s, but whatever, at least I'm getting on the ice.

I guess I was a bit early, because when I walked into the dressing room it was a bit quiet and there weren't many guys yet. Just a few clothed white-haired old dudes, one naked white-haired old dude, and, in the back corner of the room, one Kirk Alan McLean. Captain Kirk is getting suited up (as a skater, not a goalie, mind you) to play on the same sheet of ice as me. Needless to say, I was beside myself. Not wanting to seem like an overeager superfan, I just sit my ass down in a spot the furthest possible distance from him and start getting ready.

After what seemed like ages of just making small talk with randoms while getting dressed (""Not bad"" ""Going to school for engineering"" ""SFU"" ""it's alright""), we finally hit the ice. I figure I have it made in the shade because most of these guys looked like they had trouble walking, so keeping pucks out of the net should be a breeze. Lordy, was I wrong, those guys could rocket the puck, put on a snipe show and still had the legs to motor down the ice. Meanwhile I'm rusty as all hell and my cardio is the shits. Needless to say, the score got run up on myself (rusty) and the other guy (old) and we decide to just stick to our own nets when teams switched sides. This is what allowed me to face shots from Kirk, which, given that he's known for being a goalie, didn't go as well as I would have hoped. He sniped the top corner, deked the pants off me and set up some pretty good goals, but the only shot I really remember well was when he was stationed in front of the net, waiting for a pass.

I'm pretty active with my stick when I'm in net. I like to cut off passes, poke check, etc. and I'm usually pretty good at it. So when I see one guy swing around the boards towards the back of the net while looking out front, I can tell what he was going to do and block the path with my stick. He easily counters this with a perfect saucer pass that floats just over my blade....shit. So, as quick as I can, I spin out to face the shooter, but my attempt to block the pass put me in an awkward position. I haphazardly reel in my stick, drop down and, just as the guy in front shoots the puck to what he thinks is a wide open top, left corner, I throw out my blocker and rob him blind. Looking up, I see that it's Kirk himself, and hear a few of the guys go ""ohhhhh!""

I never really amounted to much in my hockey-playing days, hell, the final score in that game was up near the 20s for both teams, but I'll never forget the night that I made a huge save on Kirk McLean.

1334268863.0,52,self.canucks,s6ws0,Some Thoughts About Game 1,Yensuji,56,4,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/s6ws0/some_thoughts_about_game_1/,"I feel the need to ventilate some personal feelings about yesterday's valiant (or lack thereof) effort against the L.A. Kings. As much as I feel this will be downvoted into oblivion, I just wanted to post and  see if I'm just thinking too much, or if my concerns are much more widespread than I thought.

Yesterday's game. First game of the 2012 Stanley Cup Playoffs between the L.A. Kings and Vancouver Canucks. The first of a widely anticipated playoff run for Vancouver, one that shows promise and hopes of pulling through Operation 16-W. The anticipation was at a pinnacle level, the pressure insurmountable. And yet, the Canucks played one of the worst playoff games I've seen in a while.

* Luongo was solid. In fact, he was the only reason the Kings only potted 3 (and the empty net goal). I'd argue he was one of the only Canucks that played well last night.

* The amount of penalties the Canucks took killed off any momentum we had going. It's miraculous they even got 2 against Jonathan Quick - perhaps a testament to the quality of the team that they can sometimes pull off victories despite being dominated throughout the game. That wasn't the case last night.

* The ridiculous amount of diving was a joke. An absolute joke. We're known as a team with that tendency throughout the regular season, and yet that behaviour increased tenfold in just the first game of the post-season. I'm calling out the usual suspects in the likes of Kesler, Burrows, and Henrik for last night's ridiculous diving. Given how much the team has struggled on the PP, it's hard to imagine the point of trying to get a man advantage nowadays. You might as well play 5-on-5 and try to grind out some goals.

* The Kings forced the Canucks into playing their style of game. Aggressive. Hard-hitting. Gritty. The Canucks can't play like that. The team isn't built like that. Yet the game strategy, going into last night, was clearly get aggressive, and hit anyone in your way. How that turned out was evidently shown by the amount of penalties taken by the Canucks in the game. With the team forced into a certain play-style, the Kings were able to turn the tables against us and dominate the entire game. Luongo saved our asses, especially early on. For the Canucks to succeed, they need to force the Kings into the Canucks game style. Cycling the puck, and pouncing on all offensive opportunities. Getting traffic in front is one thing, but when you take extremely weak, low wrist shots with 5 people between you and the goalie, you're not going to score. Go back to the way we're used to playing, and surely Vancouver can turn things around.

That's really all my thoughts about the first game. It was just a terribly played game by the Canucks, especially in the face of the amount of pressure our team has. The only positive I drew out of that is that Luongo took the pressure well, and kept the score close when the team in front of him played some careless hockey. I'm confident the team can turn things around, but it better be darn soon, or else the Kings might run away with the steal of the 1st round this year.

It does not mean that it is time for a fire sale however.

This subreddit right now is ridiculous with all of the ""trade Sedins/Burrows/Kesler/Bieksa"" talk. Will there be changes in the offseason? Yes. Most likely AV is fired. I don't think Gillis will be, but its in the realm of possibility. Guys who have been useless (cough Raymond) are gone. Those guys will be replaced, and these new players and a new coaching system can rejuvinate this team, and calling for trades involving the faces of the franchise is ridiculous. The Sedins not only represent the team, but they represent Vancouver as well. They cannot be traded, and they should not be traded, and the fickleness of our fanbase is astounding calling for their heads. 

Its normal to be frustrated, I am straight up pissed right now, but everyone needs to calm the fuck down and stop turning on our star players the moment we lose.

It'd be awesome if we could all reach out to our fellow fans in Vancouver, and the Great B.C. area and let them know that all those going to the game should do the standup thing and bring out the applause for both Cody and Sulzer. The trades are still fresh on everyone's minds and regardless of some of the ways the media is spinning this both of them played their best when they were on this team. 

It's of special note that it'll be a big game between two teams that rarely play one another, during a HNIC broadcast, and with a lot of media and fans watching out of curiosity over the whole 'big trade' from Monday. It would be fantastic if we should our true colours, showed support, and stepped up the class to get rid of the negative image the media and opposition teams from the East seem to sling on us. 

I know I'm most likely preaching to the choir as pretty well every Canuck fan on this board is super awesome, but if you could post something similar to your Facebook feeds, Twitter, or just let a buddy or acquaintance know if you hear they are going to the game, that'd be awesome.

**Team History**

Notable Player #1: **Trevor Linden**, RW/C, played sixteen seasons with the Canucks (a franchise high), was team captain 1991-1997, and is arguably the most beloved player in the history of the franchise, for everything from his style of play, his ongoing community involvement, and his aw-shucks good looks. He also holds the #4 spot on the franchise scoring leaders ranking and his #16 was retired by the franchise in 2008.

Notable Player #2: **Stan Smyl**, RW, played his entire career in Vancouver and is the longest tenured captain in franchise history, having held the post for eight years (1982-90). At the time of his retirement he held the franchise record in every major statistical category, and his #12 was raised to the rafters in 1991. Like Linden, Smyl stayed active in the Vancouver community after retirement and remains a beloved figure.

Notable Player #3: **Markus Naslund**, LW, was traded from the Penguins to the Canucks prior to the 1996 trade deadline for Alek Stojanov, which to this day is one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history. He quickly became an impact player and one-third of the very effective ""West Coast Express"" line alongside Todd Bertuzzi and Brendan Morrison, and in 2000 was named captain. His #19 was retired in 2010.

Notable Player #4: **Pavel Bure**, RW, was an electrifying and controversial player in his time with the Canucks, balancing speed and skill with an at times difficult personality. Though he left the team on bad terms after holding out on the last year of his contract until a trade was made with the Florida Panthers, his #10 is expected to be retired by the Canucks in the coming season.

Notable Player #5: **Kirk McLean**, G, was, prior to the acquisition of Roberto Luongo, the hands-down best goaltender in franchise history and the yardstick by which every other Canucks goaltender was measured and found wanting. He backstopped the team for ten years (1987-1998) and in 2010 was inducted into the Canucks' ""Ring of Honour"".

*Honourable Mentions: Thomas Gradin, Tony Tanti, Todd Bertuzzi*

**History**

The Vancouver Canucks entered the NHL as an expansion team in the 1970-71 season. They played in the Pacific Coliseum (presently home to the WHL’s Vancouver Giants) and wore the now familiar blue and green, the provincial colours of British Columbia.

The team struggled initially, making the playoffs only a handful of times in their first decade. The silver lining to their struggles is that the years of losing led to the adoption of some of the most gloriously hideous uniforms ever to grace an ice sheet: the 1978-1984 Flying V uniform. New owner Frank Griffiths felt that the Canucks’ image needed a shake up, and spent $100 000 hiring a US communications firm who deemed the blue and green sweaters too tranquil and passive. The red-orange, mustard and black uniforms were designed for maximum aggression and energy, and aggressive they were; sports writer Jim Taylor wrote that the Canucks were “No. 15 in the standings and No. 1 on your retinas”.

Despite being universally reviled and objectively appalling, the Flying V became popular with fans when the Canucks made it to the Stanley Cup final versus the dominant New York Islanders. Unfortunately, the 1982 cup final was a bright spark in another largely mediocre decade. Notable events included the trading of Cam Neely for beans (1986), the installation of Pat Quinn as General Manager (1987), and the drafting of Trevor Linden (1988) and Pavel Bure (1989).

The nineties brought a turn for the better, featuring a reduction in the eye-searing uniform horror with the re-introduction of home whites, a Calder Trophy for Bure in 1992, and a slightly flukey Stanley Cup run in 1994. The series was intense and mismatched, pitting the Canucks against the New York Rangers; the Canucks won Game 1 in overtime largely due to a virtuosic 52-save performance by Kirk McLean, lost three in a row, and then won Games 5 &amp; 6, giving captain Trevor Linden the chance to earn his sainthood in the eyes of Canucks fans by scoring two goals, one on a shorthanded breakaway, in a 3-2 loss. Trev had broken ribs during the game and according to teammates, screamed so loud in the trainer's room while receiving injections that they could hear him in the dressing room, but he kept a brave face when he returned and refused to acknowledge the injury. The loss was emotional and resulted in the city's first Stanley Cup riot.

The team moved from the Pacific Coliseum to the new General Motors Place (now Rogers Arena) following the lockout-shortened 1995 season. The late ‘90s ushered in some big names: Alexander Mogilny, acquired from Buffalo in 1995, Naslund from Pittsburgh later that season, and the free agent signing of Mark Messier in 1997 after negotiations failed with Wayne Gretzky the previous summer (just picture that for a minute).

The Canucks flat out blew in the seasons following their cup run, and in the first weeks of the 1997-98 season Pat Quinn was fired as GM. Coach Tom Renney was fired soon thereafter and replaced by Mike Keenan, whose appointment led to rapid changes in the roster after he was made de facto General Manager two months into his tenure. Most notably, Keenan traded Trevor Linden, who had at the beginning of the season resigned his captaincy for Messier, to the New York Islanders in exchange for Todd Bertuzzi and Brian McCabe. While the trade was extremely unpopular given Linden’s fan-favourite status and the public personal issues between him and Keenan, Bertuzzi became a huge part of the Canucks’ success in the next decade and McCabe was more indirectly influential as part of a later trade. Brian Burke was hired as GM in the summer of 1998 and Keenan was fired midway through the 1998-99 season and replaced by Marc Crawford. Meanwhile, Pavel Bure was in the midst of his contract holdout and in January of 1999 was traded to the Florida Panthers in a seven player trade that included Ed Jovanovski. The team finished last in the Conference and received the 4th overall pick, which Brian Burke used (along with the aforementioned McCabe and a whole lot of other funky maneuvring) to acquire the 2nd and 3rd overall picks, with which he selected Henrik and Daniel Sedin.

The new millenium was good to the Canucks, beginning with the trade of Mogilny to the Devils for Denis Pederson and Brendan Morrison. B-Mo, Bertuzzi, and Naslund found some stellar chemistry and became the West Coast Express line. In 2002, Burke traded with the Capitals to bring Linden back to Vancouver.

In the 2003 playoffs the Canucks won their first playoff series in 8 years, and things were looking up. Then, in 2004, Bertuzzi grabbed Steve Moore of the Avalanche from behind and punched him in the the head in retaliation for a hit Moore had made on Naslund in a prior game. Moore suffered a broken neck and a concussion from a combination of the punch, hitting the ice, and Bertuzzi landing on top of him. Bertuzzi was suspended for the rest of the season and postseason. That summer, Brian Burke was not renewed as GM and Dave Nonis was hired to replace him.

After the lockout, the Canucks were expected to do well under the new rule changes, but underperformed, leading to the firing of Coach Crawford and the hiring of Alain Vigneault. Shortly thereafter, Bertuzzi was traded to the Panthers in exchange for Roberto Luongo. The personnel changes were highly successful, and Luongo was nominated for the Hart and the Vezina, but the Canucks lost in the second round of the playoffs to the Stanley Cup-winning Anaheim Ducks, which became something of a trend; the Canucks would lose to the Cup winners 4 out of 6 times between 2007 and 2012. 2008 marked the end of the Naslund era, as he left for New York due in part to issues with Vigneault’s coaching philosophy, and the team missed the playoffs, resulting in Dave Nonis’ firing and the hiring of Mike Gillis to replace him as GM. Luongo was named captain, making him the first goalie captain since 1947. He relinquished his captaincy two years later to Henrik Sedin, who in 2010 had a career year and won both the Art Ross and Hart Trophies.

2011, despite how it ended, may go down in history as the Canucks’ best season of all time. They won the Presidents’ Trophy with a franchise record-setting 54 wins and 117 points, and Daniel Sedin, Ryan Kesler, and Roberto Luongo all had career years, winning the Art Ross, Selke, and Jennings respectively. In the postseason, the Canucks met the Chicago Blackhawks for the third time in three years, and finally defeated them with an overtime goal from Alex Burrows which led to the majestic call, “They slayed the dragon!” Ryan Kesler went on to near-singlehandedly defeat the Nashville Predators, with points in 11 of the 14 goals the Canucks scored in that series. Henrik Sedin then took the lead against the Sharks, scoring 12 points in the 5 game series. The scoring dried up in the final versus Boston, however, as the Canucks scored only 8 goals in 7 games and lost in a 4-0 shut out on home ice. We all know what happened after.

The 2011-12 and shortened 2013 seasons were heavy with pressure to repeat 2010-11’s glories, and while they achieved a second Presidents’ Trophy win in 2012 and continued their Northwest Division dominance in 2013, both seasons were fraught with controversy over the #1 goaltending position and ended with disappointing first round playoff exists, resulting in 2013 in the firing of Alain Vigneault and the surprising trade of Cory Schneider to the Devils in exchange for their 9th overall selection in the 2013 draft, with which the Canucks selected Bo Horvat.

**Current Team**

Top player #1 - **Henrik Sedin**, C, is the current team captain and franchise leading scorer with 792 points. He has the power to make any given dude look like an NHL player, and any given NHL player look like a wizard.

Top player #2 - **Daniel Sedin**, LW, is second only to his brother in franchise points, with 758. He is the triggerman to Henrik’s set-up man, and they may be psychic and/or speak some kind of dolphin language.

Top player #3 - **Ryan Kesler**, C, is, when healthy, one of the best two-way forwards in the league, and a key piece of the Canucks’ success in his tenure with the team, particularly in his special teams roles.

Top player #4 - **Dan Hamhuis**, D, is the unsung hero of the team, leading the blueline in points last season with 24. Although not known for a dynamic offensive game, he's a very intelligent player on both ends of the rink and can always be relied on for a sweet outlet pass or a killer hip check.

Top player #5 - **Roberto Luongo**, G, is a supremely talented goaltender who had a massive hand in turning around the tire fire that was Vancouver’s goalie situation post Kirk McLean. His relationship with the Vancouver media and fanbase has been something of a rollercoaster, but he has been consistently elite in his time with the Canucks, and will likely remain so for some time. Also, he’s hilarious on Twitter.

*Honorable Mention(s): Dan Hamhuis, Alex Edler, Alex Burrows*

**This Season**

* The Canucks lack forward depth, and appear to intend to fill out the roster with rookies. This could go badly, particularly in the event of injuries.

* The defence, however, might be the most stable it’s been in years, assuming Chris Tanev, RFA, is signed.

* And the goaltending drama is finally sorted out, albeit not the way most of us expected. Luongo will be backed up by one or a combination of Eddie Lack and Joacim Eriksson.

* Basically, this will be interesting.

**Rivals**

Biggest Rival - **Chicago Blackhawks**: Having faced each other in the playoffs three years in a row (2009-2011), it’s no surprise that these two teams, and fanbases, don’t like each other. Throw in a few bad hits (Torres on Seabrook in 2011, Keith on Daniel Sedin in 2012) and baby, you’ve got a rivalry going.

Rival #2 - **Boston Bruins**: The hate is so strong with this one that it was created not with repeated playoff series, but with eight games in three years. Eight. In those eight games, Burrows bit Bergeron, Rome concussed Horton with a late high hit, Boychuk broke Raymond’s back by driving him into the boards awkwardly, Marchand punched Daniel Sedin in the face six times and concussed Sami Salo with a low hit, and a lot of insults of varying validity were flung by fans (and presumably players). These kinds of things stick with a hockey fan.

Rival #3 - **Calgary Flames**: This one is a hate so long-standing it’s kind of difficult to even name any specific incidents that created it. Perhaps Vancouverites have always hated Calgarians, and vice versa, and it doesn’t even matter if one of their teams has been mediocre for years and mostly functioned as a place for Mason Raymond to pad out his scoring stats. Who knows.

Rival #4 - **San Jose Sharks**: This one is fresh, and can basically be summed up by the fact that, as a fanbase, we are terrible at losing. We hate it. It makes us angrycry and no one likes an angrycrier. Even worse is a sweep, because then those Bruins fans we’ve grown to hate make fun of our broom flair. Not cool.

*Honorable Mention(s): Los Angeles Kings, Edmonton Oilers*

Other Notes:

This has nothing to do with rivalry, really, except in the distant way we consider the New York Rangers rivals for making us burn down our city that one time, but **MARK MESSIER IS GARBAGE**. He is human tennis elbow, he is the pizza burn on the roof of the world's mouth, he is the opposite of Batman.

He is the *AT&amp;T of people*.

Mark Messier not only stole our Stanley Cup in 1994 when he *already had so many*, but then he had the gall to sign with the Canucks in 1997. First, he took the captaincy from Trevor Linden, who is perfect in every manner. Then he took Wayne Maki's #11 which was unofficially retired in 1974 when Maki *died of brain cancer*. And then, just to put a bow on it, he proceeded to have the worst season of his career since 1979. And the team, which previously seemed to be one Mark Messier away from having it all, finished dead last in the division. A decade later he sued the team and received a $6 million settlement in further payment for three lousy seasons.

Messier is the worst.

Everyone remember what happened the last time we got ventilated by the hawks? The boys had a meeting, got their shit together and went on an absolute tear and picked up points in like 17 straight games. This, in the long run, could be a good thing. Allow the guys a chance to see that there are no easy games and no nights off in the playoffs. 

Come Thursday, the crowd will be behind them all the way and we can close out these tools for good. The added revenue of another home game should make the owners happy as well. 

I doubt any of you on this subreddit are fare weather fans but I have definitely already seen a few negative comments made regarding past demons and there are a lot of here we go agains. So, for anyone who wants to jump off the wagon you can go right ahead. But remember, you can fuck right off when we win our first Stanley Cup come June. To my fellow devoted brothers I salute you. We shall drink the tears of the Blackhawks come Thursday.
Sorry for the long rant but I felt it needed to be done after tonights less than stellar performance.

## Game Notes:

* For the second year in a row - and just the second time in head coach Alain Vigneault's tenure as Canucks bench boss - Vancouver dropped their playoff opener on Wednesday falling 3-1 to the Sharks.

* Vancouver has won just one of their last eight playoff games dating back to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. They've also lost their last five straight home playoff games dating back to Game 7 of that Cup Final series.

* The Canucks have won just three of 12 all-time best-of-seven playoff series when losing the opening game. The last time they managed to feat was in their first round series against the Blues in 2003 when they dropped the series opener and then built a 3-1 series deficit before bouncing back and winning in seven games.

* For the second straight year – and the fourth time in their last five playoff series – the Sharks have jumped out to a 1-0 series lead. That advantage didn't do them much good last year however as, after winning their series opener against the Blues a year ago, they dropped the next four games in a row to lose that series.

* The Sharks have won nine of 14 all-time series where in which they've won the opening game.

* The Canucks shuffled their forward lines at practice yesterday but as far as actual changes to the lineup goes all is expected to remain status quo both up front, on the back end, and between the pipes. G Cory Schneider did not practice yesterday so he will likely be scratched again meaning G Roberto Luongo will get the start and G Joe Cannata will serve as the back up.

* The Sharks did not shed much light on the statuses of injured forwards Martin Havlat and Scott Gomez following their practice yesterday. Gomez was a somewhat surprise scratch for Game 1 with an undisclosed injury while Havlat left Game 1 after playing just 3:16 with a lower body injury. The Sharks are already without D Jason Demers.

* Dating back to the regular season, in their last seven outings, the Canucks have been out-scored by a combined 15-1 in third periods.

* The Canucks come into tonight's contest having surrendered power play goals in three straight games dating back to the regular season. This is tied for their longest streak of consecutive games with a power play goal surrendered. They began the regular season giving up a power play goal in each of their first three games.

* Canucks D Kevin Bieksa's goal in Game 1 was his 10th career playoff goal – a goal that moved him into sole possession of first place on the franchise's all-time goals list among defenseman. He had come into these playoffs in a six-way tie with Jyrki Lumme, Mattias Ohlund, Dave Babych, Sami Salo and Ed Jovanovski on the franchise all-time list.",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,1367626545.0,,2007b,True,t3_1dmjkc,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/1dmjkc/game_thread_san_jose_sharks_10_at_vancouver/,

However, there were three areas in which I saw noticeable improvement:

1.  Puck Battles:  We won the majority of the puck battles tonight by outmanning our opposition on the boards and simply being stronger on the puck.  This led to a much better cycle game, particularly for the top line, and far fewer defensive zone turnovers.

2.  Defensive-zone decisions:  The Canucks did a great job tonight of reading the play in the defensive zone.  There have been too many times in the past few games where we take possession in the defensive end and then try to force the puck through a high traffic area, resulting in a turnover.  Tonight, the Canucks made better decisions in finding outlets.  This was definitely helped along by better defensive-zone support and more patience from the defensemen.

3.  The Sedins:  For the first time this season, I felt like our top line was our best line on the ice.  Kassian's dominance aside, the Sedins had being struggling prior to tonight, especially 5-on-5 and in the defensive zone.  Against the Avs, however, the Sedins were able to get their cycle game going and spent the majority of the time in the offensive end, thus creating scoring chances, and more importantly, keeping the puck 200 feet from Luongo.


I feel as if this was our strongest game of the season yet, and it looks like a return to the form of the past few seasons after a shaky first week.  As a final note, it was great to see Garrison finally get rewarded for what I think has been a strong start for him and completely undeserving of the criticism.",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,,1992,True,t3_17m5r2,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/17m5r2/improvements_tonight_against_the_avs/,

What were the 'clutch' goals this playoffs for the Canucks?

1.  Burrows in OT eliminating the Hawks in Game 7
2.  Kesler scoring with seconds left to send it to OT in Game 5 against the Sharks
3.  Bieksa's odd bounce in 2OT to win that game and eliminate the Sharks.
4.  Burrows scores off the face-off in OT in Game 2 of the Final.

Seems like a toss up.

But, let me remind you...  Not only did Burrows score 2 of those 4 goals - but he was on the ice and made important plays on the other two goals as well!

But, I hear everyone say that Kesler (or the Sedins or Luongo) are more dominant.  Let's just see:

Kesler:  19pts, +3

Dan:  18pts, -5

Hank:  21pts, -6

***Burrows***:  17pts, +4 

Oh, and don't forget that Burrows ***doesn't play the powerplay*** to get easy points like the others do...  More than half Kesler/Sedins' goals came on the power-play - whereas, only one Burrows goal was...

Burrows is the playoff MVP this year (not that they'd ever let him win the Conn Smythe, but he deserves it)!",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,,,True,t3_hyle5,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/hyle5/if_the_canucks_win_the_cup_tonight/,

Roy, Hansen and Higgins had chemistry from their first shift to their last

Lappy andKassian were hitting people here and there, and Zack scored!

Hank was winning faceoffs, and a Sedin scored (Hank).

Cory was solid, great positionally, and clutch.

4th line was doing exactly was a 4th line needs to do: Control the puck deep, take the body, and not screw up.

Defence was solid.

Powerplay looked great.

Also:

Hank on the PK? What? He did well though, needs a bit more practice at it, but he did well.

Derek Roy makes such a difference to our team, its been great. Hes taken off so much pressure from the entire team, each player has had a little monkey taken off their back (some bigger than others), I'm excited to see our lineup with everyone back in it.

Jason Garrison was limping off the ice during the Kassian goal, hopefully he isnt hurt, but we'll all have to hold our thumbs that he doesnt join this [list](http://canucks.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=39938).

## Game Notes:

* The Canucks didn't exactly end their regular season on a high note dropping a 7-2 decision in Edmonton on Saturday night. They closed out their regular season losing back-to-back games. They have not lost more than two in a row since a four-game winless skid from March 3 to 10.

* The Sharks, like the Canucks, also dropped their last two games to end the regular season. Their 3-2 loss to the Kings in their season finale is what got them this series against the Canucks. Had they won, they would have earned themselves a date with the St. Louis Blues instead.

* The Sharks dominated the Canucks in the season series winning all three head-to-head meetings. The closest the Canucks came to knocking off the Sharks was a 3-2 shootout loss on home ice back on March 5.

* In 185 minutes of hockey played between the Canucks and Sharks this season, the Sharks played with a lead for 123:29. The Canucks did not have a single lead at any point in their three-game season series.

* The Canucks had never lost their opening game of the playoffs under head coach Alain Vigneault until last year when they fell 4-2 to the Kings last year in their playoff opener.

* Based on how the Canucks skated at practice the last two days, it appears the healthy scratches for Game 1 – in addition to all the recent AHL call-ups – will be F Steven Pinizzotto, F Tom Sestito, D Cam Barker, D Derek Joslin and D Keith Ballard.

* The Canucks are hoping that G Cory Schneider will be good to go for tonight's contest after sitting out the last two regular season games with an undisclosed injury. Schneider declared himself ready following yesterday's practice but head coach Alain Vigneault indicated the final decision would not be made until the morning of game day.

* Sharks workhorse G Antti Niemi, who started 43 of his team's 48 games this season, will be the starter tonight for San Jose and for the entirety of the series barring unforeseen circumstances. This will be the third time in four years that he will have met the Canucks in the post-season.

* It remains to be seen whether G Roberto Luongo will factor into this series but, if he does, he could be on his way towards setting yet another franchise playoff record. He enters this series sitting just two wins shy of tying first place on the franchise's all-time playoff wins list. Kirk McLean holds that record with 34 playoff wins in a Canucks uniform.

* This entire first round series will be broadcasted on TSN which is a good sign for the Canucks.

## Game Notes:

* The Vancouver Canucks are reeling and none of the changes -- from switching goalies to mixing lines -- has worked, putting them on the brink of another early exit and back into a goaltending controversy as they try to avoid being eliminated by a San Jose Sharks team that has never swept a Stanley Cup Playoff series.

* Only three teams in NHL history have come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a best-of-7 series, and after losing all six to San Jose this season, there's little to suggest the Canucks will add to that. But the Sharks, who almost blew a 3-0 lead before winning Game 7 against the Detroit Red Wings in 2011, will be wary.",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,1367967099.0,,2007b,True,t3_1dva3j,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/1dva3j/game_thread_vancouver_canucks_03_at_san_jose/,

## Game Notes:

* The Canucks are coming off a heartbreaking 3-2 overtime loss in Game 2 and now face a tremendous uphill climb if they hope to get back into this series and win it. The Canucks squandered a late 2-1 third period lead when Patrick Marleau evened the game with 56 seconds remaining in regulation before ex-Canuck Raffi Torres put the final dagger into their hearts with the OT winner 5:31 into the first extra session.

* Vancouver has lost three straight playoff games dating back to last year and has just one playoff win in their last nine post-season outings dating back to the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. They've also lost six straight playoff home games dating back to 2011.

* Canucks F Jordan Schroeder, along with injured D Chris Tanev and G Cory Schneider, were among those that traveled with the team to San Jose. Tanev is still in a walking boot so he's highly doubtful to play. However, there are some who feel that both Schroeder and Schneider could factor into the lineup as early as tonight although that won't be known at least until this morning at the earliest.

* The Sharks are hoping to welcome F Scott Gomez back into the lineup tonight. Gomez has not played since April 23 missing four games in total. The Sharks are still missing D Jason Demers while F Martin Havlat, who was injured in Game 1, is questionable.

* This is the fourth time in Canucks playoff history that they have begun a best-of-seven series with two straight losses. History is clearly not on Vancouver's side as they lost all four of those series and only once managed to avoid a sweep.

* This is the seventh time in Sharks playoff history that they have begun a best-of-seven with two straight wins and only the second time they've managed that feat when the series has started on the road. Out of the previous six times they have jumped out to a 2-0 series lead, they have only squandered that lead to lose a series once – that was back in their 2006 Western Conference Semi-Final series against the Cup-bound Oilers.

* During their run to the Stanley Cup in 2011, the Canucks won four of six games that needed overtime to settle. Since then, Vancouver has lost back-to-back playoff overtime games including Friday's Game 2.

* One of the few bright spots for the Canucks in Game 2 was F Ryan Kesler's two-goal performance which nearly carried Vancouver to victory. For Kesler, the goals snapped a 13-game playoff goal drought he had dating back all the way to Game 5 of the 2011 Western Conference Final against the Sharks.

VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) - The Vancouver Canucks will have a new second line Sunday when they attempt to stay alive in the Stanley Cup playoffs against the Los Angeles Kings.

Alex Burrows, Ryan Kesler and Max Lapierre - dubbed by one pundit as the Three Mouthketeers because of their outspoken ways on the ice - want their actions to speak louder than words in Game 5 of the Western Conference quarterfinal series.

""It's in the back of our minds,"" Kesler said. ""We have to keep our emotions in check and just play between the whistles. When all three of us do it, we're pretty effective. I've had years of practice (keeping quiet.) Sometimes it slips out, but I'm good at keeping my emotions in check.""

The Canucks, down 3-1 in the best-of-seven series, face another must-win situation after beating the Kings 3-1 in Los Angeles on Wednesday night. Vancouver, first overall in the NHL for the second straight season, is attempting to become the fourth team in Stanley Cup history - 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs, 1975 New York Islanders and 2010 Philadelphia Flyers - to rally from a 3-0 deficit.

""It's a little different,"" Burrows said about the new line combination. ""But at the same time, we're in a tough spot right now. We're trying to do whatever's best for the team. Whatever the coaching staff feels is right to do, we're more than willing to do it.""

Coach Alain Vigneault put Kesler, Burrows and Lapierre together in Game 4 after the Canucks trailed 1-0 after the first period.

Lapierre has served mainly as a third and fourth-liner since being acquired from the Anaheim Ducks at the trade deadline last season. But he has played more of a top-six forward role recently, subbing for Daniel Sedin on the top line while he was out with a concussion.

Before arriving in Vancouver, Lapierre had a reputation as a yapper. But Vigneault said the coaching staff has made it clear that he needs to zip his lip.

""He's been told to shut up and play,"" Vigneault said. ""That's what we expect of him.""

Kesler and Burrows played together early in their careers. However, Burrows was moved to the first line a few seasons ago after he played well alongside the Sedin twins.

""Playing with (Kesler) and watching him for the last seven, eight years, you know what he's good at,"" Burrows said. ""You know once the puck's through that neutral zone he wants to skate with it and he wants to make plays and shoot it. He's a great player, and we'll try to have one of our best games.""

Burrows said the line will try to take advantage of Kesler and Lapierre's speed and ability to get in on the forecheck.

""As a line, we can create offensively, played solid defensively and we're going to try to create some turnovers,"" Burrows said. ""The most important thing is to win the game.""

Lapierre said Burrows and Kesler bring a lot of skill to the unit. He will just try to create room for them by being physical so that they can put the puck in the net.

""We just have to keep things simple,"" Lapierre said. ""If we get on the forecheck and traffic in front of the goalie, I think we're going to create a lot of chances.""

The Canucks want to remain disciplined after getting into penalty trouble earlier in the series. As a result, said Lapierre, the club needs to keep the chirping to a minimum.

""Our role has not always been to go out there and talk,"" Lapierre said. ""Our role is to go out there and be physical and play the right way. That's all we're focusing on.""

The creation of the new unit comes as Vigneault continues to try to generate more offense. The playoffs are usually a time for unsung heroes, but the Canucks have not found any.

""At this point, we need guys to become key, clutch performers,"" Vigneault said. ""We got that from Schneids (goalie Cory Schneider) last game and got it from a couple of other guys. If we want our season to continue, we're going to need more guys doing that also.""

Vigneault confirmed Schneider will make his third straight start in goal.

but here at work, i found sabres fans who commiserated. then i found mets fans, ohio sports fans (that poor state has a ton of teams with jilted fan bases), and yes, even CHICAGO CUBS fans who have not only gone longer than we have without their ultimate prize, they've suffered more for it. hell, even the rangers went 54 years between cups.  and you know what i found? they not only sympathized with me, they actually laughed at how little i seemed to be suffering as a canuck fan. 

when you're feeling down and kicked while on the ground by other teams with better records, just remember...it could be so much worse. imagine what it's like to be an oiler fan whose team gave up the great one and for all four of their cups had to win the draft lottery almost a half dozen consecutive years to become a middle-of-the-pack team.

## Game Notes:

* Season series: The Canucks are making their first visit of the season to Pepsi Center. They blanked the Avalanche 3-0 in Vancouver on Jan. 30 and have won the last eight games between the teams.

* The Canucks are coming off a gritty 1-0 win at Los Angeles on Saturday -- a game they found a way to win despite icing an injury-depleted group of forwards. The Avalanche are glad to be back home after a 5-2 loss at Dallas on Saturday night, their ninth straight defeat away from the cozy confines of the Pepsi Center.",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,,2007b,True,t3_1ax3jg,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/1ax3jg/game_thread_vancouver_canucks_1696_at_colorado/,

This game really solidified that goaltending isn't truly the issue here. I'm all out of ideas. What do you guys think? I might be overreacting just because the wounds are fresh.

As sad as I was to see Cody go, and I am happy to have honoured him, but he is no longer a Canuck. Zack Kassian is a Canuck. Instead of focusing on what we lost lets look at what we gained.

1307487956.0,27,self.canucks,hu554,Why the Rome suspension is good for the Canucks,idspispopd,34,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/hu554/why_the_rome_suspension_is_good_for_the_canucks/,"First of all, I feel bad for Rome. He went out there and tried to make a big hit to get his team into the game but screwed up. It's true, it was a late, and therefore poor, hit. Let's keep something in mind though: ""late"" at the speed of the NHL is just under 1 second. Rome made a poor decision, but it was in the blink of an eye. Not as bad as a premeditated hit such as that of Eager on Daniel. Rome is not a dirty player, he just screwed up one second of his entire career.

Now, as for the team. Judging from [**what their captain is saying**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9UgPof3Z2jw&amp;feature=player_embedded), the Canuck players feel like Rome was not only suspended too long but that he shouldn't have been suspended at all. There is now an us-against-the-world mentality in the lockerroom. There is also a win-it-for-Rome angle. I would hope they didn't need any kind of a bump to wake them in this series, but they were just given a little extra motivation. Rome is loved in that lockerroom, remember the celebration when he [**scored his first goal as a Canuck**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpiNFQQTHlk)?

The second key thing is that the Bruins players have nothing to complain about anymore. True, they lost Horton for the series, but I can't imagine any rational person would say that Rome didn't get what he deserved. That's pretty much the maximum punishment you could expect. If playoff games are worth 2 regular season games when it comes to suspensions, Stanley Cup Final games must be worth 3 or 4 regular season games. 

The other thing is that there is now no player to target for retribution. We don't have to worry about Rome getting flattened by a cheap shot in this series anymore. The incident is behind us now and we can move on and play this series. Additionally, the Bruins players took game 3 to vent their frustration about Burrows' bite. After multiple finger-taunts and Lucic sucker-punching Burrows twice, I think they've finally got that out of their system. I think the refs have also had enough of the taunts and cheap shots and if that comes up again in this series they will be quick to hand out penalties.

Basically, the Rome suspension is the equivalent of hitting the reset button on the series. We know we're the better team, now we can just go out there and win this thing the way we planned to from the start!",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,,ryp,True,t3_hu554,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/hu554/why_the_rome_suspension_is_good_for_the_canucks/,

## Game Notes:

* The Canucks are looking to extend their win streak to a season-high four straight games. They are also looking to win consecutive games on the road for the first time this season.

* The Wild are coming off back-to-back regulation losses for the second time this season. They are looking to avoid equaling their longest winless streak at the season at three games.

* The Canucks won four of the six head-to-head meetings against the Wild in last year's season series but they lost two of the three games they played at the Xcel Energy Center and were out-scored by a combined 9-6 score there.

* Canucks G Cory Schneider will pick up his fifth start of the season tonight. He hasn't seen any game action since two Sundays ago in a 4-1 road loss to the Sharks.

* The Canucks last visit to the Xcel Energy Center on March 19 – also their last head-to-head meeting against the Wild – resulted in a 2-0 loss. Schneider was nearly perfect that night stopping 32 of 33 shots.

* Canucks G Roberto Luongo, who will be the back-up tonight, posted two shutouts in two starts against the Wild last season stopping all 61 shots he faced. Both of his starts came at Rogers Arena.

* Canucks F Daniel Sedin led all players in the season series last year with three goals and 10 points.

* Canucks F Jordan Schroeder, a native of Prior Lake, Minnesota, will play at the Xcel Energy Center for the first time as an NHLer tonight although he's had plenty of experience playing there in the past while with the University of Minnesota Golden Gophers.

* The Wild are expected to shake up their lines taking Heatley off the top unit alongside Parise and Koivu and moving rookie Charlie Coyle up in his spot. Heatley would drop down to play with Bouchard and Cullen.

* Ex-Ranger F Mike Rupp is expected to make his Wild debut tonight. He was acquired by the Wild on Monday in exchange for Darroll Powe and Nick Palmieri. Rupp is joining his sixth NHL team following previous stops in New Jersey, Phoenix, Columbus, Pittsburgh and New York.",,False,self,t5_2qrs7,False,,2007b,True,t3_183acr,http://www.reddit.com/r/canucks/comments/183acr/game_thread_vancouver_canucks_522_at_minnesota/,
