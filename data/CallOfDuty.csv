The Leaderboard hack back in MW2? Well finally, I can show you guys who the first person to hack call of duty on consoles was. It was me.

I exploited MW2 the first few days it came out, and now that my youtube account has been unbanned I can bring proof to my claims. My YouTube account possessed a valuable gaming history, I talked with Google and got it unbanned.

Most of you guys will not appreciate the content I am about to show you because you have been spoiled by the riches of Modded Lobbies, disagree with hacking/modding in general.. But understand, this was the history. The roots of the modded lobbies, this is how everything in call of duty modding started (for consoles), the reason for many changes in call of duty.

[Prestige hack released by Me](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwUXnSkpxY0)

My hacking buddy and I at the top of the leaderboards before anyone knew anything about the possibility of hacking it:
**[Uploaded on Nov 26, 2009](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsbAYCQ7UG8)**

Immidiately, I knew this was a threat. This knowledge that my friend and I had could destroy the game mechanics in a heartbeat if people found out. So what did I do?

I tried my best to contact infinity Ward, I sent them emails, tweets, everything I could to get in contact with them.

**[December 2  2009]
(http://i.imgur.com/Bs9fDl9.jpg)**

This tweet was to the community manager Robert Bowling, he was the last resort basically, and after being ignored by them, I figured, if they won't listen to me... they will listen to thousands of people.

After an exclusive release on a website I used to go to, I decided to make a public video and show everyone how to hack the leaderboards.

**[Uploaded on Dec 5, 2009]
(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgPqoCaPrbo)**

I also released the prestige hack shortly after:

**I decided to send Robert Bowling a message of the hacks:**

**What was the response from Activision?**
http://i.imgur.com/cTXs6i7.jpg

Too bad I knew what I was talking about, they released an update that patched the leaderboard hack, and it was mildly successful. But guess what? Like I previously told them, I knew other ways of exploiting this, and I proved it to them when I made this video after the patch:

**[Uploaded on Dec 21, 2009]

Activision's response? 

My youtube account was suspended due to Activision/Infinity Ward, and everything was lost. I had to create a new youtube account: http://www.youtube.com/nguhsx9

Not only was my account suspended. I was contacted by Activision attorneys several times, and I was threatened with a legal lawsuit for the ""damages caused"" I was only 16 when all of this happened, so I was pretty terrified at the idea of being in debt and possibly in prison. They gave me the opportunity to stop everything I was doing or I would get sued basically. 

After that everything went downhill and I had to stop modding/hacking. It was fun while it lasted, but when you get companies pissed, they will go out of their way to fuck up your life, no matter who you are or how old you are.

1361404984.0,64,self.CallOfDuty,18x48f,I've calculated how many Zombie rounds there are,yep2yel,80,16,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/18x48f/ive_calculated_how_many_zombie_rounds_there_are/,"*WARNING: MATH AHEAD*
We all know that technology is limited, no matter how advanced it seems. So, one question that I asked, that I'm surprised no one else has asked, is how many rounds of Zombies are there?
You may say ""Well, it goes on forever"", but you forget Pac-Man.
For those who don't know, Pac-Man, back in the 80's, had a limit to the levels you could play. This was because the arcades worked on 8-bit computers, so they could only store an amount of levels that didn't exceed 8-bits.
What are bits? Bits are the number of places in the Binary code that computers use to count. Binary, itself, is a Base-2 counting system that is only allowed to use 2 symbols: 0, and 1.
Say I want to count in Binary. First, I would have 0, then 1. This is great. But, then I want 2, so what do I do? Well, I carry over. So, 2 in Binary is 10. Not ten, but one, zero. Then I add 1 again and I get 11, which is 3.
Now, notice I have 2 digits. That’s what bits are. Suppose I had a 2-bit computer, and each level represented 1. If I kept adding one, I would run out when I hit 3. So, a 2-bit computer can only hold 3 levels.
Forgive me if you already know this stuff, but I’m just trying to be precise to show I’m correct (it’s a math thing).
But anyway, what if I ask again how many levels can an 8-bit computer hold? I could count the number of combinations, yes, but another neat trick is to remember that each digit represents a power of two. The way to notate that is saying 2^n
The first digit is represented by how many 2^0’s I have. It’s crucial that you start with 0 rather than 1. Well, what is 2^0? It’s 1. And the number in that spot tells me how many of those I have.
So, back to Pac-Man. Since we’re using an 8-bit computer, we only have 8 digits:
00000000
That’s the number 0, obviously, but how many levels could I store until I couldn’t add anymore?
Well, if we add 1 to the very left, we remember the power of 2’s, and we find that we have 1 2^7. Then we add another 1 to the digit right of it, and we find that we have one 2^6. In fact, we can keep going and to figure out how many levels an 8-bit computer can hold we just do this: (2^7)n + (2^6)n + (2^5)n + (2^4)n + (2^3)n + (2^2)n + (2^1)n + (2^0)n , where n represents how many of those you have; and if we do that calculation, we find that an 8-bit computer can only hold 255 levels. It can’t hold more because the next digit doesn’t exist to this computer.
So, this is where we find Zombies. The Xbox 360 works on 64-bits, so there’s 64 digits. So, what would happen if we added 1 to each spot?
Well, that would be 2^64 + 2^63 + 2^62 + 2^61  …and so on, until you reach 2^0, and then you add ALL that up, and you get how many levels a 64-bit computer can hold.

So, now for the big finale. I did the calculation myself, and the number of total Zombie rounds there are (until the game starts wigging out) is this:
36,893,488,147,419,103,231
I also did another calculation. Even if you beat a round every single second, it would still take you over a trillion years to get to the end.

I was blown away by how fun it is.  Then I realized, this game is more fun than every cod game after it.  I genuinely enjoyed it more than any other game in the series.  Personally, I can't really play Black Ops 2 or Modern Warfare 3 for more than an hour at a time.  It's just tedious, the same thing over and over.  The balancing is ruining the games.

Unbalanced games are the best games.  Remember Quake and Quake 2?  Those were incredible fun.  The unbalanced weapons make it fun.  You spawn with some crappy machine gun that does nothing and get gibbed all the time by guys with rocket launchers and rail guns.  The fun comes from killing those guys with the top-tier weapons, being better than them.  MW2 is the same, it's not balanced.  The newer, balanced games, are just bland.  They've been balanced too much.  Every weapon feels the same.  They feel like they all do the same damage per second as every other gun, except in special circumstances like gun classes.  All the SMG's feel the same to me, as do all the assault rifles and machine guns.  It's just tedious.  MW2 is much more varied.  Of course there are the classic overpowered guns like the UPM-45, the SPAS-12 and the Barret .50.  However, the people using them are only people, not tanks.  With a tiny bit of thinking power and maybe some teamwork, they're easy to take out, even if they're using the cheapest weapons.  It's just more fun and satisfying taking them out.

So, who wants to play some MW2?  It is easy to boost the community again.  All you have to do is play.  On any console or gaming platform, just play.  Ever player is one more person needed for a game to start.  There are people playing and lobbies form rather quickly (at least on PC), but it could be so much better.  I have hundreds of hours invested in this game for a reason.  It's just so good, so much fun.  Let's play a few rounds.

**TL;DR:** The cod franchise has become boring due to balancing.  Let's go back to mw2 and have some fun.

I don't do it (just not my thing, I'd rather run around with a Tac .45 or move more moderately with an AN-94, personally), but I finally was able to put my finger on why it's so bothersome.

Gun fights are whats fun about CoD, and quickscopers remove that from the game, mostly.  I was recently in a match where there were five or six people quickscoping (on both sides, obviously).  There were very few interesting gunfights.  A lot of turn, hit someone twice and die, and a lot of getting 'legit' sniped over long distances when sprinting across longer sightlines toward cover.

You don't have a gunfight with a quickscoper; you just pray that you can kill them before they get their shot off most of the time.  Toughness is kind of irrelevant, since with or without it, doing damage to the quickscoper doesn't seem to hamper them much.

I respect the hell out of the guys who are good at it; watching them play is often impressive - but I wish it wasn't in CoD because I miss the actual firefights.  I wish there was a way to remove quickscoping from multiplayer - and then add it back in as it's own party game (along with Sticks and Stones and such).  There's definitely a place for it, but in 'normal' multiplayer it feels out of balance (though the number of people who suck at it and fail massively make this less of a problem since most of the time, you'll find half of the quickscopers in a given lobby going WAY, WAY, WAY negative).

I dunno, just rambling; feel free to ignore me - I just had a couple of bad rounds with quickscopers everywhere and am venting.  I'll be back to playing in a little while, I'm sure.",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,,True,t3_1jwwrb,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1jwwrb/i_think_i_know_what_really_bugs_me_about/,

I have also thought that a weather system would be pretty cool, such as imagine 'Outpost' without snow and 'Mission' with heavy rain.

I would really enjoy this if it were a random system for every match so the maps feel somewhat fresh with each play.

To whom it may concern,

We are Reddit NAEGold, a Call of Duty Elite clan on the PlayStation Network. About seven months ago we embarked on a journey to merge two very active reddit.com based Modern Warfare 3 Clans (NAE and NAE2) that  constantly played together on the PlayStation Network. The new clan was named NAEGold. We started with just over 40 heavily dedicated members. We have grown to a modest 66 members and take pride in being very selective in who joins. We try to have a positive influence on one another and we always try to keep it classy. As for our success, we are currently ranked 9th in the world for win percentage on PSN and have a very diverse group of players, of which we are very proud.

As we have grown to know each other, there has been drama, arguments, spreadsheets, tournaments, raffles, giveaways, meetups, rage mics, wins, losses(mostly wins), life lessons and most importantly a sense of belonging and community. Time and time again we get a little cheesy when we talk about what the clan means to us, but the fact of the matter is that for some reason it means a great deal to each and every one of us. It is a very important part of our lives and something many of us look forward to on a daily basis.

The sense of community we have in our small group of just over 60 guys is something we certainly cherish, but not something that we want to take for granted. So, we have decided to come together and share that sense of community and try to spread the joy that gaming has brought us. We feel that if  we work together and put our efforts into helping and giving back we can spread the feeling of community and friendship that our mutual passion for gaming has provided. We really want to give back in the spirit of what we love to do, gaming.

With that said, we have decided that one very important way we can give back is by raising money for  a charity. In our search for a charity we found one very special charity that we felt would help us achieve all of our goals at once. We were lucky enough to discover Child’s Play. For those of you that don’t already know, Child's Play is dedicated to improving the lives of children in hospitals around the world through the kindness and generosity of the video game community and the power of play.

Child’s Play uses the funds that they receive to outfit children's hospitals with various forms of gaming equipment and helps to give them a place to gather and spend time together as well as a play various games. To be honest, this is exactly the goal we were trying to achieve. We wanted to demonstrate how the sense of community and friendship that gaming offers can help improve the lives of those around us. We want to put some effort forth and find a way to share with others what we feel and experience, and we truly believe that Child’s Play will help us share what we experience with children who really need community and friendship to help them through a very tough time in their lives.

Finally, in order to help Child’s Play achieve their goals, and help them enrich the lives of so many children we have decided to hold a 12 hour Black Ops 2 marathon benefiting the Child's Play Charity on April 6, 2013 from 11:59 am - 11:5 9pm EST.

*Death streak* : Not important, but juiced.

________

**Tips, strategies, and tactics.**

(disclaimer: This probably offers no new tips to an intermediate - advanced player, but it is what I used and newer players may find it helpful)


To start, a little but about myself:

*Settings, K/D, and that jazz*

I play on PSN, my ID is ffxpwns.  I am second prestige, lvl 20.  My sensitivity is 8 and I use tacticool button layout.  My K/D is 1.2 and I usually don't roll in a party.  Was this important?  Probably not.  But I put it just so people have the info if they want.


*Tips and tactics*

Okay, where to start?  Lets go with button layout.  Now, while this isn't important per se, I find that it is far easier to do well with tactical.  I'll say why in a second here.

Second: To rush or not to rush?  Let me start out by saying, I don't camp.  I don't have the patience to sit in a corner, kill someone, switch corners, repeat.  So, I'd say I rush for the most part.  While camping can be effective, you look like a douche and I find it boring as all hell.  But a problem lies in rushing.  You are constantly moving, so you must be aware at all times to check who's to your sides, and every now and then, you have to check behind you.  Every single fork, corner, or building, you have to be aware that there could very well be a person inside.  Camping or not, if they are facing your direction, they will probably win that fight. You just don't want to risk it by running blindly into situations like that.  You can do some things to mitigate that risk though.

1.  Prefire.  Prefiring is when you start shooting before you actually enter a room / walk around a corner.  You can choose to hipfire or ADS. The upsides of prefiring is if there is someone there, you are very likely to kill them.  The downsides are you use a LOT of ammo, and if you aren't silenced, people will know exactly where you are. 

2. Walking around a corner ADS.  Basically the same as prefiring, except you don't waste ammo or give away your position.  

3. Stun / nade checks.  Simple enough.  If you are going to enter a potentially enemy filled room, simply throw your tactical or lethal grenade.  This is especially effective if you have recon on, therefor showing your target as a big arrow on your mini map.  But be mindful, you can't replenish grenades, so you may be stuck without one when you really need it.

4.  My method of choice: The jump shot or drop shot.  I will explain these next.


Third: The jump shot and drop shot.  This right here is why I use tactical.  The drop shot is when you see an enemy, you press down on your right thumbstick and shoot at them while you are going to prone, thus minimizing your enemies ability to hit you.  The jump shot is the opposite.  Instead of going prone, you jump when you see an enemy, effectively making yourself harder to hit because you are moving around.  If you get used to these tactics, use them in tandem.  When you go around a corner jump, then go to prone while shooting.  It is extremely hard to hit some one while they are doing this.  Try it yourself!

**Weapons, perks and killstreaks**

Not a whole lot I can say here, seeing as how everyone preference is different.  I would very strongly recommend a silenced weapon with attachments and extended mags / rapid fire, or Just a silencer with focus.  I really like the MP7 ext mags, silenced and the FAD ext mags, silenced.  I would never normally use rapid fire on the MP7, since it only increases fire rate by a mere 11%.  Tmartn has an amazing video on the subject [right here.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws_cCvqMu_k)

Perks.  Again, all up to your preference.   I like SOH, hardline, and marksman.  But its totally up to you to decide.  *Added by popular request*  For SMG's, or faster firing AR's, I would go for scavenger pro as a starter perk, and put sleight of hand as my first attained perk in the specialist package.  That way you aren't constantly looking out for scavenger packs (due to the increase in starting ammo)

Killstreaks.  Ahhh.  here we go.  as far as killstreaks go, I think the choice is clear.  Specialist.  It turns you into a walking powerhouse after 8 kills (7 with hardline), and grants you a perk every 2 kills up until that point.  So by the time you are at 8, it grants you every perk and proficiency simultaneously. When you get blind eye, assassin, and recon.  You are pretty much unstoppable. 

**Peripherals**

I use a standard PS3 controller, for a headset I have tritton AX-720's and I also use [fps freeks thumbsticks](http://www.kontrolfreek.com/FPS/KontrolFreek-FPS-Freek-ELITE.asp).  I find the headset is extremely helpful when you get your specialist bonus, so you have sitrep pro and dead silence and you can soundwhore a little (note: you will only get sitrep pro if you already have it normally, otherwise, you will just get sitrep.) I also find the fps freeks very handy.  Maybe ts just phycological, but I have far more precise aim when if come to those little movements to keep your shots on target. 

Well, that's it for now.  I will add more if I think I've forgotten something.  But I think I included most things I'd like to have.  Comment any cool tips you have discovered!

Edit 2:  User [Gnarlet suggested](http://www.reddit.com/r/mw3/comments/t8vjf/got_my_first_moab_today_heres_how_i_got_it_tips/c4kj8z3) that I add the fire rate and scavenger sections to the article.  So I did!  He also said I should put a note on having hardline as a specialist perk, now while I don't use that I will still leave [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-po9NomIz8) for your consideration.  I understand why he recommended that, but I don't think it's incredibly useful.  But you can watch the video and decide for yourself.

Along with this, I think IW should bring back the night-vision that was in COD 4.

Enjoy.,genericcartoon,45,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/13xe5m/in_remembrance_for_the_voice_over_announcements/,"I felt like the Announcers from WaW made the game feel more intense. It wasn't all whispering and tense growling.

Considering whenever I play BO2, its literally like Normandy 2025 up in hurr - grenades, aerial bombardments, huge firefights - I find it hard to believe that the Ground Commander wouldn't be yelling his orders at us.

Granted - the other side of that is that its an offsite voiceover (assuming any amount of realism) so he's not in the middle of all hell breaking loose, but that's just boring.

I want to be yelled at - and all the Match Beginning and End Match voice overs are awesome. Modern versions of these shouts would just make the game more fun in my opinion.

Some of my favorites Quotes:

1. Russian - They came for our blood, but *drown* in their own!
1. American - A lot of good men died today, all for nothing! 
1. German - A teammate has disappointed the Fuhrer, you *will* not see him again!

You should be shown the current scoreboard, time remaining, map and game mode and given a few seconds to Nope! on out of there.

I'm getting really tired of searching for games and being dropped into the middle of a dom game where we're trip-capped and down by 50 points with less than three minutes remaining, while the enemy team has a VSAT and Warthog in the air.

I don't care if I take a loss by selecting 'no', I just don't want to join the game.  I don't care much about my W/L (I think it's under 1.0 but I am ALWAYS playing randoms/pubs anyway so it's a crapshoot no matter how good (or bad) I am doing) but it just plain isn't fun to join a game in progress and proceed to get face-stomped without being able to fight back.

Stack your class up with perks and sprint around on an objective game type such as domination. The perks I used were... 

PERK 1: Lightweight and Ghost. Lightweight allows you to navigate the map quickly and make your kills swift so you get in and get out. Ghost keeps you of the radar so when the other team is busy trying to get your teammates you can pick them off when their back is turned.

PERK 2: Fast hands and cold blooded. Those two perks allow you to be covert and quick so the enemy has a difficult time making the kill let alone finding you.

PERK 3: Dexterity and Extreme Conditioning. These two perks allow you to be fast and maneuver over objects faster. You can sprint faster as well.

WILDCARDS: Perk greed 1, 2 and 3 of course!

At this point you are probably wondering ""Schrammbo what do I do with this last create a class point!?!"" Well you do whatever the fuck you want with it. I put a combat axe on my class. So that concludes the combat knife section of the guide. On to the next.

The ballistic knife is easy to get. I have no advice other than play ALOT of sticks and stones. There isn't any class setup for it because I played sticks and stoned but if you don't want to play sticks and stones then for your class just use everything in the combat knife portion of the guide and then spend your last point on the ballistic knife.

Same goes for the crossbow. PLAY ALOT OF STICKS AND STONES. I cannot stress this enough. Once you get most of your challenges you will probably get stuck on the bloodthirsty challenge. I just got mine in sticks and stones but it is difficult seeing as you have to get 5 kills with the 6 bolts you get. If you don't like that idea then you can go into any playlist (free for all suggested) and put on the Tri-Bolt attachment with your crossbow. Put on scavenger and then whatever else you feel comfortable using. With the tri-bolt attachment you can rush the enemy team and get direct impact kills if you're close enough. Direct impact kills make the enemy drop scavenger packs to replenish your ammo so it will come pretty quick.

As for the Assault/Riot Shield I suggest playing hard core. It is a one hit kill in hardcore allowing you to pick up more kills. 
For my perks I ran the same as my combat knife class, stacking the classes with perks help a lot. 
There is a camo for the assault/riot shield that says ""get 25 combat axe kills while holding the assault shield"" no worries, it may seem hard at first but it's easy. Put on fast hands and danger close and then when the enemy is unloading his clip at you and has to reload you just whip out a combat axe and nail him with it.

So that is my guide on how I got diamond camo for my special weapons. If you have any questions feel free to comment down below or PM me.

1348000562.0,36,self.CallOfDuty,103j94,Why I feel stopping power is a necessary perk in Call of Duty.,,45,9,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/103j94/why_i_feel_stopping_power_is_a_necessary_perk_in/,"Stopping power, although many people feel it is permanently unbalanced, in my opinion is necessary to the balance of the game.

Assuming it stays in the same perk slot as it originally was, it provided alternate options to other perks that have now taken over as blatantly overpowered.  In MW3, the only viable perk is assassin.  Why is that?  None of the other options are a reasonable alternative.  Assuming the CoD4 perk setup plus others from MW2, you have stopping power, UAV Jammer, Lightweight, Overkill, Danger Close.  Now assuming these perks all have pro version, stopping power has no real use with a pro upgrade.  It is just stopping power.

Now on the other hand, people who choose assassin (uav jammer) get a noticeable bonus with the pro perk (no red crosshairs).  Lightweight also gets a bonus, although that has changed from game to game, as does danger close.  Overkill is just a situationally strong perk depending on how it is used.  

Now if you take stopping power out of the equation of these perks, you are left with a few perks that have noticeable strengths when used in the right situation, but for the majority of players, the only option they are left with is assassin.

Now if stopping power is an option, players who aren't looking for stealth gameplay, need the faster sprint, or extra explosive damage, have an alternative perk.  And stopping power has served its purpose.  It gives people who don't have any other alternative choices a perk that will provide them with a noticeable benefit.  In MW3, UAV's are useless.  Every player is using assassin.

With the reintroduction of stopping power, each perk will return to its primary function and still serve a purpose, while one does not clearly dominate.

One might argue that stopping power would then become staple for competitive play, but this has always been the case.  In every single Call of Duty game.  Ever.  But most people don't play competitively.  And bringing back stopping power allows for a larger variety of useful perks within normal pub games.

TL;DR: Bring back stopping power, other perks all also remain situationally strong and useful depending on the playstyle.",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,,True,t3_103j94,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/103j94/why_i_feel_stopping_power_is_a_necessary_perk_in/,

Call of Duty 4- I played for about 3 hours last night at about 7:00 pm Mountain standard time, U.S.A. Everything went very well in the exception of one bout of lag, but that only lasted a couple of seconds. As far as lobbies, Free for all had hackers that floated and got out of the map. Your best bet is TDM. I had no trouble finding a host and with no Hackers. But still be careful. People I talk to reported de-rank lobbies. Still worth the risk in my opinion. Overall, it was a good experience and I had fun with the nostalgia. Highly suggest you go back to it.
 
CoD: World at war- Stay away! WaW is a mess. I tried to play, but could only stand it for about 30 minutes. Hackers everywhere with god mode, flying across the map, aim bots. The only lobby that was even remotely playable still had this thing where your character slid around the map as if on ice. People I talked to on there also reported de-ranking lobbies. I don't think anyone would have fun playing WaW right now. I don't suggest it.

Modern Warfare 2- This one still has a strong following, even in S&amp;D. Although I still ran into some boosters in free for all. TDM is the place to be. Had a lot of fun. No hackers that I ran into. MW2 is one of my favorites and I'll be on later tonight. Highly suggested.

Black Ops 1- Still has a strong following. Didn't see anything unusual TDM was great, FFA, S&amp;D all have strong followings. I had one report of a de-rank lobby, but the guy said that was 3 months ago and he had not seen one since. Had no problem getting into a lobby. Overall, a good experience.

So, there you have it. My over all assessment after playing all these games in the span of about a week. I mostly played in the late evenings, that seemed to have the best results. Although I ran into a couple of hackers here and there, everything else seem to have a positive experience. Keep in mind, this is on Xbox. I don't know the status on PC or PS3. And enter these games at your own risk. There are still hackers out there. TDM seems to be the safest place to be. So, go out and have fun my fellow Redditers! I'll keep coming back to these games periodically and let you all know if anything changes.

Well, I have an idea to better the CoD Campeign mode. 

Instead of just being thrown into a mission, you need to go and have your CO or whoever is in charge, and they assign you the mission. You choose a small 4 man squad (you and 3 NPC). Some missions might automatically replace a NPC with a storyline-based member. You also choose their area of speciality. Want all heavy gunners? One heavy gunner, a CQC teammate, and a rifleman? Hell, want to sacrifice one of your men to have a sniper to help you out? Go ahead. He will act like McKnight in BOII's mission *Suffer With Me*. 

After you are assigned a mission, head over to the armoury. Choose your weapon, accessories, whatever you want. Think you'll need night vision? Take it. Only catch, the game won't tell you what you would need for the mission. Want better sights? Well, between missions, hit up the shooting range. Build up experience with the weapons, get items, etc. Enter into a shooting competition to win a special weapon, such as the Desert Eagle or the iconic M82A1 sniper. 

After you arm yourself, you move over to the camo area, where you choose to go deep cover (civilian clothes) stealth (ghillie suit, wet suit for water based missions), etc. These outfits are mission dependent. Don't think you can do a water-based mission dressed as a middle eastern farmer. 

Finally, you're ready to leave on your mission. If you find yourself in need of an item you didn't take with you, well, you will learn from your mistakes. There is still a storyline, but you actually get to prep your team. 


Sorry for the wall of text. What do y'all think? Also, any suggestions to add to the idea?


TL;DR: you are of no use to us by being lazy. ***BOOM*** *headshot*




    Here starts the Redditors ideas.
 * Your 4 man squad can be 4 player multiplayer online.

Whoever is doing their music needs a swift slap up their face and kicked to the street, he isn't doing his job right. Get a new guy. I don't care where, but have him show some demos, and if they're up to fuckin Marty-O-Donnel par, then welcome aboard.

Next, new gun designs. We're in the future now, right? Well stop making already existing guns look futuristic, and instead, just actually make some new concepts for weapons. Think outside the box. Not a Neo-M16, but a Gravity Gun. (Not saying rip off the GG, but, you know) This also applies to grenades.

Ok but now let's focus on the real bad boys. All the tropes that come with a COD campaign need to get their dick crunched by a steel toed boot. Let's start with um... erm.. health. Health needs a complete redo. No more get shot, hide behind cover, suck your thumb, regenerate health, rinse and repeat. Bother that nonsense. Instead, bring in the doom style health system. That's right, start with the big 100, or maybe have like 10 bars of health, or have, whatever, have a health system that *does not regenerate*, but requires*first aid kits* to gather health back. You could even go as far as to also take the Doom armor system or some variation of. Pick up a helmet off a dead soldier, 25+ armor, idk.

Now we're getting good, but we aren't finished turning these unsalted peanuts into a lobster dinner just yet. Next up is redoing the horrid level design. By god, the insurmountable amount of linear paths boggles my mind. Levels need to get creative and involve multiple paths. Not only such, but even should have light puzzle elements. Not necessarily making you solve a puzzle to get by, but maybe, say, exploding a crane that will drop whatever it's holding onto a group of enemies. I know it sort of does this already, but not enough of it. And hell, why not make puzzles that should be solved to get through? They could also be light, like having to shoot an exploding barrel that will set a rope on fire that burns down the door to let you through. But the bottom line is that there needs to be more than one fucking path.

Now, this goes hand in hand with the before. I cannot say this enough, and if anything gets through, it's this. STOP. THE. MOTHER. FUCKING. COMMANDS. When there's spotlights shining through, we do NOT need our partner to shout at the top of his longs to avoid the spot lights. We do NOT need our partner to tell us to get down when there is a fucking tank driving near us. We do NOT need our partner to tell us to stay quiet when we are HIDING FROM THE ENEMIES ALREADY AS HAS BEEN DECLARED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MISSION. Teammates need to keep their goddamned mouths shut. They can speak for characterization, or say things like RELOADING, but I swear to god if they even go as far as to *suggest* I take out the guy on the roof, balls are getting tapped. With a brick. A really dirty one.

Ah, see, we've dissected the pig and we're ripping out it's organs, BUT, we're replacing them with better, stronger, robotic parts. We HAVE the technology. Let's not stop yet. A big issue comes down to enemies. They aren't varied worth a shit. You've got the military guys with red berets, and the military guy with green berets, and sometimes, once on a lucky moon, you get a military guy with blue berets. The all stand there retardedly and shoot, occasionally ducking, sometimes jacking their partner, but overall, just being human. So why don't we make an effort to make the enemies varied? I'm not talking about introducing freaking aliens or mutants or something, but why not different, unique strands of the military? Ok, say we have our standard army dude with a gun of his choice. Now, let's throw assassins into the mix, similar to the black ops of Half Life. They can be sneaky and use the knife primarily. Now let's throw Juggernauts into the mix. They've been there before, for, uh, um, one mission? Have them as regular as a Hunter in Halo. Let's think even more outside the box. Have special marines that only use pistols but they build up barricades for themselves. They'd be fast too, so it'd be a bit of trouble to take 'em out. And hell, while we're at it, let's throw kamikaze guys regularly. Shoot 'em and detonate 'em before they explode on Y-U-O. I misspelled that. The point is, the possibilities for variation are endless. Variation is NOT different beret types. While we're on that, make sure to give each of these varied enemies color and outfit differences. We don't want all these cool and different enemies to still have the same hair style, do we?

I almost wouldn't mention vehicles because after playing Black Ops 2, I am pleasantly surprised that vehicles had a lot of action in the campaign. By god was it fun as hell to drive that car through the highway, or more importantly, lead a horse on a desperate struggle. But I mention this because the vehicle sections are *forced sections*. I don't like that and neither should you. It should almost always (I'm excluding escape scenes and other actual plot specific parts) be optional to go on foot or hop on the APC. Makes for re playability to have it set up this way, and more importantly, gives the player a lot more control.

Not even close to being done. That's a lie, we are close. But not done. Characters and the story need a scientifically approved amount: SHITTON of improvement. Black Ops 2 had me laughing so hard because there were so many goddamned betrayals it just got silly. You got to the point where everybody you would meet would betray you at some point. It's ridiculous and makes the player not want to care about anyone, and that's bad for character development. There should be more personal dialogue that extends the characteristics of one. I'm not saying in the middle of a firefight we should have Mason tell us he snuggles with Hello Kitty dolls every Thursday, but by god, I want to be able to tell a character is terrified, or amused, or has conflicting feelings, or just, SOMETHING. I mention story beside my existing argument for characters because I literally have no idea what could be done to fix it. There's little you can do, and I sort of appreciate the story of Black Ops 1 a teensy bit. At this point, the best I can do is shrug.

Cutscenes. Cutscenes, cutscenes, cutscenes. I'm so goddamned sick of cutscenes. When it gets to the point where you take 20 steps and have a cutscene, then take another 20 steps forward and have another cutscene, and then take ANOTHER 20 STEPS FORWARD AND HAVE A CUTSCENE, it gets aggravating. Yes, when I plunge into the water, I don't need an automatic swim for me, just give me controller options to swim. Yes, when an explosion happens, I don't need to have to fall down and do the jazz hands maneuver for the fifth time. Yes, when a vehicle is falling, I don't need my controller to be taken away from me because I can very well use the A button just very fucking fine. It's just repulsive how much the game assumes you can't do on your own and initiates a beautifully rendered cutscene of you staring at a dude's mustache. Forget the game and just make a goddamn movie if this is how it has to be done.

Oh lordy Lucifer I've typed over 7000 words. There's just so much more that can be done to the Campaign that could make it playable, creative, and...

Despite the game modes popularity, it does feel like a little ""extra"" added in along with the SP and MP. 
   Obviously it takes time and money to develop zombies content for treyarch, so why not develop a tool (most easily compared to Halo's Forge mode) to allow players to create there own playable Zombie maps which could be shared with the community. Players could then play and rate maps so the most fun maps can easily be downloaded.
   I think this added tool would not only help the zombies gamemode, but cod games in general. The opportunity to be creative and bring your own ideas to life in one of your favourite games would appeal to nearly all call of duty fans and newer players alike. I would personally purchase a COD game if it have this feature alone. It would also increase the life of the game with content continuosly being made by COD's huge community. 
   Despite thinking that this idea would improve the COD series, I can see why Treyarch or more likely Activision would not like this idea. This map making tool (assuming it's free as DLC or with the game) will mean huge amounts of content will be generated which the developers and publishers can't profit off of. That's why I suggest that the tool could be sold as DLC with the price of maybe a map pack. You could even have microtransactions for features in the map like new traps/guns the players can put in there maps. Or it could become a feature for the COD elite. Once the tool is made the companies could then continue to profit off the tool while not actually spending time and money on new zombie content. Think of how many more people would buy COD elite!
   
   TL;DR  I love Zombies and there should be a map designer/editor so the community can make awesome maps for everyone to play. Make it free/DLC/elite, either way everyone wins  ",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,,True,t3_zc9pz,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/zc9pz/there_should_be_a_zombies_map_creatordesigner_tool/,

Firstly, I have been playing CoD since COD4 (Like most of you) and it was fun, but it was still really fresh to me. 
Then WaW came around and I wasn't totally happy with it. I played it for a few weeks and it got boring so I sold it.

Then comes one of the greatest (and most broken Call of Duty's): MW2. 

Now you cannot lie and say you didn't play the shit out of that game. It was new, everything had been revamped. Basically the biggest change in the franchise since COD4, but it was broken and they did not try to fix it.

Months went by and we all eagerly awaited the next game in the franchise, which was Black Ops. 

We stopped playing MW2 and retreated back to COD4. Our so-called baby, the best there was, until of course October came around. October 2010 was our catch up month, we went back to MW2 to train for the next big game.

November rolled in and we fell in love with Black Ops, but it still felt the same. Mostly because it was. But the zombies mode really made the game fun. (But you can't forget the frequent fixes and patches). The game was balanced, which was good and we enjoyed it up until MW3 came out.

Now out of the all the Call of Duty's, this one was one the most disappointing ones yet. It was garbage and still is. I sold it a couple of months after it came out. 

Back to Black Ops.

Now Black Ops was the best in my personal opinion.

To illustrate my point, I'll describe two games and the times I played them. It's noteworthy that I'm a pretty bad player, with just a 1.31 K/d ratio, whose highest scorestreak ever called in was an AGR. If you just want to hear what I noticed, skip to the bolded section ""What I Noticed"".

**2:30pmEST**  
I hopped into a lobby for some Kill Confirmed (pubs, no league play or anything).  The lobby fills up, and several people are above me in the Lobby Leaderboards. I see that the top players on the leaderboard prefer rushing weapons like SMG's and the M126 (automatic shotgun, I think?). I was playing with a friend, and about to change my Lightning Strike to an Orbital Vsat, which would be the highest streak I've ever used. He jokingly say ""Run swarm!"", so I put swarm on. Poking gentle fun throughout the game I said ""Remember, I'm going for swarm gameplay here, I have to play it safe"" as I was rushing with my FAL OSW. Then I noticed that I got a Merciless medal, which I rarely ever do (only ever had about 64 before out of hundreds of games and tens of thousands of kills). I looked, and Swarm was about three kills away. I just about shit myself with excitement, and wound up picking it up and my second Relentless medal. Our team ended up losing, because my teammates weren't having as good of a game as I was and because we were going against a very good team. After the game, we all said out ""Good Games"" and did a few more. It was a really enjoyable experience, and my body felt numb after calling in my first Swarm. It was so fun, I decided to play again later in the night.

**9:30pmEST**  
I checked the Lobby Leaderboards in this kill confirmed, and I was the top by over 50 score per minute! I was happy, because I thought I could call in my Vsat, Warthog, Dog combo. It was Drone, which is an inherit sniper-fest, but still an overall very fun map. The first death I had was by two ballistic-knifers zig-zag sprinting with lightweight and cornering me. This was partially my fault, because I paniced when I saw them. There was one guy on my team that continuously killed himself with the SMAW (at the end of the game he had over 200 deaths). There were also two gentlemen with riot shields and party rock shotguns in the building across from the factory. They didn't leave the position the whole game, and only wound up with a handful of kills because of how unpopular the location was (and because we just couldn't get the spawns to flip). I was able to get Vsat, but twice I was within 2 kills of my first k9 Unit, only to get tomahawked the first time (he bankshotted down the stairs in the factory, almost a guaranteed kill) and Noscoped the second (my killer was using a silenced SVU-AS). Frustrating game, but still fun because there were some unusual people.

**What I Noticed**  
Quite the contrary to what I thought would be the case, it seems that the tryhards all play very early in the day, at least for the EST timezone. Then, later in the night all of the 360noscopeyolo#420blazeitfaggot kids come out to troll. So, for the many posts and Youtube videos I see complaining about these kinds of players, try playing earlier in the day. My original hypothesis was that 9:30pm would be too late for them to even be up, but it seems to be just the opposite. I hope this advice helps anyone like me, that just wants to tryhard a bit to experience parts of the games that toxic players don't let them reach.

**TL;DR: Play earlier in the day**

But lately the trend seems to be that oh, we're fucking Redbox thieves. We apparently have shifted gears from ""Kind of a bunch of douchebags"" to ""full-on dickheads"". And that bums me out. 

I live in a generally urban, crime-ridden area myself. When I went to Halo 4's launch party, though, things went off without a hitch. It was fun times. Real good vibe going on. Then came the Black Ops launch. Holy shit, it was a different group. On the whole it was much louder, much more disorganized, there was a *ton* more litter, people were drinking and by the smell of the place you'd think every last person there was smoking weed (Neither of which I have a problem with anybody doing.. At home.)

And now it's no secret that apparently Black Ops II is a hot ticket item for scumbags to rip off from Redbox kiosks. You don't see /r/gaming flooded with printed out fake Halo discs. Experiencing both launches back to back the past two weeks, I think I was forced to see how vastly different the two games' communities really are. I always thought it was no big deal, I play both, plenty of people do. It can't really be *that* much of a divisive and culturally different thing can it? I'm starting to think maybe it can.

Both cultures have their small pocket of bad apples, but why do you suppose Call of Duty's seem to be so much worse? I've been trying to figure that out for a few days now.

A high K/D basically just means that you can get the high killstreaks with some consistency. I'm not saying that all these people are killwhores who ignore the objective, but a fair number of them are. If K/D weren't tracked, I feel like people would be more inclined to just play the gametype without worrying about slightly raising a number/preventing it from slightly decreasing.

I'll concede that K/D is a quick and dirty way to size up pubs, but W/L is totally useless, in particular the win streak. All it means is that you don't go into lobbies alone, you're a dashboarder, or both. I can't count the number of times I've been dropped from a game because the host couldn't handle breaking his win streak/taking a loss. Instead of penalizing quitters by giving them a loss, maybe they could just lock them out for some period of time if they quit repeatedly. 

Just my two cents.

Some of you may have done something like this before, but I thought I'd share it anyways.

The goal of my little game is to stay behind someone for as much time as possible without them noticing you. I capture that footage (and other amusing events) in theater mode, and as a I have a few good edited games saved to my vault. My current record is 1:19 behind someone.

*Some Tips, in case anyone wants to try this:*

[Here is the class I use.](http://www.ign.com/builds/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3?d=03006007300003600006200008209009410812012200000000013914014500000000017) Basically anything like this is fine, the only really necessary things are the Radar, Assassin, Dead Silence, and the Shotgun (because what's the fun without it?)

If you don't have the DLC, play on Erosion as much as possible. Throw your radar in the tunnels under the tower in the center and wait for them to stare down the road, then follow as they imminently dash in.

If someone's trying to boost with you, make sure to have a Tac Insert on hand, preferably with something that kills quickly, like a throwing knife, to take them out when they get to 23 kills or so.

Don't be afraid to wait around for the match to end. If you get a few kills at the beginning of the match when they're unwary of what you're doing, then you'll have a slight lead. At this point, some people like to pull out their MP7 ninja class or the equivalent, which, unless you have quite a bit of skill, is fairly hard to go up against. Since you have a lead, though, you can hide away and run down the clock. Bingo, win's yours.

I'm not trying to snitch on these people but people have been showing more and more interest in this game and I want to give them some advice before they join in.

 So when you join a match look at the gamertags. There is the obvious rainbow thing and the shaking but if the player has a clan tag with ""RAIN"", ""Cycl"" or anyothers leave the match. They are some of the hackers. They will change the colour of the maps, use ""God Mode"", slow down gun firing rates and make it so you can't move or that you can only fly.

These are some of the gamertags of the hackers.

In every single Call of Duty game before Black Ops, we played as random soldiers of varying rank. We weren't special, and we got to experience the battlefield as any other soldier would have. Now, whenever I play CoD, we play as a special ops soldier who is trained and badass. 

Don't get more wrong; I really enjoy playing the new CoD games. But I always thought that the best part of these games were the ability to play as an unknown soldier and follow him through whatever fate had in store for him.  I think that the best parts of these games were when you took a grunt soldier through the beaches of Normandy, the remnants of a devastated German city, or with an army of modern soldiers through a middle-eastern town. I always loved these sections of gameplay that made me feel like a small piece of the puzzle of war, who occasionally stepped up to achieve heroism when he had to. But now, we play as a badass spec ops dude who fearlessly slo-mo walks into gunfire and blows shit up and hacks enemy computer systems. 

Let me know if you have any thoughts. Like I said, I still like the game and enjoy the single/mulitplayer, but I really miss the old concepts that connected me to the characters.  I don't know about you guys, but I really miss that feeling when you play as a WWII grunt, and right after you capture a crucial command point, your squad leader gets a radio call that forces you to backtrack, or tells you that you're progress was worthless.  It made me consider the hardships that actual soldiers face. 

Tl;dr  How do you feel about the way that CoD has changed over the years? I feel that it's become sensationalized and too badass, compared to the concept of playing as a simple soldier in a large war.

I am not a huge fan of most CoD games. I downloaded CoD 4 recently on steam because my friend bought it and loved it especially for promod. But my question to you is, what makes it so fun? I usually don't have that much fun in CoD 4 simply because of the lack of variety. I don't know if I am stepping into hostile territory here but... I am a hardcore battlefield fan. I love battlefield games so much. The vehicles and larger maps makes ever game something new. But Whenever I play Call of Duty... it seems like the same thing over and over. I mean I just don't see the fun in running around with most likely the same gun on a small map over and over...

I'm sorry If this post offends Call of Duty players, I'm just trying to figure out a way to enjoy the games more.

And if you where wondering, I have played the more recent game titles but only on the Xbox 360, and I don't find them any more fun... most likely because I much prefer keyboard and mouse to Xbox controller.",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,,True,t3_1czasp,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1czasp/to_all_still_active_cod_4_players_what_makes_this/,

[Article 2](http://www.shacknews.com/article/76005/call-of-duty-black-ops-2-security-servers-detailed)

&gt;Treyarch has posted a new FAQ for the PC fans of Black Ops 2. This time they are discussing how the PC team will handle online security, matchmaking info, and servers info.

&gt;**What anti-cheat will be used?**

&gt;*Anti-cheat is a top priority for Call of Duty®: Black Ops II. We have developed our own proprietary server-side anti-cheat technology which will work alongside VAC to deliver the most advanced detection and banning capabilities of any Call of Duty game to date. We have also improved our player reporting system to make it the most effective way that you can help us catch cheaters. And starting on launch day we will have a full-time dedicated pc anti-cheat team focused solely on detecting and banning cheaters. We have a zero tolerance policy on cheating. Cheaters bans are permanent.*

&gt;**Will Black Ops have Matchmaking or Dedicated Servers?**

&gt;*Both! Call of Duty®: Black Ops II PC combines matchmaking with secure ranked dedicated servers. This means that you get into Public Matches or League Play via matchmaking lobbies. It is easy to party up and play with your friends. You can adjust your classes or scorestreaks between matches. It also means that every Public or League match is hosted on a dedicated server running in one of our high bandwidth datacenters around the globe.*

&gt;**Will you release the server files?**

&gt;    *No. We are keeping the server files secure to protect the game from hacking and cheating and ensure the ranking and progression system integrity.*

&gt;**Can I rent a server?**

&gt;    *No. We are providing a huge number of servers around the world at no extra charge – plenty for everyone to enjoy. And we will administer the servers.*

&gt;**Will there be mod tools?**

&gt; *No. As we continually improve and advance our in-house tools for our own content teams we are unable to provide consumer tools due to increased technical requirements, licensing restrictions, and technology dependencies.*


I stumbled on these articles just hours after I pre-ordering my PC copy. I skipped MW3 and had written off the series for being stagnant and repetitive, but the few past weeks I've been getting a little excited about BO2. Branching story paths, a re-worked multiplayer suite, zombies, spectator mode, Treyarch at the helm...it actually seemed like they had finally made some changes that were worthy of a purchase. But after reading this news I might actually cancel it. I realize console players won't care in the slightest but this shit is ridiculous. Dedicated, *player controlled* servers, mods, and configuring the game are why PC gamers chose their platform. These are all things that have been restricted in this release and it's a slap in the face to the PC community. COD4 is still going strong precisely because it allowed players to do what they wanted: host their own games, with their own rules, with their own mods. This is just ridiculous.",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,,True,t3_10t46m,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/10t46m/black_ops_2_pc_features_detailed_no_mod_tools_no/,

Unfortunately, my friend had borrowed it and scratched the daylights out of it on accident. After MW3 had grinded my gears, I had switched to Battlefield. Switching back to COD is no easy task, but I'm glad I did it. To those of you who don't know, Battlefield 3 is a team-based game, in which getting in-game kills only help your team so much. To get a high score, you MUST play the objective. Don't get me wrong, I have no beef with either game series. Call of Duty has its flaws, and Battlefield has its flaws. Anyway, I was playing Search and Destroy (still my favorite gametype) and trying to win. I had my ACR with FMJ (don't hate, its my class setup, and damn if its effective), and was trying to defend the bombs and help out my team, and then I remembered what had turned me away from Call of Duty. Quickscopers. Don't get me wrong, I love quickscoping. That's the one thing I liked about MW3, the epic free-for-all matches on Dome. I also get why they wanted to do it in S&amp;D. Epic round winning killcams. The problem is with this is that I, and a couple other people, wanted to actually play the objective. These guys didn't help. Always looking for a great kill, but usually if not always screwing it up. It isn't fun when I get killed by someone, and then the only person left on my team is some Optic-Wannabe who tries to get an epic across-the-map no scope while jumping to his death on Highrise when he knows that there are still a few guys on the enemy team.

As someone who has always played COD in a knifey style I was very happy with the camo introduction and have been screen-shotting all the knives in game. This was partly because I found some of the camo's quite disappointing such as Ronin which just looks like a bit of a smear. I couldn't find a resource showing the in game screenshots rather than just the camo previews shown alongside the challenges so thought I'd do it myself.

I'm still working on Diamond but will update when I eventually get to it, likely to take a few days.

I am not here to critisize a playstyle or judge someone in some way, I just want to share some thoughts that I had some weeks ago!

In my opinion a good player should always try to win, be aggressive and of course shouldn't get the worst kd-ratio doing this. The kd-ration is easy to find out in the stats, but my question was, how can you find out if a player is an aggressive teamplayer only from the stats in the barracks? 

I think the best way to find that out is to look at his kill confirmed stats. To be able to win a lot in kill confirmed you have to collect tags, which often lets you play more aggressive and which also helps your team to win the game. In my opinion you can consider yourself an aggressive teamplayer if your confirmed kills and your denied kills added together are higher than your overall kills in kill confirmed.

And here is the thing: It is very rare to see a player who fulfills the point from above AND also has a very good kd-ratio!

Being in experiment-mode I decided to try to join these two together and created a so called overall-kd. It would work like this (example for my stats):

kills confirmed: 51353; kill denied: 11001; overall kill confirmed kills: 59655; kd-ratio: 1.879

[(51353+11001)/59655]*1.879 = 1.964 overall-kd

I know that this idea is maybe a bit crazy and I will maybe get downvoted to oblivion, but I just wanted to share my thoughts about the whole topic. Of course there are other factors like the weapon you use or your internet connection that influence all this, but in my opinion iusing this you will get a pretty good idea if someone is a good player or not.

I also don't think using your winrate in this equation would be a good idea because it can be influenced too easily by playing with a full lobby of people or just playing one gametype were it is easy to win just by getting kills like team deathmatch.

When I got to *Call of Duty 2*, I was floored with nostalgia, mainly due to [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Wv_G3nwEDE). (*CoD 2* was the first game I ever really played. So it really kind of defined my childhood).


Naturally, I rooted around my room until I found the disc, and started playing. It made me so happy to be taking Point-du-Hoc, and to be assaulting El Alamein once more.


During a break to the little men's room, I compared the game I was playing to the newest games in the franchise. And I was surprised that they were under the same name! The games have a totally different feel to them. 


So, I thought that it'd be awesome for Infinity Ward or whoever-the-fuck it is now to make a game with that sort of feel again. I would play the absolute shit out of it if they made it.


Honestly, the best I can think of would be a blend between *CoD 2* and *CoD WaW*. The settings of *Cod 2* were fantastic: it truly portrayed WWII as a *global* conflict. If they combined that with the serious and somber mood of *WaW*, (and got a new *fucking* engine) it would be amazing. 


I'd also love to see something like *Halo 4's* Spartan Ops. A co-op story separate from the campaign would be extremely fun. Perhaps it could be about a USMC squad in the Pacific theater (this setting was noticeably lacking from most of the games). 


As for multiplayer (because you can't make a game nowadays without it), I'd love to see the bigger maps of *WaW*. Perhaps even some vehicles. Tanks are *always* fun to play around with. 


Some might look at that description, and think, ""You're posting this in the wrong spot. That sounds like a *Battlefield* spinoff."" Perhaps they're right. *Battlefield* titles with vehicles have always fared better than *CoD* games with them. But I'd much prefer the fast paced gameplay that *CoD* has. I find the gameplay of *Battlefield* to be sluggish, slow. 


But hey, I don't know of every game out there! If you happen to know of a game like this already made, please let me know. Anything is better than nothing, right?









tl;dr

I want a game with the feel of *CoD 2*. It'd be awesome, like, fo'reals. ",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,360,True,t3_1afv3q,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1afv3q/we_need_to_go_back/,

There are only two weapons I would consider to be shit.

Also, the [Executioner](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Executioner) is pretty shitty too. It generally takes 3-4 shots to kill somebody, which is pretty bad considering it only hold 5 shells, and has a limited range like a shotgun. The other pistols are much better.

Why? They tell us that every title is almost exactly the same game. I see huge important differences between COD4, World at War, MW2, Black Ops and MW3. Each one feels like a unique game, while retaining the core aspects of COD that I like. Why can't I admit that all the games are the same? 

They tell us we should be tired of playing new iterations of the same game every year, and instead we should just keep playing Counterstrike or TF2. 

They tell us we should enjoy Battlefield more. I don't like Battlefield because I find it too slow, and the controls are not as responsive as COD. I also fucking hate vehicles, but they tell me I should prefer BF because it has vehicles. Battlfield has three basic game modes. COD has TDM, FFA, SnD, Kill Confirmed, Team Defender, Gun Game, one in the Chamber, Sticks and Stones, Hardcore variants, Demolition, HQ, Sabotage, CTF, etc. Why am I unable to prefer a game with just three game modes, over a game with many more? Should I get a mental evaluation because I am unable to appreciate the obvious superiority of the Battlefield franchise? 

They tell me my eyes can't tell a difference between 30 and 60 frames per second, yet I *clearly* can tell a difference, especially in a faster paced game. Should I get my eyes examined? 

They tell me that every match in COD is packed full of 12 year old racists yelling N-word and faggot on the mic. Yet when I play, 99% of the time it's just regular people trying to have fun, and most of the chat is just normal conversation. Should I get my ears checked because I'm not hearing the constant stream of 12 year old profanity? 

They tell me I should hate MW3 because it is just a map pack of MW2. No. MW3 feel like a new game to me- Kill Confirmed and Team Defender are two refreshingly new game modes. Gun proficiencies are neat concept as well. The amount of class customization is so vast. Why do I insist on like a game that I've been told to hate?

They tell me I should be mad that COD doesn't have a ""new engine"". Yet no other shooter offers the same super fast responsive gameplay as COD. On console, where the *vast* majority of fps players reside, absolutely no other shooter is as smooth and fast as COD. So why do I like the ""tired old engine"" of COD?

The subjective way is, What game did I have the most fun in?  This is usually the first CoD game that you played, which for most people was MW2, but there are also a lot of CoD4 people and a lot of Black Ops people in there as well.

The objective way (or at least an attempt at being objective) is, Pretend you are the median/average CoD player before ever playing CoD, and someone presented you with all six games side by side to try out. Which one would you find the most fun?

Now obviously even that won't be completely objective because it's a hypothetical, but that's the way to think about it.  And given that criteria I think BO2 would be the most fun for the average player if lined up right beside all of the others (further and even more controversial, I think MW3 would be a close 2nd).  If you played COD4 and BO2 side by side for the first time I think most people would find CoD4 to be a little boring.  If you played MW2 and MW3 side by side you would find MW3 has more variety and is more fair than MW2.

Most of the time 9/10 games, ill be having 4bars. But it seems as though the game is lagging bad. Eg: running with an smg and when I stop and aim it shifts my aim sideways randomly, no relating to the sway, random left and right aim lag. Also while running it lags and the player seems to strafe sideways randomly. One more problem was that if I press the PS button during a match I get kicked, after numerous amounts of these kicking out bs, I got put into probation.

Things I have tried :
Reinstalled the 1.07 patch
Tried a different controller
Thought it might be hardware problem so tried with other games (dead space 3, mw 3, assassins creed 3) but thet hadno such issue
Blew air into vents of ps3
Looked in theater and my gameplay seemes fine, no lag


All this happened after the 1.07 patch. And now, I get kicked out just before a match ends. The message will read ""disconnected from black ops 2 servers"". And when i connect back in I lose all the xp I had earned during the match and also get put into probation. I have paid hard earned money for this and will not resolve with just letting the problem go. If nothing can be done I will have to resort to selling this game.

On the other side there is the power button . When you press the button a bolt of lightning hits the empire state building, and power is restored to the map, and the rest of the city lights up as well. Now the twist is that when you use PHD flopper you take no fall damage, so if you have the perk and you get over-run on top, you can jump off the edge of the building to escape. In the metro system under ground, the main trap is you can call a subway which drives through running over the zombies. A special grenade could be a Molotov cocktail.

If you're getting MW3 and haven't subscribed to r/mw3 yet, you should probably give it a look-see.

As you probably already know, we've been using the flair feature to append gamertags/platforms to Reddit usernames for the past few months now.

Unfortunately, when the flair system was first introduced, only the mods could add flair to usernames. This was a pretty slow and tedious task, so in an effort to speed things up a little, we created a bot that would take names from redditgaming.net and upload them in batches. While the bot was a much better and faster option, it still relied on some manual tweaking each time it had to be run.

Recently, the admins added a new feature that allows regular users to edit their own flair themselves.


###How to add/edit your gamertag:

**Step One**:

If you look over at the side bar on the right, you should see an edit button beside your username. Click on it. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/iZISa.png). 

**Step Two**:

You'll be given a list of platforms to choose from. Click on the platform that you play on. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/3qdM8.png).

**Step Three**:

A textfield will appear. Enter your GT/PSN ID/STEAM ID into that field and click on save. [Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/Ffayd.png). 

That's it.

Btw, if you abuse this flair system, the mods will probably come down hard on you. i.e. this flair system is for gamertags only, so no messing about. We reserve the right to remove your flair if we think that you're being an ass. Repeated abuse will most likely result in a ban.",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,360,True,t3_lu304,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/lu304/everyone_can_now_instantly_add_or_edit_the/,moderator

Aim, while it seems simple, is a huge factor especially in public matches. If you can lock onto a target in milliseconds out to a good distance, you will win almost every gunfight.

Since I haven't really played any of the series yet and I don't want to spend 60€ on a game right now, I'm thinking I might as well start with one of the earlier games, because they're only half the price now.

So the decision is between MW1 and MW2. I know that MW1 had dedicated servers and leaning sideways - it was a PC game. MW2 had none of those and I hear a lot of bad talk about grenadelaunchers aka noobtubes, although such talk is often way exaggerated.

Does MW2 have substantially more interesting things in it, like weapon customization?
Which one would you recommend?

Edit: You people all recommending to buy Blops2 sure aren't making this easier on me. In the end, I'll probably buy the newest one (some part of my brain has already decided to do so, although others are reluctant. They'll take a while to be convinced that ""60€ isn't that much anyways"" and ""If you're gonna spend 100+ hours having fun it's a good investment!"", things like that.

After some practice I've gotten decent at it. Not like I am with a m+kb but good enough to typically get MVP on tdm pretty regularly and occasionally get the hind. Anyways here are some of my thoughts on it. *The servers stink. It probably comes with the territory being p2p connections but being in the Midwest connecting to servers in Mexico or even on servers in America with spotty connection alot of the time does not make for a good experience. There really should be a filter game by region option. *I tended to mute anyone who spoke up on the mic. I have a mic but I didn't use it much. Most players just played annoying music, tried to troll or where jerkholes who thought they were the best players ever and would trash talk their own team. *The knife. I already hated knife melee but when you have the extra lag and less precision on console it makes it even more infuriating. Its not balanced and just lazy excuse of a melee solution. I hope that CoD Ghosts either takes out the knife melee altogether or emplements a buttstock melee (like CoD1,UO,2) or makes it more of a last resort option (like bc2)*The graphics were so bad. Maybe its because I play on my computer monitor so I'm closer and on a smaller screen so I notice more but the lines are so jagged, the textures fuzzy, and the details and shadows flat. I remember people thinking the graphics were really good at the time. I'd probably vomit if I saw bf3's graphics on PS3.So there I am, not trying to propagate the PC master race circlejerk because I will continue to play ps3 with my gf's brothers and I enjoy it, just thought I would bring out some points I gathered after my first week ",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,,True,t3_1epil8,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/1epil8/thoughts_after_my_first_week_on_ps3/,

I've never been a fan of the series due to lack of depth, it's not a bad thing, it's just not for me. The series has always felt 'arcade-y' for me. I'm more of a Battlefield player (inb4 BF vs CoD battle, that's not what this is.) CoD has always been jump-in-and-play with quick matches and not much incentive for non-voice-based teamwork (I understand with voice teamwork gets really strong in blops, I just can't stand using voice, and the game has no built-in incentive for 'natural synergy' like what Battlefield does with stuff like Suppression points, Squad Operation points, multi-man vehicles, etc.) which causes anyone not using voice to have their own agenda and it not feel very team-friendly.

I love Battlefield, but not because I just think it's better than CoD or anything, but because I prefer ""Grand-FPS"" to standard FPS. Kind of how I prefer ""Grand-Strategy"" to traditional RTS and TBS.

None of that is the point of this post, though, I'm getting to that.

I have found a new found love for Blops FFA, really blew my mind how much fun FFA is, and I hate FFA in any game ever, but when I first set foot in Nuketown with my M16 and 17 enemies, I was stuck. Ended up playing for a solid 8-10 hours the first day I recieved it.

Then I decided to try out some Zombies, which, to my surprise, has the most depth I've ever seen in a Call of Duty title. The sheer lengths the devs went through to make Zombies not feel like an after thought really blew my mind, and that was after I already had my mind blown by the awesome singleplayer main menu.

tl;dr I'm a CoD hating Battlefield player who has a new found love for Call of Duty: Black Ops through FFA and Zombies, and I might buy Modern Warfare 3, spending money for my first time on a series I've been so adamantly against.

You have the point of view of a unknown man. You Wake up, sit up straight in bed and looks down on your hands and they are old, wrinkly and full of scars. You`ve lived a though life. You get out of bed, moan a bit and walks over to the bedroom sink to freshen up. You look in to the mirror and realise that you are playing as Captain Price. But you look old. Realy old. At least 65. And he says something like : ""I better get a move on. To day is the day."" And the screen fades to black.

You meet up with a guy in a weelchair. He is even older than you are. More wrinkles and more scars. When you get over to him a green caption with the name ""Macmillan"" floats in front of him. He says: ""It`s been 10 years already? You still look like shit."" Price: “Right back at you old man.""

They enter a special forces cemetery (I dont know if it exists, but I know theres a special forces pub in Britain somewhere, so why not) And as they stroll past some of the graves they stop at the first one. It bears the name of Gaz.

The first mission with Gaz is a brief one. A hostage rescue in a Lebanon/Bosnia or Kosovo. In and out with a bang. Nothing more easy in the world. As they are extracted by Chinook, Captain Price says: “You`re alright kid.” To Gaz. The screen fades to black and the title “MODERN WARFARE 4: The Price legacy” shows in big letters.

And from there on we are constantly switching between present day, and the past as we participate in the events that introduced Price for the different people in the modern warfare trilogy.

Kamorov in Lebanon, Sandman in dessert storm when he was only a Ranger/AirCav/Green Beret/10th mountain/82nd Airborne or in some other badass branch of the US Military, When Price met Ghost while Ghost was still in the SAS, Walcroft, Nikolai, First mission with Macmillan, and all the other characters who Price has made friends or enemies with. And what action and/or what mission he did to get promoted from Lieutenant to Captain.

The last mission is a long one with some sneaking in the beginning and a lot of explosions in the end as usual. Gaz is also there. And you realize that Price and Gaz are starting to become really close. They know each other’s moves, reads each other’s body language and are extremely mission efficient together. You get extracted just barely as normal. And heads back to Hereford. As you land On the airfield in Hereford, Walcroft comes running towards you.

“We got a situation, sir. And you are the highest field commander on base.” You start running towards a hangar and when you get in you stand in front of some screens while Walcroft tells you about a situation in the Bering strait with a ship that`s containing nuclear missiles. Gaz starts to run the Kill-house obstacle course.

The hangar doors opens, Gaz says: “It`s the FNG, sir. They call him soap.” Price: “What the hell kind of name is Soap, eh? How'd a muppet like you pass selection?”

With a BANG the screen turns black and in big letters it says “THE END” which morphs into “THE BEGINNING” and the credits roll.

It is called EGL8, and it is being held in Manchester, UK, and it is the final and biggest LAN tournament being held for MW3. Since it is being held in the United Kingdom there are mostly European teams competing, but there are four North American teams there. They are OpTic Gaming (who are currently undefeated on LAN, and are back to back EGL champions winning ELG5 and EGL7), Leverage, apeX.TKO, and Team EnVyUs. Tomorrow is the 2nd and final day of the tournament and the competition will be great. 

You can check out the stream here and also the VOD of the event:

my dl speed was 6 meg and my upload speed was .3 meg.....

2 months ago i got fibre optic. 52 dl 7.2 upload. 

last night i was in a game on seatown with 2 people you may know, fear crads and i temp. although they didnt stay till the end i was actually beating them both kill wise and score wise. 

the difference a good connection makes is ridiculous. my kd is probably nearer 2 now than the 1.18 it has been for the 36 days game time i have played. i now feel the game has swung unfairly in my favour.

the host compensation thing sucks, i can now tell immediatly if i am host (just cant kill any one.)

2. Halo 3 had a big plastic helmet. again.. felt cheap. 
3. Skyrim had the dragon and the leather feeling art book, So far the only collectors edition I have been impressed with , the dragon looks cool artbook is full size and great quality.

Metallic art case for the game $10
Remote Controlled helicopter $30 (plastic helicopters go for 15-30$ Amazon)

So that is $117

WHY are they charging $180 for this??? Because people will pay for it..

EDIT - I've taken the liberty to weed through the answers and provide what I consider the best questions and answers set. There are a lot of TBA/TBD statements to some highly requested questions. You can find the original text and question set in the pastebin link below. I'll be editing that as well to streamline the reading.

[http://pastebin.com/NLfDvCT1](http://pastebin.com/NLfDvCT1)

One last note before we continue. A lot of information is going to be discussed and released this weekend during CODXP. 

    Platform Specific  
&gt; **Are any planned ELITE features incompatible with a privately rented dedicated server model for the PC platform? ** 
&gt;Since the PC is an open platform, our goal is to optimize the experience for PC fans while also protecting the need for secure data and statistics. We are committed to supporting the PC community and look forward to sharing more information soon. 

&gt;**What about wii players? Is Elite available for us?**
&gt; 
&gt;The Wii community is definitely one that we love because of their dedication. With the technical challenges that come with the online component of the Wii, we will not be able to include them at launch, but we are always looking for a good way to provide a great ELITE experience for Call of Duty players on every platform.  

    Downloadable Content
&gt;**Will ELITE paid subscribers gain access to DLC on all platforms or just on the one registered with the service?**
&gt; 
Right now, you will get the DLC on the platform that you purchased your premium membership with.  
&gt;**How long does someone have to be subscribed to elite to get the maps for free?**
&gt; 
&gt;While we haven’t yet announced specifics about how to people will receive DLC, you can expect that as a subscriber, no matter when you signed up, you will receive DLC content the moment it is made available.  

    Services  
 
&gt;**I would like to know exactly what kinds of new stats (if any) will be provided by the Elite service. For instance, I'd like to know my weapon and performance stats on specific maps. Perhaps KD and WL with specific perk combinations. Will similar stats be available?**
&gt; 
&gt;We’ve provided some initial demonstrations of our stat services in some of our early press coverage including the ability to review detailed information on all of your recent matches and recently played maps. Hopefully, you have seen the level of depth we are providing in the beta with Black Ops.  We are an ever evolving system and are always looking to the community to find out what our players want to know about. When Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 launches on November 8, we will have a whole new area of stats and leaderboards.  A lot of that information will be revealed at Call of Duty XP on September 2.
&gt; 
&gt;**Will the Call of Duty games (Black Ops, MW3, etc.) have any Elite-related functionality built-in such that players will be able to view &amp; interact with Elite directly from the game? From what I've seen so far, it looks like Elite integrates &amp; aggregates data from multiple sources (from Call of Duty matches, from users entering &amp; uploading data, etc.). For example, when I fire up a CoD game in my Xbox 360 console, will there be something like an Elite ""tab/blade/dashboard/etc."" in the game's menus/interface that provides some kind of view &amp; interaction with Elite? Or will players need to keep some separate web-enabled device running side-by-side to view &amp; interact with Elite while gaming?**
&gt; 
&gt; We are working on a console application for Elite and we are looking forward to showing it to everyone soon.  Call of Duty Elite is dedicated to being where ever you are, on the web, on mobile, in the game and with your console.
&gt; 
&gt; 
&gt;**I'm a casual gamer, so stats and heat maps don't really mean much to me. How will CoD Elite help me to become a better player and/or become more involved in the game? What can CoD Elite do to help a casual 'weekend warrior' become a better gamer?**
&gt; 
&gt;Call of Duty Elite’s goal is to provide something for everyone in the Call of Duty community. If you are a hardcore competitive gamer and want to analyze where on heat maps you can improve that is just as important as the players that want to get better and watch the videos about the different weapons or people that are looking to connect with other players who share the same interests. Call of Duty Elite is dedicated to bringing something to all of our Call of Duty players.
&gt; 
&gt;**Can you create private groups?**
&gt; 
&gt;Groups is a key function of Call of Duty and the ability to share things in a public domain. At Call of Duty XP we will talk more about what Clans will be and what they will offer to people looking for a key group of friends to play with.  

&gt;**Will there be competitions (either the beta or the full service in Nov) that cater to the gamer that has limited ability to play on certain days/times? For example, I usually only play from apx 10:00pm – 1:00am on any given night. Have you guys taken this into consideration and will there be events for guys like me?**
&gt; 
&gt;Yes, as a matter of fact we will soon be launching shorter Operations and competitions in the beta based on community input.   It’s important that we appeal to a wide range of gamers, including players with just evenings or weekends to play Call of Duty.   Additionally,  for those people who are really pressed for time, Events are also available.  You can enter a screenshot or video contest event where you only need to upload an in game screenshot or video clip.  We will also have Operations for best Kill/Death Ration and for highest Score Per Minute. There will be something for everyone in our Compete section.
&gt; 
&gt;** Will there be a separate place for zombie tracking?**
&gt; 
&gt;Great question.  The Zombies community is really dedicated. While we were working closely with Treyarch to capture a deep level of mp stats, we didn’t do the same for Zombies. We know how important co-op play was to people, so we have some of great things we are doing with Spec Ops for Modern Warfare 3. You should hear more about that at Call of Duty XP.  

    Privacy  
&gt;**Will there be an option to turn off the stat tracking abilities of elite if I decide I would not like my information tracked and I don't want it interacting with my matches?**
&gt; 
&gt;We haven’t made any announcements yet regarding the privacy of your stats and gameplay.  That said, we’ve had a number of similar inquiries. We are working with first parties to see what is feasible.
&gt; 
&gt;**As Elite could potentially hold a lot of detailed information about us via crossovers with facebook, twitter etc. What kind of privacy options and security will there be? For example; it seems apparent that there will be crossover leader boards between platforms so (forgive me if i'm being naive here) if PSN was hacked again could xbox users details be compromised as a result of this through Elite?**
&gt; 
&gt;All excellent questions.  Platform stats will not be intermingled with one another for a variety of reasons at this time.  However, we have a lot of hopes and plans for the future.  In terms of hacking and security, we recognize that this is an industry wide issue and one which is of the highest importance to us.  

    Miscellaneous  
&gt;**As elite directly ties into the game, and its obvious you can access game features whilst playing on elite (using phone to change classes for example) can we have absolute proof this wont impact on normal game traffic and cause undue stress on peoples connections?**
&gt; 
&gt;Great question.  You can expect all features of Elite that integrate directly into MW3 to be thoroughly tested.  Our goal is to provide the best service possible.  Doing anything to impact the gameplay runs 100% counter to our goal.  
&gt;**How will elite allow us to enhance an existing community, such as the Call of Duty fansites?**
&gt; 
&gt;There will always be a place for the Call of Duty fansites and we’re incredibly thankful for the enormous Call of Duty community that has been out there gathering on their own for years.  For those people loyal to their existing fansites, we hope that the services we provide on Elite, will help to enhance their current experience.  For example, a fansite can create a Group within Elite, and people who love that site can now congregate within Elite, compare stats, message each other, and set up games to play.  
&gt; 
&gt;**Will all aspects of COD Elite be available through a browser and in game or are certain elements of elite only available through the cod elite website or only available through in game interface?**
&gt;
&gt;Elite will be available on the web, smartphones, iphone, ipad, tablets and console (via a title app) this fall day-in-date with Modern Warfare 3.  Each one of these is customized to the capabilities of the platform, so we will endeavor to provide the features that make the most sense with each.  
&gt;**Will there be an API for COD Elite?**
&gt; 
&gt;We will not have an API for Call of Duty Elite at launch. We want to service the community directly and want to be in constant communication with those using the service and playing the games.

I can deal with the guys that lay in corners prone and such, but to have it that in your face and aggressive is annoying. When a player wants to go prone, make it that its a much longer process to stop drop shots.

2. Quick scopes. I know this is a unique skill and takes some work, but am I the only one that feels like this takes away the whole aspect of sniping? Snipers find a good position and hold it down, shooting from a distance...they dont run around a map and shoot guys for 5 feet away.

Forget the semi-random fights and the turn based system, I'm talking about the level up system.

In MW2, fighting gets you XP if you get a kill or if you assist. You can also get XP by doing objectives. All this adds to your overall level, and as you level up you can unlock perks and weapons. In Pokemon, your specific pokemon are like your weapons and perks. The more you use them, the more they level up. In pokemon they evolve and learn new attacks and in MW2, you unlock weapon attachments and pro level for perks, which is kind of like evolution. You can also get XP by doing objectives and stuff. Now of course Pokemon had a story and it was mostly single player, but that didn't have much to do with the level up system. In Pokemon you got more pokemon as you explored more and in MW2, you get new guns as you level up.

I think that this is why it works and this is why people it's addictive. Pokemon was very addictive and so is this.

What do you think?

For some players though, that was just a bit to easy. 

What I am proposing is a WoMD (Weapons of Mass Destruction) sub-category in the Create a Class menu. The WoMD sub-category would take the place of the generic Nuke that would be received after a 25 killstreak. In this subcategory, you could choose what WoMD you would like to be able to obtain after a long killstreak. For example, lets say that there were three WoMD to choose from (there could be more in the real game): a Nuke (kills everybody on the enemy team and ends the game), a set of heatseaking missiles (kills everybody on the enemy team, but does not end the game), and an Ion Cannon (kills everybody on the enemy team, rids them of any killstreak in their pocket, and EMP's them).

As you might tell, some WoMD are more powerfull than the other. Because of this, some WoMD's might require a higher killstreak to obtain. Maybe the WoMD sub-category would look like this:

Heatseakers (description): 20 gun kills

Nuke (description): EDIT: 38 gun kills

Ion Cannon (description): 35 gun kills

Maybe your not the best player, and you ask: what do I get out of this? Well, you will probably get hit by WoMD's less often, because the skilled players will be going for the higher WoMD's.

This is just an idea that randomly popped into my head and I thought it would be interesting to share. Be sure to tell me what you think about it.

This weekend, i won a code for DLC Collection 2 pack for MW3. 
Though i don't have it on PS3, i though maybe someone of you would like it.
I'm NOT sure if it is area-bound, the PSN codes (i'm from europe) so maybe it could not work for american redditors (can someone confirm this?)
Anyhow if you want to win it - Post here why you should get it (be creative!). Checking back tomorrow (+24h) at the same time so you all have a good time to think!
Cheers and i'll announce the winner here and send code via pm!!

While I honestly don't expect Treyarch to rock the boat too much in BLOPs 2, a guy can dream, can't he? Let's discuss some possible new perks, different from the usual crap.

Some random ideas I was thinking of:

* Alternate Melee perk (when this is selected, your character will smack people with the butt of his rifle instead of knifing. Doesn't insta-kill, like knifing, but will temporarily stun them)
* Long range bullet avoidance perk (when selected, other players have a harder time hitting you at long range...not sure how it'll work exactly - wouldn't want it to be OP - but the idea is that shotgun-users could equip this to let them close the distance easier on larger maps. Maybe it'd work by deactivating aim-assist for other players when they're ADSing on you)
* Grenade throwing perk (lets you throw grenades faster and/or farther...alternately, gives you the option of specifying throw strength i.e. longer button hold corresponds to farther throw, while tapping the button will just drop the grenade right where you are, etc)
* Anti-knife perk (at full health, this would let you survive a knife melee that would normally instakill)
* Higher jump perk (would be paired with certain spots on maps where you could pull yourself up onto ledges other players couldn't reach...there'd always be alternate ways around, so it wouldn't be OP or anything, but it'd give you a tactical advantage since you could take shortcuts essentially)

Our story begins with a dream a simple dream to improve the human condition to make us live longer better lives to heighten our senses to a near super level to make our lives as best and easy as possible. This is the dream of one Dr.Maxis, a German scientist who was the founder of group 935. 935 was a research group created to achieve the dream of improving the human condition it was independent, it wasn’t tied by any political ties it was unbiased diverse and above all home to some of the most intelligent minds in the world. Group 935 didn’t just hire you if you were German no they had German, British, America, Russian, Japanese, French members. Including one Dr.Edward Richtofen. Edward was the apprentice of Dr.Maxis and shadowed him for many years, aspiring to one day be head of group 935 and to be as intelligent as Maxis.
One of group 935’s projects was teleportation the scientists wanted to see if it was possible to transfer matter from one location to another. Up to the second world war this goal seemed impossible due to lack of funding and technology. 935 had bases all over the globe including the base in shi-no-numa, Area 51 and the der riece facility in Germany, but 935’s reach was further than any other organisation of its time, Griffon station was one of 935’s most acclaimed achievements a research facility on the moon.
A meteor crash landed just outside the perimeter of the shi-no-numa facility and was quickly brought in for samples and readings to be taken to 935’s amazement the rock code name 115 was giving off some kind of electromagnetic radiation 935 predicted that if harnessed correctly could control electrical bonds between atoms and help reach their goal of teleportation. Shi-no-numa was now used as a ware house to share out the element with other bases including griffon station.
Soon war broke out and the entire world was at each other’s throats, even group 935 was effected with members arguing about politics and who was right and wrong to be fighting and soon members stole planes equipment and knowledge and returned to their home countries those who stayed loyal however didn’t realise the depth of the problem, 935 was no short on everything funding equipment time and manpower in desperation Dr.Maxis turned to the richest power of the time, The Nazis.
Maxis had several secret meetings with the Reich command and came to an agreement 935 would be provided with everything it needed as long as it put all its research into weapons and ways to win the war although Maxis did not agree he had no choice he appointed Dr.Porter to create a weapon of supreme power. Porter was one of 935’s top weapon designers and using 115 created the ray gun the Nazi party were happy with the creation but desired more, Maxis then appointed Richtofen to alter the design and function of the ray gun to create something even more powerful. Despite he’s best efforts he could not do it nothing he done could make it any more powerful or deadly. It had seemed, he failed.
Richtofen approached Maxis several times on the sudden change of research being conducted. Maxis explained because he trusted Richtofen, although Richtofen didn’t like the idea of war he had no choice but to agree for keeping the secret he was allowed to continue in secret the teleportation research but was not allowed to produce results as the Nazi party would cut funding. After many failed experiments with and without element 155 Richtofen was able to transport a walnut 5 feet through a steel block using the teleportation devices on griffon station, he immediately informed Dr.Maxis begging to produce results. Maxis shunned the results and made a mockery of the experiments, this annoyed Richtofen and left him aiming for more he wanted to transport human.
Richtofen spent weeks re-calibrating the teleportation devices and when he thought it was ready for human test subject he offered himself as a lab rat. He powered up the machine, vanished, but didn’t re-appear for days. When he finally re-appeared he simply said ‘we have much work to do’.
He spoke stories of a cave were he found a black pyramid that spoke to him it had remarkable ancient symbols engraved around it and he wanted to open it everything he done was to open that pyramid. Soon the pyramid was brought to griffon station and upon someone touching it activated. A clear tube rose up from the corner and by mere coincidence a rat was found on the base because of contamination Richtofen order it to be killed and when it was something happened. Reports say ‘its soul left the body and was trapped in the tube’… Richtofen finally knew how to open it.
Meanwhile Maxis had recently been ordered to by the Nazi party to create spies so good no one would ever suspect them. At first Maxis tried normal German spy’s but found them to be ‘incompetent’ he then went on to use brainwashing on POW’s although it worked better the effects wore off quickly. He then turnt to brainwashing with help off 115. Maxis was given 3 test subjects an American a Russian and a Japanese when the results were reported back to the German high command the Nazis no longer wanted spy’s they wanted super solders the reports said that the test subjects physical condition had improved greatly and there ability in the field would be immense. The Nazi’s wanted every soldier to be like this because it was to be done on such a large scale the process had to be shortened and because the subjects did not need to be brainwashed the results were different each test subject showed heightened aggression and lack of cognitive functions and recognition basically it was angry didn’t know what it was doing and didn’t know who anyone was.
Early test subjects had to be ‘relieved of duty’ and the brainwashing was brought back into the formula in the verruct facility. The test subjects were given the dosage of 115 then ‘taught’ basic skills using shock therapy",,False,,t5_2rcq2,False,,,True,t3_objcl,http://www.reddit.com/r/CallOfDuty/comments/objcl/mytake_on_the_zombies_story_line/,

The only problem is that that's been done maybe too often, so how about alternate history?  Germany invades Britain in 1940, UK government/armed forces keep a perimeter to the North.  Germany then launches Barbarossa early and over stretches, fighting on two fronts.  Britain pushes back, and from early '41 to '43 pushes German forces back over the Channel, as the Eastern front really gets going.  British/Commonwealth/Resistance forces then launch an assault on Occupied Europe, pushing German forces back to the Reich, ending up just short of Berlin, 'cus the Soviets got there first.  Meanwhile, seeing Germany's conquests, the USA stays out of Europe, but is drawn into conflict with Japan.  Due to only having to fight on one front, the USA is able to quickly beat back the Japanese forces to the Japanese home islands, then invade before the A-bomb is developed, massive bloodshed, Tokyo, yadda-yadda.  It gives a chance for the CoD hallmarks (urban combat as the UK is cleared, a couple of beach landings, possible aircraft/vehicle missions, large scale mass engagements, chance to ponder the nature/scale of war, etc.) and given the way graphics and physics have advanced since WaW, should show off the environments and conflict pretty well.

Then of course, there'd be multiplayer (using Brit vs. German and US vs. Japanese teams) with the various weapon classes (could have a nice spread across the '40s, maybe getting later-war guns as you level up), killstreaks (using period and faction specific air support, ground vehicles, equipment and so on), nice scope for variety of maps (urban UK, Japanese beaches, northern European plains) and perks/attachments relevant to the era (gas mask, bayonette etc.).
