&gt; Hey guys. We actually allow people to subtract a level from a gem they're using. Just put the skill gem + an Orb of scouring up in the Vendor window, and you'll receive the same skill back minus one level.

&gt; We have a ton of improvements to the Gem UI coming in future patches. Ultimately, we'll allow you to see exactly what you're getting at the next level, with regard to mana and overall power increase. The current system is a fairly rough implementation that needs a lot of work.

I was thinking it would be really fun if there was a **crafting-only league**, where only white items dropped and currency items had a large increase in drop rates.

This would not eliminate the need for IIR or IIQ, because it would be important in order to find high value currency items.  I think it would be fun because some players (myself included) enjoy the secondary use of currency items (crafting) but are forced to use them to pay for upgrades via trading.

I would really enjoy this league-restriction because it would make the currency value system obsolete and the only value in currency items would come from their tooltip purpose based on what you need for crafting.  I also think it would serve as a good learning tool for players that wish to experiment with crafting without going broke or ruining the economy on SC or HC.  It may also be necessary to restrict trading between players in this league since currency transfers between leagues could occur.

Another important consideration would be how to deal with vendoring.  I think it would be best to have vendors only sell whites, but also sell multiple crafting items with the current exchange rates.  Maybe this wouldn't work though.  To make it simpler just have one of the vendors sell currency for crafting and the other sell whites.

What are some opinions on this?  I realize it is a pretty drastic change in the way people would farm for items, but I think it could be both a casual learning experience for crafting and a challenging experience for those that reach the endgame.  What balance issues would occur if this were implemented?  Personally, I would play the shit out of it.

**EDIT: TL;DR** - How about a league where only whites drop, currency (crafting) items have a large increase in drop rates, and perhaps trading is restricted?

**EDIT 2:** What if all items in your inventory where lost upon death but you still resurrected in the same league (not transferred to SC)? This would make it important to keep backup high iLvl white items.

**EDIT 3:** I was incorrect regarding IIR (thanks to tattertech for correction) - apparently white items and currency are not affected by it meaning it would need a modification to be useful in this league type.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1363890033.0,,,True,t3_1aqkc1,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1aqkc1/new_league_idea_craftsman/,

Here's why.,Ridley,548,91,408,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1a7b74/i_sold_poeexinfo_to_someone_else_heres_why/,"**TL;DR I sold poeex.info because it’s become too stressful. As much as I've tried to avoid it, poeex _IS_ the official currency table for Path of Exile and I feel like it's too much power for me. Also, GGG polices the shit out of RMT, but lets a mass multi-boxing exploit happen for over a week.**

Hi all,

This is the final post that I’ll make about www.poeex.info because as of this moment, I no longer control it. I’ve sold the site to a company who was very interested in taking it off my hands. If anything, this post should serve as a notice to minimize the amount of butthurt that comes my way due to (likely) changes.

For me, poeex isn't what it used to be and I no longer wish to deal with the stress that it has been causing me. I originally made the site for fun - for the lulz, as Kripp always says - because I felt that Path of Exile needed something like it. It was really fucking awesome. I posted about it on this subreddit several times and got a lot of great feedback. Everyone was giving me these amazing suggestions to improve it and I honestly felt like I was helping to strengthen the community. All of that has changed since open beta, however, and its become a hassle to maintain. Since then, most people are: constantly complaining rather than helping; constantly sending me hate mail; and constantly making me question any legitimate change I might want to make. Sure, I still get a lot of, “oh thanks man,” but after the 10th email from someone telling me that I should probably kill myself, it’s altogether a bit of a downer. I actually should have taken the time to post the angriest/stupidest email I've received - some real gold in there.

I don’t mean to sound like a bitch, but poeex is no longer the fun little project I was building. It’s something much more perverse. One redditor suggested that I make a public relations post apologizing to the players over the whole Chaos Orb thing that happened last week - explanation below - and what the fuck, a site I started for the lulz now needs public relations? Do people take this shit that seriously like I have to apologize to them just to get them to come back? LOL?

I could have never anticipated that it would become so influential - which is kind of cool, but also a huge source of stress for myself. I do not want to wield so much power. It’s a terrible feeling. Last week, someone who I had been working with decided (on a whim) that Chaos Orbs were worth double their value due to the recent game patch so he updated the table. (This is NOT how I told him to do things. Changes are decided 100% of the time through voting!) I understand that the game economy went batshit insane for about 30 minutes until I revoked his admin access and changed the values back. (Are people really that stupid?) During that time, I received almost 20 emails from players telling me what an idiot I am, some accusing me of trying to break the game and profiting off of it. I was at work in a meeting when all of this happened and didn’t know what was going on. I actually had to leave the meeting and fix it to stop the emails from coming!

Ultimately, the final decision to sell the site came when GGG decided to ban any mention of poeex from their forums for a week because I had posted an RMT advertisement. (I had originally put it up with the intention of making a little extra money, but after quite a bit of backlash, I decided that it wasn’t in the game’s best interest and took it down.) [A moderator then decided to use language which suggested to other players there was a link between the adverts and cracked accounts, ""We just slowed down from a huge spike in compromised accounts, and having a link to RMT trading readily available on a site frequently used by a lot of players, just seem to (sic) coincidental to me.""](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/211686/page/3#p1845220) What's more, said moderator insisted that the consensus of the community against the advertisement was reflected in the 35 PMs she had received - a whopping 0.2% of my traffic for the day. This made me quite angry, but whatever.

In my opinion, a slap on the wrist and a, “Okay you said sorry. Just don’t do it again,” would have been more than enough. I don’t have a record of pulling these kinds of stunts. People make mistakes. I realized that it was a mistake. It was done. Instead of that, I'm told that they're going to ""make an example of me"" LOL. Ironically, I then sold it to someone who (probably) doesn't give a care about all of this stuff and is (probably) going to post RMT ads; thus, making the problem worse.

And just as **GGG loses their shit over RMT**, some players were making [30+ Exalts in currency value per day off of multi-boxing](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/19bjtj/farming_guide_vaal_2030_chaoshour/) and that’s totally fine. [Apparently some of the mods are multi-boxing too!](http://i.imgur.com/AyJ6DNg.jpg) I’ve been playing this game pretty casually for around 7 months and I’ve probably accumulated about 10-20 Exalts worth of wealth. That's overshadowed by less than a days worth of work. “You can multibox, just don’t visit poeex. Wouldn’t want to give anyone an unfair advantage,” is what I hear in my head.

Anyway, I had a good a run. Bye bye.

**EDIT: Just a few follow up words:**

- Thanks for all the kind words.
- I should say that GGG losing their shit is more like some mods losing their, but it is the official website, so I can't say that GGG wasn't involved. That said, it wasn't apparently to me (ever) that Chris Wilson had his hands in any of this. I don't want to sour Chris' name because he is a total rad dude.
- If anyone is looking for the Ruby on Rails PoE project to work on, you should contact me. I have private github repos! If you're new to RoR, I can help you build a PoE site?
- I still love this game, don't get me wrong. Best ARPG ever?

**EDIT 2: [The same mod locked the thread I made about this on the forums.](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/252409/page/4) LOL** Talk about power hungry. Maybe I should have sold poeex to her?

----
**Difficulty levels**
----

There are three difficulty levels: Normal, Cruel, and Merciless. You must complete Normal difficulty before you can move to Cruel, and you must complete Cruel before you can move to Merciless.
The higher difficulties have death penalties, causing you to lose experience when you die. They are 0% for Normal (no penalty), 7.5% for Cruel and 15% for Merciless difficulty. This is a percentage of the experience needed to gain the next level, not your total experience.

Losing experience in this way cannot cause you to drop down a level. For instance if you have 11% progress to your next level and die in merciless difficulty, your progress will be reset to 0%.
There are also penalties to resistances in higher difficulty levels. In Cruel difficulty, there is a -20% penalty to player resistances, and this increases to -60% in Merciless.

----
**Skills**
----

**Skill Types**

Skills currently come in two main varieties: spells, and attack skills.
Any skill that uses your weapon damage counts as an attack skill, and everything else counts as a spell. 

**Attack skills**

Attack skills are dependent on your weapon, and so are affected by attack speed, accuracy, etc.. Bonus damage from rings and other gear is applied when using an attack skill.

**Spells**

Spells do not draw their damage from your weapon in any way. They are affected by % cast speed, %fire/cold/lightning damage, %spell damage, and critical strikes. Integer damage bonuses on gear are not added to spells.

**Traps**

Traps are very similar to spells, but are not affected by cast speed or spell damage mods. They are affected by % trap laying speed, and relevant damage mods. Integer damage bonuses on gear are not added to trap damage. 

The only exception to this is Town Portal, which is not affected by attack speed, cast speed, or anything else.

**Support Gems**

Support gems only affects skills where it makes sense. For instance, skills that do not already do damage (such asTemporal Chains) will not benefit from Added Cold Damage. Skills that do not already have an area of effect will not benefit from Increased Area of Effect, etc.

Skill gem experience gain

 * Gems get experience equal to 10% of the experience you earn.

 * The number of gems you have equipped has no effect on the rate of XP gain. So having less gems equipped does not cause them to gain XP faster than if you had many gems equipped.

 * Gems are not affected by the experience penalty when facing enemies below your level.

 * Gems do not lose experience when you die.

----
**Flasks**
----

Flasks come in four main varieties: life flasks, mana flasks, hybrid flasks, and utility flasks.

**Life, Mana, and Hybrid flasks**

These flasks cause you to regenerate life and/or mana when used. The amount recovered is shown on the flask as Life Recovery and Mana Recovery. The time it takes to recover the full amount is shown on the flask as Recovery Time. If you reach your maximum life and/or mana amount before the end of the recovery time, the flask effect will end prematurely. For example:

You are at 100/300 life, and 150/200 mana. You use a hybrid flask that has 400 Life Recovery, 200 Mana Recovery, and Recovery Time of 8 seconds. After 2 seconds, you will be at 200/300 life, and 200/200 mana, and the mana recovery effects ends. The life recovery continues, and at 4 seconds, you have reached maximum life, and the life recovery effect also ends.

Flasks can have magic modifiers that provide bonuses while the flask effect is active, for example increased movement speed or resistances. These bonuses end when the life/mana recovery effect ends.

When multiple flasks are used at the same time, the effects are queued. The effect with the highest regeneration rate is always applied first. For example:

You have two flasks, one that gives 500 life recovery over 10 seconds and has a 20% increased movement speed modifier, and a second that gives 500 life recovery of 5 seconds with no additional modifiers.
You use the first flask and gain the movement speed while recovering life. After one second, you use the second flask. At this point the remaining 9 seconds from the first flask is queued, and the second flask begins its effect. Once the second flask has expired, the first flask resumes its effect for the remaining duration.

**Utility Flasks**

These flasks give a temporary bonus for a set duration. Unlike the other flasks, the effects are not queued, each effect has its own timer that can overlap with other effects. The default effects of the flasks will not stack. For example:

You have a magic Granite Flask with +25% movement speed, and a regular Granite Flask, both giving +4000 armour for 4 seconds. You drink the first flask, and one second later you drink the second second flask. The result will be that for the first four seconds you will have +4000 armour and +25% movement speed. At the four second mark the first flask ends, but the second flask still has 1 second left. So you will have +4000 armour (but not the movement speed) for another 1 second.

**Flask Charges**

Drinking a flask consumes flask charges. Each flask shows how many charges are used per drink in its description, and each flask has a maximum number of charges it can hold.
Whenever you or one of your minions kills an enemy, all of your flasks gain charges.

By default regular monsters grant 1 charge each, magic (blue) monsters grant 3.5 charges each, and rare (yellow) monsters grant 6 charges each.

So killing a rare monster causes all of your flasks to gain 6 charges.

----
**Classes**
----

The main difference between the classes is their stating location on the passive skill tree. Classes also start with different amounts of attributes at level 1:

 * Marauder: 30 STR, 14 DEX, 14 INT

 * Ranger: 14 STR, 30 DEX, 14 INT

 * Witch: 14 STR, 14 DEX, 30 INT

 * Duelist: 22 STR, 22 DEX, 14 INT

 * Templar: 22 STR, 14 DEX, 22 INT

 * Shadow: 14 STR, 22 DEX, 22 INT

**Life/mana per level**

All classes begin with the same base stats, and gain the same amount per level:

 * 50 life, +6 per level

 * 40 mana, +4 per level

 * 50 evasion, +3 per level (including level 1)

**Attributes**

Attributes are required to equip gear and skills. The three attributes also grant some passive bonuses:

 * Strength grants +0.5 life and +0.2% melee physical damage per point

 * Dexterity grants +2 accuracy and +0.2% evasion per point

 * Intelligence grants +0.5 mana and +0.2% energy shield per point

Therefore the +10 attribute passive skills effectively grant:

 * +10 Strength: +5 life, +2% melee physical damage

 * +10 Dexterity: +20 accuracy, +2% evasion

 * +10 Intelligence: +5 mana, +2% energy shield

**Life and mana regeneration**

All classes have a base mana regeneration rate of 105% of their maximum mana per minute. For example, a character with 100 maximum mana will regenerate 105 mana per minute, or 1.75 mana per second.

""Increased Mana regeneration rate"" modifiers modify the base rate. For example, 20% Increased Mana regeneration rate would result in 105 * 1.2 = 126% per minute.

Characters do not begin with any life regeneration, but it is available from gear and passive skills.

The rate at which you gain life from life leech is 20% of maximum life per second. If you have 1000 maximum life, and leech 600 life with a single attack, it will take three seconds for that life to be applied to your current life. You always get the full amount of life leeched, although it may take time to be applied - if you leech a large amount of life during a battle, you may find that the life gain continues long after the battle is over. Similar to flasks, the life gain from leech will end if you reach maximum life.

The same is true for mana leech, although the rate is 12.5% of maximum mana per second.

1363281798.0,303,self.pathofexile,1aamgq,In light of recent events I've put together a simple currency tool based on user input.,rek,341,38,191,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1aamgq/in_light_of_recent_events_ive_put_together_a/,"TL;DR: http://exilestats.com/ex/ (UPDATE: you can also use http://exileex.com now)

I was disappointed to learn the fate of poeex yesterday, as I'm sure many of you were. Even though rates in this game are supposed to be dynamic I know that I and many other newer players appreciated the help getting started. 

Now I wake up to learn that not only is the old currency site running RMT ads but the entire site was sold presumably to an RMT website. This makes GGG upset, of course, but it also raises a huge conflict of interest. I can't think of anyone I'd less like to have as a huge influence on in-game prices.

**This is why I decided to add a currency system to ExileStats.** But before I get into how it actually works I want to make my a few things clear...

**Rule #1: Transparency.** I want everyone to know and see where suggested prices come from. The starting data is the standard accepted rates but as new votes come in the old ""fake"" prices will get replaced, I will not be voting myself. You will be able to see exactly how many people voted for various prices and how many people agree/disagree on a modification.

**Rule #2: There will be no advertising on my tool.** Not just no obnoxious advertising or RMT advertising: there will be zero advertising. Ever. I prefer to run all my pages this way but this tool in particular I feel needs to stay non-profit. Even if ExileStats needed to get an ad: no ad will ever exist on this tool.

**Rule #3: Big changes might need to be made.** I put this together in a matter of hours this morning and it should be considered a proof of concept. I'm always looking for new ideas or improvements - so if you like something, don't like something, or have any ideas please let me know. I'm not attached to any ideas besides these rules. 

**Who am I and why should you trust me?** If you're not familiar with AgendaStats, DiabloStats, or ExileStats then you have no clue who I am. I do all of my ""work"" (read: play) under my real name. If you want you can learn some basics about me and some of my projects on [EnjoyStats](http://enjoystats.com/), which is a site I just started putting together to organize some of my stuff. I'll save you the boredom and say I'm just a normal guy who likes stats and video games.

**Sooo...** Just [go click on things](http://exilestats.com/ex/) and let me know what you think! If I get more real votes I'll start adding more data to the details section (if you click on a rate it'll open a dialog box with a price chart, average vote, ability to vote, etc.).

1362779253.0,260,self.pathofexile,19xpk1,Suggestion: Add /players command to eliminate the incentive to multi-log characters,Zaorish9,320,60,172,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/19xpk1/suggestion_add_players_command_to_eliminate_the/,"Hi GGG,

Thanks for making such a wonderful game for free! I've already spent lots of time and EMTs on this game and I don't regret a minute of it. I expect I'll play and love it for a long time to come, no matter what changes are made.

I've noticed a growing trend towards seemingly non-intended player behavior that can be easily and simply fixed. I'll describe the (A) issue, (B) Why it needs a solution, and (C) one solution.
=============================================================

**A. The Issue:**

An increasing number of players, either because they prefer solo play, or simply want to farm more efficiently, will create 3-6 characters and then either (legitimately) park them in doorways while they clear zones, or (illegitimately) use input broadcasting to make them follow their main character and level them all at once.


**B. Why I Believe it Needs a Solution**

POE is an Action/RPG. The player controls a single hero character who, either alone or in a party, explores the land, fights monsters, builds skills, and finds treasure. There are plenty of unrealistic aspects to gameplay, magic being an obvious one, but they are all done to increase the fun and the tempo/pace of gameplay. *Except* for the above. There is no gameworld-related or gameplay style-related reason why multi-logging should be necessary or advantageous in play, and yet, due to the drop mechanics, it is. Put simply, it's a distinctly non-fun, non-gamey mechanic that provides a large advantage in the fun aspects of the game. [Specifically: I found that adding 2 characters to my main character while level from 1 to 35 increased my Chaos Orb drop rate from 1/10 hrs to 1/1 hr over a period of several days.)

I don't really understand the purpose of keeping it in this state. Is it to preserve the feeling of pride of those who discovered it? But it is common knowledge now. Is it to reward strategic, outside-the-box thinking? But why not move the strategy inside the gameplay than keep it outside the game? At this point, the people doing it are not lateral thinkers, they just heard about it from others.

Moreover, running mutliple clients for the same player puts unnecessary strain on the same number of servers, leading to slightly more desync issues for all players. In addition, it provides a game advantage with players who have more RAM/computing power.

**C. One Solution:**

If this was an illegitimate action, I believe that GGG would ban it or otherwise make it impossible. However, according to what I've read, GGG has said that it is legitimate. Therefore, why not make it simple? My proposed solution is: provide an ""Instance Difficulty Slider"" for solo players and party leaders that allows you to control the ""player-scaled difficulty/drop rate"" in an instance. This minimizes the non-gamey aspect of it: Instead of various 3rd party apps and endless Alt-Tabbing, you get 1 simple option. Problem solved.


**Summary**

With the current system, the game rewards people willing to spend time and effort doing a non-fun, non-gameplay-related exploit to achieve a very simple, fun gameplay goal: increased difficulty in exchange for an item quantity bonus. I submit that this isn't totally logical: If this is not intended as part of the game, it should be banned; if it is, it should be made simple to select so that players' fun can continue and increase.

=======================================================

**Appendix: Objections &amp; Responses**

* *This will make some players richer and other players poorer.* 

* Probably, but it will not change the balance that existed before: Players better able to handle higher difficulties will still be richer.

* *This will provide a disincentive to join a party.*

* I feel as though players do not primarily go multiplayer, in any video game, for the game rewards. They do it for the social aspect. Players who enjoy multiplayer games will continue to do it for the social aspect, if this suggestion is implemented. Players who prefer single player games will continue to play single player.
* In addition, there is already a strong disincentive to join a party: Less loot than solo play. As someone said below, each additional player over 1 = +50%, not 100% loot, so loot% per player in a party starts at 75% and decreases for each additional player, whereas solo gets 100%. Not only that, but in each party, the most skilled picker-upper will grab the majority of good items, again decreasing realized loot share for the average-skilled player.

* *This issue is really about the FFA loot system.*

* While I believe it is a slightly separate issue, and because I don't care as much about FFA as I play solo, I do agree that if you allowed the Party Leader to have control of exactly how FFA the loot is, 90% of the incentive for multi-logging would go away.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1362809530.0,,hardcore,True,t3_19xpk1,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/19xpk1/suggestion_add_players_command_to_eliminate_the/,

This really hurts our community because it turns players off from contributing. 

Remember we were all noobs at one time or another.

The first thing I want to say is that calling someone names for not knowing something **IS UNACCEPTABLE**. Bullying others should not be a part of this subreddit. Don't call someone an idiot, scrub, etc. just because they don't know something you do. It doesn't help them learn and it just teaches bad behavior to others. 

Lets all try to be a little more noob friendly. If someone doesn't understand something, don't call them an idiot or downvote them into oblivion. Try to explain it to them, or at least link them an explanation. 

**Example 1**

Newplayer: ""Hey guys I have this idea""

xXAngryredditor69420Xx: ""No. That idea is stupid and would ruin the game.""

No matter how bad the idea is, why not just say ""That idea wouldn't work well because ________""

**Example 2**

Newplayer: ""Can you guys take a look at my build, I have hit a wall at act 2 cruel""

YOLOelitistprickYOLO: ""That is because your build sucks. Reroll.""

That isn't helpful. The guy clearly already knows his build isn't great or he wouldn't be asking for help. Instead either ignore the thread or actually take the time to tell the guy what doesn't work in his build and what options he has for fixing it. 

**Conclusion**

Most people who say these nasty things are not trolls, but rather just having a bad day and accidentally take it out on others. I simply ask that you either avoid posting on those bad days, or make an effort to be conscious of the effect you have on others. 

**Sidenote**

There have also been some redditors who have been a 100% negative contribution to this subreddit. I will not call anyone out specifically but please, when you see this really nasty behavior downvote it immediately (or report it) so that we can make this a positive place to learn, discuss, and generally enjoy the company of the other exiled.

- Map progression now extends to area level 77.
- Maps which had the same level topologies as other maps now have their own new layouts.
- The Labyrinthine mod now provides a more consistent increase in maps and is comparable to the Massive mod on applicable maps.
- Some existing maps have had their bosses changed or reworked.
- Some recipes for upgrading maps produce a different map than they did previously.

**Balance Changes:**

- Fixed a bug where the Stun Threshold Reduction on Mortem Morsu was not limited to just attacks by that weapon.
- Fixed a server crash related to currency items.
- Fixed a server crash that would occur involving Bear Traps.
- If you have a full microtransaction stash and purchase an additional microtransaction, a new microtransaction tab will now be added. This currently only works if you are not logged into the game client at the time. The addition of microtransaction stashes while you are logged in will be fixed in a future patch.

Now, to start, I'll just say I love this game. What I love most about it is some of the truly unique twists on old design aspects of the ARPG series. For example, what GGG has done with leagues has taken Diablo 2's signature ladder feature and ran miles with it. Another great example is the trade system, where currencies have use to the character and aren't simply another stat to keep track of. These above examples are two great decisions in the games design that lead to a more complex and rewarding experience. 



On the other hand, we have some systems that almost defy logic. They are few in count, but I feel the greatest offender is that of the Maps system in this game. To sum it up, maps have somehow managed to become one of the most rewarding and most frustrating experiences this game has to offer. Unfortunately, in this case the drawbacks to the map system are so substantial that I have had to put the game on hold until something is done about them. Too much of their design is contradictory to what the developers were ultimately trying to accomplish.





To lay it out simply

What is great about maps:

1. **Extremely diverse.** One map can be a cakewalk, the next the enemies leave you on your toes. This makes them a very engaging endgame, unlike the usual substandard farm in most ARPGs.


2. **Extremely challenging, at the choice of the player.** You can choose to challenge yourself in this system, which is amazing really. I found myself explicitly attempting to roll a challenge for myself with the augmentation system on maps. It lead to a very rewarding experience


3. **More rewarding endgame play.** Because the content is level appropriate compared to the rest of act 3 it is much more appropriate for those few who have reached the highest level in the game. They find more appropriate loot for their level, and get better experience points as well.

Now, what is bad about maps:



1. **Getting maps outside of maps.** I understand you wanted people to trade maps around, but in all honesty this isn't happening at all. There is 0 market in trading maps because you are never guaranteed in sustaining them. Seriously, hardly anyone sells maps and even fewer buy them. It is just too heavily influenced in RNG to be worthwhile to trade them. To make it worse, once you reach levels 70+, if you ever run out of maps you are stuck farming act 3 areas which have **horrendous** drop rates for maps. I mean REALLY bad. It turns what would otherwise be an exciting and engaging endgame into a monotonous farm, no better than Diablo 3's really. To add to that issue...



2. **Map diversity on rolls is inherently killed.** Remember earlier how I mentioned I loved rolling challenging maps? Well, I realized I couldn't do that anymore because it made it impossible to sustain them. Basically, if I roll anything other than +30% quantity or increased area/mob densities, I can guarantee I will run out of maps *very* quickly. Hell, even the front page post where the guy has an insane map roll? He mentions not even getting a map from it... I know GGG wants us to challenge ourselves with these maps, they mentioned it in interviews with TB. The problem is, in its current design, we simply cannot do that because it kills the opportunity of sustaining the maps. It is inherently flawed and ultimately kills the diversity we can opt for when rolling maps.


3. **The engaging endgame is behind a frustrating RNG.** Again, this isn't really a post complaining about the farm. All ARPGs will have a farm. And maps themselves are AMAZING places to farm, because of the earlier mentioned diversity they offer. The problem is, the second you run dry, the farm is relegated to a few select Act 3 areas. Docks, Crematorium, Lunaris. You will be in any of these 3 places for hours on end at hopes of dropping a map. The endgame becomes such a monotonous and frustrating experience every time your maps run dry it really just makes you want to tear your hair out. Again, this is almost exactly the same issue Diablo 3 had, a monotonous farm. Only in Path of Exile, that farm has a *chance* at rewarding you with engaging content. Why should the engaging content be behind this wall of horrendously balanced RNG? It is honestly extremely frustrating.


4. **Leveled content isn't leveled and ultimately RNG.** I don't have any clue as to why this ended up as it did, as it is level 66 maps drop more than level 77, no matter what level you seem to be or the level of the map you seem to be running. Why are higher level characters forced to roll lower level content? While maps themselves still manage to be engaging, the pace of them slows to a crawl as you gain less and less experience from maps as you gain levels. It makes no sense... why are higher leveled characters penalized, being forced into running lower leveled content?

**So there we have it**. On one hand, maps are an extremely engaging and diverse endgame experience, that are unfortunately masked behind an extremely frustrating and monotonous endgame farm, and the thrill in rolling challenging maps is lost in hopes of avoiding being stuck with the horrendous farm. Maps result in being both a source of entertainment and immense frustration for anyone who has managed to reach late game. It *needs* addressed, otherwise the longevity of the game will ultimately suffer.

So enough complaining, how can this be fixed?

1. **Buff entry level map drops outside of maps** - this won't solve the problem of the farm outside of maps being ungoldy amounts of boring, but it should make it quicker so its more manageable and people aren't spending hours in docks with not a map to show... Don't worry about this affecting the market of maps, lets face the facts, there is no market for them as is. If anything this could only help stimulate their trade, as people won't fear trading away maps they can more easily replace.

2. **Stratify the drop rate of higher tier maps in subsequent tiered maps** - Having a level 66 map drop in a level 77 needs to stop as much as possible, *really*. Make it so, say, a level 68 map has a fairly decent chance to drop in a 67 level map, and a 66 map less likely too. This way there is some actual sense of progress to the map system. As it is, level 66 maps are too common in all level maps, this needs to change so higher-tiered characters have the opportunity to run content appropriate for them, so it feels less like a grind.

3. **Give us an area to farm maps outside of maps that has more diversity** - I never played Closed Beta, but I heard about a maelstrom? I have no clue what it did, but for the love of god anything is better than running docks over and over again. If we could have some of the same diversity that maps have, without the augmented rolls perhaps, it could save the grind to get more maps from being ungodly amounts of boring and repetition.




Until any number of the mentioned issues are resolved I have personally put this game on standby, its a beta so I do hope this feedback gets through to help improve the game, as betas are intended for. Simply put, the endgame design as is is terrible, being stuck in docks for hours praying for a map to drop, getting one, rolling the same rolls to get more maps, only to not get them and be stuck back in docks for hours.... I know I am not the only one that feels this way nor experienced this very issue. 

Once this issue is fixed though, I'm going to jump right back into this game for sure. If anyone has anything else to add, like ideas for improvement or their own personal experience with this system, I'd love to hear them.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1361403577.0,,,True,t3_18wr49,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/18wr49/maps_a_dichotomy_in_game_design/,

Those locations change their level AFTER you kill Merciless Piety.

This way it does not affect the difficulty for those who did not finish the game yet.

This also will allow to switch it off when Act 4 is rolled out.

And this trick can be used for other new Acts as well.

* HAVE FUN and don’t worry if you’re using the best or most optimal builds! The game is designed for you to create multiple characters and explore different item and skill combinations. Your first character is almost guaranteed to suck. So go with it and just enjoy the ride.

* Pick an AOE skill early on and USE it! You can thank me when you’re not 30 levels behind everyone else.

* To link an item in chat hold control + alt and then click the item.

* You can use ANY gem as ANY class as long as you meet the stat requirements

* Some reasons to not level up a skill gem – the mana cost of the upgraded skill may become too prohibitive or you may not have the stats required to use the upgraded skill gem.

* Control + click an instance allows you to reset that instance. Useful for farming.

* Empty instances are reset after 15 minutes. Keep those town-runs quick, and if you need to be AFK for longer periods of time do so in a safe part of the instance and not in town.

* If you die in hardcore your character will be moved to the regular(softcore) league and you can continue playing them there.

* Exalted Orbs, Divine Orbs, Gem Cutters Prisms, and Chaos Orbs are the most valuable currency. Best bet is to hoard everything until you get a good understanding of values in this game.

* White items can be insanely valuable. This is because some of the best items in the game can be crafted from a white item using the aforementioned currencies. Example: Find a high base quality white weapon. Increase its quality by +20% using Blacksmith’s Whetstones(a currency item), then use an Orb of Alchemy on the item to make it a rare!

* Pick up: all currency items, quality skill gems(hover over the gem, if it has a Quality bonus, no matter how  small, pick it up), uniques(duh), items with three color links(ex. red, blue, green socket linked together, these vendor for chromatic orbs, a valuable currency item).

* White items to keep a lookout for – any item with 5+ links, 5+ link items are very rare and can be sold/upgraded well. And of course three color link items.

* Dual wielding grants +10% increased attack speed and +15% increased block chance

* There are now three acts with three difficulty types(normal, cruel, and merciless). Pretty much normal, hell, inferno. Each increase in difficulty and act makes the game noticeably more difficult. In cruel your resists are reduced by 20% and in Merciless your resists are reduced by 60%.

* You need elemental resistances. An easy way to build up resists is through rings. It’s a good idea to carry around different sets of resist rings and swap them out depending on the mobs you encounter.

* Path of Exile can be unforgiving for those who neglect defenses(like elemental resistances). Sure you  could make a full glass cannon build. But, would I advise that? Absolutely not.

* Be sure to pick up over +100% life or energy shield from your passive skill tree(cumulative from +8% and +20% nodes, there isn't one single gigantic +100% node to clarify).

* When making new builds plan for about 80-85 skill points. No need to get all crazy with a 120 point build. By the time you have 80-85 points you’ll have a much better understanding of where the skill points should be going. Also, this keeps your head from exploding.

* Look out for puncture. This is a skill enemies use that does five times more damage while you are moving. You are effected by puncture if you’re leaving a giant trail of blood behind you, and you HP is dropping like a rock.

* Don’t know how to build your character? Check out the official path of exile forums for ideas.

* You can join other player’s games by visiting the message-board in town. Friends who slay together, stay together!

* AURAS. Put your aura spells in gear set II if you don't intend on using gear set II otherwise. Frees up space on your hotkeys for all your explodey needs. - EtheralScorpions

* Weapons/shields equipped in your secondary weapon/shield set (you can swap between 2) can be used to level up skill gems, though you can't cast them when those weapons aren't equipped. - Shopshopshop

It's super fast to get through the first three difficulties, after which you end up with not anywhere enough in value to buy anything remotely close to 'end-game'. So you have to either not play the game at all and play the forums and trade to make money (Just like the AH in D3) or you can farm for hundreds upon hundreds of hours in hopes you get lucky and strike it rich, while slowly stockpiling items and currency in hopes to buy a few upgrades. 95% of players never find that Kaoms, Mirror, or Mega-Weapon, and  eventually re-roll to farm more currency and try to improve themselves with a better build or character or suffer through with an underpowered character.

* The (SC) Economy is inflating so fast you can leave for 5 days and come back and get insulted for 'not knowing the rates' that were applicable before you left. Exalts are becoming stupidly overvalued and the entire system is set up just like D3, where the rich get richer and the poor get left behind. This causes people to leave, GGG, and you don't want that. 

* Some people just like playing alone. They don't want to have to interact with people to play the game and all of it's content. There are lots and lots of asshats and fuckwads that I'd rather not be forced to go through to enjoy the game. 

I'd go apeshit over a league where no trading was allowed, and Item Quantity and Rarity was increased 100% so that you could actually find items. One of the biggest problems D3 had was the over inflated sense of hope you had from viewing the AH. When you saw 46 Pages of IK Chests, then you could never find anything yourself, it deflated your desire to play and causes a lot of people to get bored and leave. Though it isn't as bad as  D3, POE suffers from that, too, when you see chats and forums full of Lioneyes and Kaoms. 

Mainly, I think you have to understand that not everybody here cares about or wants to compete. They just love the game and love the underdog success story that is GGG and PoE, and want it to succeed. I mean, believe it or not, I enjoy the whole ""Killing endless waves of monsters and finding loot"" part of the game, and I don't really care about other people's big dick contests. I enjoy **using** currency items more than I enjoy having to trade them, and crafting a good item is a great feeling. I haven't found an upgrade from a drop on my current character, who is at 71, since Normal difficulty. That's just a horribly deflating ordeal. I know I can't be alone here. Let everybody else compete until their tits fall off. I just really would love and appreciate a way to enjoy the game that didn't involve all of that.

Today I've been invited to become a moderator and I'd just like to hear your thoughts before I accept/reject the invitation.

The Good Stuff:

- I already spend a lot of time in this sub each day, the 1hr a day requirement is really not too much of an issue for me. I work at home full time (YouTube/Writing/Website stuff).
- I am a moderator of another sub already so I know how it works (mostly).
- I love this game and community, I foresee it being a huge part of my life for the next decade. (Despite the vocal minority I definitely don't do what I do for the money, I do what I do because it allows me to just barely scrape by while doing something I love).

- I'm a fan of free speech and a light guiding hand when it comes to moderation. Sometimes things have to be done for the greater good (like disabling meme posts) but overall I'm happy to let the majority determine what posts they want the subbreddit to consist of.

My Concerns:

- I occasionally post my own content here. Some might see this as a conflict of interest and there is the possibility that people would feel I was using moderator 'privileges' for personal gain.

- Possibility of me attracting drama. This is very uncommon for me but as anyone who ever does any sort of streaming or YouTubing will tell you - sometimes you just get people who hate you and want to cause drama around you. A few weeks ago one post I made had the comments filled with one person posting about hatred of me and what I do for a living. As I said, it's not very common at all but there is always the possibility of it happening. 

So, I would love to hear your thoughts on all of this, knowing my concerns. Would you like to see me as a moderator of this sub?

Follow up probing question: What do you feel a moderator should do/be? (could range from nothing/spam deletion to /r/askscience strict enforcement).

I may go and have a sleep, but I'll check back here soon. Cheers! 

Edit: back! Thanks for the responses so far. To those downvoting: you only get your thoughts/opinions across if you actually write a comment! So far most people are saying similar things but being downvoted by other people (who aren't posting as to why). If you disagree you should voice your opinion, that's what reddit should be about.

**UPDATE: I've decided to go ahead with it, if there are any major issues down the line or if moderating ends up taking too much time out of my schedule to be sustainable then I can always remove myself from modship.  A few people suggested making a second reddit account to mod, I've decided to just stick with the one as it will be simpler to manage. I also don't think a second account would prevent any concerns about the relationship between my content and moderating anyway. Thanks a lot for the feedback everyone!**",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1365507157.0,,,True,t3_1bz51w,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1bz51w/ive_been_invited_to_moderate_rpathofexile_would/,

This includes being able do dodge attacks manually instead of relying on dice rolls. I very much enjoy active gameplay and therefore have built a character with relatively weak defences but good mobility. I play him in the default league where a few deaths don't matter too much.

This generally works out very well, I use whirling blades to disengage and wait for my energy shield to fill up again before I re-engage. In the long run I want to get a lot of life-leech in combination with ghost reaver.

But in the last 30 minutes I died 5 times. None of those deaths was a direct playing mistake by me. All 5 times I disengaged using whirling blades before my energy shield was fully depleted, only to receive several damaging hits while being out of range of all enemies, two times I actually was behind a wall when I died. I had no DoTs on me and I often saw the melee attack animations of the enemies that hit me, of course they actually only hit the air far away from me.

I completely understand that the game is still in beta and I do believe that GGG is aware of the desync issues (which seem to be more pronounced when using whirling blades). With this thread I simply want to underline the importance of fixing these problems. Should it turn out that the desync is an issue of the underlying netcode that can not be fixed easily, a lot of character builds are completely impossible in my opinion.

For me, there is nothing more frustrating than an unfair death and I hope GGG has the desync as their #1 priority to fix.

What are your experiences with twitch-based characters that manually dodge damage? Is anyone using whirling blades on a hardcore character? How important are the desync issues for your daily dose of PoE?",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,,True,t3_18n2me,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/18n2me/severity_of_the_desync_issues/,

I have added the most upvoted and recent ideas to the top 14. I am still awaiting to hear back from a GGG representative. Does anyone have any recommendations for a website that will allow for a free survey to take place, to get an idea of what the community wants? Please message here or PM me!

**UPDATE**

**Hi again /r/pathofexile!**

**Thank you so much for all of your amazing feedback. I think the list below outlines what the top 9 most popular ideas are so far. I will be leaving this post up overnight, and once again check the upvotes for what the community considers the best ideas.**

**There are two options to how we proceed from here:**

**1) As stated above, host a vote on a third party site for the top 9. Following this, take the top three, and hold a second vote to make sure this really is the option that is favoured by most of the community (unless there is a landslide victory for a particular choice. Following this, we will have a second thread where the community can debate the various pros/cons of the stats, as well as the flavour. Please keep in mind I am still not 100% sure about what exactly we will have the options of, a lot of it depends on GGG's response to this idea.**

**2) /u/grundir has thrown the idea of putting forward his diamond support as well. This means we could potentially try and work in two items that are related to each other. I will be messaging him shortly to discuss, but a big thank you to him as well for making such a generous offer.**

**Please keep your eyes open for updates and a follow up thread sometime tomorrow morning (Eastern Standard Time).**

Hi all,

The idea for this thread originated with /u/beagley, a self-post currently residing on the [front page](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17hhoo/reddit_custom_item/).

In this thread, I offered to use my diamond supporter reward as an opportunity to allow the Reddit PoE community to design a unique in-game item, and received a lot of positive feedback.

Before I go any further, here is proof of my diamond support for any doubters: http://i.imgur.com/JpKoS0v.png

Further, here is a copy of an e-mail I just sent to Chris:

&gt; Hi Chris,

&gt; http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17hhoo/reddit_custom_item/

&gt; I have decided to use my custom item design to do a Reddit community designed piece of equipment. I know you are extremely busy, but I was hoping you could indicate for me what options we as a community could possibly choose in terms of item type, colour, appearance, effects, text, etc., and whether if, in the credits, we could be credited as ""The Reddit Community"". Also, if there are any limitations in terms of the item design. I personally think this would be a great opportunity to get some of the playerbase actively involved in a really cool opportunity.

&gt; My reddit username is BabrahamDinkin (same as my PoE account name).

&gt; Please advise and let me know what you think.

&gt; Thank you for your time,
&gt; (Redacted)

It is my understanding that there is quite a delay in the e-mail boxes of the GGG staff, so if there are any Diamond members active on Reddit who have already designed their items, please let us know of your experience here.

I would once again like to thank /u/beagley for posting a great idea. Any thoughts or input would be greatly appreciated!

* I think saying /r/pathofexile in the credits, rather than the entirety of Reddit would be more fitting, it'd also likely generate more subscribers here. -/u/Smashman2004


**Item Suggestions So Far**


**1) Reddit Helm** (Needs a name) /u/shadowclaimer

&gt; From the other thread we had discussed the idea for a Unique helmet to represent the community and how much we help each other.

&gt; Effectively the Helmet would be based on the Gladiator Casque (Level 18), be White with Red around the eyes. It'd have a Unique Level of 18-20.

&gt; Stats it would have:

&gt; Increased Armor (Its ""scaling"" stat)

&gt; Maximum Life

&gt; Life Regeneration

&gt; Other Party Members get +10% Experience

&gt; Conduit (Share Charges with Party Members)

**2) ohbi idea (Needs a name)** /u/ohbi

&gt; I was thinking of something similar in idea Facebreakers with the quirky side of things, with a quick example of a mechanic would be to come up with a way for a empty handed caster melee, cast speed = attack speed, % of mana = % dmg bonus. Obviously that idea would need padding out properly, but thats the area I was thinking.

**3) Staff of Consensus** /u/alrightandrew

&gt; My contribution: ""The Staff of Consensus."" A staff with maybe the ends looking subtly like arrows? As for unique effect: increases attack power at full health, increases block/armour at low health

Been using PoE as a testing image on a 360 degree, 5 projector, 32 speaker screen setup at work.  Figured some of you might get a kick out of it.  Will try and post more pictures later on.  The game does the typical shearing or warping at the extremes, but looks pretty epic so large. 

This is only about 1/3 of the screen that you can see. The hardest part is that my health/mana/skill/inventory screens are all behind my head, on the extremities of the screen hehe.

edit: recent additions

* I've added a feature for sellers, where you can list your shops and be sure they will be indexed :)

* Added a ""Verify this item"" button, so that you don't have to dig through tons of items on the forums to make sure it's still verified. If it's not verified, then the item will disappear from the next searches.

UPDATE! I updated the site today with the ability to sort the results. I also added min-max required level fields. A lot more items indexed as well.

Yep, another search engine for Path of Exile! I liked the other 2 (poe.xyz and poetools), but I also thought they could be improved in a lot of ways (speed, display of the sockets, facetted search etc...). So I tried to do better, and that's what I came up with!

A few things I like about it:

* display the sockets like in the game
* can search only for verified objects
* can search for as many mods as you want
* facetted search

Have fun finding OP items :)

When WoW came out, it not only revolutionised the MMO genre with an injection of new ideas, it refined the old ones that still worked, making them better. Nothing was taken for granted; bold progress was made because the devs questioned everything, and made decisions based on their vision of the game, not just what players were comfortable with already. That's probably why the MMO genre increased in size by an order of magnitude within a few short years. 

I know that this subreddit has had plenty of GGG / PoE praise threads in the past week or two, but despite what it may look like, that's not all this is. When I play PoE, when I look at its passive tree, or currency system, or skill gem dynamics, I'm reminded of the same feeling I had when playing WoW the first time. It's not just one of enjoyment, it's one of anticipation, because there's so much in the game to look forward to. Because there's so much potential in the days and weeks and months and years ahead. I know that I've barely scratched the surface of what this game has to offer. 

Path of Exile *is* a good game. I don't think that's a particularly new or controversial notion in this subreddit. But what really makes me excited is what it *will be* -- a great game. So while I've enjoyed the past two weeks immensely, what I'm enjoying even more is looking down the road at what will no doubt become an exceptional game.

One more remembrance, if you'll indulge me. The first two weeks of WoW's launch were abysmal. For the first few days, the lag was unbearable. It would literally take upwards of ten minutes to loot a single item from a corpse. After that came the queues. 1-2 hours at peak times, if you were lucky. People were calling spouses / siblings / room mates to log them on, an hour before they'd even left work. Even if you did get on, your time was spent playing with your fingers crossed, hoping that the servers wouldn't crash. All while Blizzard scrambled frantically to get enough hardware in place to cope with the unanticipated demand. And yet, people stayed on. Not because the game *was* good. But because the game *was going to be* good. And in that spirit, I hope you'll all join me during this downtime to marvel at everything that this game is *going to be.*",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,,True,t3_17xb8h,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17xb8h/i_havent_enjoyed_a_game_this_much_since_wows/,

I understand that no one is entitle to the items. The timer solely exists to give ranged players a chance to reach it.

But character models colliding with each other makes it ridiculous. How many times have you clicked on an item and your character stopped walking halfway there because he bumped into someone else? I'm not even slow at reacting, I'm always at my designated items with time to spare, but collision and other nonsense is just making this stupid. There is no fun in a clunky system.

I suppose solutions would be as follows:

-Increase the range to loot an item.

-Make it so we can walk through each other. Maybe this would allow for unfair tactics or something. I don't know. Someone should point out why we should not be able to walk through each other.

I emailed Chris directly and after a bug report and a few exchanges his final reply was:

&gt;Hi *******,

&gt;I have good news and bad news. **The good news is that the bug has been found and a fix will be in the next patch. It turned out to be a very rare level generation problem with that area.**

&gt;The bad news is that because this appears to have been happening for quite some time (quite rarely), we're unable to replace the map without it being unfair to all the other people it has happened to. We have never actually replaced items due to game bugs before for any reason, and after a lot of discussion, we're not able to start doing it here. I'm really sorry about this - but thanks very much for the report and for helping us track down the problem. It was very helpful.

&gt;Kind regards,

&gt;Chris

So, even though it's a very rare glitch, I recommend waiting before using those unique maps (specifically ""Maelstrom of Chaos"").

Understandably I won't have a map returned, which is a bummer, but at the very least I may have saved a few of you losing yours as well.

* New skills (melee has a priority here I believe).

**Info:**
Lots of my friends have been struggling getting to higher quality and higher level maps so I thought I'd make this thread to help out the people new to maps. I have been doing 70-76 maps for a while now, and thought this would be doing a good idea since i have TONS of 69 maps sitting in the stash that will NEVER be used. I know what it's like prepatch to never get above 68 maps and grind 'teh mud geyzors'.  I want everyone to be able to experience  end end game goodness and that thrill of getting a 71+ map drop and going ""oh man I wonder what tile set that uses, or what new boss contains"".

**First of all let me prove to you this offer is legit.**

**My stats**: http://imgur.com/1PyoHv1  (this is before disc aura, afterwards my mana gets close to 2k)

**Maps that I will run you through** (the 69's that I don't use) - Look under the MAPS tab:  http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/140674

I can carry you through any lvl map from 66-77, with only reflect damage being the map mod I won't do.  

You don't even have to dps.  You can sit back and watch the happy loots rain down around you.  **You get ALL LOOT!!! Every yellow or unique or QGEM that drops is yours.**

If I am speed running you, I can clear a 69 map in around **5 minutes or less**, depending on the map. (this is not a guarantee, lol)

**Map drops within maps**: Map drops to maker so I can keep doing this service for people. However I often give smaller groups the maps that drop, at the end of the runs if more than 1 drops ^_^.

**Cost: Free. Fur. Sure?!?** :  Nothing. For Redditors, I will rush you through maps and IF YOU WANT after a great run, you can throw me a chisel or maybe a shard of awesomeness for ups! If you can't afford, no big deal, the currency is mostly just to sustain the map pool i have for future new POE players and the bunch of people that added me that i am working hard to queue up and run with.  If you are lvl 60-80 you will get amazing experience gain/hour.  I hope this is fair to everyone =)

Thanks! (Have vent server/skype if needed).

**EDIT**:  ALSO can run your maps if you want, you get everything. Everything.

**EDIT 2**: Can also do lower lvl (66-67 maps) for people lvl 60-mid/high 70's.  Lower levels benefit more experience-wise from running 67-66 first before they hit 80.

**EdIT 3** : Due to the amount of whispers (one every 5-10 minutes from a new person haha I have decided the best way for everyone to get the fastest exp/loot/hour is to limit groups to 3 people.  This way I can still 2-3 shot mobs and  you get much bigger portion of loot.  I am always down for suggestions though!!  If I am not responding just add me and keep reminding me to run you.  Thanks!

**Right Now**: As of this edit, (7:30 PM CST) 3/26 I am messing about in game and will be going to work soon.  Only have one 55 min class to teach today so I will be home shortly.  Will be ready to do map runs in 3 hours (10:30 PM CST) **

Also changed price to : **PAY WHATEVER YOU WANT** I am only asking because you must realize that even for lvl 66-67 maps I use at least 1 trans, 6-8 alts for the group I am running.

I know this sounds obvious, but I am just now discovering this on my level 69 summoner.

I have been using Queen's Decree (2-hand sword) for the longest time so there is no point for me to use normal attacks (or so I thought). 

I used to simply position myself (dangerously) such that my following minions would attack enemies near me. This has the obvious disadvantage of having to get in close proximity of enemies. This is very dangerous as a summoner.

By simply holding shift and clicking enemies from afar I'm able to get my minion army attacking things without having to get dangerously close to them.

So if you see some summoner standing in the back swinging his sword wildly at the air, cut him some slack. He didn't just go full retard, he's actually playing effectively.

My problem was that I was on top of the thing, protecting my loot, dpsing but still positioning, and I still lost it because the game/latency/desync wouldn't let me pick it up.

This makes it hard for them to get a good trade for themselves as well as annoying other players with their trade chat spam. Some tips:


-If you are looking for gear, at least mention your level. The more specific you are the more likely someone is to have a good trade for you. It also helps to mention what you are willing to trade.

BAD: ""WTB bow ranger gear""

GOOD: ""WTB lvl 30 elemental bow, offering alc""


-Currency is just that. Don't say you want to sell a divine orb, tell us what you want to buy and that you have a divine for trade. ""WTS x currency"" makes as much sense as ""WTS a $5 bill""

BAD: ""WTS regal orb

GOOD: ""WTB 10%+ quality lightning strike for regal orb""


-If you're selling quality spell gems, type out the %. There's no way to tell they are quality without opening the trade window and mousing over them, so if you don't mention the quality, someone who would be interested might not bother checking.


-Don't spam. Especially if you are looking for a fairly rare item like a quality gem. If someone didn't have it 30 seconds ago, odds are no one is going to have it now and you're just going to get yourself muted by a lot of players, making it harder to find trades in the future.


-Get an idea of the values of various currency. It'll save you from getting ripped off or wasting time with unreasonable offers. [Here's](http://www.poeex.info/) a reference. It's not completely accurate right now since the game is young and certain currencies that are only really used end game like exalted and gcps are valued lower, but it'll give you some idea.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1359332492.0,,,True,t3_17eavd,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17eavd/dont_be_a_trade_chat_newb_some_tips/,

I have been playing Path of Exile quite a bit since it went into open beta. I just realized there is a subreddit today and I figured I would make a post that hopefully helps people. These are all things you will eventually learn along the way, but it will be much more helpful early on.

----------------------------

**Quest/Leveling Tips**

* To reset instances so you can get new monsters spawns in the same place... hold ctrl+left click on mouse. This works for either the doorway to the zone or the way point node. You get a new popup window, just select ""New"".

* When you get to Bandit mission if you kill all 3 you get +1 passive skill bonus when you turn in the quest at town.

* The 2 most popular grind spots are ""Ledge"" in act 1, ""Fellshrine Ruins"" in Act 2 and ""Docks"" in act 3. Try to look for non stop xp grind groups in these areas for quick xp.

* Try to keep the group full and have all your members in same instance at same time. This enhances the speed and the xp bonus. 

* There is also 3+1 levels of difficulty in this game. Normal, Cruel, Merciless. The last type is maps which can be random levels depending on where you got them or crafted them.

-------------------

**Skill Passive Help**

* You do get quite a bit of respec points to refund mistakes as you quest. Do not fear the Skill forest! I still recommend everyone gets a solid game plan of the skill clusters they want to aim for early on, but you can respec out mistakes.

* Here is a link to the skill tree planner... this is great place to avoid mistake and figure out a game plan. 

http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgMB

* Another tip is if you need to spec a few points into stats that are not primary for your class, but you need them for end game gear. I recommend you avoid the single little +10 nodes. If you happen to expose +30 nodes (don't go out of your way for them unless you have a gameplan), but if a +30 dex/str/int node is in reach and you need some points for gear.. this is ideal! You are only wasting 1 point instead of 3.

* Orbs of Respec. These are a currency items that also help give 1 respec refund point for each use. Have no fear of mistakes, there is way to reverse them. Just do your best to minimize them since they can become expensive. 

* Lastly, as long as a skill link is connected to another location you can actually refund points to break an old pathway (you just have to connect a bridge pathway from somewhere else 1st).

&gt; Below are 3 examples in progression to demonstrate examples of this point. 

&gt; [Example one](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgMAVytUrn3SIvRrF20ZLR9Ms1Aw217r5F8qfM50VQD9FLA6MDlSvDdObVgH) Let's say this is the starting point and I made a mistake.

&gt; I want to remove all the nodes I took on the right hand side leading up to the top, but I still want to keep all the skill I took at the top. In order to do that you need to first build a skill bridge from some place else, like this [Example two](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgMAVytUrn3SIvRrF20ZLR9Ms1Aw217r5F8qfM50VQD9FLA6MDlSvDdObVgH37CCEAelAuNJsiycVa5Eq4-m)

&gt; Now I can effectively refund out all the points on the right side leading up to the new connection point like in [Example Three](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgMALR9Ms1Aw217r5F8qfM50VQD9FLA6MDlSvDdObVgH37CCEAelAuNJsiycVa5Eq4-m)

---------------

**Skill Tips**

There are 2 types of gems in this game, the actual skill gem and gems called support gems which enhance certain skill gems when slots in a ""linked"" item with them. Not all support gems effect all spell gems. It is best to check wiki to verify which gems effect which. Another way to verify that a support gem enhances a skill gem is by looking for the little letters that show up on the upper right hand side of the skill. If you see a letter(s) there then it effects it.

Another tip is about Gem quality, quality on gems makes them better. All skill gems can have a maximum of 20% quality. The quality has different effects depending in the skill (again look up what the quality effects on the wiki). The way to enhance the quality of a gem is with a orb called a GCP (Gemcutter Prism). These are a very expensive trade asset so the last thing you want to do is waste these frivolously. My advise is when you are ready to get your 20% quality gems is to go on trade chat and try to find a 15%+ skill gem. From here it is a lot cheaper to get it to 20% with your GCP's then doing it from 0% all the way up. Even if the person charges an arm and a leg for the gem (which they will) it still usually ends up being cheaper to do it this way instead. 

-----------------------------

**VENDOR RECIPE TIPS / TRADE TIPS**

* Vendor recipes: http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Vendor_Recipes

* Primary things you need to save are 3 link red/blue/green items (vendors for chromatic orbs)

* 6 socket anything (if it has crappy links 3 or less) I vendor these for 7 jeweler orbs (some say try to trade all 6 socket items, that is up to you just don't get less than 7 jeweler orbs in trade)

* 5L and 6L items... these sell in trade for major bank... the 6L vendors for 1 divine.. so take no less than that in trade.. honestly its worth quite a bit more.

* Also, don't be so quick to Id all your rares.... try to save them if they have crappy sockets or look low level. If you use 1 of each type of rare (2 handed weap, armor, helm, boots, gloves, amulet, belt, 2x rings) all unid you can vendor that for 2x chaos orbs... if they are all id then its 1xchaos. Also, it can be 2x 1 handers or 1 hand + shield instead of using 2 handed weap in this recipe.

* Lastly, keep your eyes peeled for non quest given gems and gems with quality % in them. Both of these kind of gems are rare and trade for high rates to players. Here are a list of quest reward gems so you know which you can from quests and which are rare.

**Item Level**

You can tell true item level by picking up an item in your cursor.. and typing /itemlevel

The following info is updated off forums.. may or map not be accurate, but it's a good guess for now.

Item level needed for number of sockets:

1: 1

2: 1

3: 15

4: 28

5: 35

6: 50 (lowest seen so far)

*Update: On socket levels from Icy_Inferno*

**TRADE TIPS**

There is going to come a point eventually when you are going to need to barter with people to get the uniques and 5-6L gear you need. Here are some bookmarks to help you navigate trades better.

Exalted, GCP (gemcutter prism), Chaos and Alchemy are the 4 big trade orbs in the game... people love to trade in terms of those a lot. I am not saying other orbs don't have value, but trades are way harder with those currency types then the 4 listed above. I try to consolidate into those forms as much as I can for easy trade.

&gt; Here are a set of links you should bookmark

&gt; * Currency Exchange rates:  http://www.poeex.info/

&gt; This is mandatory link so you know what orbs are worth what!

&gt;* The full list of unique items: http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Unique_Items

&gt;Specifically pay attention to the ranges each items stats can roll at. A perfect roll may trade for more than random scattered stat one.

1359663859.0,146,self.pathofexile,17ndjg,A look at mana mechanics,troglodyte,173,27,55,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17ndjg/a_look_at_mana_mechanics/,"I've been investigating mana for my own education, and there's a few non-obvious lessons from my reading and testing that I wanted to share. Please weigh in if you have additional experience or corrections; hopefully this helps people plan their DPS sustainability strategy.

**Mana regeneration is based on your maximum mana.**

This is a *crucial* bit of information. One of the mistakes I made early, and I see a lot of players make, is to undervalue increased maximum mana. After all, the thinking goes, my goal is not to *lengthen* the period in which I can spam my skill, but to render it effectively infinite such that mana is no longer a limiting factor on my skills! This logic has several problems, but one of the biggest is the avoidance of *derived stats*. Because mana regeneration is derived from maximum mana, increasing your maximum mana pool can *dramatically* increase your mana regeneration!

A brief example:

&gt; A character has no mana regeneration items and 100 mana. His regeneration rate is 105 mana per minute, or 1.75 mana per second. Adding 12% maximum mana results in a pool of 112 mana and a regen rate of 117.6 mana per minute or 1.96 mana per second. A once-per-second, 10 mana attack skill can be used 11 times before empty without any passives. With the +12% max mana, it can be used 14 times.

What else can we learn from derived stats?

The more mana regeneration you have, the more valuable maximum mana is in terms of increasing effective regeneration. Consider the case of a player with 100% increased mana regen and 100 mana. This means that his mana regen is 3.5 per second. Adding another 50% mana regen grants 4.375 mana regeneration. However, if that same player were to add 25 mana, they'd see the *exact same absolute regeneration rate!* Why is this interesting? Because 50% mana regen is a level 50 mod and 25 max mana is a level 17 mod! Because *each point of max mana is more effective per percent of increased regeneration, the value of max mana increases the higher your regen is, often beyond a much more ""valued"" regen affix!*

The converse is also true; if your maximum mana is very high, each point of mana regeneration is more effective.

There's a few more points to be made: each level grants you 4 mana, and each point of Int gives you .5 mana. This makes percent increased max mana nodes quite good, since they further increase the value of all flat max mana upgrades.

So with all the math aside, what are the lessons here?

* Maximum mana is an effective way to increase *absolute* mana regeneration per second (doesn't affect relative MPS).
* As your increased regeneration percentage increases, the value of 1 point of maximum mana increases; the converse is also true. Keep in mind that max mana's regeneration property is a secondary effect and that you *also* get increased max mana!
* Because mana increases naturally, the percent increase to max mana passive nodes will often be one of the most effective ways to generate long-term sustainability.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1359664352.0,,,True,t3_17ndjg,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17ndjg/a_look_at_mana_mechanics/,

Possibility of prismatic socket on items. Items would be **limited** **to 1** prismatic socket per item. Prismatic sockets would be somewhat rarer to roll with Chromatic orbs. Vendoring ""trash"" items with B-G-P or R-G-P or R-B-P would yield a chromatic orb.





Thoughts? Critiques? Suggestions? I don't think it would be that hard to implement it since there's already Tabula Rasa with prismatic sockets. 



Edit: Also, what about making a prismatic socket an item mod? Any thoughts on that? Suffix: **of Rainbow**, prefix: **Flamboyant**, makes item sockets prismatic.

And no its not the dsynce its the UI. 



1)When you are in a group and you have gen-chat open or the trade chat the left side of your screen basically becomes a death trap. You have no idea what monsters are there. You have to look past all the UI components. 

2) Why are the icons and life bars so large for group members? I would understand if this was WOW or something like that where there is a class that can heal people and maintain people but PoE does not have that. Team life bars should not be that big, because frankly if it goes down you cant do anything about it. cant send them a potion cant cast a heal.

3) Final problem that I have with the UI is how instances and group members work. I don't understand why the member icon disapears if you are in a different instance. And to find out where your team is you have to hit ""S"" and than go to current group because by default its always friends list. That seems like alot of work to find out where your team is or even to see if you are even still in a group. (everyone may have left or been kicked and u did not see the text on the right side) 

So yeah, those are my main 3 problems with the UI BUT im not just going to complain. Here is what I think should be done. 1) Smaller Icons 2) MUCH SMALLER life bars 3) Grey Out absent party members 4) Move some of the UI to the right

I started playing this genre since times of lore. As a casual player i was watching the genre growing and evolving year by year.
Finally when it got shaped by first Diablo game, i learned that there is a thing called ''Computer game addiction''

Im a big fan of action RPG games for almost 2 decades now.
However, the last good games in this genre were Diablo 2 and Neverwinter nights first edition.
Since then, everything went downhill..Until PoE came.

Ill be very short.
In these 2 decades i have never seen a game with such a strong concept and system. Looks like PoE completed the puzzle, the puzzle that was in the making for 30 years.

**You guys did what Diablo did 17 years ago. You shaped the genre.**

I predict PoE to be the most played game of the genre till 2014.

I'm an avid gamer, and really love your game, but I am forced to mouse with my left hand all of my key binds have to be on the numpad, or home insert delete pgup etc, occasionally spilling over to backspace. Because of this I often have to combine ctrl-num1-7 (can't reach 8 and ctrl)

There are currently no ctrl key combinations allowed but you also cannot bind many of the other keys I need to use at all. I tried mentioning this to Nerf in the HC general chat but I believe it got drowned out in the noise. 

It would be really awesome if some tweaking could be done to address this issue, thanks for reading.

Fucked up hands, need to be able to bind keys that are currently unbindable; Necessary for me and I'm sure convenient for many others.

1367966621.0,131,self.pathofexile,1dw5pu,Suggestion For Passive Tree To Discourage HP Node Hopping And Encourage Build Specializing,Mande1baum,157,26,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1dw5pu/suggestion_for_passive_tree_to_discourage_hp_node/,"TL/DR: Relocate passive %HP nodes into a single more powerful passive next to other notables in passive tree to encourage specialization and build diversity rather than %HP stacking.

It seems many 'builds' are the same path(s) through passive tree in order to maximize %HP nodes (and a few other select defensive passives) and then pick up any offensive nodes that actually define our build if they are already on the path. I hardly see stacking HP nodes as specializing into a specific build (since everyone, save for CI, wants lots of it) and makes my build feel more generic rather than unique and personalized.

My suggestion would be remove many (all) of the plain 8% life nodes from the tree... and instead make them stronger (16-20%?) and nestle a single passive into the end of other nodes, perhaps after the notable. By doing this, rather than building towards HP nodes, you go towards the nodes that better fit/define your build and the %HP is a reward for committing to/completing a node. [This is an amazing MS Paint rendering for visual reference of a few variations.](http://imgur.com/t7ysL32).

This would also encourage specializing a build even further! Now there would be more of a reason to commit to a weapon type for melee (ax v sword v etc) or elemental type of damage (for casters) in order to reach that juicy HP bonus at end. It also frees up more passive points to invest in other means of survival (evasion &amp; armor, block instead of dual wield/2h, elemental status/stun resistance, etc).

With the extra passives available, investing in accuracy (and getting the %HP at end) becomes a viable option rather than relying on RT (which will also opens up crit for melee!) or Lioneye's Glare. The same can be said for mana regen. Rather than depending on Blood Magic or Eldritch Battery, builds can find a way to sustain themselves without these single passive point investment crutches. Currently every point you invest in mana or %regen is lost HP if you don't use BM or EB.

One last bonus would be this may open up new paths for navigating passive tree. Currently there are many alternate paths through passive tree that unfortunately require 3-6+ passive to complete the node(s) and are therefore neglected in favor of +10 attribute main paths that can accomplish the same path for less points (so more can be invested in HP...). Variety and options are good imo.

Two possible downsides are apparent to me. First is people investing in passives that have no value to their build just for the HP at end (accuracy for a FP guy for example). However, if people have to invest at least 4 points (3 into node and 1 for %HP) and the HP node grans 20% HP (for example), that's 5% per node, which is currently much less than the 8% or more currently available. Therefore, a HP only build is much less viable, but keeping some of the pure HP nodes in tree (such as those in middle of tree) could still be available for such builds as RF.

The other downside is it makes low life (Shavronne's)/CI a much less appealing choice. These builds would be right next to multiple single passives that would grant a substantial amount of HP for little investment that they miss out on. Perhaps CI could convert a fraction of %HP into %ES as well... like 20% HP = 8% ES. So any easy solution for CI but not Shavronne's, but that's a rather niche build with it's own bonuses...

So I think this idea could really encourage more and better build diversity in the game. Melee builds will have an incentive to invest in more offensive nodes (like accuracy/crit) rather than simply defensive. Also, builds could add more layers than currently available due to limited free passives after HP. Maybe that 2H Infernal blow (already investing in 2h and fire passives) build could add some stun nodes! Or switch it to Infernal Blow and block (1H, block, and fire nodes). Or my Dominating Blow 2H can add some actual dps or mana regen since so many points are currently invested in increased duration and minions. I guess I'm just saying that currently with the passives left after HP, you can only specialize in 2 things. By making specializing in a 3rd thing an option without spreading yourself too thin, build diversity could potentially explode!

Implementation could be a lil tricky as this would revamp whole tree (not just Duelist as in past). Perhaps GGG could just refund HP passives, add new HP passives to tree, and players could reinvest those refunded points accordingly. This would leave people who had traveled branches in tree to only HP nodes hanging and require they use their own Orbs or Regret to refund those now naked and useless branches. Yay massive currency dumps!

So thoughts/critiques?

TL/DR: Relocate passive %HP nodes into a single more powerful passive next to other notables/nodes in passive tree to encourage specialization and build diversity rather than %HP stacking.

Bonuses: 1. More room for specialization (or min/maxing). 2. Less dependence on crutches such as BM, EB. 3.

Basically boils down to severe performance degradation in party play/act 3 due to non-optimized spell and other lighting effects. Note that crossfire setups, which are a lot more powerful, are obviously less affected.

The reply:

&gt; We've received many reports of
problems with ATI cards, and there are a few responses scattered
through various threads that have been made. We have the cards on our
list to check and optimize for, but our lead programmer is still
dealing with the numerous problems caused by Open Beta so we likely
won't be able to investigate for at least a month, sorry! Any
information you can come up with for how well different driver
versions perform would be helpful, though we will of course do these
tests when we have copies of the cards in the office.

Edit: please vote this up for more visibility if you also experience similar problems. If you are not experiencing poor performance, please don't downvote.

Edit 2: if you have an ATI/AMD card (no crossfire) and have good performance (even in party play on highest settings), please post your system specs, including drivers!

Edit 3: doesn't seem to matter whether you use an Intel CPU or an AMD CPU. Both are affected.

Edit 4: it seems more and more that systems with slower/older CPU's (AMD, Clarkdale Intel Core i3/i5, Sandy/Ivy Bridge Intel Core i3) in combination with ATI/AMD GPU's are affected the most.

I've noticed this happens most of the time exactly when an enemy dies, takes a hit **or a charge is put into the potion**.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZVQmxMqlTw)  
  
This is a pretty major bug to me since potion usage is very key gameplay component of POE. I have done further testing and it is surely a bug related to potions gaining charges as enemies die/or from crit refills, **the game doesn't know what to do when it has to fill a potion and empty it at the same time so it simply plays the sound effect and does nothing.**",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1359981938.0,,,True,t3_17u65x,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17u65x/bug_video_potions_will_not_activate_regardless_of/,

Yes, that means you can take your 600life melee witch to maps if you want.

**-MASSIVE economy.** 

Whats that? you were having trouble finding that niche item in hardcore? Well come on down to default we have it.

**-Bigger playerbase.**

More people to run maps with. More players to trade with. More players participating in intellectual discussion on general chat.
(Last night we had a discussion about string theory in general chat with inputs from over 80 different people. Professors from all over the world joined in and gave their opinions and contributed to the discussion.)

**-Developers favour default players more.**

Why? Because they dont QQ on the forums when their character gets nerfed, or they die to ""desync""

Oh and one more... 

**-You will never hear complains about desync or lag.**
Why? Because default players never die to desync. Its just a myth that hardcore players make up, to blame other people for their own mistakes.

Default is just generally a happier and more friendly place.
Come on down, we have blackjack and hookers aswell!

Default players also are charitable, in that they also literally throw away their currency. We have so much in default that players don't even bother picking up gcp's when running maps any more.

Hello Community!

A group of my buddies and I have been working on a site which will convert a inputted value of currencies and outputs it as single currency value. A reason why we thought this would be a good idea is because during trades either on forums, or even in game we have noticed a issue where people get offered a huge amount of currencies and can't tell if that offer is higher than the previous. With this tool, you will be able to input the value of the offer, and you can see how much it is worth in, Exalted Orbs values, GCP value or even in a Chaos Orb value.

We will be monitoring the marketplace values on currencies daily and try out best in updating the value of each currency to make it as accurate as possible.

This was made for the community so we hope that the community will also contribute and help us maintain the correct values on the currencies on the Hardcore League and Default League.

If you have any questions please feel free to send me a PM, or email us at admin@poecalc.com!

Buddha

Remember this is just my idea, my suggestion, feel free to share you opinion and pros/cons, please.

Today I took a look at the ""subreddits"" of PoE (Look at the sidebar), and realised they're all dead (except PoETradeing). My suggestions is that we keep people together in two subreddits.
The first one would be the ""main or original subreddit"", (This one). Where people would share Vods of people dying, build Q/A's, suggestions to the game, and stuff in that catogory.

The second one would be for trading, as trading post would get flooded if it was in the ""main subrredit"".

The reason I think this is ""necessary"" or there's a good reason for this, is because we're not a super huge subreddit and spreading people into catogorys with only 10 players online at a time just dosen't feel right to me, atleast.

English ain't my native language, so there might be some typos. I tried to express myself as clearly as I could.

there wouldnt be a search option in game, but people could still post their shop lists on the forum. that way people could still use poe.xyz to search items. 

there would be no bidding on items via shops, items are posted with a buyout only. if people spot an item they want and want it cheaper than ppsted theyll have to wait until you log in. 

the only thing this changes with the current setup is that you dont have to wait for people to log on in order to buy an item.

edit: this is probably the best suggestion ive seen so far.....written by MrLoque

 Technically speaking... I don't think this is doable: it would require some kind of ""persistent"" world where GGG lets players create shops. It's like housing, where you have a constant presence in the world. It would add a lot of pressure on the servers and -on top of that- I guess the game engine/coding is not compatible with such a solution. On a side note, adding buyout and/or any currency ""instant purchase"" would defeat the bartering mechanic (which is the core of PoE's economy). As written here  (not my idea, it was from cXs808) I'd suggest something like this:_________________________________________ The ""shopping stash tab"" could be the best idea, in my opinion. It was suggested by someone on this subReddit and it works this way: you put one or more items inside the ""sell"" stash tab those items are visible until you logout people go to a new ""bazaar"" vendor in town people search something, for example ""sword, level 50-55, 4 sockets"" the bazaar internal search engine lists all the available swords from online (active) stash tabs, from all the active plaers, right now when something nice is found, the player hits the ""contact seller"" button and starts the barter stuff It would be a sortable/searchable list of AVAILABLE items from ONLINE players. It would not offer a bid/buyout button though, but it would tremendously help finding items and avoiding spam._________________________________________",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1363950914.0,,,True,t3_1aqlxv,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1aqlxv/what_would_be_peoples_thoughts_on_a_trading/,

I have been trying to figure out what rares are best to keep in my stash (since my stash is becoming too cluttered!).

The background to this is that most rares that you will obtain below level 50 will be from drops (since it may not be worth using currency items like orbs of alchemy on lower level items). 

After level 50, links on rares become vital for survivability/dps so crafting rares from this point should be considered.


From the Mechanics thread on the PoE website:

Item level needed for number of sockets (research ongoing)

1 socket : 1

2 sockets: 1

3 sockets: 15

4 sockets: 28

5 sockets: 35

6 sockets: 50 (lowest seen so far)


I have come up with the following:

* Since support gems only start from level 12, all rares with good/average stats below level 12 should be kept to power up twinks since links are not that important. Two socket rares will always be better but it's not vital since you won't be running many skills at that point.

* From level 12 to 35, links on rares become important to use support gems. Only keep rares will good linked sockets or very OP rares without linked sockets. It is not worth using fusings on low level items. It is probably better using a well-rolled magic item with good linked sockets than a rare without linked sockets. Also at these levels 3 linked 1h weapons and shields are very important, but you could make do with 2 links.

* From level 35 to 50, if you are rich you can maybe start to look out for 5-link white items and start crafting. For your average person, following the bullet above will still probably be the route to follow. Links on rares at these levels of the game are even more important since you need high dps skills to kill mobs efficiently.

* From level 50 onwards, you can begin to craft items as getting rares with good stats and good linked sockets are very uncommon. Find white items with 4 or 5 linked sockets (4 links for gloves/boots/helms and 5 links for chest armour/2h weapons/bows). If you find a good rare as a drop, you could also use fusings/jewelers to try to get good links and sockets. 


So to summarise, keep all rares below level 12 regardless of sockets/links. 

After this point, links become vital so rares that drop with bad sockets (below level 50) should be vendored unless they have really good stats (can then decide to use currency on them to improve them).

Some other tips:

* From normal Act 2 (late Act 1) start looking for 3-linked RGB for chromatic orbs at vendors

* From cruel Act 1 start looking for 5-linked items for crafting at vendors

* From cruel Act 3 start looking for 6 socket items (links are optional) for crafting or to vendor back for 7 jeweler orbs

* In merciless difficulty if you are still using low level items, find 3/4/5/6 linked items from vendors to craft since they will be high item level.

* Always check vendors every time you level up! If you are in merciless, take the wp back to other acts/difficulties.

* You could keep rares that are bad in your stash to sell to a vendor using the chaos orb recipe, although finding rare rings/belts/amulets are very difficult.

* If you craft a crappy item (with 20% quality) , keep it and get a normal and magic item of the same type with 20% quality to get an orb of alchemy from the vendor

On my screen(1280x800px) This box takes up about 230px of the screen while the actual skill tree is only about 450px.  Zooming out in the browser gives a much better ratio but makes the text from the nodes difficult to read.  Is there any particular reason anybody knows of as to why it is set up this way?  It isn't that big of a deal, but it makes planning out builds on the website needlessly difficult.

Something like http://i.imgur.com/6OcxEwM.png or even http://i.imgur.com/2JR4Led.png seems so much more sensible(in the current implementation almost half the right side is empty space)

Or even better, have it pop up when you hover near the bottom of the screen(if even only in fullscreen)

**tl;dr:** why so much wasted space on the website version of the passive tree calc?

If in chrome: open your javascript console(Ctrl+Shift+J) and hit the Console button, should be on the right, then paste in

that will remove the panel entirely, refresh the page to make it come back

edit: Person who made Tools of Exile says it DOESN'T hook into the game, so it may not be bannable for sure and Chris might have just given a generic response about 3rd party tools in general. Still, use at your own risk, but it may not be malicious and may be harmless. Keep in mind anything that just reads memory and uses overlays is nearly undetectable unless they are specifically targetting things like that.

Please let me know if you have anything to add, would be much appreciated (:

Path of Exile is an action rpg, meaning you control a character from a topdown perspective while smashing monsters and getting loot. You will create a character who is one of six classes: Marauder (strength), Witch (intelligence), Ranger (dexterity), Templar (strength/intelligence), Duelist (strength/dexterity), Shadow (dexterity/intelligence). As you plow through your enemies you will discover the secrets of Wraeclast, and once you finish, you get to do it again, only harder (: There will be 3 acts, and 3 difficulties (normal, cruel, merciless) in the open beta.

Skills in this game are determined by things called skill gems. You place them in your equipment to use them, and they will level up as you do. There are a ton of skills, viewable [here](http://www.pathofexile.com/skills). Skills can be modified by passive gems, but must be linked to the gem. In your equipment there are colored slots where you can place a gem, and a gold bar between them means they are linked.

Every level you gain in path of exile gives you a passive skill point, as well as a few quests. The passive skill tree (more like a forest), viewable [here](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree) will determine how your character plays. It is **highly, highly** recommended you plan out your character atleast a little before getting started. It is also strongly recommended that you focus on defensive stats first, and let your skill gems handle the majority of your damage. You can go pure offensive and make it a little ways, but I guarantee you will hit a large wall of death rather quickly. I will link some easy to use builds that cover each of the playstyles below if you are a little lost on what to do. 

Flasks are nifty little potions that persist after their use, only consuming a little bit of charge. Charge is earned back by killing enemies. There are a few types of flasks - Health, Mana, Hybrid, Diamond (100% crit chance), Quicksilver (40% movement speed), Granite (4,000 armor :O), and 1 for each of the elemental resistences. They can all have modifiers, such as a health potion that heals for only 50% of its amount, but does so instantly. Or a mana potion that gains more charge each time you get a critical hit. Getting appropriate flasks for you build is extremely important. 

Yet another unique/cool thing in PoE is the currency. It isn't money - it is either good items useful for bartering and selling, and the orbs. All the orbs have some effect on items - such as the Orb of Alchemy which will turn a white item into a yellow (rare) item. You can view them [here](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data/currency) and you can get an idea for the (complicated) exchange rates [here](http://www.poeex.info/). Finding items is a huge part of this game, but sometimes the RNG gods are not with you, so crafting / upgrading an item to your suiting is sometimes required. It is suggested you save most good orbs (alchemy, chaos, regal, etc) for higher levels when the items you are crafting will last you for a long time. One super important gem is the Gem Cutter's Prism. It's called GCP and it's the SOJ of this game basically (a staple of the exchange rates/trading kind of).

Crafting in this game revolves around using the currency to modify items. Starting out, you'll just want to use transmuation orbs on white items and maybe use alterations if they're awful. Typically just do this on some sapphire rings to help you get past hailrake and merveil, as well as maybe a good weapon you find. Later on, you will want to modify your flasks. Once you're comfortable with your build and decently far, it's a good time to maybe invest some currency into items. If you find a strong white item with the sockets and links you want (like a 4 red linked weapon if you're a 2h marauder) it's worth it to get it's quality up to 20 and try an orb of alchemy and chaos on it if you can't find good drops. Often you should be able to trade for good items, but finding the right combination of sockets and links is really hard. My marauder needs 3 red and a green for one of it's abilities, which isn't something commonly traded. However, this is where chromatic orbs can also help. If someone has a strong 4 linked item, but they're all the wrong colors, you can take your chances with chromatic orbs which will re-randomize the socket colors. But don't expect to get it easily. 

A brief run down on the orbs (reading them is also a good idea ;p )
Armourer scrap and blacksmiths whetstones improve quality (improves base stat). Transmuation = white -&gt; blue. Alchemy = white -&gt; yellow. Alteration = reforge a blue. Chaos = reforge a yellow. Augmentation = add a new property to a blue. Exalted = add a new property to a yellow. Jeweler = randomize sockets. Chromatic = randomize colors. 

Some useful buttons and knowledge :

* P - Brings up the passive skill tree 
* U - Brings up the quest menu thing/map
* Tab - Brings your minimap up full screen (can still play with it up)
* Arrow keys - Will move the TAB map around
* Alt - will show all items on ground
* Z  - Makes it so you don't have to press alt (: Suggest you make it so you have to hold a button to pick up items though, so you aren't picking up every white on the ground
* C - brings up character panel, where you can view tons of stats about everything
* Ctrl + Alt + left click - Will put an item in the chat box if it is open (press return)
* View items in chat by opening chat box and mousing over them
* Ctrl + left click waypoint or entrance - Will let you reset the zone so you can do it again.
* Zones autoreset after 8-15 minutes, including your portal to them so don't afk in town if you're working your way through a zone. 
* F1 will bring up ping and framerate meters
* Always build more defense / resistences with gear and passive skill tree, damage will come easily to well thought out skills+supports
* ""Never"" will almost always preclude ""always"". I.E. Resolute strike is never have critical hits, this will cancel out even diamond flasks (all critical hits) .
* Chaos inoculation will bring your max hp to 1/1, allowing you to use items or skills that say ""when on full hp"". However, your hp is 1/1 so anything that uses hp (blood magic, flasks) will kill you. This also means you will be frozen for longer since its based on your max hp, and you will avoid hp passives since you're focusing only on energy shield.
* Building pure evasion is a good way to get 1 shot.
* Get resistance rings for Merveil and she is a lot easier.
* In act 2, talk to everyone in town to get their quests, do all of them and it will open the vines (no spoilers). Probably most asked question in the game. 
* If a place on the main map ('u', or use waypoint) has a filled in dot, or a small blue dot inside the circle, it means there is a waypoint there. 
* Avoid making builds around a certain weapon type (swords, axes, etc) unless you're willing to deal with bad luck possibly screwing you out of any good weapons of that type for a long time. 
* Some common acronyms as follows -
CI - Chaos Inoculation, LS - Lightning Strike, LA - Lightning arrow, GCP - Gem cutters prism, ES - Energy Shield, EV - Evasion, 
* Check out lockdown6435's post [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/16ixh3/a_quick_getting_started_guide/c7wv3a7). Covers almost every acronym (: 
* There are things called charges, they come in 3 flavors - Endurance, Power, Frenzy. Endurance charges increase damage reduction and resistances by 5% per charge. Power increase critical stike chance by 50% each charge. Frenzy increase attack and cast speed by 5% per charge. They are built up through various skills and unique items. You can only have 3 when you start, but some passives can allow you to have 6 or so. That's extremely strong, and a good idea to include in builds if you can.
* Chat commands that you may find useful. /deaths - displays number of deaths. /played - hours played. /age - how long your character has been alive. /ladder shows top 10 people in the game currently on your league. 
* To talk in different channels use symbols before your message. @name message will whisper name with message. #message will display your message to global. $message will send it to trade chat (by default it is disabled, click the check mark above your chat box to reenable it). %message will talk to your party. 

Mechanics

In this game there are a **ton** of very specific mechanics that you should definitely be aware of. There's far too many to put here, so I'll post a [link](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/11707) to someone on the game's forums who did an excellent job. He goes greatly into depth with a lot of it, which isn't too necessary to know when first starting. I'll put some key points here though if you don't feel like reading that.


* **Most bonuses are multiplicative, not additive.**
* Flat damage bonus (like +7-25 lightning damage on a ring) is not added to spells or traps.
* Flask recovery does not stack, it is queued - strongest first.
* utility flasks such as granite and resistance flasks are stacked
* Everyone's base mana regen is 1.75% of mana pool / second or 105% of mana pool / minute.
* There is a drop rate penalty for every 2 levels you are over the zone
* For good experience you should stay within 3 or 4 levels of a zone.
* Dual wielding gives you a base 10% attack speed and 15% to block. Most skills only use the main hand.
* Read the forum post if you'd like the rest, it's very informative (:


Builds

Duelist - Cool 1h rapier/shield lightning strike. Most of the gems you get from quests at the start make it easy to maintain. Very survivable, while still having good damage output. [Link](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgQAmSunn5-jAdwb-iXfhNlHfqvFWNtT35uDhO907XrvYEsFLUCg704otWCIYVKfyzIJVgSGYDpS37826AHnpzD3vhQgUEevohDwF9wGojpxG6qI7W1KgTohYMEH1340NXTx1FIG7pdwYxeeuRjbW6_dDTqzNYadqrnN_MVnoId2Sn1W-nRBFHUOrSmlpMJdAN1G_E5jp7cXOJYUUmVN7g5OyDWSI_bv8FpI) Lightning strike may get nerfed in open beta, beware (along with lightning arrow)

Marauder - Super plain and simple. High hp and resists 2h marauder build. Sweep and Heavy Strike work well with it, but you can change it up to suit whatever you're going for from there. [link](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgEAxthYY1BQjM_2SF8_Pfx8uCkujAakrO8Oud3yL3uMIQIq9iFVOQ7cPagYah5qOyDwROcc59lhVw2RzhkuNrrynAsoqRpEsnbu9zJyqXzZJ-3z3VRJ51LBBFW1ns2nMBQgUEc=)


Ranger - This one's just a link to the forum post, he does a good job of demonstrating how the build works and pros/cons. [link](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/62131) Built to work in open beta


Witch - This one's a little harder to obtain due to gems but it's really strong. Dual totems casting icespear, using curses. Clears maps without any hard work from you (: [link](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/61726)

Recipes

When you're selling items to the merchant, there are a few recipes to keep in mind that will really help you accumulate some currency faster than finding them alone. [This](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Vendor_Recipes) link here covers them, but ill list a few that you should keep in mind when hunting. 

* 3 linked slots of the colors (red, blue, green) will sell for a chromatic orb.
* surgeon flasks give you an alchemy shard
* Armor and weapons with combined qualities of 40% sell for armourers scrap and blacksmiths whetstone, respectively
* A rare from each slot ( weapon, jewelry, armor ) all at once will get you a chaos orb
* A gem + an orb of scouring will de-level the gem once. This is useful if you lose some stats from gear and can no longer use the higher level one.

There are a whole lot more, but those are the ones that are pretty easy to get

If you wish to learn more, please visit the website at [pathofexile.com](http://pathofexile.com). They did a great job putting all the information there, and the forums have a lot of the answers to the harder questions like What happens when I put on chaos inoculation and eldritch battery? (answer: you die ;p ). Also people are very helpful in the global chat, so don't be afraid to ask questions. There's a lot of spam there (to be expected), so please try to research your question yourself first and don't spam global with it. You will remember things you learn a lot better than things you are told.

If you would like to see some of the excellent ideas that can come to life in this game then I highly highly recommend the build of the week videos. They showcase some really interesting ideas that the incredibly flexibility and customization in this game lends itself to. [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CHGLWhMunM) This one shows a Shadow using Flicker Strike and  Chaos Inoculation (it's changing in open beta so this build will have to change a lot) but it's really strong. [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_EcQDOUN9Y) one shows a more creative build with a guy 1 shotting everything with his fists. It's pretty funny

* 2) Use Pages for Stash Tabs instead of the scrolling arrows; it's slightly frustrating to have to click over, and it seems like it would make more sense to have a page of 6 tabs, then another page of 6 tabs.
* 3) Allow us to change the font size of a Stash Tab name. For example, if I want to call a tab ""Rings and Flasks"", I don't want it to now take up a huge amount of space in this tab name list. Or, maybe there could be an option to constrain tabs to a certain size which would automatically reduce the font of the name. 
* 4) Make it more obvious when a quality gem drops. Just as items work, perhaps gems could be called ""Superior Greater Multiple Projectiles.""
* 5) When you combine a stack of items and it produces a greater quailty item, put the quality item under our cursor instead of the remaining stack. For example if I make an Orb of Transmutation from shards, I have to set down the Shards, pick up the Orb, and add it to my stack. Switch it so that what I make is under my cursor and I can go ahead and add it to my already existing stack.

I understand that the devs want to keep this competitive looting system in the game, but is there really a reason for it not to be optional when creating a party?

Sure theres people who favor this system, but the truth is that a lot of us don't, i for example simply don't party up with random people and don't do public maps as a result of the system.

This is a true shame as in online games, i think playing together and the social aspects of it increase It's replay value an incredible amount, community is usually key to me.

It's nice that GGG follows their own vision, and you've created an absolutely amazing game doing so, but the loot system just seems archaic at best, i want to be able to play with my friends and not worry about who gets which pieces of loot, i want to play with them because It's an enjoyable experience, not because it increases the amount of loot we get.

I hope that GGG sees their fault in this despite those people who support the FFA system and sooner or later we will have a party option to OPT out of it.

You can't have actual conversations except answer some questions or sending some people to trade chat. The game feels much more like a single player game since the instanced chat rooms.

The chance of getting a nice upgrade and maybe a valuable orb.

I know it was removed to prevent abuse from farmers. Perhaps it could be introduced but only if you have the required quest state e.g ""Kill Merveil"".

It's like in D3 when in normal you would always get a rare if you killed the boss the first time.

While on the topic of loot; I like playing self found. At least until i get to the end game. But sometimes there are a couple of uniques that are required for the build. It would be cool if it was like in D2 where certain bosses or mobs had a much higher chance of dropping a type of unique. That way you could actually farm a specific boss or area in hopes of finding this build enabling unique. Like finding Sidhebreath from the Necro boss in Fetid Pools. You could give clues to the player of where to find them by having the mob or boss drop a note with clues of what item it has a higher chance to drop. Eventually we would have knowledge of where to farm for what item. Maybe it's already in the game just that we don't know where to farm what.

Il try to explain this as basic as possible, to make it understandable for most readers.


I will start with introducing myself. I recently graduated at my university, studying business economics.  I started playing PoE at the start of open beta, but quit around a month after the Shavronne patch. With the start of Anarchy, I decided to start playing again. Ive played many RPG's in the past and I never had any trouble understanding its economy and how to make easy and quick money.


I currently have a level 70 templar with 13 pure exalted and 8 exalted equivalent (the equivalent includes a 5L6s Carcass Jack (2,5 exalted) and a 5L6s Searing Touch (2 exalted)). Minus the Midnight Bargain and the high currency that I found (1GCP total), this means I made over 18 exalted buying and selling items using the forum and the in game trade channel. I accomplished this by making smart use of the economy, and in some cases ""flipping items"". My /played time says I have been playing for little over 24 hours. This is including time standing afk in town. Im sure some of you think ""well, 21 exalted is nothing"". While this may be true, keep in mind that I got this amount by creating currency out of nothing. Getting currency from drops in maps is a lot easier, and so is finding a mirror or a Shavronne. 


**Remember, all examples are about Anarchy league. Even though this is the case, you can easily use what I said in other leagues as well.**


So, PoE economics. No auction house. This makes two things harder: getting items and making money. In case you are wondering, if you know how things work, auction houses are like people constantly handing you free money even if you are offline. Depending on how this post is received, I could go in dept about this one too. PoE doesnt have an auction house, and uses the forum and trading channel instead. The important thing is that you know how to utilize both, which I will describe later. No auction house also means that no prices are set in stone, which causes both freedom and confusion.


Let's start with the basics:


- Rares suck

- Uniques are overrated

- Ratio's 


**Rares suck**

A harsh statement, but most of the time true. Unless it's a chest or a godly item, rares oftentimes do not receive the value they should be rated at. Since most rares are not really comparable, you are at the mercy of the buyers/sellers valuation and emotional attachment to the item. Buying and selling these items are in most cases high risk while not extra rewarding.


**Uniques are overrated**

Its the opposite of what is happening with rares. Not only are uniques easy to compare, you even know how close to perfect the percentages are. Not only does this make the price evaluation easy, it also enables ""lazy"" buyers to find the item that they want much quicker. This causes a higher demand for a item that might be much cheaper in comparable stats as a rare version. Lastly, instead of a emotional attachement, uniques add a historic perception to the item (in my language we have a term for it, which I was unable to find as a translation to english using google. Maybe someone in the comments can give a wikipedia link). Let me give an example of this perception.


Example: In the next patch, all health nodes get brought down to 4% each, because life builds are still used in the large majority of the builds. By doing this, Kaom's Heart would turn out to be a niche item with a significantly lower value compared to its current value. However, instead of a 2 exalted value, its price will probably only get dropped for half right away, and will stop at 6 instead. This is because people remember its high price and will not accept its new real value. This can also work the other way around (something becomes more expensive). However, people will much more easily up their price, making a smaller window to capitalize on.


**Ratio's**

We all know them; 


2 alch/scouring/fusing = 1 chaos/regret, 4 chaos/regret=1gcp, 10-14gcp=1 exalted.


Even though I use these ratings myself as well, they are wrong. This is where the only positive factor of botters/RMT comes into play. Their ratio's are actually spot on. Why? Because they have the largest movement on currency, while also tracking everything in bookkeeping. They know exactly what is in abundance and what is scarce. Granted, they play a major factor in the constant rise of exalted orbs. However, inflation is good. It's a sign of a healthy economy. Botters make the process go faster, but inflation will always be there. Ask your grandpa how much a loaf of bread used to cost when he was a kid.


While most of the ""basic"" ratio's still apply and different botters offer different ratio's, its telling us a few things;


Fusings are best, alchs are okay, scourings are garbage. Chaos is pretty stable, regret is pretty meh. No one wants blessed and divines.

 
Above statings are a little overreacted, but they are true. What does this mean? In most cases, nothing really.  It just means that should always be willing to trade alch and scourings for fusings, regrets for chaos and keep the amount of divine and blessed at zero. People will stick to the basic ratio's, and so will you. Just dont lose sight of the botter's ratio's, so your assortment of currency is always what the masses need.


The final thing about ratio's is that it should always be rated from 1 exalted. This is because it's the only stable/rising currency in the game. Even Eternal orbs went from three to two exalted, and I would not be surprised if it went further down (with a rise at the end of the 4-month leagues).


Now, onto the real stuff:


**Pricing items**

I will limit this to uniques only. Even though I have bought multiple rares during my playtime, I dont think I have sold a single rare on my Templar. It just takes too much time while not giving much of value (even though certain items are pretty good). The fastest and easiest way to know the price of a certain item is poe.xyz.is. Type in the name, pick the right league and then open most if not all pages. Look for b/o prices, items that are no longer verified, date and highest c/o. Looking at multiple threads should give you a good indication of what an item is worth. This does not mean that its always this easy.


Example: Yesterday I bought a Maligaro for 4 gcp and 1 chaos. I will explain how that trade went after this. I put a WTS Maligaro 1 pure exalted offer up, and got whispered right away by a few. Only one was really interested, but did not have the currency. He did however, propose a trade with his Tabula Rasa for my gloves. When checking the price, I found 9 threads with prices between 1,5 ex and 3 ex. Problem was, that they were all verified. None of them actually sold. So, this concluded the following for me: perceived value of the item is around 2 exalted, but no one is currently interested in a luxury item like that (I consider this a leveling chest). Do I take the risk, or ask him to sell it himself and give me a exalted afterwards? I opted for the latter. Within an hour, he whispered me again after selling the Tabula Rasa for 1 pure exalted and 4 gcp. I lost out on  currency, because I was not willing to take the risk. The loss in currency did give me new information about the item. By asking for how much he sold it for, I now have a reference point in case a new player is selling a Tabula Rasa. I will now buy any Tabula that is priced under 1 exalted, until the market shows me this isnt a good item to buy anymore.


**Buying and selling items**

Selling an item requires 3 simple steps:

- Set a price

- Make a forum post (either a auction or a non-negotiable wts page), poe.xyz is your friend

- Link the item once every hour in the trade channel


Out of these 3, setting a price is the most important step. The ancient ""offer me"" is horrible and will often backfire. If you ask me ""offer me"" when selling an item you obviously already have a price in mind for, I will lowball you. Every. Single. Time. Not only do you get horrible offers, you also close the window for a real negotiation. Instead, just offer a fair price. If they pass, just find another buyer or adjust your price. It's okay that it takes some time, you are in no hurry. When buying, the same rules apply. Set a maximum price in mind, and go with that. Let's use the Tabula Rasa. If someone is selling one, just ask: how much. If they say ""offer"", you say 3-4 gcp. If they ask for 1 exalted 2 gcp, you either start negotiating to get it under 1 exalted, or you pass. It's very easy and also very effective. Dont waste time on this, just ask once and get a reply. If the price is right, it's easy money. If the price isnt to your liking, you just lost 1 minute. Who cares, you where playing the game while asking anyway.


Because its getting pretty long and I am cutting everything short already, I will add one more very short bonus paragraph.


**FOTM (crafting)** 

If you are a little up to date, you will realize upcoming flavor of the month builds/items. Lots of topics about sporkers in reddit, new Kripp video or a buff to a skill? Get niche items that are good for that build. FOTM in Anarchy is Kripp's new build. Searing Touches went for 1-3 chaos before this happened. They will now go for 2-3 gcp easily. Check poe.xyz. No 5l yet? Craft one! It's one of the only times where crafting is actually profitable (assuming it takes you an average of 150 fusings and 100 jewellers). People are lazy and want things fast, so finding those gaps in the market can be very profitable!


**Closing** 

So, sorry for the wall of text. This turned out to be way longer than expected, while cutting down on every topic already. Depending on how this is going to be received, I might go more in dept in certain topics. Also remember, this is just my opinion. This is an opinion based economy, and every single one counts and affects this. Mine is just as right and wrong as the next!

PS. English is my third language. I tried to translate certain words to English, but they might lose meaning or failed in translating it. Also, if I made any grammatical/spelling errors, please point this out in a PM. I never write such things in English, so learning from my mistakes is the best way to improve.

EDIT: after rereading my post I did not go that much in dept of flipping items. This was the main reason why I actually wrote it in the first place. I could do this in the future, if people want to read this.

One of the first things that really impressed me when playing POE for the first time. I wasn't dwelling into some cartoonish, colorful and well lit dungeon (*the undead loves the light so much right?*)where monsters at normal difficulty could not pose a problem for me. Quite the opposite. Though the game is hard, I love running aimlessly into a room only to be greeted by the undead army who all take parts in squatting at my corpse. I am too conditioned to be hand held through a game in normal difficulty that POE feels like a refreshing bucket of cold water back into the earlier days of gaming and difficulty. Even when I think I've began facerolling, some monster will eventually slap me all the way back into town for another walk of shame back to the dungeon door.

And as i was going into the next floor down I had an amazing idea. For a really late game map they should have a tower map, say they make it 60-100 floors or something ridiculous. It starts off really easy, maybe some skellys and some other stuff and it just keeps escalating until you're eventually fighting a full room of 8 stat golems that one shot you if you're not a top tier player. but you could stop any time of course. (you wouldn't be forced to lose your character.)Then maybe put a boss room every like 5-10 floors.

You could roll stats on the map also (just like any other map). There could even be a legendary version of the map. Since this map would be to overpowered to farm there would only be one portal per person, so if there are three people in the group there would be three portals at the start and if someone left party before the portal was taken it goes away. If someone joins before any of the other players enter the map another portal would open. However if someone enters the map there are a set number. In other words you only get one inventory to take back with you. (No over farming) this map would obviously drop the top tier gear (ilvl 77-79) once you got into the higher levels of the dungeon, and dropping lower level gear (ilvl 66ish)in the beginning levels of the dungeon.

Just a thought, but i feel like there is really something here. Feel free to post suggestions I will totally take a look! :)

As you may or may not remember, I previously offered up my Diamond Item design up to be a Reddit Community inspired item. In a previous thread, people posted their thoughts, ideas, and concepts.

This thread can be viewed [here:]( http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17i11n/discussion_reddit_community_designed_item/)

Please see the e-mail below from design team member Carl Devisser, who kindly responded to my e-mails a few days ago.

&gt; Hi,

&gt; This is the email we normally send initially, I am happy to post it to the Reddit thread and do any discussion there instead:

&gt; First off, on behalf of everyone at Grinding Gear Games,
we want to offer my deepest thanks for your incredibly generous
support of Path of Exile.  When we started on this journey more than
five years ago, we never dreamed that our little company would be
where it is today.  The public response we've received for Path of
Exile has exceeded our wildest expectations.  We are flattered by the
praise, and encouraged by the enthusiasm of our fans.  We feel a deep
responsibility to deliver the best game that has ever been made in the
action RPG Genre, and people like you are making that possible.

&gt; As we are sure you know, one of the perks of the ""Diamond"" donation is a chance to design your own, in-game Unique item!  We really intend for this to be an open ended process, and we're eager to help you get started.

&gt; When making a unique item it is possible to start out with for example an theme based on the name (for example death's harp), or start out in a specific gameplay situation (Voll's armour preserving a gameplay style of an old patch). You can start out in pretty much any way you like, but there's a few questions that are generally useful to know when making a unique item.

&gt; 1. What type of base item  type would you want it to have?

&gt; 2. What sort of theme and mods are you looking for on the item? Do you want something fire-oriented maybe? Or something based on leeching? It's a pretty open design space, so make any suggestions you think of.

&gt; 3. What level would the unique have? Do you want your unique to be an end-game type thing, or something that people will find and use early in the game?

&gt; 4. Do you want your unique to be universally powerful, or more geared towards a specific type of build? Keep in mind, that as a rule,
Uniques should never outperform the best rares.

&gt; 5. As far as look is concerned, do you have any descriptions or example images of similar things? Being inspired by movies and literature is fine, but for obvious reasons we can't just copy anything that exists elsewhere.

&gt; You might find this thread useful for inspiration as well.
http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/12056

&gt; There are certain limitations on game balance, so we may not be able to implement all of your good ideas. We will try our best however, and we promise you'll be happy with the end result.

&gt; There is no rush on any of this, so please just reply when you have a chance.  Also, we're eager to create your custom-made forum Avatar, so let us know what kind of design you'd like for that, and we'll get started.

&gt; Thank you again for your amazing support of Path of Exile.  Players
like you not only make the production of the game possible, but are
also the main reason we began work in the first place.

&gt; Many thanks from the whole Grinding Gear Games team!

As you can see from this message, there are several things to consider. After reviewing the previous thread, I came to a decision that the best way to design an item was to have people put forward their ideas, and vote on those ideas rather then vote on every aspect of the item. I feel this will make the item feel much more cohesive and less cobbled together.

Item suggestions from the other thread:

**Item Suggestions So Far**

**1) Reddit Helm (Needs a name) /u/shadowclaimer**

&gt; From the other thread we had discussed the idea for a Unique helmet to represent the community and how much we help each other.
Effectively the Helmet would be based on the Gladiator Casque (Level 18), be White with Red around the eyes. It'd have a Unique Level of 18-20.

&gt; Stats it would have:
&gt; Increased Armor (Its ""scaling"" stat)
&gt; Maximum Life
&gt; Life Regeneration
&gt; Other Party Members get +10% Experience
&gt; Conduit (Share Charges with Party Members)

**2) ohbi idea (Needs a name) /u/ohbi**

&gt; I was thinking of something similar in idea Facebreakers with the quirky side of things, with a quick example of a mechanic would be to come up with a way for a empty handed caster melee, cast speed = attack speed, % of mana = % dmg bonus. Obviously that idea would need padding out properly, but thats the area I was thinking.

**3) Staff of Consensus /u/alrightandrew**

&gt; My contribution: ""The Staff of Consensus."" A staff with maybe the ends looking subtly like arrows? As for unique effect: increases attack power at full health, increases block/armour at low health

**4) Ring/Ammy /u/tylergalaxy**

&gt; Well, I think it should be an item that all classes can use, namely a ring, ammy or helm. having effects like + to all resist, +to stats, exp boost and maybe some stuns on hit, life leech, Increased crit, etc would be perfect.

**5) Predditor Claw /u/Condon**

&gt; The Predditor Claw Weapon 
&gt; Applies blue slow debuff on target, reducing speed by 20% While targets are debuffed, player speed increases 5% per stack. This may have an orange effect. Fill in appropriate stats as required.

**6) Shield Book /u/spreadtheirentrails**

&gt; A shield that is a book, mainly for magic-based characters. (needs name) 
&gt; +X% Elemental damage 
&gt; +X% Faster Cast Rate 
&gt; +5% Experience Only 
&gt; the best who moderated Wraeclast have read it [reddit] Or something along those lines.

7) Ideal Tinder /u/_buch
&gt; Ideal Tinder (Anagram of Reddit Alien) 
&gt; Strapped Leather Armor (Or one of the ES shields?) 
&gt; +10% to Fire Damage 
&gt; -20% to Fire Resistance 
&gt; Grants Frenzy Charges To Party Members On Killing Blow 
&gt; ""The witch hunt never actually ceases, but waits another day.

**8) Crown of the Hivemind /u/soulefood**

&gt; Energy Shield Based 
&gt; +20 intelligence Blue 
&gt; gems equipped have +1 
&gt; lvl Red and Green gems equipped have -1 lvl 
&gt; +Maximum Life 
&gt; +All Resist

**9) Bow and Arrow (Needs a name) /u/durkdurkdurk**

A bow that shoots fire arrows (upvotes) and cold arrows (downvotes) randomly.

**10) Rare Map**

&gt; item rarity X% 
&gt; item quantity X% 
&gt; players are cursed by critical weakness 
&gt; no health/mana from potions 
&gt; there are 2 unique boss mobs (together) 
&gt; rare packs are 2x as big 
&gt; maps drop 2x as much

**11) Topaz Ring**

There's plenty of times -- like 5 minutes ago -- where I had to break away from *just* entering the Ancient Pyramid for the first time to feed my kid, usually takes ~20-30 minutes. Don't get me wrong, I like feedin' my kid, it's awesome. Only downside is when I'm done, my Portals have evaporated.

Now, to be honest, it's not *that* much of a hassle to replay a level of a dungeon, or pop a Quicksilver and haul ass to somewhere, but ... my gaming time is *extremely* limited, which comes with being a dad, and hey, I signed on for that. 

I also understand that it's not the Dev's problem to make QoL changes based on the fact I chose to reproduce, but maybe there's something I'm missing?  I mostly solo in little chunks once the wife and kid are sleeping, so I don't have too many long uninterrupted sessions.

I wanted to test a theory, so I spent the last 3 weeks collecting information. 

Theory: Docks has a MUCH larger loot table than Ledge, Therfore when IIR/IIQ is boosted, the smaller pool of items from Ledge will result in much higher quantity of rare items, but lower quality. 

I have no values to go off of in terms of how many total items are in each item pool for each area, but here is what I found out

DATA COLLECTED:

(All runs were done on a FP Mara - Running 141 IIQ and 316 IIR with 1300DPS) 

Docks: 100 runs - Yielded a total of 348 rare items - 7 uniques (one of which was a 14/66 Andy)

Of those 348 Rares I was able to sell 27 of them for 1GCP or more*

Ledge: 100 runs - Yielded a total of 595 rare items - 11 uniques

Of those 595 Rares I was able to sell 11 of them for 1GCP or more*

*When I sell an item - I start at about 150% of what I think it is worth, and slowly move down in trade chat until someone buys it. These are the items that were sold for at least a GCP using that method, so some may have been worth ALOT more.

I am going to do the same thing again, collecting ALOT more data this time. Here is what I want to get total numbers on:

Total number of each Tier of item (i.e rare Imperial bow VS rare Thicket bow)

Total number of currency items (after vend. rares and collecting everything off the ground)

Total time/Average time it takes to complete 1 run - Used to calculate rares per hour.

What I would like to know from the Reddit community is what else do you think would make this most helpful. What data would you like to see in a farming guide on a large scale?

Also, thanks to the rest of the players for making it a fun night, and especially to Charan for paying for the drinks.

I heard some really interesting things, either in one-on-one talks or in a group, and I don't think they've been posted here yet. I feel like Chris and Eric would be happy for these things to be shared, and personally I feel bad ""hoarding"" the info, as there are some really cool features coming:

* There will be a microtransaction feature that lets you transfer the appearance of one item onto another.

This will either be a single-use consumable for around 50 cents, or a reusable effect for around $10-15 (I think that was the figure). The reusable effect would only work for a single item at a time, so to change the appearance of multiple items, you would need to buy multiple copies of the tool. Altered items will need to be restored before trading, to prevent people from trading items they've purchased.

* Act 4 will mostly be indoors. Eric didn't want to reveal much else, but when pressed further, he mumbled something about dungeons. But, don't take this as gospel. As I commented below:

&gt; When I think about it, there's reason to think that Eric may not have meant this in such a strong sense. I mean, perhaps he just meant that a the parts of act 4 that have been designed are mostly indoors.
He did say that they'll have more concept artists working on Act 4 when Act 3x is complete, implying that a lot of Act 4 is yet to be designed. So who knows, maybe they know from the get-go that they want Act 4 to be more of a dungeon crawl, or maybe they've started designing some dungeons and Eric was simply referring to this.
Considering the current acts, it seems likely that future acts will have a pretty good balance between indoors and outdoors. Who knows though. Either way, I can't wait!

* There will be new kinds of passives on the tree. Eric mentioned something about more hybrid nodes, including nodes with ""x damage on Low Life"" around Ranger. Also, Eric made it sound like the tree is still very much a work-in-progress, so expect a lot of changes.

* There may be plans for flying microtransaction pets. This will take time though, as the flying creatures would need more intricate pathing, like flying in loops etc. rather than hovering in one spot.

* Melee splash is being discussed internally --- expect some changes at some point.

* Chris has an idea for smarter rubberbanding behaviour to help with desync (not sure if this is news)

* There are ideas to change the way small obstacle layouts will be generated, to help with movement skills such as Cyclone.

I.e. small obstacles like rocks will be lower in density, or grouped together in higher densities, so that there are more clear spaces.

* Chris hates doorways. Edit: he meant this in the context of desync. It sounds like new levels will be designed with desync issues more in mind.

* There's going to be a new monster in the Dark Forest. When I asked if it's the Bear Skeleton as seen in descent, Eric said it's much cooler!

Edit: Just remembered Eric said the monster is in one of the trailers, so it's most likely the [scary spider-thing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?&amp;v=ZycHZmvy2n0#t=47s) (thanks Cilibinarii for locating this clip).

* The boss fight in 3X is going to be very hard, and it will feature some new skills that haven't been seen yet. Also, these skills will be applied to existing monsters, to improve the current content.

You can set up rules to match (with wildcards) and get notifications if anyone posts anything on tradechat that matches your rules.

This doesn't alter your game in any way, it merely monitors the Client.txt file for trade messages (which gets updated even if you don't display the tradechat in game), as long as you're online.

The main use is for people who want to sell stuff (i.e looking for ""WTB..."" messages), as linked items don't show up in the Client.txt file. It merely shows a ""_"" for them.

You'll find the download and a more in-depth explanation [**here**](https://github.com/Panaetius/PoETradeMonitor).

It's completely free and open-source.

If you have any suggestions or if you find a bug, please open a ticket on that link, instead of posting it here. That way, chances of me noticing and doing something about it are a lot better.

I hope some of you find this useful.

I'm making this post to address and ask you guys a question about how you would like to see this subreddit moderated in the future.

Earlier today I removed a thread that had caused 20 or so reports and multiple messages to be sent. The post in question is here: http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1jopnr/so_i_was_invited_to_magic_find_this_jerkoff/ Note that I only link it for discussion purposes.

I went with my gut feeling on this one because there was no specific rules broken (other than some reddiquette violations). Ie. no personal info was posted.

The reason I am making this post rather than just removing it and continuing on is that it has a very large number of upvotes - which makes the decision to remove much harder. As such I'd like to, away from the heat of argument in that other post, ask you guys how we should moderate drama posts and witch-hunts in this subreddit.

Here are my thoughts:

- Drama posts and witchunts are designed solely to bring negative attention to an individual or group.

- These posts tend to bring out the worst in the sub and can create a divide. 

- Even if these posts are justified there is a strong risk that eventually innocent people can be harmed due to false information or even just overreaction.

- Even if 100% of witchunts are justified, is this the place where they should occur?

- They attract a large number of upvotes from people hungry for drama and can discourage normal discourse.

- People can end up being hurt in real life over doing something in a video game (doxing, ddosing, threats, and even stalking/violence if it goes far enough).

Playing the Devil's Advocate (note that I don't necessarily agree with these, just for discussion's sake):

- The sub has been slow.

- Attention should be called to people that scam/hack/cheat/etc to help other people avoid falling victim. 

- Attention can force change (usually relating to business witch-hunts).

- They can be fun/entertaining. 

****
**So, what are your thoughts? Should posts like the above be allowed in the sub, should they be removed despite attracting a lot of upvotes? Where should mods draw the line?**

****
*Don't just downvote if you disagree with me removing the post today, this is your chance to say why you disagree and to affect future decisions!*

****
Edit: Thanks guys, lots of interesting comments already.

So far it seems the majority opinion is that if the post provides proof of foul play and focuses on arguing on the actions rather than the person themselves it should be allowed.

It seems like a light hand is desired, which is certainly more difficult as myself and other mods will have to make judgement calls on whether proof is enough and whether the post is getting out of hand and might lead to excessive action. It's really tough to think that if we allow posts that call out people that we may end up causing someone innocent (or even guilty) suffering something like death threats, doxing, losing their jobs etc. I have certainly seen similar posts go that way in the past on other subreddits.

The question I'd like to pose is this: If we remove posts more people might get scammed/cheated/etc. If we allow the posts someone might end up having death threats sent to their family members / lose their jobs / have their private info given out. Which is the higher risk in your mind?

****

Results of Comments Thus Far: Due to popular request I'll probably allow future posts that call people out if they do provide evidence and if they are simply for raising awareness or promoting discussion. Please do message mods and file reports if you think things are ever going too far or if your opinions shift. 

And please, do not escalate things beyond damaging someone's rep in the gaming community.

We'd probably also have some sort of trading hub, a chatroom, and finally, ""teams"" you could apply to/join with specific goals in mind -- farming maps, PvP, that sort of thing.

There's also a guild portal for those interested.

That means that people can't purposely block the loot as they don't know where it is (well, unless it's a boss; then they have somewhat of an idea where it dropped but they don't know the exact drop location) or spam click the item and hope that the person that owns the loot lags/de-syncs. 

If that is implemented, it will provide another bonus to the 'competitive' side that everyone who's **against the removal** of the FFA loot system is arguing about as it'll be a test of *who's-got-the-best-reaction-time-besides-the-intended-owner* in order to pick up that item, instead of the current *who-can-luck-out-and-click-on-the-item-first-right-after-the-timer-expires-besides-the-intended-owner* system. This also allows the intended owner to still have a fair chance (as the rest of the party) to get the item if they lagged out/de-synced and fortunately have the problem fixed right in time when the item becomes visible to pick up the item.

Another reason why this system should be implemented is that there is no point showing people, that currently have no access to picking up those items, the items. Seriously, why was that implemented? All it causes is everyone to gather around the item for a clickspamfest.

I myself agree that the FFA looting system needs to be more forgiving to the intended owner in the case if they de-sync or lag however there will always be butthurt people that cannot be persuaded no matter how much logical reasoning you give them. This is why you implement this system, to cater for both sides of the debate.

He was right about a few things.

[Kripparian's video](http://youtu.be/_LDlqnjEeJM) Overkill damage talk time is at 7 mins 30s.

[Dev post #1](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/13706/page/36#p3923214)

&gt;The ability to kill yourself on reflect has nothing to do with leech not happening for ""overkill"". The leeching code literally has no way to determine how much life the enemy has, it couldn't prevent leeching for overkill if we wanted it to without being rewritten to record that info when the damage is dealt. You can and do leech based on how much damage you do to enemies, regardless of their life.

&gt; If Kripparian drew the conclusion that leech doesn't happen for ""overkill"" damage, then he was mistaken.

[Dev post #2](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/439684/filter-account-type/staff)

&gt;No, [reflect] really doesn't, and never has. There isn't any possible way for [reflect] to ""count as the monster damage"", and the monsters stats cannot affect it like that at all. Enfeeble does not have any effect on the damage reflected back to you, unless it's on you and thus affecting the damage you dealt in the first place.

So, the longstanding rumor that enfeeble and +% damage on maps affects damage reflected is false. 

Keep in mind that enfeeble can still cause reflect damage to miss by reducing the enemy's accuracy. I am not sure if reflect damage can still miss if the initial damage was caused by abilities that cannot miss.

Summon Skeletons Skill (INT character lvl10) + Spell Totem Support (STR Character level 31).

You can add in other supports like increased duration and they will affect both the totem and the skellys (neat that supports support supports).

You can also abuse terrain to keep the totem alive. Put him on the high ground like I do in the video and it can cast down while many ranged attacks wont be able to hit it!

Y/N?",Mackinstyle,109,16,50,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/176d32/two_pretty_universal_simple_changes_yn/,"1. When leveling up a gem, there needs to be some very clear, easy way to see what is changing. Why are you asking me to level it up? Do you want me to be aware of how it's changing? The only way I've found to do so is to tediously look at before and after stats of the gem and keep an eye on the numbers. Maybe when I mouse over the level up button, a tooltip appears that only shows the gem and a list of net changes to stats.

2. When I right click an identify scroll to use, the icon is not intuitive. It's just a little icon of the scroll item. You don't apply the scroll physically to an item to identify it, you *use* the scroll's power to identify it. That's why all other games use some sort of ""active"" cursor icon for once you've activated a scroll and are about to use.  This is incredibly minor, but it very immediately stood out as feeling unintuitive and awkward.

3. (added) (EDIT: IM WRONG ABOUT THIS ONE. )  When I accept a gem as a reward. I first pick it up. This makes all my gem slots show up (I have the always show option off).

GGG should add an account option to disable that account's trading for 24 hours if its password were changed. This would mean that if an account was hacked, then it wouldn't be able to trade away all of it's currency/gear for 24 hours. This would give the legitimate owner of the account time to change their password and save their account.

Of course this would be an option so if you don't want this restriction then you could have it disabled. However, the choice would probably need to be permanent so that the hacker wouldn't just change the option before stealing the items.

What do you guys think about this idea?

1344356602.0,86,self.pathofexile,xtv5k,"How to ""Craft"" white items into perfect items.",Panda413,94,8,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/xtv5k/how_to_craft_white_items_into_perfect_items/,"Lots of new players.. Figured I would share what I know. In PoE, you don't need to rely on finding perfect loot, you can just make your own.


**Which white items are worth crafting?**

If you look at the main webpage, you can get a [list of all the base weapons and gear](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data). You want to look at this to know what you are going for. Generally every 10 levels or so, there are 3 new weapons of each type. One that attacks fast, one that hits hard but slow, and one in the middle. For gear, there are pure armor/evasion/energy shield and hybrids of each duo combination. You want to know the names of the ones you should be looking for around your level based on your build.

*Tip: Vendors sell white items cheap, in later levels they sometimes even have perfect sockets and links. Once you get to the last difficulty, check act 1 and 2 vendor every time you level. (that is when the vendors get new stock) You might find a 6 socket item. Even if you don't need it, BUY IT! You can trade it to another player, or trade it to the vendor for 7 jewelers orbs!*

**Sockets and links**

Next, look for sockets. You want as many linked sockets as possible. On a bow or 2h weapon,.that is 6. But is super rare. 5 is excellent. All other weapons and Shields only have 3 max sockets. Gear is 4 max except chest armor, those can have 6. (no sockets on belts, rings, amulets, quivers) You really want to find perfect sockets and links. You don't want to use fusing or jewelers. Even if it is one link away from perfect, your first fusing could result in 0 links. There is no advantage to almost perfect sockets. Save fusing/jewelers for when you find a rare/unique and want to change the sockets. If the colors are wrong, that's okay. Using chromatics for this is fine.. But wait until you roll perfect stats. No advantage to using chromatics while the item is still white. Unlike the next step...

*Tip: You can see the sockets and links for each item on the ground without rolling over them. There are little colored squares that show the sockets and if you look close you can see the links too.* 

*Tip #2: Any item with RGB linked sockets can be traded for a chromatic orb at any vendor.*

**Quality upgrade**

Once you find a white item appropriate for your level and build with good sockets, you add stats to it. First, use blacksmith or armorers orb to 20% quality. You only need to use 4x to upgrade a white item to 20% versus 20x on a piece already yellow. This is one big advantage of crafting whites. 

*Tip: Use glassblower orbs on flasks late in the game to get more regen and longer duration on diamond/granite. You can treat flasks just like gear. But right now there are no rare flasks, just use magic type orbs on them. ~~Rare coming I've heard.~~*

**Adding stats**

Adding stats can be done a couple different ways depending on your orbs. In beta, feel free to test and play with whatever, but on release, you'll want to save all your best orbs for lvl 60+. You can use transmutation orb to convert to blue, then alteration to change stats. If you get one good stat like increased damage, you can use augmentation to add a stat. You can do the same with rares by using alchemy, chaos, exalted (very rare). You can even upgrade to the exact blue stats you want, then use regal to upgrade to rare, then use exalted to add one new stat at a time. Which stats you want is up to you and dependent in your build.

Also, there is the orb of chance. This can turn a white item into a blue, yellow, or unique. From what I've read, the odds to get a rare are about 1:5. Unique is very rare, probably 1:100+. Only certain base items have a unique associated with them, so make sure to only use orb of chance on those.. Just in case.

Then there is also blessed and divine orb which can reroll the values on some stats of a currently existing item. You need to be very familiar with which values are rerolled and what their min/max is to use this effectively. 

You can use orb of scouring to remove all stats and make your item white again but retain it's sockets, links, colors. This way you can use another alchemy instead of a chaos. However, you can trade scouring for regret from vendor. So if you ever want to respec, or have regrets handy for trade when other people want to respec, I wouldn't use scouring when crafting very often.

[Here is a page describing the functions of all the currency items](http://www.pathofexile.com/item-data/currency)

...

Now you have perfect gear! (assuming you had a few hundred orbs or very good luck)

Now seems as good a time as any to post it.  Some of these have been mentioned on the forums before, so lots of credit to the community for some of these ideas.  Ignore exact numbers/balancing, these are just general ideas.

Support Skills

* **Summon Melee Golem** (STR support).  Summons a mobile ally who uses supported attack skill.  Still considered a 'totem' in terms of mechanics (only 1 allowed, not a minion, affected by Ancestral Bond).
* **Channeling** (STR support).  Life leech, mana leech, charges, debuffs pass through totems/golems (minions?) to player at X% reduced effectiveness.
* **Riposte** (DEX support).  Supported attack skill can only be used after successful melee block.  X% more attack speed.
* **Dueling** (INT support).  Supported spell can only be used after successful spell block.  200% more cast speed.
* **Malice** (INT support).  Supported curse becomes an aura, afflicting all nearby enemies.  30% mana reserved, 75% less area of effect.
* **Concentrated Duration** (STR support).  X% reduced duration, Y% increased effectiveness.  Not exactly sure how this would work out due to the extreme variety of duration skills, but still seems interesting to me.

Active Skills

* **Mana Well** (INT active).  100% of damage done is leeched back as mana.  Alternative to everyone using Clarity/Regen, as this promotes max mana while quickly stopping to manually regen.  Exact mechanics up for grabs (could be channeled, targeted AoE, DoT, whatever).
* **Singularity** (INT active).  Pulls nearby enemies towards a central point.

Existing mechanics as support gems:

* **Ghost Reaver**
* **Conduit**
* **Resolute Technique**

New Keystones:

* **Storm Shield**.  Energy shield shatters when depleted, dealing X% of maximum energy shield as lightning+cold damage to surrounding enemies.  This has greatly increased chance to shock, freeze, stun.
* **Aspect of the Wurm**.  All life leech is divided equally between energy shield and life, 50% more life leeched. (if full life or full shield, leech only has 75% total effectiveness).

edit: couple notes.

* Riposte/Dueling -- wasn't sure on what bonuses these should provide, or what % chance to trigger they would have.

1362432209.0,88,self.pathofexile,19ntvi,Strength is over-powered in comparison to dexterity and intelligence,U_DONT_KNOW_TEAM,139,51,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/19ntvi/strength_is_overpowered_in_comparison_to/,"First lets address what you get for each of the stats:

**10 Str**:

+5 Health  
+2% Melee physical damage

**10 Dex**:

+20 accuracy  
+2% Evasion

**10 Int**: 

+5 mana  
+2% energy Shield

The leading cause for strength being so strong is the **FLAT** health. This is more surviveability in the early to midgame than +2% energy shield which is the point in the game where you are lacking in good gear and thus rely on surviveability from the passive tree. 

For a comparison lets look at you at 200 health/ES,400 health/ES, 1000 Health/ES with an assumed +50%/100%/+150% from other nodes. 

**200 health/ES +50%**

10 strength will give you 7.5 health

10 intelligence will give you 4 ES

**400 health/ES +100%**

10 str will give you 10 health

10 int will give you 8 ES

**1000 health/ES +150%**

10 str will give you 15 health

10 int will give you 20 ES

What this tells us is that surviveability-wise, it is not till endgame that Int starts out preforming strength. And this is assuming you are sacrificing the massive amounts of armor/evasion you would have to to get enough energy shield. 

Now lets look at the offensive aspects of the two.

**+5 mana vs +2% melee physical damage** 

While the + mana will be nice on the int earlygame, after you have clarity you will not have mana issues excluding a few niche builds. The physical damage however is useful for everyone but spellcasters (due to the wonderful iron grip keystone). 


It seems pretty straightforward that in their current iterations, strength has a leg up on intelligence (and IMO could use a rebalancing especially after they fix melee). 

**At this point you are probably asking yourself ""What happened to dexterity?!?!"". Well I didn't include dexterity yet because I don't have a good benchmark for what your evasion is at early, mid and late game. So I couldn't calculate out the effective health/ES it gives you.** 

However I will note that +20 accuracy seems weaker than it should be due to how strong resolute technique/lioneye's glare is. 

Please discuss/refute.

Hi Guys,

My brother and I decided to develop a tool to make this task a little bit easier. Please have a look, and hopefully it saves you a lot of time too.

This tool allows you to select an item type and view all the attributes that can be rolled broken down into prefixes and suffixes.

One step further, you can also specify existing attributes to limit your results. This makes finding the remaining attributes on an item happen in seconds.

Please feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, or inaccuracies.

Thanks for reading!

There are already unique maps, flask and (obviously) gear. But there are no unique gems.  
So lets throw in this thread some ideas about what could unique gem possibly add to this game.  
I'll start first:  

* Change [portal](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Portal) skill gem rarity to Unique. It's already rare, so let it be shinny when it drop.
* Following portal gem idea, why not create wisdom gem (identify items after some casting time).
* Im always sad when I see 6S 5L item. That 6th socket seems so useless. Lets create gear support gem. For example ""Item socketed with this gem will grant 10% more health."". Obviously this needs some restrictions ; you cannot put two same type gear support gems inside single item. Imagine 1000ES 6S chest with 6x ""10% more energy shield from this item"" - thats game breaking.
* There are some effects that are available in game only from unique gear (+mana per hit) or single passive in whole passive skill tree (+2 melee range). Why not make them as unique support gems?
  
Well, thats a lot of unique gems. But you cannot use orb of chance on gems.. or can you? Lets create sink for regular gems. Selling a gem to a vendor would give you 1 gem shard instead of 0.2 scroll of wisdom. 20 gem shards would combine into a blank gem. You could use orb of transmutation to get some random gem or.. chance it!

1359478820.0,81,self.pathofexile,17i4xg,Just found this game. SO DEEP.,Valdearg20,115,34,98,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/17i4xg/just_found_this_game_so_deep/,"So I randomly stumbled across this game last night and figured that I'd give it a try. Being free to play, it's not like I had anything to lose, right? I downloaded it, started a templar, and got a few hours of gameplay in last night. 

My initial thoughts are that the customization and character design in this game are so deep. Once I got my first level, I quite literally stared at the skill tree (map?) for 20 minutes, just trying to get the scope of it all. Combine that with the skill system and you've got yourself an almost overwhelming number of choices as far as developing your character goes. Simply staggering. 

There aren't very many games where you can roll a holy warrior archetype character and, by level 5, have him shooting lightning, bashing things with a glacial strike, AND summoning zombies all at once. It's kind of nuts, haha. 

In all honesty, I have NO idea where to proceed as far as my skill allocation is concerned. Usually, this would bother me, because I really enjoy min/maxing and creating the ""perfect"" build. I think that due to the scope of the character development system, however, finding that one build is all but impossible. This allows me to experiment and actually have fun making these builds (and even entertain some ridiculous options), rather than obsessing over everything and trying to find the one ""true"" build for each class. (Note: I am open to advice, however, since I've got no idea what to expect in the later difficulties!)

Other things I like about the game: The potion/flask system, the barter system (The lack of a set currency, like gold, is an interesting choice. A departure from traditional design that may pay off in the long run, but I'll have to see as I play more), and the visual ""feel"" of the game so far.

Things I don't like: The inability to remap your mouse functions in game. I find it awkward to try to hit the middle mouse button, at times. If I could re-map that skill trigger to a thumb button, it would be amazing. Other than that, it's only the minor annoyance that I never seem to have enough Scrolls of Wisdom to keep up with the number of unidentified items that drop. Then again, it's early, and I'd imagine they become more common as you progress.

Overall, from the small amount I've seen thus far, this is a GREAT spiritual successor to the Diablo franchise of my youth. Seeing as Blizzzard royally screwed the pooch with regard to Diablo 3, I'm quite happy to have discovered this game. It looks and feels very much like I had imagined Diablo 3 should have been. In fact, the character development system is far beyond anything I could have imagined, so in some ways, it's even better.

TLDR:

- I'm aware that it's kind of ugly
- I'm aware that it's lacking features
- I'm aware that there are probably a lot of bugs
- You submit build videos and people upvote them for glory

Features that I already plan on adding:

- Add a primary_skills attribute to the submissions so that players can search for builds based on particular skills
- User home pages featuring all of their submissions/likes
- Create a quick link so that you can instantly share your submission on reddit/poe forums.


HELLO! It's the original poeex guy and I made a new website. I've kind of dropped off from playing POE for a while, but I keep coming back here to view some of the crazy builds that people are STILL coming up with. 

Since GGG had ended their Build of the Week series, I messaged Chris a few months ago asking if I could create something like this. He seemed to like the idea and now here we are.

Over the past few days, I've been working on this website which is now at least functional. It's pretty ugly, but it works.

As a precursor to the first round of submissions, will begin on June 4th at midnight UTC, I've added all of the original series so that you can test out the site.

Please let me know what you think - constructive criticism is very much appreciated. What can I do to make the site function/look better?

EDIT: AFK for like 3 hours

EDIT 2: 8:02 PM PST. Can't work on this tonight, but thank you for the feedback. I'll start improving the site tomorrow!

EDIT 3: 12:28 PM PST Sunday. Thanks for all the feedback. Hoping to have it all done before the first round starts!

****

**Background**

Just before open beta [I had my subscribers choose a build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnAaBniwHk8) from three different build options that I would then proceed to level as far as I could in a week. The end goal was to provide levelling recaps at level's ~20 &amp; 40 (to show how the build levels) and then to provide a full guide to the build at it's state by the end of the week.

****

**Full Build Guide**

Well, I was a little late due to a bumpy first half of the week but it's finally here!

[BotW #1 BM Bow Duellist (Or Marauder) Full Build Guide (Lvl 63)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGZmFo-nZmM)

****

**Levelling Recaps**

- [Level 20](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOkyTeQnpRo)
- [Level 40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBTAbp9uGuk)

My idea with these was that often build guides just show the finished product and leave out important things in the levelling process (like LA templar's using sweep to level for the first 20-40 levels).

I only had to make a few modifications from his super efficient route to support my playstyle a little better. The passive tree linked is current state not end game goal! I do plan on getting resolute technique, the armor from marauder and the life from the templar! */u/ninoffmaniak actually commented that it would be one point more efficient to come up from lava lash rather than to go from the center, so consider that if you plan on using this tree!*

Skills include:

- Fire Arrow [Weapon Elemental Dmg + Added Fire Dmg + Fire Penetration]
- Split Arrow [chain + weapon elemental dmg + faster attacks or life gain on hit in harder zones]
- Poison arrow [increased duration]
- Projectile Weakness [increased duration]
- [Skelly brotem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJqd1CfRcQ)
- Anger / Wrath / Grace and anything else you like that isn't % res.

Modus Operandi:

AoE - Curse enemies and apply posion arrow (piercing) through them. Split Arrow pierces some and then chains increasing overall amount of hits. Knockback keeps them in posion aoe as does skelly brotem.

Single target - skelly brotem and shootem till they's ded.

That's all I can think to put in a summary without going into too much detail but feel free to ask questions about the build here or on YT and I will respond (possibly after sleeping).

As many of you know, the more information shared with a community, the better able that community is to create and manage a multitude of sites and services to share their information and experiences. For instance, EVE's incredibly robust development API has resulted in resources for everything from skill planning to ship loadouts, damage calculators and marketplace managers. Just imagine what we could do if the developers expanded the API for Path of Exile!

If you'd like to support me in the hopes that the devs will read and respond to my request, you can do so simply be replying here on Reddit, or in [my thread](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/419354) on the forums.

Thanks,

My forum post:
&gt; As it stands, Path of Exile's current [developer API](http://www.pathofexile.com/developer/docs/api) is incredibly lacking in its functionality and accessibility. I believe this to be a hindrance to potential 3rd party sites and services, and I hope you'll support me in calling on the developers to improve and expand upon the current API in order to support the creation and longevity of communities built around such works.

&gt; I recently began work on a website relating to Path of Exile, about which I was incredibly excited. The site will be trade-related, as many people have expressed their aversion to the trade forums as they currently stand, and the difficulty browsing for and finding the items they want and need. Imagine my surprise when I found that not only is the retrieval of character and item data not publically available, but simple queries such as searching by character name are also unavailable to us, or are otherwise undocumented.

&gt; I have high hopes for the potential expansion of the Path of Exile community in the case that the developers improve the API available to us. It is my hope that the developers have the chance to read this and provide their feedback on these issues, and that they are able to improve the developer API in the near future in order to facilitate a bigger, stronger community based around the game and its fans.

**Edit:** Why the downvotes? Is an improved developer API not something you believe is needed or wanted? Please don't downvote my thread simply because you don't understand why it is important to those of us who choose to develop sites and services for the benefit of the communities of our favorite games.

1364978972.0,75,self.pathofexile,1bksoi,Why Magic Find on items is a Game Design Anti-pattern,kowsosoft,169,94,157,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1bksoi/why_magic_find_on_items_is_a_game_design/,"This probably isn't going to be a popular idea, but I feel like we're enough iterations into the ARPG genre that we can start questioning some of the assumptions the genre's built on. The first one I'd like to tackle is Magic Find. To clarify the title above, an anti-pattern is a business or design pattern that is commonly used but is in fact ineffective or counter-productive. It's a formalized version of a 'bad habit', if you will.

I have two reasons for thinking Magic Find is problematic:

1) It is a meta-stat, and meta-stats encourage players to gear backwards or sub-optimally.

2) It tends to scale at an unbelievable rate.


For the sake of this thread, a meta-stat is any stat that doesn't actually affect your character's game play or performance, such as MF, GF, IIR, IIQ, Increased/Decreased Exp%, etc.

While stats like these do have a place, I don't think that place is on gear. Ultimately, the decision to wear Magic Find gear often comes at the expense of offensive (and sometimes defensive) effectiveness. In other words, players deliberately wear worse gear to accommodate their Magic Find stat.

This is dumb. If I have a great item, I shouldn't be discouraged from wearing it! This genre is built on loot and the joy of getting good loot. To the extent that this statement is true from ARPG to ARPG, it's bad design to encourage players to pass on stuff that makes them better.

The second problem is the scaling. It's very easy in Diablo 3, for example, to get around 100% Magic Find without any NV buffs. This seems innocuous, but the problem is that 100% Magic Find is the equivalent of doubling your overall damage output. You aren't actually killing anything faster, but you're getting 2x as much loot from the things you do kill. Let me repeat the operative point here: If you could increase your damage effectiveness by 100% for relatively cheap, would you do it? Of course. That's what magic find simulates. Even numbers like 25-30% would be really impressive, and you can get values like that off of single items in PoE. Also, IIR and IIQ scale off of each other, making the scaling issue even worse in PoE.


So to sum it up, Magic Find is bad because (1) it encourages sub-optimal builds, and (2) because its scaling is completely overwhelming.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,hardcore,True,t3_1bksoi,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1bksoi/why_magic_find_on_items_is_a_game_design/,

However, most players (probably all, even) will agree that it is near useless, as the damage reflection is WAY too underwhelming. It is barely noticeable, and it doesn't even scale with the item the 'thorn' property is on. 

I noticed this whilst watching [Kripp's video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7Pk1pEKh7I) where, at the beginning he rolls a shield he deems horrible, probably because one of the three properties was a 'thorn' property. If you see, it only reflects 7 damage to melee attackers. 

What makes damage reflection so underwhelming is that:

1. The damage reflection does not scale no matter what depending on the level of the item, the item level of the item nor the damage you took.

2. It only applies to melee attackers
3. It does not have a variant for spells

The 'thorn' property is in a very bad state right now, but to make it viable again the issues listed above should be addressed, with the issues being listed in descending order of importance (issue 1 is more important than 3). I am not saying that all three issues should be addressed, nor that every item with the thorn property should all reflect damage from all attackers (not just melee) but it would be nice to see different variants of thorn to apply to ranged attackers and spell damage.

Hello Diamond Supporters!

0.10.4B was released last week, including 3 diamond unique items:

*Bronn’s Lithe* (Zinger86)

*Carcass Jack* (Carkasjak)

*Rise of the Phoenix* (Jarchan)

as well as the GGG unique Rainbowstride.

This set of four was focussed on endgame utility, and I look forward to seeing how they will be used in various builds.

Today Jonathan and Chris have returned from GDC. They spent their time at GDC in various meetings and parties. Chris will be doing a write up about their GDC experiences soon.

This week also sees the end of the one week race, which is always interesting (and the data generated is especially useful). We are also coming into the final week of Season One of race events. We have learned a lot from this first season. We want to improve things a lot, and a add a lot, for Season Two.

**0.10.5**

This patch will be out later this week, including the three new supports.

As well as the supports, there will be another batch of unique items, including at least two Diamond Supporter items. Unique items from Sleekray and QixunZ26 will be in. For the third Diamond Unique we are hoping to get one of the two delayed maps in.

The issues they have are tied to what makes them special, we are very keen to get the issues resolved and let you see these maps!

**Insider Info**

This week’s insider info is directly related to unique items. As you know, currently in the game when you have a unique item it has a 2d icon, however the 3d artwork on the character and the ground is that of the basetype.

Adding 3D artwork for unique items is underway, but is a huge task. As well as the items being rendered in high definition 3d, low resolution versions need to be created and rigged to all characters.

Here is an image of some of the 3d artwork:

It uses the wiki information of each skill and gem currently present in the game.  This information is then referenced on the final sheet that lets you choose a combination of skill and support gems.

Here's the dropbox link: [Skill Cost Spreadsheet v1.0](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6427370/PoE_Cost_Calc_v1.0.xlsx)

I understand that this is a pretty limited tool, but I really think it can help if you are trying to plan out a build that utilizes high cost skill combinations.  I don't plan on expanding the purpose of this document any further, but suggestions are welcome!

Please read the disclaimer and instructions before use.  The data only reflects what is shown on the wiki at this point in time and can easily be changed when new patches occur.

Also, please note that the Compatibility Matrix sheet was not created by me and seems very outdated and/or incorrect.  The purpose of this sheet was to inform if each support gem was compatible with the selected active gem.  For now, please take that with a grain of salt since from what I can tell it is far from complete/correct.  But the main purpose of this spreadsheet was to determine the cost of a very specific skill combination such as:  **How much mana is spent if I have 20% mana cost reduction from passives and I cast a GMP Fireball, Reduced Mana, Increased AoE spell?**...

At some point in the game, when playing in parties there is always a point where there are too many mobs, too many loot already on ground, or when playing as ranged we just do not see who is the original loot owner. 

Although this might seem irrelevant when playing in public parties, this would extremely useful when playing in a civil way, with your friends.

In terms of in game implementation, it should be simple as the latest patch ""superior"" gem tag update.

**UPDATE**: Just to be clear, I am not suggesting the loot stops being FFA. I enjoy the game loot system. I would just like to have the original owner tag in the item, leaving the decision to the players to knowingly pick or leave items with other people's names on them.

I see many people discussing ffa loot, which was not by any means, the point of this post. This suggestion should not affect negatively anyone.

Literally every CI build I have come across is more surviveable and does more damage if you take away CI and repurpose the ES nodes. 

This comes down to a few factors:

1. Health Nodes give more health than ES nodes give ES. While the weakest of each are both 8%, there are much more larger % health nodes (along with some flat health nodes).

2. Health Nodes are more convenient. To get a good amount of ES you need to venture into the middle of the tree. The middle of the tree (apart from a few keystones) is weak. We all know it. Its filler and should be avoided if possible. 

3. Pure ES gear means no armor/evasion. This means that you will be very squishy against white mobs.

4. ES needs time to regen so its not very good with any build which will be taking damage consistantly (even in small amounts). 

5. Status effects. Since status effects are based upon percentage of health you will be shocked, frozen, chilled, and ignited far more often with CI. 

6. The 50% chance to ignore stuns WILL NOT prevent you from being stunned in most situations. This is because it is more common to take a few hits than simply 1 (except on bosses, and on bosses if you take a hit you are pretty screwed anyway). 

7. ES doesn't work with pots.

8. In order to get ES to work with lifesteal it requires getting another keystone. (I also wonder if the 20% limiter is shifted to ES or stays on health). 

I think ES needs a buff. I think it was over-nerfed in CB due to its appearance of being OP due to the fact that endgame it gives you a much larger pool. This pool has so many downsides that I am not sure it is worth it even if doubled your health. (although if it did it would allow you to go for the hybrid ES/AR or ES/EV). 

Also I don't feel like chaos damage is punishing enough. If it were perhaps I would better understand going CI. As is the only place where CI really helps you is Dread Thicket and Chaos damage maps (which health regen can usually beast through anyway). The flipside to this is that Blood Magic maps are unrunable by CI users. 

Thoughts? Critiques?

We just started playing it yesterday so I haven't mid/high level build examples, I'll just explain the rules.

You start by creating a new character, in Hardcore league, choosing his class randomly (yay 6 classes, can use a dice :D).
Then you play the way you're used to, except when you level up. If you have multiple choices for your next passive node, you must let the fate choose for you.

Each new node will be choosed next to the last node picked if possible. If you reach a dead end, just go backwards until you reach an unexplored path.

The goal is to survive in hardcore without being able to choose your passive tree, so you'll have to adapt your stuff and skills to the nodes choosed by fate. Lots of fun with friends sharing your actual build and wondering what will be next :)

Share your thoughts, try it, have fun playing PoE !

TL;DR : Create a hardcore character, choose his class randomly, each time you level up, choose the next passive node randomly, deal with it :D

EDIT : Some optional rules proposed by solistus in the comments :

* You can skip any keystone and pretend it's a dead end instead. That way, you don't get stuck taking CI if you have Eldritch Battery, etc.
* For nodes that only work with shields, specific weapon types, dual wielding / 2-handed weapons, etc.: you have to take whatever the dice tell you to take up until you're using both your main and alternate weapon slots, then you can skip nodes you won't be able to use. If you've already taken nodes for both 2-Handed Weapons and Dual Wielding, you can skip Shield nodes.
* When you move up in difficulty, you can choose a new spot to branch off from for your next passive placement and then keep going from there. That gives you a couple opportunities to nudge your character in a reasonable direction if you make it that far, and as a neat little bonus, it discourages players from farming levels on a lower difficulty before moving to the next one.
* Your rules don't mention this either way, but: allow use of respec points to reroll a node placement. You still have to roll again, and you might get the same thing or an even worse node, so use wisely. Like RNG crafting for your passives ;)
* edit: oh, and this one may be obvious, but: self drops only would make this a lot more fun, no twinking out your character from shared stash items.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,1360416249.0,,,True,t3_186pwp,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/186pwp/path_of_random/,

It's nice being able to stay in the same channel after changing areas.

But onto the point of the topic. I like to read trade chat in little spurts periodically. I can't play the game with trade chat active all the time. When it's busy it covers too much of the screen (where enemies and their health bars might be) and most importantly, it has a major impact on my framerate. Text seems to have that effect in general when there's a lot of it, but when 20 or more items are being linked in the same visible window simultaneously, it's much worse.

However with the new chat system, I can't hide chat, then uncheck the hide button to see what's been said while I had chat hidden. I'm not actually in the the channel until I display the text. I like being able to hide/unhide at my pleasure without being forced to endure its visibility constantly in order to not miss anything.

I think I would also prefer if it didn't often put you in a new channel after hiding/unhiding chat (or leaving/joining I should say). Sometimes I'll be in a conversation in global chat, but I need to get serious and tackle a tough situation for a couple minutes and don't want a bunch of text in the lower left hand part of my screen distracting me. I'd like to be able to do that and see what was said while I was fighting. But unless I took note of the channel number, I won't be back in that same channel. And I won't be able to scroll up and see what people were saying.

There will be a [couple](http://www.pathofexile.com/seasons) of cutthroat races shortly. Some of them solo, some of them with partying allowed. There will also be 1 HC cutthroat event. If you are new to this type of league please check the rules [here](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/326045). If you have any questions feel free to ask.

Summary of rules:

* This is a separate short-duration league that has its own stash (as usual). At the end of the event, characters and stashed items will be moved to Default.
* There's a PvP damage multiplier because players start with a lot more life than they do damage. This multiplier will be adjusted substantially based on feedback from this event and others.
* Players are hostile by default to players who are not in their party.
* You can ctrl+click on the entrance to an area to use the Instance Management screen to manually enter any other player's instance of an area.
* Cut-throat instances can hold a maximum of 12 players.
* This test is not a hardcore league. When you die, you lose the normal experience penalty for your difficulty plus 30% of your current level. You also drop all inventory and equipped items. Your flasks, skill gems (even ones in your inventory) and quest items are not dropped.
* If you were killed by another player, your lost experience is split among their party.
* If you attempt to abruptly leave the game in a non-town instance, you have to wait 5 seconds and are unable to move or use flasks.
* The grace period of invulnerability upon entering an area is 20 seconds. This should start once the player is mostly done loading.
* Non-partied players only show up on the map if they're nearby.
* There are no notifications for players joining or leaving areas.
* Portals cannot be used until they have been up for five seconds.
* You cannot apply microtransaction effects to items in cut-throat. You may dance and have pets.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,hardcore,True,t3_1c4jeh,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1c4jeh/cutthroat_races_are_coming_up_please_read_the/,

Creating your own *successful* build is difficult and requires a lot of iteration. But if you are willing to follow a pre-planned build then you can bypass all of this to just play the game. If you want something cutting edge or original this isn't really the guide you're looking for.

**[Video Guide: The Easiest Beginner Build - Tanky Blood Magic Lightning Arrow Ranger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eCJs79oLPk8)** &lt;-- All of the following is explained in here in audio/visual format if you prefer that way of learning!

****

****

**The Build: Tanky Blood Magic Lightning Arrow Ranger** 

*Heavily influenced by Petrov's Builds, mad credit to him!*

**Skills:**

- Lightning Arrow - Your main skill. Powerful AoE, high potential damage and great synergy with both Life Gain on Hit and Life Leech supports. This means we can both support the costs of the skill and even heal ourselves by taking the blood magic keystone. Being blood magic also means we can be nice and tanky without really sacrificing any damage.

 - Recommended Supports: Lesser Multiple Projectiles + Life Gain on Hit OR Life Leech + Chain OR Pierce + Faster Attacks + Weapon Elemental Damage. I usually use pierce while levelling and then either buy or find a chain sometime in merciless. Pierce is very strong but chain is a lot easier to use and works better with life gain on hit so it's well worth getting.

- Frenzy or Elemental Hit: Single Target DPS. Frenzy is great all round and available as a quest reward though Elemental hit can be very powerful with a fast bow. The only problem with elemental hit is that it can only be found as a drop, which means you will need to either get lucky or trade for one whenever you have a decent amount of currency.

  - Recommended Support: Faster Attacks + Weapon Elemental Damage + Life Leech + Added *X* Damage

- Wrath + Anger + Grace: All can be supported nicely on blood magic and work well with the build.

- The [Skelly brotem](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzJqd1CfRcQ) OR a Decoy Totem OR a Rejuvenation Totem.

- Enfeeble + Elemental Weakness OR Projectile Weakness. Elemental Weakness is the most popular but I personally prefer Projectile Weakness as it synergizes well with Pierce and can give you a lot more potential damage. You can use proj weakness until you get chain and then switch to ele weakness if you like.

**[The Passive Skill Tree](http://www.pathofexile.com/passive-skill-tree/AAAAAgIAAnEEswUtCC4MfQ48Dq0QfxQgFE0UcRR1GNsZLhmFGY4aOB0UIWAkqiftKLUppTIJMok1kjboNuk6UkCgQapDnEp9TshQR1BQVElVxlYEVvpX4lhjWfNfP2BLYIhhUmOnZp5noGe9cql0QXTtdPF35XrvfNmGYId2jM-PRpBVm42boZ65n8uiAKcIpzCnhKyqr-u4k7ndwBrB2MaextjPZdDQ037Uj91G37_jaudS7Djtg-4O7m_vDu9O8B_yL_ZI9zL46_rS_E78xQ==)** - *Slightly modified from Petrov's build, again major props to him.*

**Gearing:**

- Pure Evasion gear is best! You have some evasion nodes and you will get the most armor from wearing pure evasion gear. That said, if you find a sweet Armor or Armor+EV piece feel free to use it.

- Life! Life! Life! As a blood magic build with a lot of %Life nodes any max life mods you get on your gear will help you a lot.

- Elemental Damage mods and attack speed. These will scale the best and give you massive boosts to damage. You will still also leech from ele damage thanks to the way the Life Leech gem works.

- Avoid Crit chance/multiplier and accuracy. All of these mods are useless thanks to taking Resolute technique.

- Resists are always important. Attempt to max the elemental resists and try to aim for at least 0% chaos resist in merciless. 

- Weapon Elemental Damage mods on jewellery, quivers and belts are great!

***A lot of this should be very familiar to experienced players but hopefully beginners that are struggling will find this helpful.***

Suggested Alternative Easy Builds? Freeze Pulse or Ethereal Knives marauder are both very strong though not quite as simple as an LA BM Ranger, I feel (neither has as easy access to skills/gear as the Ranger does). Check them out if you don't like bows!

1360556629.0,69,self.pathofexile,18ag4b,"I'm working on the ""Support Gem Compatibility"" wiki page and I need your help!",Aeon_Angel,80,11,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/18ag4b/im_working_on_the_support_gem_compatibility_wiki/,"TL;DR: There's a Google spreadsheet linked below.  Please update it with a ""✔"" or a ""✘"" for whether or not the skill gem and support gem are compatible with each other.  *Please test all combinations before posting.  Please avoid assuming certain combinations work (I know, some are obvious, but some (as we've already found out) really aren't).*

.:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:.

Hey guys, a few days ago someone mentioned [this page](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Support_Gem_Compatibility) and how it's completely empty.  I'm willing to work on it (I've already added the first check mark, Bear Traps work with Added Cold Damage) but due to my [lack of certain gems](http://i.imgur.com/mL533fs.png) I am unable to complete this myself.

This is where you guys come in.  Either:

* 1.) Post here some compatible/incompatible combinations.
* 2.) Trade me some of the gems I'm missing so I may test it myself.
* 3.) ~~Tune into the stream to watch me test them.~~ I ran out of gems to test.

Obviously, I won't deny it, **getting free gems is my main motivating factor (and would be GREATLY APPRECIATED)** for completing this table but I do want to see this chart complete.  Also, I'm not sure if it's allowed but I'll try and post all the names of those who contribute gems/post combinations in the wiki (or try to at least, PM me if I forgot!).  Keep in mind my character is level 52, so I may not be able to equip leveled gems.

Wiki Page: http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Support_Gem_Compatibility

.:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:.

**Google Docs Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ak3nlxuLpzq0dDNJeTB0djI3SEZadnlram9yVkt1NFE&amp;usp=sharing**

***PLEASE DO NOT EDIT WITH ASSUMPTIONS.*  Test all your combinations before adding a ""✔"" or a ""✘.""**  This will save us time when we go back and check everything.  Leave editing the wiki page to me for now, since I'll be drawing all the information from the Google Doc.

They are compatible (99% certain) if the skill thumbnail has a letter on it indicating a support gem is linked to it and if the tooltip updates to show the added support gem's attributes.

.:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:.

My stream: http://www.twitch.tv/aeon_angel/new

List of Missing Gems: http://txtup.co/AECxe

Character: ""Senjougahara_Hitagi"" on Hardcore Mode (American Server)

.:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~:.

Edit 1: I've tested with all the gems that I currently own and the wiki page is updated to show this.  Until I find more gems or you guys contribute I won't be able to update any more of it.  While a better way to organize all this would be beneficial, even once we rework it we still need the data.

The problem is that support gems can't be mapped to which skill gems are compatible/incompatible by that skill gem's categories (examples are categories like ""Spell"" or ""AoE"").  For example, Item Quantity does not work on Decoy Totem, which is a spell as well as a totem, yet works on Spell Totem, which is also a spell and a totem.  It matters if the skill does damage or not.

So, unless we recategorize all the skills, our best bet at organizing which ones work with which is to list every gem and subsequently every gem that works with it, which can be pretty long.  But on a wiki page there will be links so you can skip forward to whichever gem you want to view.

Edit 2: Can someone test Conversion Trap + support gem to see if the support gem affects the turned mob?  I know with Summon Skeleton or similar skills gems like Added Cold Damage do apply to the minions.  But, they keyword is ""minion.""  I'm not sure if a monster that doesn't actually belong to you will have the gem's effect.  Especially since they aren't turned forever.  Furthermore, the wiki page states that ""minion-specific support gems"" don't affect it but would other gems?

Edit 3: I've added what will shape up towards being the final form of the page underneath the chart.  Please take a look at how it's formatted and add criticism as to how I could better format it.

Edit 4: **Added a Google doc spreadsheet.**  This will make things much, MUCH easier to edit.  Once we get this spreadsheet filled out we can finish the final wiki page which will be in a cascading list format.

***PLEASE DO NOT EDIT WITH ASSUMPTIONS.*  Test all your combinations before adding a ""✔"" or a ""✘.""**  This will save us time when we go back and check everything.  Leave editing the wiki page to me for now, since I'll be drawing all the information from the Google Doc.

Edit 5: Whoever color coded and formatted the spreadsheet to look all pretty, *let me love you.*

Edit 6: **GUYS, I RAN OUT OF GEMS A WHILE BACK.  Ya'll gotta help me, man.  I can't do this without you.  :'3**

Edit 7: Google Docs has revision history.  Griefing the table won't work since I can just rollback changes to whatever revision I want.  *Nice try though.*

PS: You're not funny.

If an Auction House system was in place, the market would be so flooded by rares that everyone could buy them for super cheap as soon as they get to a new level - and rare drops would be meaningless (or at best worth a very small amount of money or something non-exciting). If they were to balance a system to make that not happen, rares would have to be almost non-existent as drops in order to not flood the market and thereby making rares so ""rare"" that they wouldn't even be fun to aim for.

Instead, they have a system where rares drop fairly often (though are rarely useful) and all the extra rares tend to just be vendored or shared with friends. This allows the excitement of a new rare to still MEAN something. 

That rush in a group to grab your rare is a great moment, because it shows you it MIGHT be a rare you need. That moment when you see a rare drop off a boss or named mob is a fantastic moment of satisfaction. 

Keeping that rush in place, allowing it to happen fairly often but not too often, and having it mean something because there isn't a marketplace flooded with cheap rares is an incredible incentive to keep playing.

A solution: let physical crits reduce enemy damage output and movement speed. Perhaps stack 3x like lightning. This would be perfect for both armor and evasion types. Armor: kicks things down the mitigation curve, therefore mitigating even more. Evasion: less damage if you do get hit, slower enemies makes it easier to dodge with your mouse.

A simple solution that might bring some balance to the physical side of the game. The trick would be to get the numbers right.

EDIT: Some of the feedback here has been fairly constructive. Let me offer a few alternatives that might address some issues.

Different weapon types could very easily inflict different sorts of status effects. Hammers could inflict area of effect stun (duration based on size of physical damage), daggers could cripple, slow, and poison, swords could... do... something, etc. This would allow a diversity of effects that cater to different playing styles. For people who have chosen Resolute Technique, we might institute Shocking Blows-type chance-on-hit effects.

Less than a week ago, rates were pretty much consistent since the start of OB. Exalts = 5gcp = 15chaos = 30 alcs/scouring = 32-34 fusings

Now prices are absolutely skyrocketing. Exalts are being bought/sold for 7gcp, or 20-24 chaos, and I've even seen 46 fusings for 1 Exalt. GCPs seem to go for 4 chaos now, rather than 3. 

Prices on [ExileEX](http://www.exileex.com) are reminiscent of the ""old"" conversion rates, meanwhile [PoeEX](http://www.poex.info), which most users are using (outside of reddit), are showing these crazy exchange rates for high level orbs.

I can't think of a good reason why these prices are getting so high in the last week, after being stable for *months* since the start of OB. There are three possibilities I've come up with, though.

Either we have reached a critical mass of high level players who are using high level orbs (GCPs, Divines and Exalts) faster than the game can supply them, as when players get to a high enough level they use them (taking them out of the game) while we don't have many more people playing than before, so we have an overall shortage of these high level crafting orbs. Plus, people get desperate and impatient and want their orbs asap so they start over paying.

Or, there is simply an over inflation of low level orbs (Chaos and below) because they have much higher drop rates, and people tend not to use them as often relative to their drop rate (compared to high level orbs), and so rather than high value orbs increasing in value, low level orbs are actually decreasing in value. This doesn't explain why there is such a sudden change without cause.

Thirdly, and this is where I put on my tin foil hat, I could blame PoeEX. It is the most popular site currency exchange site, and given how recently the site [changed ownership](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1a7b74/i_sold_poeexinfo_to_someone_else_heres_why/), I have an alternative theory. The employees at the Real Money Trading (RMT) website that now own PoeEX have been buying up high level currency in the hundreds, and now have slowly been building up the exchange ratios in favor of their high level currency so they can make a decent profit off of gaming the exchange ratios. When you compare PoeEX to ExileEX, you see that ExileEX is slowly catching up (through voting, most likely because people are being influenced by PoeEX) but is still reminiscent of the rates before this massive change recently.

**Issues With Current Rule:** Difficult to enforce with exceptions, sometimes quality posts are removed because of the way they are posted. If we get to an image post late a lot of discussion might already be going on in the comments.

**Couter Argument:** All submissions should simply be made as self-posts in the first place. Anything that is not can just be removed and asked to be reposted as text only.

**Potential Changes or courses of action:**

- Leave the rule as is, continue removing most image posts and have mods make judgement calls on the others.
- Change the rule to a flat ""No direct linking of images, post as self post"", enforce to the letter.
- Remove the rule and replace it with ""No Memes, Image Macros, Loot Drops, or *Funny Pics*.""

Hello Diamond Supporters!  

First I’d like to make a correction to something I said last week. I attributed Pillar of the Caged God to the wrong supporter, it was made by QixunZ26.

**0.10.7**

0.10.7 was released on Friday last week. It contained four unique items, two made by Diamond Supporters.

Acton’s Nightmare is a unique map was made by IronCageSkirt. It is an item with a very top down design. By top down design, I mean the story and theme is the starting point for the design. All the mechanical elements are developed to support these creative ideas, rather than having the story/theme elements being changed to support mechanical elements.

As Acton’s Nightmare is based on a being in a music box, Andrew, our in house sound engineer, wrote and recorded the music box music used in this map.

Both top down and bottom up design can work well. We have items made from lore or idea first, and mechanics made to fit, and ones which are designed to fill a specific mechanical niche first and the art and flavour text built later. It is not always easy to work out which is which when looking through the unique item list. I think the variedness of the items benefit from multiple ways of making them.

Thief’s Torment was designed by Davros70. Davros70 wanted the item be be based on a base type that did not exist in the game, an all resists ring. After some discussion, we decided this did fill a good space in the game, so the Prismatic Ring was added to the game.

We had intended to put Davros70’s ring in shortly after Open Beta, but the next delay was getting the mod to allow only one ring to be worn. This had a few complications. It is quite a bit more complicated than the existing item which disabled a slot, as (1) we already have the tech for disabling the second weapon slot, and (2) the ring can be placed in either of two slots, and needs to disable the other. This led to the issue not finding enough time in the schedule to have attention devoted to it and it ended up with a few delays.

**0.10.8**

We have our production schedule for unique items a little askew at the moment. While we have been getting unique items in, there has been a lot of focus on getting them finished and out the door, and a not enough focus on getting the design process for new ones underway.

I have a pile of information sent through from supporters to make sure our unique pipeline is restored and underway. Luckily we now also have Rory working hard on unique items as well. We do have Mark having a well deserved holiday very soon. As our primary programmer for the special mods we need for unique items, this will also have an impact on our schedule. We hope to have a good pipeline sorted out this week, and you won’t notice any drop in unique items coming out!

0.10.8 should include an Amulet from Tertium_Quid, and we should have more worked out soon!

**Insider Info**

This week, as I’ve already mentioned Andrew above as doing the music for the Acton’s Nightmare map, I thought I’d profile Andrew Reid.

Andrew started at GGG at the very beginning of 2012 as our resident audio engineer and sound designer.

Andrew very quickly proved his worth, and basically took over the whole process from very beginning to very end, and has done everything from voice work to mastering the soundtrack, and has had a hand in pretty much every sound you hear in the game. His job is to create and mix all the audio that goes into the game. This involves making ambient sound for the game levels, sound effects for monsters and skills, working with voice acted dialogue and now even occasionally writing music.

Before GGG Andrew worked as a full time DJ until starting a job for IOS audiobook developer Booktrack. This is his first job in the gaming industry. Andrew studied at SAE for a diploma in audio engineering.

Hello Diamond Supporters!  

It has been a huge week! 0.10.5 was released last Monday, and 0.10.6 was released on Friday.

**0.10.5**

0.10.5 was delayed, but a large patch, and it included three new support gems.

It also included two diamond unique items, Pillar of the Caged God from Jarchan, and Darkray Vectors from Sleekray.

Darkray Vectors has a couple of interesting elements that are worth mentioning as they affect those of you with uniques with potentially very powerful, but not straight forward elements.

In out internal balance testing, Darkray Vectors proved very strong. Sleekray was less certain we had the initial values right, and I promised him if it proves too weak we will adjust it. On release many felt it was a weak item. I do think we will see people take advantage of its powers. If we don’t see that in a few weeks, I’ll be making good on my promise to Sleekray and buffing the item.

Pillar of Caged God has also had its power level argued about, but I think it is more apparent that it has potential to be very dangerous.

The other two unique items in 0.10.5 were Tabula Rasa and Icetomb. Tabula Rasa has impinged on some design space that some people have asked for in their Diamond Unique items. We did feel it was worth putting in as designed (in this case Tabula Rasa is an Erik design, our Art Director). If you feel an item introduced covers a similar design space to what you wanted, let us know!

If you present an idea for an item, you can change it, you aren’t tied to what you first suggest.

**0.10.6**

0.10.6 was a smaller patch. Searing Bond was the skill introduced, it is different to many of our other skill designs. It introduces a different style of play, but because of how different it is, it doesn’t play well with our existing supports.

The diamond supporter unique items included in 0.10.6 were Soul Mantle from Durentis, The Coward’s Trial from OverUsedChewToy. The other unique items, from Brother Laz were Aurumvorax and Abyssus.

Both Soul Mantle and The Coward’s Trial took a lot of time to develop.

They both covered something we wanted to do internally, an item with +1 totems, with a different downside to Ancestral Bond, and a map with a different style of play. Both required a lot of testing and changes. The Coward’s Trial was also presented at the same time as another undead themed unique map with interesting elements.

For the Brother Laz items, I’d like to point out other GGG items not attributed to him also have his input. There is a lot of discussion (mostly with comments on our unique planning documents over a great deal of time). I suspect these discussions would look harsh and argumentative from the outside, but getting items right is important.

I mention this, as I noticed a diamond supporter mentioning to someone else on the forum that I “didn’t like” the items they suggested to us, based on my reply. As it happened, I did like the idea a great deal, but I wanted to mention the problems it would have, and what elements wouldn’t work. In our internal discussions for GGG items, this would normally lead to comments defending ideas, discussion of what we’d need to change, under what conditions we could do something like that.

If you get a comment back from us that sounds like a flat out no, or in a tone that seems overly harsh to you, please let us know, and don’t take it personally! We are used to tempering by fire in our creative process.

**0.10.7**

After all that discussion, there is the next patch to discuss! We haven’t exactly nailed down what is going into 0.10.7 as far as unique items go, as we have several items which are very close but missing one element or another. We may see a map from IronCageSkirt, an amulet from Tertium_Quid, a ring from Davros70. We also have several items that have been sitting almost ready for a while that need something that has proven a little harder than first imagined, including items from Devoware, NuclearRaven and Kohrock. We also have many more items which are close, or we are keen to get started on.

Rory and I are hoping to get back to many of you soon. Also feel free to contact either of us regarding your item.

**Insider Info**

This has been a long newsletter, and has discussed a lot of items. So you won’t get much effort spent on insider info today. Luckily the office has concept art just lying around, so I can show you some of that:

[link](http://i.imgur.com/rZzeWO3.jpg)

1. The economy. Items exiting the HC economy on character death fights inflation, changes what types of items are valued, and make the wealth that I amass over time seem more meaningful to me.

2. Tighter builds. HC forces you to take defenses, mobility, crowd control, etc. more seriously. I know some people think the need for hp and defense stacking in HC is excessive, but I'm a min-maxer at heart and I love to find efficient builds within the constraints imposed by the game. One of those constraints right now is that a huge hp pool is not optional, so for me, that means the goal is to make sure my hp stacking builds are better than your hp stacking builds. And if my build fails, I can start from scratch and test out a new variant in an attempt to make it even better. Iterative improvement is the path to wealth and glory!

3. Better players on average. I don't mean this to be a flame on Default players, and plenty of very skilled players choose to play Default because they enjoy it more, but overall, the pool of active HC players naturally self-selects for people who are reasonably good at the game, and interested in learning about its mechanics. People who don't fit that criterion tend not to enjoy HC, or at least not to progress very far. Anyone who is able to get to 'endgame' and stay there (or level a new character to get back to that level if their current main dies) has to have a pretty decent grasp on the game. Even less successful HC players end up thinking more about survivability, about what sorts of things tend to kill them and how they can avoid those deaths in the future. 

4. It feels like a Roguelike. I grew up playing this sort of game, and I love it. It's not that I love almost dying and knowing that I narrowly avoided losing my character; it's knowing that I will lose my characters. It's hard to explain to anyone who doesn't enjoy this sort of gameplay, but I really do like the fact that each character is but a temporary vessel through which I interact with Wraeclast. In a game that is really all about the loot at its core, I like the fact that my stashed loot is the real way to track my progress long-term, not my current roster of characters. Rule of Acquisition #102: Nature decays, but latinum lasts forever.

So, to me, it has nothing to do with being an adrenaline junkie who needs the possibility of loss so I can feel excited when I almost lose. My preference for HC is due to directly enjoying permadeath, as well as appreciating the indirect structural consequences that introducing permadeath has on the economy and on player builds and behaviors.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,hardcore,True,t3_1aixmq,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1aixmq/playing_on_hardcore_4_reasons_why_it_is_so_fun/,

Hello Diamond Supporters!

0.10.3 included three more diamond uniques, Maelstrom of Chaos (Skivverus), Starkonja’s Head (Shuvit82) and Matua Tapuna (Covert).

I’m enjoying watching the item hunt as it unfolds after each patch.

This newsletter will now also be sent out to those who have paid for the Design a Unique option in the microtransaction shop.

0.10.4

This week the 0.10.4 patch will be released onto Open Beta.

This week there will only be two Diamond unique items. There were three, but one had game breaking issues discovered during the last QA session before 0.10.4 was deployed to Alpha. It was a unique map that was pulled. We are currently aiming to have four Diamond Unique items in 0.10.5. The unique maps have proven to be more time consuming than originally planned, which has led to a delay getting unique flasks in, which may be a few weeks away now.

This week’s Diamond items come from Serein and TrueOmega.

Avatars

Over the last week around ten avatars were completed and are ready to be patched in this Wednesday. The art pipeline for these is well in gear.

Insider Info

This week I thought I’d give a small snippet of info from our lore document, which outlines all the information about the history of Wraeclast. This entry gives some information about the origins of maps:

Lazhwar - An old archbishop of the Eternal Faith who secretly conducted dark experiments, using thaumaturgy to create his own miniature worlds in which he could rule as a God. Malachai studied his work with interest, using Lazhwar’s designs as the foundation for his Eternal Laboratory. 

When the Emperor Voll took power, Malachai freely gave Lazhwar over to the Purity Courts. Lazhwar was burned at the stake for ‘fraternizing with unholy forces’.

Also of note, next week Chris, Erik and Jonathan will be at GDC in San Francisco.

* 3 magic flasks gives an unidentified flask of the next highest tier. ~~No Proof~~ [Confirmed,](http://i.imgur.com/aiSiS1k.png) (Note: Doesn't work with Hallowed flasks, simply gives 3x Wisdom fragments.)

* 3 Normal (white) flasks give a normal flask of the next highest tier. 


**Unconfirmed Recipes**

* Movement Speed Boots (rare or magic, not unique) + Augmentation orb + Quicksilver Flask = Magic boots of the same base type with the next highest tier MS. Example, you have blue velvet slippers with 15% MS. Vendor that with a QS and Augmentation, you'll end up with velvet slippers with 20% MS. (The only reason this is unconfirmed is because I haven't seen a screenshot / proved it myself)

The most recent set of unique items was deployed in 0.10.2. They have been discovered, and there has been much discussion about them on the site and elsewhere.

0.10.3

This week the 0.10.3 patch will be released onto Open Beta.

The new Cyclone skill is the main game change going into this patch. As well, there will be four new uniques. As last week, three of these will be from Diamond Supporters: Skivverus, Covert and Shuvit82.

One of these is a unique map. Originally a second unique map was planned, but was unfortunately delayed.

We are going to try maintain this 3+1 schedule of unique items, although it can be easy for something to be delayed (like one of the planned unique maps).

Avatars

Erik tells me that some avatars went out in the last patch and more are on the way.

Insider Info

This week I won’t be giving away anything upcoming, but will show off a couple of sources for things in the game.

In a fantasy RPG, you have to name many, many things. Naming can be a challenge, and almost anything becomes fair game. You may well have been killed by the local [laundromat](http://i.imgur.com/boXqo0G.jpg). The name was used for one of the unique bosses found in the prison.

AW:how about 1 chaos for Some Item?

Selling Dude: no way it's worth more

AW: okay, how much?

AW: didn't I already do that?  :(

Is this just the sort of community I need to expect for this game?

I don't really *want* to spend 5 minutes looking up the value of the item in question on forums and such before I try to buy it from some random dude in trade chat, but is that how it's going to be?  

For now I just give a low-ish offer which I think is safe enough and if I don't get a counter offer I just ignore the player, because TBH I don't want to waste my time reading his trade spam if he refuses to even price his items.

**Current Rule: No trade/giveaway posts. Use the subreddit dedicated to trading**

****

**Issues With Current Rule:** Various meta posts have been made suggesting the community is too divided.

**Couter Argument:** Trade posts and price checks can occur in large volumes, potentially drowning out other content.

****
****
**Potential Changes or courses of action:**

- Leave the rule as is, people making trade posts can be directed to relevant sub.
- Remove the rule and allow said posts in the sub - let the upvotes decide.
- Change rule to allow certain things but not others (suggestions?)

2) forces social interaction - I made a friend today in an online game for the first time in years and its just because I had to negotiate on the sell price of a molten shell gem

3) its a really rewarding mental exercise to try and figure out what something is worth and guess what others are willing to pay.  Market interfaces have basically taken this entire process out of our hands in most games (maybe a good thing for some people?)

Some details could be wrong, and some of the higher level rewards could still be inaccurate since not very many players make it that far.  I'll update this thread as I obtain new information.  In the meantime, there should be enough here to get through the next few races.


*  [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Aj3If4kWsfR6dHFhZUhxc09rc0V2cVowOVlOemxTWmc#gid=0) - Currently closed for editing, if you have any information to add or change, please note in the comments, preferably with a reference.

**Chests**:
In general, the curious chest contains items for defensive play, while the alluring one contains items more for speed. For more specific information and the differences between classes, refer to the spreadsheet.  Based on what I've seen, I'm inclined to believe that sockets are randomly generated when the gear in chests drops (other than starting gear) - I'd like a bit more information to confirm this.

* **Provisions:** Class Starting Weapon Set, small mana flask, 2x Gems, and 2x Wisdom Scrolls.

Level|Category|Curious Chest|Alluring Chest
:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:
1|Flasks|2x Medium Health Flasks, 2x Small flasks|2x Quicksilver, 2x Wisdom Scrolls
2|Gems|Class Specific Skill Gems|Class Specific Skill Gems
3|Gear|Mana Ring, HP Ring, Augment, Transmute| Weapon Set for your class, Augment, Transmute
4|Flasks/Orbs|2x Medium Mana Flasks, Coral Amulet, 2x Transmute, 3x Wisdom|2x Orb of Alchemy

8|Rings|2x HP Rings, Greater Life Flask, Large Life Flask, 2x Chaos, Alchemy|2x each resist ring, Large Mana Flask, 2x Transmute, Augment|
9|Gear| Full set of class appropriate gear (Helm, Chest, Gloves, Boots), 2x Alchemy, 3x Armourer, Leather Belt| Weapon Set, 2x Alchemy, 3x Whetstones, Rustic Sash (maybe not for Witch)|
10|Gems|Class Specific Gems|Class Specific Gems
11| Support Gems|Missing most information still|Missing most information still|



**Weapon Sets:**  These are the items that will drop from the alluring or curious weapon set chests.  I've extrapolated a bit from sparse information, so this might not be 100% correct. Note that these aren't the same as the sets in the starting chest. The item types are appropriate to the dungeon level.

 * Duelist: 2x 1h Swords, 1x 2h Sword.
 * Marauder: 1h Club, Shield, 2h Club
 * Templar: 1h Sceptre, Shield, 2h Staff
 * Witch: 2x Wands, 2h Staff.  (Its possible that some chests I haven't seen contain Wand/ES Shield instead of 2x wands)
 * Shadow: 2x Knives, ES/Eva Shield (Speculation: There could be claws later)
 * Ranger: Bow, Quiver

**Zones:**
Monster levels, mob types, and dungeon bosses can be found on the spreadsheet. I've listed where the difficulties change below.

* 1-6 are normal difficulty.  
* 7-12 (starting at the Frozen Abyss) are cruel difficulty.  That means negative resists and higher monster damage.  
* 13-15? (starting at the Desecrated Shrine) are merciless difficulty.  I was able to confirm the monster levels up through dungeon 11, and assuming this follows the same progression, The Desecrated Shrine should be level 25 and the final dungeon would be level 29.

**Tips:** 
(These are merely observations from watching too many Twitch VoDs, and everything here should be taken with a grain of salt. We'll know much better after a few races what the best strategies are)

* Duelists are OP.
* The same principles that apply to normal races generally apply here.  Area damage is prefered over single target, and you don't need to kill all the monsters.
* The Quicksilver Flasks chest should be considered a mandatory choice for any competitive run.  Also, Medium Life flasks have a higher droprate than Quicksilvers anyway.
* Some zones (e.g. the Statue zone) are unlikely to be worth clearing for most classes (i.e. not duelists). It seems to be better to more fully clear zones like the skeleton and monkey zones to catch up on levels.
* You don't have to kill the boss to proceed.  While the boss can drop nice gear, the amount of time required or danger incurred may not be worth it for some classes.
* The bosses for a few zones are after the reward chests.
* Once you've zoned into the next dungeon, you can't go back to the previous one.  Likewise, if you have to log out for any reason during the race, you will be returned to the beginning of your current dungeon.
* Your final level still counts for race rewards even if you die.  
* Transmute Large/Greater Life flasks for instant recovery (Seething/Bubbling). -credit: Shaoxy

 
**Sources:** I compiled most of this information through a combination of Twitch Vods and the two public indexes.  As of right now any information I was only able to find on the public index is followed by a (?) on the spreadsheet.

**Links:** For more information and various community lists, see these threads:

* [Path Of Exile General Forum Public Index](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/442549)
* [r/pathofexile Public Index](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1h8hwa/heres_a_spreadsheet_anyone_can_edit_duringafter/)

**Edit1:** Added links and improved formatting.


**Edit2:** Corrections since the first race:

 * Marauders Support Gems from Statues swapped to correct positions 
 * Templar Anger and Lightning Strike gems corrected as well.
 * Various cleanup work.
 * Please: if you used this and found anything incorrect, let me know so I can fix it before the next race.  Ultimately, I'd like the public forum thread to be the definitive source, but until its 100% verified, I'll keep maintaining this.

**Edit3:**

They also get to have a 6 link bow which also gives great stats.  

Two-handed swords are underpowered in comparison, from what I have seen they give the same amount of stats as the usual bow without the quiver. 

Now damage may be taking into consideration but from what I have experienced it seems that they both have the potential to deal roughly the same ammount of damage.  Although I would give the slight edge to bows.

Harbinger Bow 64.8 dps Thicket Bow 58.1 dps.
however, take into consideration the offensive rolls on quiver. 

Now attacking from range already has its upsides. Although lightning strike effectively could make twohanded swords a ranged attack. 

What it comes down to is those extra stats that a bow user gets and the twohanded sword user does not.  This seems inherently unfair.

I might do this weekly as I feel there are a lot of underused skills and supports in the game.  Alternatively you can submit your own skill and actually populate this subreddit with content.  The skills might not actually be changed, but the perceptions around them might.

Does laughable amounts of damage compared to the build up time needed to cast it.    
Loss of all charges of all types immediately.    
Undying grappler mobs use it, doing wildly unpredictable damage.    
Point blank AoE makes it worthless for practically every build past cruel, right when the character has developed enough to make it useful.    
Can't be linked to traps, mines or totems.

Pros:    
High spike damage.  Hits harder than anything else in the game when fully powered up.    
Can crit, potentially inflicting a fairly powerful ignite, freeze and shock in AoE.    
Removes charges?

From: Qarl

Hello Diamond Supporters!

0.10.4 included just two diamond uniques, Bloodseeker (Serein) and Alpha’s Howl (TrueOmega).

There was a lot of discussion on the forums about the strength of both these items. There are arguments on both sides of the overpowered/underpowered side for these items.

We’ll certainly be keeping our eye on these, and other uniques, to see how much they get worn, and how well they compete with other items in the same slot.

0.10.4B

As was announced, 0.10.5 and the supports it introduces will be delayed.

However we were still keen to patch in new uniques and cosmetic microtransactions.

0.10.4B will include 4 diamond supporter unique items, from Jarchan, IronCageSkirt, Carkasjak and Zinger86

One of these is a map (but still not the one that was delayed from a past patch, that still needs work).

Insider Info

For this weeks insider info, I thought I’d introduce one of the people who works on Path of Exile. Blake Dwan started in June 2012, so doesn’t currently appear on the Grinding Gear Games website staff photo.

Blake is an environmental 3d artist. He is a graduate of the Auckland Media Design School, and has worked previously on iPhone games.

Here he can be seen working on tiles for the garden area that will appear when the extension to Act 3 is released.

In the game currently, Blake’s work can be best seen impaled on spikes in the Lunaris Temple.

I’ll introduce other staff every so often in the insider info part of the newsletter.

Really good turnout I believe ~35ppl showed up. Including a Ruler of Wraeclast &amp; the creator of the Bringer of Rain. Both awesome blokes, the bringer of rain inspiration clearly shines in the item, arguably the best unique in the game from a item design point of view. 

Things we learned:

- By deductive reasoning the 3x boss was figured out. And its going to be EPIC

- Magic the gathering inspiration for the 4 month leagues, diff uniques to float in and out. 

- A massive change is being pushed to move some nodes in the marauder tree out to places that make more sense. 

- The new unique 1 handed axe got hit with a 25% nerf just prior to being released in its current state. Yes its still insane!

- Want to revamp a unique server wide.....12 hour realm downtime. 

- Chris loves seeing Kripp die. 

- Searing bond more than map viable, we (players) just havnt figured out how to make it work yet

- Qarl is a living legend and all balance rage must be directed at him. 

- Melee not viable you say....talk to Qarl. (HINT: YOU'RE WRONG!)

- Stalkers love Chris.

- Work on Act 4 starting. 

- Act 5??? 

- Chris has a love child idea that is amazing. Not priority now tho unfortunately. 

- The secret recipe that only one person has discovered was not meant to be in the game, mistakenly added into the game code. Its here to stay. 

- Melbourne is freaking cold.

- Melbourne public transport sucks

- Secret pet is received once you meet Chris in person.

EDIT: Almost forgot - Softcore, anarchy, hardcore, Onslaught distribution - 9,9,3,1

- Chris's wife has the best set of sneakers for night time.

I’ll discuss the development of this race type later in the newsletter when we do a profile on Mark “Neonspyder” Roberts.

At the end of the week there is also the New Zealand Game Developers Association conference. ( http://www.nzgda.com/news/nz-gdc-2013-programme-announced/ )

Most of our developers are attending, and there will be talks from three of the Grinding Gear Games founders (Chris Wilson, Jonathan Rogers and Erik Olofsson)

After that, I’ll be off on a short holiday, as I’ll be going to a traditional game design meetup/playtesting event organised by Martin Wallace, one of my favourite boardgame designers. I am excited to go to this event, as before working at Grinding Gear Games, I designed boardgames ( for example Endeavor - http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/33160/endeavor ). As the event is in the Coromandel, my family and I were going to have a few days exploring this part of New Zealand.

- a refactor of our damage stats systems, which should allow us to do more things with damage and resolve a few issues we have had up until now.

- new art and names for helmets

- support for Descent, the new race type that is a signature race of Season Three.

As well as those features, 0.11.1 will be including at least four new uniques created by supporters.

There is an Occultist Vestment from Nuclear_Raven that has been almost ready for several months, but required the stats refactor for one of the mods. It also required some last minute changes as the game has changed a lot since the item was initially created.

AriesEMP brings us the first of our unique flasks. There are more to come!

We have a knowledged themed Paua ring coming from iamaCyborg, who was the founder of the Path of Exile wiki.

We are also trying to get two high level spike items completed, an Imperial Bow from Chocotacos, and a Terror Maul from KingKongor. It can be challenging to get the balance right for this kind of item, both so it is strong enough, and that it doesn’t become too dominant in play.   
   
**Insider Info**
   
Mark “Neonspyder” Roberts initially started off as a player of Path of Exile. He was based in Auckland, and had been recommended for a QA position to us. When we needed (and could afford) a new QA person, we asked Mark.

Mark (or Mark2 as he is internally known) turned out to be very useful, good at QA, excellent as a balance tester with his knowledge for high level play. It was interesting watch him do more than full days of work at the office, and then still maintain a top 20 position in the one month race.

Mark came to GGG with a good knowledge of games, and had extensive theorycrafting and balance analysis from several games. For example, Mark had over 40 pages on Rift builds built up from before he started playing Path of Exile. Mark has a Computer Science degree from University of Auckland, and describes his study as “getting his degree and playing MMORPGs”.

As well as doing QA and balance testing, Mark has started doing more game design. He was heavily involved in organising the last half of race Season Two. He has gone most of the planning for Season Three. For the new race type, Descent, Mark has used his game and race knowledge to plan the chests for the Descent.

Near the end of each Descent level, there are a pair of chests. Their contents are chosen for each class, and a player can only pick one. Once one is chosen, the other is destroyed.

Mark developed the contents of the chests to provide interesting and challenging choices. They will provide remedial and interesting options for new players, while providing an interesting set of choices across an entire race for experienced players. This was a pure game design task, and Mark has been testing and iterating the on the chest contents for much of the last week.

I am really looking forward to how players tackle the Descent races. I am especially interested to see how the strategies develop as players play through this race type throughout the season.

**Hello Diamond Supporters!**  

It has been three months since Open Beta has started. In the very first Month I received many emails from new Diamond Supporters. I am currently making sure I have all the emails recorded, and a plan in place to contact and get underway with unique design. If you haven’t heard from Rory or myself, you should soon. Feel free to contact us yourself if you are wondering why you haven’t had a reply yet.

**0.10.7b**

Today, 0.10.7b has been deployed.

We were only able to squeeze one Diamond item in this patch, an Amulet from Tertium Quid. The other item had a few issues with its unique mods and had to be delayed. This isn’t that strange. If an item does something new or unusual in the game, it needs to be tested as thoroughly as any other system. It needs to be tested in all circumstances and any issues need to be resolved.

One thing I thought I would discuss about unique items is the 2D art. At the moment, most of the 2D icon art for unique items is made by Filippo Valsecchi, our in-house concept artist. The workflow depends on what is being made, but it can start with both the classic pencil and paper, or using a 3D sculpt in zbrush. Either way, the last step is photoshop, where colour and texture are finalised. To be efficient, larger versions of the Icon art are also used as concept art for when the item gets modelled. The high resolution versions can also be used as promotional material, like the large art on the race reward page on our website.

To give you an idea of the quality and size of art that is first produced, here is a full size image of the Amulet in the 0.10.7B patch. This was a 17MB tiff file (2048 by 2048 pixels). This turns into the much smaller icon (78 by 78 pixels) used in game.

**0.10.8**

0.10.8 will include a Unique Ring from TakenNotGranted, and also being worked on are items from MonopolyLegend, Kohrock, Zahndethus and several others.

Looks like I forgot to post Wiki Wednesday yesterday, so here I am to put it up now.

[Link to last week's thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1apbj4/wiki_wednesday_2/)

Wiki Wednesday is the weekly event where we remind everyone that a good wiki will help Path of Exile attract and retain more players, and help the whole community thrive. If we, the players, don't contribute to the wiki, who will?

Last week, we talked about the [Character Class Pages](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Character_Classes). This time around, I'd like to draw attention to [Skills and Gems](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Skills). As new skills are added to the game, players are going to be looking to the skills page to learn about the gem's requirements, damage output, interactions with supports, and other details. We need to make sure that info is added as quickly as possible while still being accurate and maintaining good formatting.

But it's not just new skills that need work! A lot of skill gem pages either have missing information ([Incinerate](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Incinerate)) or may have incorrect information (such as [Culling Strike](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Culling_Strike) and [Item Rarity](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Item_Rarity) where the XP table appears to be wrong or out of order). I also suspect that some gem pages may not have been updated to reflect patch changes where skill requirements or damage have changed.

We need **YOU** to do your part! Take a look at the skills you use and compare their stats to what's shown on the skill gem pages. Found an interesting or unusual skill interaction, or a support gem that doesn't work or works in an unexpected way? Make sure that info is on the wiki for other players to learn from!

As the title says, **when I press SHIFT, I want my character to stop if it is already moving.** (They way it currently is it just prevents new movement, and many unnecessary clicks are needed for correct positioning.)

2. **Auto-acquire targets on most melee skills if in range.** I like playing assassin-esque, melee characters (claw ranger), but I abhor constant clicking. They way I like to play them is to put my favorite melee skill on the right mouse button, and just keep running through the map holding the button down, while my char slices and dices everything in range. Currently, most melee skills feel unresponsive, randomly moving or attacking in place when no enemies are near. This should work with aoe attacks like cleave too - it should just start attacking once an enemy is in range.

3. **Limited time leagues** - instead or in addition to races. One and three hour and other races are a great idea, but committing that time in one big chunk is a no-no for me. When starting a new char, I would like to be able to choose, say, a one hour league, meaning that my HC character would live for exactly one hour gametime before being moved into three hour league, and after that, one day league, perhaps one week - and then moved into the permanent HC league if it didn't die. Sorry if this was suggested before. (Of course, this would need a new reward/laddering scheme, perhaps just integrating it with the default HC league, and notifying the player of rewards, ladder status and other achievements at these intervals.)

The issue, in my opinion, is basically the fact that everyone has access to everything. Primarily Auras. When you have a set group that you're almost guaranteed to be playing with, there's some variation in who will use what Aura, but to a certain extent every build has to take advantage of using as many Auras as it can, because they are all incredibly powerful and incredibly easy to stack by abusing certain mechanics.

In addition, unless you're focusing heavily on Energy Shield, Health nodes are required for almost every build. Practically 1/4 - 1/2 of all of your skill points will be spent on Health nodes if you plan on pushing the end game.

 To me, every build feels like 95% the same and the only difference is what attack you end up using. The only difference between a Freeze Pulser and EKer is that one does Cold damage and the other physical. This makes rolling new characters rather dull.

As deep as this game appears, I just can't get into it. There are two things that Path of Exile does extremely well: The barter-based economy and the end game map system. Honestly, if D3 had those it would be a better game, imo, as the economy and endgame are where it failed hard.

Shadow seems ideal for this but I'm open to any other suggestions.  I will share the strategies I've come up with so far and hopefully you all have some ideas for me as well!

1.) Highest possible move speed.  This is the bread and butter of my build.  I'm making sure to grab all the movement speed nodes on the passive tree (except for one 2%er in marauder) because obviously getting to the loot faster than anyone else is important.  Moving faster allows you to rush ahead of your team and open all the chests and clear all the trash and jack all the loots.

2.) Frost wall.  It doesnt do much until you get high cast speed, the 3 skill duration nodes, and an increased duration support gem.  But once you do this can be an effective way to block your allies in tight spaces while the loot timers run out.  Takes some practice, and you will get kicked if you use it too much.  Save it for those chaos orbs / uniques etc.

3.) Big AoE dps for trash clearing.   Rushing ahead of your team only gives you a few seconds to work with before they catch up.  Killing bosses isnt realistic, but clearing all the trash can definately be a worthwhile endeavor.  Your team wont even know you are jacking them a lot of the time because they arent on screen to see the loots with their names on it.

4.) Knockback.  You want to push the mobs in to an ideal space for frost wall to be usable.  Also good just to push the mobs off the screen of your allies as they are about to die so they dont even see that they have looting to do.

5.) Tankiness.  Once you have met the other criteria, its important to be as tanky as possible so that you can charge in to almost any situation to grab that loot.

So thats what I've come up with so far.  Please help me refine my build!  What have I missed

btw as far as I know minions do not block movement or else I would have them in the build as well.

EDIT1: Forgot to include lightning warp / leap slam, but these are crucial skills for some maps.  I am partial to lightning warp since my build has so much move speed.  Leap slamming a short distance seems to take a good deal longer than lightning warp.  Some good feedback tho, I am reading it all! Thanks and keep it coming!!

EDIT2: My first prototype for this build was poison arrow ranger.  The strength of the ranger is how close they start to the Celerity node (8% move speed) and the 3 increased duration nodes.  The main problem I had was finding enough int to keep leveling up frost wall.  Also, while increased duration might work great for poison arrow on a regular character, it just doesn't clear trash fast enough for a ninja spec.  I found myself wanting more AoE burst to drop them quickly and get those loot timers ticking down before allies could make it on screen.  As many ppl have mentioned poison arrow is good for creating lag for your allies, so I will keep it in my shadow spec for that purpose.  Made it up to mid 30s with the ranger this last weekend.  I jacked tons of good loot (no uniques yet!!!) even with this unoptimized spec, and almost never had any of my loot taken.  I try to be sneaky with my shenanigans and so I only got kicked once, and even then the leader wasn't sure who the ninja was and kicked multiple people just to be rid of me.  It definately helps to be polite in team chat to keep the attention off of you.  Make sure its you that drops the tp's for newcomers, and be as friendly as possible.  I probably won't get too involved with tracking my loot income but on a subjective level it felt like a lot more loot was coming in than with standard play.  The shadow build looks to be much stronger and I'm gonna focus on getting him up to speed this week/weekend.  

EDIT3: A witch and I ended up partying for most of last night with a full party of various randoms that would come and go.  She was also playing competitively for loot and at such low levels (not many movespeed nodes, not tanky enough, no frost wall) I didnt have any of the tools I need to get an edge on other competitive looters.  But even still SHE DIED (in hardcore)!!! So hilarious...it was right at the end of the A2 dungeon where you get the baleful gem.  We had been trying to out ninja eachother for hours, and so as the lightning boss (forget the name) was getting low on hp she positioned right next to it to be as close as possible to the soon-to-drop loot.

Greetings, Exiles, and welcome to another edition of **Wiki Wednesday**!

This is a friendly weekly reminder that the unofficial PoE wiki (http://pathofexilewiki.com) is a critical part of the community, and we should all do our part to make it the best resource possible. Each week, we'll focus on updating a specific page or subset of the wiki, as well as discuss changes and additions we'd like to see.

Last week we focused on the [**Quest Rewards**](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Quest_Rewards) page, and while there was a lot of enthusiastic discussion, I didn't see a lot of actual edits to the quest rewards or individual quest pages. Let's keep in mind that the quest pages and quest rewards are going to continue to need ongoing attention as new skill gems are added to the game. I do want to give a shout out to a user named **Kuryux** on the wiki, who got the new Arctic Armor skill added to the quest rewards page quite promptly. Thanks, Kuryux!

This week, I'd like to draw your attention to the **Class Pages**.

* [Witch](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Witch)
* [Shadow](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Shadow)
* [Ranger](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Ranger)
* [Duelist](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Duelist)
* [Marauder](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Marauder)
* [Templar](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Templar)

Currently, they all have a basic description of the class (pulled from the official PoE website, I think?) and a list of the class's base stats. Some of them have some or all of the class's voiced lines (such as what they say when beating certain bosses or reaching certain levels), but others are missing the transcription completely, so it would be nice to try to get ALL the voiced lines transcribed.

I'm not sure what else might be good to add to these pages, but ideas are welcome! I do think it's been decided, though, that **build recommendations should not go directly on the class pages**. Instead, links to external sites or discussion pages are more appropriate. It would also be nice if people would clean up any typos, error, or formatting inconsistencies they come across.

As always, suggestions for improving this weekly event and what areas of the wiki to focus on next are greatly appreciated!

I've always enjoyed watching kripp's videos on youtube although I have no idea what he's talking about after he switched and started playing POE. Though the game looks fun, I didn't touch it again after trying out and letting US gateway lagged my brains out, until now, just found out that GGG rolled out AUS server and I've been enjoying the game quite alot :D


Personally i'm mainly a solo player, so my biggest question is, how do i get gems? Can't play or try out a build without skills in a game :/


**Questions:**


*Build and leveling:

- How do i check others' build, skill gems, and items, or Can I? (is there a website like d3 or wow)

- I'm trying out templar discharge build and just got my discharge gem from a quest reward, but the damage is lower or rather less efficient than fire trap that i've been using (and i'm running out of dex to level the gem further), what can i do in this leveling situation?

- Any good, up to date guides for endurance discharge templar out there?

- I've got my 2nd enduring cry gem after leveling another character and getting it as quest reward, do i get another 1 or is there a way to shorten the 4s cooldown? (much like the previous point, killing speed and damage too slow and low)

- Leveling curve, I've just arrived on cruel and am dying quite abit, do i grind on lower levels and miss out on higher level drops?

- What's the level equivalent to end of inferno diablo mp0? (the level before 'farming end game content' begins)

- What are maps? end game content?

- How does drops work in POE? Is it phased, like in D3 or click fest like D2? (for multiplayer)


*Stats:

- What is energy armor? Is it total absorption or is damage still going to go through to hp after getting hit?

- What is the element 'Chaos'?

- Are there any penalties for resists on higher difficulties?

- How does armor work? Is it only for physical damage?

- Can i put 2 of the same support gem to link with a skill gem? for instance 2 chance to ignite with discharge.

- Are there any sites or resources that explains the massive passive tree bonuses like, extra burning dmg(does it include fire damage as a whole or just ignite damage?


*Currency:

- Do i use them while leveling?

- Where can i get information on the exchange rates?


*Trading:

- Can i survive without trading? (solo play mostly)

- How does the shops and trading forum work?

- Any sites or information on the shorthand writing of currencies?(like faq, what does CO mean)



I'm sorry for the noob questions as i'm still wrapping my head around the system and how the game works, the passive tree is so big (is it larger than ff-x's? lol) my head is hurting and the build guides and wikis on the web are lacking on basic infos for newbies like me(like playstyles for that build).

I know I'm kinda lazy to say this, but I'm trying to avoid the 'your build's gonna fail on your first try' on my first try and try to get to the end game for some farming fun, which i enjoy the most for my ARPG experience.

Btw, is the game bot infested atm or are there alot of multiboxing going on, i'm seeing asdbasibd1,2,3,4 on portals alot @.@

Lunaris, docks, fellshrine, and ledge runs in particular are plagued by this problem. If I'm farming these maps I want 6 active people at all times to maximize loot per hour.

Usually the first run goes fine because the party is still on the noticeboard so if one person leaves another can fill his spot but after that, usually one person leaves or stays in town too long, and then you're down to 5 people. One of the people notices and then you hover at 4 for a bit. Because the party is no longer on the noticeboard you have to completely remake the party every 30 minutes to an hour to have 6 total people farming the instance.

This is very cumbersome and annoying. If the party is actively doing runs and playing the game the party shouldn't disappear from the list. Then I'll join another party right as their noticeboard timer is about to run out and then they have to remake shortly after.

Thanks everyone for their feedback in the various threads we made a couple of days ago. Of course there were plenty of varied opinions on each topic but, as I was hoping, the reddit voting system along with the number of comments made at least an immediate course of action clear. Below are the outcomes of each individual post.

****
****

[THE NO IMAGE POSTS RULE](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1d8zvx/modpost_have_your_say_no_image_posts_rule/)

There were two fairly popular themes to how this should be dealt with:

- Replace the rule with ""No Memes, Image Macros, Loot Drops or Funny Pics""

- Self Posts Only, strictly enforced.

Overall, more people seemed to prefer the less severe, first option. This is good as it means we can go with that for now, trial it and re-evaluate it and decide if we need to go to self posts only in the future. If popular opinion changes in the future and the general consensus becomes that non *""No Memes, Image Macros, Loot Drops or Funny Pics""* image posts are ruining the sub we can make some more changes.

****
****

[THE NO TRADE, GIVEAWAY, PC THREADS RULE](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1d903l/modpost_have_your_say_no_tradegiveaway_posts_use/)

Thankfully one particular theme was by far the most popular for this one, which is good because I was quite unsure of if we should even modify this rule. It was:

- Giveaways are fine, Weekly or Bi-Weekly PC Threads, no trade posts

As such we will be changing the rule to say simple ""No Trading Posts"". 

PRICE CHECKS will be limited to the 1-2 weekly consolidated PC threads. It seem agreeed upon that these threads can provoke interesting discussion that can be learned from.

GIVEAWAY posts, for now, are allowed. But please don't abuse this and **delete your giveaway post once the majority of your things are given away**. You'll get spammed less in game if you do so anyway. For readers: if giveaway posts are low effort and low quality please just downvote them. If the OP takes the time to arrange everything, contact people and interact in the comments then throw it some upvotes!

****
****

[TAGGING POSTS](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1d90f2/modpost_have_your_say_tagging_posts/)

The general consensus was:

- Should be optional and not enforced

For now we'll be sticking with voluntary, in-title tages using the [Tag] format. In the future we may be able to implement some CSS that takes advantage of this or, alternatively, uses the flair system. We'll see how this basic method goes first though. I'll update the sidebar with some suggested tags but if no tag suits your post feel free to use your own, within reason.

Seems like the community would LOVE to see this taken to a MUCH larger scale!

So, that being said... I present to you the final quest to end all item finding quests.

The UBERGODMOAD 200 Run quest. 

I am going to pool the data of 200 runs of docks/ledge

I am also going to run 25 Lvl 66 maps - Only mod will be 4x Chisel to keep the variable consistant. Will only be running the DUNES map. (this is going to be hard, as the approx cost of these maps is going to run me around 4 exalt, which I currently do not have. I will accept donations with humble gratitude... for science)

I will be running each run with 225 IIR / 75 IIQ - This seems to be the cap where they start to hit DR. This will also afford me some more DPS and resists to allow the maps to be cleared without looking like a scrubcore baddie. I can calculate just how fast each run is quite easily using this method.

The rules::::::::::::::

Docks and Ledge:

~Each run will 100% explore the map (entrance not required as there are no mob spawns)
~Each run will 100% clear all the magic and rare monsters found, as well as Kuduku (Numbers will be totaled)
~All Rares will be left on the ground, and then collected after the run to prevent delay's 
~Any uniques will be picked up instantly in case of crashes

MAP Rules:

Maps will be cleared of EVERY mob - Only the total Blue/Yellow mobs will be counted + 1 for each map run (The boss...)


If there is enough interest, I will try and stream this, but I play on a ~2 year old gaming laptop and I am unsure as to the quality of the stream. 


I will be starting this in about 2 or so hours, depending on sleep needs after work and wether or not I can farm without passing out. Let me know if I forgot anything in this, I will be happy to bend the rules a little if the community wants to see more of this.

Keep it grinding!

This week we have our Executive Producer, Brian Weissman in the office. Brian is one of the founders of Grinding Gear Games (along with Chris, Jonathan and Erik). Aside from his initial investment, Brian provides a lot of direction to the game design, as well as writing.

You can see his work most directly in the flavour text of unique items and Keystones, as well as in the names of mods, monsters and base items. Naming may seem straightforward, but it is one of the harder writing jobs. Brian also wrote all of the monster lore and backstory that appeared on the old website. He worked extensively with Erik to formulate a lot of early plot elements, before Edwin McRae joined the company.

Brian Weissman is also well known as a Magic the Gathering player, the author of one of the earliest and best known Control Decks. His last visit to the studio was way back in late 2009. Brian comments “So much has changed since then!” You can see Brian here:

http://i.imgur.com/GblSvc8.jpg

**0.10.8c**

0.10.8c was deployed with just one unique, the helmet Bringer of Rain.

This item was designed by Prpnnightmare, and was inspired by gladiatorial combat and the Spartacus TV series. The art for the item was one of the last things Filippo Valsecchi did for us. This was especially appropriate as Filippo also did concept art for the Spartacus series.

**0.11.0**

This is a big patch for us. It will include a number of special unique items. None of these are from diamond supporters. This is unfortunate, but much of Rory’s time was devoted to the special unique items for special base type items coming in 0.11.0.

Insider Info

This week’s insider info shows a little more of the new areas of Act 3 which will appear at release:

While fighting him I had one of the most adrenalinating boss fights I've had in awhile. Every dodge, every move he made, had me terrified of dying. I didn't want to lose this character, not after how many hours of work I've put into him and his items.

When the Oversoul died and I had looted him, I realized why people love hardcore so much. It beckons back to the older days of gaming, where every action has a consequence. When I first played through POE on my Shadow, I would just throw up a portal and die 50 times fighting something (Vaal Oversoul for instance, when I farmed him I must've died like 5-6 times per attempt). I didn't really care.

But damn that adrenaline rush brought back some feelings from older games and the rush of good fights that I missed so much. Its a completely different game when you're at risk of losing dozens of hours of work.

Thank you GGG.

* Step 1: Find ""production_Config.ini"". It should be in your
    C:\Users\YourName\Documents\My Games\Path of Exile
folder, otherwise just search for it.

* Step 2: Open the INI and look for ""texture_quality=1""

    * 1=high
    * 2=medium
    * 3=low
    * 4=very low

It's fine when you're slamming down Vaal's huge body but in other situation you're screen is crowded with small, quick moving monkeys, spiders and god know what else. On top of that your party members are spaming graphic intensive flashy skills that lags AND clutter up your entire screen. So hitting anyone at all becomes a chore at that point. And when you're not targeting anything properly, a single target skill just lets you stand there swinging away at thin air doing 0 DPS, doing 0 Life Leech and more often than not, dying.

What I'd love is something like Flicker Strike, where if you're not targeting anything, it targets the closest available mobs. There - no more standing around like an idiot. At least if you cant hit something you want, at least you're hitting something.

1360270215.0,58,self.pathofexile,18346s,"Why I disagree on most posts about crafting, and how I think about it in general.",Morsexier,86,28,65,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/18346s/why_i_disagree_on_most_posts_about_crafting_and/,"I cannot disagree more with some of the threads posting about crafting so I wanted to post my thoughts about it. For one, people all too often seem to consider crafting in a vacuum. I am sure we could come to some general consensus if we had player data from say 1000 players and their crafting methods and outcomes to generalize which is the proper crafting method (*chaos method* vs *R+E^3* method). Since we do not have that data yet, unless Chris wants to post some economy stats for us, I feel as though we can try to view the process from the perspective of maximization of outcomes.  
  
There are 6 possible stats on a rare, your objective should always be to achieve one of these outcomes:
  
* Maximum efficiency, low reward aka 5-6 good stats, all of medium quality.(1 chaos in 35?)
* Minimum efficiency, max reward, aka 2-3 maxed stats, hopefully 2 other good stats.(1 chaos in 50?)
* Perfect rare (duh obviously) 5 or 6 stats all of high or highest quality.  (1 chaos in 200?)
      
The issue I take with how many people think about crafting comes from several perspectives. 
  
* Almost always better to trade for an item. --The examples of people who chaos or alch once and get a crazy item are anecdotal, and have no bearing on how you should operate.--
* If people operated solely on the above, ie trading only, there would be a dearth of good items in the economy.   
* The odds of someone creating\finding a rare that is so good that they also wont use is fairly low (but does still happen). Example--  Inva finds his crazy dagger, says, “ok I’ll make some crazy dagger CI build.”
  
Your objective should therefore be to leverage your currency in such a way as to maximize your possible outcomes. 
  
In my mind to do this you need to decide for yourself many the values of certain items in relation to each other.
  
**Long wall of text about crafting:**
  
When you transmute and alt an item to maximize two stats, all you have done in my mind is waste that currency. At this point to compete with a 6 stat “maximum efficiency” item, you need to ‘win’ at least two more rolls, a regal and an exalt. Let’s just assume it took 30 alterations to get a very good blue you would regal. So basically a 5 or 6 stat chest in trade chat at this point must trade for 1 exalt, 1 regal, and 30 alterations in currency for this method to even have the potential to break even (though in reality, your regal and exalted orb fail far more than they succeed.)
  
However, should you have a 5 or 6 link item, what is the best way to craft it while maintaining your leverage and buying power in the economy?  To better understand my perspective on this, I think we need to take a look at the true value of an exalted. The value is derived from two parts, its rarity in the general economy according to our understanding of the drop rates, and what the orb actually does upon consumption. 
The main issue with this orb is that its value is directly related to the item it is being used on.
When being used on a 3 stat rare, and should it produce a positive outcome (1 in 20 in my closed beta experiences- I had approximately 120 exalteds from races), you still need to use another exalted to exceed the value of the maximum efficiency rare. This ratio I present is no doubt skewed by the fact that I did 2 times exalt one very good 4 stat amulet and end up with a 6 stat perfect. And that is a perfect example of anecdotal evidence that does nothing except deceive our simple monkey brains into thinking that method is awesome when you have that outcome in your first 3 items you exalt. 40 exalts would likely buy me 99.98% of the items in the game, or the ability to buy a mirror and copy the .02% of items people would never trade like a 6L 6 stat all good chest.
  
Should you have an amazing item, 4-5 ideal stats for you, in nearly perfect rolls, on an item you would never replace, what is the value of the exalted in relation to this item? The answer is nothing because it adds zero value to the item and deprives you of a currency you could use to trade for a better item in another slot. You would also be highly unlikely to accept anything other than a stupidly and highly overvalued offer of currency for the item *(I can’t speak for anyone here, my 6 stat maximum efficiency boots I would not trade for anything other than a trade the person shouldn’t be doing)*. The point where an exalted adds value to your current item set is the same point at which the currency becomes valueless for you, because you either have so many of them that + or -5 doesn’t matter, or your gear cannot be upgraded in a meaningful way.   
  
**The Way I think about Exalts**  
  
Another way to think about it is that exalting a very good rare to fill the last slot should always complement the least valuable aspect of what you are trying to achieve with your build. For instance a ground slam marauder has gear with life&gt;Resists&gt;Armor&gt;STR\Dex\AttkSpd (depending on slot, AttkSpd&gt;Life&gt; rest for gloves\rings etc you get the idea).   
  
This means that a rare worthy of exalting already has the first three-four stats and you are looking to be gifted the 5th. I am aware that occasionally you find or create a rare, sticking with gloves here, that has something like +IAS, life leech, 2 resists, and 37 Dex. This means you can exalt life if you value life so much that you cannot live without it on every item. However this item is already worth 2-3 exalteds likely to many people, but if you exalt you have a 1 in ~90 chance on a non hybrid armor to get the max life roll, or in reality 4 in 90 chance (the 4 highest life rolls) to make a perfect type of item. If you exalt you decrease the value of the item, both in trade and in general unless you get life.   
  
So could you trade 23 exalteds for the above described perfect item? Seems very likely, or also trade for a mirror to copy it.
  
**The inflation of certain orbs**  
  
Furthermore you cannot craft exalted orbs. Currently in my inventory despite selling all of my rares for 3 days of /played time, I have ~30 Chaos orbs of rares in my inventory.  In essence the game pays you in the form of Chaos over time (play to convert to pay to win).  

  
Remembering that you can die at any time in hardcore, which is the economy that I am focused on though I think the principles remain mostly the same, using something like 25% of your available currency to chaos a 5L chest, 4L gloves\boots\helm Ilvl 73 above or better with the objective of sticking with the first maximum efficiency rare you create. This is so you can save currency for a period of time improving all aspects of your gear to the point that you can choose any method you feel is superior to shoot for that Sky Rockets in Flight moment of a perfect 5 or 6 stat rare.
     
This is contingent as always on the trading economy, but seeing the trade value of a 5L(seems to be 1-2 exalts) helps to put this into perspective.
From this point, we can decide, 
  
* 1. Should I use an exalt, with the terrible odds to get the extremely important stat I **require** on gear
* 2. Should I use an exalt on an item that already does everything I need, for some bonus
* 3. Should I accumulate exalteds to trade for a very good item that improves my overall gear in a way more beneficial than 2
* 4. Should I exalt an item that has 5 great stats, including the two or three most important ones(this is the only one I think makes sense). In other words, regardless of outcome you wouldn’t replace this item either way of the outcome of the exalted roll.
  
Further trying to TLDR myself, you need to use some portion of your currency on crafting while maintaining enough reserve to purchase good items inversely related to your overall gear level.
  
For some more reading about how I think about crafting.

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy
  
It is easy enough to create, and if there is enough desire I can publish what I have, a simulator in excel for possible gear outcomes and run the sample over 10,000 Chaos, exalts etc and you will begin to see the point I am trying to make.

In the last week and a half I know of 4 friends who ""quit"" the game because of various attitudes towards the maps system.  After reading  similair stories in this subreddit I will try to give a critique of the pros/cons of the maps system, my personal experience with maps, and what I feel the new players out there should know so that they don't get burned out too quickly.  Wall of text incoming.

**Before 10.3b (The map drop increase patch; more drops outside of maps and higher lvl maps dropping slightly more often**)

* My experience - My first couple characters were a dual totem witch and a LA ranger(lvl 84/83 respectively), and my current shadow is 88.  I had a blast leveling and the anticipation of being able to test my char against the next zone was palpable.  I would prepare myself due to the fact I knew that gear upgrades, skill gem lvls, and skill points were coming. After beating Piety on Merciless difficulty, you look around and say, ok wow I guess I can level really fast in docks now til 70-71.  After this I can just hop into maps right? 

* Maps - during that first month me and my small group of friends I had found online ran maps NON STOP.  Those 66 maps with the new tilesets, variations of bosses, and higher Ilvl loot were phenomenal.  If our group pooled maps, we hardly ever ran out.  However there were a few issues:

* Map drop rates felt ok in the 66-67 maps we were doing, but it seemed 68 maps were something relatively special.  

* When doing maps in a set group of people, and the map maker got all the maps, you realized that you had to be online at the same time as the map 'carrier' of the group.  If you weren't you would miss out on content that you contributed to finding earlier.  If you tried to go find your own maps you would usually go to docks and try your luck there.  This made me and many high level friends worried because it seemed like you would have to grind out much lower level content jsut to be occasionally be rewarded with a higher level map. 

I personally never got a 71+ map  in all my time playing on my ranger and witch, and only was able to join in/buy into a few 70+ runs.

(And yes I read Chris's post about chisels and making the maps harder (regalling/alching/chaosing/exalting, etc and tried most of those methods while i was still relatively new)

**COME 10.3b Patch**

* First of all let me say this patch is awesome.  And the patch before with new map types was awesome too.  I always hear in global chat and from my lower level friends that they feel map drops have been increased SIGNIFICANTLY in zones outside of maps themselves.  This is great for newer players because they no longer have to spend alchemy or farm docks for hours to get a base of maps to use.  

* I went from having about 30-40 lvl 66-67-68 and never getting those 70+ to consistently finding 69's if I rolled my maps 'correctly'.  Also currently have about 25-35 70+ maps saved up.
 I am curently using a full map tab to run redditors through(the 'you get all loot thread') from the past few days.  After finding a build I absolutely LOVE playing(ek shadow), i am extremely jazzed to get to all the new content, but also to help my fellow lower lvld reddtiors.....  The **free redditor runs** stash tab: http://imgur.com/S4QT2Bp  It usually never drops below the reserve maps at the bottom, due to redditors finding more 66-68 maps nowadays an donating.  BTW: Having a lvl 75+ map drop feels better than a unique dropping. ^_^

But there are still **issues** regarding variance of map drop rates and investment needed.  

* The friends I mentioned earlier all quit/took a break from the game because even after significant currency and time investments into the maps, they ended up with nothing in return and would have to return to the lvl 66 or 67 maps. As one of them put it ""I am tired of having to play a slot machine for a chance to do content I am geared/leveled for.  Now I understand we shouldn't feel entitled to do high level maps. For example a lvl 74 map should be obtained much less than a 72.

* It takes a HUGE currency investment to sustain maps. Something that the average POE player probably wont be able to do for 50 maps in a row.  For example I would estimate I spend 2-3 GCP on each 70+ map.  First I chisel it 4 times, then I alch it, then I chaos it to hopefully get 90%+.  I don't really exalt maps anymore because I feel that the 17-18 chaos that I could get with an exalt would get me huge quantities in less rolls, if that makes any sense (I usually get maze for indoor maps in about 3-6 chaos rolls).  Taking into account I have a shop which supplies me a steady stream of income, I was still just barely breaking even.  For many players this is just not possible, and with chisel prices the way they are going, newer players won't be able to get  that little push once their lvling found chisels run out.

* I know RNG is RNG, but going 5+ maps with not a single map drop would really make a newer player wonder what they are doing wrong with their maps.  Not to mention now you have to plan how you are going to get and pay for more maps instead of enjoying the content itself. 

* For those who think ""You can probably just buy higher lvl maps"", this is just not the case.  I tried for a couple days to test trade chat/forums/general chat and very few people have 70+ maps, and even less are selling them.  When I posted a maps tab on my shop forum, I got MANY whispers the same day about buying the maps. 

-Also please dont get me wrong, I LOVE going back to 66-67 maps sometimes and just clearing everything fast, feeling like a boss, and reminiscing on how difficult this mod/map used to be!  I know many people put on the IIQ/IIR and go to town nonstop on 66-67 because they find that to be super fun.  However **I would just like higher lvl players to have more options, while allowing newer players to see a good portion of the game.**


**Quick Overview and Suggestions**

-TL;DR Entry into maps is easier than never now, new patch is great.  Sustaining them is becoming a bit of a problem.

-Forgive the Diablo 3 reference, but perhaps make a system where maps above a certain quantity bonus give something akin to nephalem valor stacks where for example a map with 100+% quantity would never drop below a 67 or 68 map.  Or perhaps in a full party of 6 people, maps have 2 'charges' OR maps that have a chance of dropping each run where their mods CANNOT be changed ---&gt; resulting in more people wanting to do group play / trade maps.   These are just a couple things I thought of while writing the bullet point so don't judge too harshly haha. 

Everyone have a great weekend!!!!!!!!

You remember the sc2 screen? Where it r*ped your graphic card to pieces? I noticed, while getting disconnected again that my fan went from 20% to 60-80%. My GPU-load was at 90-100% and has been since I got to the login screen. 

Would be terrific if the developers could set a fps-limit here so that some graphic cards doesn't burn up while waiting in queue. This is only related to some cards but it is still an issue.

I also posted in the forum [here](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/73004), and it looks like (a) the actually rolling mechanics are a bit different, and (b) this analysis has already been done. At least I got to look like I was doing work when writing the analysis scripts!

TL;DR - Don't try to roll a 6L.

-----

Many of you have probably seen [this gif](http://i.imgur.com/QjUbr.gif) of someone burning through Fusing Orbs trying to generate a 5L or a 6L, with no success. I got curious as to how the links were determined. It wouldn't make sense for it to be strictly random for each link... if each link had a 50% chance of occurring, you would expect to get a 6L every 32 Fusings. But if the chance was much lower, say 25%, it would be difficult to even get a 3L or 4L.

I decided to analyse the rolls from the gif. There are 262 separate fusing rolls (!!!). A quick script to load the image and compare pixel colors at certain locations gave me the the average frequency of links occurring. From the data:

    6S analysis (n=262)
        Link frequency by location:  0.675, 0.469, 0.477, 0.568, 0.423
        Overall link frequency: 0.522

Interesting. My first guess as to the method (and which appears to be somewhat accurate), is that each link is rolled based on whether it is connected to another link. Consider, if the link in question is not connected (either the first link to be rolled, or the previous link was not created), it has a 2/3 chance of being created. However, if it *is* going to connect to an already created link, it only has a 1/3 chance.

For example, with a 6 socket item, the first (top) link has a 2/3 chance of being created. Let's say it does. Now the next link, in the top right, only has a 1/3 chance of being created. The RNG gods are with us, it also gets created. Now it's a 3L item already. The third and center link is up, again with 1/3 chance... no dice, it is not created. The bottom left is up, but back to a 2/3 chance... success! The final link, at the bottom, is rolled with a 1/3 chance.

To test my hypothesis, I ran a quick simulation based on the above probabilities. The results:

    Simulation (n=10,000)
        Link frequency by location: 0.673, 0.452, 0.523, 0.502, 0.499
        Overall link frequency: 0.530

As you can see, it matches up pretty well with the data from the 6S fusing images. I believe this is in fact how socket linking is rolled in PoE. It explains why links in general are common, but why multi-linked items are more rare.

Furthermore, if this is correct, the chance of rolling a 3L on a 3S item is (2/3)\*(1/3) = 2/9, or about 22%. The chance of getting 4L from a 4S item is (2/3)\*(1/3)\*(1/3) = 2/2, or 7.4%. If anyone has data on these, which either corroborate or refute these data, please let me know.

Happy PoEing.

-----

Edit: More analysis, looking at each link and its frequency as a function of the previous link existing.

    When Link0=True, Link1 frequency is:  0.378  (n=177)
    When Link1=True, Link2 frequency is:  0.300  (n=123)
    When Link2=True, Link3 frequency is:  0.392  (n=125)
    When Link3=True, Link4 frequency is:  0.342  (n=149)

    When Link0=False, Link1 frequency is:  0.674  (n=83)
    When Link1=False, Link2 frequency is:  0.642  (n=137)
    When Link2=False, Link3 frequency is:  0.740  (n=135)
    When Link3=False, Link4 frequency is:  0.540  (n=111)

Pretty clear trend.

-----

Edit2 OH GOD I CAN'T STOP

It actually looks like the chance decreases progressively with each successful link roll.

Two successive links:

    When Link0=True and Link1=True, Link2 frequency is:  0.268 (n=67)
    When Link0=False and Link1=True and Link2=True, Link3 frequency is:  0.210 (n=19)
    When Link1=False and Link2=True and Link3=True, Link4 frequency is:  0.222 (n=45)[/quote]

Three successive links:

    When Link0=True and Link1=True and Link2=True, Link3 frequency is:  0.0 (n=18)
    When Link1=True and Link2=True and Link3=True, Link4 frequency is:  0.0 (n=4)[/quote]

So after the first roll at ~66%, the second is about 33% (edit 1). But on the third roll (to make a 4L), it's down to ~25%. The next, to make a 5L, is very low. Zero out of 22 tries from the data.

Side note, I also made a thread on the forums [here](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/73004).

(MAYBE) FINAL EDIT: ~~Chris~~ Mark replied to my forum thread stating how the links are rolled. I think it's mathematically equivalent, but with different percentage values.

My solution is whichever is most beneficial to the entire group. I find myself grouping with randoms (yeah I know) where people are cursing and re-cursing so their curse stays. I typically run elemental weakness, since MOST builds can benefit from it in some way. But I find myself in one of two situations normally:  

1: Group of casters, of all elements, I cast elemental weakness, and some dual ice spear totem guy casts frostbite. Although that helps me being a freeze pulse kind of guy, but the LA Ranger and the pure fire guy aren't doing a whole lot anymore. Plus, isn't this about killing speed anyway? By the time stuff gets frozen on Docks anyway, its dead. Now maybe this would be better on dangerous maps, but I would think enfeeble is instantly a better choice.   

2: In a group, 1 melee character, and they constantly cast Warlord's Mark, which only leeches on physical, and there's only 1 of him, and 5 casters. I get that maybe solo that would help survivability, but you have 5 other guys aggro-ing mobs. I would also argue that if you are dependant on Life Leech, you'd have the gem equipped and some of it on gear. And if the End. Charges are your thing, I think Enduring Cry is a MUCH better way to go.   

I have had people to tell me to stop casting my curse because theirs is ""better"", and they end up quitting since I don't see why Critical Weakness is helping that much vs. a clear 20%-40% damage boost to most builds with Elemental Weakness.   

Thoughts? Am I wrong here? Should it just be a curse-to-re-curse FFA?

Myself and a lot of people have brought to attention the fact that the clusterfuck of spell effects makes group play dangerous and not fun. You can't see anything going on. 

What makes it even worse is the damn summoners and totem users in every group. While there's nothing wrong with the builds themselves, it overloads the screen with characters and spell effects, making it very difficult to see what's going on.

Other people claim not to have this problem and even deny it exists. They typically play the game on low graphic settings. I play with everything maxed and don't believe turning everything down should be mandatory to play in groups.

Solution:

Add in an option to remove party spell effects or severely limit them. Seeing the 20 minions' auras does nothing to enhance our gameplay. As for seeing the other party members' spell effects.. It can be useful to some extent but they could be stripped down to the minimum. As long as I see the guy shooting arrows, I know what he's doing.

",g3arx,63,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/yav6y/august_16_progress_update/,"link to forum - http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/46188

It's been a little while since we posted a public progress update, so I've put together some notes on how various things are going. This isn't intended to be a long post!

Last week, we passed a million American dollars of supporter packs sold (after credit card fees have been deducted). Thank you all very much for your generous contributions - it's helping the game in so many ways. Projects like this cost many millions of dollars, so while it's awesome that we have enough money to see the game through to Open Beta, the long-term future of the project benefits greatly from any additional money we can raise. Our team is currently at 18 people, though we'd love to expand it so that we can generate content at a faster rate.

At the moment, several people are working on producing and preparing the physical items that supporters will receive (t-shirts, posters and copies of the game DVD/soundtrack CD). We're trying to get these sent out as soon as possible, though it's looking like it'll take a few more weeks to receive the produced goods before we can ship them. I'll update with more exact dates once we hear back from our suppliers. It turns out that the logistics of preparing and shipping literally thousands of packages is a bit of an undertaking!

We recently added the top three twitch.tv Path of Exile livestreams to the bottom of the pathofexile.com front page. If you'd like your stream to be featured on this list, just set your game to Path of Exile and try to get a lot of people to watch you play! They're ranked in order of number of concurrent viewers. I've been visiting streams occasionally to answer questions, and I hope to find more time to do so in the future. I've had great voice conversations with Ash, Raijin, Kripparrian and Arioc so far. We're also occasionally giving keys to streamers so that they can do giveaways.

One of our priorities over the last few months has been to create and post interesting videos on our YouTube channel. Videos are a really good way of getting new players interested in the game and also allow us to show things to existing players in a very visual way. I've been really enjoying doing the Build of the Week series, as it helps draw attention to the amazing build variety that our community comes up with in the game. There are dozens more awesome builds that people have submitted that I hope to eventually feature in later videos. If you want to submit a build, this is the current thread. If you haven't yet seen the one-year retrospective video where we compare the current 0.9.11 build with last year's 0.9.0 build, I highly recommend it.

As the size of our Beta playerbase has grown, we've ramped up the number of weekend event leagues that we run. For a long time, we just ran a three hour hardcore ladder race, but a few weeks ago we added a one hour cut-throat one as well. This weekend we're offering two cut-throat events (one of them is at a time that hopefully suits European players), and a three-hour hardcore race that disallows partying. Please understand that we run these events on our own weekends, so it's difficult to pick times that are great for everyone. In the future, we intend to further ramp up the number of events that we hold (I'd expect it to hit 4 or 5 per week in the coming weeks, and even more once we enter Open Beta).

We also ran a successful two-week hardcore race a few weeks ago, to test the 0.9.11 balance. This was our alternative to doing a legacy migration, and we received substantial amounts of balance data from it. We are looking at running another similar league in the near future because people enjoyed that one. The new one may be one week long. I understand there has been demand for a ""time-limited"" league where you only get a certain number of hours per day (to favour people like me with jobs), but there are logistics issues to solve before we can do that.

From a development point of view, we've been working hard on the 0.9.12 patch. This patch focuses on many areas, including:
Adding PvP, including arenas with simple matchmaking, and dueling. Teams of up to 6 on either side are supported.
Rebalancing minions and fixing their bugs. Yes, the ability to have multiple sets of minions using multiple gems of the same type is a bug.
New item hover art!
Arrows are now real projectiles rather than faked long-range melee attacks. This means they can be dodged by running out of the way, as well as by the evasion roll.

We don't yet know when 0.9.12 will be deployed (or put on Alpha). My guess is that it's a few weeks away from being ready. I'll definitely post more information as soon as we know.

In addition to the work on 0.9.12, we've been pulling out as many fixes and features as we can and integrating them into 0.9.11 in the form of (almost daily) small patches. These allow us to fix problems faster, get feedback on changes earlier, and keep you guys on your toes with a stream of small changes between major patches. The latest of these patches, 0.9.11k, should be deployed within the next day.

We're aware of several client stability issues that can manifest in the form of either graphical glitches or a crash. We have never seen this happen in our office (despite it happening occasionally within the Beta community), so we're still gathering data that will let us fix it. This is a priority, but as with all things that require data collection and research, is taking some time to solve.

I'm extremely pleased with how the last few months have gone and am getting very excited about Open Beta. I can't wait for you guys to see Act Three.

[This search function on POETradechat.com](http://poetradechat.com/search.php) is still in beta, and will be tweaked and improved in the coming days.

The search will look into all trade lines and search for keywords.  If you are looking for a phrase, then use quotations (""Kaoms Heart"").  The problem at this time is the script doesnt distingush between the different linked items, and it searched through out the whole line. If your search contains a ( ' ) try the search with and without the '

In the future I will have an indexer similar to poe.xyz.is.

Thank you GGG, and the POE community again for everything.

I will explain how it now works. First, a dev has posted to clarify things:

http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/466089/page/1#p4110078

&gt; ""I do use Lioneye bow""

&gt; This is your problem, reflect has been changed to take your accuracy (or chance to hit), versus you evasion (chance to evade). Prior to the patch this was monster accuracy, versus player evasion.

&gt;Due to Lioneye's Glare granting a stat that gives your attacks 100% chance to hit (""Hits can't be evaded""), you now cannot evade your own reflected damage when using that bow, or other mechanics the same or similar to it (for example Resolute Technique).

Now that reflect uses your own accuracy and evasion, there is a sweet spot where you will have enough accuracy to hit monsters but not enough accuracy for reflected damage to go through your own evasion.

Here is the accuracy formula:
Chance to Hit = Attacker's Accuracy / ( Attacker's Accuracy + (Defender's Evasion / 4) ^ 0.8 ) 

Plugging in 10,000 evasion and 1000 accuracy into the formula, you get 65.6% chance to hit, or in other words, 34.3% chance to evade your own reflect damage. With ondar's guile that is 68.7% chance to evade your own reflect damage. 

As can be seen, it will be very possible to get 95% chance to evade your own reflected damage. 

Due to the way that reflect damage works, the ""hits cannot miss"" on lioneye's glare is actually now bad for some builds. It is still very good for builds that use iron reflexes, but evasion builds may want to go for a high dps rare bow so that they receive near immunity to reflect damage.

 As explained in the [last reflect damage PSA I posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1hfhdl/psa_kripparian_was_wrong_about_reflect_damage/),  reflect damage is not effected by reduced or increased damage mods on a monster or map.

(I don't know how to format blank spaces here :(




* Shared stash tabs. We know that you have already been talking about this, and it's something we are really looking forward to. But this is something that would be ""needed"" right now. I will bring up a few points why.




* Map&amp;Currency pools: People share their maps and currency to roll these, and managing this through a shared stash tab would help us so much. Right now we are simply asking eachother to help out with currency, and linking around spreadsheets to keep track.




* 1 Week/1 Month races: This is why I decided to make this post in the first place. With the 1 month coming up, and a couple of 1week races behind us, shared stash tabs would just.. It would make things in-freaking-credibly easier. We were talking around just now in mumble, talking about just how awesome it would be to have this implemented before the 1 month. We know that this is very unlikely, as there are probably more important things for you guys to think of right now. But speaking for me and my team, we would gladly give up a couple of 'fix' patches in order to get this implemented ASAP.



* Guilds/Clans: This would serve like a guild bank, as many of us have experience with in the past. I am not saying ""hey we wants a guild bank"", but rather making a point to bring up the convenience again.




* Guilds/Clan chats, or atleast custom chat channels to play with until guilds/clans are out. This is also something that we would just love. We have an established team + friends we would like to integrate into the game itself, rather than only hanging out in our mumble. This would make linking items ingame easier, managing stuff around and so on. The possibilities have no end! :)

I wont drag this out more than I have to, and again I would like to point out that this is not nagging in any way. This is just what we are prioritizing as important to us right now.

If I were to assume that they are exactly what they appear to be (rings for survivability, amulets for attributes) then I feel the system is too shallow, especially with the fall off of the per slot effectiveness of these items in the late game. I feel like the explicit properties of jewelry are perfect, very deep affix pool.

My idea, add new base types of jewelry:

-Possible Types:

+ **Diamond Ring:** 20% Global Crit Chance, 10% Global Crit Multiplier

+ **Onyx Ring:** 7-10 All Attribute, 10 Life, 10 Mana 

+ **Amethyst Ring:** 8-12% Chaos Resistance

+ **Jade Ring:** 120-150 Accuracy, 3-5% increased Evasion

+ **Lapis Ring:** 15-20% Mana regen, 2-4% increased Energy Shield

+ **Amber Ring:** 8% Increased non-spell damage (not sure if weapon damage applies to everything but spells), 5-8% increased Armor.

+ **Granite Amulet:**  5% Physical damage reduction (doesn't over-cap)

+ **Mercury Amulet:** 4-8% Increased Movement Speed, 2-5% increased attack speed, 2-5% increased cast speed
  
Obviously with more base types I think it only makes sense to increase the drop rates of jewelry. Opinions welcome, more base type suggestions also welcome.

EDIT: I didn't account for the attribute direct bonuses, 10 all Attribute adds 5 life, 2% melee phys dmg, 20 accuracy, 2% increased evasion, 5 mana, 2% increased energy shield.

What this means is that a player with 1 exalted (following POEEX rates) can trade his exalted for 20 chaos. Then, with this chaos, he can get 6 gcp (18 chaos-6 gcp), and have 2 chaos leftover. You can turn the gcp back into an exalted, with a net profit of 2 chaos. Basically, this shit defies the basic identity property of math, and causes 1=1.1. It causes exalted orbs to exponentially inflate in value. Smart players have noticed this, and demand exalted orbs because they not only hold value, but increase in value extremely quickly. Holding money in ""lower orbs"" becomes a losing strategy.  This is really horrible for the economy, and is causing hyperinflation - (the prices have increased from 18 chaos-1 exalt : 20chaos:1 exalt, over 10% increase in a week, this is all according to POEEX). Please, please stop using this website. 

As a potential solution to the exploitation of the fractional currency dilemma, it would be nice to be able to modify currency into shards of itself. Without ""cents"" we would be forced to round dollars, and we could get screwed into really bad inflation. Also, don't use websites aimed at inflating currencies in order to sell higher priced orbs for real life money.

I just now removed the post: http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1glrmx/moderators_are_actively_censoring_posts_that_are/ Because the comment section was way too heated and also because the title was misleading (despite the irony of me removing that post). More importantly, however, because a response to the actual complaint of removed image posts will be dealt with in this thread.

Firstly, I would like to assure you that, checking over the moderation logs, not a single discussion post of the rules has been removed by moderators recently - besides the above mentioned post. We totally encourage discussion of the rules, they were created in co-operation with the users of the subreddit a few months back, after all.

Re: removal of image posts

Occasionally, things are posted that don't quite fit within the definitions of rules explicitly but where they detract from the quality of the subreddit. *I am talking about no specific post here, just in general*. So far, we have had a lot of success with just allowing mod discretion to deal with these posts. Since the rule change there has only been one posted complaint about the results of this process. But, there is definitely evidence that people are concerned about it, shown by the heated comments section in the above-removed post.

Pyrodan, myself and all of the other mods (besides the ladder bot and auto mod) are users of this subreddit first - we want to see it thrive and do well. As such, we are willing to hear that our moderation methods aren't working 100%. Please, consider posting about this in a reasonable manner without resorting to mod bashing. *We are people too :'(*

**Because of this discourse we will trial moderating image posts explicitly to the rules for a while.** To elaborate, this means not removing images that aren't covered by the current rules as considered by the 'reasonable person' 

The way images are currently handled:

- memes (upvote bait that ends up pushing away discussion and quality posts)

- image macros (covers things that aren't considered memes but are of the same standard)

- loot drops (some people like them and they can be fun in moderation but last time a discussion was held the majority was against allowing these because they tend to flood the sub)

- funny pics (defined loosely as an image post that is designed with the intention of provoking a chuckle or sharp exhale and an upvote within a few seconds - these are disallowed for the same reason as memes).

- Direct linking of images is not currently cause for post removal - they are only removed if they fall under one of the above categories.

If, after, say, a few weeks it can be seen that the image rule isn't covering everything that should be removed we'll call for a re-vote on that rule.

To keep things from going crazy please report posts that you think 100% don't belong here - whether they are covered in the rules or not. We will pay attention to those and if posts get 5-10+reports we'll then remove them. It'll also be nice data for rule development.

****

Hopefully that covers it, if there are any further thoughts or concerns please post them below but please refrain from mod bashing. No one is stepping down unless they want to, *please do not send death threats to mods*. Overall, I think we can agree this sub has been pretty awesome. I love checking here 5-100 times a day.

Edit: I will be upvoting ALL posts that add to the discussion, whether I agree or not.

RNG stands for Random Number Generator, which is the mechanism behind randomness in this game. It determines the drops you get, the affixes you roll on your items, and the layout of your instances, among other things.

When we give feedback on a certain element of RNG in the game, there are two different questions we can ask:

1. Should this event be more likely? Less likely?
2. Should this event be RNG at all? 

At first glance, RNG seems inherently unfair. If we're playing the same game, why should I *randomly* get better rewards than you?

However, the existence of RNG encourages players, because there are three ways to 'beat' randomness in the short run:

1. Get lucky: *get a good outcome from an event*
2. Play more: *get more events*
3. Play smarter: *maximize the gain from good outcomes, minimize the loss from bad outcomes*

While the outcome of a single event is determined entirely by chance, over a [large number of events](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), the average outcome can be expected. This means that any two players will have the same RNG in the long run. This also means a single player's 'bad RNG' streaks are roughly equal to his 'good RNG' streaks.

This also means that, with Path of Exile's large population of players, *a change to the odds of an event will directly affect the distribution of its outcomes*. 

**So when someone says ""fusing a 6L should be twice as likely"", they are also saying ""there should be twice as many 6Ls available""** (or more than twice as many, since people may be more willing to attempt fusings with the new odds). The same effect can be achieved by adjusting the drop rate of fusings or jeweller's.

So, when evaluating our first question ""Should this event be more likely? Less likely?"" we only need to look at the players who have already achieved the 'good' outcome. Let's say 1% of all players have a 6L- does 1% reflect the [""pinnacle of achievement""](http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1dtct8/dominion_6linking_his_shavronnes_after_over_6000/c9u13ly) it's supposed to be?

When evaluating our second question ""should this event be RNG at all?"", we should revisit the gameplay benefits that we would sacrifice:

1. Getting lucky: *big drops would be less exciting* [:{O](http://i.imgur.com/LIR6QPo.jpg).
2. Playing more: *if we can expect x outcome within y events, why play more than y events?*
3. Playing smarter: *less randomness means less opportunities for min-maxing*

Recently there have been a lot of changes in Path of Exile in response to community feedback on RNG- for example, the drop rates of high level maps and the crafting process of fusing 6-linked chests. 

It can only be a good thing that the devs are paying such close attention to their community. However, this is also why **we need to be careful what we wish for**.

The game is both engaging and frustrating at the same time, meaning that it's not a ""click to win"" kind of game. Even wasting XP when I die... I love it.

Now to the topic question: being based on the F2P model, where people can play for free or spend few bucks for cosmetic/utility stuff, do you think GGG developers will eb able to raise enough money to pay 18 salaries?

The pre-open-beta event had a lot of attention and many of us threw their money at GGG to grab some kiwis before they went extinct (*nice touch, by the way*). Also, some of us opted for the Diamond support, which means a good money donation from true enthusiasts.

Now we're in the open beta and the ""launch event"" is gone and already behind us. I don't have any number so I'm just speculating but... I guess that most of the potential paying customers have spent the money already (now or in the past months). I also think that future newcomers will approach the game as (*another*) good F2P videogame, where you play and have some fun for free... and that's it. 

PoE is not a ""for everyone"" game. It's not easy as other competitors, it can be hard and unforgivable, it does not feature an easy economy model (*no gold*) and the crafting stuff is quite... hard to understand, at least for those who didn't follow PoE in the last months.

Please don't get me wrong: I truly hope GGG will be able to engage the audience and gather more money. They deserve it, and the game is already in a very solid and polished state. Still, what will be the trick to earn decent money in the future, now that enthusiasts and beta testers (*aka: most of the fanbase, I suspect*) already spent their money? As said in another post, 18 people require 216 salaries per year. PoE is great and all but it's not gathering millions of people, and it's a free game after all.

I want to note that currently, there's a bug where gems that I don't have the full information for (like Trap) will bug the rest of the tree if you set it to level 20. Lower levels should work fine though. The gem summaries are not completely accurate because I don't have as of yet a system to check for allowed and disallowed support gems, so everything is added on. In the future I hope to get a list of all valid support gems for each skill (so I don't have weird cases like Viper Strike + Melee Splash and Poison Arrow + RAT).  

Once again, it has bugs and possibly old information. Anything you notice to be incorrect, report it here or on my official post on the forums [here.](http://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/486721/)  

Basic usage: Click on a socket, go to the menu, then find the gem you want and click on it. The slider on the right lets you change the level/quality. If changing the level too high causes the gem summary to disappear, it means that I don't have complete information for that gem for those levels (like Trap and Punishment). Use a lower level setting.  

Anyways, here it is: [http://poecraft.com](http://poecraft.com)

**Hey Diamond, Eternal and Unique Item Creator Supporters,**

On the weekend I saw this: [Link](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/History_of_Wraeclast)

It is quite an impressive amount of effort put into taking all the snippets of the Path of Exile lore and putting them into a history. I found it especially impressive, as I have access to the lore documents we start from, and I know how accurate it is.

The lore of the game is given out piecemeal in small elements like this, as Path of Exile is a game where the content is intended to be played through multiple times. It was cool for this theory to actually pay off - someone has taken the time to reverse engineer all the hints.

The holder of game lore is Erik Olofsson. Erik is one of the founders of Grinding Gear Games and is the Art Director (or Omnitect as he occasionally refers to his role). Edwin McRae, our writer, wrote most of the lore document, which gets referred to for everything we add into the game. This makes sure the lore is consistent, and over time reveals more of the whole story and history.

**0.11.1e**

The most recent patch included four unique items. This set of items included several powerful, and complicated items. A lot of them interacted with the current game meta in strong ways.

There has been some criticism over the power level of these items. This is something we take seriously, and we will keep an eye on how they affect the game.

This may mean upcoming items get additional scrutiny. We don’t want items that would prevent players wanting to aim for a better rare for an item slot. We don’t want items with many complicated special mods, unless the item really earns it. We generally find an item with one interesting mod has plenty of impact and meaning for players.

**The next patch**

The 0.11.2 patch will probably be deployed early next week with some new unique items.

We have three unique items likely to go in. Two are looking like build enablers, and the other is one of the first unique items I worked on that has been waiting for a cosmetic effect.

**Insider Info**

This weeks insider info includes an excerpt from our lore:

Archbishop Geofri of Phrecia Cathedral (Fellshrine Ruins)

Templar and theologian, Geofri was a stoic of the Eternal Faith. He deplored anything thaumaturgical, and was therefore disgusted when Chitus installed Maligaro’s laboratory into the Phrecian Forest, not a stone’s throw from Geofri’s Phrecia Cathedral (now the Fellshrine ruins). It was Geofri who coined the title, “Chamber of Sins” for Maligaro’s lab.

Geofri plotted with High Templar Voll to destroy Maligaro and his work, but Maligaro got wind of the building threat. Maligaro’s pre-emptive strike put an end to the plot, and to Geofri who was slain with Maligaro’s Etcher at the foot of Saint Corutino the Golden Hand’s Shrine.

Archbishop Geofri remains in Fellshrine to this day, animated by The Twist into a Brittle Templar of some power.",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,hardcore,True,t3_1hu138,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1hu138/eternal_and_diamond_supporter_newsletter_20/,

4) When should i start to use Orb of Chance or Orb of Alchemy ? What itemlevel should the item be?

5) How can i find out what item i can get lets say from a Glourious Plate ( i know they roll Kaoms Heart) if i roll it? Because if i know what it rolls than i would obviously only roll items i need

In 70+ maps, a non-acro character begins to fear being 2-3 shot by quite a few enemies. Many characters rely on a high armor value and/or Stoneskin Flasks to not die against them. A character with Acrobatics **and** a shield with 75% block, on the other hand, can only realistically achieve around a 95% effective chance for an enemy's attack to not land (which then gets floored by any champ/rare with additional accuracy). With no armor, all an enemy needs is a 5% chance to hit you to potentially one-shot you, no matter how many HP nodes you have. 

To top it all off, Acrobatics is a five point investment to get it to 30%, and then another point for a small 20% chance to dodge spells. Even your new CI doesn't require that heavy of a point investment. CI also doesn't have a champ/rare modifier that absolutely destroys it as a defense type.

Hello Diamond Supporters!

I am planning to make sending this newsletter a weekly event on Mondays (New Zealand time).

I am sending this one a little earlier, as I will be attending a short conference in Wellington for the New Zealand games industry.

**0.10.2**

This week the 0.10.2 patch will be released onto Open Beta.

Aside from a skill, several balance changes and a couple of new microtransactions, it will be include 4 unique items, three of them created by Diamond supporters (Metronomy, DevilJade and LeHeup80).

We have three unique items essentially ready for the week after in 0.10.3, however they need to be fully tested and signed off.

We are still working on the processes for getting 3d artwork for the unique items in game. You may have seen that some of the unique items have full 3d artwork now, such as Death’s Harp, however we have many more to do.

I see that many of the high poly versions of new items have been done, these will then be converted into usable assets and rigged to the in-game characters.

**Avatars**

I have seen a couple of forum avatars ready to go, and Erik has now organised producing them regularly. When a forum avatar is ready you will be contacted for sign off, and should be able to to expect it up on the site within a week after that.

**Insider Info**

This week, I have some concept art for an upcoming microtransaction effect to show off:

&gt;There are also two things we remembered about recently that it turns out many advanced players don't know! They've been in the game for ages, but they were undocumented. The first is that you can hold alt (or whatever highlight key) while hovering an item in trade to see its item level. The other is that you can hover over an item with the mouse cursor and press Ctrl+C to copy its properties into your clipboard.

This should fix item level scams as long as you link the item shown in the trade window. 

EDIT: For some reason the alt-itemlevel thing doesn't work for me.

Being a newcomer myself but a veteran of the genre I wanted to share how I learned to create the fullest experience out of such games:

* 1.“Humble beginnings” – You are new to the game and decide to start with some class. You will suck. This first char will be your entrance to the game and is going to suffer for that. I don’t recommend starting on Hardcore right away because you will need to make mistakes and learn from them.  Just accept it – you will always remember this character fondly but he’s not going to get you to the top.

* 2.“Fun times” – You’ve learned a good deal already and also with many alts found the style of play that is the most comfortable to you. You start reading guides and tweaking your performance. You understand the game and it speaks to you.

* 3.“The gauntlet “ – now it’s all about effectiveness, changing your hat for the same hat but with 1% improvement on a stat is mandatory. You know guides by heart, you’ve probably written some wiki articles, game economy now makes more sense than real world economy. You are a force in PvE and PvP. Your stash is heavy with the best loot and yet there is some craving…

* 4.“The folly” – your knowledge and gear is so powerful you can’t hit anyone because all mobs and bosses run away from you.  That’s when you decide to switch to Hardcore completely. You have some loot from previous attempts but it’s beggar scraps compared to your SC stash. If you are lucky you are able to trade your SC for HC stuff with 90% loss of value and that will be great. HC will drive you mad and question your own sanity as one tiny mistake will end the life of your most successful character and you will love it.

* 5.“The enlightenment” – you’ve seen it all, you’ve been to the deepest dungeons and highest peaks, you’ve read your name on ladder scoreboards and noticed envy in never-blinking eyes of pixel opponents. There is no calling left unanswered, no map uncleared and no challenge unconquered. That’s when you crave the most unique experience – esoteric builds that would not survive in the hands of lesser men, your heavy-armored dual-wielding witch that sacrificed all her mana, your barbarian who doesn’t have a single use for his weapons except for spell improvement, your ranger that looks in the eyes of your enemies as he smashes the biggest two-handed maul into their skulls and yells with rage. And as the last hardcore boss of the highest difficulty falls below the character who shouldn’t even be alive after the first act, then you know – you’ve beaten the game.

I'm writing this post just to kind of record what I know, and also to help others think about this. I'm sure I'm completely wrong on some of these, so feel free to point it out if it's the case.


&gt;EDIT: A few notes before we begin:
&gt;Obviously, for CI builds you want +ES, for life builds you want +Life.
&gt;WED = Increased Elemental Damage with Weapons. For the below notes, these synergize with FED.
&gt;FED = Adds +Flat # Elemental Damage
&gt;IPD = Increased Phys Damage
&gt;Items with conflicting ele / phys damage, or +es and +life, are decreased in value as hybrids are not as popular.

&gt;Also, this is not meant to be the gospel or some crap like that, just a general guide.
====


* Wands:
-Phys builds: high +flat phys AND +% phys (i.e., 15-25 flat, AND 90+% increased), ias +Crit chance/multiplier. -Elemental builds: triple fire, ice, lightning flat dmg rolls with 30+ midpoint dps of each, crit chance/mult is good here too. -Spell builds:70+% total spell damage increase, &gt;100% preferable, plus 40+% spell crit chance, +Cast Speed (Anyone know what good numbers for Cast Speed are?) 

* Bows:
Thicket Bows and Imperial bows are good endgame, all others are not
-Phys builds: high +flat phys AND +% phys (i.e., 15-25 flat, AND 90+% increased), +7-15% ias.
-Elemental builds: triple fire, ice, lightning flat dmg rolls with 30+ midpoint dps of each, +7-15% ias. (Can triple +FED and +WED both roll on a bow? I haven't seen this, but it would be insane if so.)

* Melee Weapons: The same phys/elemental breakdowns as the above, but on 2h weapons phys is nearly always better.

* Daggers: ""It seems Physical Daggers with 100% inc Phys and a flat phys roll + increased Crit Chance makes for a really high price, somewhat similar to phys wands.
I haven't really seen any spellcrit daggers other than Divinarius, so that put aside I don't think they're popular."" --DLimited ""As for spell daggers, they can be very valuable, it's just rare to get one good enough for this to happen. It needs to have the 80% base, a ~90%+ crit roll, and a large amount of spell damage/% elemental damage (like 60%+). Bonus points for decent crit multi. These are practically non-existent, but they can be very effective if the build using it already has lots of cast speed from other sources and just wants more crit chance."" --Jihok

* Chests: A combination of +200-300 flat defense and +90+% increased defense, then high res rolls, and life if non-es

* Boots: Same as chest but need 20+% ms

* Gloves: Same as chest but +2% mana leech is good, and +ias is good. Rarity &amp; Quantity rolls are also good. +IPD Good for phys builds. Not sure if you can get WED on a glove?

* Hat: Same as chest, although Rarity &amp; Quantity rolls are good.

* Belt: Lots of either ES or Life, and then Res, and then perhaps +20+% WED

* Shield: Defense, Res, Life--also spell power rolls for ES shields.

* Quiver: Life, Res, +20+% WED, Flat Ele dmg, IPD, IAS.

* Rings: Varies widely but high resistance rolls and +life/+es are never wrong. High +flat ele dmg and Rarity &amp; Quantity rolls are good. +IPD Good for facebreaker/phys builds.

* Amulets:  +lots to all attributes, plus flat ele damage, +20+% WED, Rarity &amp; Quantity, +life/es, +global crit chance.+IPD Good for facebreaker/phys builds. +Life Leech good for some melee builds. +flat or %Armor/Eva good at high rolls too. ""cast speed, crit multiplier, % ES, resists (especially high +all res rolls), % elemental damage (i.e. 18% lightning damage), spell damage."" --Jihok

I'm currently playing a level 60 melee duelist and I'm scared to progress because my health yoyos so much in every fight with pretty good gear. The only melee build that seems to be somewhat viable is CI claw but even then its output is inferior to ranged and that's a really expensive late game build. No Kaoms no melee I guess. I started up a sporker hoping to  bankroll my main but it sucks that probably the best hardcore build (in terms of damage, survivability, and cost to gear up) in the game is so fucking boring...

I was joking around and asked Kripp on his stream if there was any possible way that GGG could make melee even remotely viable on hardcore... He said if they tripled the damage at least...

Personally I think melee is more engaging and fun and I want to know what you all think about what GGG can do to make melee at least close if not equal to the output of ranged.

My name is SocietyLee and I've been playing Path of Exile all day, non-stop since the start of open beta. For about a month now i've started working to make some helpful video guides and playthroughs for the game.

So far i've been focusing on helping newer to mid-level players get the information to get to the next level. 

I just uploaded my 2nd episode of a series i'm calling ""Exile Academy"". In this episode I discuss some basic guidelines for newer players, or maybe players who have just copied others builds in the past, so that they can perhaps come up with their own unique builds and have some more certainty that they're likely to stand up to late game content.

A link to the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veNMDwXhLAo

I'm still fairly new at this so please bear with me on the polish(which I feel is decent, but not to the highest standard). 

I spent a decent amount of time on the video so I hope it's helpful to someone.

Hey Diamond, Eternal and Unique Item Creator Supporters,

Race Season 3 finished yesterday. There were almost 1000 participants in the final Descent race. A new record was set, and the number 1 Duelist spot overtaken. We will be posting some fun Descent races soon. Season 4 planning is well underway and the season will begin on 24 August.

This week 0.11.4 will also be finished. It has turned into a large patch with a lot that needs testing. We’ll be fixing the outstanding issues and will be deploying it later this week.

Eternal supporters (and other Open Beta supporters) should have all been emailed your redemption codes for physical goods from J!NX. It will have been sent to the email address for your account. If you haven’t seen your redemption code, or you are a closed beta supporter who has not received physical goods, please contact support@grindinggear.com

**0.11.4**

0.11.4 will include two or three supporter unique items. We have many more that are very close, so expect more upcoming.

Very soon, we're going to have the first unique that can only be created with a recipe. We'll be dropping hints as to how this item is forged at an undisclosed location in the near future, so keep your eyes peeled.

The point reward for month long races isn't that great for time invested so if you are looking for efficient race points, the month long is not the place for you.  That being said there are many aspects of the month long that I believe most people would enjoy (heres a quick list, feel free to add)

-Item Reset. This is probably the most enjoyable part of the long races for me.  Your character starts from scratch and many of the items you find are actual upgrades for your character.  This also changes the relative value of items and currencies promoting a lot of bartering.

-You get a new character! Have a new build you want to try out? The month long is a great way to level while also gaining race points, and giving you a chance to score some awesome prizes in the raffle. If your character lives you can continue playing in hardcore or play in softcore if you died but enjoyed the character.

-Always wanted to try out hardcore?  Playing in the month race is a great way to start, especially if you can convince a few friends to try it together.  The economy reset means you can get a bit more currency out of leveling by selling skill gems or items that would normally be worth little to nothing on the permanent leagues.

I know it's technically Thursday already for some of you, but I'd like to propose and promote a new weekly event for the PoE Subreddit:

**Wiki Wednesday!** - http://en.pathofexilewiki.com

What's that, you ask? Well, a good wiki as a resource of accurate, quickly updated information is key to the success of an online game like Path of Exile. So I thought, why not have a weekly event where we remind everyone to read and contribute to the wiki. Additionally, we can pick out a specific article or area of the wiki that needs some love and try to improve it.

This week, I'd like to recommend the [Quest Rewards](http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Quest_Rewards) page for some attention. As new skill gems are added to the game (and eventually, new Acts and Quests), people are going to be looking to the Quest Rewards page to figure out what combination of Class and Quest will allow them to quickly pick up the gems they want or need. It's going to take a significant amount of effort to keep this page up-to-date.

How can you help? As you level up a character, take a moment before claiming a quest reward to confirm that what you're getting matches what the wiki says. If it matches, that's great! No further effort required. But if it doesn't match, please do log into the wiki and edit in the correct information. It's easy to make an account and edit stuff yourself. If you're *really* scared about editing a wiki or screwing something up, then you could at least post in this thread or in a new Reddit thread to let someone else know what needs to be changed or cleaned up.

I'd love to hear the community's thoughts on this event and the current state of the wiki. Recommendations for particular wiki pages/sections to focus on improving in the future would be great, as well as ideas for articles and information you'd like to see covered that isn't there already. And feedback on the idea of Wiki Wednesday as a weekly event would be appreciated as well! I haven't decided yet if I want to cross-post this to the official forums yet or if we want to keep this a Reddit thing.

**TL;DR: Let's pick a page/section of the unofficial wiki each week to update and make sure is as correct and complete as possible, so we have an awesome wiki to help promote the game and community.**

Good luck out there, fellow exiles. **May your ping be low, and your framerate high!**

Every patch that buffs melees so far is mostly just buffing our damage output, but actually melee damage is pretty good where it's at. Our problem is surviving. 

Take the cyclone release for example , a cool skill , very many hits so good life on hit. 

But this whole skill is countered by lightning thorns , a mod that just breaks cyclone by almost insta killing even the tankiest character who uses cyclone.

Also , since they nerfed the life on hit on multi-target spells , I feel like it's even worse for me, being a cleaver. Ok my damage went up a lot , but this only makes reflect hit for more, and my life on hit is reduced.

After playing a ranger dual wielder myself since open beta release,  I can safely say we melees jus't cant do as many map mods as ranged, and the problem isn't our damage output, it's having to facetank all the mobs.

Possible solution : Add a few damage reduction points to melee physical nodes. Any other place would again benefit the ranged characters.

Another solution : change the 20% max health lifesteal cap to 30% 

Does anyone else have some solutions?

Thanks for reading through this and I hope we can get the discussion going, I really love this game but after seeing some streams I feel that I should just reroll to lightning arrow and everything would be much easier.

Rules below!

To qualify to win a beta key, show me some skill tree ingenuity!  After 24 hours, the most interesting/my favorite build wins!  If two or three are similarly epic I will gift a beta key to each of them!

The build can be one of three level ranges:

Early game, no more then 40 points spent.
Mid game, no more then 80 points spent.
End game, all 111 points allowed.

Feel free to post any questions for clarification as well!

Edit:Spelling
Edit2:This is a self post, i get no karma, just to prevent the contestants from downvoting to limit the visibility, if this post does not hit 50 upvotes no beta key will be given.  Make it fair guys.

Edit3: Sorry about saying 50, I wasnt aware of the average upvote on the frontpage here, 16 is plenty and the prizes will definitely go out!

Edit4: Sleep now, winner/s picked in the morning!  Remember anyhthing posted after the 24 hour mark isnt eligible!

Edit5: Thank you everyone for the ideas provided, I hope it has helped more then just myself in expanding how we see the skill tree.  The winner of the Beta Key is TradeMe, for the Elemental Templar Build!

Honorable mentions: GotWiserDude, DLimited, dworgi, FestiveFruitcake

I rolled on random.org to pick between the honorable mentions for a second beta key!  Winner is GotWiserDude!

I will be sending you each your beta key shortly, thanks again everyone!

Currently all white map drops function this way, but if they roll magic, rare or unique they are assigned to a random player?!!?

I do not understand the reasoning behind the game giving away maps to the group because they happened to roll blue.

Chris Wilson please!

Edit: To those who do not run their own maps for public groups: Imagine you  are providing charity in this manner and a 72 maps drops blue and some guy takes it. Now imagine this happening on a frequent basis. If these people want higher level maps they should build their own pool and get there. They dont deserve to get free lvl 72+ maps for nothing.

Edit again: I don't care if i'm running a level 71 map and some guy gets a blue 66-67 map. By all means keep it. The problem is when equal level and higher level maps get taken. This prevents the group leader from sustaining the map pool that he has earned.

Selling items with 3-linked Blue, Green, and Red sockets will give you a Chromatic Orb. These will start to show up a lot more often entering Cruel difficulty.

Check out http://en.pathofexilewiki.com/wiki/Vendor_Recipes to find recipes to get Alchemy Shard/Orbs.

The easiest way (although it gets expensive) to get Alchemy Shards is to pick up flasks and use Transmutation Orbs and Alteration Orbs to make them ""Surgeon's"", which then sells for Alchemy Shards.

I have had many problems(like most people) selling things on the forums. However, i recently discovered a wonderful tool to help me sell. It worked! I am selling things now like never before, just from listing buy outs that the index sites can find.

How to do this is simple. Instead of using [spoiler]&lt;insert items here&gt;[/spoiler] use [spoiler=""~b/o 1 chaos""]&lt;insert item here&gt;[/spoiler]                                                                                                                                                                               With this, the index sites will pick up the buyout price and list it with your item. Currency the website uses are Alchemy orb: alch

Chaos orb: chaos

Gemcutter's Prism: gcp

Exalted orb: exa                                                                                                                   It helped me, can it help you too? try it and see :)",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,hardcore,True,t3_1hqc56,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1hqc56/psa_how_to_increase_your_shop_sales_with_buy_out/,

Please let us know when this happens, or manually let us choose channel without changing zone. 

Side note, I constantly mull over ideas to improve trade in game and keep coming up with shops. Back in some older mmos you could set up a little shop thing and put items in and have buyouts on items. Players walk through a bazaar type area and you can browse player's wares and buyout items there. Its not like an auction house, just people setting up shop like they do on the forum. GGG can do micros on these with shop item space and shop time as well as banners etc. could be fun. but that was a side note",,False,self,t5_2sf6m,False,,,True,t3_1aq1cb,http://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/1aq1cb/quality_of_life_trading_in_game_let_us_know_what/,
