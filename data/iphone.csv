1353242873.0,2638,self.iphone,13eafm,All iPhone tricks in one posting,painintheass21,3468,830,256,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/13eafm/all_iphone_tricks_in_one_posting/,"&gt;We are coming from: http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/13cv4k/what_is_the_least_commonly_known_iphone_tiptrick/#

1. Tapping comments and stories in Alien Blue with 2 fingers gives up votes, 3 fingers give downvotes. 

2. Another AlienBlue tip: Two finger swipe from left to right on a comment will give you that comment's full thread of replies. 

3. Tapping ""123"" then tapping the character you want then finally clicking back to the main keyboard can be a hassle. Instead hold down ""123"", slide thumb to character you want to use then let go. The character will be inputted and your keyboard will be back to normal.

4. Tapping the clock/top bar on a page will take you quickly to the top.

5. Tap chunk of text w/ 2 fingers to highlight the whole thing. Works only when commenting/editing etc.

6. **Be careful, actually there is no proofed solution to turn this off again!**
If you go into the phone app, and dial \*3001#12345#*
and hit call, the ""Field Test"" application opens, which allows you to see the numerical value of your cellular reception, along with other information about the surrounding cell towers. In addition, if you hold down the power button until the ""Slide to power down"" slider comes up and then hold down the home button until the app exits, you can tap on the carrier name in the top left corner to change between the numerical value and the visual representation (in bars) without going into ""Field Test"" mode. 
&gt;The values are always negative. In my experience, around -50 is pretty much the best reception possible, while about -120 is the lowest you can go without losing reception.
Anything above -80 is good, and would be considered full bars
Anything below -100 is bad, and would be considered few bars

7. Double click the upper case arrow to set caps lock

8. Force close a single app by holding the power button until the slide to power off slider appears, then press and hold the home screen button. It will close any app that you are in and also remove it from the RAM, forcing it to completely reload upon re-opening. Fixes many problems. 

9. This may have been obvious but you can zoom in and out in the default Camera app by using two fingers to pinch and spread.

10. You can use more than a 4 digit PIN number. By turning off ""Simple Password"" and choosing only numbers instead and NO letters. You will get a number keypad to unlock the phone instead of a full keyboard. And you can use as many numbers as you would like and you you have to press OK to enter it. This makes your PIN number much much harder to guess. Since you would need to not only guess the number but also how many digits the pin contains to break in.

11. Swipe away banner notifications that inhibit you pressing a button on the top of the screen by swiping from RIGHT TO LEFT (will not work L TO R).

12. In Mail, holding the ""New Email"" button will display all your recent drafts. 

13. Tapping the screen with two fingers while in Maps will zoom out

14. Add a shortcut for your email address (example @@). It makes filling in online forms much, much easier. 
&gt;Settings &gt; general &gt; keyboard &gt; shortcuts

15. Put a tracking number for UPS or some other mail services in a text field (notes, e-mail, text) and it becomes a link to the tracking website. 

16. To continue listening to a video or music video from safari after exiting safari, just double click the home button, go to music controls, and press play. Also works on the lock screen, useful for music videos, etc. 

17. A lot of people didn't notice the Emoji inclusion in iOS6. Under General-&gt;International-&gt;Keyboards-&gt;Add new keyboard. Then when you're sending a text, there is a new button that appears that let's you switch between keyboard layouts, so pop into the Emoji keyboard to add those silly things, and hit the keyboard button to switch back to a regular keyboard.

18. Sleep Timer - While playing music in the Music App , toggle to the clock app click timer, click ""when timer ends"", scroll to bottom, click stop playing. Start Timer.

19. Pressing the volume buttons when alarm clock goes off for the snooze. I've caught myself accidentally turning it off instead of pressing the snooze button and find this method much safer and easier.

20. If you turn on accessibility settings you can tap out a custom vibration pattern or make the bright camera LED flash when you get a call or text. Then go into contacts, hit Edit and you can select the vibration below the ring tone. On IOS6, the custom vibration settings have moved to Settings &gt; Sounds. You click on each individual alert type and you have to option to set a custom vibration.

21. If you're getting a call you can just press the lock button to mute it instead of pressing decline. Pretty useful for when your phone starts blasting in your pocket during a class or meeting! Works also with the volume keys.

22. Holding the keyboard globe icon gives you a list of keyboards that are on.

23. Swipe from leftmost of screen to right in camera to access the camera roll instead of clicking it from the bottom. 

24. In camera app, use the volume buttons as a picture clicker.

25. Press the home button and lock button to take a screenshot

26. To reset the new message counter. Lets say you have a bunch of unread emails and you don't want to click through all of them. Click edit, select the first message, hold down the Mark button and click the same message to unselect it. Voila! All the messages are selected! Click Mark as unread.

27. When websites have embedded content that scrolls (like an extra area with scrollbars), you can use 2 fingers to navigate through it. This works with textareas for example.

28. When your is screen off or the phone is locked while listening to music or just audio in general: Double Tap home button to bring up iPod controls to Pause/Stop or skip. Also works to resume last playing audio track whether native or 3 party. 

29. You don't have to swipe the homescreen to go to the next, you can simply tap the left corner/right corner right above the first and forth icons on the dashboard. See screenies: http://i.imgur.com/zNR0M.png

30. Here's for the lazy ones: end a phone conversation by pressing the lock button. This way, you can terminate the call and locking the screen in one press. 

31. If you want to search for a word on a page with safari, enter it in the web search box on the top right and scroll all the way down, past the suggestions until it says 'on this page'. 

32. You can use rich text styling in the mail app. Select some text and bring up the context menu, then press the arrow right. You can use bold, italics, underline, and indenting.

33. *#06# displays your iPhone's IMEI. Good to take down if you don't have the original box around you. You'll need the IMEI if your phone gets stolen or dislocated, in order to file a report with the police and/or a claim with the insurance company.

...where I gave away 3 iPhone cases to [lucky redditors.](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/wxw40/i_was_one_of_the_winners_of_the_twig_cases_the/) 

Well, with the new iPhone on the horizon, we've put everything on sale, and I've juiced it a bit for Reddit. 

**If this post gets over 100 upvotes, I'll give out a free custom case to someone who posts in this thread.** 

...or one of your choice, if that's how you fly. Slammo.

Check us out if you haven't yet : www.twigcase.com - the best bamboo iPhone cases out there!

We'll be rockin' a new case for the new iPhone when it comes out, so stay tuned!

**EDIT: Ermahgerd. That was fast. 100! I'm gonna randomly pick on Monday, but if this hits 500, I will hand out 2 more customs to lucky posters here. I don't even get to keep all this delicious karma D:**

EDIT2: omg. I know why Obama only answered 10 questions. Reddit is unrelenting. I have upvoted every last one of you and will continue to do so tomorrow. TIL what redditors post when they think no one is looking. Please check out our [Facebooks](http://www.facebook.com/TwigCaseCo) as every like makes my mom a tiny bit more proud. 

Edit3: ya did it! You guys are awesome! I'll pick the 3 winners at midnight Monday (cst), so if you're just getting here, post away until then. 

Also, want to shout to my pals Grow Anthology - they make longboards out of the same stuff our cases are made of : http://www.growanthology.com/ 

That should tell you a bit about how strong our cases are :)

it's coming soon - please check our [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/TwigCaseCo) page for super up to the minute updates.

Thanks again reddit! It's been fun. [We'll be back with more giveaways soon!](http://imgur.com/gallery/4SPfR)

**EDIT5: Some people were asking how durable a Twig Case Co. iPhone case is. [Here's our video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NR9-xMpWaOU) TL;DW: It's pretty damn tough.**

STILL EDITING6: 9-14-12 -  Two redditors should be receiving their cases early next week. The third one can't make up their damn mind! 	(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Also, we've announced [preorders for our iPhone 5 case,] (http://www.twigcase.com/collections/featured/products/iphone-5-case) and should have a swell new thing soon, which I'm sure I'll have to tell someone about. Because of the swellness.

**EDITRED7: We just updated our packaging to use less material, and it turns into a foldable charging and viewing stand. Now shipping with every case! http://imgur.com/a/wSNo8#0**


EDIT8: 10/27/12  - Shipping iPhone 5 cases next week, which means pre-orders will be over. Still working on that swell new thing. Thanks everyone for checking us out - we really appreciate it.

I'm the developer of the app, and I just submitted an update that would automatically add medical and chemistry terms (over 250,000 technical words), and for some reason that threw up a red flag, they rejected it, and they now deem the current app as being in violation of the developer guidelines. I bought myself an extra couple days of time by appealing it, but I was assured by an apple rep that the app will be pulled upon further review on Monday.

After every launch, the entire internet starts up a hate storm about how they were disappointed by the announcement. Macrumors, Reddit, 9to5mac, The Verge, Engadget, Twitter, Facebook. Every website has comment streams flooded with messages about how the Lumia is so much superior, or how the iPhone 5 wasn't radical enough or how Apple has barely caught up with Android. Here's my opinions the iPhone 5's ""missing"" features.

* NFC

I currently own a Galaxy Nexus. Know how many times I've used NFC to share stuff with friends or pay for something with Google Wallet? None. Including technology that isn't widely supported into your flagship phone doesn't make sense. Why add weight and thickness if the extras aren't even widely supported? ​

* Wireless Charging

Again, the same argument: it comes down to adding extra weight and thickness for supporting technology absent in the real world​. The Lumia weighs 183 grams vs 112 grams for the iPhone 5 vs 135 grams for the Galaxy Nexus. adding that much extra weight just to support an accessory? Ridiculous.

* Screen Size

Before the 4"" debut, 3.5"" was too big. After? Apple needed to go bigger. My Nexus measures at 4.65"". I have to use two hands just to send a small text message. I can't unlock the screen if its password protected. I can't even browse Reddit properly because the screen size is too big. Is 3.5"" too small? Certainly. But going bigger than 4-4.2""​ would seem like overkill. I was the fan of the Nexus S and was actually saddened when I saw the Galaxy Nexus at 4.65"". It's too big to use with one hand or to fit in your pocket.

* Lightning Connector

Ever tried plugging in a Micro-USB or a 30-pin dock connector in the middle of the night before going to sleep and after turning off the light? It's not fun. Hell, sometimes I have to turn on the light just to see how the damn connector fits in to my Nexus. People are actually mad that Apple introduced a smaller cable with a reversible cable and not using Micro USB. ​Until I see that this cable is actually a hindrance rather than a help, I wouldn't make up my mind saying that Apple screwed the pooch.

* Radical Redesign

It's easy to do radical designs when discovering the best shape but there's no reason to keep launching new designs when you hit the gold mine. The consumers love the design and are willing to spend money for it. Why change it now? Sure, in the R&amp;D stage, experiment away, but don't try it out on your flagship phone. Apple doesn't have 400 different smartphones in the market like Samsung. They keep it simple and elegant.

* Conclusion

There's no point in adding a new feature unless it directly benefits the consumer. Just by adding random ideas that you can think of into your flagship phone doesn't make it the best phone in the world. Just because you can watch a video while typing a text message, doesn't mean it's revolutionary. Just because you can wirelessly charge the phone using a dock that plugs into the wall doesn't make it mind-blowing. ​

For me (A Galaxy Nexus user) the things I bitch about are the fact that Apple's ecosystem is too closed​ (No defaulting of 3rd Party Apps or inclusion of apps like the barebones stocks app or the Newsstand folder which you can't delete). As for Windows Phone fans, well, we can discuss your issues when your phone AND OS actually launches.",,False,self,t5_2qh2b,False,,,True,t3_zubft,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/zubft/my_opinion_on_iphone_5s_missing_features/,

1362137215.0,432,self.iphone,19ghmp,A few lesser known settings that may improve your battery life (iOS 6),phuzybuny,490,58,64,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/19ghmp/a_few_lesser_known_settings_that_may_improve_your/,"These are some settings that I have found to have helped with my battery life on my iPhone 4S running iOS 6.1.2. These settings may not necessarily be for everyone but, hopefully, they can be of help to others with similar battery issues that the standard battery drain guides cannot resolve. 

**Disable unnecessary Notification Centre (NC) widgets.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Notifications -&gt; Edit*: drag unnecessary widgets out of the 'In Notification Centre' list and into the 'Not In Notification Centre' list.

* Why: Widgets such as Calendar and Mail will frequently pull information to keep 'updated'. The fewer widgets you have, the better.

* Why Not: You are in need of constant updates from all these applications (apps).

 
**Disable 'Emergency Alerts'.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Notifications*: toggle 'Emergency Alerts' to OFF.

* Why: Essentially a form of [push notification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Push_Notification_Service) that has a constantly open IP connection. 

* Why Not: You require or would like to have these notifications from your service provider.

 
**Disable Siri's 'Raise to Speak'.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Siri*: toggle 'Raise to Speak' to OFF.

* Why: The raise to speak function utilizes the infrared proximity sensor to constantly check how close a surface is to the face of the phone, as well as the iPhone's accelerometers.

* Why Not: You are a frequent user of Siri and its 'Raise to Speak' feature.

 
**Disable Mobile Data/Cellular for iTunes, FaceTime, Passbook Updates, and Reading List.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Mobile Data (or 'Cellular')*: under 'Use Mobile Data for:' list, toggle 'iTunes', 'FaceTime', 'Passbook Updates', and 'Reading List' to OFF.

* Why: Your mobile data will be used for these apps or features and whenever they update in the background.

* Why Not: You require these apps to have mobile data access (as opposed to wifi).

 
**Disable automatic time zone setting.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; Date &amp; Time*: toggle 'Set Automatically' to OFF.

* Why: Location services will be used to check your position on a regular basis in order to adjust the time according to the time zone you are in.

* Why Not: You frequently change time zones or require this feature.

 
**Disable unnecessary System Services that require Location Services.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Location Services -&gt; System Services* (Note: System services can only be accessed when Location Services is toggled ON): toggle any of these system services that you do not require to OFF (personally, I have left only Compass Calibration on).

* Why: These system services are not essential to the phone's basic functions but utilize Location Services which can be a strong battery drain.

* Why Not: You require or utilize these system services.


**Disable Diagnostics &amp; Usage reporting.**

* How: *Settings -&gt; General -&gt; About -&gt; Diagnostics &amp; Usage*: select 'Don't Send'.

* Why: Whenever a crash or error report is generated, the log is automatically sent to Apple in order to help address the issue in future iOS updates, using mobile data and Location Services.

* Why Not: You wish to help Apple address crashes or instabilities in iOS.",,False,self,t5_2qh2b,1362187110.0,,4S,True,t3_19ghmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/19ghmp/a_few_lesser_known_settings_that_may_improve_your/,

Forwards to +1XXXXXXXXXX Enabled (the 1XXXXXXXXXX is an actual number...write that number down, you'll need it).

Then dial \*61\*+1XXXXXXXXXX\*11\*tt# Of course use the number you wrote down instead of the Xs. You'll need the plus sign too...hold down 0.  Instead of ""tt"" put in the amount of time you want your phone to ring for with a max of 40 seconds I believe, then press send. For example, I keyed in \*61\*+18324219997\*11\*30#

Your phone will now ring longer before going to voicemail.

I thought you might be interested in my journey from someone who literally knows **nothing** about programming to a published game developer. I know that this type of post would have been really helpful for me when was just getting started. Hopefully I can inspire someone in a similar situation!

**THE STORY**

About a year and a half ago, I decided that I wanted to make a game. There was a problem though. A big problem: **I hadn’t programmed a day in my life.**

I always thought it would be pretty sweet to be a game developer but it was so out of reach that it never felt like a realistic goal. But one day in October of 2010 I just decided to go for it. I had nothing to lose so why not?

I learned bits and pieces of a bunch of languages, including C, Python, ActionScript, and Objective-C. Honestly though, I really don’t think it matters too much what languages you learn on. If there is one piece of advice that I can share about learning to program, it is this: **PROGRAM A LOT**. There really is no other way to learn besides doing, doing, doing, doing, and doing again. Every time you make something new, you find a thousand things that you did wrong before. Every time, you chisel away at your horrible programming skills until you’re finally able to make something that you can be proud of.

Along the way I made a ton of stupid, fun, and weird mini-games to help me learn. I made:

* [A game about a man-rodent](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/dtplj/thought_you_might_be_interested_in_my_very_first/) hiding in a town, attacking the townspeople
* [A text-based minesweeper clone]( http://youtu.be/Cn_Oibc4sjg) with a custom-sized board and mine-count
* [A game called Pizza Guy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HLumD97DX8), about a guy who had to (you guessed it) deliver a pizza while trying to jump over an endless barrage of pipes of varying heights. The only result was loss. There was no win.
* [A game called Party Man](http://www.whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/1000000423.png), in which the the protagonist is driving along a grid, trying to reach a party. The problem was that my programming was still pretty bad at that point, so he kept literally crashing the party.
* [An app where you could create sequences of musical phrases](http://youtu.be/xWMsBGEwvbY) in the pentatonic scale
* [A flash clone of the classic snake game](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)
* [A flash clone of those driving-through-an-ever-shrinking-tunnel games](http://whitakerblackall.com/wp-content/uploads/Racer.swf)

Finally, I decided it was time to make a real game. Pretty much all of Polymer’s creation was iterative design. I never had an overall plan. I kept thinking, “I don’t know how to make a complete game. I just know how to make basic gameplay,” as if there were one way to make a game. But I realized I just need to make it however I could, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right or best way.

When I sent the game to beta testers, I was convinced that all I really needed to do was polish it up a bit. Oh man was I wrong. I had so many amazing suggestions from my testers that I just had to implement. I probably said, “I’ve only got one or two more things to add, then I’m done!” a thousand times.

Submitting to the app store was terrifying. I was so paranoid that I would forget something huge. Something that could break the game or get it rejected. But at the same time, it felt amazing. I finally did it. My creation, my baby, was done. I went from not knowing a thing about programming to finishing a game that I was very very proud of.

It’s already gotten some awesome previews on [Touch Arcade](http://toucharcade.com/2012/04/19/hands-on-with-whitaker-trebellas-polymer/), [Indie Game Mag](http://mobile.indiegamemag.com/looking-shapely-polymer-teaser-trailer/) and [Gamezebo](http://www.gamezebo.com/games/polymer/preview).

Of course, I hope Polymer sells well. But even if it doesn’t, I’m proud of myself for actually carrying this whole dream through. I’ve had trouble in the past making the journey from start to finish on big projects. Starting is easy. Finishing isn’t. Plus, programming Polymer has taught me so many amazing things. There’s a lot of really messy spaghetti code, but I honestly don’t care too much because it works. Next time I make a game I’ll be able to build upon what I’ve learned, and hopefully make something even more awesome. Until then though, I’m hoping for the best with Polymer. And I hope you enjoy it!

**TLDR:**

* A year and a half ago, I had no clue how to program

* Today my first game, Polymer, was released to the iTunes app store

* I did all the programming, music, and art

* It's 50% off for launch!

1286899581.0,378,self.iphone,dq8pz,"Dear Reddit, with your help, my iPhone game can overtake Angry Birds. For real. Also, AMA.",MattRix,485,107,431,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/dq8pz/dear_reddit_with_your_help_my_iphone_game_can/,"I spent a year working on a game in my spare time and released it back in June. For 4 months, I had very low sales, but amazing user feedback. Two weeks ago, I made a last ditch effort to create some buzz. I decided to release the most generous lite version I could. Rather than include a couple levels like most lite versions, I included 60 brand new levels. 

A prominent Italian site tried the lite version, gave it a great review, and it almost instantly rose to the top of the Italian free chart. The buzz had finally been created. A couple days later, I got an email from Apple saying they wanted to do an App Store feature of the paid version of the game. Apple featured the game last Thursday, and since then, it's been climbing the paid app charts in every country. It currently sits at **#13 in the UK** and **#48 in the US**. This is awesome, but after the feature is over, the game will drop back off the charts unless it gets into the top 5 or 10 apps. I seriously believe this game has the potential to make the top 5 and sustain it's position there.

I think this is my one big chance to literally change my life. The paid game is called Trainyard and the lite version is Trainyard Express. The price of the game was $2.99, but **I put it on sale for 99 cents right before making this post**. The sale will last for a couple days until the game stops being featured. I'd LOVE it if you'd buy the game and tell your friends about the sale. 

I am planning on being completely transparent and honest with how this sale goes, no matter whether it fails or succeeds. I'll post hourly updates with graphs of the rank and how it has changed. Consider this an AMA as well.  

If you're not sure if the game is for you, please try Trainyard Express or just browse some of the App Store reviews, and I think you'll find that it's a pretty solid game. 


**TL:DR;** My iPhone game is on sale for 99 cents, if you buy it, I will love you forever.

Hi everyone,

Following up from last week's [Alien Blue HD announcement](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/ddw3u/alien_blue_hd_for_the_ipad_is_now_available_on/), I want to introduce the next major release of Alien Blue for the iPhone.


** Why is this a major release? **
----------------------

* A new icon
* A revised user interface
* Comment themes
* Lots of features

There's a lot of information that follows, so you may want to skim through:


** Some caveats **
----------------------

* iOS 4.2 has recently been seeded to developers, and I'm working on reducing any impact this will have on you prior to the iOS public release.

* 3 Critical memory leaks were plugged.  Although I've done my best to keep the app stable, fixing memory leaks can sometimes cause crashes.  So if the app does crash on you, **please let me know** so that I can investigate it.



** Comment Themes **
----------------------

Along with it's new user interface, Alien Blue now has three in-built comment skins:

1. Minimalist (looks like iReddit/Reddit.com)
2. Boxed (closer to Mobile Reddit)
3. Classic

On fresh installs, the app will now use the Minimalist/Reddit theme to make new users feel at home.  For existing installs, you can easily switch via:

** Settings -&gt; Comment Settings -&gt; Comment Display Skin **


** New Features **
----------------------

* Simplified &amp; More Native User Interface 
* Back / Forward in Web Browser
* Subscribe &amp; Unsubscribe from Reddits through Alien Blue
* **Orangered Envelope**
* Save to Reddit Option (directly from the browser)
* Save to Photos (directly from the browser)
* Added ""Always Use Instapaper Mobilizer"" under Advanced Settings
* Support for **voting arrows** when listing Posts
* Support for voting arrows when listing Comments
* High-Resolution switch to view comics / text heavy images (from the browser actions)
* Comment Themes
* ""Comments to Fetch"" setting, supports 200, 500 or 1,000 (Reddit Gold subscribers)
* Introduced ""News &amp; Updates"" section
* New Icon (thanks to Jedberg, KeyserSosa and Reddit's licensing department)


** Fixes and Improvements **
----------------------

* Critical : Low quality / blurry images showing in the browser view
* Critical : Fixed AB losing scroll position when low on memory
* Critical : Patched 3 heavy memory leaks (would cause the app to bloat, slow down and/or crash after a short time)
* Critical : Refreshes Reddit API authentication token when expired
* Critical : Show All Images occasionally caused a crash
* Fixed: Missing Subreddits bug (when subscribed to more than 50 subreddits)
* Fixed: Multiple links from messages were browsing to the first link.
* Fixed: Keyboard overlapping camera controls for Imgur uploads
* Fixed: ""Save Image"" activating when tapping ""Cancel"" on browser action sheet
* Fixed: In-App Email / Bug Reporting rotating in Upside-Down Portrait
* Fixed: Empty Subreddit title when restoring from state (3.x devices)
* Fixed: Truncation of author names in deeper threads
* Moved ""Dismiss"" button to the top of the screen when presenting connection errors (as keyboard could occasionally cover it)
* Rounded corners of Subreddit logos
* Full-screen now available in Reddit Selector
* Added a Help button (top left in Settings)
* Improved differentiation of visited links in night-mode
* Fixed ultra-thin ""Hide"" glyph for Retina displays
* Photo &amp; Camera controls now hide in Landscape (as these are only supported in Portrait)
* Reduced opacity of full-screen back and exit icons
* Removed circular links to self posts
* Network activity indicator in the Status Bar now shows connection activity
* Improved handling of connection errors
* Improved ""Save State"" for 3.x devices

Check it out, and please keep me posted with any bugs that you come across.  I love to squish 'dem bugs.



** Next Update (v2.1 - Coming Very Soon) ** : 
----------------------

Mark-down (bold, italic, inline links and improved comment formatting)
----------------------

I've just finished writing up a lightweight [markdown engine](http://www.reddit.com/r/AlienBlue/comments/dg6nk/alien_blue_markup_support_is_in_development/) for CoreText (so that Reddit comments can be rendered very quickly on your device).

This means:

* Inline links (with optional footnoted buttons if you like those)
* Indented and correctly formatted quotes
* Support for Bold and Italic

For those with fat fingers, don't worry: the inline links are very forgiving and Alien Blue will check areas surrounding your touch to see if a link is in the vicinity.  I will be submitting v2.1 for approval very shortly, and mark-down support will be included.

This is my first app in the App Store that I've written completely on my own during my free time. I have no concrete plans for it (other than that it will remain completely free and ad-free). I only want people to have fun with it!

**Anyways, I'd love some feedback from reddit on how I can make it better.** What do you like about it? What parts do you hate? I'm super open to implementing your ideas and suggestions. Thanks!

**EDIT: Thanks for the kind words, everyone! You are seriously awesome. Based on the feedback thus far, here's some things I need to do in the next release:**

* Edit button to re-record Animotions without having to delete/re-create
* Don't cover part of the Animotion with the title at the bottom
* Make it easier to delete un-recorded Animotions
* Ability to simply copy an Animotion to the clipboard
* Bugfix: Animotion titles at the bottom are covered by the keyboard when editing
* Transferring Animotions to other devices (for people with iPhone, iPad, etc.)
* Adding text to Animotions!
* Save Animotions to camera roll
* Import video and convert to Animotion

EDIT (5/22/13 @ 3:06AM PST): Holy crap, you guys/gals got Animotions to rank #233 of 300 on the top free Photo &amp; Video apps! I love you all! I'm going to sleep now, but I'll check back again tomorrow to answer any more questions / suggestions you might have. Thanks again!

EDIT (5/22/13 @ 11:22AM PST): Wow, r/iphone, you made it climb 100 spots overnight! This is seriously incredible. I'll be checking the thread throughout the day to answer any more questions :)

EDIT (5/23/13 @ 10:51AM PST): Well, I'm still here and checking the thread!

This is not simply a retooling of the classic email client.  The following is taken directly from the Mailbox [privacy policy](http://www.mailboxapp.com/privacy/);  
      
*****
 
For starters, you will no longer have a direct, secure link between yourself and your email service, as Mailbox requires your email to be passed through their own servers. All of it;
&gt;  Mailbox is designed to help you manage your email account with other providers, like Gmail. When you link your email accounts (provided by third parties) to Mailbox, you give Mailbox permission to securely access your information contained in or associated with those accounts.  

***** 

One red-flag is that they make no assurances as to what will happen to your information if their service is bought by someone else;  
&gt; The assurances in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information if/when it’s transferred to a new entity. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information, as well as any choices you **may have** regarding your personal information.
    
(emphasis mine)  The wording is pleasant, but take into consideration that they *could* just promise that, in the event the service were to be sold, you would be given the option to prevent the transfer of your data to the new ownership entity.
So the real question is what they intend to do with your data.  

*****

A second red flag might be this line;  
&gt; We will never share, rent or sell your information to third parties outside Orchestra and its group companies (including subsidiaries and affiliates) without your consent, except as noted below...
    
The term ""affiliates"" makes this claim rather vague, as any company at any time could become affiliated with Orchestra, Inc.  

*****

&gt; If you link your third party account to Mailbox, that third party may also pass certain information along about your use of its service.  
    
... I'm not sure what this one even means.  Is Google going to send Orchestra, Inc. information about my Google services usage?  Why?  
    
*****
*****
    
    
edit:  made the formatting *slightly* less horrible

edit 2:  As it may not be obvious to the average user, **deleting this app will not stop the service from grabbing your email**.  Their services will continue to consume your messages until you go back to Google and de-authorize their access.

I've had AT&amp;T + iPhones for the past 3 years. Never broken the 2GB limit. Now, I've broken the 2GB limit every month for the past 6 months and I haven't changed my habits at all. What made me suspect that AT&amp;T was bs-ing their numbers was that on two separate occasions, I've received conflicting numbers.

One day, around 8am, I received a text from AT&amp;T saying I had used 65% of my 2GB. Ok, fine, whatever. 3pm later that same day, I received another text from AT&amp;T saying that I had exceeded my 2GB limit and was now incurring charges. Mind you, during this 7 hours, I was busy at work and only texted and got on facebook a few times.

This month, I got a text at 2pm saying I was incurring charges but never received a warning text as I usually would. So, I logged into att at around 3pm and checked my usage. The website read: ""This usage data is current as of 3:34am today"". This would be able 10.5 hours prior and it said I had only used 1400mb. Again, this would mean I used 600+mb in 10.5 hours between sleeping &amp; working.

Chatted an AT&amp;T rep and he said ""You have an iPhone 5 and it's faster - therefore you use more data"" which makes absolutely no sense.

So, my iPhone is jailbroken so I downloaded a jailbreak app called 'Usage monitor' that tracks every bit of data going in/out of my iphone using cellular data. At the end of the month, I'll compare what I have to what they have. 


Has anyone else noticed this?

So over at /r/apple, [Positronic_Matrix](http://www.reddit.com/user/Positronic_Matrix) recently revamped the CSS for the subreddit.

One of the modifications was an ever-present image of Steve Jobs (it's changed many times since then; the first one was quite obnoxious) in the right sidebar. I and many other readers thought this was excessive, so another reader (not me), posted [Can we get rid of that picture of Steve from the sidebar? It's creepy. ](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/i31sv/can_we_get_rid_of_that_picture_of_steve_from_the/). It received an overwhelmingly positive response, with over 800 upvotes and an 81% liked ratio. The top comment, at 316 points, was to remove the picture entirely.

I decided to take matters into my own hands and write a GreaseMonkey script to remove the picture. I posted [Greasemonkey script to remove image on the right](http://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/i3na6/greasemonkey_script_to_remove_image_on_the_right/). Upon reading it, Positronic_Matrix left a sarcastic comment and immediately banned the link. When I inquired as to what had happened, he sent me an unapologetic response and banned the earlier 800-upvote submission.

Some excerpts from his messages:

&gt;I did ban it. The r/apple subreddit is for news and stories, not for endless complaints about photographs. I've decided to draw the line right now and here starting with your post.

&gt; To be fair, I also removed the other post complaining about the right picture that is out of date. I should have redirected from the beginning, however I was having fun. It set a bad precedent and opened the door for using the main page as a forum for complaints. That's definitely something I don't want to encourage. I apologize for my lack of discipline. :(

&gt;At this moment, I have made the decision to remove complaining from the front page regarding the layout and to be fair to you, I removed any other comment with similar content. No more trolling pictures (intentional or unintentional).

He is attempting to shunt all criticism to a [tiny thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/applehelp/comments/hxp2n/feedback_on_the_new_rapplehelp_layout_requested/) in a *different subreddit*, against the obvious wishes of the community who upvoted the original post 800 times. And of course, all *positive* feedback, which is also in violation of his ""all CSS stuff goes here"" policy, is left unbanned.

So yeah, am I the only one who thinks this is unacceptable for a moderator?

EDIT: To help, please [message the /r/apple moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23apple) asking them to unban the posts and tell Positronic_Matrix to apologize; there's 3 above him ([qgyh](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=qgyh2), [kn0thing](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=kn0thing), and [davidreiss666](http://www.reddit.com/user/davidreiss666])) that are capable of removing him if absolutely necessary.",,False,self,t5_2qh2b,True,,,True,t3_i3wcv,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/i3wcv/rapple_moderator_changes_css_bans_all_criticism/,

It is called meme design and here is the link: http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-design/id490532286?ls=1&amp;mt=8

**edit:I forgot to mention that there is also an ipad version of the app as well!**

 I need reddits feedback on it to help make it better.  The next version I plan on implementing:

many more meme templates (I realize a lot are missing right now)
*import from camera
*move text
*change text color

reddit, you suggest the ideas and I will implement them.  The ad will always be free.  The only plans for the future is to use this app (if it gets popular enough) to promote a website version of it which will have some (non intrusive) ads.

**Suggestions that will be implemented so far: 

* sort templates abc order and have a tab for the most popular meme's

* search templates

* Save created meme's in app

* Share feature send in txt message

* When sharing to reddit, chose which subreddit

* copy image to clipboard

I am not sure if I can be called a Redditor since I just read and upvote, downvote. I am a frequent lurker and fervent reader of the front page and the nosleep sub-reddit, they are my lullaby before I really shut my eyes for the day.

Today I received an e-mail from kickstarter saying they have approved my project: the RADIUS case for iPhone and I would love to share this project with the Reddit community and I would be honored to answer any questions you have about the project and my journey to get there. And of course, your pledge and support will be very very much needed and appreciated.

Short story: My sister (a stay at home mom) wanted to start a business, asked me if I can design an iPhone case for her so she can make it and sell and get some cash for her growing family (new baby girl). I start sketching and 6 months and many turn downs from CNC machinists later (they say the case is too expensive and not manufacture-able) we finally launch on kickstarter.com

The team is basically myself, my best friend and my sister. We don't have any experience in doing this, so you will see that the video presentation is not quite ""there"". I didn't sleep for a week when the video was shot, I had to drive 20 hours to be at my other teammate's house because he has the video equipment and the DSLR to shoot the prototypes. 

So please check the project on kickstarter out, if you have an iphone 5 and like it, please support us and pledge, if not please help spread the project to your colleague, friends, family!

As I said above, I would be happy to share my experience for the project and our journey to get it to kickstarter.

Upvotes, comments, all appreciated!

UPDATE:

I really appreciate all of the comments and feedback here! Thank you for the support and criticism and the pledges! I will try my best to get the testing video done and post it, it might take me a while because we are still adjusting the inner linings to have the best result. Thanks again everyone!

UPDATE 2:

Phone jack area photo:(note this is an early prototype, the fit and finish was in progress)
http://imgur.com/ZIPwo

UPDATE 3:

Hi all, I have been busy with all the e-mails and responses and have to take care of some personal matters. Also since the project is getting closer to reality, we start to look at packaging and other issues. I have to help with this because I am the only one that really have any idea about it. I also been in touch with my prototyper and 3M, the material company to see which material works best with low profile. With this thin design, it will obviously not have the protection that a conventional case would have. The meeting with them in next week, and I will start to do my own tests with various types of methods. Will keep you updated. Again, thanks for all the feedback and support, and also the criticism. It's all good, I am excited as heck and also anxious to be honest... 


UPDATE 4:

A big thank you, and heartfelt appreciation to all of the support from everyone here, and especially to the Redditors that like the case and backed us! You guys/gals are awesome! 
http://i.imgur.com/FkqVm.jpg (this is two weeks ago, recently we have gotten a few more)

I met with the manufacturer yesterday and we talked about all of the feedback I received here and other places. Most notable issues: 
1. The level of impact protection 
2. Scuffing due to the X frame
3. Comfort of the X frame
4. Keeping cost down

We will address all of those issues in a final master prototype, while keeping the idea the same. Minor improvements, making things better, stronger and different types of finishing to make things smoother. The change will have to be minor and does not affect the design/change the appearance much. The 3M materials have yet to arrive, I will make another update on that when I received it. 

Thanks again and please continue to help us spread the word. If you or anyone you know want to start a kickstarter project, feel free to ask anything or PM me, I will talk to you on the whole process we went through and any questions you have.

I went through three 920's and decided I couldn't deal any longer, cancelled my contract and got a 5 under my boyfriends account. Here are the mains reasons I had to come back:

•Lack of apps, interested developers, and support. 
•Microsoft boasts how awesome their live tiles are, but they themselves don't even bother to create many for their own native apps. 
•Purchased music from XBox music is nearly impossible to transfer between different devices. (Not to mention I had to navigate through pointless animations and apps to play said music.)
•There isn't anyway to purchase videos of any kind on the device. 
•Pandora and apps like it would eat up my data plan even when I had stopped them (this is a known bug and there is an app to kill all the music processes but a person shouldn't have to do that.)
•Microsoft's ""in-and-out"" philosophy is crap. If you missed a notification you would have to search your never ending start screen hoping the tile is actually working and showing the notification. 
•Many apps lack basic functionality. For instance, 98% of the apps that play videos do not allow you a slider to chose a specific time in the video. You have to fast forward, wait for it to buffer, and then fast forward again, hoping you don't pass up what you were looking for, thus having to rewind back. It's just a pain in the butt. Oh, and one very annoying feature, screen brightness has three options. None of which are very different from the other. 
•And lastly (for this list anyway, and aside from the many bugs and lack of support to fix these bugs), the battery.  A day of good use would lead to the phone dying by 6PM. They push this ""battery saver"" feature but there shouldn't even be a need for one, and if there is one it should work.

EDIT: Verge reports: Apple: YouTube app will not be included in iOS 6, Google working on standalone version

http://www.theverge.com/2012/8/6/3223775/apple-youtube-ios6

Apple's entire statement is below.

&gt;Our license to include the YouTube app in iOS has ended, customers can use YouTube in the Safari browser and Google is working on a new YouTube app to be on the App Store.

More Update:

Engadget has also heard from Apple and learned that while iOS 6 devices will lose the stock YouTube app, iOS 5 devices will not. It seems that either Google's licensing agreement permits it to stay on the older OS, Apple didn't want to go to the trouble to push out a point update that takes away a feature, or some combination of both.

http://www.engadget.com/2012/08/06/youtube-app-removed-from-ios-6-ios-5-confirmation-official/

UPDATE 2: from Engadget

&gt;*A YouTube spokesperson has provided us with the following quote: ""We are working with Apple to ensure we have the best possible YouTube experience for iOS users."" Not much to go on, really, but reassuring that the company's actively forging ahead with a new effort. Something tells us it'll take every opportunity to trumpet the awesomeness of its standalone app after being quietly pushed / left out of the latest iOS 6 beta.*

Also, the ability to upload video to YouTube from iOS 6 beta 4 is still present.

I was pretty excited for the upgrade, so when I realized I had to be in NYC for work (Comic Con -- it was nuts) the day it was being shipped I was maybe a little bummed. I had tried to reroute the shipment to my hotel, but that failed.

Luckily my girlfriend was around on Friday so she could at least sign for the package... that was until she got a Jury Summons earlier in the week and had to show up for the selection process that morning. She left a kind note to UPS stating she was serving jury duty and asked if he could leave the package behind. Because an in-person signature was required, he was unable to do so and left a note back saying he would make a second attempt on Monday before 10AM.

That evening, my girlfriend decided to take a trip to NYC to visit me and as she was walking out the door she hears the UPS truck roaring down the street. He pulls right up to the house and excitedly gets out and hands her the package from Apple. He said he was ""so glad to find you, I've driven down this street 3 or 4 times since my first attempt -- I figured your boyfriend would really want his delivery today instead of waiting for Monday!""

It's not often you hear a good story about a delivery driver, so I just thought I'd share. :)

Long story short, with the help of /r/iphone getting the word out, Trainyard was able to beat Angry Birds and become the #2 paid app on the App Store. 

A couple months after that crazy time, it fell back down the charts, so I set its price to $2.99, which it's stayed at for a long time. 

On Thursday, on a whim I decided to drop Trainyard's price back to 99c, and for some reason that created a lot of buzz and now it's climbing the charts again. I don't expect it to do nearly as well as back in 2010, but it's already up to #150 in games, so I figured that I might as well let you guys know because you were so awesome the first time :D

[Clicky!](http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/uxb3r/ios_6_beta_1_iphoneipad_screenshots/)

I figured it would be nice to make a thread to share some hidden features or features that weren't really talked about iOS 6 Beta at WWDC. Some things I noticed:

* Downloading an app no longer pushes you back to the home screen.
* An app that has been updated will get a blue ribbon overlaid in the corner that says ""New"" (similar to a newsstand app).
* In the app store if an app is already installed the button will say ""Open"" instead of ""Installed"" and pressing it will open the app on your phone.
* In iMessage you will be able to link your email address to a phone number.
* Music app has been changed to look more like the iPad Music app.
* iTunes/App Store apps have been changed.
* The status bar now is a light semi transparent color and the color changes based off of whatever color the navigation bar color of the app you are using is.
* iPad gets a really nice default clock app.
* You can choose to show an iMessage alert from everyone or just numbers/emails you have in your Contacts.app
* Bluetooth on/off toggle now directly at the top of the Settings.app next to Wifi toggle

Edit:  

* Photos.app now uses a Photo Stream tab to access your photo stream instead of doing it as an album.
* Share buttons now use a grid like way to select where you want to share (iMessage, email, twitter, facebook, etc) instead of popping up as a list.
* In the iPad Clock app the temperature of a city shows up in the World Clocks view in addition to the time in that city.

Edit #2:  

* Phone.app keypad is now a light colored theme instead of dark.
* Camera.app now has a dark bottom bar, along with a black shutter button.

Edit #3:  

* When Do Not Disturb is active a moon icon will appear next to the clock. You can also set a time to turn on/off the DND feature automatically and can allow/block repeated calls within 3 minutes to go through.

Edit #4:

* A lot more emoji icons!
* iPad Settings.app has a thicker gray bar between the ""categories"" of the settings on the left scrolling table.

Edit #5:  

* Weather.app has a slightly different font (less bold) and the blue background kind of has a glow/gradient.

Edit #6:  

* With the new Maps.app zooming out all the way will show a 3D Earth instead of a 2D map. (only for Satellite/Hybrid view)

Edit #7:

* In Clock.app you can pick a song in your iPod.app to be used as an alarm.

Edit #8:  

* Don't recall if this was mentioned but in Settings.app you can set a different signature for each mail account now.

Edit #9:  

* Lost mode of Find my iPhone: When this is enabled the default wallpaper changes to a lock icon and a phone number can be input that will be displayed in addition to a message. A user can tap a button and if the device is an iPhone it will call the phone number you chose. In addition you will be able to see a location trail of the device if it changing location.
* Find my iPhone now shows the battery state of a device (how full the battery is and whether it is plugged in or not).

Edit #10:  

* You can now adjust the speed required to activate Double and Triple-click Home from Default, Slow, and Slowest settings.

Edit #11:  

* Reminders.app When selecting a location for location based reminders you are no longer limited to locations in your address book. You can type a location manually.
* FindMyFriends.app You can have the phone notify a contact through a push notification automatically when you arrive or leave at a certain location. You no longer have to set up a reminder and then manually message them. I believe the caveat is that the other user has to have FindMyFriends.app installed on their phone as it goes as a push notification through that app.

Edit #12:  

* When a device is locked a lock icon no longer shows up in the status bar.

Edit #13:  

* Searching for an app in spotlight now also shows you the folder it is in.
* Adding a new tab in Safari.app will create it to the right of your current tab instead of all the way to the right.
* Mail.app allows attaching of photos/videos from within the application.
* The shutdown spinner indicator has been updated to retina quality.

Edit #14:  

* If you started push by turn navigation and moved to a different app you will receive a local banner as a notification when its time to make a turn.

Edit #15:  

* Formatting (bold, italics, underline) is available for email signatures.

Edit #16: Credit to [Corrie9](http://www.reddit.com/user/Corrie9)
&gt; * While listening to podcasts or audiobooks, the skip buttons on the lockscreen and multitasking bar will change to rewind 15sec/skip 15sec.
http://i.imgur.com/k2xc9.png

&gt; * The current date will be shown in notification center (only if there are upcomming events).
http://i.imgur.com/3hh9F.jpg

&gt; * Double tap on an date in the calendar will take you to the day view of that date

&gt; * With auto-brightness enabled, the brightness slider now represents the current brightness, is live updating. The setting you manually choose is the lowest it will go.

&gt; * In Setting -&gt; General -&gt; About, the Serial Number and Wi-Fi-Adress (and some other long values too) can be copied (tab and hold)

&gt; * The European volume limit is currently disabled, can be turned on and off in the music settings (button not working).
Music through headphones is much louder on european devices now.
http://i.imgur.com/ILlCh.png


&gt; * New EQ Setting: Late Night Mode. Reduces loudness by aprox. 50% allowing finer volume controll, may or may not reduce bass.
http://i.imgur.com/ehXq3.png

&gt; * Updating apps via the appstore does not require a password anymore

&gt; * Installing already purchased apps work without password too

&gt; * Remote Web Inspector through Desktop Safari
http://i.imgur.com/m10sw.png

Edit #16:  

* When searching for a song in iPod.app you can ""Continue search in store.""
* For iTunes match users there is no longer a cloud button to download a song, instead tapping the song will start playing it and download it to your phone.

Edit #17:  

* Reminders.app now can use badges
* You can now rearrange mailboxes in Mail.app",,False,self,t5_2qh2b,1339552704.0,,,True,t3_uwv5n,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/uwv5n/hidden_features_of_ios_6_beta/,

I just wanted to share that someone on the Apple Support Communities finally posted something that worked as a solution for me.  I don't know whether this will work for anyone (and it doesn't make a lot of sense to me that this even worked for me), but if anyone else has had the same problem, feel free to try it out and see if it works for you.

Here's the directions as they were presented to me:


1. Go to: https://supportprofile.apple.com/MySupportProfile.do
1. Log in if not already logged in.
1. Click on ""edit products""
1. Click on the ""x"" to the right of the product.
1. Click ""unregister""

[\(Source\)](https://discussions.apple.com/message/17088676#17088676)

Almost instantly after I did this, my friend's phone automatically started sending me SMS's instead of iMessages.

I think this proves that it is a quirk of Apple's system (not Verizon or AT&amp;T's, as many were convinced it was) and hopefully they figure out a way to make it more intuitive (or at least train their customer service reps on how to fix it).  At least there's a solution though, and that's all I care about!

This past week i've promised to give away a number of cases here. Well, today I received them and I'm ready to give you a chance to get an awesome case for free! 

All you have to do is reply in this thread with 'enter me' and state which colour you want. I will take replies for 24 Hours before picking Four winners.

These cases are IPhone 4S specific for Verizon and the AT&amp;amp;amp;amp;T and will also fit the IPhone 4 Verizon. All European 4S's will be ok. Throwaway accounts will not be accepted or duplicate accounts. I only ask you pay the shipping cost of your choice but please keep in mind I am located in the UK so shipping may cost a bit, depending on where you are.

So that's it guys, good luck :)

http://imgur.com/xGGvr

Edit: Here is the website for the cases which will go on sale sometime in April. No word on the price yet but they will not be expensive.

http://www.icemdesign.com/yoo/index.php

Edit 2: The cases will be on sale from the 15th April. On the opening day if you order you get free shipping to the UK, Europe or the US. Also if you email the designer at sales@icemdesign and specify which colours you are interested in, you will get a coupon for 5% off your first order. The 5% will be one per person, and this will apply to one case.

I'm still waiting for the pricing but I will update once I have the information. 

Edit 3: There seems to be some confusion about the colours. They are Black, Gold, Red and Pink. If you have not chosen one of these colours please edit your post so you don't miss out. :)

Edit 4: Some more pictures here with the case on the IPhone. If you look at the previously posted pictures you can see that iteration did not include the small cutouts at the Four antenna break points. The addition of these cut outs at the Antenna breaks make it easier for the phone to maintain a good signal. Sorry but i don't have the Blue to give away but it's available on the website when sales start.

Mine would be TalkTo, which lets you text questions to any business and get a response in under 5 minutes. SO great. Want to know if your favorite coffee shop is still open, or still has bagels? Use TalkTo; don't need to call them.

Please check it out.",cyanxx,254,29,112,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/192ug1/spent_the_last_2_years_making_my_dream_music_app/,"Over 2 years ago I got tired of waiting for someone to make the only app I wanted on my iPhone - a guitar tab music sequencer. I wanted to be able to compose guitar music on the bus to work and there just wasn't anything. So I decided to learn how to program and write it myself. 

It was a long journey and I had to rewrite it several times, however I refused to compromise on my dream for the app, and as such I can proudly say today its everything I dreamed it would be. 

The app is called Jam Maestro, and it allows you to sequence 2 guitars, bass and drums together using guitar tab format and play them back in symphony. Think guitar pro but designed for composing rather than learning songs. I have also designed all the instruments so they have maximum playability on the iphone rather than trying to emulate how a real guitar works. 

Full features of the app are listed here: www.jammaestro.com

Here is a video tutorial I made which demonstrates the true power of the app: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okGeCayufgs 

Here is another short one http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzatkVQKJ7M showing tab playback (a cover of a BTBAM song, but shows the kind of sounds you can get out of it).

I released the app today world wide for only 99c (or there equivalent in your country). If you would like to check it out you can find it on the App Store at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jam-maestro/id596628003?mt=8 .

Thanks for reading, and for those that try it I would appreciate any feedback you can give me! Regardless of its type =)

EDIT: I should have said - feel free to email me at support@jammaestro.com if you have any questions, especially about how to use it, and I'll be happy to help in any way I can. 

EDIT2: I'm climbing the charts in USA/UK/CAN guys! If you have the app a review on the app store would be very much appreciated!",,False,self,t5_2qh2b,1361700432.0,,5,True,t3_192ug1,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/192ug1/spent_the_last_2_years_making_my_dream_music_app/,

Edit: Thanks for all the responses! And just to specify I ordered the phone through Sprint, my provider, so I think the mistakes on them not apple. Also the two confirmations slips are confusing me. Does that mean they think I paid for it already? They have the same ""Billing System Order"" number, but different delivery numbers and they came in the same box. If anyone has warehouse or shipping experience maybe they could give me some insight on how and why this happened.

1351889868.0,219,self.iphone,12j7ci,So I just moved from iPhone 4 to Samsung Galaxy S3...,tsteele93,349,130,309,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/12j7ci/so_i_just_moved_from_iphone_4_to_samsung_galaxy_s3/,"I have had iPhones since the 3 and my wife and I trade off upgrades. In other words, she has a 4s and I had a 4 - it was my turn to upgrade when the 5 came out!

I love 99% of the iPhone experience, but the screen has been killing me, I NEED a bigger screen. I had already changed accessibility settings and the fonts were starting to look stupid. I was really hoping for a Galaxy S3 sized iPhone 5...

Needless to say, I was very disappointed when the news was released on the Apple version of making the screen larger. That wasn't what I was looking for when I meant larger.

So... I did some playing and had just about decided on the Note 2 when it came out, and an opportunity came up to get a Galaxy S3 through my work.

Here is what I am finding.

1. PATENT LAWS SUCK. Everything is slightly different. Just enough to not be exactly the same, and just enough to require a complete relearn of the smartphone experience.

2.  The larger screen is AMAZING. The Galaxy is truly a beautiful visual experience. 

3. Interestingly, even though the screen is awesome, side by side, the iPhone has a MUCH brighter, whiter, white. The Samsung has a very cool blue tint. You would never know unless you compare them side by side.

4. The iPhone feels way higher quality. The screen feels thicker, and it just feels nicer.

5. The iPhone is LIGHT years ahead on e-mail. It is ALMOST a deal breaker just how bad android email really is - but I am learning that there are apps that bridge the gap somewhat. I have completely given up on having all my email accounts in one app now and the email app I am leaning towards cost $20! That's enough to basically make the phone just $20 more expensive!

6. I thought texting was horrible, but I'm finding apps that bridge this gap that are inexpensive (free in many cases) that let me load an iPhone theme and almost look/act the same.

7. I'm finding apps are the only thing making android usable. For instance, the keyboard is TERRIBLE. I downloaded SwiftKey and it is simply amazing. The simple keyboard app takes the android typing experience from being way worse than the iPhone and makes it way better than the iPhone.

8. Notifications are terrible. iOS has this down beautifully. I know when I have a text, email, voicemail, phone call and more. With the Samsung, it makes all kinds of noises and gurgles that are meaningless to me right now. I'm sure with some work I will get it fixed, but out of the box it is bad.

9. Editing is a mixed bag. I LOVE the cursor and ability to move the cursor around text easily. Way better than iPhone and I suspect iPhone doesn't have this because of patent issues. On the other hand, things like ""select all"" are not obvious to me.

10. Android isn't intuitive. Apple wins hands down here. I'm constantly staring at my screen wondering, ""how the eff do I send that email"" or ""how do I make the keyboard go back down and get out of my way?"" Lots of things have weird symbols and I have no idea how to tell what to do! It is very frustrating.

11. Most everything you do on Android is a workaround or overly difficult, non-intuitive chore. For instance, if you want to make a folder on a ""home screen"" on iPhone, you drag one icon on top of another and name the newly created folder. With Android, you press and hold a blank spot on the home screen, then select edit and add folder and then you can put stuff in the folder and edit the name of the folder. I didn't even realize it HAD folders and ended up buying a $1.50 app that let me do custom folders (with more visual options) before I learned that you could do plain ones for free.

12. Visually, Android is stunning and hugely customizable. If you have to trick out your workspace, it is for you.

13. Battery life is atrocious. I thought iPhone was bad, I bet I get HALF the life out of the S3! I will either need an extra battery or one of the thicker 4,000+ maH batteries, but I already bought a Seidio Holster/Case so that isn't a great option. I end up charging in the afternoon!

14. The app stores are very close in having all the same apps you NEED. I was afraid I wouldn't have all my favorite apps from the iPhone, but they are in the play store. Maybe not as many fart apps, but the important stuff is there. I DO like that I don't have to enter my frigging password every time I download a FREE app. Drives me crazy that the apple App Store makes me enter my p/w for a free app.

I'm sure that I have a lot to learn, I've only had the Galaxy S3 a few days (about 4 days) but those are my first I impressions.

If someone were to ask me if they should switch from iPhone to the Samsung Galaxy S3, I would say, ""If you are happy with the iPhone - stay with the iPhone. If you are unhappy with the iPhone, stay with the iPhone. If you are unhappy with the iPhone screen size, then consider the Samsung Galaxy S3 or perhaps even the Samsung Note 2 but be ready for some things you aren't going to like as well as the iPhone!""

To Apple's credit, the overall user experience is far better and far more polished than Android. Android is catching up, but IMPORTANT apps like email just aren't there and honestly, WHY? Why isn't email as good as Apple by now? I get emails that do not fit on screen, I can barely tell what is read and what isn't. I had to download touchdown HD to get a decent exchange app and it cost $20. Gmail is terrible. Most Android mail options are NOT push... It is really poor. And that is a shame because email is a make-it-or-break-it app!

On the other hand, why can't apple offer a larger sized iPhone? They lost me because of that and I REALLY didn't want to leave.

Feel free to ask questions and I'll tell you what I can...

I ran into some problems installing ios 7 through the restore function in iTunes.

Here are the 2 steps you've got to take:

1. Download the correct .ipsw file for your device (I don't care if you use torrents, mirrors or the official download link from apple) link: [all ipsw direct downloads](http://www.evad3rs.net/2013/04/ios-7-download-install-links-how-to.html)

2. connect your phone to iTunes and (Alt/Option for mac, or Shift for Windows) on the Update button instead the restore button.

**EDIT: Use the Check for updates button!! not Restore!**

Edit 2: Added link to mirror .ipsw download files

Within 5 minutes, my iOS 7 beta was running smoothly!

I just wanted to share a warning with you.  I've been using an iPhone in iOS 5 for some time now, and until recently, loved the iMessage feature.  It worked great, saved me money, and was just all around wonderful.

Until I broke my iPhone.

I decided that rather than spend a lot of money to get it fixed, I would switch to a new phone, and ended up getting an Android phone.  The problem?  Apple won't disassociate my phone number from my iMessage account.  This means that when you try to text my number from an iPhone, it sends as an iMessage, which I can't receive because I no longer have an iPhone.  Basically, I can't get text messages any more from most of my friends.

So be warned - if you ever plan on switching to a non-iOS phone (or if you might lose your phone, or if there's any chance you could ever have your phone stolen, etc.) there is a good chance people won't be able to text you anymore.  In the case of the stolen or lost phones, the person who has your phone will get your texts (according to some people, this happens even if you remote wipe the phone).

Now, some people say they've had luck getting iMessage to stop using their phone number if they deactivate it BEFORE switching phones.  It's too late for me to do this, so I don't know for sure if it works.  I just wanted to let you all know so you can possibly avoid the situation I'm in.",,False,self,t5_2qh2b,False,,,True,t3_nlq8k,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/nlq8k/a_warning_for_imessage_users/,

It's available worldwide, but it may take an hour or so before it becomes available in your country's iTunes store.


Hi everyone,


As some of you may know, I've been busily working on an iPad version for Alien Blue.  Well Apple just approved it!  I thought I would also answer some of the questions that others have asked on various threads.

----------------------------------------------------

** How is Alien Blue HD different to Safari for browsing Reddit? **

I wanted Alien Blue on the iPad to be a very different experience when using Reddit.  I have developed the entire browser experience around a sidebar that allows a fast and intuitive way to switch between subreddits, posts and comments without having to move back and forth between screens.  It's been designed so that you always have context without needing to open multiple tabs in the background.  I hope you'll enjoy using it as much as I enjoy developing it.

----------------------------------------------------

** Can I customize the way things look in Alien Blue HD? **

You certainly can.  Alien Blue HD defaults to a Minimalist layout in comments (similar to the Reddit website.)  You can also switch to Boxed comments (or Classic) via:

Settings -&gt; Comment Settings -&gt; Comments Display Style

**Note:** I highly recommend that you enable ""Show Domain On Post List"" in the preferences section (apologies, this should have been enabled by default).

----------------------------------------------------

** Why isn't this a universal app? **

There are two reasons:

1. I don't want to affect the donation-ware model of Alien Blue on the iPhone

2. I'm already shit-scared when I'm releasing updates for a single device.  With approx 2 weeks in review for each critical update, I'm in a perpetual state of stress thinking that I may be releasing another bug that I can do absolutely nothing about for two weeks after approval.  With two separate versions, I can at least focus on one release at a time.

----------------------------------------------------

** How much work did it take to get here? **

You can see the [changelog](http://alienblue.org/beta/changelog-hd.txt) for the launch version.

----------------------------------------------------

** Why isn't it free? **

Here's what I wrote in another thread prior to the launch of ABHD:

&gt; I'm making this one a paid app, so that I can keep up the time and resources to continue development. Only about 2-5% of users upgrade Alien Blue to Pro (equates to about $50-$70 per week) and I put in about 40-50 hours each week to it's development in addition to my existing contracts. I'm hoping that ABHD will at least give me a bit of breathing room, so that I can reduce my contract work load.

&gt; The free version of the app is purposefully unrestrictive so that people contribute only if they like the app, not because they have to.  Alternatives were to include advertising within the apps, but this is not a road I want to head down. Even with the 95+% free user base, I don't want to reduce their enjoyment of the app via mobile ads.

----------------------------------------------------

** Is there an update already on the way? **

You bet your ass!

If you like the app, please be sure to leave a review on the App Store.  These definitely help with approvals.",,False,self,t5_2qh2b,True,,,True,t3_ddw3u,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/ddw3u/alien_blue_hd_for_the_ipad_is_now_available_on/,

That is the directory where iTunes seems to extract IPSW files for restoring your phone.  As a jailbreaker after attempting a few failed restores I noticed my free disk space was disappearing by the hundreds of megabytes.  I knew what was going on-- iTunes wasn't cleaning it up, and CCleaner wasn't searching it as a temp working dir either.  I just didn't know where it was, and couldn't find anything through Google.

I just freed up almost 2 gigs.

*: Just to reiterate- this is not the directory of where iTunes saves packaged IPSW files, nor is it the directory where iTunes stores iDevice backups. Those are:

*  C:\Documents and Settings\[*Useraccount*]\Application Data\Apple Computer\iTunes

*  C:\Documents and Settings\[*Useraccount*]\Application Data\Apple Computer\MobileSync

Cleaning up both of those can free up quite a bit of space as well, and the backups can be managed from within iTunes.  The one I am talking about is where you will find large, undeleted temp files that iTunes created when updating or restoring your iPhone/Pod/Device.

Just wanted to share how useful it is and everyone should have it turned on if they don't already.

Edit: Came back 18 hours later and this post got a lot more response than I thought it would. First off we're located in northern Baltimore so the phone ended up a pretty good distance away.

I am, as you all probably are, an avid iPhone user. I love learning new, cool things that I can do with this wonderful phone, should that be with the default OS, Jailbreaks, apps, etc.

I find that this sub-reddit has been getting worse and worse over the past couple of weeks. Almost every post is about a small glitch, a hardware issue, and things that you could easily look up for yourself. This is a drag.

This sub-reddit should take a turn for the better. Focusing more on this as mentioned in the first paragraph and less on the things as mentioned in the second.

To solve this, I think there should be rule changes that take part here, and and all iPhone problems should be sent over to /r/iphonehelp.

1375975998.0,175,self.iphone,1jylan,Holy Cow! My app is currently ranked the #2 Productivity App in the App Store... in Saudi Arabia!,eskimoroll,239,64,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/1jylan/holy_cow_my_app_is_currently_ranked_the_2/,"Lol, this is so random and pretty cool. Yesterday, my downloads started spiking like crazy and I saw a bunch of tweets hit my feed in Arabic. I didn't think too much of it but the end result is that I'm now a top app in Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait. 

The even crazier thing is that my app helps you search across your Gmail, Dropbox, and Google Drive files in ENGLISH. Most of our new users are actually not on Gmail but rather Yahoo and Hotmail.

There are a few interesting learnings from this. 

* The first is that the problem we're solving resonates across the globe. 

* The second is that we need to consider the adoption of email platforms globally rather than simply retaining a US-centric view. While we still probably will add support for Microsoft Exchange next, we will really pay attention to whether IMAP support for Yahoo/Hotmail makes sense.

* The third thing is that we need to support multiple languages. The really cool part of this is that we already have been working on that and internally, we've tested Russian and Arabic and we think we've figured that out! We'll have to test Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters next. We'll be pushing an update soon that should really expand our potential user base.

We really started this business with US business professionals in mind but this last day has really opened our eyes to the possibilities. Super interesting stuff!

Edited to add: It was pretty surreal seeing my little app ranked higher than Gmail and Dropbox even though it's a small market. Also, just checked the numbers and we were also the #1 Productivity App in Yemen and Egypt.

Oh and in case you're curious, our website is [here](http://www.getfindit.com) and the app is called FindIt.

So I decided to develop an app, I've done all the design work and have someone currently coding it.

Basically the app allows you to see others traveling to the same country/city you're going to during the same time(think of it almost like a match-making service), and then you can message them and travel with them if you decide to.

You can see other users nearby (obviously you have the option to hide your location) and message/connect with them.

There is also a virtual passport feature where you collect stamps for every city you check in to.

I created a simple landing page for now at www.backpackrapp.com and the name is temporary as it's still early in the development phase.

I'm looking for some feedback, as this is the first app I've ever developed. What problems/issues do you foresee? Do you know of any apps similar to this?
