###FAQ

**Q**: When will Starbound be released?  
&gt;**A**: There are no release dates yet (ignore all the rumors!). Any date set is purely speculation since the game is still being developed. Some Starbounders have a habit of estimating when it will come out, but this is just guess work.

**Q**: Is there a beta out?  
&gt;**A**: Not yet, the developers are only letting a tiny group of people test the game (family and friends). However, there has been an official announcement saying that [**there will be an open beta eventually**](http://i.imgur.com/6NXnt.jpg), but there hasn't been a date set yet.  

[More Info](http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/16i7se/preorder_beta_confirmed/)

**Q**: How can I support the game?  
&gt;**A**: There is currently no way to pre-order or crowd-fund the game. There are also no options to donate directly to the developers. *However*, you *can* support the developers by [**purchasing Wanderlust**](http://store.steampowered.com/app/211580/). The game is Chucklefish's first published game, so a cut of the sales will go to the developers of Starbound.  

[More info](http://playstarbound.com/support-starbound-development-with-wanderlust-rebirth/)

*""A percentage of Wanderlust sales will go straight to Chucklefish and support Starbound development.""* - Tiy

**Q**: Will the game be on Steam?  
&gt;**A**: It's been confirmed that they are aiming to release the game on Steam, and hope to integrate it with steamworks. Starbound has been scheduled for the following platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux and [Ouya](https://twitter.com/Tiyuri/status/281401347855749121). There has been no information on console releases as of yet.

&lt;@Tiy&gt; are you guys going to help me spread the word when the preorder goes live?

&lt;@Tiy&gt; make the earth shake with the power of our tweets

&lt;@Tiy&gt; I dont want to promise tomorrow, because if I do and then something happens to stall it

&lt;@Tiy&gt; everyone will murder me with rusty spoons

&lt;@Tiy&gt; we're TRYING for tomorrow though
_______

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Pixel tier  -  1x copy of the full game, when its ready. 1x copy of the beta, when its ready, 1x starbound soundtrack, 1x experimental soundtrack (66 tracks total i believe)

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Pixel tier 4 pack - all of the above x4

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Silver tier, all of the above + a contributors penguin forum badge

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Silver tier 4 pack

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Gold Tier - all the above, the forum badge is tier 2, you get to name an NPC

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Diamond tier - all the above, tier 3 forum badge, you get to name an npc and your name goes in the credits

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Platinum Tier - all above, tier 4 forum badge, you get to name an npc, name goes in credits + you get to design a hat

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Solarium Tier - game (when ready), beta (when ready), soundtrack, tier 5 badge, name npc, name in credits, design a weapon (its design, how it fires/swings)

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Impervium Tier - game (when ready), beta (when ready), soundtrack, tier 6 badge, name npc, name in credits, get a statue of yourself in the game as an object

&lt;@Tiy&gt; and finally

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Avian Tier (Price: Free) - no game/soundtrack, but you get a nifty forum badge in return for tweeting about the game

&lt;@Tiy&gt; The high level tiers are pretty expensive, kickstarter style, theyre for people who really want to invest in us

&lt;@Tiy&gt; but I think the base price is good, $15 for the game + a 66 track soundtrack

______

&lt;@Rekalty&gt; What kind of pricing are we looking at for the higher tiers, Tiy? 

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Rekalty high :P

&lt;@Tiy&gt; gold will be AROUND $45

&lt;@Tiy&gt; Impervium will be AROUND $2k

&lt;@Tiy&gt; second lowest is silver

&lt;@Tiy&gt; around $20, or $60 for a 4 pack

&lt;@Tiy&gt; $10k gets you molly flown to your house, where she'll serenade you with her ukulele, drink all your wine and vomit cake all over your rug

&lt;@mollygos&gt; shit i'd be happy to do that for the free wine and cake 

&lt;@Tiy&gt; all of these will get you a steam key

1364980134.0,113,self.starbound,1bkta7,Starbound Roadmap: Text Edition,Herdo,123,10,26,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/1bkta7/starbound_roadmap_text_edition/,"**I also have this [posted to the forums](http://community.playstarbound.com/index.php?threads/starbound-roadmap-text-edition.16698/), and I think it's a bit easier to read due to formatting.  I will keep both updated.**

I've decided to catalog the information on the Roadmap in a text version.  The main reason for doing this is to keep a log of the completion of each section, and to keep track of the information associated with each section.  Right now it's unknown how the information will be updated, and it's possible it will simply be updated without any notice, so my thinking is that some things may go unnoticed.  Having it in a text form will allow us to compare the two and see if anything has been updated.

I plan to have the current Roadmap posted in the main body here, and the changes posted in the comments.  If you notice a change that I haven't yet updated, please let me know and I will update the thread.


**UNIVERSE GENERATION**


* **Universe / sector generation 90%**

The Universe is divided into sectors, each sector contains a huge number of solar systems. Sector generation, solar system generation, planet generation and orbiter generation systems are complete. We may add more features to this, however, as well as the ability to insert hard-coded systems and special areas as we progress.  [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sector.png)

* **Biome Content 90%**

A large number of biomes are present and content complete. There is always room to add additional trees, bushes, plants, and completely new biomes. We’ll be constantly adding these post release.

* **Mini Biomes 60%**

We have a number of mini biomes per larger biome, these biomes need to be given unique drops and more of a purpose. Though they do currently provide a nice level of variety. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/minibiome.png)

* **World-level parameter gen 70%**

The world generation code is capable of choosing biomes, terrain shapes, temperature, liquids, weather, ore distribution, underground layers, cave structure and more. However these elements need to be tied to the planet’s level to create an overall difficulty.

* **Star / Planet orbital rendering 80%**

Planet art is generated to appear beneath the players ship when the player is in orbit. The planet art matches the biome present on the planet as well as the planet’s dominant liquid. The travel animation from planet to planet / solar system to solar system needs to be smoother. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/orbit.png)

* **World bookmarking, storage 80%**

World storage is largely complete, though may require additional work when new features are added. World bookmarking isn’t in yet and will become part of the Starmap. 


**WORLD GENERATION**

* **Biome/Terrain Selection 90%**

Based on the distance to a star and what type of star it is, and the size of the planet, certain biomes are selected. Appropriate terrain for the biome is selected from a pool. [Image1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen11.png) [Image2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen12.png) [Image3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen13.png)

* **Terrain / Cave generation 90%**

Generators are completed for hills, flats, mountains, canyons, chasms, islands and more. However at present each planet only makes use of one generator based on it’s selected biome. We would like multiple terrain generators to make up the planets surface. Cave gen is largely complete, some code is needed to ensure caves are present in rare underground biomes. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen21.png)

* **Liquid Placement 90%**

Liquid placement is complete, with lakes, small pockets of water and entire oceans appearing. However there are still bugs with the implementation linked to dungeon generation interacting with it. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen31.png)

* **Large Dungeon Placement 90%**

Generates a very large, explorable dungeon. Complete and fully configurable. Currently, generates exactly 1 randomly chosen dungeon per world, need to tweaks when and where to generate dungeons, because it is currently too predictable. Also need to force dungeon materials to be very difficult to remove compared to regular blocks. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen41.png)

* **Mini Terrain/Dungeon Placement 70%**

These are small block/object patterns that are used to add predefined features to the terrain. For example a fallen log creating a bridge across a lake could be produced this way and the engine would find suitable places along the terrain to have it appear. 


This feature is code complete and lots of these templates already exist but we would like to add more, along with some biome specific templates come release. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen51.png)

* **Plants/Object/Chest Placement 90%**

The engine is capable of spawning any defined object or plant in a defined distribution around a biome. This is more or less code complete, though more objects need to be configured to appear. A small task. [Image1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen72.png) [Image2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen61.png)

* **Plant Growing 60%**

Crops, grass and trees all need to grow over time. Crop growth is complete, but grass spreading needs work and tree growth need to share the same code. Crops currently appear in biomes but do not spawn fully grown as they should. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen71.png)

* **Parallax &amp; Colour Processing 90%**

Parrallax and colour shifting is complete, a couple of parallax bugs require a fix but the parallax system is robust enough to create almost any kind of backdrop. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen81.png)

* **Weather / Time / Temperature 90%**

Largely complete, biomes have their own temperature ranges and sets of weather patterns. Rain, snow, wind, thunderstorms, sunshine and more already exist in the game and the player temperature mechanic is complete, though the stats may need tweaking to provide the correct level of challenge. Day/Night cycles are complete and their length based on the planets position around it’s sun. As well as light they also have an effect on temperature and mob spawns. [Image1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen91.png) [Image2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen92.png) [Image3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/worldgen93.png)

**CREATURE GENERATION** 

* **Quadrupeds 70%**

The game can produce a huge range of quadruped npcs, with unique behaviours, stats, size and art. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/quad.png)

* **Bipeds 70%**

The game can produce a huge range of biped npcs, with unique behaviours, stats, size and art. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/biped.png)

* **Fish 50%**

The generator for fish NPCs and all of it’s art has been configured but fish do not yet appear in game. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fish.png)

* **Flying 50%**

The generator for flying NPCs and all of it’s art has been configured but they do not yet appear in game. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/flying.png)

* **Humanoids 20%**

Humanoid npcs include villagers and dungeon guardians. The ground work has been laid to get these into the game dynamically. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon13.png)

* **Pregenerated NPCs 50%**

A number of pregenerated NPCs appear in the game and we’d like to add a handful of unique npcs per dungeon/village. 

* **Behaviour Scripts 50%**

A number of NPC behaviour scripts are complete and more are being added, these can be applied to all NPCs and are performed differently based on the NPCs stats.

* **Enemy Projectiles 60%**

Ranged enemies can be set to shoot any projectile, or for that projectile to be chosen dynamically. A number of enemy projectiles already exist. More are being added.

**DUNGEONS AND VILLAGES**

* **Dungeon/Village generation 80%**

Dungeon generation is complete, though occasionally we do need to add additional features when a new dungeon demands something of the engine it can’t currently do. We have a large number of dungeons and villages in the game, the layout for each is procedurally generated each time. Each race has at least two dungeons and 1 village, often more. Of these the majority are in the game, with others already designed and graphically complete, awaiting layouts. [Image1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon12.png) [Image2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon13.png) [Image3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeons11.png)

* **Dungeon protection 20%**

Players will be unable to break dungeon objects/blocks until they destroy an item that protects the dungeon. This item needs to be implemented. [Image](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/dungeon21.png)

**QUESTS AND MISSIONS**

* **Interact with NPCs 20%**

NPC interaction is largely limited to combat at present. Quest generation is one of our next big goals with development. The quest and shop UI has been designed and is ready to be placed in the game. Friendly NPCs will protect their property and will speak differently to players of different races. 

* **Quest management UI 40%**

The quest management UI has been designed and mocked up, ready to be implemented.

The game is being developed, and things are being demonstrated selectively. The game is not being showcased wholesale. [From IRC:](http://pastebin.com/B9Du3L2k)

""&lt;Tiyuri&gt; it also makes things very hard to stream also

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; A good example of that is npcs

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; npcs have a behaviour system, each npc piece can have a unique behaviour attached to it

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and then it mixes and matches them

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; to get a unique npc

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; but of course, every npc behaviour we create (which are written in lua files, for the interested)

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; needs to be tested

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and testing a new behaviour when there are tons of possible combinations is.. well.. not doable

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; honestly

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; so what we do is disable everything

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and enable one behaviour at a time

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; but when i stream

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; people (reasonably) assume

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; that npcs only have one behaviour

&lt;Tiyuri&gt; and are dumb and boring""

These streams are even less representational of the final thing than the beta would be. So relax. Don't prime your expectations.

&gt;well I will ask the most provocative question....why all the fluff? I know you guys are trying to make your game perfect, which I love....but why the extra instead of the actual ground work? I think if this was done, we would already have a beta...

This was Tiy's response:

&gt;The ground work stuff is always being worked on. There's usually at least two programmers adding essential features at any one time. Given that they're major features however, we tend not to post about them daily. ""We did a little bit more work on..."" doesn't make for an interesting daily post.

&gt;We of course do also add things that aren't absolutely essential for the game to function. But calling them fluff understates their importance. A game with only the bare minimum of features is a game without a soul. The impression you get when you play the game for the first time can be driven just as much by small, unessential features as big, required groundwork. 

&gt;Who decides what is and isn't required anyway?

&gt;We have an experience we want to deliver. The features we choose to add ARE essential to creating that experience. It's a question of tone, charm, atmosphere. These are the things that take a game to the next level. 

This pretty much sums up the reasons as-to why a beta isn't a likely event in the near future.

The thing that Tiy said in this post that really stuck out to me was

&gt;A game with only the bare minimum of features is a **game without a soul.**

Think of all the other games you've played. Think of all the game's you've enjoied. Did you enjoy them purly because the mechanics of the game functioned? Or did you enjoy them because the content within them gave the game it's own character?

Just something to think about.

Because we're responsible and professional people, we have recent backups, and we also had a server lined up to put them on.  However, it seems that despite our best preparations, we got thrown a curve ball.  One of the hard drives in the replacement server has also failed, so we are unable to set it up right now.  :(

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; however

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; the game is so far along, so many systems are done, its essentially very playable already

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; theres no chance of it fizzling out

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; we just put insane levels of detail into everything

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; and i dont do videos on anything until that insane level of detail is realised


&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; to give another example of our attention to detail

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; every single material in the game gives off its own footstep sounds when walked on

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; or jumped on

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; a largeeeee number of objects in the game make sounds

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; when someone accesses a chest, it opens in front of them, when they leave the chest screen, it closes

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; a lot of objects are interactive just for the sake of being interactive

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; see a gong in an avian temple? you can go and bang it

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; every block and every object has a description

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; you can examine everything

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; and whilst its very easy to say that these things aren't essential, just release the game already.

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; I disagree, I think putting this all together gives you more than the sum of it's parts


&lt;Arpege&gt; Can you only beam to planets Tiyuri, or can you beam into an asteroid belt as well? Just a bunch of large chunks of rock floating about in space with rare materials in them, but extremely dangerous and difficult to move from asteroid to asteroid

&lt;Arpege&gt; Sort've like sky islands but in space :B

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; by release youll be able to beam onto planets (done already), moons (done already), asteroids (not done, but actually very easy to do, just havent gotten around to it), and ships in flight (done already)

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; and possibly some more

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; also friends ships

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; you can go there

&lt;WarStalkeR&gt; Tiyuri: you said ships in flight... Then it means possibly an space ship battles too?

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; not for release

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; but i have an idea on how space ship battles will work

&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; for post release


&lt;@Tiyuri&gt; I need to do a video of the building system

So I’ve spent about the past week or so working on this. Initially I wanted to do one large image but I found out that a large image + 150 frames of animations = BOOM. So I then had to slice the images, spit out the gifs into their own files, and then reassemble the whole thing. Well here it is and I hope it gets you as excited as I am. Feel free to spread this around as that’s the entire purpose of why I made it.

I also have to give credit to the Reddit user [Suasive](http://www.reddit.com/user/Suasive) for the inspiration otherwise I may have never done it.

And my designs were really bad so in some cases i just copied stuff from terrariawiki's JPGs with the aid of the grid tool.

Given that SB is set in a more technological era, having blueprints might be something feasible and should not detract to the feel of the game, it could even probably give more appeal to pixel architects who'd love to share their carefully constructed designs.

Blueprints for particular structures might be even be some kind of item drop, like special temples from races who triggers quests-events, zoo-natural habitats to let some kind of creatures appear, to call boss battles, etc.

**IMPLEMENTATION**

blueprints are just a text file and a slot occupying item in game. inside the file are coded the number of resource needed and their place in the project, should be doable to translate in a x-y grid system for placement, given that the low-left angle is always (0,0).

**FILE FORMAT:**

an example square made of gold wall blocks:

GoldWall(1):12 (let the game know it needs 12 gold wall blocks and assigns it number 1 in the grid identifier)

    1:line(0,0)(0,4)
    1:line(0,0)(4,0)
    1:line(0,4)(4,4)
    1:line(4,0)(4,4)
or just 1:rectangle(0,0)(4,4). this would tell the game how and where the blocks should be put. we can have more ""functions"" like circle(center_x,center_y,radius) and so on.

the blueprint can be used in game, a resizable window opens with a grind and the project rendered in the game engine, so you can manually build it from there.

**MORE ITEMS ASSOCIATED WITH BLUEPRINTS**

Engineering Book: Lets you collect all your blueprints in a single itemslot.

Engineering Camera: Lets you select an area and create a blueprint from that.

WorldNet Engineering Computer: lets you import-export from/to disk-internet the sharable blueprints (not the eventual ""quest"" blueprints). can be portable or something that must be placed to be used.

BuildBot Mark I: automatically builds any given blueprint. Must be fed the needed resources and a blueprint before starting, you place the construction with the mouse. Very slow and resources needed are +100% of normal. Very inefficient, but you can go explore and come back to find a base!

BuildBot Mark II: same as Mark I, +50% use of resources, normal speed.

BuildBot Mark III: the best buildbot, fast and use +15% of resources.
(the added resource use is just a drawback for the automatism)

Hyper galactic 3d printer: it just prints out the building at lighting fast speed, needs same resources like the blueprint, superefficient and super rare.

**CONCLUSION**

There are a lot of problems associated with the idea (what if i put some blocks in the way of a builder, crash to desktop? the builder removes the block and it's lost? what if there's an item or a monster? we can't let the buildbots kill everything or it will be used to destroy bosses) but i thought it would be nice to try and share it!",,False,self,t5_2tkp6,False,,glitch-m,True,t3_1doc0s,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/1doc0s/proposal_blueprints_wall_of_text_and_mockup/,

Greetings fellow Starbound comrades, 

I was a bit hesitant to post this for fear of it sounding like self promotion, but here we go:

Over the past two weeks I have been developing Starbound Codex, an android app which aims to be your go-to mobile app for all information involving Starbound (kinda like those Minecraft crafting reference apps, except better looking).  

Now you may be thinking ""How can you make a Starbound reference app when the game isn't out yet?""  Well good sir and/or madam, it's not done yet.  At this moment it is a Starbound news app which pulls from the official site and formats each news post to nicely fit your screen.  All news is viewed in-app, no need to launch a browser.

Now, here is where I ask for your assistance.  Although the app is not finished as far as what features are planned, the news functionality **is** largely finished and I am in need of people to **test it and help find bugs**.  So please give it a try [(link)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rocksoft.starbound.guide) and let me know what you think.  **Please tell me if you find any bugs or have any feature requests.**

Some of the features I plan to add when Starbound beta testing begins:

* Crafting recipes/blueprints
* Item database
* Weapon/Tool database
* Monster type database? (depends on how generation works)

Of course this all depends on how the procedural generation works and how much the generated content can be generalized. Let me know if you have any feature suggestions!

Last note: I apologize for the ads, let me know if you think they're too frequent and I'll see about reducing them. I will most likely be adding a donation option to remove them if people are interested, keep in mind I am a college student trying to make ends meet.

I hope you guys find this useful, thanks!

I love the art style, and played Terraria for countless hours, but I would love to see the pixel art vectorized using something similar to this approach:

http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/kopf/pixelart/

mostly just out of curiosity to see how the game would look.  Obviously, I'm not considering any implementation details.... but I think  the art in this game lends itself well to this research paper by microsoft.

&lt;3 to the Starbound team, you guys are the best. I look forward to the beta!

[Edit]
For those who don't want to read a research paper the TLDR: Basically, its an algorithm that takes an input of low resolution pixel art (individual sprites or backgrounds in Starbound's case) and converts it into resolution independent vector images.  It has nice smooth looking results and was intended for use in emulators of old NES and SNES games.  

For examples look at the supplementary material or google image search Depixelizing Pixel Art

For those that cannot type it in to enable it (Nothing happens in the above method)

1. Open chrome and go to the starbound roadmap

Often in Diablo or Terraria I end up dragging and dropping excess items (crafting mats, minerals,  etc.) around from one box to the other box.  This is time consuming and boring.  Also when using a stash or chests the items end up cluttered and hard to find.

On my terraria server there are 20 chests in our fort filled with all sorts of junk from people just dumping the contents of their inventory to make more space for adventuring.  Now it is very hard to find the items we need and have to search a bunch of chests haphazardly.

Players could be more organized and dedicate chests with signs for certain items, but no one wants to spend their gaming time doing this.

If there was a different type of chest for each item type that would help organize but still would put the onus on the player to sort.

Please make our ""stash"" self organizing and easy to navigate!

Perhaps the Ship's inventory could be an abstraction of every chest on every planet or something.

I have an idea I'd like to present to the community and the developers for something to keep us busy until we can actually discuss the content in the game when we get more information.  


As much customization as there is to the character creator, there's always room for more options so that every character can be a SPECIAL SNOWFLAKE. Looking at ways to expand the options without getting too crazy falls to two big things in my mind: Adding colors, and adding more heads/hairs.  

Proposal:  

Step 1:  


Hey developers: Is there any way you can offer up the technical details on how the hair/heads of the sprites work? I'd like to be able to have a Community submission project where we can submit a head matching certain criteria:  

* Does it meet technical specifications (color/size/transparencies/filetype/etc)
* Does it match the style of Starbound (developer approval, high standards)
* Is it significantly different than options already provided in game
* Not copyright breaking or otherwise stupid/meme/reference
* Legal mumbo jumbo of all ownership belongs to Chucklefish/starbound upon submission  


Step 2:  

With the guidelines of resolution, transparency, colours, etc, users would create heads and hairstyles for all races they'd want added to the game. Just host them on a large gallery for the developers to peruse and take what they want to add to the game.


Step 3:

Maybe if we are lucky Tiy or one of the other devs will read this and we can help influence their decision. Now obviously I really want to play the game as i'm sure all of you do, but lets try not to let bias influence our PROs and CONs. As people post more I will add them to the list!

**CONs**

* A lot of people will no doubt fail to understand what a beta is no matter how many places it is explained and will rage at the incomplete nature of a beta product

* Releasing the beta now will cost chucklefish money in bandwidth with every updated version as people swarm to download it in huge quantities 

* It is possible reviewers will jump the gun and review the beta product, leading to a lower score than the game would have received if released after more polish

* Once released the forums would likely become a mass of feature/bug begging -thanks Kiofspa

**PROs**

* The Devs will receive a comprehensive list of all the bugs in the current version of the game

* The Devs will gain a ton of information on how the game works on a huge variety of systems

* There will be a large boost in sales

* Youtubers will provide a huge amount of free advertising for the game once they can start making starbound videos

* It will stop the constant begging for the Beta that I have no doubt the devs run into every time they turn around

* It will provide a ton of user feedback and ideas for how the game can be improved before it is fully released

There could be awesome loot or simply the ability to colonize the planet afterwards.  What are you guys' thoughts?

When using melee weapons, you could only strike them right in front of you. An example of this would be George's spear in last week's livestream. I feel that this is an unnecessary and artificial restriction.

Those of you who played Terraria may remember how you could aim your spears there: When you attacked, the spear went wherever your mouse pointed.

For Starbound, I hoped you could do the same thing with every melee weapon. And I see no reason why this should be impossible or difficult to implement.

I'm aware the dev team said there would be an upcoming overhaul of the combat system, but they also stated that they would model the melee combat after Symphony of the Night, which had no free aiming either.

The recent Q&amp;A session was simply amazing. However, one thing still concerns me - in every open world game, the fun always seems to come to a crashing halt at endgame. Of course, in Starbound, you will never run out of new planets to visit, but this doesn't mean you would really have a purpose. 

What do you think would keep you playing after you have obtained all the tier 10 tech, armour, weapons and have a mega fortress planet? Personally, I quite like the idea of mega construction projects - objects that take huge amounts of rare and common materials, requiring you to explore far and wide to get it all together, kind of like a scavenger hunt. Then these objects do amazing unique things - i.e terraforming, doomsday cannons - big things to add to your base ",,False,self,t5_2tkp6,False,,,True,t3_17dbtq,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/17dbtq/endgame_activities/,

1350171110.0,43,self.starbound,11fpoh,The random monster generator: how I think it works.,CornishCucumber,49,6,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/11fpoh/the_random_monster_generator_how_i_think_it_works/,"NOTE: This is my own interpretation, I'm not entirely sure if this is true!

Okay, so I've been looking at the previous Friday 'random monster' posts, and I believe this is how it works:

There are two different types of monster, ones that stand (like humans) and ones on all fours. These are made up of three different main components; the head, body and feet. These sections are layered accordingly depending on the monster's stance (i.e. the back legs appear behind the body, whereas the front legs are layered on top.) I believe there may also be several more layers (feet + hands), but I'm not entirely sure.

I also think two colours will be used, the primary colour and the secondary colour (other than default images, like the cats, steel arms, wheels, teeth, eyes, etc). So these colours will be randomly generated using a little bit of code.

Here are a few examples I've made using previous posts:

[Image One](http://imgur.com/c8zVD.png)  

[Image Two](http://imgur.com/IwD3E.png)  

[Image Three](http://imgur.com/kGwzF.png)  

[Image Four](http://imgur.com/G4vaQ.png)  

[Image Five](http://imgur.com/kcMtk.png)

Note: I also think that there will be categories of monsters, like dinosaur, mecha, humanoid, so variations might be limited to avoid very strange monsters. I also think that each component (i.e head) will have a joint-node telling the program where to place the other limbs (i.e. to the body) otherwise you'll get some very broken looking monsters...",,False,self,t5_2tkp6,1350174712.0,,human-m,True,t3_11fpoh,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/11fpoh/the_random_monster_generator_how_i_think_it_works/,

What if we could set servers that instead of normal servers, were simply... how to put it... Sort of like how that game on PlayStation Journey did, you play single player, and randomly, others would appear around.

So like, say, we have an option to enable some mode called 'Wanderer Mode' or something, which when allowed, automatically finds others with this on, and lets them meet in special worlds (Maybe generated only upon finding a match, so they both get the same seed), just meeting total strangers, which may be trolls, but may also be nice people you could befriend.

It sorts of feels cool, adds to the plot of our races having left our homeworld for X/Y reason and got scattered, like yo were finding other explorers in your journeys that are not npcs.

Basically a pseudo-multiplayer mode that is still single player, but letting you see individuals, one at a time. (Kind of like chatroulette?)

Am I the only one that thinks this could be fun? Or am I nuts here? :P

I AM aware this mode could be abused by griefers, hence why use special worlds made only for this or something, you would only meet them elsewhere if you then played on a server proper. (This assumes we get some sort of friend list of course).

What are you criticisms on the game so far? How would you improve it?

 Saying that the game isn't even released for us to criticise is a cop out if you ask me. If we have seen enough to praise the game then we have seen enough to criticise it.

I hate multiplayer games, and I was just wondering if any of you have heard of whether or not, any of the content on this game would be exclusively available in multi? Like tech between races and the like. 

I know that most would likely disagree, but I do not like it when acquiring certain content in a game, is tied to social interaction, and forces you to interact with the community. 

Now Starbound seems to have an awesome community already, and is forcing me to rethink this tact. But I was just wondering if this is going to be the case. I would much rather have the option of forgoing interaction if it makes me uncomfortable, rather then being forced to enmesh myself into potential minecraftian level griefer community, in order to complete the game( already though, as I said, this doesn't look to be the case :) ).

This may be covered elsewhere, but I cannot find any clear answers (I may not be looking hard enough).

TL;DR: Is multiplay required, to get 100% completion, or all techs?

I'm no game developer by any means, but i'm a gamer and I'm a dreamer. Ever since I first got hopelessly lost in the endless world in Minecraft, my view on videogames changed dramatically. I came up with a few really cool concepts for games, hoping to think of one simple enough to get me into programming. All of a sudden I stumble on Project Zomboid, read it's planned details and am left thinking ""...well I can cross that one off the list"". Same exact thing happened with Terraria. I saw it's announcement trailer and at the same time saw one of my 'dream games' play out right in front of me. I was down to just a couple ideas until I heard about Starbound. 

This is kinda a big thank you to the indie game scene in general, but I just wanted to say I'm really excited for this game, and I find it very inspiring.

What I had in mind is that maybe there could be an item ingame for this, which perhaps added 5-10 inventory slots or something else, maybe a possibility for a heavier gun or more guns carried at the same time, depending on how the mechanics work exactly. It might replace armor (or negate some, due to exposed hydraulics or whatnot), requiring the players to decide between armor and extra carry capacity. This would encourage players to have one player with an exoskeleton in the expedition, who could carry extra ammo/weapons/tools for the others, or help with carrying loot back to the ship.

Or (and I apologize for referencing Terraria here), but it would make the hellivator that much more realistic.  No more jumping 20 miles straight down into hell to your death.  You could slide all the way down.

And a 3rd thought, maybe not slides so as much as slippery hills, but it might make traversing ice dungeons that much more rewarding, since some of the hills would be too slippery to climb up, and would require special gear.

## Starbound Text Roadmap
Summary|Section|Completion|Images
:---|:---|:---|:---
**Player Mechanics**|
The full set of player movements is complete, this includes walking, running, crouching and swimming. The keyboard and mouse is the default method of control and currently the only one implemented. Though gamepad support is a possibility in the future. Items and tech that alters player physics and movement is an ongoing task.|Player physics and movement|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics11.png) [2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics12.png) [3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics13.png)
Status effects include poison, burning, slow and more. The basic framework for status effects is present, some work needs to be completed on their visual representation. e.g the player/npcs giving off flames whilst burning.|Status Effects|100%
Items and tools include anything a player can wield. A full and extensible item system is ready for use, and most common tools have been created. There’s still some work to do on specific items and item types however.|Item and Tool usage|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics31.png) [2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics32.png) [3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics33.png) 
Character creation is complete, though we may add additional options in the future. You can test out a web based version of the character creator on www.playstarbound.com|Character Creation|100%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/playermechanics41.png)
**Core Mechanics**|
Collision is complete and has been tested as working as expected up to ridiculous speeds. Some minor bugs with lip jumping that need to be sorted out.|Physics / Collisions|100%|
Protocol is functional, but in constant flux as we add/remove/change various features. Protocol is not yet versioned, so using old versions of the client can cause errors.|Network Protocol|90%|
Entities are tracked irrespective of their type. Their interface is unified to accept basic management commands. Moreover, they can also be queried by type. This simplifies code maintenance.|Entitiy Querying &amp; Management|90%|
Differences between base generated state and current state are stored in a custom coded B-Tree based database and serializes to a file.|Low level world/entity storage|90%|
**User Interface**|
The crafting interface is functional and powerful, however work needs to be done on the information it displays to show you the stats of the item you’re crafting. The cooking window is complete.|Crafting/Cooking|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/crafting.png)
Health, hunger and temperature bars are complete including unique behaviours from each depending on the players situation.|Health/Hunger/Temperature|100%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/hunger.png)
The inventory window is complete minus a couple of bugs that need to be smoothed out.|Inventory|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/inventory.png)
The party window has been designed and the graphics are available, awaiting implementation.|Party|20%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/party.png)
The tech window has been designed and the graphics are available, awaiting implementation.|Tech|20%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tech.png)
The chat window is in and functional, additional functionality for whispering/world/universe chat need to be added as tabs to this interface.|Chat|70%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/chat.png)
Travel destinations are selected via a Starmap, which is largely complete. There is room however to add some transition animations and some UI sounds. The fuel UI is complete, some items need their fuel values reconfigured.|Travel/Fuel UI|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/planetarysystem.png) [2](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/sectorspace.png) [3](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/objectmoon.png)
Tooltips appear on every item, giving you a description or stats. This is mostly complete, though a few items need special stats to appear in these tooltips.|Tooltips|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/tooltips.png)
Investigation is complete (minus one bug fix).|Investigation|100%|
The log UI has been designed and is awaiting implementation. A large number of documents, lore books, letters, etc have been produced to fill the log book.|Log|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/log1.png)
The hotbar is complete, though discussion on a slot dedicated to weaponry is taking place.|Hotbar|100%|
**Server Stuff**|
Allows party formation, party chat, invitations to other players ships, PVP, mission instances and more. Some of the base work on 'teams' is done, including teams for NPCs, allowing for NPCs to fight amongst themselves. However most of the work here is interface work that has yet to begin.|Party mechanics|20%|
Needed for effective moderating, for parties, for anti-tampering with secure servers.|Unique player IDs/Storage|40%|
Needed for rate limiting, for ultra fast movement detection and auto moderation, for cooldown violation, for hitbox tampering and other client side hacks. Need to move some things to server for security’s sake.|Security / Anti Cheat|20%|
Everything an IRC server has. Multiple channels, muting, banning, group chatting, broadcast messages, identification and authentication by password and/or by user key, forced nick changing, klining, banning by IP or client fingerprint. User whitelists. User permissions in the form of Access Control Lists or IRC Flags.|Admin Tools|20%|
**Items**|
Melee weapons are fully generated, stats such as swing speed, damage per hit, range, class and more are configured dynamically. Each melee weapon is given a generated graphic and name. We would like the way the weapon is used to differ per class a bit more and are currently adding additional mods, such as flaming weapons.|Melee weapon generation|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/melee.png)
Gun weapons are fully generated, stats such as shot speed, shot damage, energy consumption, level, and more are configured dynamically. Each gun is given a generated graphic and name. A good first set of projectile mods has been produced allowing the different classes of guns to shoot many different things.|Gun generation|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/gun.png)
A large number of projectiles have been produced and plugged into gun generation. Explosive weapons need to carry over their damage to their explosion and adding some additional options to projectile configuration will allow for an even wider array of projectiles to be produced.|Projectiles|70%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/projectile.png)
Block code is very much complete, blocks have a wide variety of settings, this includes their health, their physics, transparency, value and so on. There is little to no code required to finish up blocks, only a few more materials need to be added, this will continue to be expanded post release.|Blocks|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/blocks.png)
Object code is very much complete, objects have a large number of settings that allow us to create almost any object in minutes. Though some objects with special uses do need lua scripts written for them.|Objects|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/fountain.png)
Consumable code is complete and a large number of consumables exist already, this includes items the player can eat, drink or otherwise use a single time. Additional consumable effects need to be added, buffs/debuffs and so on.|Consumables|70%|
Armor code is largely complete, a large number of armors have been designed. Many of them are already in the game, others are being added slowly as we work on larger tasks.|Armors|70%|
Vehicles items will beam down a vehicle from the players ship that alters the players physics and movement. Mechs and hoverbikes have already been designed and animated. Implementation on those has not yet started however.|Vehicles|20%|
**Universe Generation**|
The Universe is divided into sectors, each sector contains a huge number of solar systems. Sector generation, solar system generation, planet generation and orbiter generation systems are complete. We may add more features to this, however, as well as the ability to insert hard-coded systems and special areas as we progress.|Universe / Sector Generation|90%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/sector.png)
A large number of biomes are present and content complete. There is always room to add additional trees, bushes, plants, and completely new biomes. We’ll be constantly adding these post release.|Biome Content|90%|
We have a number of mini biomes per larger biome, these biomes need to be given unique drops and more of a purpose. Though they do currently provide a nice level of variety.|Mini Biomes|60%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/minibiome.png)
The world generation code is capable of choosing biomes, terrain shapes, temperature, liquids, weather, ore distribution, underground layers, cave structure and more. However these elements need to be tied to the planet’s level to create an overall difficulty.|World-level parameter gen|70%|
Planet art is generated to appear beneath the players ship when the player is in orbit. The planet art matches the biome present on the planet as well as the planet’s dominant liquid. The travel animation from planet to planet / solar system to solar system needs to be smoother. |Star / Planet orbital rendering|80%|[1](http://playstarbound.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/orbit.png)
World storage is largely complete, though may require additional work when new features are added. World bookmarking isn’t in yet and will become part of the Starmap. |World bookmarking, storage|80%|

And I'm not talking about cute little twinkling Terraria stars I'm talking like a fiery ball of death from the sky. I know Terraria had the meteor that would crash and you could mine it but I'm thinking more of a destructive thing than for rare minerals. And they could potentially land on your structures and cause massive damage. Which could open up the door for some neat defensive shield type thing. Like a generator that you could have and it would project a barrier around your structures and/or a small area. This could be something that could also just be specific to certain planets. Since the planets are ranked in level from 1-100 maybe around level 70-75 you start to encounter harsher environments including meteors falling on the planet. That way you don't get totally owned on your first few planets. Or it could even be constrained to specific astroids as I know there's speak of being able to land on those as well.

Anyways I still really like the idea of a shield generator, it could be run off of batteries since I know there's going to be batteries in the game. Which also would give you reason to maybe switch it on/off when needed. So if you're off exploring and a meteor shower starts you'd have to rush back and flip your shield on to protect your house. It could also serve to protect from the possible lava rain in the game as well. 

I whipped up a quick idea of how they'd overlap when used in paint, nothing fancy.

Personally, I've known about this game for several months already and I've been getting even more excited for it as time goes on.  So, I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this matter.  Obviously, since it hasn't been confirmed, we can't say with certainty one way or the other, but I was hoping that maybe someone with more knowledge on the matter or previous experience with making a game, might be able to give their view on the matter.

Some time after I heard about Starbound and I thought my dreams would come true.

But there is the thing: instead of just water and lava, it could have some other types of liquids, such as oil, gas (liquid when under pressure), ""quicksand"", mud (swamp biomes and such) and also poisoned water.

- Oil and gas (which would slowly escape from ""open spaces"") could be used as fuel to machines, torches and other things;

- Quicksand, needless to explain;

- Mud would be cool, like harder to ""swin"" and slowing you down;

- Poisoned water would act just like water but would deal damage if you swin on it or drink it.

**But Triarch! How would we do this?**

We will already be able to set a homeworld. All you need to do to found your empire is build a capitol building on your homeworld and have several communities be signatories to an imperial charter.

**But doesn't that seem too easy? Any noob can make an empire right off the bat!**

Here's the hard part. The capitol building has to be of a sufficiently large size, and needs to have several hard-to-find materials incorporated in its construction.

There are multiple ways to make communities be signatories to the charter. One is to form an alliance with them. This usually isn't easy. Another is to kill their leader so they surrender. While killing the leader is much easier, forming an alliance with communities heavily pays off in the long run.

**So what about the charter?**

All it basically does is incorporate your empire. At the signing, you and the other signatories will iron out the specific wording of the charter. Once everyone comes to an agreement and signs, voila! You have your own interplanetary empire!

**Okay, I'll bite. So what are the advantages of an empire?**

* The signatories will now serve you, which means you can order them to do certain things, like gather a specific resource, or build things. This is good for getting massive quantities of stuff.

* You can add new communities and planets to your empire whenever you want. To claim an uninhabited planet, just put your flag on it. To add new communities, just get them to be another signatory to the charter.

* You can make your own army, which will defend the empire and conquer requested targets. Individuals from the imperial communities, non-sentient robots, mercenaries, prisoners of war, and slaves can be part of the army, with varying degrees of effectiveness based on experience and status.

* You can appoint imperial officials, who can be used to automate parts of your empire.

* You don't even have to run your empire if you don't want to! Just appoint a leader to lead it for you. If you ever want to take back control of your empire, just fire them.

**This sounds way too good to be balanced. What are the disadvantages?**

* The empire needs to be defended from danger. This includes rival empires, natural disasters, and revolutions. You can deal with these yourself, or have your army do it for you.

* Signatories need to be kept happy (or sufficiently oppressed). If they aren't happy (or sufficiently oppressed), their orders won't be carried out as well. If they're very unhappy (or barely oppressed), you run the risk of them seceding or revolting.

* Building an army takes a massive amount of resources. Early on, it'll probably be better to deal with problems yourself.

* Only certain people can be imperial officials. This includes community leaders and certain other NPCs. You can also have other players as officials.

* If you appoint a leader to lead your empire for you, you can't do anything regarding your empire while they're in office. After all, they're taking care of that for you!

I remember reading something a long while back saying there was more or less an infinite number of planets to explore, all randomly generated. However, more recently with the information about the starmap and navigation an infinite universe seems a bit less likely.

Also, my understanding is that the entire universe is essentially identical for every single player, in fact I remember Tiy mentioning that they haven't decided if the items held in chests should be the same for everyone, which implies that the planets are identical down to the location of chests.

So what I'm really curious about is this, if the universe is not infinite and the planets are the same for everybody, do you feel that would detract from the excitement of exploration at all? I know playing games like minecraft and terraria I've always loved the thought that the world I'm playing in has never been experienced by another individual.

Another question that relates back to the last one, does every player begin the game in the same location within the universe, because if so than I think that will hurt the replayability a bit because you'll be so familiar with all of the planets near the spawn. It would also make me worry about larger population multiplayer servers cleaning out all of the resources on planets close to the spawn.

Here I am worrying that the universe isn't big enough, even though I probably won't be able to explore 1% of all the planets in my lifetime.

A strong modding community for a game adds tremendously to it's popularity and lifespan. Mods fill niche roles, adding things too obscure or complex for game devs to add, but that nevertheless are in high demand by a small portion of the game's community. A highly modded game is more than the sum of it's parts, take minecraft for instance. An enormous pool of mods has allowed minecraft to branch from rollplaying to hardcore PVP to creative building and much more, all from a vanilla game that wouldn't easily facilitate any of those game modes otherwise. The modding community has made minecraft what it is today.  

So comes Starbound. We all know how many amazing features are being supported from launch, but it's still only a single game, the same set of features for everyone. The ability to craft the game into your own perfect experience with mods, be it creative, rollplaying, or hardcore PVP, or something totally different, makes the game, again, more than the sum of it's parts. 

If you find yourself with a bit of free time, I'd suggest that you watch the following [TED Talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce.html). It describes the revelation in the foods industry, that perfect products don't exist, because everyone has their own personal opinion on what makes a product perfect. Similarly, as great as this game is looking to be, no set of vanilla features will be perfect from everyone's perspective. The diversifying effect of mods on a game and it's community is wonderful, and makes everyone's experience better. 

---

As someone interested in modding Starbound, I'd also love to know what mods the community is interested in seeing. I'd be personally interested in porting some of the big minecraft plugins over to Starbound such as Factions. What do you want?

A. Your first chance to play Starbound will be when the beta launches later this year, preordering will ensure you're one of the first to play it.

**Q. Which platforms will the game support?**
A. Windows, Mac and Linux!

**Q. How many tracks are included in the Soundtrack?**
A. The preorder includes two soundtracks, the Starbound Soundtrack that contains 24 tracks and the Starbound Experimental Soundtrack that contains an additional 40. We will be adding additional tracks over time!

**Q. Does my purchase include a steam key?**
A. Yup! When the game appears on steam we'll send a steam key out to everyone that has purchased the game thus far.

**Q. How come you're doing this Kickstarter style?**
A. We're financing the game out of our own pocket and a couple of our team members have had to take on second jobs. We're hoping the preorder will allow them to work full time on Starbound and get the game to you quicker!

**Q. What if you don't get enough preorders, will the game be unfinished?**
A. No, the Starbound is going to make it out in 2013 no matter what. But by preordering you help it get here even faster.

**Q. Will I be notified when the game is available?**
A. Yes! We'll send you an email when the beta is ready to download and when a steam key is available.

**Q. How will I get access to the game, game keys and other rewards once they are ready?**
A. When you complete your purchase, we will prompt you for an email address which we will use to notify you when your rewards are ready. We are also hard at work on an account system where you will be able to log in and see your purchases and get access to beta downloads and steam keys when they are ready. This account system may also be used for other in-game features. Stay tuned!

**Q. Are there any rules when it comes to naming NPCs?**
A. Only a few obvious ones, nothing vulgar, nothing under copyright or trademark and it can only consist of letters, no symbols.

**Q. How does weapon design work?**
A. We'll email you asking how you'd like the weapon to look and how you'd like it to function and we'll work with you to make sure the gun looks good and fits nicely into the rest of the game.",,False,self,t5_2tkp6,False,,hylotl,True,t3_1c8sc4,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/1c8sc4/starbound_preorder_faq_in_case_the_website_is/,

I remember reading somewhere (Maybe the recent IRC interview with Tiy?) that, rather than saving worlds in their entirety like Minecraft does, Starbound will save worlds by their ""differences"" from what the procedurally generated world is like change-free.  

So, say you go to a world.  You destroy a single block of dirt, and build a tiny house.  The game doesn't save the entire planet, but rather it saves the information that you destroyed a dirt block, and built a small house, and procedurally generates the rest of the world the same as before.  That's how I understand it.  

So my question is, what happens when one of the weekly content patches does something to update terrain generation?  Wouldn't this screw up any previous saves, since the terrain itself isn't saved, just the differences?  Will we find our bases suddenly inside a mountain, or floating above a chasm?

Now my idea is for a human dungeon whether it is be a bandit lair or a lair of space pirates on a nondescript planet and can even be as advanced as an abandoned military base carefully guarded by robots. These human dungeons would consist of basic level space age tech. Blaster pistols, basic armor, low tech schematics, etc. Then escalate to even more advanced tech allowing you to find blaster rifles, energy blades, military grade armor, and high level schematics, etc.  I honestly don't know how it would work but it just seems unfair that there are never any human based dungeons in games that allow for more than one race. What are your guys' thoughts on a possible human dungeon.

Even if these non-wood trees only appear on high level planets it means you'll have to bring along a bunch of wood.


On the other hand if metal trees and weird alien trees all give you wood it wont make much sense.

I've asked this before on the IRC, but i don't think anyone understood what I meant. It basically involves save files.

So, when you start a new game (universe), you haven't been anywhere. You haven't made any changes, so the save file won't contain much. However, all of the randomly generated planets are technically already there, as each universe will be identical (typing the same seed will always give you the same co-ordinates.

My question is what happens after you have visited a planet? Does the game then create a save for that planet in the save file? Loading the planet the next time you visit from the seed generator would be incorrect, as you may have made changes. 

I am wondering how big the file would get if you spent an hour changing 1 block on as many planets as you can (for the sake of science!). Suddenly, those 50 changed tiles would make the save file hugely bigger?

Of course the devs are more than welcome to come in and offer input, give reasons, defend their decisions, and convince us of the design if they wish. But I want to emphasize that the goal of this post is not to make or suggest that the devs alter the plan for the game. It is *their* game. No matter what we end users want in our experience, they are more than entitled to flesh out their dream and concepts in the way they seem fit. Now onto the discussion.

I was really excited when I saw the procedural generation in the game. Especially with how good it looks so far (really really great job guys. You deserve some massive credit). And I have a list of pros that I saw for the randomization:

* Wide variety of environments can be easily made and experienced in a different order in each game. This will lead to creative structures based on resources and tiles you have available, and a drive to explore to find more resources you want.

* Cool enemies and a fresh experience on each world. Especially with the art on them, different wildlife in different environments. Should be very cool.

* The randomizability (lol that's a word now) of the engine does a nice job of emphasizing the infinite universe with unlimited combinations of outrageous environments. Very good for extended play late game.

But after thinking about this, I realized that this could be a huge detriment to the game. And I've seen it with other games that emphasize random generation almost just for the sake of random generation (I have been guilty of it on some Ludum Dare projects and other things). The game loses it's sense of design.

Think about it. Terraria had such a concise experience that directly benefited from the design. There were always base level enemies (slimes) that served a purpose even when you outleveled them. Now you might only see things your level. Each enemy was designed with a specific behavior in mind. They didn't just attack with their randomly assigned stats, their behavior was a part of their difficulty. Especially with 1.1 content, the new enemies were tough especially with the new behaviors they had. But now what if my planet generates enemies that are all quadrupeds and have the same basic attack, even with their beefed up stats, they won't be any more challenging than stuff I had on my first planet, they'll just do more damage. The design of the progression of enemies led directly to how weapon progression balanced against them. It was all a feat of design and testing that led to the whole experience and I'm afraid that the procedural generation will cause a loss of some of the game's cohesive and purposeful feel.

Will there be galaxies? Within galaxies star clusters, binary and multiple star systems? And then planets/moons/asteroids with proper orbits? Basically like in the real world.

They land onto your head and (depending on the virorb) give you some really unique debuffs/status conditions.

But the problem is, it feels like a minor waste if tons of debuffs like that are only on one virorb that really rarely spawns. I'm fine with quite a few of them being unique to these virorbs, but there should be multiple enemies that freeze/poison/etc.

One possible solution would to give tons of pre-generated bosses and enemies the ability to land some of these debuffs, but I think it'd be better to have some be randomly generated.

Basically, from what I understand, when a monster is randomly generated it's determined somewhat like: body type, then arms, legs, and head (same time?), then whether or not it has wings, then stats.

We could either add another step in there: body type, limbs+head, wings or not, elemental attribute, then stats*. If an elemental attribute is added, there will be minor appearance changes to show this. For fire, the enemy would have certain things about it on fire. It wouldn't matter whether it's just fists or the tip of a tail, or its entire back and head, as long as players notice it often. This would be determined much like ""should this have wings?"" is determined. I guess you wouldn't see many elemental winged enemies. It'd also be nice if fire-elemental enemies were more often speedier enemies, and subtle touches like that. Not entirely sure how you'd reliably show Toxic, Freezing, etc.

*Alternative: Decide on whether or not it's elemental and what element before anything else, then its coloration and stuff can be based off of that. You should still be able to tell a regular red-orange enemy from a fiery red-orange enemy, though.

Another possible idea would be to program a few new main bodies, limbs, etc., that have elemental appearances. Such as body parts made of fire, magma, ice crystal, snow, sludge, and so on. Any monster randomly generated with body parts like that gets those elemental attributes (might want to have the generator refuse to give the monster limbs of different elements though, that might get odd).



Even if randomly-generated enemies are elemental only 5% or 1% of the time, I think it'd make a big difference overall. Thoughts?",,False,self,t5_2tkp6,False,,glitch,True,t3_12k1yv,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/12k1yv/elemental_attributes_on_randomlygenerated_monsters/,

I just wanted to share some of my thoughts on the game so far, and talk about the live stream that ended a couple hours ago.

Now, for those of you who missed it, it was a lot of fun. I missed the first half hour (not too happy about that!), but what I saw was awesome. Tiy tried to stay away from big spoilers for the game, and kept a lower level character throughout the stream, and had relatively simple items (he was also dressed like a pirate). 

From what I saw from the stream, the game looked relatively stable. There were few glitches that I noticed, though the new music features obviously need to be finely tuned, obviously. When I entered the fray, Tiy was in a pretty bland looking world in which he built a wooden cabin. The building was definitely Terraria-esque. Once it was finished, he added some furniture (wood) and doors (wood).

Afterwards, he took us back up into orbit, showing us the Avian respawn sequence (a chick walking around and morphing into an Avian). The respawn sequence definitely needed work, as it was completely soundless. The Avian ship looked quite nice, and he took us to a couple new planets. 

What really excited me was seeing the FTL jump into hyperspace, which was extremely well animated and looked pretty awesome. Much to my chagrin, Tiy was very candid with the things he wanted to show us. He did, however, show us many new creatures that were, honestly, interesting but forgettable. 

My highlight of the stream was the airship. When Tiy took us to the second planet, there was a huge anchor on the solid earth that extended upwards out of sight. Everyone in the live chat was freaking out and asking him what it was, and soon the consensus was that it was a mario-styled airship. Tiy passed it and fought some monsters that were too high level for him, then played some music while walking back.

Apparently, the chat was getting too boisterous with every asking Tiy to go up to the airship (my self included), and Tiy agreed to show us the bottom part. He spawned himself a bunch of platforms to attach to the anchor, and started going up. After quite a while, he finally made it up.

What I  saw was indeed a Mario-styled airship with many crates and chests, along with torches and the such. Tiy refused to show us andy more, which I respect but am saddened by. I asked Tiy in the chat whether you could open up the crates (On a tangent here for a second, why the hell would a developer add containers into a game that you can't open, that is my absolute video game pet peeve), and to my great pleasure he replied to my chat ingame, and said you could indeed open crates.

Sorry if this is long and rambling, by the way. I can add a TL;DR:

**TL;DR   -   Tiy showed us an airship, the jump to hyper speed, and messed around with music for a while.** *

Really excited for this game, recently read The Culture novels (which are fantastic if you like this kind of scifi stuff btw) and I can't wait to start building worlds based on that.


At the end of a stream Legris said that he's amazed that the server's not dead, that made me curious what sort of scale testing have you done to verify that your engine / netcode can support the types of servers that you want it to, I remember reading about having factions etc on servers, do you know if the bandwidth/cpu reqs on the serverside when this type of thing is going on? If it even starts to strain on a single world, how many worlds can even a high end commercial server run at once? I'd guesstimate &lt; 20 before it gets laggy when action is going on in all of them. How many players can a single world support?


The nature of the game having a ton of smaller isolated environments lends itself to having different sections of the galaxy on different servers and replicating the db. Then server owners could band together and form large clusters of players/planets without killing their bandwidth/individual servers. Too many players to handle on server a? Balance the load to server b.


I'd be really interested to see how far the engine can be pushed, so far we've seen a fairly sparse amount of things onscreen at once, can it handle huge multilevel cities with a ton of npcs etc
Couple of other question if you have time, if you can't tell I have a PvP slant (love exploring with my friends in hardcore minecraft servers knowing we could horribly die at any moment )


Are there any plans to have an (armed?) shuttle/ship that you can ""land"" / hover close to the ground on a planet, teleporting is awesome but there's something very cool about having to take a shuttle down to a surface, maybe you have to tech up/power the teleport so it's a resource drain making you consider if you need to use it. For me a large part of excitement in games like this are when you don't feel safe/about to lose a lot, being able to teleport off of the surface anytime would make PvP for example a little less interesting.


Will there be a way to make a ground base that can withstand a fair attack? For example blocks that can take a beating, shields (that need power and can be overwhelmed, can only be passed if you have a carryable item with a specific code, so you can make a group), auto/player controllable turrets etc (that don't fire on someone with the same item+code)? What about other things such as surface to surface (or subsurface) teleport platforms? Maybe even auto mining rigs + mineral scanners etc. Stuff like that seems like a great reason to need to build significant tech on a planet surface.


Speaking of which will there be some mechanism to track players across worlds (with perhaps a percentage chance of losing them everytime they change locations)? I'd love a tracking device or some such so that someone can't just beam away and totally prevent pursuit, also will there be a way to temporarily disrupt another player leaving a planet?


What level of tech are you hoping to climb to? Are we talking just ""really powerful guns"" or demi-god level local time slowing field augmentations/planet crackers? Also even when you get said tech, does it just get powered infinitely? I wonder if having to create /gather some sort of energy to power devices means that even when you get the end level stuff it doesn't feel like the end, you still have to generate energy somehow to power your faction/4 man groups powerful gear, either through gathering rare energy sources or slower but safer reactors etc. Part of the problem when you get to the end of a tech tree in games is the feeling that there's nothing else to work for. Having to power stuff may sound annoying but it's something to work together for and makes the end level stuff feel that more awesome.


Do you have plans for wireable fluid pumps so we can play with the awesome fluid engine? How bout a tool that can suck up/redistribute fluids.


Speaking of reactors, what are your thoughts on buildings that aren't prefabricated, for example some sort of reactor that requires water to be pumped to a central chamber (plus having some sort of lockdown mechanism triggered by lever if it starts going critical _). I think things like that would be a great use of both the setting and building elements in the game, plus the tutorial could be encountering them already built.

Let me explain. First I'd like to say that I'm super excited for Starbound. I like Terraria, sci-fi, cyberpunk and the like, and I think Starbound will be an amazing spiritual successor to Terraria.

With that said - I played Minecraft before I played Terraria. A friend of mine had a really difficult time convincing me that I'd like it. I hadn't played a 2D platformer in a long time, but I tried it and I loved it. Terraria certainly has its intense moments, but something I missed, that 3D games can do very well (Minecraft included), is the ability for enemies to sneak up behind me. Having the character in the middle of the screen with the entire screen visible kind of ruins that feeling of paranoia that I get.

A cone of vision crossed my mind at first, which is shite because then you'd be looking at a screen that's 60% blank (then I experienced Doom 3 flashbacks). I thought about Super Mario Brothers where Mario is close to the left edge of the screen while the rest of the screen displays what's ahead of him, which is probably too little seeing as how Mario 1 only scrolled to the right. I don't know how many sidescrollers handle this, but I was thinking having the character off-center at 1/4 or 1/3 of the screen, adjusting left aligned or right aligned, might add to the experience.

After building a village you would be able to call in NPCs to live there, and work. When calling them you're able to customize them just as you would creating a character.

1. Market management.

After setting up shop, and putting everything you want to sell in a container, you can have an NPC manage the shop for you at all times, so players visiting can purchase stuff you found.

2. Defense. 

Equip an NPC with weapons and armor and have him/her fight off mobs near your village.


If they don't have a job, they just wonder around.

**Mob and plant control**

Find a cool plant or mob on another planet? Bring the seeds or a couple mobs over to your home planet to populate them.

In thinking about what would make exploring many planets rewarding, among other things the idea of discovering many new creatures came to mind. I assume some will be docile by default, and many others will be aggressive. Discovering creatures will be rewarding on its own, but there are ways I see to enhance this experience.

First, it would be great to be able to tame and collect aggressive and non-aggressive creatures alike. This could be accomplished by simply feeding or otherwise interacting in a certain way with docile animals, and perhaps by building a tranquilizer gun and tranqing aggressive creatures. Maybe you could never tame aggro creatures, but you could at least collect, transport, and perhaps breed them.

Imagine being able to keep an amazing monster, transporting it to another world, and seeing what happens? It would be really fun to experiment, especially if creature interactions were built out. The code for pets is already being made... And what if you find a great creature to use for providing food, and you could transplant them to another world as a food source?

Tranqing might work like you have to inject enough tranquilizer into the creature to put it to sleep, perhaps equal to hit points, and you would also need to have crafted some sort of crate or other device to transport. It could simply just be a matter of taming already docile creatures, but at least allow transport in the spaceship and breeding. I just very much like the idea of being able to collect and transport creatures across planets to allow for experimentation in creature interaction and habitats. You could make a sort of Noah's Ark planet with ALL of the creatures this way. That would be amazing.

A consideration if one could transport a creature... You would also have to be realistic about the creature's survivability in the new habitat. Is it devoid of oxygen? The creature would die. Is it an ice creature on a lava planet? The same. There would need to be realism.

In my mind there is much potential in building out the creature concept in this way. I would point to the success of Pokémon, Animal Crossing, etc. People love animals.",,False,self,t5_2tkp6,False,,,True,t3_1jskg1,http://www.reddit.com/r/starbound/comments/1jskg1/a_vision_for_creature_interaction/,

I think the best way to do this would be to start a Steam group.

I know minecraft has had loads of time to get so popular, and we can't expect starbound to be installed on everyone's computer on the first day it's released, but maybe something smaller wouldn't be so... ambitious. I just think it would be nice for us to have a server where we could all come together to set things on fire or have an expedition or build ridiculously big buildings. I understand one does not simply house all of reddit on their laptop, but maybe if a few of us made servers for, let's say, 10 people each, that could be a start.

From the looks of it, they'll put all the names into some piece of code that will randomly select a name for a NPC, so if you use the same name as someone else, it'll just increase the chances of seeing it probably.
