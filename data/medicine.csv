1370150206.0,390,self.medicine,1fi7mr,My Primary Care Experience,SacInternist,438,48,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1fi7mr/my_primary_care_experience/,"This is an interesting thread but one that seems to have few actual voices from practicing primary care doctors.  I wanted to add something about my experience to the discussion. 

I am a 43 yo general internist and have been in practice for 15 years in a large multispecialty group practice. I work and live in a metropolitan area with a population of half a million, with another million in the surrounding metro area.  

For the first 10 years of my career I worked on call to the ER a few nights a month and rounded in the hospital a week every 6-8 weeks in addition to running a clinic practice.  I gave this call schedule up voluntarily 5 years ago when I got married and we started to plan kids, as I found sleeping in my bed every night to be increasingly compelling.  Now my work is all clinic based.

My salary, plus bonuses, at this point is 240k, and I do not pay my own malpractice out of this (just taxes, which is enough).  I take every Wed afternoon off (and take a 10% pay cut to do so, this is reflected in my salary above already), but to be honest I spend half of that time catching up on work.  My typical work day is between 10-11 hours, and I do not take lunch.  I also work a few hours every weekend from home to keep caught up. 

Because I work in a large group practice, I do NO insurance paperwork.  Yes, you did read that correctly.  That does not mean I do not have all kinds of BS to put up with, just not that particularly irritating kind.  The BS I do put up with includes all sort of Dilbert-esque level large corporate nonsense, but none that has interfered with what I do inside the exam room. 

My visits with patients are typically 20 minutes.  I carry a panel of about 1900 patients, who vary from homeless people with drug habits to a serving congressman.  Over 85% of the patients I see daily are on my own panel, and many of them I have known for over 10 years.  
As this is a diverse area, I see people with a very wide variety of ethnic backgrounds (including recent Hmong, Russian, Nigerian, and Brittish expats) and use language line phone translation not infrequently during exams. 

In addition to visits, I spend about 2-3 hours a day managing lab results, replying to patient emails, establishing followup plans from hospitalizations, etc.  I also serve on our quality assurance committee (I highly suggest getting involved in this if you can; it is an education in and of itself). 

Since I work in a large group practice where there are no barriers to communication with specialists, I find that the medicine part of my job can be as complex as I want it to be.  I send patients out to see specialists when either I need their expertise or to do a procedure I do not perform.   Often times I collaborate with them via the phone or email,  often times in real time while the patient is in the exam room (video derm consults included here).   

I manage my own heart failure, CAD, asthma, COPD, etc.  I treat a lot of common ailments, but also spend a lot of time working up new complaints. Because my nurses are great, we can handle some things that might go to the ED otherwise (put fluid into the potentially septic patient while waiting on their lactic acid level, for example, or get same day cat scans done with stat labs on a RLQ abdominal pain). 

When word got out my wife was expecting, I received from my patients something like a dozen home made receiving blankets, including ones that (from watching my wife do similar projects) I know must have taken twenty or thirty hours of work to create.  Jokes, inquiries about my family's well being, and other small gifts are common occurrences (and things I greatly appreciate).  The vast majority of my patient interactions are pleasant or downright fun. 

Because I get up early every morning (well, I'm at work at 7:30, so that will not sound early to you poor slobs still in training, sorry!), I am home in time every night to eat dinner with my family, do bath time and story time with my daughter, and spend time with my wife before going to sleep.  If you do not have a family now, believe me, this will be VERY important to you later. 

My undergraduate degree was from an ivy-league school in molecular biology, and I finished in the top 1/3 of my graduating class in medical school.  I initially thought about going into gastroenterology (endoscopy is cool) but lost interest along the way, and did not like the idea of being a trainee for another two or three years after residency.  I have found in no way that my interactions with specialists have left me feeling like a second class citizen; many of them are not just my colleagues, but my patients as well!

Personally, I like my doctoring to be a 50/50 mix of biomedicine and personal interaction, which is why I think primary care works well for me as a career.  Of course I do see tons of colds, and also have repeated the information about colorectal cancer screening so many times it is a loop tape in my head now that I probably mutter in my sleep.  But last week in clinic I also had a new spontaneous pneumothorax (my diagnosis, pulmonary clinic put in the catheter), a new dx of nonsmall cell lung cancer metastatic to the brain in a 42 yo (missed by the ER two days previously, due to her near complete lack of focal neurological findings despite her significant midline shift, a real tragedy for her family), and a follow up appointment with my gent with a thoracic stromal cell tumor (good news, surgeon felt likely to be nonaggressive, we await final immunohistology to find out).  And also saw the patient who has lost 80 lbs in two years without gastric bypass because she listened to me that she needed to get more exercise and stop eating so damn much.  :)

I have no idea how typical or not my personal experience is among primary care doctors nationwide.  Personally I am quite happy to be practicing as a general internist and have no regrets about my decision to not pursue a subspecialty.  

To the medical students and residents reading this forum - I wish you all the best of luck making this choice.  Finding out you picked the wrong specialty after the fact is a hard pill to swallow, but there are certainly worse mistakes you can make in life.  Go investigate your options on your own as vigorously as you can (including getting outside of the academic world) and do not take anyone's word over your own judgement on something this important.

I'm older now and facing difficulties.  My first memory of the medical care world was in the 50's when in a hospital with pneumonia getting shots of penicillin and under an oxygen tent.  In the 60's I had a tonsillectomy and was so angry at my parents for that, but the Dr. really put me at ease.  After that I'd never go to a Dr. much because I didn't really need it except for the Meniere's Syndrome that was diagnosed after many other tests (the Electronystagmography showed it as the cause, early 80's).

I read this and other subreddits and am just taking a moment to say a thanks and hopefully encourage anyone having difficulties in their medical career.  As I see the world there are so many difficulties, both legal, insurance, ethical that you must surely face daily.  Just don't forget the people that you help and have helped.  So thank you all for what you do.

A recent article in the journal for Dutch doctors describes the current protocol for medical abstinence in neonates (premature or not) who will either die shortly or will live a life with extreme handicaps. At the time of this procedure, they have first been resuscitated and kept alive to evaluate their chances of living; and then after careful deliberation and with consent of the parents, the decision to stop treating them has been made. Please, do not think we in the Netherlands kill babies with just Down syndrome or learning disabilities, these really are the very very ill babies who stand no chance in hell to ever live or to ever live without suffering immensely.

It describes how these neonates will be taken off the ventilator and will be left to die, just suffocating. It describes how the doctor should prepare the parents for the gasping of the baby (due to low oxygen) and that this is normal. It describes the use of muscle relaxants in case: 1. the baby looks very unhappy 2. the movements of the baby make holding it by the parents too dangerous (I guess that they will drop the baby) 3. the parents can't stand to see their baby suffocate anymore. 

To my knowledge, these muscle relaxants will then cause the baby to stop breathing completely sooner, because its muscles can't function anymore. In short: you're just making sure the suffocation doesn't take that long.

I ask thee, fellow doctors: why do we not kill these kind of babies in a more merciful way? Why do we not put them in a deep deep coma and then give them muscle relaxants and then take them of the ventilator? 

The, to me idiotic, difference is that in the first case, you are only abstaining from using medical tools (the ventilator), while in the second you are actively ending the life of that baby a bit quicker by giving certain medication before taking the baby off the ventilator. But the end result is completely the same, but without minutes to hours of suffering by that baby. 

Don't tell me a baby can't suffer. I think these babies suffer more than the average animal being slaughtered.

I'm mad at this; and I want to write a letter to the magazine about this, but I don't know how. I'm just a nobody, aren't I? I heard that we, in the Netherlands, are more liberal towards euthanasia than other countries, so I wonder how neonates who are unable to survive are treated in other countries?

   A patient (27, F, Caucasian, no children) complained of intense stomach pains and went to the clinic. Clinic found leukocytes in urine*, assumed UTI. Patient got sulpha-related medication for UTI. Later culture shows no UTI. Patient has itching of the extremities which proceeds into an entire body rash (hot, itchy). Patient then becomes jaundiced. Blood test shows very high bilirubin count, gets admitted to ER. Patient has ultrasound of the liver, no blockage of bile duct detected. Patient does not engage in high risk activities, however she spent 3 years living in Japan (came home August). 

The tests are still ongoing with her. Blood tests don't indicate an allergic reaction occurring. Both the liver cell levels and liver duct levels are high, but duct levels are slightly higher. Bilirubin has remained steady and elevated for the past four days.

What do you guys think it is? The doctors at the hospital are all disagreeing with each other (internal medicine, auto-immune and allergy specialists are involved so far). If any of you guess it correctly, I'll update the original post with the winner. Brainstorm away!

*previously wrote glucocytes, my apologies.

**EDIT: I am compiling all the answered questions into an edit of the OP for ease.**

-Hep tests are coming back today, I'll let you know.

-Conjugated bilirubin is high 

-urine is dark yellow and foams bright yellow when shaken

-Abdo exam came up with no pain or enlargement of liver

-The rash originally resembled petechiae, then formed raised red plaques on the torso

-PT was born with a poorly functioning kidney causing intense pains that were onset at puberty. 70% of kidney was surgically removed in 2003, PT no longer has pains.

-Family history: PTs father had Sarcoidosis (of the lung), sister is allergic to sulfa

I'm currently a CNA in my 2nd semester of nursing school (graduate next May). One of the things that a well-respected instructor told us is a doctor (based on their prior interactions with you) will put you on a ""bright"" or ""not so bright"" list. If a nurse is trusted by a doctor, they are grateful and so appreciative because that's one less thing they have to worry about. The reason she became an instructor is because a doctor explained to her that these schools are cranking out nurses like a factory, and a lot of them book smart, but lack clinical smarts. I want to be the nurse that you can trust. I want you to feel confident in me so that your mind is a bit more at ease while I'm taking care of your patient. So what are some ""no-nos"" you deal with a lot? 

**Edit** I have no idea what the downvotes are for. It's an honest question. This post wasn't to imply that all nurses do stupid things and doctors are perfect. Rather it's a learning opportunity for me as a soon-to-be new nurse. Oh well. Lol

**Edit #2:** Wow, so many great responses! I'm going to link this to my nursing group. I think all new nurses can benefit from knowing some simple, ""common sense"" clinical tasks to be mindful of when entering their first place of employment.

How can I help (to educate) you?,SJhelix,111,21,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1c8pd8/iama_certified_genetic_counselor_how_can_i_help/,"I am a certified genetic counselor, and I specialize in familial and hereditary cancer.

I work in multiple cancer centers and clinics. My role chiefly involves counseling and testing patients, serving on numerous committees, and educating a wide range of physicians (Med/Onc, Hem/Onc, Gyn/Onc, Rad/Onc, GYN, Primary care, GI, Surgery, Pathology, Urology...) on identifying and managing patients at risk for hereditary cancer. 

I played an integral role to get 3 area hospitals to agree to begin screening all newly diagnosed colon cancers for Lynch syndrome. All positive screens are reported to me, and I notify the MDs and then have a consult with the patient. 

I have diagnosed patients with: BRCA, Lynch, FAP/AFAP/MAP, Li-Fraumeni, RB1, Hereditary Diffuse Gastric Cancer, Cowden, MEN1/2A/B, Juvenile polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers, Birt-Hogg-Dube, Von-Hippel-Lindau, and HLRCC syndromes. I help to provide risk management for the patient and their families, and interpret tricky test results. 

If you only take home 1 thing: any family with 3 or more blood related relatives with any combination of breast/ovary/pancreas/prostate cancer, warrants a referral for that family to genetic counseling. 

What do you want to know about (cancer) genetics or genetic testing? How can I help you? Sure, run a case by me. 

The incidence of BRCA is 1 in 400, or 1 in 40 in the Askenazi Jewish population. The incidence of Lynch is estimated to be 1 in 300-400. 

For private inquiries, feel free to send a PM.

Before you all decide what to do with your life I thought I'd share some of the experiences that I had this year as an intern.  I am an internal medicine resident at a well respected academic East coast program known for its humanistic bent. 

Some typical experiences. I have...

-been over my duty hours at least 50% of the time, worked several 100+ hour weeks, been told to keep my mouth shut and me more efficient when I brought it up to my chief,

-stayed awake for six straight days on coffee and 5-hour energy drink because as a night float intern some attendings want you to be present for rounds after your night shift,

-had three separate co-interns endorse suicidal ideation in a single day and had at least one of those be serious (they lived),

-Coded three people in a single early morning, with crying family members in the room, and then got yelled at by an attending for not having my notes finished on time,

-saw a co-intern work with hourly vomiting/diarrhea (because the penalty for missing a day is to be placed first on the sick call list and this generally means missing 1-2 weeks of elective time), then place an IV in his own arm and give himself fluids while writing his notes at the end of a call day,

-been called to sub for a sick intern on my first day off in two weeks (it was a night shift),

-observed a co-intern who had 10 days off in a 4 month stretch of back to back floor months (post night days off count as days off),

-had a nurse not call me for a patient with active GI bleed until the tech noticed that their breath was shallow (Hgb 4.0),

-had a patient yell at me and call me some not-so-nice names for not giving him enough morphine after I recognized a silent NSTEMI on his telemetry and he had to undergo emergent cath,

Some funny things did happen as well. I...

-had a knife drawn on me by a patient in their room,

-had a patient leave the building to shoot heroin through their IV and then come back high,

-had a patient smoke crack in their room,

-had a patient's family member attempt to strangle another family member at the patient's bedside,

-had a constipated guy pass a poop as big as his head (he was a young man).

Lippincott Williams and Wilkins (LWW) is the #2 medical publisher by market share, behind Elsevier. A list of our specialties: 

* Medical Practice - http://imgur.com/XB2pm.jpg
* Nursing - http://imgur.com/yDTN6.jpg
* We also carry a lot of anatomical and disease charts, as well as models of muscles/torsos/skulls/vertebral columns/etc. The product images are way too small to really see the charts (which will be improved soon, I hope). Try looking at our digital catalog - http://www.lippincottcatalog.com

It is difficult to search through the products due to the site design in my opinion, so feel free to ask me questions about what books we have that cover X area or if there is a new book publishing soon in X area or whatever and I'll find you corresponding products. Feel free to PM me anytime if you want anything or are having any issues in any way. 

It seems that a lot of you are residents and would probably like our pocket handbooks.

I am a Wikipedian I am here to try to disprove some ideas about Wikipedia for you and hopefully convince a few of you guys to help with the project.

**Why should I help?**

Wikipedia medical content is viewed by many people every day and accounts for .35% of daily internet usage (again, this is just for the medical content). This amount of traffic makes us bigger than the NIH and WebMD. [(Source)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Chart_of_popularity_of_health-themed_websites_.png) This makes Wikipedia's health content a vital asset to both healthcare profesionals and lay persons alike. What also makes it a vital asset is the fact that it is free and the content can be used in any way you wish. Due to Wikipedia's popularity it needs to have a constant source of people to create, edit, and expand upon its content to make it even better. 

Editing also makes you better at helping you with your daily work or school. When I was in EMT class I was able to help expand articles and I realized that if I was able to write it I was able to remember it. Just remember to leave a citation.

**Who can help?**

Anyone! I started editing before I became an EMT and was able to help improve many medical articles. If you have an interest than you can write about it (just cite where you get your information from!).

**How exactly can I help?**

Find an article that you have some interest in and know a bit about. If you cannot choose an article look over [here](http://tools.wmflabs.org/enwp10/cgi-bin/list2.fcgi?run=yes&amp;projecta=Medicine&amp;importance=Top-Class&amp;quality=C-Class). It is a list of highly important articles that are not as well written as they should be.  Look over it, form an impression of it, and looks for any errors to fix. Feel free to do what ever you want with it honestly (but remember to cite where you got the information). You do not even need an account to start editing! One suggestion I will make though it to click the ""Edit Beta"" button which will enable use of the visual editor which is MUCH easier. Have fun editing and feel free to ask any questions.

We also are looking for translators to help us convert good and featured articles into different languages which do not have such good content. The idea is that we want there to be free and open medical information regardless of where you live.

Pt c/o SOB, general weakness, and dizziness. Pt is initially found to be tachicardic at 120, moderately hypertensive at 185/90, mildly hypoxic at 95% and febrile with a temperature of 100.9^o F. She states her shortness of breath began around noon this morning, and the weakness has been ongoing for 2-3 days now.

While speaking with the patient and her POA, I learned that she had recently come to the emergency room for chest pain, where she was found to have ST elevation, and positive cardiac enzymes. Following diagnosis and administration of morphine, she signed out AMA. Her surrogate relayed the following when I asked why, ""Her husband died several years ago, and she's been very lonely ever since. She's also started to enter the early stages of dementia, and will sometimes forget he's gone, say something to him, and turn to realize he's no longer there. At least twice a week she relives losing him all over again. I don't want you to think she wants to die or something, but she'd rather not delay the inevitable. 

It's happening soon, she knows that, but she just doesn't want it to be painful when it comes. She feels awful for using the ER like that, and so do I, but the last time she was on hospice, she recovered. They couldn't keep a woman with a couple years left in a bed that could be occupied by someone else, and sent her home. She just wants to know what's going to take her, and how to let it take her as peacefully as possible, preferably while she watches the news in John's favorite chair""

After pausing to choke back emotion, I explained what test we would be running, and how I would relay her request to the attending. ""I understand what you want, and I support you entirely. It's your body, and your life, you've lived many years, and I feel you've earned the right to finish your care on your own terms.""

Blood tests and UA lead to a diagnosis of CHF and UTI. When it was suggested that she be admitted, she requested to leave AMA once again. She was prescribed diuretics and antibiotics for home, and advised to take her previously prescribed pain medications as needed.

Edit: 5 year old, alpha 1 anti trypsin deficiency. Cirrhosis, esophageal varices. History of ascites. He had one chest bleed and also an episode of sbp. Most of the time, an extremely normal, healthy kid. He was in kindergarten when we got the call earlier today, so it's bizarre thinking about him being healthy one day and a 10 hour procedure followed by all of the hell the little guy is going to go through afterwards.


Edit 2: The surgery is going to happen. It was pushed to 10:30am pacific time. Spending time together now. Damn, this doesn't feel real at all.

Edit 3: aaaand everything worked out, little man is in surgery as I type. 

Edit 4: He has been in surgery for about 5 hours now, we have received a handful of updates from one of the surgical nurses. Last one was that the old liver is out, and the surgeons were beginning the process of graphing in the new one. Thanks for all of the support you large group of strangers. It has helped me personally being able to just read through and update you guys. 

Edit 5: The surgery was a success, the only side step was having to reroute some parts of his bowel. The surgeons feel very good about the procedure, I'm just waiting for the nurses to let me into the PICU. I'm sure all of the realism will come rushing when I actually see my son, incision, wires, and all.

Thank God for the amazing ICU team at Seattle Children's Hospital. They kicked major ass and saved my sons life. It was a pretty serious resuscitation, but all brain functions are perfect, as well as his other organs.

Edit 8: I think I'm just updating this for continuity now. He improved SO much since yesterday. He was extubated this morning and even just had a bowel movement!

I thought I'd just share my experiences and see what people think. 

*No benefit of the doubt* - This took me a while to get used to, but it seems like my seniors assume the worst - that I'm wasting time or being otherwise unproductive.  If I'm not around or in sight for 15 minutes, I must be texting on the phone and not actually removing a patient's stitches.  I always have to tell them what I'm up to.  This is even true of things that go wrong. They will assume that it's your fault that the labs didn't get ordered unless you tell them exactly what the mix up was.

*Flattery* - Where I was before (research position), flattery can be construed as patronizing and rude.  If I was trying to suck up outside of medicine, they would assume that I was trying to get an unfair edge and it would reflect badly on me.  Not so here, and I'm so unused to that thinking here that I think it's hurt me relative to other students.  I feel so ridiculous when telling them how awesome I think their work is (feel like it should be obvious), but have to anyway.

*Email ettiquette* - short, quick emails seem to be the norm.  Long emails mean you have way too much time on your hands.

*Phone ringing* - no one cares if your phone goes off loudly in the middle of a meeting.  Well, it depends.  But if you miss a call from your senior, well...

*Going the extra mile* - If you stay later/come in earlier, it actually seems to reflect your ""lack of efficiency"" in getting work done rather than your willingness to work hard.  Even doing things that make life easier for a patient really depends on the rotation.  Wrangling a test result from an outside hospital? Great!  You talked to the patient for an extra 20 minutes to comfort her?  What's wrong with you?

*Being quiet* - you're not ""contemplative"", you're just not interested. 


It's still an adjustment, but I feel like a lot of things in medicine go against everything I've learned for 20+ years.

EDIT:
I guess I left out the part that I am doing a lot better now.  Again, it's just an adjustment.

1363639789.0,76,self.medicine,1ajp83,"IMA (nearly) 4th year medical student who is having difficulty with specialty selection and having second thoughts about a career in medicine in general. I am seeking advice, thoughts, or experiences from the good people of /r/medicine.",wampum,97,21,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1ajp83/ima_nearly_4th_year_medical_student_who_is_having/,"So, a little more background:
I am in a US MD program, and thus far, have had a fairly unremarkable track record.  I was middle of the pack for my USMLE step I, had zero honors during my first 2 years (yeah...i know), little substantial research experience/volunteering, and a handful of honors/high passes during my 3rd year.  I have no financial support from my family and have been funding my own education. Despite being one of the lucky few to get a nice scholarship, I will be leaving here with around $100k in debt.

Throughout my training, no specialties have really stood out to me above the rest, though each fell somewhere on the spectrum of intolerable to tolerable.  After much thought, I felt like anesthesia, IM, and emergency seemed like the best options for me (though my exposure to anesthesiology was for only 1 week), but I am going into my 4th year rotation-selection with very little conviction about my would-be career.  Part of me is not convinced that I want the life that a career as a practicing physician seems to offer.   

I am worried because the reasons that I decided to go into this field have been overshadowed by more negative experiences.  The aspects that I enjoy (getting to know patients, medical detective work, saving/changing lives) are a fraction of what has occupied me over the last year of my clinical training.  My ability to focus on the positives is dwindling and I am becoming overwhelmed by the hours/lack of sleep, the pressures around documentation/CYA, the highlighted systemic shortcomings, and the social exhaustion I feel from working from the bottom of the totem pole in a rigid hierarchical system.  

I watch the residents cope with their indentured servitude and see them struggle to pay for child-care that can accommodate their extreme hours. One intern guiltily remarked that he hadn't seen his kids in the last month because he is always gone before they awake and home after they are asleep.  I've watched marriages crumble, residents bitterly complain about how the maternity leave for one of their co-residents was forcing them to pick up the slack, and heard a new female attending (in her early 30s) anxiously describe how she feels obliged to continue to delay having children because the effects that it may have on her new practice. I recognize that this is in the setting of me being a male third-year, having no children (or even a willing incubator, for that matter), and practicing ""diet-doctoring,"" with significantly fewer patients/paperwork/responsibility. To top it off, I am rarely even reaching 80 hour/week duty hours.  

So... I am likening myself to a guy who is complaining of blisters during the first mile of an ultra-marathon.  Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?  Or is my training designed to increase my comfort in knowing that I am not in a tunnel, rather on a never-ending subterranean highway, and I should be grateful that I may go from 80 hr/wk to 60?  

So, are there any anesthesiologists, IM docs, ED docs willing to talk about their careers, and the factors they weighed most heavily in deciding on specialty to select?  Are there any medical people who have had cold feet during their training?  Anybody out there who took the debt from getting an MD degree but didn't pursue a residency or clinical practice?

TL;DR: Naive MS3 whines about medicine, is undecided about his career, and wants to hear from meddit about cold-feet and career selection. 

Edit: typos

Edit #2:  I wanted to thank everyone for their support and advice.  I cannot describe how meaningful it has been for me to read these comments.  It reminds me that one of the greatest things about this field is how it selects for so many smart and genuinely nice people.  Again, thank you all so much, and I am grateful to be part of an online sub-community that is filled with such kind and insightful members.

I have to confess that I'm positively bored. Since my training, years ago, I cannot say that anything I do is much of a challenge, and the cases I see are all about the same. On top of this, a large segment of physicians here are old guard who haven't updated their medical knowledge in 30 years, and who practice malpractice medicine without a lawsuit daily. I'm one of the few who recognizes this, so that even if I wanted to do something more innovative than the Stone Age, most would look at me like I was a lunatic. I've tried to make use of this time by learning new procedures, and expanding my knowledge and practice, but it doesn't matter because I can never utilize anything I learn. Unfortunately, my lowly pedigree prevents me from getting employment at an academic center, and it's not for lack of trying. Lately, I'm finding it especially difficult to even fake taking anything that happens at the hospital seriously. I should be more enthusiastic, because we recently became a mostly closed ICU. But I haven't seen a great change, least not the kind I expected. 

So that's all. It was something I wanted to get off my chest. 

EDIT: thanks for all the advice. The most important thing is just to get satisfaction outside of work. A job is a job. It's not my life. 

EDIT 2: it turns out that my department has surreptitiously acquired an ultrasound long ago but didn't tell anybody about it because no one has been ""in-serviced.""  Starting this week, there will be in-service presentations from the company rep on how to use it. Apparently this in-service applies to everyone, so that even the mid-levels are required to bone up on it. I have no idea what's expected of us, as I'm one of a minority of people who has any skill in using it. It seems the idea is that any deficiencies by others is to be corrected by having the skilled practitioners teach others.

Longtime lurker, and I need your advice.

From a young age I have always had a fascination with programming/web design and startups. I taught myself some web design and was hoping to pursue those fields as careers. Due to familial pressures and my lack of a spine at the time, I went the medical route.

Through pre-med and now the beginning of the 4th year of medical school, I've tried to suppress those interests, to really, really force myself to find the beauty in medicine. I *love* the problem-solving aspect of it, but that's about it. I cannot stand patient interaction, dealing with nurses and staff, etc. It isn't for me. And medicine just does not offer the creative outlet I'm looking for. Because of that, I've managed to do web design on the side for the past few years.

So here I am with 1 year to go. I'm planning to apply for residency because why not, but I know in my heart it just isn't what I want to do. I'd much rather get into the business side of health companies, strategy or marketing, or create my own health startup. I have very basic programming skills, and am proficient in front-end development and visual/ux design, but I have no other marketable credentials, and my other skills are hardly what you'd call at an expert level. I don't want to spend 12+hrs a day in the hospital doing something I'm not enjoying, yet at times it feels as if I don't do residency, it'll be the end of the world, especially with the debt I've racked up.

What options are there for MDs that want to jump ship after medical school? Are any of you out there who found yourselves in similar situations? Anyone out there forgo residency to pursue a deeper interest?

Thanks in advance.

One thing that struck  me as interesting is that though many patients were diabetic (we were in the 'diabetes capital of India'), they were all 'normal' or 'underweight' in terms of BMI. How could this be?

One of the physicians I shadowed provided a theory of his: In Indian culture, women often eat the last and the least, saving food for the men in the family. This happens even when the woman is pregnant. However, once the baby is born and especially if it is a boy, it is fed a lot of food and grows into a relatively tall adult. For whatever reason, they stayed skinny throughout their lives.

The Dr. suggested that when a pregnant woman is undernourished, her child will have underdeveloped organs, including a pancreas. However, when the child is born, it is fed copious amounts of food so that he (especially he, in this case) will grow strong, etc. The male grows 'too large for his pancreas', effectively, and eventually the pancreas gives out in young adulthood even though he is not overweight.

I thought this was really interesting, but I could not find any information on how valid this statement is. Would anyone like to share their thoughts?",,False,,t5_2qhff,False,,,True,t3_1jmsl7,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1jmsl7/interesting_theory_posed_by_a_physician_i/,

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice or just want an outlet and r/medicine is the most applicable place. I’m just feeling kinda disparaged by a few things

**Tests** – After a year and a half, I cannot seem to figure out how to score well. It’s not like I’m failing, and I know grades aren’t the most important thing in the world, but it’s still discouraging. Moreover, it feels like I’m preparing to simply regurgitate facts. I find myself missing the days of orgo/math/econ where you had 2-3 hours to solve 5-10 questions. You really needed to think your way through problems. Now it feels like you just recognize buzzwords as fast as possible.

Don’t get me wrong, there are many things I find fascinating. For example, the pathophysiology of coarctation of the aorta. How it occurs distal to the 3 main aortic branches, leading to HTN in the upper extremities and hypotension in the lower extremities. But I can also tell you that while S aureus is the leading cause of osteomyelitis, Salmonella should be suspected in sickle cell patients. However, I couldn’t tell you WHY this is. It’s just a disparate fact without explanation. Any reasonably intelligent person could have memorized this. For whatever reason, this feels unsatisfying. And most of what we learn seems to fall in the latter camp. 

**Work Ethic** – As ridiculous as it may sound, medical school is without a doubt the laziest period of my life. I graduated magna cum laude from a good university. I played sports, volunteered, worked during breaks, and led a more active social life. Now, I have literally 0 extracurricular responsibilities and I’m putting in less time and effort at school. It’s not like I’m going out with friends or drinking or doing fun things. I just dick around on reddit or play videogames. I feel guilty, but I can’t be bothered to put in a consistent effort. 

**Clinical Skill** – As far as I can tell, most patients find me pleasant. Regardless of the actual interview, the standardized patients generally give me high marks for being receptive to feedback and working on ways to improve. That being said, I’m finding out that I’m a pretty shitty historian. I never seem to be able to answer an attending’s follow-up questions, either because I didn’t elicit the information or I don’t understand his/her line of thinking. Furthermore, many of my HPIs and complete histories have been torn apart. It’s never been humiliating, but there’s definitely a sentiment of “You’ve got a ways to go, kid.” It’s one thing that the science isn’t clicking, especially when I know I could be working harder. But when you can’t get the art side down either, it really makes you question whether you’re going to be a good doctor. I shouldn’t be doing terrible at *everything.*

**Social Life** – I’ve never been Mr. Popularity, but neither am I a pariah. I usually get along with most people and err on the side of a small group of close friends. Now things feel different. While I don’t actively dislike anyone in my class, I certainly don’t feel close to many. When we go out, I’m still a little bit nervous about having enough to say to people. I’m not comfortable just jumping into a circle of conversation. It’s like reverting back to highschool where you aren’t sure where you fit in and feel self-conscious about all your actions. 

I know this became super long and I don’t really expect anyone to read it. These are just some things that seem to be getting the best of me lately.

&gt;The patient is not a very good historian.  When we first met him, we looked at his abdomen. We saw multiple scars, hernias, and an ileal loop, and we asked him what operations he had had.  He responded he had never been operated on.

Then later:

&gt;Importantly, we have been able to ascertain that in the distant past, at a time when he lived in a faraway city, the name of which he does not remember, an episode occurred involving money, women, and alcohol, ending up in a knife wound to the abdomen and a large exploratory laparotomy.

What do people think about the following two potential posting rules?

* Posts about medical news should be from a medical journal or at the very least a reliable news source that uses citations, with unreferenced articles and media sources with poor accuracy records (such as Psychology Today, the Daily Mail, and so on) being subject to removal.

* No memes. If you have something personal you'd like to share, share it in a more intelligent fashion and we'd love to hear it.

I think this would be excellent, in that it would first and foremost encourage people to post actually valuable information, rather than the lowest common denominator journalism that we often get instead of actual research. Second, it would empower us (the mods) to remove some of the garbage that comes in rather than let it sit around and set a de facto lower standard of posting, which encourages more of the same.

This wouldn't apply to blog posts about personal experiences or the sort of humor that we've had (such as the [homeopathy emergency room](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/pir6n/bbc_skit_about_homeopathy_replacing_medicine/) or [brain surgeon](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/pjz6w/in_keeping_with_the_last_that_mitchell_and_webb/) submissions): I think those are in keeping with what /r/medicine is. I would like to see the reliability and accuracy of submissions go up, however, and avoid poorly written posts about what could be good information if someone had bothered to find the actual medical data (such as with the recent [hepatitis C](http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/psmql/university_of_alberta_researcher_discovers/) article, which could have been a great submission if from a better source, as the Medical XPress article didn't represent the data accurately).

Just got back from the hospital, and I had quite a interesting case today. I thought I could share this with all of you, ladies and gentleman.

It's a very interesting case because of it's rich semiology. It is a not so unusual disease under quite unusual circunstances. It may not chalenge more experienced doctors so much, but I'm sure students will have a hard time figuring the diagnosis out because of the vastness of information.

I know I was impressed. This case is not in my usual scope.

I won't give our conduct or the diagnosis until before I go to sleep, in 6~8h. Have a good puzzle solving time! Here are my notes:

--------------------

55 year old man, caucasian, married for twenty years, retired due to his condition.

Reason for the consult: ""I've been having some joint pain for a while""

Recent history: Presents with severe joint pain in several joint, but specialy at his fingers, made worst by moving the limbs/fingers and lifting weight. There is also swelling of every joint affected, that never gets better. all symptons are worst at night, and he often wakes up in pain, because the weight of his sheets are hurting him.

Has been using oral diclofenac for pain relief, with mild succes, against medical advice.

Diagnostic hypothesis: gout.

Past history:

Patient had a total of 9 kidney stones. None of them would show on the x-ray, only on the US. He removed 3, the first couple when he was 16 (not a mistake) and a Staghorn. The stones he has now are all minor, compared to the old ones. He denies back pain, but says one of his kidneys no longer works.

He's been hypertense for as long as he can remember, but says it was diagnosed after the first couple stones were removed (SIC). Is currently on irregular use of captopril and anlodipine.

Likewise, he has anemia for as long as he can remember. (SIC)

Has had ostheosporosis for 30 years, right after his marriage, that has worsend to the point it's hard to walk.

The chronic kidney failure has been diagnosed about 20 years ago, after the removal of the staghorn calculus. He brings an US that shows a very diminshed right kidney. The left kidney shows no significant alterations. None of his 6 stones are seen in the x-ray.

Also had a ischemic stroke 5 years ago, that left him with some dificulty to speak and move his left arm.

Ever since the stroke he has been experiencing arrithmias and chest pain. He claims his last physician told him his hearth was enlarged (SIC), but he brings no exams to confirm that.

Denies diabetes (one is out!).

Family history: nothing relevant that he can remember. His father died of a stroke (SIC).

Social history: Evangelical. Denies smoking and drinking, ever. Denies recreational drugs, ever. Denies sexual promiscuity.
Presents no relevant risk factors for any disease that might matter to this case.
Claims he eats little and healthy.

On physical examination:

General state:
Male, 176cm, 79kg, 69 cm on abdomen.
Lucid, oriented, talks with dificulty, Glasgow 15/15.
No cyanosis or jaundice. Edema on lower limbs.
Pale mucous membranes 3/4+.

Vitals:
BP: 190x140
pulse: 89 bpm
Temp: 37,0 celsius on axilla
Breathings: 22 bpm

Movement:
Got in the room marching with short steps.
Dificulty moving his left arm in any direction.
Had trouble sitting dow and standing.

Cardiovascular:
Regular Cardiac Rythim, 2 Sounds, NormoPhonetic Hearth Sounds, no murmurs. Metalic click on mithral focus. Ictus devieted to the Left.

Pulmonary:
Present Pulmonary Sounds, Expansive, Normotimpanic lungs.

Urinary:
Nothing to report. Giordano sign was not tested.

Complementary examinations (only the altered results):

Slightly elevated neutrophiles.
Slightly elevated plaquets.
Slightly decreased albulmin.

Uric acid extremely elevated.

Every part of his lipidic profile was slightly elevated.

Creatinin 1,7 (high), urea 48 (normal), creatinin filtering rate 23 (very low).

He also bought exams to support each claim he made about his past conditions, so that we could confirm what he had in the past.

-----------------------------

We started treatment for his new found gout, but where wondering how could someone have so many symptons and diseases at once.

A guy at our team noticed there was a couple exams we should still make. Biochemic and imaging. We did then, and found an underlying cause for all this.

I will come back later to give you people the name of the exams and the name of the disease! I could also add a smalll discusion about how my friend figured out this diagnosis, if you guys want it. Smell ya later, r/medicine! Fell free to speculate on the comments!

**EDIT: Time has come...**

Let's think about it backwards, in a very, VERY, simplified way.

He had acid uric kidney stones since he was 16. Those destroyed his kidneys, as time went by. After he got Chronic Kidney Failure, he became severely hypertense. His vitamin D production was also affected, because Vit. D is activated in the kidneys. So his bones started decaying. They decayed so much he had trouble walking. He also had anemia, most of the time. This probably got worse with the kidney dying, and must have had a role in his stroke and hearth failure. Now his acid uric levels are scaling even more - you can tell because the crystals are no longer being deposited in his kidneys, but are going thru his blood and forming in his joints. To make things worse, he started taking an NSAID that is terrible for the kidneys and is a powerful antiuricosuric.

So, most of his problems are a consequence of the kidney failure, and the kidney failure was developed because of kidney stones... But his bone decay was very imoressive for a 55 year old male, so I had an idea: calcium was leaving his bones, too.

Turns out no one ever tested his blood for parathormone. It's standard in kidney failure, because it can produce secondary hiperparathyroidsm. I asked for the exam. He had high parathormone, but never had high calcium levels. I was satisfied. A friend of mine, an endocrinologist, was not.

He told me that my diagnose still had a flaw: his phosphate levels were low. At secondary HPT, they are usually high. We asked for an neck CT and biopsy of the gland... He had primary HPT!

**Our patient, 55 years old, had symptons for Primary Hyperparathyroidism since he was 16. His first signs were kidney failure and kidney stones - the most obvious ones, but nobody ever thought of it. If he had surgery to remove his parathyroids 40 years ago, he would be mostly healthy today!**

I saw two guys who stated either primary or secondary HPT. Congratulations for both! You couldn't really define which one it was without the info I gave now.

So never forget, my collegues, the importance of our roles on the lifes of patients. And have a good night!",,False,,t5_2qhff,True,,,True,t3_kkxrc,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/kkxrc/doctors_and_studants_from_rmedicine_i_have_a_case/,

Step 1 &lt;210, almost all P's in third year with great written comments, got a Pass from my home institution in EM that is based almost entirely on evaluations.  With a comment that stated I had knowledge gaps.  

I have to admit, I am pretty bummed.  I left the rotation feeling like I had done better than pass-quality work, and that I had come across in my interactions with my evaluators as appropriately knowledgeable, but the people evaluating me disagreed and it's just a serious blow to my confidence. I used to be able to rationalize my sea of P's with the knowledge that in other clerkships, test scores make the grade, and I know I don't take tests particularly well.  What kills me is that this rotation's grade is based almost entirely on evaluations, which have historically been a strong point for me, and I still only passed.   I'm concerned about being found deficient by people in the specialty I've chosen.  At this point, it's not even about whether or not I'll match.  My worry is that I won't ever be as good as I need to be to care for patients well and to feel good about my work.

Has anyone else who underperformed in medical school felt this way?  My confidence is shot to shreds, and I feel so inadequate relative to my peers.  Will that ever resolve?  Should I even put myself through  the trials of match when the 40-50 rejections come through the mail?  Or should I cancel Step 2 and my away and try another field where I'll be less deficient.

During the past year, my gap year between undergrad and med school, I decided to work as an ophthalmic technician with a group of ophthalmologists in NYC.  Out of the five doctors in the practice, two of them were rude, but one was the most unpleasant person I have ever come across.  The things that I came across were very unprofessional and I wanted to know how I should deal with those types of people in my future career in medicine.

The head of the practice, I will call him Dr. R, would scream at his staff (technicians, fellows, research physicians, and front desk) all day, and to make matters worse, it would mostly be in front of patients.  Examples of things he would say would be, ""Are you learning disabled?!?"" to the technicians, he told me multiple times in front of patients ""You don't have the common sense to make it in medical school,""  he told the international fellow from Iraq, ""this isn't the streets of Baghdad and you should be more hygienic,"" (when a technician forgot to clean the slit lamp), and also told the international fellow ""You would be better off strapping a bomb to yourself and blowing yourself up"" in front of the patients.  We have several members of the staff that are not native speakers of English, and he often mocks their English in front of them when they make small errors.

This is just the tip of the iceberg, and I wish I had written down more of what he said during the time I was working there.

I'm a young MD nearing the end of my residency and have started actively planning on more or less selling my possessions and getting the heck out of Dodge. Specifically, I'm planning on traveling as much as possible, with as little as possible. Unfortunately, I still carry a significant loan burden from med school. What's the best way to manage this? I'm currently on the IBR plan, which will drop my payments to zero when my income more or less goes away. Of course, the interest will continue to pile up, but then it should be forgiven in 20 years under the recent loan reform, correct? I realize that I am signing myself up for living in poverty for at least two decades. Mostly I'm concerned about making sure that nothing can fall on my family. Please let me know if you have any suggestions.

EDIT: Many people have been asking why I made this decision. As I've said below, there was no ""defining moment""; rather, this is a culmination of events. My complaints are no different from those that you hear from colleagues in daily practice, many of which you may harbor yourself. Long hours, high stress, defensive practice, insurance company nightmares, and on and on. What made the difference for me is that I realized I have no justification for pressing on. Others have children or an expensive lifestyle to support. I'm unattached and healthy with very little attaching me to others apart from family ties. My lifestyle is simple and I abhor extravagance.

I just wanted to give everyone a view into how much a typical medical student debt would be these days (I think I read somewhere the average is $155k). I graduated in 2010 from a state medical school (read: in-state tuition), I only used public stafford loans (sub and unsub) to finance my education. During residency I used my 6 months deferment, paid IBR for 1.5 years. In my last year residency, I decided to go into forebearance due to some unforeseen expenses. I am now almost out of residency, and have a job lined up. I should be able to pay this off without to much heartache, but really I hate being in this much debt. I graduated college without any debt whatsoever. This is solely educational debt that I incurred throughout residency and medical school. I have no other consumer debt (I do have a mortgage though). For the most part, I think I've been fairly financially responsible, though I do see some things I could have improved upon (like pay more towards my debt during residency).

I guess my point is this: be sure this is what you want to do, especially if you have to finance your education. Otherwise you are going to be in a world of hurt in the future.

Over the last two years, and from my SO being a nurse, I have developed a less than flattering opinion of the general public and their view of the medical system.  What I want to know is if my opinion is jaded and flawed or if it is common among physicians? 
You've all probably seen it, on reddit and in person, a medical/health care related topic comes up and inevitably the conversation digresses and suddenly everyone and their dog has a story about how the health care system screwed them or a close/distant relative at some point.  The conversation quickly becomes about the myriad shortcomings (read: complete fucking incompetence) of physicians, nurses, and the health care system.  
What I have come to understand through my education is a very important point that seems to be lost on the general public - medicine is NOT a perfect science.  It would appear that the majority of people have a completely skewed and romanticized vision of the health care system where they see it as a body that exists to cater to their every whim and diagnose, cure and rehabilitate them with 100% success, no mistakes made and no questions asked.  When in reality there should be a mutual understanding that when a person access medical care it is not unreasonable to assume that everything possible will be done to dx and tx a person, as long as they understand that medicine and physicians have their limits and that's just the nature of medicine. Further, it seems that public opinion seems to have shifted in a way that physicians are viewed as servants and that positive medical outcomes are a patient's god given right.  When in reality, we are purveyors of expert advice and that we do not operate in a field of 100% success.  

Edit 1:  I should specify that when I say 'servant' I mean that sometimes the expectation is that a patient will know their condition and what they need for it, and that a physician is there to provide only what the patient is requesting.

Edit 2:  The issue that I have brought up is something that I experience outside of the hospital/clinic setting.  I have had nothing but positive experiences with patients on my clinical rounds.  They are typically very receptive, willing to listen, and grateful.  This is not an issue of being appreciated or praised by patients, as I have had great patient/dr. relationships with the majority of my patients.  This is an issue of the negativity that I have experience outside the clinical setting.

Does anyone else believe that the discrepancy between patient's expectations and reality has created a very negative public opinion of physicians and health care?  Has anyone thought like this in the past but had their opinion changed by something?  Do more experienced physicians see this issue differently? How do you deal with this issue on a personal and professional level?  Thanks meddit!

I hated memorizing facts and such but did it to build the base of knowledge to work around. If I could understand something I could 9 out 10x remember it.

What I enjoyed the most during the transition from MS2 to MS3 was being able to come up with a diagnosis/differential. But now 95% of the time that's not super challenging anymore. And oftentimes they just order labs/path that reveal what it is. Then people go into uptodate and look up how to manage/treat it if they'r unfamiliar with the diagnosis or if they want ""new"" ideas. It just feels like a robot can do it. Then on the surgical/procedural side, it seems like 75% of people's days are spent doing the same exact thing over and over. And a lot of it getting replaced by midlevel providers that just do the same thing over and over. I guess my main dissatisfaction is I just dont feel like im solving a puzzle or using my brain and energy meaningfully anymore. It seems like everyone just loves facts/memorizing random tidbits instead of doing any real analysis. They just seem to love regurgitating relative risks and probabilities.

Now what?",disgruntledgraduate,52,7,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/mv294/spent_20_years_in_school_150000_finally_graduated/,"I got into medicine because I wanted a career where I could feel like I was helping people while using science.

I decided this in high school, then I did biology as an undergrad, then went straight to med school. I did pretty well in the ""preclinical"" years (lots of ""honors"" grades, 250s on step 1, etc) but during the clinical years, I struggled a bit. Turns out, my ability to understand intricate things isn't quite as important as having an ability to decipher what patients are saying, figure out their (usually mundane) problem, and then decide on a course of action.

Being truly shy, and also very introverted don't help either, when making hospital rounds, seeing patients in clinic, and talking with nurses, therapists and consultants is basically my whole job.

Anyway, I'd always thought that I wanted to be a surgeon, but gave that up in my 4th year because of the hours, the additional stress, and to be honest, some degree of not enough self-confidence. I ended up getting into a family medicine residency, which I started last July.

I guess it's OK. I do really believe that primary care is a valuable thing, I mean, I believe in the specialty. I CAN perform my duties. I'm convinced that my problem has a lot less to do with my specialty in medicine than being involved in medicine as a whole.

But now that I'm actually ""doing"" some real medicine, I hate it. I don't like being in the hospital, I especially don't like being ""on call"" just waiting around to have to go admit another alcoholic in DKA, and I don't like clinic (too quick, too much paperwork, too many drug seekers).

I keep telling myself that, once I just get used to it, get through the first few months, get past intern year, that it will be better, and I'll start liking my job, getting better at it, and I'll love medicine.

But I'm not so sure. I have a hard time thinking that I'll instantly change my personality to be compatible with doing medicine well. Its hard to believe that the nature of the work changes substantially after intern year. I worry that I've wasted so much time and energy and years of my life learning something, only to realize that I despise it, and given the chance would run far, far away from.

I don't know what to do. Part of me knows that I can stick it out, get used to this, just put my head down and do it for the next 30 years. There's another part of me that tells me I need to listen to my gut and find a different career. Obviously I'm torn. Like a lot of people, I want a career that matches up with my interests, and let's me feel like I'm doing something important for the world. I've thought a lot about the possibility of getting into more of a bench research type of career (though more schooling would probably be needed for that).

This will sound petty, but I find it discouraging when a nursing specialty (CRNAs) can do the bread and butter of my specialty. 

Yes, I get told repeatedly that the CRNAs don't know much about pharmacokinetics/dynamics and cardiopulmonary physiology and that's why we're so much better than them. I know the MD has plenty of other roles outside of the OR such as putting together the treatment plan, preop eval, etc. This still doesn't change the fact that every anesthesiologist has told me that I will be forced to specialize since the market will be overrun by CRNAs by the time I finish residency. 

I'm only speculating, but based off the current legislative trends it seems that more and more states will be allowing CRNAs to practice independently.

Going through all these posts, many many people seem bitter and angry (with the time spent in school and effort). It's just making me really question if I want to enter this(these) professions.

So what am I asking, is was the work worth it? The countless hours studying for the MCAT, for Step One, etc. The sleepless nights, the stress, the pain, was it worth it for where you are now? (Or where you're heading).

This watch would be a digital watch with many of the standard features like alarm clocks and timers.  However, this watch would also include an LED flashlight for quick neuro checks, measurements on the wristband for fast wound length estimation, a metronome for CPR compression rhythm, and a counter to track heart rate and respirations-per-minute. The default display would be in 24 hour format with easily readable date.

4. Round on post-op patients till around 7:45 am aka following one of the residents as she asks the post-delivery patients how they are feeling, if they have any complaints, and to follow-up on recent labs, and future management plans, etc.
5. Report to gynecology office down the street at 8 am, saw 4 patients coming in for various issues: normal check-up, STD testing, vaginal discharge, and vaginal bleeding; I got histories on them all, reported it to my residents, and then helped with the pelvic exams/speculum exams/pap smears with my residents; wrote SOAP notes for each patient, then the resident and I presented the patient's findings to the attending, who agreed on our management and then finally met the patient himself
6.  Got lunch at hospital cafeteria  1 pm-1:30 pm with fellow med students
7. Reported to L&amp;D floor at 1:40 pm: faxed some stuff, got the history of a patient at 23 weeks here for pelvic pain, called the lab to ask when our results would come, got coffee for a resident, cleaned the ultrasound machines, helped find proper-sized gloves for a resident, got forms from a different room for a resident, observed as a resident talked to a patient about the possibility of C-section, talked with the attending who showed up for a moment about my thoughts on the rotation, helped a nurse move the phlebotomy tray, waited around for a while as nothing was going on, studied on my ipad mini
8. Left at 6:30 pm, went home, ate dinner, attempted to study but very tired

Or how many patients stop taking their augmentin once they start to feel better, regardless of how many days of therapy they have left.

I believe that an important root cause of this noncompliance is low health literacy; that is, patients' expectation of the role of medications in their therapy does not match what the role of their medications actually is (They expect lisinopril to permanently fix their hypertension, not just control it). This causes confusion when the instructions tell the patients to do something that, in their mind, makes no sense (Why would I refill my lisinopril if I'm already cured?). Some patients follow the instructions, others trust their intuition.

I have 3 questions for you medical professionals:

* Do you think that poor patient understanding is an important root cause of patient noncompliance?
* How do you, personally, address that root cause, be it poor understanding or otherwise?
* Ideally, what do you think would best improve patient compliance and outcomes?

I'm at the end of med school and i'm currently in my emergency room rotation. Its all going really well and i like my choice of medicine as a study a lot. I plan to apply for a orthopaedic surgery residency after my PhD research in bone tumors is complete. However i noticed one weird and for me a bit scary thing.

Sometimes when i stitch up a patient my hands shake badly, i can still perform the procedure (closing after surgery/stitching wounds etc) but especially rotating the needle in the clamp is sometimes hard. I do get compliments for how the result looks, but it takes longer. Im not that trained in stitching yet, done it 25-35 times or so, so maybe it will improve with experience.

Cutting (with a blade), playing guitar, writing etc is not a problem, so i dont think i have an essential tremor/intention tremor. Its worse when lots of people are watching, so it may be anxiety. How did you deal with it, if you had this?

What can i do to reduce the tremors?

I just wanted to get this off my chest.
 
Many DO students (myself included) feel the AOA (American Osteopathic Association) is more of a detriment than anything else. Their extreme obstiancy in terms of making positive changes for the field is really keeping progress in arrested development. Our education is over 90% Allopathic and only 10% Osteopathic yet they want to highlight this difference with lightsabers and continue to delude themselves that they are very different from their MD counterparts.  I don’t mind  the  difference  in approach  however,  to me it’s just a different view through the same physician looking glass. MD or DO most medical schools advocate primary care as their mission so I find it quite annoying when they say it is a DO exclusive (Ironically enough many of the senior positioned DOs are specialists.) The same goes for “looking at the patient as a whole” mantra. I find that this very important for any physician to use in their practice.

 What the ACGME did last year was a wakeup call for the AOA when they decided to bar AOA residents from ACGME fellowships.  I felt it was only fair since the AOA fellowships do not allow ACGME residents into their programs. Bringing  the AOA under the ACGME umbrella is the first good step in making the medical field more cohesive for physicians. I do feel many AOA residency/fellowship programs are lacking in standards and I am glad the ACGME will be monitoring them. I also find it quite sad that many DOs are barred from positions at DO schools because they underwent ACGME residencies and fellowships. 
Overall I feel the AOA is going a different direction than the rising tide of DO graduates and younger physicians. If they keep focusing at the past (AT Still) we will overlook the present and damage our future.  MDs and DOs need to unite and I feel many times it’s the DO’s in charge who are grandstanding and refuse any progress.

I recently worked with a 4th year medical student who is applying to my field. She's not a total idiot, I'm familiar with her board scores and they are decent. The problem is a lack of common sense and general cluelessness about how to get things done. I wouldn't want her to be my co-resident, and she would require lots of training and teaching by attendings to function as an anesthesiology resident because once you're thrown into the OR you have to be able to multi-task like crazy. You know how you look at some people and think ""I wouldn't want them to be my doctor?"" That's her.


Here's my dilemma: my program will rank medical students here highly and if you want to stay here, it usually works out. However, residents who are concerned about a student are able to speak up and that student will not be ranked. There are already some residents in the class below me who are clueless and incompetent and I can see the problems that arise there, they make you nervous and get taken out of difficult cases because you're not sure if you can trust them. On the other hand, she's not a BAD person, just kind of useless. And her being a resident here will have absolutely no effect on me, just on the attendings and her classmates.

I am currently a fourth year medical student who should be getting my application ready to apply for residencies. Instead, I find myself languishing the days away in bed or in front of my computer. Throughout all of medical school, I have been struggling with major depression on top of a sleep disorder, and that has been difficult enough. But there are also weeks at a time, that occur every so often, when symptoms are more pronounced, and it becomes arduous and exhausting to even arrive on time at my clinical sites.

Currently, I am on my anesthesia rotation. This is an important rotation for me, because anesthesia is what I hope to do.  However, due to these problems, I’ve missed quite a number of days. I was hoping to use this as an opportunity to get some letters of recommendation, but I’ve squandered it. 

So not only do I feel like I have screwed myself over even as far as applications go, but I have also become really worried about the prospect of intern year. I know that it will be very demanding, and it will be impossible for me to fulfill those responsibilities it at this rate.

I’ve talked with student affairs in the past; they seem mostly interested in confirming that I am not suicidal (I’m not) and then refer me to a psychiatrist. I’ve been seeing a psychiatrist for 2 years now, and various medications have not really brought about much change in any of my symptoms yet. So I am not sure where else to turn. The idea of taking time off has been suggested, but since I need to be using this time to apply for residencies, this may be the worst possible time to take a leave of absence. Additionally, I’m not sure what taking time off would accomplish.

I guess my questions are: Is it impossible for me to be or even become a doctor? Have I kissed my chances at having an acceptable application goodbye? Has anyone else dealt with major depression or sleep disorders through medical school? How did they challenge you, and what helped you?

EDIT: I want to thank everyone for their advice and concern, and I want to apologize for not responding sooner. I was able to talk with student affairs and the anesthesia clerkship director; I have moved some rotations around in my schedule to allow for some time off without having to take an actual medical leave (but the option is there should I need it). Additionally, I was offered some make-up dates for anesthesia, and the clerkship director is keeping these issues between us. I have to say, everything has worked out better than I thought it would. I was surprised at the understanding that everyone showed. Still, I have to focus on getting better--I've agreed to meet with a therapist on a regular basis (something I'd not been doing before) and I have a new appointment with a psychiatrist to adjust my meds.

Our overall goal is for Clear, Comfortable vision.  Let me give you a breakdown of the exam from the visual perspective only, no pathology in this post.

-THIS IS NOT EXHAUSTIVE, BUT MEANT TO BE AN GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE PROCESS OF THE REFRACTIVE PORTION OF AN EYE EXAM.

-We check your visual acuity. ""Read the letters on the wall"" Gives us a base level.

-We then OBJECTIVELY check your RX (retinoscopy or autorefractor) and if it jives with your acuity, then we proceed. We expect about 1 line of letters lost for every 0.25 - 0.50 diopters of ametropia.  If not, then we start suspecting pathology, old or new, or amblyopia.  The objective measurement gives us only a baseline.  Autorefractors can only provide decent data; the best in evaluating the axis of astigmatism.

-Then we ask you which is better, 1 or 2 - changing only 1 factor at a time. We use a physchophysical approach to the questions, using bracketing and stair-stepping to find the correct answer.  This is a lot like engineering (previous work experience) problem solving / trouble shooting come into play. We expect truthful answers, even 'I don't know' tells us something.

-First we change the sphere, then the axis of cylinder (lenses / eyes can have two focal points for incoming light due to shape), then power of cylinder, then backtrack - axis of cylinder, then back to sphere so that we didn't ""OVER-MINUS"" you. See below for further explanation of this one. Finally we balance the stimulus to accommodation between the two eyes; even work loads for the ciliary muscles.

-Next we objectively / subjectively evaluate the vergence posture (alignment of the eyes) for tropias and phorias. Where the eyes position themselves in relation to each other. If someone has 'the googly eye', where it's noticeably out of alignment, then they are strabismic and have a degree of tropia. Some people have a smaller version of this, but their muscles are strong enough to counteract the issue: phoria. You'll see it manifest when they are tired or have been drinking. We see it when we cover one eye and then the other.  They'll complain of seeing double. Sometimes phorias can turn to tropias as you age.  Just like all other muscles, they get weaker.

-The eyes have a triad: accommodation, convergence, and miosis. Basically, when you focus on something up close (accommodation), your eyes come toward your nose (convergence) and your pupil constricts (miosis). All this happens at the same time automatically. 

-When you stimulate accommodation by over-minusing/under-plussing, you stimulate convergence.

-Over-minusing / Under-plussing is when the lens causes a stimulation of accommodation when looking in the distance. Not harmful, but causes the ciliary muscle to remain flexed at all times. You can see clearly (provided you're under 42-ish), but will fatigue and get headaches among other things. It can also cause a person to overwhelm their compensatory eye muscle power leading to a tropia.

-Most people have enough muscle power to account for small misalignments of their eyes. Some people are on the borderline (either at distance or at near). When you over-minus / over-plus a person that is borderline, you could make them decompensate - go from a manageable phoria to a tropia (they'll see double), or go from a comfortable phoria to an uncomfortable phoria. The degree by which a change in dioptric lens power changes the vergence (eye alignment) is the AC/A ratio: for every diopter change in power, there is a prism diopter change in vergence.

-There is no perfect answer, mostly compromises between clarity and comfort. That part takes experience. It costs a lot of money to remake someone's glasses that are dissatisfied.  That is why there is an art and a science to prescribing.  You could make a computer program to get the perfect refraction, but that could lead to unhappy patients.  You have to take into account the human element, based on history, needs, and goals.  Some people need precision; for some that'd be sensory overload.

-Some of our more 'experienced' patients require help for seeing up close. This takes an extra level of expertise. Basically, all it takes is being good at asking questions and finding out where they have the greatest need, taking into account age, and Rx.

-We also evaluate the health of the eye (as a primary eye healthcare provider). If your Rx was -0.50D in both eyes, but one eye only saw 20/100 (or 6/30 for our metric users), then there is another cause for the loss. We look at the front (cornea and tear film), the middle (lens and vitreous), and the back (retina, nerve, and choroid) for reasons for the loss. Pupil constrictions and eye movements help identify neurological causes for vision loss and diplopia.

-The eye is a very complicated part of your body, but vision is much more so because the eye is nothing but an extension of the brain. If you mess with parts of the brain (occipital lobe, Lateral Geniculate Nucleus, Optic Tract, Optic Chiasm, swollen pituitary gland, high CSF pressure, etc. etc.), then things go south pretty quickly.

-Lastly, children while still developing need good vision from early on to help with appropriate vision development. They continue to develop until they're around 8 or 10.  If they don't have proper vision or alignment, then the brain can actively stunt nerve growth by shutting down signals to a particular eye (or both). This is called amblyopia and is usually easily prevented with early exams. Adults are one thing, but children are another. In the US, we give free exams to ALL young children through the InfantSee program.  Most doctors recommend a first eye exam around 2-3 years old, no later than 4.

-Lastly, before you say glasses are a rip off because you can get the same thing cheaper, it's not.  It's like comparing a Mercedes to a Kia and saying they're the same.  You're right and you're wrong.  It depends on your needs and wants.  Extras cost extra.  Besides, those $9 frames aren't typically made by adult American / Japanese / European workers in factories with good labor laws...  Typical markup is 100%, the same or worse than many other retail products.

Tuition and fees vary a lot, but in Texas it's about $18,000 per year, so using that as a baseline, paying a stipend of $18,000 per year to each student would only cost $4.9 billion per year. Of course, most of the time people are given allowances for room and board too, which in Texas adds another $22,000, so the total is $40,000 per year. A stipend covering that cost would still only cost about $11 billion per year.

Assuming we were not strapped for cash at the moment, $11 billion is next to nothing compared to the entire US federal budget. We spend $18 billion per year on NASA. We're talking about cutting the defense budget by $55 billion a year for the next ten years, so $11 billion per year is easily doable.

The drug development funding model is broken and it’s costing lives. A simple legislative amendment can solve this issue.  ,MedicalPrize,40,7,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/133ugy/potentially_safe_and_effective_but_unpatentable/,"Did you know that the pharmaceutical industry regularly screens out potentially safe and effective drugs at development stage due to unpatentability? This happens every day behind closed doors and is never publicized. This may sound like a conspiracy theory, but [as this recent paper from a Harvard law professor explains](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1127742), it is not. 

Have any researchers experienced funding issues for a potentially safe and effective medical treatment which is 'unpatentable', 'unprofitable' or 'unmarketable'?

I realised the fundamental problem is not a lack of research, but that the funding model is broken. There are political solutions which can give researchers a chance to get funding to develop cures. I believe in directly raising money for clinical trials by donations/grants, but without a change in the system, a drug will never get the (approximately US$1 billion) funding it needs to get regulatory approval.

A simple solution is to change the law so that major regulatory agencies (e.g. FDA/EMA) can grant 12 years market exclusivity for new drugs (they currently grant only 5 years, which is insufficient). This exclusivity will allow researchers to raise the funding to conduct clinical trials, irrespective of patentability. We should also establish a new medical funding model of using prizes to be paid for successful outcomes in clinical trials, which can be used to incentivise development of 'unprofitable' medical treatments for third world diseases.

We need to fix the broken system, and properly incentivise development of safe and effective treatments by doctors and researchers.  

Hopefully we can get some industry insiders to start talking about this issue, which is costing lives every day. If this gets enough interest, I will establish a charitable organisation to raise public awareness and lobby for change. Would you support this organisation through a crowdfunding campaign? The goal is to reduce reliance on patents for drug development. Big Pharma's only concern is to prevent generic competition, and there are existing market exclusivity mechanisms already in place. All that is required is raising awareness and get political will to support this simple legislative amendment. 

I don't have a lot of faith in Reddit to help publicise or be sympathetic to this issue, but maybe this can get in front of the right people by chance. 

**TL;DR: Unpatentable drugs never get funding for clinical trials. Thousands of drugs are abandoned because of patent issues and the public never finds out. Granting 12 years market exclusivity for new drugs will allow researchers to raise the funding to conduct clinical trials, irrespective of patentability.**

EDIT: Thanks for the upvotes! 

Just to give some more details, there is also a need to allow some kind of exclusivity/priority for the sponsor of the clinical trials, in the absence of patents (because drug companies will be unhappy with relying on trade secret protection for their clinical trial data  - which will be difficult and expensive to enforce). 

A method to accomplish this could be a special clinical trial registration system for otherwise 'public domain' drugs/treatments. The registration of a clinical trial using a treatment protocol (which is published at the same time) would create a ‘priority date’ for that company, whereby the sponsor must start a new clinical trial using the same (or similar) protocol within a certain period of the registration (e.g. 2 years), or they lose that priority date. The drug company which obtains market approval for a drug treatment protocol with the earliest priority date will get the 12 years market exclusivity for that treatment protocol (so it will not be possible for a second company to 'free-ride' on previous clinical trials conducted by the innovator company - unless the innovator delays in conducting new trials). It may be possible to provide that the results of the trial using that protocol must also be published in a peer reviewed journal and also, the sponsor of the original clinical trial has a time limit to achieve regulatory approval (e.g. 8 years), otherwise priority is lost. At the same time, the company could file new patents on any 'surprising' innovations discovered during clinical trials. This system would allow a researcher to register their clinical trial and have a chance of getting private funding, even without a patent.

My MS3 on service last month was a solid worker and we got to be pretty good friends, and he's interested in surgery. However when I asked him why (to work on him a bit..I myself am not in a surgical specialty ;) ) his reason floored me.  Apparently the main reason he wants to be a surgeon is because his entire life he was told that he couldn't use his hands for shit and was constantly harrassed/bullied by adults as well as his peers.  We still keep in contact and I try to mentor him when I can, but my concern is how to break the news to him that entering a specialty based solely on anger (which he has a lot of) may not be the greatest idea.  I'm sure that if he worked hard he could become a surgeon but speaking frankly, I think he would be a square peg in a round hole.  Any thoughts on what my role should be?

While I don't prescribe things for family members besides the odd acne cream or emergency inhaler, they often come to me with medical questions.  My advice is generally to talk to their own doctors, except when it comes to my own field.

I could see that my grandma's PCP was overmedicating her with benzos and TCAs (at grandma's request).  I attempted to get her to wean down on the benzos after letting her PCP know, because she's a fall risk and brittle as can be.  Managed to get her to half her dose of benzos before I had to leave town.  She then started to complain of dizziness again (code for ""anxious"" in our somaticizing culture), so my dad bought some weird ergotamine drug from Asia through my aunt.  Of course that made things worse, and she became delirious.  

Got a call from mom asking if it was normal for old people to start seeing things or getting days and nights confused.  They ignored my recommendation to seek medical attention.  My helpful aunt decided to mail some Ambien(!) to help grandma get some sleep.  

I am seriously at wits' end here.  It's one thing to screw around with your own meds, but to experiment on my grandmother is another thing.

When I completed my final year of high school, I had the marks for undergrad medicine (I'm in Australia, education system is different - we go straight from school to university). However, my hometown didn't offer the Premed exam, and I couldn't get to one that did. So I figured, I'll do one year of nursing (offered at my hometown university) and apply for a transfer. I then found I enjoyed my classes, and the work I did on clinicals, so I completed my Bachelor of Nursing/Bachelor of Arts/Science. I've done three years hard work at my state's top hospital, in both Cardiology/Cardiothoracic Surgery and now in Emergency and Trauma. During that time I've completed a couple of units post grad study.

However, the option of Medicine has never left my mind. I don't know whether it's because I want to prove to myself I could do it, or because it really is my dream job. But I'm not fulfilled doing what I'm doing now, and I have no innate desire to continue down the traditional route of nursing career development (postgrad degree, ANUM, NUM etc). The thought of studying Medicine still excites me, and when working with the doctors around me I can't help but think 'I wish I could be there, making those decisions, taking my knowledge that big step further.'

Having researched it, assuming I do well on my premed exam and interviews, I could enter and complete my post graduate medical degree by 30, starting my internship at 31. On one level, I think that's a great age to be doing it. On another, it makes me think; if I'm an intern at 31, at what age am I going to be making decent money (I'd be making what I am now, only 6 years on)? At what age would I be able to take a break, start a family? Is taking this course going to scuttle my chances of having a family, am I going to end up married to my job? On some level I know that this shouldn't be an issue if I was really certain about medicine, that I should just want to do it no matter what. But it does factor into my decision making.

I don't have any female friends who are doctors. I would love to hear from some of you out there who are doing it, facing this issue and finding your way through it.

TL;DR Trying to decide whether to settle on my current career with it's guaranteed family time, or risk it all on my medical dream.",,False,,t5_2qhff,False,,,True,t3_u7923,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/u7923/female_doctors_of_reddit_i_need_career_advice/,

Just wanted to share my thoughts about Psychiatry and my journey towards it...

Anyway, I'm a medical student at present and entering my final year. (in ON, Canada) I did pretty well in my rotations (not boasting, just stating the facts) so am able to choose between various specialties such as Internal Medicine, Psychiatry, Family Medicine. I came into medical school wanting to do Psychiatry because I particularly enjoyed working closely with patients and people, and personally feel that Mental Illness can be far more devastating than other types of illness. During my undergrad years, I got the opportunity to do research and witness clinical psychology. I could see how Mental Illness could tear families up, how patients also have to deal with stigma and how Mental Illnesses can often become the biggest priority. Sure some patients may also have heart disease and diabetes, but the schizophrenia when uncontrolled leads to them not taking their pills and a downward spiral culminating in disaster. Then when I see how most patients with mental illness get ripped on by family members and society in general I feel like helping them all the more (Of course some family members are supportive thankfully) I see mentally ill patients with addictions and schizophrenia on the street as homeless people and I feel sad that sometimes they're seen as bums not as patients without care.

Anyway, in medical school and in society I keep picking up a negative perception towards mental illness. My family members keep trying to persuade me to pick internal medicine and do cardiology or GI given my good reference letters from internal medicine preceptors. They feel that the good pay is worth it and at least I get respect from society.  Even within medicine, other students tell me not to pick Psychiatry as I won't be paid nearly as much as the more lucrative specialties such as Gastroenterology. And I won't have to put up with society's bullshit and demonization. (I keep hearing from random knowitalls how Psychiatry and Psychology is pseudo science)

Yet somehow, I still wanted to do Psychiatry. I wanted to help the vulnerable patients who have mental illnesses and make a difference in their lives. I wanted to care for them and do my part to make their lives meaningful and productive. Yet, repeatedly I get battered by people: Emergency doctors, people in the street, family members....all these people give me negative reactions when I say I wanna be a Psychiatrist. (Its like telling somebody you're gay...there's so much goddamn stigma)

I came really close to not picking Psychiatry. I'm smart, I have lots of options. Why pick a specialty where society doesn't give a shit? Why pick a specialty where I don't get paid as much as the big buck specialties? Why pick a specialty where people like Tom Cruise and his scientology cronies try to make me look like an evil person? 

Anyhow, I turned to the internet to try and find if anybody even appreciated Psychiatry, and I stumbled upon hundreds and hundreds of hate sites. Some christian zealots, scientologists, disgruntled patients, random armchair scientists (e.g. Joe Blow who took a psychology course and now is an expert on the latest scientific research. Josh Fuckwit who has a friend for whom drug treatment didn't apparently work so he knows for sure shrinks are quacks)....and so on. And I got more and more angry with them all as a whole. I was ready to write off Psychiatry as a career. 

But then again every now and then, I meet people who remind me that Psychiatry is a meaningful career.  And they remind me why I want to be a shrink. Because its a meaningful career. And the drugs work!!!! We don't necessarily know why, but we do know they work! And as anybody in medical school knows, not all medical treatment results in instant effective cures. Even if we stent patients or replace valves, patients still die in around 6-10 years from cardiac pathology. We aren't God (yet). There is no effective ""cure"" for CHF or Diabetes. We can do a Whipples procedure but patients will still most prolly die if they have Pancreatic cancer. Similarly in Psychiatry, we can help with symptom management and ease lives, but we may not be able to effectively wipe out the disease. But we can drastically improve lives.

Anyway, I'm going to do Psychiatry. I know I'm smart and I hope I can bring changes to my patients lives. I know the job is meaningful. I'm going to try to do my bests to counter the antipsychiatry efforts.  (I'm really mad at them for confusing people about Psychiatry. Anybody who thinks they have depression who types up psychiatry usually finds some junk articles which purport psychiatry to be some kind of organized scam. I wonder how many suicides are a direct result of misinformation and patients being confused about seeking help) The internet is honestly a terrible place to find information about medical treatment, particularly with Psychiatry. You have idiots spending hours putting up antipsychiatry webpages that always end up popping up on Google and resulting in misinformation. 

Anyway, I'm ranting. I'm gonna be a Psychiatrist. I'm gonna do my best to help patients with mental illnesses. Antipsychiatrists can hate. But the career is meaningful. I am picking this career because as a doctor, I can help people with mental illness. I don't know what antipsychiatrists offer patients other than hate and despair. I shall offer them help to the best of todays scientific knowledge.  

And another thing: All these behavioural psychologists and psychodynamic theorists who demonize drug treatment may have a vested interest in promoting psychotherapy over drug therapy. They can't prescribe... just consider that folks before citing psychology research studies that say that drugs don't work. There's a place for drug treatment and there's a place for psychotherapy. Usually there's a place for both. When a patient shows up floridly psychotic in the emergency department, you can't talk to them. You have to medicate and once the patient is stabilized you can start working on psychotherapy. 

Anyway, I hope for a better future for mental illness. One where antipsychiatry fucktards (who most probably don't believe in evolution either...) don't confuse and demonize mentally illness patients and those who dedicate their lives to studying them. Regardless, I shall fight the good fight. They can call me evil all they want, but I will do my bit to help mentally ill patients. And I'm not doing it for the money. I could have just done gastroenterology or something and made far more money. 

Anyway, I hope all you other medical professionals....cardiologists, gastroenterologists, family doctors, surgeons, nurses, paramedics.... take the time and trouble to destigmatize mental illness when you have the chance. If you hear some fucktard on the street put down the study and treatment of mental illness, call them out for acting like a dumb ass. Ask the antipsychiatrists what they offer patients who feel suicidal. Education is key to combating mental illness. 

Anyway, I'm just tired about all the antipsychiatry bullshit I keep hearing. I'm jaded without even entering the Psychiatry profession. I just wanted to hear from all the other medical professionals. Hopefully supportive comments and that others believe that mental illness should be studied and treated. And that Psychiatry isn't as people say bullshit. I also hope that nonmedical people stumble upon this post and hear what the medical community has to say about Psychiatry. Not what some scientologist or some ""alternative medicine"" expert has to say. ",,False,,t5_2qhff,True,,,True,t3_l6dww,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/l6dww/fuck_you_antipsychiatry/,

I bitch about little things with my friends at work all the time, and normally I would've just told the guy to get the fuck out of the room and ripped him a new asshole, but he did this in front of a student who was sent in to observe how to do postmortem prep in the ED, so I couldn't exactly make a scene and in turn a worse impression on the student nurse.

So, I took the student aside, explained exactly what was wrong about that, what should've happened, and that I didn't say anything in there because I didn't want to make a bad situation worse (though I doubt anyone would've seen that and went ""Seems completely acceptable to cork off a dead patient's orifices."")

My question is: how much medicine would a doctor carry with him? I'm mostly thinking antibiotics here. Would a doctor's kit have the antibiotics required to cure them of the infection? If so, would he have enough to cure numerous people or only a few? I can read up on symptoms and treatment, but I have no idea what a doctor might carry with him on a mission like this.

**Edit 2: You are all very intelligent and helpful - actually so intelligent and helpful that you're tearing apart my story. It's OK, though, I'll still write it, even thought it's not medically correct. I'm still open for comments, as this has been very fun and I'm learning loads. Thanks for the help, everyone!**

Edit: After reading your answers I have revised my story slightly according to the answers I got. I'll put my full plan on here if anyone wants more information on what I actually intend to do, so any comments on the probabilty of this are welcomed:

&gt;Background: An exploration team goes out onto an unexplored island to study the biology and wildlife. There are ten people on the team, including a guide and a doctor. They expect to stay for approximately 2-3 weeks, and it is a planned trip.
&gt;
&gt;Medical issues: After a week on the island, one of the men gets sick. He has a fever, a headache and chills. It could be anything at this point, but the doctor thinks it is malaria due to bites on his arms. He is treated with anti-malarian drugs, but they have no effect on him.
&gt;
&gt;The man then admits that he has painful wounds/swellings in his crotch and that he had unprotected sex with a prostitute before going on the trip. He has also developed muscle pain, which leads the doctor to believe that it is syphilis. The doctor treats him with doxyclycine. This medicine makes him slightly better, but he is still not well even though a single dose of antibiotics should be enough to cure syphilis at an early stage.
&gt;
&gt;Upon closer inspection of the patient’s full body, the doctor notices swollen lymph nodes in his armpits, and when they take off the patient’s shoes they discover that his skin is decaying on his toes (acral gangrene). This in combination with the other symptoms makes the doctor realize that this is the bubonic plague.
&gt;
&gt;They have enough antibiotics for a few more rounds of treatment, but realize that it is already too late for this man as he started showing the first symptoms two days ago. They also realize that what they thought to be mosquito bites on the rest of the group might be flea bites, so there is a chance that they are all infected, and there's definitely not enough antibiotics in the kit to treat all of them.",,False,,t5_2qhff,1365302760.0,,,True,t3_1bswae,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/1bswae/question_about_a_doctor_carrying_antibiotics/,

I'm just about to finish my second year as an undergraduate premedical student and I've recently begun to think about pursuing a temporary career in nursing. The plan is to leave, finish out a BSN program by the time I’m 22, and work until I’m 30 years old before reconsidering medical school. It's not that I consider the job ""easier"" or can't take the premed curriculum - at least, I don't THINK that's why I'm doing it. I’ve worked as an EMT and I understand the profoundly important role that everyone plays at each step of the medical system, and further how each person SIGNIFICANTLY contributes to the efficacy and efficiency of the whole system, and it’s for this reason that I’m considering entering the field of nursing. 

I've spent a lot of the last year studying the basic philosophy behind medicine and historical developments that have led up to modern medical practice (and the problems inherent in it) – with all of the changes that will (hopefully) be coming to medical practice in the next decade or so, I'm thinking now might not be the best time to become a doctor. 

Downvote me to hell if you think this is disrespectful, but I feel like world of nursing isn't necessarily going to be as subject to broad-scale changes as the world of physicians in the coming years. The job of a nurse is to care for the daily health of a patient whereas it is the role of the physician to coordinate curative therapy for the primary disease afflicting the patient – and since we as a society are asking significant questions about how it is most efficacious to do so, on a broad scale, I feel like taking this time to acquaint myself with the interior workings of homeostatic medical care is the best option for me. Learning how to treat patients at the level of a nurse will inform how I care for them as a doctor, and I believe that it will do so in a beneficial regard. I mainly question the choice to become a doctor right now because the mentality and approach to medical care at that level is currently in a state of flux. This isn't a concern about job security or being able to ""handle"" the changes - I feel like being able to examine how it is changing from an outside-in perspective would help me shape the most appropriate response once I'm integrated into the system.

I’m aware this sounds disrespectful, I only now just realized it, but these are my thoughts. I apologize if it seems demeaning.

I am very interested in continuing to learn about the philosophical theory of medicine, as well as getting a proper understanding of healthcare infrastructure and how it’s going to be expected to change, but the medical learning obviously takes priority over either of those personal interests.

I know how to interpret an ECG and most of it makes sense to me eg a long P-R indicates delayed electrical transmission from the AV node. But can anyone explain what causes ST segment changes, ie why in the case of an acute MI is there (often, but not always) an ST elevation? What causes that increase in electrical activity between ventricular depolarization and repolarization? Same with ischemia causing ST depression, why is electrical activity reduced?

Thanks in advance for reading. So my situation is this: my girlfriend and I are both medical students in a long distance relationship (~2 hour flight). We're both at the end of 2nd year, and while I'm preparing for 3rd year, she's about to enter the PhD portion of an MD/PhD. Right now, the plan is for me to match to where she is (a major city), upon which we'd hopefully be able to start a family (I know this isn't a given, and we have contingency plans, but let's assume it happens for now).

My question is, when would be the best time to have children in this situation? As soon as we're together, I'll be a (probable) surgical intern working my tail off, and she'll be doing her PhD. Even if her schedule is a little more flexible than mine, I'm not really sure where the time sacrifices are going to come from. And things will be even more stressful once she re-enters the MD curriculum, followed by her own residency. Would it be better to hold off on kids until our residencies are farther along and we might both have a little time? If I learned anything in med school about this, 35 is kind of the upper limit for women in terms of childbearing. We've dated for 6 years now, and at this point the only reservation we have is how this whole raising-a-family-while-both-crazily-busy thing is going to work out.

Thanks so much for any and all input! Also, any comments in general about the whole job/family balance for doctor-doctor couples would be greatly appreciated!",,False,,t5_2qhff,False,,,True,t3_riyuc,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/riyuc/to_the_doctordoctor_families_out_there_how_did/,

I cannot afford to post his bail, so I cannot get him out.  The corrections facility refused to give him the anti-rejection medications he is prescribed.  They claim the medications are too rare for them to have any stocked even though he brought his medications with him (we confirmed that they do have the medications he brought, but they will not give those to him).  They say that it will take 2 days or more for them to give them anything.  We cannot get any more information about the medication at this time, as to what they are exactly, but my concern is in relation to how much damage, if any, missing his doses for 2-3 days would cause.  We have tried to call his doctor, our doctors, and many other medical professionals, with the response that they are unable to give medical advice over the phone and they end the conversation there.  This is taking place in Florida if that matters.  Please help us reddit, we just need to know what we are dealing with in some capacity.

**update:** The nurse on duty at the facility told us that she agrees that it is ridiculous to put someone in such a situation, but followed with ""he committed a crime and it is ultimately his responsibility"".  Although off-topic, upon further research, the situation is a domestic dispute, in which the state is not charging him with anything, but instead a threat he made in anger, caused his live-in girlfriend to press charges against him.  What happen to innocent until proven guilty?  He can sit in jail for whatever he did or did not do, such is the legal system, but I cannot accept that he would have his life threatened by refusal to medicate for a situation like this.

**update:** I appreciate the advice. We must wait for an update on the situation at this point (they quoted an hour). We finally got through to his transplant coordinator, who told us that in his situation that it is imperative that he get his doses. She referred us to the Director of Nursing at the facility. We called the Director and informed them that they either need to take action and get him the medications he needs, or we are going to report the situation to local news and pursue legal action. Within 10 minutes, they called us back telling us that they sent someone to obtain the medications at an offsite pharmacy, so we are waiting the hour they told us it would take until doing anything else.

**update(1/10):**  He has been given his medications after hours of fighting.  At this point, I am just concerned that other people will deal with the same thing.  Should I still report this to the ACLU or something like that? Or by them giving the medications to him (eventually), do I not have any grounds to complain?

I'm not sure if this question gets asked a lot, but I'm considering going back to school to study medecine.  I've been very unhappy with what I do for a long time, and feel the need to make a change.  I wanted to be a doctor or psychiatrist in the past, and have a friend who has the same plan to go back, so it's really gotten me thinking.  However, there are always complications:

1) I'm 28, so a little older than most, but probably within reasonable parameters.

2) I will have to go to back to school for nearly all of the pre-med courses since my undergraduate majors (accounting and Chinese) were non-scientific.  There seem to be programs that will handle that, but it will add time.

3) My college GPA was only 3.5, from a good state school in the Big Ten.  I was a lazy partier at the beginning (hence not pursuing pre-med then) so my good grades were mostly in my later, more difficult classes.  A lot of medical schools have very high admissions standards.  Would I be able to get into a decent med school with that sort of grades and a work history in entrepreneurship?

4) Med School debt.  I already have about 40k in outstanding student debt, although it's all gov't loans.  If I entered med school at 29, I'd probably not have a high paying job until I'm closing on 40.  This would complicate having a family (no plans yet though) and/or being able to afford a house in a timely manner.  This part I think I can accept, assuming I get a good job in the end.

I've also heard that many Physician's Assistants and some nurses have a very high skill level and can do quite well financially also.  Would this choice offer any advantages to a slightly older student in my position over med school?

So to those of you who have gone through this, any ideas or comments?

So mainly, I'm interested in hearing your opinions on how the MD changed your opinions on what sorts of technologies can be valuable in healthcare, or how change can be implemented, or what sorts of research are worth doing.

I started showing stroke like symptoms, and although my best friend Tucker originally thought I was faking, he describes it as if I had suddenly contracted Down syndrome.  My tongue flipped and I couldn't feel the right half of my body, I couldn't walk, see or speak.  The school nurse thought I was on drugs (I wasn't, and at that time had never done drugs) so they called my grandparents (my father was deployed and my mother was at work in another city).  Some stupid stuff with arguments and whatnot goes on and I end up in the hospital with all of the doctors clueless.  They did a spinal tap (fucking ow!) and several MRI's to find out that the myelin sheath on my brain was non-existent. I had a fairly rare ailment called ADEM ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis#section_4 ), that basically meant that when I had a sinus infection one week prior and was prescribed antibiotics, my antibodies pretty much turned on me and attacked my brain.  All in all, recovery took about 6 months, and I now suffer from a speech impediment and a very fucked up center of gravity ( I'm all off balanced).

TL;DR- I had an ADEM ( http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis#section_4 ) attack and I overcame the 5% mortality rate, which scared me when I first heard of it. Now I'm off balanced with a speech impediment.

On the flip side, there are several people complaining about too much testing being done, like the guy who had two cystoscopies for what ended up being a benign condition.

[Here is my initial doctor visit sans bandages.](http://i.imgur.com/xqHyk.jpg) [NSFL] The huge blister between the toes was caused by the bandage constantly rubbing.

[Here is a closer look at what was taken out](http://i.imgur.com/ZoAF2.jpg), this cauliflower-like material is what builds up between the joints and causes most of the pain.

Unfortunately, all of the things I enjoy in my diet (wine/alcohol, fatty foods and shellfish) are some of the biggest reasons behind excessive buildup of gout deposits.  I am on track to eventually develop arthistis due to the deterioration of my joints.  I am already have problems in both elbows as well as my knees, in addition to my fingers.

I've tried to avoid these false 10's by phrasing my pain assessments differently. ""0 is no pain at all, 10 is the absolute worst pain you've ever experienced in your entire life to date."", ""10 is like walking on broken glass mixed with rock salt"", ""10 is like being buried up to your chin in a fire ant mound"", etc.

I also try to avoid leading patients when asking them to describe the quality of the pain. I never ask a patient if the pain in their chest is ""crushing"" or ""like a gorilla sitting on their chest"". I always give adjectives that are quite bland. ""Can you describe the pain? Is it dull, achy, pinching?""

What's the best, most efficient way to stay up on my game in terms of important studies, medical news, and cool new gadgets? I read NEJM and JAMA regularly, and would love some tips on cool blogs that I could throw into Flipboard and read on my iPad in my downtime (if any if the rumors of the horrors of 3rd year prove true). 

So Meddit, hit me with your favorite sites!

Edit: I understand that looking up disease processes that are relevant for my patients is going to occupy the bulk of my time. I by no means plan on using primary sources. Talking to higher ups, the consensus seems to be to use UpToDate, Dynamed, Epocrates, Diagnosaurus, etc. for the day-to-day grind.

I obviously had the gunner comments coming (my douchy user name certainly isn't helping things). It's one thing to be up on your shit and be ready for pimping (and knowing what's going on with your patient). That's not what I was trying to get at. I truly am fascinated with current trends in medicine, and that's what I was seeking help for. I don't need the details of a new statin study, but I do like reading the tagline for big trials at a BBC level, not a PubMed level. I like reading about the crazy new robot that runs like a human, or how NASA has made biocapsules that might make unmanaged diabetes a thing of the past in a decade. I like knowing about what's going on with ObamaCare and how it's going to affect the way I practice, without the frivolous details of legislature. What I was looking for was a blog type deal that was similar to Lifehacker or Gizmodo, but for medicine. Big picture stuff, that probably doesn't have anything to do with the way I treat patients (protocols, double blinds, etc).

**TL;DR**: People become very angry at free riders who don't contribute to communal systems but reap disproportional benefits. 'Fair' contributors become so angry that they sacrifice their own resources to penalize free riders.

As US medicine becomes more centrally funded (taxes/mandated insurance) do you think this same anger towards free riders will be felt towards smokers, obese, etc being seen as not personally maintaining their health but reaping expensive benefits from public coffers? Will we see coverage changes come about as a result of this?

Believe you me, I'm pretty damn interesting, to say the least.

For a few months now, I've been experiencing some neck and shoulder pain, which I simply shrugged off as a repetitive stress injury from sitting at the computer or maybe a muscle strain from rolling a heavy patient off a backboard. The other week the pain suddenly went from mild-moderate to moderately severe. It made it difficult to sleep, it would wake me from sleep, I just couldn't find any position that provided relief. I again assumed that it was a bad strain, and my refusal to baby it like I should have resulted in me aggravating it, so I took 5 days of Robaxin, did some stretching, and bought a heated neck wrap. No relief.

I finally caved and made an appointment with my internist. We sat down, I explained my assumed mechanism of injury, my failed attempts at self medicating, the standard OPQRST mnemonic, etc. I also explained that I'd checked for Phalen's signs to R/O carpal tunnel causing the radiation, noted a positive Sulcus sign, couldn't palpate any trigger points or AC separation, and did the various range of motion checks you'd do with a patient who presented with a shoulder injury.

His solution: work backwards. Coming from the ED, my mind automatically thought traumatic injury, something acute and most likely musculoskelatal, so I worked up achy 4th finger to my sore trapezius. Coming from primary care, his first instinct was to instead look for something chronic, not traumatic but medical. He checked the range of motion in my neck and noted what was most painful, then palpated each cervical vertebrae. There it was. My perceived musculoskelatal issue was neurological, and the Sulcus sign was just incidental. He pressed on a spinous process, and along with a pop came searing pain in my shoulder that radiated to my last two fingers, a prescription for Vicodin, and a trip to radiology.

**Lessons learned**:

* When we discharge a patient from the ED and tell them to follow up with a specialist/PCP, they really really should.

* Correlation is not causation. A busy shift with lots of lifting patients resulting in increased pain does not mean the source of the pain is the use of the shoulder.

* They're head to toe exams, not toe to head/point tenderness, whichever comes first.

* The ER is not staffed by orthopods, gastros, cardiologists, derms, rads or any other specialty outside of EM and FM. Ortho, gastro, cardiology, dermatology, and radiology are not our specialties and we'll often miss something if we pretend it is.

* When in doubt, refer to specialist.

* When certain, refer to specialist.

* You still can't convince me to take oral steroids ever again. I'd probably wind up with less heartburn after drinking the contents of a car battery.",,False,,t5_2qhff,False,,,True,t3_13i00z,http://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/13i00z/scenes_from_the_emergency_departmentmy_personal/,

After meeting with pre-med advisors I was informed that it would be quite difficult for me to go to med school afterwards for several reasons, one being that schools may not want to take an in-demand pharmacist out of the profession. Well seeing how there is quite a surplus of pharmacists in the field, this should no longer be an issue with that. I just finished my clinicals and graduated in May and am now seriously considering trying to go to med school.

I have a strong passion for medicine (my dad is  a doctor and I only had to hear a few of his stories to fall in love with it) but in high school I fell under the spell of school reputations. I became obsessed with getting into the top, Ivy-League schools, thinking that they could teach me what other schools could not (In a general education sense, I understand that research is a different story). Senior year of high school I realized that learning and education is so much more of what I put into it than it is where I go. That being said, I am not sure whether or not the same realization can be made about Medical School. I do recognize that there certainly is some weight placed in a school's name and reputation, but it is my belief that, pardon my metaphor, a school's reputation gets your foot in the door, but your experience and hard work keeps you in the building. So I'm not sure how I should let a medical school's reputation affect my decision, or if it should affect my decision at all.

TL;DR: From an *educational and learning standpoint*, would I end up regretting *not* going to a 'famous' medical school e.g. HarvardMed, StanfordMed, etc. ?

Edit: Thanks everyone for your thoughtful answers! This is a great community. On the topic of Biochemistry, I took a year of science that did one semester of Ochem and one semester of Biochem. So that did introduce me to it, but the college I'm at right now only offers one Biochem class (I'm currently at a community college) and I don't think it's even the difficulty I need, so I'm going to wait until junior year when I transfer to take my biochemistry. Until then, I'll be exhausting my school's biology, chemistry, physics, and math courses.

On the other hand, if he does have Marfan Syndrome, he might not be diagnosed until it's too late.


Here's some background:

He's 25, tall and lanky with a very narrow face, and eyes that angle downward away from his nose.  He's approximately 205 cm with an incredibly long wing span.  (I don't know exactly how long, but his fingertips extend to his mid-thighs when standing.)  His joints are hyper-mobile. He can bend his fingers almost all the way back.  His fingers also appear to be disproportionately long for his hands.  


He wears contacts to correct an astigmatism. 


Medical hx: acute idiopathic pancreatitis  4 months ago, infrequent severe headaches, and insomnia.  He also often complains about achy joints, and once asked my if it was possible to have arthritis in his hips at such a young age.

Meds: 10 mg Zolpidem.

He mentioned to me once that he thinks he has infrequent heart palpitations, but hasn't seen a doctor for it.

No family hx of sudden cardiac death.  His father and two uncles have both had surgery to correct detached retina.  
He has had one normal EKG while in the ED for the pancreatitis, but has never had an echo.

He is also somewhat of a hypochondriac, and I am reluctant to casually address this issue because I don't want to contribute to unnecessary anxiety about his health.

Your ""math"" is pretty inaccurate and misinformed. Below is an
explanation of my reasoning followed by a suggestion for ""Doctor-Attack
Methods"" that you might find helpful in future arguments. 

Direct patient contact in most US medical schools begins in your first year now
and is continued throughout the second as medical students prepare for their
Step 1 Board Examinations. 

Medical students then undergo 2 years of clinical rotations through primary
care, surgery, elective specialties etc.

Upon finishing their 4 years of medical school, they will apply and attend a 3
to 5-year medical residency as a physician. 

Upon completing their residency they may wish to complete a fellowship (such as Pain Management or Pediatric Emergency Medicine) and will continue their
training for 2-3 years.

Many DNP programs do not require experience as a RN but rather a Bachelor’s in Nursing (a degree rather than experience). 

http://fpb.case.edu/dnp/entry.shtm

http://www.mghihp.edu/academics/nursing/degree-options/rn-to-doctor-of-nursing-practice/default.aspx

Some DNP programs are actually online, negating your emphasis on direct patient interaction.

http://www.capella.edu/online-degrees/dnp-nursing-practice/

http://www.waldenu.edu/doctoral/doctor-of-nursing-practice

http://www.umass.edu/nursing/academics/doctor-nursing-practice-dnp-online

Clinical Education for NP programs is estimated to on average 2,800-5,350 hours.

Clinical Education for DO/MD programs is estimated to be on average
20,700-21,700 hours. 

http://www.aafp.org/online/etc/medialib/aafp_org/documents/press/nurse-practicioners/nurse-practicioners-training.Par.0001.File.tmp/NP-Kit-FP-NP-UPDATED.pdf

In conclusion, you are absolutely incorrect with your ""math"" and anytime I hear a NP gear up a ""we spend more time.."" argument I
simply smile, knowing that they will believe whatever furthers their ability to practice advanced independent medicine. 

Now to help you with this argument I propose the following statements which I
believe:

1. NPs are just as smart as Physicians

2. Physicians are not automatically better than NPs

Now what I think you should focus on is not the amount of training that NPs receive (it is entirely a poor attack) but rather the performance of Mid-Level
providers and patient outcomes. If you take a look at many studies, there is no difference in patient outcome regarding whether or not a DO/MD or NP is
treating.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23247958

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23243110

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23238621

Therefore, instead of trying the 'ol ""we have more patient experience!"" bit, you could instead say ""hey look at the patient outcomes without 2 years of biochemistry and associated sciences, why do we even do that?""

I will say this though. NPs pushing for greater autonomy and responsibility have overlooked I believe is the saddest aspect of medicine: NPs have become simple pawns. 

Don't worry though, Physicians are being chiseled down to pawns. 

Insurance companies and hospitals do not support DNPs or PAs because you provide better care or are more compassionate; they support you because you are cheap. 

You are paid roughly 20-30% less than what physicians are paid, therefore you provide financial incentive to be hired.

However, if you continue your masquerade you will be successful in pushing physicians away from primary care. You will fill the “void” and be momentarily proud.

But then you will realize that you wish to be paid more because ""wow, this is hard."" You will demand to make what the former physicians made (you do the same thing!). You will come together (Nursing organizations are pretty powerful) and you will demand higher pay. 

At that point, your financial incentive for existence will no longer be present, and the studies paid for by hospitals and insurance agencies stating the excellence and competence of NPs will diminish. 

Also, remember now that physician organizations are incompetent when it comes to public relations, but they are learning slowly. Nursing stands currently as the honest and caring profession, but remember that once you change the game and become independent, you will face the same struggles that have demonized physicians. 

Don't buy that BMW, your patients might not believe when you say times are hard.

There seems to be a vocal contingent of people who either hate medicine, or med school, or regret their decision to get into medicine, etc.

Is it just that people are more likely to be motivated to write on negative aspects of things in general? Or is this really *a terrible life to get into*?

I'd really like to hear the flip side. I'd really like to hear the reasons people don't regret getting into medicine. I'd really like to hear about what people *love* about being in medicine.

Rather, I'm questioning those who post articles about their lives being so dominated by their careers that the majority of them are unmarried or divorced, and too consumed by their work to maintain proper balance in their lives.  If you are doctor, does this accurately describe you?  Are most of you divorced/single and constantly stressed?  And how can anyone interested in medicine still desire to go for an MD after receiving such a deluge of discouraging information?  Thanks for reading.

Currently we follow the standard triage protocols, pts are redirected to an appropriate area, treated, then discharged or await admission.

Our ER is undergoing a drastic change in an attempt to combat ever-increasing numbers of daily presentations. The new model: 

* Replaces the triage nurse with a single nurse who sees the patient for a few minutes and redirects them to the appropriate area - trauma/resus, fast stream or assessment cubicle. 

* Each pt is seen within 10 minutes by a nurse and Attending-led team - either an intern, resident, fellow; all pts run by the Attending (Trauma/Resus care does not change, seen immediately). 

* All interventions and assessments are ordered within 30 minutes, and the patient is transferred to a general cubicle or short stay unit and a new team of doctors/RNs. 

* Once it has been determined whether the patient needs admission or discharge, they are either discharged within 4 hrs (where practical) or accepted by the most relevant specialty. Interim orders are written by ER staff. Assuming there are beds, they are sent directly to the appropriate ward prior to seeing the specialty team. They are admitted on the ward.

1. He's completely ""gun shy"" now. I feel like the attention and probation has created a mental block.

He's lost confidence and just goes deer-in-the-headlights to pressure. He gives up easily now. I need to be non-threatening and nonjudgmental. I'm going to have to get inside to make change by being much more Jiminey Cricket/Tinkerbell than Mike DeBakey/Red Foreman.

2. This guy is missing basic, *fundamental* skills and ideas about patient ownership and what it means to be a doctor. I know almost nothing about his intern year, but I can tell he was just treated as a bad prelim, and idly passed along until he left, and I'm frankly pissed that this has gone on for over half a year more. He seems lazy, but I think that's just because he has no sense of ""this is YOUR job"" and ""YOU are in charge of this item"". He feels like a 4th year post-match med student that's still kind of ""checked out"" instead of someone sliding toward their 3rd year of residency. He forgets basic things like lab orders and consults even when I remind him, and when he does call a consult he seems to have fabricated no picture of where we're going with the patient, *why* we're calling this consult, what we want to know, and what we need the consulting physicians to know so they can help us. **He is somewhat disengaged, and seems to be constantly waiting for orders or criticism instead of using his brain to solve his patient's problems and propose new ideas to me.**

He's not the brightest med student, fine. Neither was I. But he's made it this far and I know he can't be stupid. It's just that no one has taught him the gravity of his job. He's not been advanced to the level of a second-year in terms of actively pursuing solutions, and taking ownership as if he were a physician working without someone turning the pages of his coloring books for him.

That last comment was snide, and I don't think of him as a drooling idiot, mainly because if I did I'd just bide my time with him, do all the work, and let him get kicked from the program. I'm too fresh for this to be ""not my problem"". My timestamp of experience is going on his brain, and he is given to me as a resident, so that means he should get more from me than I get from him. He does my busy work, and I take the time to give him my all and make him a better doctor the best way I know how.

Share experiences, please. I was just like he is, but as a starting 3rd year med student, and I can't for the life of me remember what turned me around. At any rate I don't think what transitioned me into ""physician"" back then will work this late in the game for him.

**TL;DR: Bad resident. Doesn't get it. Gun shy from criticism and that's making him worse. Fundamentally lacking, but not fundamentally hopeless, and not fundamentally a bad guy. SRSLY read the whole thing please.**

Appreciate the consideration. Thanks.

**EDIT: I have an idea!** So, most of our patients are new to him, and ALL of the treatment plans have been going 10 days without him. This means he's not gonna know anyone. So, this first week, *he* is the attending and *I* am the resident. Check it: His problem is not knowing what questions to ask to formulate a linear and multidisciplinary plan. *He* is now in charge of asking *me* the right questions and getting the pertinent data from me. Nothing is off limits. The rules are simple:

1. You must first check the copy-pasted assessment and plan and ALL of the relevant notes to see if you can figure out why we're doing/not doing something. He must find the deficiencies and things left undone. He gets to pimp me about why I'm calling/not calling certain consults. They are now his patients, and I work for him (in a sense) but that sets up number 2....

2. Nothing is off limits. The only stupid question is the one he didn't ask that fucks something up. No judgement, no intimidation. If he suggests an alternative I must entertain it and we discuss. 

Obviously, he's going to be doing all the work of notes, consults, and orders. This will put him in a vacuum of direct cause-effect of his patients for the first time. I'm just here for support and guidance!
