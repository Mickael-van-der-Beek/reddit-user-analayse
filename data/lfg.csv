All right, you motherfuckers, here's what this is about. Tired of looking endlessly for a game, or having enough people but no DM? Did you ever wish you could stop reading these kick-ass books and painting these cool minis and just fucking play? 


Then listen up.


I'm basically a newbie in the whole D&amp;D world, having no real idea what I'm doing. I've played maybe 3 mods in my life, and none of them recently. I've primarily played 3.5, but recently I've been looking to play Pathfinder.


BUT:

The closest place to play Pathfinder is 30 minutes away, and the few times I've managed to snake through traffic for an hour resulted in tables being full or not 1st level, people being stand-offish or not showering, or there just not being anyone to DM for a table. I've tried everything, on and off, for the last 6 years: online play, kidnapping strangers and begging coworkers, Play by Post, everything. No dice (hurr puns hurr). 


Needless to say, perusing these boards, many of you come here for the exact same reason I did: You were desperate. Many of you may not live in a location where there's enough interest to warrant a gaming option, or it may not fit your schedule, or blah blah blah.


So here is my solution for all of you, for better or worse: We learn to DM, we get together here or elsewhere online, and we play ourselves some motherfucking D&amp;D (or whatever you're into).


This may be a terrible idea. It may result in rage and tears and hurt feelings and sessions on Oprah (oh wait never mind). But honestly, I'm so sick and tired of hunting and waiting that I've just decided to go out and do it.


**Hypothetical FAQ:**


**What's your background in gaming? How are you the guy to head this up?**

You know what, imaginary person, you're right. I'm probably the last person who should be head this up. I don't have hardly any experience in tabletop gaming, I don't know anything about DMing other than it seems no-one wants to do it, and I don't even own my own dice. Strictly speaking, if you think you're going to message me or get in touch with me and find a guru of online gaming who will supply you with an automatic cure for your gaming drought, I'm here to disappoint.


**If you aren't the person to be heading this up, then why make this post in the first place?**

Because no one else is. That's why.


**Hey! I don't play Pathfinder! How come you said all games available when you're only talking about one?**

Hello. You are now in charge of learning how to DM your game. You're welcome.


**I'd really much rather play. Is there a chance I can join and not really worry about the whole learning to DM thing?**

*Sigh.* You know what? I'll take it. Hell, if I can get 4-6 people who are willing to be guinea pigs while I flounder about with Pathfinder, I'll call this post a success.


**Why should I respond to this message? What do I get out of joining you?**

A fuckload of work and maybe some gaming in between, that's what I'm guessing. I don't expect that everyone will want to put forth this effort. Hell, I'm not even sure this is going to work. It's just the only option left for me. Maybe it's the only option left for you. In that case, welcome aboard. As for how this is going to work, I imagine it will go along the following pattern: 4 people get together, none of them know hardly anything about Pathfinder (for example). They run some encounters, die horribly, and slowly get better. 


**It seems like having all these different games will confuse the hell out of things. Wouldn't it be better if you made a separate post for each game?**

If you want to do it that way, knock yourself out. I'll link to your post.


**Wouldn't this be easier if we had someone with experience help us all learn?**

If we could find someone more experienced, would we really be in this mess? Of course, if any experienced players want to help out, they're more than welcome to. But I see a lot of newbies wanting to get into the game, and not a lot of experienced people around to make that happen. We can all read. Let's break open these books and start playing, instead of just waiting for someone to come around who may or may not have all the answers.


**I don't want to scroll through the comments and find someone to learn with!**

Well, hypothetical person, this is a complaint, not a question. However, At the top of this post I will be making a list of the redditors who are involved in this....whatever it is....and have them organized according to game.


**I don't want to play online, I want to play in person. What does this post offer me?**

An option. You still want to find that magical group? Go ahead. I'd be there already if I could figure out how to do it. The things we learn here will (hopefully) transfer to offline play as well, so while you're waiting you could hang out and learn something. Otherwise, go back to doing what you do.

**I know nothing about (game). Am I welcome here?**

Absolutely. You're the person we want here most. For some reason, you became interested in a game. Maybe someone was playing it in your dorm room one day. Maybe you suddenly discovered that one of your friends has this passion in their life and you never knew about it. 

The reality is that, compared to all the games I've ever seen, D&amp;D (and games like it) has an extremely high entrance bar. You have to find a game, you have to learn about stats, and feats, and skills, and all this other crap, before you can even hope to be remotely competent. You may have been told that in order to play, you have to read all 500 pages of the Pathfinder Core Rulebook (you laugh, but that's what I was told).

Then you have to deal with the frustration of trying to find someone or somewhere to game. Maybe all of this is just too much waiting. Maybe you just want to *play*. 

For better or worse, that's what this is all about. So come on. Join us. You'll only be marginally more clueless than I am.


**Who's us? Is this just you?**

As of making this post, yes. I've made no claims to grandeur. Either you're in or you're out.


**How do I sign up?**

Now you're talking. Just reply to this thread with a short message of what you would like to accomplish and which game you want to learn. ",,False,,t5_2rcvr,1365211989.0,,,True,t3_1bbwt0,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1bbwt0/online_dm_trainees_in_need_of_teachers_students/,

-----

I both play and run a game in an online (IRC) D&amp;D 3.5 system that meets once a week, and we're currently looking to add more campaigns to our organization. We're calling for new DMs who'd like to play in a custom setting.

As a DM you get everything you need to run a campaign, including our support as game staff. You just need to bring your own concept, and we'll do the rest: supply you with players, tools for running the game online, and a forum where you can consult with the other DMs or talk to our community.

As mentioned, several campaigns take place simultaneously in the same custom game world which spans several different cultures and climates (DMs have their pick of setting).

During games we use two IRC rooms, one for out-of-character chat and use of the dicebot (auto die rolling program), and the other room for in-character dialog, actions, and descriptions. Character sheets are stored on our own server in a local copy of 3EProfiler, and we use a program called [Maptool](http://www.rptools.net/index.php?page=maptool) for battle maps.

In case anyone is worried, at no time will anyone ask for any money to change hands. This is purely a volunteer thing for fun.

If anyone is interested email joinseekers@yahoo.com. Sorry about not giving a link directly to the site so you can check it out, but we've found that the rare person who isn't quite a fit for us will sometimes get mad when they aren't assigned to a game.

When you email, can you include the following:

* Full name
* State you live in (or country if you aren't in the US)
* Year you were born (not the full birthdate)
* What days of the week and times you'd be available to play
* How much experience you have with D&amp;D or tabletop RPGs in general, what types of characters you generally like to play, and what your favorite play style is (role playing, combat, puzzle solving, etc...)
* Training slot preference. We have group training sessions Wednesdays at 6 PM PST and Saturdays at 8 AM PST where we train new players on the tools and programs we use, house rules and game etiquette. Training usually goes for 2 or 3 sessions. If neither of those times is good, let us know and we'll try to set up another time.

Would anyone be interested in creating a new subreddit where you can play a D&amp;D type game in the comments section? 

The way I see this happening is creating the whole subreddit in one world, name to be decided later, with a standardized charter sheet. Players fill out the sheet by themselves and when they want to join a quest they can post under the specified quest and the DM will select them accordingly (If you obviously cheated your stats then you won't be picked). DMs would be responsible for indicating their own rules and how long they expect the quest to last. For example, turn length could be like 10 min (meaning everyone playing has to sit and actually play over their computer) or 1 day (for a more long term campaign which allows the DM to go to work in the morning rather than play D&amp;D) and other rules can be set before people even join. 

Perhaps this has already been done somewhere, in which case kindly point me in the right direction.

Haven't played in a while due to time commitments. Looking for an online group, maybe something like a forum where we post our actions etc etc? Not too sure how this would work online.

I don't mind if it's 4th edition rules or whatever. PM me.

**EDIT**:
I used to play in an online group with a forum. I was under the impression that playing via forum posts was a pretty common thing, but I wasn't sure how anyone else did it. 

Well... if we can get enough people into it, and a DM who is interested, I can host the forum on my domain. 

The way it worked when I played via forum was that there was a thread for each character sheet, where the DM could discuss things with you, the first post was always the most up to date character sheet for that PC.

Dice rolls were done by the DM, we trusted him so if he cheated the rolls, it was to give us an entertaining time.

The biggest thing was that we had one big long ""adventure thread"". It was here that the DM would describe the situation and we would post our attempted actions. You kind of were expected to post your actions in a descriptive, novel-like fashion, but you couldn't assume success.

So I might attack a zombie and I would write:

""As my foot touches the sandy ground from the last attack I turn my eyes onto the final zombie. Using the momentum from that last devestating swing I let the sword cut through the air, leaving myself exposed, but hoping for a killing strike.""

And the DM might reply with: ""NeomerArcana's gamble doesn't pay off, the bugbear archer sees open swing and lets lose an arrow. Your swing collapses as the arrow pierces your side.""

To make it quick, everyone would post their actions then the DM would reply with one ""outcome"" for that round. Same in town, everyone would post what they wanted to do and the DM would post outcomes.

Usually the DM would set a time limit based on his own real life circumstances. So he might say, ""post by 10pm please"". Stuff like that.

Let me know if you're interested, or if you know of another way it works, or if you want to DM.

**EDIT** the second:
After your descriptive text, you would also say something like:
""Move to G5 and attack zombie with greatsword""

The DM would also post a picture from a map program or spreadsheet or photoshop file (whatever) of the current position of people.

**Edit in the third degree**

So it looks like there's enough people. I'll get a board set up as best I can and we can go from there. I've decided to act as DM, I've done it before, years ago in 3.0. I'm not sure when it'll start but I'll let you all know the details here in a new thread.

I'm more than happy to allow other games to take place in my board, so if you wanna DM a game just ask. 

I'm good for 3.0 or 3.5 but if you want to use 4th edition I'll need a link to torrent.

It was an RPG in literary form, dubbed the Great War. It included art by one of the participants and made me forge incredible friendships with my players, and we all met up in real life for my birthday and had an amazing time.

Now that the Great War is coming to an end, I'm starting something new. Something much greater, in the sense that it is going to be a merger of Pathfinder and Forum RPGs, taking place in a unique setting designed by both myself and all players involved in the game.

You'll be able to contribute at any time of day across the whole week, so it's very casual in that sense, since it is going to be literary based and hosted on a forum. But it is also a professional endeavour, and will probably include over 10 people at a time exploring the world.

At the end of all this, I hope to use some of the storylines we forge to write a novel based in the setting.

So if anyone is interested, write here in this thread, and PM me your Skype address so we can chat, and I can show you everything that has been put together so far, and you can contribute. We're a team of  6 up until now.

EDIT: Just to be clear, it's a game, but one where we write out what happens, and as GM, I decide the results of your choices and actions. And since it'll include Pathfinder mechanics, you get to train up your characters to meet different challenges. No character shields, though.

Will be running on Monday nights  from 8pm to 12am US Eastern time.  If you have a preference, please let me know! The game will be played using Skype and [OpenRPG Traipse \(Pious Paladin Beta\)](http://www.knowledgearcana.com/traipse-openrpg).

I will be using an alternative dice system that somewhat simplifies and speeds up character creation and gameplay.  Full documentation is available upon request - you don't need to commit to the game before being able to view the materials.  Rest assured that the system adjustments do not change the flavor of the game or even most of the mechanics; it's more about the statistics and averages and so on.  

If anyone wants in, reply here or PM me.

**Edit 1:** A quick bit about the alternate system, without going into too many details:
&gt;The core change that we are testing out with this modified version of Eclipse Phase is a revised die pool system called the Adaptable Dice System, or ADS for short.  The essence of it is that you roll a number of dice equal to your Aptitude then add Skill + Modifiers to the result and try to get a number of successes equal to or above a target difficulty.  How your aptitudes, skills, etc. are determined has been modified slightly for ease of use with this modified system as well as for the sake of simplicity, speed, and ease of play.

**Edit 2:** I currently have 3 players more or less confirmed for the game and am willing to take a few more.  If you're interested, please reply here or send me a PM.

**Edit 3:** I currently have 3 players actually confirmed at the moment and 2 possibles.

Specifics, beyond 3.5e D&amp;D, will be decided after this has two or three days for people to post.

The server runs 24/7, so don't worry about where in the world you are. We have players from America, Canada, The UK, Balkans, etc. How our 24/7 server works is that we have locations as channels in the server and RP is done through there.

Fresh GM looking to run the Only War system in a play by post fashion. While I'd love to run games in a live setting, current circumstances prohibit me from being reliable in any live sessions (baby!). This would be a learning experiences for both me and the players. It will be a alpha test of sorts to get the rhythm and mechanics of the game down for a play by post system, and if necessary, develop homebrew rules to make the game more enjoyable and run more smoothly. I know a lot of players playing live use the maptool system which I am totally unfamiliar with. But I'd like to use roll20 for this, and being a PbP game, it shouldn't be at too much of a disadvantage.

I'm looking for 2-4 players planning to start in a couple weeks or so. New players are welcome as I will be new to this as well. I plan on just starting with one of the introductory adventures with pregenerated characters since this is meant to be more of a one-off adventures to test the system You don't need to have the rulebook with you as basic gameplay can be explained as we go, but having it will be that much better. I'm hoping for dedicated players who are looking to have some fun but are also willing to give comments and feedback towards developing better PbP mechanics. Naturally you wont be required to log hours at a time. I'm hoping for basic activity around once a day/every other day.

My thoughts are to use the virtual tabletop for chat logging important character actions, dice rolling, character sheets, encounters, and maps drawn on the fly. Campaign discussion forum will be used for player actions and ooc inquiries. All the details aren't hammered out yet, but I'm open to suggestions. I don't know what if there's a timeout to the virtual tabletop, but I was also thinking about leaving players on a ""editing page"" while I'm not joined for those who need to access their character sheets, make rolls, look at a new map or handout (things that would also be made available offline).

I'm looking forward to expanding in the future into longer campaigns. There's a lot to explore as an Imperial Guardsman =)

First off we are over at /r/testpbr at the moment, playing a test campaign to try out the idea and see how its all going to work out. 

/u/tSlefh has done an awesome job as out DM so far, not only coming up with daily posts, but also creating character sheets for the players, of which only I have ever played dnd before.

(Sorting by new is the easiest way to keep track of turns in my opinion). So far everything seems to be working well, but we haven't gotten into any combat, and mostly these first turns have been used discovering how the game is played for the new players. If everything keeps going well we will create more formalized rules for posts and create an official subreddit.

I encourage people to follow our game on the game post or discuss any improvements or how you think things are going so far on our discussion post. I also encourage any other DMs who would like to run their own campaign to post, as it is a test subreddit I won't restrict how you run the game or your turns, anything experimental is welcome.

I'm a new DM who is considering running a D&amp;D NEXT campaign using Roll20.  I am looking to see who might be interested.  I already have one willing player, but I'm looking for roughly three more.  New players are encouraged, but experienced players are welcome as well.  It will be a very newbie-friendly group.

The campaign will start the week of June 3rd and will run for several weeks.  Depending on people's schedules, it will be held once a week on either Tuesdays, Fridays, or Sundays from roughly 7pm - 10pm EST.  It's a homebrewed version of the Caves of Chaos campaign.  If the first part of the campaign goes well (roughly lvl 1-3), we might extend the campaign into later levels, which will be a homebrewed version of the Isle of Dread campaign.  It will be fairly roleplay heavy, but it will be accommodating for those new to roleplaying in general.

If you're interested, please comment with your availability, possible class choices (barbarian, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, or wizard), and what you would like to get out of such a campaign.

I have a lot of experience GMing in a few different systems, but I haven't been able to run a game for months. I'm 'testing the waters' to see if anyone is interested in roleplaying over the internet with various services. I've checked out roll20.net, it seems fun. I'm also totally okay with running a game via IM or whatever format people prefer.

I'm not sure if GMs posting is common here here, I didn't see much, but something about my GM experience:
I've been DMing since I was 14 (almost 10 years now)
I can run D&amp;D 3.5, 4.0, pathfinder (my preference), GURPS, d20 modern, BESM, Ex Machina, Silver Age Sentinels, and probably some more I've forgotten about. I live in a CST state and am a full time college student.

I have lots of ideas for games but for a first time group I'd probably run a low level fantasy campaign, most likely in Forgotten Realms (3.5 era).

Thanks for reading!

Edit: Since we did get some interest, I'll post what I'm thinking about for a first game, so you can see if it interests you:

* Starting level 2
* 20 point stat buy
* Average hit points (d10 would be 10, 5, 6, 5, etc)
* All Paizo material that is in the [PFSRD](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/) is available. No third party sources, no D&amp;D books. If you're using something from a funky source like a magazine article please tell me so I can take a look. If it isn't in the PFSRD I probably won't allow it, too inconvenient.
* All forgotten realms races are available (Core plus all racial subraces plus planetouched). I can homebrew a stat block if you want to play something unusual (aarakocra, shade, etc).
* Traits are available IF ANY ONLY IF you provide a background that justifies your trait selection. Even the really good traits aren't that unbalanced, so feel free to take them if you can justify it.

People seem to be most interested in using Skype, so I'll see if I can get that set up. I have class and work today so I won't be available until 10:15 p.m. CST.

Edit 2: Electric Boogaloo. I have returned home from work and I have Skype booted up. I believe you can search for my by my Skype name, which is facebook:peburch. You can also gchat me via sirralen@gmail.com. I will be logged into both of them until 1 am CST at least, for your convenience.

Just a note, we have quite a few more people than can really easily join one game. Don't give up hope! I might quite possibly be able to run two games, or someone else might step up to lead a second game. Get in on the conversation regardless.

Edit 3: First meeting was a success, although I'm still waiting to hear back from a few people. You can PM me on reddit or contact me via skype (facebook:peburch) or via email at sirralen@gmail.com. I'll give people a few days to get in touch with me to see who is still interested. I especially need to know *what days you are available* please send me that information via gmail so I can find a day(s) that works for everyone.

I've been itching for some pen and paper, have played 3.5 as a player and dabbled as a DM and played 4e also as a player. Looking for something new and like the look of Deadlands Classic!

I am happy have a shot at playing DM (Though I have only played DM for a dozen or so times in an offline game with friends) so players may have to bear with me while I get used to everything! Though if there's a more experienced DM that would like to play I'd be happy with that also. I have experience with Maptools so would likely use that, though Roll20 also looks quite interesting.

Would anyone be interested in playing this older game? We could run through a few of the adventures to see how things went and go from there! I'm usually busy during the week but I could happily do a Sat or Sunday game from around lunchtime. Looking for either weekly for fortnightly depending on how busy everyone is.

I like a nice balance of combat and roleplay. I also prefer using text for roleplay (In my experience this helps players stay in character more) and using voice for combat to speed things up. Though voice for both wouldn't bother me either.

My requirements are you must have a decent microphone and are able to play in an environment with little background noise. 

YOU DO NOT NEED TO COMMIT TO A WEEKLY GAME

We will likely not be running an extended campaign right now, I will be mainly focusing on smaller, single session adventures around 4 or five hours long. You do, however, need to be able to commit to a session if you sign up to play it. 

Some of the systems I plan on running are:  

Dungeon Crawl Classics
Pathfinder
Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons/OSRIC
4th Edition
And more...

If you are interested in playing, send me an email or contact me on skype. I would like to have a good sized pool of players.

Hello, I am looking to DM a pathfinder group over roll20 and Skype. It would be meeting once a week, starting in July (time &amp; date depending on players).
This would be an initially no-magic campaign with a little homebrew to fix healing &amp; skill issues. The world resembles actual medieval society and is fairly realistic. I reward clever players with bonuses on rolls or not even needing rolls depending on the situation. (If the player gives an amazing speech but rolls a 1 on diplomacy, he/she will succeed anyway). I am aiming for a solid amount of realism here with the die as judges for unclear situations.

The campaign will require solid role playing skills, and mature players as it is a serious campaign setting. New players are welcome. Each character will be expected to have a backstory and (if you need help) to fill out some questions filling out his/her personality. The game will require a semi-balanced party as there are an equal number of skill, roleplaying and combat encounters.

Here are some links to help get an idea of the gameworld and the minor homebrew changes I have made. 

If you are interested PM me or post here. Feel free to ask any questions, and the documents below are going to be updated more when I get some more free time.

The USS Horizon is a Saber classs vessel that is just starting her journey.

The year is 2382. The Federation and Starfleet have renewed their commitment to exploration. With recent losses to the Borg, Dominion, and the rise of Shinzon, Starfleet is in need of men, women and beings with the resolve necessary stand up for Federation ideals and defend it against all enemies.

Starfleet has tasked the Saber class USS Horizon with a four month mission to explore a region of space adjacent to the Tzenkethi, Breen, and Cardassian borders. Horizon will push back the ""fog of war"", chart this unde-rexplored sector and show the flag when necessary to do so.

There will be few allies in this politically volatile region. The Federation border is an entire sector away - through Tzenkethi space. Although a nearby Bajoran colony may be relied upon in times of dire need, the Horizon will be expected to stand on her on two feet.

**~[Ancra Caligo Campaign Poster](http://i.picpar.com/gqo.jpg)~**

Hello! I'm a fairly experienced GM interested in running an **online campaign of exploration, invention, cultural intrigue, and high-flying adventure, with a healthy dash of city-building and just a pinch of economics**.

I'm in the EST time zone, by the way, though the nature of the game shouldn't put too much strain on players' schedules even if they're halfway around the world.

The system is D&amp;D 3.5, using a variant of the E6 modification.

---

The setting is called *Ancra Caligo*, a world of impossibly tall canyons where vertical cities are carved into the cliffs, and the lush, vibrant jungle basins below are filled with saurian fauna that would put Jurassic Park to shame. The secluded corners of the world (and everything above the canyon peaks) are suffused with the Mists: an otherworldly, ethereal fog that is both the greatest mystery of the world, and its greatest source of power.

Anyone can offer almost anything to the mists, from the prototype of a new invention, to the recitation of a gripping story, to a pistol that was used to start a war. The offering fades into the mists for a moment, then is returned; if the gift was somehow worthy, the item, and the person who offered it, is marked by the mists with glowing, silvery designs. These mist marks unlock some aspect of the mists' reality-editing power for their bearer. Indeed, this is the only way magic (or psionics, etc.) is gained, magic items are created, and experience and levels are garnered (though of course, the people of the world don't recognize those last two as such.) The motivations, if any, behind what the mists choose to accept are a mystery, but they seem to greatly favor new technologies and novel experiences.

The sapient races of the world (Bolds, Crags, Cogs, Grays, and Quills) live in cosmopolitan, rapidly-industrializing cities, carved into canyon walls, spanning between the narrower canyons with massive suspension bridges, and linked together by magically-anchored skyrail tracks. Zip-lines and personal gliders are as common a method of inner-city travel as walkways and roads, and the bustle of industry mixes with the ever-present chatter of mingling cultures. Farmers tend caverns of fungi and magically-bred cliffyaks, while others manage colonies of giant, semi-domesticated bumblebees that carve hives out of solid rock, and hive-mind-swarms of friendly, fist-sized craftspiders spin wondrous silken clothing and equipment in exchange for tasty bugs.

This is an era of opportunity for inventors, scientists, entertainers, entrepreneurs, and explorers, just as it is for would-be skyrail robbers, airship pirates, crime syndicates, and robber barons. There are wrongs to be righted, mysteries to be found, and hypotheses to be tested! How will you change the world?

---

The campaign itself will depend very much on the direction(s) the players decide to take it. I intend for a large part of the game to be playable on a post-by-post basis, in between real-time sessions to cover major events (which will likely be caused in part or entirely by the players' shenanigans.)

The campaign will start in and around the cliff city of Silkspan, a major trade hub and center of industry and culture, though if desired, the focus of your adventures can certainly expand beyond it. Those who are interested will have opportunities to build their own businesses, political groups, etc. Engineering new technologies out of the wonders and magic you discover along the way is highly encouraged.

I'm not sure how many players I want, but if you're interested, or if you just have more questions, feel free to post a comment below! :D

We're calling for new players and DMs who'd like to play in a custom setting. People of any experience level are welcome, whether you've been playing for 30 years, or you've never played a TTRPG before in your life.

As mentioned, several campaigns take place simultaneously in the same custom game world which spans several different cultures and climates (DMs have their pick of setting). The campaigns generally don't touch each other, but they can if the DMs want them to.

During games we use two IRC rooms, one for out-of-character chat and use of the dicebot (auto die rolling program), and the other room for in-character dialog, actions, and descriptions. Character sheets are stored on our own server in a local copy of 3EProfiler, and we use a program called [Maptool](http://www.rptools.net/index.php?page=maptool) for battle maps.

In case anyone is worried, at no time will anyone ask for any money to change hands. This is purely a volunteer thing for fun.

If anyone is interested email joinseekers@yahoo.com.

When you email, can you include the following:

* Full name
* State you live in (or country if you aren't in the US)
* Year you were born (not the full birthdate)
* What days of the week and times you'd be available to play
* How much experience you have with D&amp;D or tabletop RPGs in general, what types of characters you generally like to play, and what your favorite play style is (role playing, combat, puzzle solving, etc...)
* Training slot preference. We have group training sessions Wednesdays at 6 PM PST and Saturdays at 8 AM PST where we train new players on the tools and programs we use, house rules and game etiquette. Training usually goes for 2 or 3 sessions. If neither of those times is good, let us know and we'll try to set up another time.
* Anything else about yourself that you're comfortable sharing.

* Create a character of level 4

* Start with 1,200 gold to purchase armor, weapons, adventuring gear needed, buy whatever you'd like from the PHB1, PHB2, PHB3 (no supplements please, unless the item is class-specific). Keep any gold you don't spend.

* Creating a character using the WOTC Character Builder would be a huge plus so I can load them easily into Roll20.net, or into my own.

I've played on VTT's before, as well as PBP, but this will be my first time GM'ing an online game.  My style is not ""Old School"", I love roleplaying, don't care for ""dungeon crawling"" or loot-mongering, and I don't believe in adversarial GM'ing.  

I've just finished creating a setting that I want to start using for the next few years in both extended campaigns and one-shots.  It includes some custom rules and skill substitutions that I'm using in order to move away from grid-based combat.  Drawing maps requires a lot of preparation that I don't care for, and I like having a bit more fudge to cater to cinematic combat.  Basically, I'm trying to test out a whole lot of different things at once - the Roll20 platform, the house rules, and the ""fun"" potential of my setting.

The feel of the campaign is grim and gritty - not grimdark.  I'm basically going for a mix between Game of Thrones (yes, I realize every GM aspires to that) and Joe Abercrombie's ""The Heroes"" (from which I have shamelessly plagiarized).  

Part of the reason I want to switch to Savage Worlds is to have the ability to kill characters without worrying about having to spend 5 hours making a new one.  I won't be looking for reasons to kill you, but this is a pretty unforgiving setting for players who think they can just go parading around the countryside wrecking and scamming everyone in their path that smells like they have loot.  

The full nature of the plot will depend on the characters the players create, and what they're most interested in doing, but I will do my best to have there *some* kind of plot, even in a one-shot.  

I'm saying ""one-shot"" as a way to cover my ass in case I despise every one of you, but there is a possibility that this could turn into a campaign if things go well enough.  I may run multiple one-shots with different groups and build a pool of players to recruit from.  

We'll be starting at level 1, because I want to run tests at multiple levels to ensure I have a good grasp on balancing combat, and because it'll also be easier for me to learn the system when there's fewer moving parts.  Later playtests will happen at higher levels.  Remember that you're lvl 1 so keep your character ambitions pretty humble.  

If you're interested, the first thing to do is check out the [Campaign Wiki](http://www.obsidianportal.com/campaigns/ashes-of-asgard) on Obsidian Portal.  Post in this thread to let me know what playtimes work best, if you have a rough idea of what you want to play, and we can work something out.  You do not need to have a Roll20 beta pass to participate.  

**Edit:** I should clarify, low magic doesn't mean there isn't magic.  It just means all magic comes with either a huge risk or strict limitations.  Most enhanced items will simply be fluffed as ""well crafted"", and an enchanted item that comes imbued with a spell is going to be rare enough to inspire songs.   Additionally, the enemies you'll be facing will, 85% of the time, be other humans.  There's no elves, no dwarves, no ""planes"", if undead rise it's going to be a big fucking deal, and probably no dragons but I haven't made up my mind.

The story so far:

Telantha was the last known surviving city after a cataclysmic event that occurred 22 years ago, resulting in the instant destruction of the city of Yarsin, the gradual destruction of most of the world and the appearance of a substance known as The Darkness.

With this darkness came horrific demons-- manifestations of the creatures that used to inhabit the world. It took all the effort of Telantha's militia, mages, and priests to keep these demons at bay.

Despite these efforts, a little over 7 years ago Telantha was overrun. Those lucky enough to evacuate from the city fled to the outlying settlements.

Eventually, the survivors came to Aden's Well Outpost, and begged the military to let them in. Reluctantly, the military agreed, but there was a condition: The villagers would all be drafted into the military and are required to contribute to the safety and operation of Aden's Well.

Decide how you will contribute-- will you be a soldier, valiently defending the walls from demons? Will you be a farmer, keeping the outpost fed? Or a smith, desperately using whatever materials you can salvage to keep the military supplied? There are many possibilities. Whatever you choose, your character is a part of something bigger, and their contributions can help the citizens of Aden's Well survive--- and perhaps even reclaim what was lost.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask, as I would be happy to answer them.

 Lands of the Ancients

Stone age fantasy in a world ruled over by relatively weak but more active gods, people live in tribes of 50-200 at most, life is hostile and unforgiving. The world is rife with fear and intolerance, rival tribes are a constant danger, as is starvation, disease and monsterous wildlife. 

Like The Croods, but much darker and more serious.


 Arcane Space

Sailing Ships on currents of magical energy explore the galaxy, the Elven Confederacy police’s the Space Lanes while the ghouls patrol the outer fringes in penance for their sins, all while the Voidborn goblin tribes and the remnants of the Orcish Empire haunt the Kingdoms of Man.

Think Treasure Planet meets Spelljammer


 Primetime Heroes

Magical stadiums house expansive dungeons where teams of professional athlete “adventurers” compete on live pay-per-view for cash and prizes against vicious monsters and deadly traps.

Sort of American Gladiators meets real gladiators with a standard fantasy motif.

The gods are distant. You are not special. You WILL be helpless. You will not wade through the bodies of your enemies as you amass treasure. Instead, you will shiver in the dark, listening to those *things* move about on the other side of the door.  If you're lucky, you'll still be alive in the morning. But make no mistake, there are far worse things than death.

Your end will be tragic.

--------------------

This D&amp;D game will be different than most you have experienced before, and you will need to discard most of your usual assumptions at the door. You will not be an elite hero gathering treasure; you will be someone caught up in things far bigger than you that frankly you had no business disturbing. The world will seem to be against you, and it will be. You will be constantly struggling to survive with what you can wrench from the covetous clutches of fate in a dark world that waits patiently, eagerly, for you to trip up. Then it will pounce, and gobble you whole.

This will not be a power gamer friendly game.  It is not about amassing cool gear and supernatural abilities.  It's about characterization, story, and the agonizing struggle to maintain humanity and hope in the face of insurmountable tragedy. 

Mechanically the game is based on 2nd Edition AD&amp;D, but it has been heavily modified.  Thematically, it is Gothic Fantasy/Horror.  If it sometimes seems more like a Call of Chtulhu Fantasy game, I'll know I'm doing it right.

Instead of recruiting for one of them at a time, I've decided to open recruitment for all three at once and run whichever of them turns out to be most popular.  Each of the three Campaigns should bring something new and interesting to the table, so if you've been looking to expand your experience or try something completely different, this is your chance!

I'm planning on running these campaigns with the Basic RolePlaying system, it's the system used in Call of Cthulhu with some changes.  Of course there would be some mechanical differences between each of the three campaigns due to differences in the setting and content of the campaigns.  No experience with the Basic RolePlaying system is required to join the campaigns!

The three campaigns can be viewed here, click each link for a description of each campaign.  Edit:  All three campaigns now have awesome cover art due to the effort of some awesome anonymous artists!  Thanks to you artists, whoever you are!

[Red Dust - A Gritty and Violent Cyberpunk Campaign set in an Arcology on Mars](https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/6683/red-dust)

[Radiation World - A Conan-esque Science-Fantasy Campaign with Pulp Horror Elements](https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/6684/radiation-world)

[Dungeon Planet - A Realistic Dungeoneering Campaign to test your Logic and Resourcefulness](https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/6685/dungeon-planet)

I hope you are as inspired by reading about each of these campaigns as I have been by creating them.  I would be equally interested in running any of the three campaigns, so I'd like to let the players decide which of the three they'd like to play.

Please respond here or via PM if you are interested in one or more of the campaigns.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Let's make legends together!

Edit:  Changed links to a view link instead of a link to automatically add people to the campaigns and added some details about the Basic RolePlaying system.  Thanks for the tip on the links, theonewhosees!

We are currently 4 players of a starcraft II Clan looking to play some Pathfinder P&amp;P. We have created our characters already to the best of our abilities (which definitly need a lookover by some experienced player) and want to play some Role Play now!

As we are all german players in a german clan and very new to the game (some have no P&amp;P Experience whatsoever), we are looking for a willing Dungeon Master to guide us through the game on a weekly bases.

We plan to play every Wednesday from 7pm CEST till 11/12pm + additional optinal days if everyone has time.

Our goal is to get used to RP and Pathfinder to eventually experience a great campaign over the course of a long time - with you!

As we are new to the game i guess that you should not be new, too, cause we need at least one person who knows if what we are doing is correct and can help us through difficulties along the way.

Again: As we are all german players, you should be able to speak german very fluently, even though you do not need to be german at all or live in germany.

As I have only used roll20.net until now i would suggest using this, but you can take us into any system you want :)

We have one request though:
We want to be able to experience freely with our imagination and not move avatars in roll20.net from hex to hex all the time. It is totally fine and enough if you draw us a quick map paint-style! So please do this campaing and everything with as much free and imaginative as possible! :)

If you are interessted just leave a way to contact you here. We are starting this wednesday 19-6-13.

Hope to find a good DM who wants to have a nice group for roleplaying :)

I'm the only player in my current offline group that is currently willing to DM, so I've been DMing for this group for the past few months. However, in doing so, I've had to design a lot of NPCs, which piqued my desire to create characters. I love making characters, but my favorite ones are aligned against the PCs and don't tend to last long enough to make a big impression.

I can't take it any more. I want to make a character and I want to play as it. Sure, it's fun creating elaborate dungeons, intricate storylines, dangling plot hooks, dastardly villains, and damsels in distress, but I'm getting burnt out. I want to be the hero again. I want to marvel at the mysteries of a new quest, to question the motives of a shifty NPC, to cut a man to pieces without worrying about the feelings of the player controlling it. Know what I mean?

Ideally, I'd like to find a group that meets online 1-2 times per week for several hours at a time. My local group meets on Friday/Saturday weekly and I work days on Sunday and during the week, so I'm mostly available on Sundays and weekdays besides Friday during the afternoon and evening.

If you're looking for another player for your group and my schedule fits with yours, let me know and I'd love to play a game!

tl;dr: LFG for CST, Sun-Thurs 4:00 pm - ~ 2:00 am are ideal times, most comfortable with D&amp;D 3.5 and Pathfinder, but willing to try other systems.

**About me**
I'm 23, I work in software design in Boston and while I'm fairly new to the 40k universe I've wanted to get into it for an age. Currently working my way through the horus heresy series, I'm building an IG army at the moment and have played in a couple different DH games. (And looking for more, ALWAYS MORE.)

I've been running D&amp;D and CoC for years and have played in addition: Pathfinder, Tephra, Shadowrun and bits and pieces of other systems though not long enough to bother naming them. I know the DH system fairly well, but it's still a learning process. Ascension levels and the extended rules books - while not enigmas - require some referencing. Also open to RT, but I know next to squat about that system- so perhaps it could be a slow transition later on.

The games I run are usually run heavy on RP in the mix of RP vs Combat, although I find both are essential for a good game. I'm also keen on the Rule of Cool and am, in all honesty, more concerned with creating a cool story around your characters than pitting you against a rule system.

**About You**
Two things I'm looking for are willingness to commit to consistent weekly meeting time and some kick ass characters. Rather than going on who goes first, pitch some character ideas you'd like to play- either here (or here and also through PM if you has secrets) and I'll have a look.  

Once I've committed I'll be there, but running games can be time consuming and currently I'm still on the fence. Make me regret posting the offer with character concepts SO SWEET I'd feel too guilty to deny you.

Make sure you tell me what you like having in a campaign, what sort of books you enjoy and anything else you want to divulge that might help me sculpt a better world around you.

**In addition** [I've been known to art from time to time](http://imgur.com/a/c4vrV), though nothing extraordinary. If I end up doing this you'll no doubt end up getting crappy sketches and paintings of the occasional character or shenanigan, time willing.

* primarily focused on storytelling, but combat will be included

Ideal players should be active posters willing to post at minimum once a day. Obviously we're not going to kick people out for missing a day but my point is I'm looking for people that are going to be active and engaged more often then not.

As GM I am central US time based but nocturnal and generally will be posting in the evenings and early mornings. Real time skype voice sessions might be held in the future to expedite things if we can find a time that works for most people but I'm not looking for a fixed schedule for that.

Basic premise for the game is the players will be serving a very young Rogue Trader dynasty. The elderly rogue trader currently officially in charge fo the dynasty has devoted themselves to hunting pirates and other enemies of the imperium. This has left them with a great reputation for honor but no real wealth. The basic theme will be grappling between the demands of honor and duty against the need and desire for material wealth.

So far i've got 3 interested, a senschal, a arch militant, and someone undecided. This is still the formative stages so at the very earliest we'll start discussing out of character and making characters sometime next week. Post here or PM me if you are interested.

Update Edit: The current count of interested stands at 7 with Seneshal, Arch Militant, Tech Priest, and Astropath expressed interest. We can duplicate up on classes if folks want I don't see a problem with that. I will also state that interest alone doesn't guarantee a spot as I'm going to make people put together a fairly decent backstory to get in to kind of prove to me that your willing to put in the effort to actually stay with the game. Hate to be a jerk like that but it seems necissary to guarantee the long term health of the game.

Update Edit: If you've expressed interest but havn't gotten me your skype accoutn you need to do so as we're about approaching the cap. If you've gotten me your skype info and i havn't contacted you or added you t the chatroom please ping me here or there.

The new year has got my creative juices flowing and my appetite for roleplaying games increased. The problem is, all my current gamer friends have pretty much stopped playing RPGs in favor of miniature wargames.

I've got a couple of different roleplaying games: Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (my favorite), Gamma World, DND 4e, Pathfinder, and am looking for a group to game with. I'm fine joining an existing group but was hoping to get my own started.

If any of you in the city would like to game weekly or every two weeks on the weekend, I'd love to get in contact with you. I'm in the east-end but can reliably get downtown (was planning on playing at Imagine Games and Hobbies).

I'm thinking of doing a play-by-post format, potentially here in its own subreddit, with possibly a live google+ hangout session if I can make it work.

The game would be very open to player input on story direction and setting. I have a very barebones concept for the setting, but it's very open still. My one hard and fast rule I can guarantee is no orcs/goblins. It's more of a post-Arthur Camelot kind of thing with lots of malicious fae.

Anyone interested?

EDIT: I guess so!

First, some more information since I originally posted this on my phone and linking was hard. You can read about Dungeon World on their [website](http://www.dungeon-world.com/). If you're so inclined (and I would generally recommend it since it's a fantastic read and value for the price), you can purchase the complete pdf on its [rpgnow page](http://www.rpgnow.com/product/108028/Dungeon-World?src=FrontPage). 

You definitely don't need to get the book to play though. Instead, take a gander at the class playbooks [here](https://github.com/Sagelt/Dungeon-World) along with the **free** and **legal** version of the rules. 

I think it might be possible to play this with its own subreddit for play-by-post. I think it's at least something worth giving a try. Something to keep in mind for the game is that each Class is unique. There's only one Wizard or Fighter in the world. To paraphrase the book, there may be other magic users or people good with a sword, but none of them are the Wizard or the Fighter.

So, take a look at the playbooks linked above, and post a response to my question below after your post showing interest telling me what class or classes you'd be interested in playing. 

**NEWEST EDIT**
I think I'm going to call it a day on recruiting at this point then to see where we're at. 

Well it looks like I've got a good list of players:
Befriendswbob
kellkore
Callmewolverine Paladin or Rogue
thedark1owns
robdizzledeets

Let me know what classes you might be interested in playing. The eight classes for Dungeon World (DW) are: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Paladin, Ranger, Thief, and Wizard. Again, each class is unique, so no doubling up! We don't have any particular need to have specific roles filled out. For example, if we don't end up with either a fighter or a paladin, we can still have a good party without a traditional ""tank"". 

I'd like to take discussion with the five of you to talk about the game more in-depth somewhere else so I don't just keep editing this post. What we could do is go to rpg.net at their [roleplay-by-post forums](http://forum.rpg.net/forumdisplay.php?31-In-Character-and-Out-of-Character-Threads). I'd also be happy to set up a private subreddit as I mentioned above. I'm not sure exactly how that would work, but it could be interesting to see. 

If you're in the list above, please PM me with 1.) what class you'd like to play and 2.) where you'd like to play online from the two options above or if you've got a third idea.

I am planning on running a Savage Worlds campaign on roll20 on Thursday evenings ~8:00 or 9:00 PM EST (Starting November 1st). I will be using Skype instead of roll20's voice chat, so I would prefer if the interested players have a mic or headset of their own. I currently have around 2-3 players that I played with before already, so I am looking for two or three players to round out the group. The setting will be Tour of Darkness, from the Weird Wars series. In a nutshell, it will be Vietnam War meets weird shit going on (think Call of Cthulhu). The flavor text from the sourcebook is:

""Our first follow-up to our smash hit Weird Wars in the new Savage Worlds system takes us to the jungles of Vietnam. Your grunt has 365 days and a wake-up to learn what really lurks in the jungle. Surviving is tough enough, but if your GI is really on the ball, he just might get drafted into the super-secret Phoenix Program and discover far more than he ever wanted about the Plain of Jars and the secret cults of the high mountains. Tour of Darkness features new Sanity rules and how to deal with mind-numbing horror, a ton of Edges &amp; Hindrances, new horrors, and an awesome Adventure Generator and Plot Points to tell the most savage of tales! Written by the mysterious Teller!""

As for my DM style, I am generally just build a relatively free roaming ""world"" with specific content and let my players roam wild. I am also okay with most characters, as long your character can somewhat work together with other human beings. Feel free to post below if you are interested, or have any questions.

If you have any questions or comments, leave a comment below or contact me on Skype if you want (Whatsimplethings)

You can sign up by putting your Screen name and best Email, Messenger, or Reddit name to contact you on in the doc.




OK UPDATE: I will be using Roll20: https://app.roll20.net/join/39124/LY0IWg this will be the link.

Characters will start at Third Level: please have a basic background story at least, the better the background story the more bonuses I'll give the character. Submit all characters to me via Email to Whatsimplethings@gmail.com. If you want to do something creative, also let me know, Odds are it's ok just TELL ME before you decide to be a demon or whatever the fuck. 

In addition when it comes to skills, the more specialized something is the more ingame bonuses you will recieve for ie: one player wants to be a Weaponsmith instead of a blacksmith, as such he cannot create armor or tools, but receives a bonus to weaponsmithing and will be able to create more specialized weapons ingame. If there is a skill you want to do something similar to: please let me know via Email or Skype or however else you can contact me.

IMPORTANT NOTE: there will not be many magic users, two , maybe three if someone comes up with a damned good backstory. but one slot has already been taken, first come first serve. (clerics and paladins do not apply to this)

Good Afternoon [r/lfg](http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg),

I'm starting a Dark Sun campaign this Sunday 09/09 and am looking for one to two more players to join the group. Here's some basic information:

* Time: Every other Sunday from 3 PM to 7 PM CST
* Where: roll20
* Setting: Dark Sun, starting in Tyr
* Starting Level: 2
* Allowed Material: All material is allowed so long as it fits the setting and your character background. I'm all for optimizing your character but I'm not a fan of cheesy builds and may retroactively decide to disallow material if something sneaks past me. I'm relatively new to 4e and haven't DMd in years so I ask for your patience :).
* Style: I like to balance roleplaying, skill challenges, and combat in my games and will do my best to cater to the interests of my players. Please let me know what your favorite aspects of the game are!

The first adventure will be focused around one of the merchant houses in need of the assistance of a mighty group of adventurers. If you aren't familiar with the Dark Sun campaign setting I suggest either finding the source book and/or reading [these informative and entertaining blog posts](http://community.wizards.com/alphastream1/blog/2010/05/24/traveling_the_athasian_wastes).

The first session will begin one hour early, starting at 2:00 PM CST so that the players can describe their characters and develop a logical reason as to why they're traveling together. [Chapter 4 of Gamemastering](http://www.gamemastering.info/) is a fantastic and free source of suggestions on character creation and I encourage you to check it out. 

The three players who have already committed to the campaign have expressed interest in playing an artificer (refluffed to fit the setting), a rogue/thief/sneaky class, and a warden.",,False,,t5_2rcvr,1347125655.0,,,True,t3_zj2s8,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/zj2s8/online_biweekly_dnd_4e_dark_sun_looking_for/,

ROUND 2.,C_Caveman,10,2,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/wq08s/online_dd_4e_dm_and_2_players_looking_for_4_more/,"The title says most of the information you would need but allow me to clarify the type of player wanted. Please read all the points below to avoid complications later on. (This is the second time around for me since people started to not communicate what was happening and which is why rule 3 is very important).

1. You do not need any experience to play in the group. I am more than happy to teach anyone the basics in a non-boring way. Be aware that 4e is a rule intensive game so I would suggest reading up between sessions and really knowing your character so combat goes quickly.

2. Roleplaying &gt; Rules all of the time. I am a rules lawyer when it comes to 4e but if someone wants to do something cool or interesting that isn't ""by the rules"", then roll that dice. ""I want to use the table as a launching pad to stab the guy on the second floor and land on the baddie on my way down."" ""Well roll twice.. ok a 19 and 14 is enough to do it. Describe how you kill both of them.""

3. MOST IMPORTANT: If you post here, please make sure you are free that day, every week. You need to be able to make time for this as if this was a weekly thing you did with your buddies in real life. You would need to be able tell your friends that want to party, that you are busy that night.                                                                                                                                                                This does not mean that you can't go to your grandma's funeral, your brother's birthday or even hang out with some friends once in awhile. Hell you can miss 1/2 the games but it is fine as long as you tell us in advance. Just be aware that there are 5 other real people who want to game, so if you promise to be there and skip out, you are ruining the time for other people. Again, you do not need to be anti-social, just be communicative and understanding with us.

4. We will be playing on roll20 to play the game. You can go [here](http://roll20.net/) to figure out more.

5. If the above sounds like something you would be interested in, reply in this thread that you can make a certain time (No PMs). If there are already 4 replies to this thread, you should still reply as it is more than likely that I will not get responses from some people (If there are 20 or so replies though, I wouldn't hold your breathe).

I would like to get started again with a group of preferably 3-5 players for a once a week session over Skype.

I play in a homebrew world so anyone interested would need a little bit of a primer from me before creating any characters. Among the things my campaign has are:

* Slavic/Teutonic hybrid human culture on a religious Crusade.
* Druidic tree worshiping orcs.
* A Dwarven kingdom full of Tibetan style Lamasaries. 
* Persian style and mercantile human culture.
* [Maroon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maroon_%28people%29) wild elves living in a giant forest.
* Turkish/Mongol hybrid Goblinoid and Ogric hordes.
* Indian cultured humans of an advanced but waning civilization.

I've been playing evolving this world for a bit over 5 years so I'm familiar with a good portion of it. Although it's not so set in stone that certain things can't be altered. 

I'd prefer newer or inexperienced players as that is who I'm used to, but anyone is welcome if they have interest. If there are any questions about the world you can ask them in here as well. This is my first time posting here so go easy on me.

About us: We have a very heavy emphasis on roleplaying, and story telling, we speak out loud what our characters say, in first person. We want to tell a kick-ass epic, grand story, that will last a long time and not necessarily just kill everything.

We expect you to be too. If you've never done a ton of roleplay before, this may not be the game for you.

Communication and punctuality is SUPREME, and we quickly lose our patience with players who are flaky. Can't show up? Let us know!

The party and Players:
We are effectively level 5, emphasis on Neutral characters, with one evil (Who isn't very evil to be honest). They are as a Rogue, with a heavy artistic bent, we have a sorcerer following the draconic bloodline who's not sure what she wants to do yet (This player is inexperienced, and we want to surround him with experienced players). The last one is the not very evil, Half-Fiend Fighter who is out to make a lot of money.

We are playing pathfinder, and we are using Monte Cook's excellent Ptolus book for the city we're playing in. We have just purchased it, and are still getting to know it. We use Skype and D20 pro, for maps and tactical combat (We're still getting to learn D20 pro, if you're familiar with it, awesome you can help us.)

We're flexible with classes, and we are aware of class short-comings and will work with you if you have a great concept in mind to achieve that. Keep in mind, combat and dungeoncrawling is not the big focus in this game (but that could always change).

Interested? Awesome! Post here, let's chat about this, and make sure we fit one another's gaming styles.

Edit: Making it look sexier

I have found the staff to be very friendly and the core members of the group, likewise. However, there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of activity lately and it could use a serious infusion of new blood. 

It has very deep lore (the game is over five years old, I believe, and the game master is a novelist). Currently, some of the bad guys in play are the [Darklings,] (http://cruinthe.proboards.com/thread/2983/darklings) of which I am an Alpha, the soon-to-be notorious [Na'Tul.] (http://cruinthe.proboards.com/thread/4852/hand-feeds-natul?page=1&amp;scrollTo=26593) Think [this lovely fellow] (http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5du34lcGh1qa8kwko1_400.jpg) and you'll sort of have an idea where we're going with this. The world is currently in a transitional state to tone down the combat math a bit and generate new content, so it's the perfect time to join up and influence new directions in the game!

The only problem is, I am literally like one of the only villains on the board right now, and if we're going to stand any chance against the forces of good, we need more bad guys! Plus, it's hard to RP with folks when most of them want to...you know...kill you. And the feeling is mutual. 

Of course, if you are over-the-top a knight of pure heart, then don't let me stop you from joining anyway! There are many races to choose from and plenty of opportunities for RP, all over Cruinthe. Chaotic neutrals and alignments of every stripe also welcome. There are a bunch of class types to choose from.

Check it out. ;)

In our game you don't need to chase the players and look for new ones when someone needs to drop: there are 3 candidates for every 1 opening and we'll quickly assign a new, qualified player so you can busy yourselves just with running the campaign and not managing the player recruitment.

We'll give you everything you need. 3.5 source material (5th playtest edition is also an option); maptools for online maps + a huge pool of ready maps that you can customize to your needs; ideas for a campaign; chat rooms to host the game (they come with a bot for rolling dice); online character sheets; and generally the freedom to run a campaign that can last for years without breaking up. The game is running since 2004 and many campaigns last 4 years or more. It's really up to the DM.

Yes, you can come with your own content; we'll just tell you about the meta-world and suggest where your campaign can fit. Or you can use one of 5 regions currently in play, and base your campaign on rich content already created by some other DMs.

Our Friday 6-8 PM Pacific game is missing a DM: the current DM can't continue and we have 4 awesome players really looking for a great DM.

If you can't do Friday, that's fine. We'll allow you to open a new 2-hour weekly slot at a time of your choice. EU-friendly time slots are also an option because we have lots of player candidates from Europe.

We'll be playing with an EST schedule and I can work with pretty much any day where we can get 8-ish people to agree on. Post if you're interested and add me on Skype (TangerinesandOranges) so we can hopefully get a good schedule worked out before starting, and then hopefully start next week at the earliest.

Also if you add me on Skype, please tell me who you are on Reddit. Thanks.

EDIT:
Alright I had 11 people total contact me as well as post here. That's quite a lot, and having all 11 on 1 day might make a session really chaotic, so we might have to have 1 of the more experienced guys run a sidequest as a sub-dm (which I'll walk them through) if all 11 of you show up. But from experience, that'll seldom happen (may I regret these words)

(Some of us have watched Roll Play by itmeJP and others have a general knowledge of the game).

We would like to talk in Skype and use Roll20 if the DM wants to. We've not made characters yet, but all understand the general idea of what we'd want. We don't mind which edition the DM wants to play because we've never played any before.

If any available DM's want to chat in Skype with me to sort it all out or ask me any questions, that's fine by me. If anyone wants to help us out and play with us, just reply to this thread and PM me. I don't check my messages on Reddit often, but I'll keep this thread open, so I'll see updates here.

We will all play the game properly, role play (hopefully) everything properly so no random NPC slaughter and we'll try not to deviate from your storyline, unless you tell us you don't mind if we explore cities.

We're all really flexible, so just reply and we can talk on Skype so we can talk proper. 

We're GMT time and we've not got a definitive time yet. We're pretty much all free for the next 5 weeks, so you could tell us your preferred times. Preferably, nothing after 10PM, because we enjoy sleeping.

1374712631.0,7,self.lfg,1iztwc,[GURPS]Need a player or two for online fantasy campaign.,Squishyish,10,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1iztwc/gurpsneed_a_player_or_two_for_online_fantasy/,"Just recently started a sandbox style fantasy rpg campaign using GURPS. Unfortunately two of my four players backed out before the first session, so it ended up running as a two-player + GM game. This isn't ideal for me, so here I am looking to potentially recruit a player or two.

The setting is all homebrew with lore, houserules, character creation guides, etc all put up in a google drive folder that all my players have access to. This is an online game so we're using the Roll20 virtual tabletop for the actual gaming.

My GMing style is very open, but I have a pretty heavy interest in the tactical combat offered by GURPS so it is going to be an important aspect of the game. Don't let this scare you off if you're not very invested in combat as neither of my current players place it as a very high priority either. It won't pop up more than would be fun for the players, regardless of my own interest in it.

More specifically, I'm looking for a player that is able to create fun for themselves in a very open sandbox environment, who is patient, and who is socially competent. None of us have extreme roleplaying backgrounds so you don't have to either, but that does not mean that we don't place heavy emphasis on it. To expand upon my first point, it is crucial that any would-be player is able to have fun via their own imagination. This is absolutely not a railroad campaign, and as such it does not present as much pre-packaged fun. While I will do my best to provide plenty of hooks, you must still seek out what interests you on your own while at the same time being able to accept and participate in group decisions on the direction of the game.

You do Not have to be familiar with GURPS to apply. All three of us are new to GURPS, this being our very first campaign using it. We've only done one session, to give you an idea. Also, I'm a fairly new GM, and as such this will be a learning experience so don't expect a masterpiece of storytelling. I'll do my best. Nothing more, nothing less.

We would like to play once per week on Friday nights starting at around 8PM Pacific Standard Time/Pacific Daylight Time. The sessions will last ~3 hours each.

If you're interested feel free to post here or message me directly.

Unfortunately,this is a campaign is for experienced players only, at least a few games under your belt.


Now,  to get your name in the raffle or secure yourself a spot, I want some backstory and it  will be used in someway. (1-2 Paragraphs is fine, the more the better, and remember your kinda a bad ass at this point)


Now, I'm not saying roll your character sheet right now, but at least come up with a character Idea.


I'm going to ask that you stick to Greyhawk races, some of the odd races or anything that isn't standard needs to be cleared by me.


Classes need to be cleared with me if they are not SRD 


I'm pretty open on flavor/homebrew classes as long as you can argue their place in the party.

In most places, the Fallen World is only called such figuratively. That isn't the case in Troy, New York. Troy is a fallen city in the most literal of senses. There, the mundane is a perfect analogue to the Supernal in this regard. And, yet, Mages flock there.

There are beautiful, massive churches built with fine details in them, using quality materials. Antique windows made by Tiffany &amp; Company are one hooligan with a rock away from being shattered. And, worst of all, most of these buildings are abandoned.

One hundred years ago, Troy was a city for rich and important people; successful bankers, investors, technicians, doctors, lawyers, and so on. But the people that live in Troy now (in those few buildings which have not been abandoned yet) are welfare recipients, hookers, drug dealers, and other ""disposable"" people. The streets themselves, even, are flooded by homeless beggars, just waiting for a handout.
Truly, ""fallen"" is the only word that can describe this city.

**Theme: Abdication**

Everyone has those moments of contemplation where they convince themselves that they were here to do Something Important, that their lives have meaning, and that without them, the world would simply not be the same. This is true, at least for those souls that have Awakened, and they try to act on it. But then they get mugged, and hand over the package they were tasked with delivering instead of fighting for it; they walk into a bar and get drunk instead of using their Magic to spring their buddy from jail for fear of legal consequences; they reveal information that must not be spoken for a few quick brownie points. Most Mages who behave this way try to justify it on humility, on ""knowing their place"", and on Wisdom, but the truth is that they are simply too lazy, too scared, or too petty to fulfill their own destinies.

**Mood: Pettiness and Grime**

Mages here aren't just disinclined to make themselves great for various reasons. They're also concerned that someone might pick things up where they left off. Being one-upped is a hit to the ego, something many of these Awakened individuals feel entitled to, despite their mediocrity. They want to be mediocre, boring and conservative and yet they want to be treated like and regarded as rock stars by the people they meet. They want their cake and they want to eat it, too. When someone starts shining and showing off the results of their Supernal overtime, these people start scheming to take that person down.

**Joining the game**
Send me a private message with your character idea, or something. Instead of making this an overcomplex, bureaucratic process, I'm going to ask that you simply be creative. Send me a blurb about your character's concept, write a one hundred word story about him, draw a picture, write a blurb about his personality, whatever. Submit something interesting for me and other people to enjoy. Whatever you do, don't send a character sheet with no personality, though. There are some house rules I use (which will be explained after selection).
You will be contacted if you are selected for this game.

1373847349.0,7,self.lfg,1ib1bg,[Online] Looking for players for a FATE based cyberpunk game on Sundays.,Monagan,8,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1ib1bg/online_looking_for_players_for_a_fate_based/,"**//edit 2:** For now, I'm sorry to say that both slots are filled. I will edit this post again should one of the players change their mind, but for now, we're full. Thanks for your interest.

Hey there /r/lfg,  
  
A couple of friends and I are setting up a game based on FATE Core, and we need about two more players to fill up a decent group. The first game will be the coming Sunday, starting somewhere around noon and lasting until about 4-5 PM US Central time. We will play this one session and test the waters, see how the chemistry within the group is and, if all goes well, continue on a bi-weekly basis after that.  
   
As far as mechanics go, you should know the barebone basics of FATE Core, which is available as pay-what-you-want in pdf form, but don't worry about that too much for now - since our mechanics are also slightly altered we can go over all of that once we actually get down to making the character sheets.  
   
For now, if you are interested, all you need to do is shoot me your basic character concept in the comments or preferably in a private message (using the basic setting outline below as a basis) which should contain at least a few sentences on your character's motivations, personality, appearance and if applicable special powers (mutation powers as explained below, implants, etc). The two other players will be playing a rogueish, fast talking mutated hacker from the slums and an empathic spiritual healer / new age priest from the wilderness - if that affects your choice of character. If you also want to add a little bit about yourself, what you're looking for in a game, and so on, I'll gladly take that into account as well.    
  
If you have any open questions go ahead and ask, I'll get to them as soon as possible.  
  
**Now, for the basic outline - the setting is homebrew - here's the basics**:   
  
About 100 years in the future, mankind has developed into an advanced high-tech society, taking the first steps into intrasolar space travel, as Earth is hit by a cataclysmic event. I'll stay scarce on the details, but needless to say it kills off a large portion of the human population. Australia basically becomes a complete hell, and the rest of the world isn't much better off, with strange phenomena and widespread destruction.   
  
The game will be set in the remains of the United States, 150 years after the Event. The remaining humans have recovered somewhat, living in only a handful of big and very advanced cities that survived, run not by a democratic central government but by an alliance of corporations. You will find yourself in one of those cities.    
  
One of the major effects of the Event was the emerging of what appears to be magical powers - a mutation that enables abilities ranging from tele- or pyrokinesis to superhuman speed, strength or intellect (You have more or less free reign of what kind of power your character might have, but it should be somewhat specific and you only get one). A significant portion of the surviving population was affected right after the event and, through an unfortunate side effect, immediately turned psychotic, attacking those unaffected before withdrawing into the now mostly empty wilderness between the cities. Later on, other humans within the city started exhibiting those powers as well, but managed to maintain their sanity at first.  
  
However, many of them eventually turned psychotic as well, shooting up whole neighborhoods before either fleeing the city or being killed. Because of this, the unaffected population is generally hostile or at least weary towards the Mutants (which aren't recognized as Mutant just from their appearance alone), and the corporation run local governments are starting to implement more and more drastic measures to contain the threat, leading to resistance and even insurgency from the mutated (but still sane) population.  
  
That's about all you have to know about the setting for now - you'll get the more detailed version as we go along, but I didn't want to cram it all into one post. Again, if there's any open questions, I'll be answering as fast as I can.  
  
**//edit:** I should point out that I'll edit this post when we're filled up so people don't have to bother (still got room for now), but I'm not going to admit anyone without at least a basic character concept as described above.

As a primer, I should say that I'm relatively new to the 40k universe. While I have a good handle on the basic fluff, don't expect me to know exactly how many skulls Khorne is sitting on or what chess game Tzeentch is playing now. 

I've been a DM now for about 5 years, mostly in 3.5/4th D&amp;D. My style of play involves, and heavily rewards, roleplaying, but that's not to say I don't make combat happen/interesting. Granted, the first couple go arounds of BC combat I'm sure I'll mess something up, so be prepared for a fast &amp; loose interpretation of the rules. 

That all being said, here's what potential players should do/know:

* I do not know WHEN we'll be meeting, but it will more than likely be **either Wednesday or Friday evenings EDT/EST (GMT-4/-5)**
* I will only be taking **4** players. Do not be discouraged if I've talked to more than 4 people, since I won't be making the final decision until I have everyone's backstory in hand!
* The main game will be run through **roll20 and Skype.** The in-between fluff RP will be run through **Skype and a Subreddit**, the later of which will be made once the group gets going.
* A microphone is **required**, as is common curtousy when using it
* **Powergamers/Metagamers need not apply.**
* **Newbies are welcome**, though I can only teach you so much.

If you've gotten this far, [take a gander at the actual Roll20 page](https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/6393/black-crusade-for-the-god) and post up an application. I'll also answer whatever questions you may have here in this thread.

Applications close on the 8th, or when the slots have filled. I know it's a bit much to say/ask up front, but I like making sure people know what they're getting into!

Hey folks, US West Coast here, -8GST. I'm looking for a Shadowrun game online.

I'll cackle with glee and toss stunbolts galore when you need them. Street sammy? That mage won't even know what geeked 'im. Hacker/Technomancer? I'll see you guys after the run, try not to scratch the paint on the drones, mmkay? Face? I'll be charming, conniving, and diplomatic. Or at least I'll try.

What's more, I'm willing to back any of those rules-oriented roles up with a detailed, motivated personality, complete with mannerisms and backstory. That's right--the only muderhobo you'll get from me is a murderhobo you ask for. 


**What I'm looking for:**

Pretty much anything that says SHADOWRUN on the tin, although I'd prefer a group that's going for a longer-running, story-oriented campaign over a one-shot.

I'm looking to use maptools and Skype, unless anyone has a better suggestion. 

I'm looking for 4-6 players of all experience levels :D. 

With SAGA, the classes are very balanced and Jedi do not steal the spotlight. Depending on the party, the Jedi/Sith might not be a problem. If people are looking for a Scum/Villainy game, I love that type of game as well! 

I'm new to maptools, but have ran numerous SAGA games. 

The game would take place during the dark times. This is set in between episode three and four, when the Jedi are being purged. It is a pre-made campaign called Dawn of Defiance. 

The game wouldn't start until end of April/early May. 
This would be my first online game so bear with me. I'm in the Eastern time zone. Message me, or post here if you're interested! Looking forward to hearing from you.

Edit: Throwing up some extra info. I will add all Skype/Steam handles when I get to a computer.  I have decided to run the Dawn of Defiance game set in the Dark Times. I haven't ever done and online game before and having a premade campaign would be helpful. If that is a problem, PM me. 

Here is my tentative list of players. It was a first come-first serve basis. Sorry If you didn't make it! Maybe next time! 

* Kadaga  
* liamt25  
* Xjalnoir (VoidPhoenix)  
* Fenrirr

1364152847.0,6,self.lfg,1axe3a,[Online] LF1M 4E Starting at Paragon Tier,Buckwheat530,7,1,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1axe3a/online_lf1m_4e_starting_at_paragon_tier/,"I run two Roll20 4E groups that run ""parallel"" to each other. The setting is a homebrew, Post-Apocalypse fantasy where it has been roughly a century since the world went to hell. There are no kingdoms and the scattered villages that are still around are pretty much just advanced groups of survivors. The setting's gods are rumored to be dead or completely missing from daily life. Dragons haven't been seen since everything happened. Civilization is set to make a comeback (in very minor ways) in the next few years, but events that are transpiring may take the doomsday clock all the way back to 0.

If you're accepted in, you'll be joining Group 1. Group 1 has been going since level 1; from the start there have been 4 core PCs and an ever rotating 5th spot (not on purpose). This group is very laid back and the campaign is often story driven. We're hitting the ending of our Heroic tier this week and the latest 5th needs to bow out due to scheduling issues. 

Their heroic tier started out with the characters being thrown together by fate and were never given the opportunity to separate until part way through and decided to stick together to survive; despite the setting taking place 100ish years after the apocalypse, the world still hasn't gotten its act together and it's dangerous to travel alone. Far Realm corruption is a growing theme in the campaign and there is a large arc related to the return of the dragons coming up.

If we can, we would like a permanent 5th going into the Paragon Tier. The group has been friendly to those new to 4E, but we would prefer our newest member to have some experience (many in this group are just about the novice level and having someone who can help out would be lovely). This isn't required however as, like I said, we're very laid back.

Also, we could really use a Leader class. The first person to leave was our Cleric, then the person that replaced them and subsequently left was a Warlord, and our most recent casualty is our Bard. We homebrew combat to be on the easier side (though not too much more than 4E already is), so this, just like the prior experience, isn't a requirement, simply a plus.

Lastly, the only true requirement, we meet Sundays from about 1pm - 6 or 7pm EST. We have non-US players, so we understand everyone's time needs and try to be flexible to everyone. This has worked well so far, but it often causes our pace to slow down. We usually meet weekly, but will often have to take a week off every month for one reason or another.

As I said, this is one of two groups running parallel, so there's the added thrill of seeing how that plays out. Group 1 walks the Neutral/Chaotic line very closely, while Group 2 is more of a Lawful Good/Neutral group. I'm desperately waiting to see what happens when their plotlines start butting heads. I run my campaigns more along the story driven side; I'm a big fan of ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style games in general and I like to be able to truly have choice and consequence in a way not possible in video games today.

I look forward to hearing from everyone!",,False,,t5_2rcvr,False,,,True,t3_1axe3a,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1axe3a/online_lf1m_4e_starting_at_paragon_tier/,

* Roll20.net account, very simple to obtain and use.
* Skype for voice communication, I don't trust Roll20's voice system.
* Basic, working knowledge of the Pathfinder system.
* Willingness to work together with your fellow PCs.
* Generally positive attitude.

* Everyone starts as a level 0 Human Commoner with pretty low stats that increase via plot development.
* ""Banned"" Classes: Bard, Cleric, Wizard, Cavalier
* Hero points will be used in the traditional Pathfinder sense.
* Gameplay will be about 50% Combat, 50% RP.
* As your future DM, I reserve the right to remove any player from the game for whatever reason and for however long I should choose.

I should have everything sent to you by tomorrow. Thank you all, and if you are a DM/GM: step up, and consider hosting a game for this community. There is a lot of demand and only a small supply of DMs right now. We need more games!

Based on the amount of feedback given to Needa's recent post, I have decided to DM an online Pathfinder game via roll20.net and Skype. We will be starting at level 1, with a party of 4 players. 

Both new and experienced players are welcome. All I ask for is a bit of maturity and that you contribute to the group without taking away the fun from other players.

As a DM, I tend to focus on role-play aspects of the game as opposed to a combat focus. With that said, I also tend to treat the core book as a guide rather than an absolute law. House rules will be abundant, so speak up if you want something done differently.

We will play either Thursday or Saturday evenings beginning around 5:00pm (PST); the day and start/end times are up for discussion during our first meeting. We will be using a custom, free-world style campaign and a low-magic, semi-realistic fantasy setting. 

Prior to our first session, we will gather via Skype to meet each other, discuss character ideas, answer questions about the game, etc. During this time, depending on the longevity of our other conversations, we may also go through the building of your characters and backstory.

Please reply here or message me if you would like to play. Please include your availability on Thursday and/or Saturday, your timezone, prior experience, and pm me your name and skype. You can also add me on skype (muirgm).

I look forward to meeting you all!

Yes, that's a bit in advance, but I have a reason for it: I'm currently running a 4th Edition, Newbie friendly campaign (where everyone was recruited from this subreddit; success stories ftw) and we're over half way through the heroic tier. The purpose of the campaign I am proposing here is to be a parallel adventure to my current one. I will be having an in-game time jump after their heroic tier, so I am looking to start the 2nd campaign concurrently with their paragon tier.

The setting is a homebrew, Post-Apocalypse fantasy where it has been roughly a century since the world went to hell. There are no kingdoms and the scattered towns that are still around are pretty much just advanced groups of survivors. The setting's gods are rumored to be dead or completely missing from daily life. Civilization is set to make a comeback in the next few years, but events that are transpiring in the current group's campaign may take the doomsday clock all the way back to 0.

You see, the group I'm running started as a fairly ""good guys"" group, with one guy who was evil and everyone else being either good or chaotic good. Somehow the events have turned the Evil guy into a neutral and the rest are all heavily chaotic, with the group's paladin of Kord on the verge of going Chaotic Evil. 

The idea for a second campaign came up when they were discussing their alignment shift (they are constantly surprised at how harsh their characters react to NPC's they don't know); a few of us started joking about a sister campaign where it was a group of good guys hunting down their group to show them what they've done.

This isn't exactly what I'm looking for, but a sister campaign where events from one shape events from the other is something I am very interested in. My current group has asked me to not tell them if I'm able to get this proposed group off the ground, as to surprise them when shit hits the fan.

So here's what I'm looking for: a 4-6 players and a ""side-kick"" DM to pick up on my slack. I'm not the most advanced DM, so my homebrew rules tend to be aimed at making things easier on everyone, but timing may be an issue for me, hence wanting someone who I can lean on or have run one of the games if I can't make it. Our current campaign runs from 1pm - 6pm EST every Sunday; what I'm looking for is a group that would be able to meet either Monday or Thursday, around 7pm - 11pm EST. I'm somewhat flexible about this, but I would prefer one of those.

This post is mostly to see who's interested, as it is 2 months until the proposed start. I really like to collaborate, so players and an another DM who would be able to keep the creative process going would be appreciated. I'm always newbie friendly, but since this will be starting in the Paragon Tier (level 11), you might want to at least have a basic understanding of how the game is run (maybe played a few games).

I'm excited to hear from you guys.",,False,,t5_2rcvr,False,,,True,t3_14km71,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/14km71/online_lfm_4th_edition_starting_in_the_paragon/,

So, I'm looking for an online group. Day is undecided, though likely not Thursdays or Saturdays, probably going to run through Skype, AIM, or some other variety of chat-thing (the game has no tactical elements, so a tabletop is unnecessary).
Players would be pilots, or an operations director, should you desire to do so. The world is part Eva, some Deus Ex, and a lot of Roadside Picnic/STALKER.  
For those of you unfamiliar with Neon Genesis Evangelion, and don't want to watch the whole show or don't want to use Google, just imagine that this game is a post-apoc setting 20 minutes into the future with giant biomechanical robots piloted by teenagers.

White wall is the Jewel of the North, it's gleaming brilliant first age architecture dazzling bright against the noonday sun, but all is not right in the once holy city.

The dead, waiting on the other side of the road, subtly try to subvert the roads path, so that no one may reach white walls nearly impenetrable aegis.

a plan has been hatched, and fae and the dead, are conjuring an alliance that may threaten the whole of the north.

Starting a new homebrew campaign and looking for 3-4 dedicated players, alerady have one friend that's in the group. I'm wanting this campaign to last several months, and I will run it as long as I have players. Game time is 1930 CST (tentative) on Fridays, starting next friday the 20th of July. We will use Skype for VoIP, and either Rolld20 or Maptools for gameplay.

I enjoy good roleplaying, as much as I do combat, and joking around. I do however reward good roleplaying, whether it's in conversation or in skill challenges. I plan on doing some pretty fun things mixing combat/skill challenges, trying to speed up combat. One thing I am trying to keep the group away from is 2 hour long combat encounters. Nothing like one of those to kill the attention span of the party and make everyone lose interest in the session. 

Start at level 7, magic items are 6, 7, 8, and 3000 gold. Can downgrade magic items for a lower level. One free Expertise feat. 
When making your character think of a guild that your character is employed by and your role in that guild, i.e. Fighters, Wizardry, Dark Templars, what have you.  I will fit that guild into the story.

If you are interested, go ahead and post in here. Also send a PM if you would like more details.",,False,,t5_2rcvr,False,,,True,t3_whkhf,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/whkhf/online_dm_looking_for_players_4e/,

I've been playing the various editions of D&amp;D for around 11 years, so I'm pretty familiar with the rules.  There are some things that catch me out mechanics-wise (cover vs. concealment for example), but I would say I'm most comfortable/knowledgeable with 3.5 or 4e, so I would prefer to play one of those.

I'm also familiar with d20 Star Wars.  I've played the Original, Revised, and Saga editions on and off for about the same time I've been playing D&amp;D.  I would say I'm most familiar with the Revised and Saga editions.

As for Pathfinder, I've never actually tried the system, but have heard it's somewhat similar to the rules of D&amp;D.  I'm in the process of acquiring the core rulebook so I can learn more.  :D

I'm willing to jump into an already-running group, or be part of a new group just forming together... whatever is good!  I have Skype and am signed up for the Roll20 beta, but will download whatever is necessary for the campaign.  Oh, and the only day I can't play is Mondays.  And I'm GMT-4 (East Coast, USA) if that helps!

I'm a green GM, looking for a group of patient and imaginative players to have some fun with in the Dresden Files universe. Our game is run with a variant of the FATE System, so, fudge dice and lots of character-based roleplaying. I'm running it mostly asynchronously (to cater to folks' busy schedules), but I'd love to try Skyping or Roll20 or Maptools as well.

Dresden Files encourages using real life locations to help build people's familiarity and bond with the city, I'd love to give it a whirl. The plan (based on my and my players' preferences) seems to be something like 30% combat, 70% rping, but that will most likely fluctuate as we get going.

* Here's a wiki I've been compiling of basic info for the Dresden Files game and my previous attempt at campaign, so you can check out how my GM style goes: http://dresdengatorbait.blogspot.com/. 
* And our previous gaming forum (I'm interested in potentially keeping this format, but I'm very open). http://s11.zetaboards.com/gatorbait/index/

So for now, take a look at the board. I have info to share if anyone's unfamiliar with the Dresden Files book series by Jim Butcher, the FATE Rpg system, or the Dresden RPG variant we're playing with.

PLEASE PM me or comment here, and don't register for the board just yet. I like to get to know folks before they make a username on our board.

Ideally I'd like to form a group of players; new or experienced and keep DMing, but if there isn't much interest in that I have no issues joining any games or groups already formed as a player. 

If anyone is interested in playing with me as DM, I get really involved with fleshing out NPCs, making maps, story telling, and using all kinds of art assets, etc if you are into that kind of thing. I like to make up whole worlds and pantheons from scratch and adapt them to whatever rule set rather then place things strictly in Faerun or whichever setting, because it makes it easier to adapt the story to what the players are doing without worrying about stuff like 'No no Palor doesn't work that way.' or 'Neverwinter is no where near Waterdeep.' Even if most of that lore never gets used, like nations and things that are never visited or brought into the story.

I'm just as passionate about being a player too, because then I get a highly localized level of control on my own backstory and motivation and things, rather the needing to worry about making a whole world fit together. 

Anyways, if anyone is interested, drop me a PM or post. I've never posted to LFG or played online with anyone besides with my own local friends, so any tips or advice is welcome.

* [Skype](http://www.skype.com/intl/en-us/get-skype/on-your-computer/windows/)

It would also be nice if everyone had their own Players Handbook and access to a Character Builder, but that's not entirely necessary.

Here's some basic rules that I'll be enforcing, not that I even need to bring them up as they're pretty standard:

* No evil characters (too much to deal with for a 1shot)
* No whining! (it's so obvious, yet so often ignored)
* You must have a Microphone!  (if you don't have one, take a half hour and spend $20.00 at Target or Best Buy to by some PoS mic, it's necessary)
* Come prepared to have a good time (this is of course the most important of them all)

Character stat generation: rolling 4d6 drop lowest, but a new idea i've had for a little bit. Abnormal races are encouraged. I'll tell everyone once we get going. In addition, each character will have some kind of bonus feature outside of what is normally created.

Party so far: gnome bard, human barbarian/rogue, sylph rogue, human fighter/paladin, half-orc cleric (channels negative, undead lord), human-ish psion.

I'm in the process of starting a New World of Darkness (specifically Vampire: the Requiem) game, probably text-based through Skype or the like.

I already have one player, and we're looking for a few more people. The tone and themes of the game are undecided as of right now, as I like to speak about that with my players first, but it being a Vampire game you can expect a lot of backstabbing, political power games, and moral ambiguity. Not to mention a good heaping dose of drama, tense action, and horror on a personal level.

I'll probably come up with a few house rules, but I haven't too hard about that yet. I might include a few of the Merits and Flaws from Old World of Darkness, as well as alter current ones, but I still need to consider it.

Anyways, if you'd be interested in the game, whether you're a seasoned pro or a complete WoD newbie, feel free to reply to this post or PM me. In fact, I encourage you to apply if you're a newbie! We'd love to have you.

**EDIT**: Forgot to mention -- scheduling!

We have not figured out a schedule yet, but it will most likely be on a weeknight and on a weekly basis (or bi-weekly if need be). It may fluctuate depending on my work schedule, but we'll try and figure out something consistent. And, again, I can't wait to make your acquaintance and game with you.

**UPDATE**: Wow. A lot of responses, and fast!

Thank all of you who've asked to join. I received quite a few replies in my inbox not long after I posted this, so sadly the game is full (as of now). But if there are any openings in the group, if anything changes, if I run a second game soon or run one in the future -- I'll either contact you or submit another post to this subreddit!

*Chaos is a ladder.*

*Many who try to climb it fail, and never get to try again. The fall breaks them.*

*Illusions. Only the Ladder is real.*

*The Climb is all there is.*""

           - Petyr Baelish, Game of Thrones (series)


I am excited to introduce **Southron Ambitions**, a play-by-post *A Song of Ice and Fire* chronicle set in the Riverlands at the cusp of the War of the Usurper. Following the path and fate of seven noble houses sworn to the fealty and ambitions of greater houses, they will find themselves at the center of the conflict to come.


The premise of the game we want to run explores from this perspective. The consequences of great romances, heroic overtures, and complex intrigues come down to the houses that must live on this battlefield of the Seven Kingdoms. It is up to the players to decide whether they will take the helm of fate for their own, or be a casualty of it. If you are new to role-playing, play-by-post, or the *A Song of Ice and Fire* setting, or system, you are more than welcome to invite yourself in and take part regardless.


The setting we have built uses an equal part based on the Chronicle Starter and custom work by the GM.


*So how does this work?*


The ""chronicle"" will be organized into individual ""stories"", limited-run setting pieces and adventures in which people will take their characters, while the setting itself remains persistent. These stories will take place over perhaps 1-2 RL months at a time, depending on their scope, and in between some downtime is given for further story and development, through events, decisions, and scenes done independently of those stories as the Houses march through the wheel of fate.


A story will contain the bulk of the role-playing, and will be divided into ""Days"", which are further divided into time slots. These Days will progress over time, keeping the game moving at a decent pace while also providing for people of different schedules and time zones to interact. The current story is ""Summer 281 AL: A Tourney at Harrenhal"", our first story and opening game for the ***Southron Ambitions*** chronicle. If it's a success, we plan on it extending much further, so long as the interest remains.


#*So how do you join?*


You can create any number of accounts you like, though we prefer you only make accounts under your character(s)'s name. Only accounts tied to characters sanctioned for play can post in the in-character forums and the private forums for each faction.


Joining though is quite simple. Once you feel comfortable with the setting and rules, you can get to [Creating Your Character](http://southronambitions.com/viewtopic.php?f=67&amp;t=11) and submitting it via e-mail. At any time you can contact Stranger, the head Narrator, via the e-mail juvenalian.satyr@gmail.com. Alternatively, if you'd like to take a concept already baked into the setting and perhaps are not entirely comfortable with the character creation yet, you can pick one of the [Pre-Generated Characters](http://southronambitions.com/viewforum.php?f=89)


Once your sheet has cleared, the account under your character's name will be added to the appropriate usergroups. Eventually, you may change characters in between stories, or perhaps even have your character die or otherwise removed from play. You can have multiple characters accepted, and multiple accounts to your e-mail address.

As you may have gathered, the emphasis is slightly more on roleplay and flavor than rulebookthumping - if you can explain the rationale behind something semi-sensibly, you can pretty much do it.

55 Years after the Battle of Yavin (Story Arc 8 - Begins April 27th)

It is a dark period for the galaxy. The Dark Empire has crushed all opposition to their rule using the menacing battle station Death Star III, sweeping aside those valiant heroes who have dared oppose them. 

OPERATION: PEACEMAKER under the command of Darth Geminus was successful in routing out and destroying nearly seventy-five percent of the Rebel Alliance, leaving precious few to oppose the Empire and the 'Pax Imperialis' they had imposed upon the galaxy.

A terrifying new threat lurks just beneath the surface, a machine intelligence known as the Central Overmind has begun to take control of droids across the galaxy, intending to use these enslaved machines to enact a brutal war of terror against all sentient life. 

Little does the Empire know, that in systematically destroying the Rebel Alliance they have left the galaxy vulnerable to the greatest terror ever faced.

Life would never be the same.

I have a bit of experience playing 3.5 and 4E both offline and online and very minimal experience as a DM with a few friends years ago.

Looking to possibly try my hand as a DM and I'm possibly looking for players to play through a couple of one shots to get a feel and see how I like it.

I'm ideally looking for people that at least know the rules, as being new as a DM I'll already have quite a lot to work through! However if there are players that have really been itching to play I'll also take that in to consideration.

This will likely be 4E as it's what I am currently playing. However I have also really been wanting to give Pathfinder and D&amp;D Next a go so I may run a few one shots with multiple rulesets, though I'm getting ahead of myself slightly!

These will likely be official modules to keep things simple though as of yet undecided.

Time wise these will likely be run for 3-4 hours on either a Saturday or Sunday day, however I haven't ruled out weekday games either. In terms of software I have experience with both MapTool and Roll20 so I'm a little flexible here. 

Is there any interest for an aspiring DM? I have noticed there seems to be a fair few more players than DM's looking for games. I wanted to try my hand at one shots before considering a more ambitious undertaking.

If all goes well I'll think about making this a semi-regular thing. Perhaps this will give some of the new players out there a chance to have a game! :)

I look forward to hearing from you all!

Edit: Just an update to everyone. I am wanting to run the first of these one shots in the next 2-3 weeks. I will likely use 4E using the [Dungeon Delve](http://www.wizards.com/DnD/Product.aspx?x=dnd/products/dndacc/9780786951390) supplement to keep it nice and simple. I am not against running 2 games if I have a mix of players wanting to play weeknights or weekends. If this goes well I may look at other rulesets as I get more comfortable as a DM (Deadlands Classic or Pathfinder anyone?)

BE AWARE that I am new as a DM so players may have to bear with me while I get my head around everything. I am also happy to create or help assist with basic characters for those newish to the game. Another note is that I am mainly after players who work well together, these sessions will likely be mostly combat/dungeon focused and for these games I am more interested players who will work together opposed to lone wolves/brooding characters. This is perhaps a great opportunity for someone that knows the basic rules but doesn't have a lot of practical experience playing.

The group has a Staff of Healing, which casts Cure Light Wounds once per day per party member, so the Cleric would not need to be a healer, but needed for more of the divination, protection and buffing spells.  

All information from all the relevant rule books will be provided.  Rolling method is 4d6 drop lowest and arrange to taste.  Psionics are in the game, by the book from the PHB, and we're using Unearthed Arcana.

I'm a bit of a system junkie.  My favorite system is Savage Worlds, but I also like FATE (Dresden Files RPG, Starblazer Adventures, Legends of Anglerre), and there are lots of other systems I'd like to try.

My ideal group is one where GM'ing duties rotate, with at least a couple of GMs run anything from a one-shot to a mini-campaign using a system that interests them and supports the sort of game they want to run.  I had a group like this when I lived in the Memphis area and it was a blast... I got a chance to play high fantasy (DnD like), sci-fi, Lovecraftian horror, espionage, etc. and the different GM's kept things interesting and varied.  (And of course I am willing to be one of the GM's, and even the primary one if necessary.)

With this said, I also like DnD, with my favorite version being the Mentzer BECMI/Rules Cyclopedia.  I've played both Pathfinder and 4e, and like them both for different reasons, and would play both again.  But preferably I'd be part of a group that wants to sample the larger world of game systems and not solely play d20 based games.

(I am aware and am a member of the Nashville DnD meetup group.  It's a fine group that I've participated in.  But I am currently looking to play in a private venue, and prefer not to play ""organized"" games (Encounters, LFR) as I find them to be more restrictive.)

We really just all want to play I guess.  Personally, I want to play because I've always GMing for every group I've ever been in and I haven't had a chance to play more than two continuous sessions.  As such, we have *everything* you would ever need to DM:

* Rulebook and advanced rulebook, beastiary 1-3, Inner Sea Guide, GM book
* Three adventure path beginnings and the willingness to buy all six if it gets rolling
* Pathfinder screen, beastiary miniature box, extra minis (some hero quest some others), dry erase mat, condition cards, buff cards etc etc

In other words, we have everything you need to run a game.  I hate to ask someone else to run a game for everyone else, but I want to play for once.

I, (signature), agree (with no legal effect) to make an effort to both communicate to you my roleplaying goals and to physically be present at an online game, for greater than 3 hours. I understand that the Dungeon Master of this game will be devoting time beyond the game for the group's sake, and that he/she will also be making a commitment to the schedule. 

I, (signature), understand that I am expected to develop a character sheet and understand that assistance with character development is not far away. I should not shy away from backstories or narrative hubris. I will deliver these items to the DM of the game; 

Character sheet, mostly any format (if given time)

 +1 of your character's ;desires

 +1 of your character's ;fears 

+1 of your character's ;enemies (this will become a real-game NPC) 

+1 of your character's ;allies (again, real-game NPC)

 +1 of your character's ;prized possesions

 +1 of your character's ;greatest loss

 +1 of your character's ;most intimate relationships (needn't be real/animate, eg a dwarf's most intimate relationship is with his flagon) 

+1 of your character's ;most known-about place (eg. their home, workplace, etc)

 +1 of your character's ;prejudices (real-life racism is not okay but in-game racism is roleplaying and therefore moot) 

+1 of your character's ;battle tendencies (we must all accept this tendency; even me, so think in the area of; my character hates beetles so much that he cannot move when they are near. ; guess what? beetle attack!) 

+1 of your character's ;peace-time tendencies

 +1 of your character's ;most hated/most favoured alignment. 

With this information my Dungeon Master will be able to fashion an enjoyable game. I agree to encourage the development of the story by contributing whatever digital skills or resources are available, and by specifically focusing on role-playing and realism and game-immersion. 

With this in mind, I finally and wholly agree to have fun and be honest and kind. I remember that rules are meant to be broken.

Post this in this feed or PM me with such and I will give you the game details. Once we get a party going it'll be one day or so for me to build the campaign then away we go! We have two players already

Ruined by decades of war and global crises, the city is now home to those that can't or won't fit in elsewhere. The city is little more than an anarchy, plagued by every imaginable evil and horror, from self-reproducing serial killers to pusher gangs who hold down people and force them to use drugs.*

*Yet in the darkness of the city, a flame of hope smolders and grows. Homeless families are turning the wisdom from generations on the streets in to power. Good people are starting gangs for self defense, turning gang membership in to something to be proud of. Young people are using the same illegal technology that turns some people in to monsters to turn themselves in to powerful heroes.*

*People in the city have finally realized that nobody else is going to save them, and they are learning to save themselves.*

Fates Worse Than Death is a hard science-fiction cyber punk set in Manhattan in the year 2080. The best that humanity has to offer now live in gated communities that can, and do, use brain-scanning technology to test for loyalty, honesty, and intelligence, insuring that their communities are the healthiest in history. Those who continue to live in inner-city slums (which is what Manhattan has become) are those too poor, too rebellious, too unstable, too stupid, or too corrupt to get accepted into a gated community, and must learn to survive on the streets.

I'd like to start a play-by-forum game of Fates Worse Than Death. [The games website](http://www.fatesworsethandeath.com/!FWTD/) contains more setting info, as well as links to freely download the Spare Change Edition ruleset, which contains gameplay and character creation info for the Street People classes (the classes are divided between three economic levels, Street People being the lowest.) If cyborg gang fighters, aggressive drug pushers, sleepless homeless psychics, packs of feral and mindless addicts, and self-replicating serial killers sound like fun threats to fight, please join in the fun with me!

Its a d20 system that's currently free, quick to learn, and rather streamlined in my opinion. I've got a few friends interested in playing over [Maptools](http://rptools.net/) on Fridays or Sundays.

If you don't know how to use maptools or bypass routers to host a game, I'm more than willing to sit down and help. Maptools is a Virtual Table top that allows players and DM's to do a live encounter around a chat service, dice roller, and image board for maps and all sorts of visual stimulation.

I've been playing in a few games with friends I have here, however, it appears that they can only meet to game once a month or so.  I am unsatisfied with this so I am starting a new group and I'm looking for players.  Here are the details:

**The Game System:** Pathfinder or 4E (whichever is preferred by the group)

**The Time:** 7PM until Midnight

**The Schedule:** The first and third Saturday of every month.

**Game Style:** High Fantasy in a Home-brew world.

**The Location:** Santa Clara, CA

**The GM (me):** I have over a decade of experience as a GM.  I know how to listen to my players and provide a captivating, twisting story while avoiding railroading.  I'm fairly decent at off-the-cuff plot changes and I'm not afraid to play NPC's with distinct personalities and mannerisms.  I favor roleplaying over combat, but the group will see combat on a fairly regular basis.

**The players I want:** Light-hearted and sociable people who know when it's appropriate to joke and when its time to take the role seriously.  They also must be able to attend the game regularly (obviously the occasional absence is understandable).  If all you care about is min-maxed characters and combat please don't bother, that's not my style of gaming.  You must be able to provide your own transportation to the game and for reasons I can explain in person it must be held at my house.

**I will provide:** Snacks, usually though not always.  Contributions are welcome.

**The Campaign:** ""Orb Jumper""  Inspired by SciFi shows such as ""Sliders"" and the movie ""Inception"", my Orb Jumper campaign takes place in a world where magic is commonplace and nobles spend fortunes having custom-built orbs that can contain anything from a small room to a small planet with customized rules of physics and magic.  Orb crafting is a rare but valued art, and with it comes that elite of all adventurers -- Orb Jumpers.  You see, sometimes the villain will abscond with his loot or his kidnapped princess into one of these Orbs and brave souls are needed to bring the villain to justice and also retrieve that loot (or princess).  But what kind of person voluntarily jumps into another reality fully knowing that it could consist entirely of molten lava or a planet entirely populated by clowns?  Only the best, the desperate or the crazy (often all three!).  For some, Orb Jumping is all they have known because they were born in an Orb and travelling the artificial realities is second-nature.  For others it is a life of changes and thrills that holds an addictive nature.

If you have the time and the desire to play in my campaign please send me a message.  I will cap the group at 5 players, currently there are 4 slots available.",,False,,t5_2rcvr,False,,,True,t3_llq0p,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/llq0p/looking_for_players_santa_clara_ca_campaign/,

The events and players are very familiar, yet, things have changed.

The galaxy had become an even darker place than during the rise of the Empire. Treacherously, Luke Skywalker fell to the Dark Side and joined his father, earning himself the title of Darth Fatalis. Together, this pair of villains not only destroyed the Rebel Alliance, but ended the reign of Emperor Palpatine as they banded together to kill him. This last fact was hidden from the Imperial troops and the Galaxy at large, until, the Hand of the Emperor, Mara Jade, brought the truth to life.

In a shocking turn of events, the Empire was split into two factions. A new Galactic Civil War emerged, but this time, not as a battle of Good versus Evil, but something more sinister. However, Darth Sidious was prepared for the Skywalkers' treachery. Using Mara Jade's body, the Emperor had resurrected himself, and as he revealed himself once more to the Galaxy, led Jade's forces in a siege on Coruscant. Sparking the new Golden Age of Sith, he used his new Sith warriors to destroy the Skywalker traitors, and he personally revealed himself to the fallen pair of Jedi, before slaughtering them.

With the Empire being once more brought under Palpatine's control, it seemed all hope was lost. Things have a tendency to come full circle; however. New rebellions emerged, led by surviving members of the former Rebel Alliance.

Now, the Rebel Alliance has been reborn, though the Rebels have a great task ahead of them. The Empire is stronger than ever, but there is at last a glimmer of hope.

This is the dark world of Star Wars: Uprising.

* Play as almost any race and character concept your imagination can come up with (within reason), from nearly any race in the Star Wars universe, to pilot almost any ship in Star Wars, and mastery of the enigmatic Force can even be had!

**Preferred time**: Any week night, 6 - 11.  
**Flexibility**: Just nothing before 6 or so on weekdays, currently occupied Fridays / Saturdays.  
**Frequency**: No more than once a week.  
**More Details**: I'm looking to DM a group online one night a week. I'm going to be in EST and games will likely be on Thursday evenings (this is subject to change based on player availability).   

**Game Info**  

* Players will start at lvl1
* Flaking twice will result in you dropping
* Currently looking for 3-5 players
* Will be using Skype + MapTool
* Custom world, same pantheon
* Alignments: LG, NG, CG, LN, N
* Length: 8-9 months, maybe longer
* Starts: Late August / Early September

Also, before start, I want to 1-on-1 with each player to get a feel for their style. I tend to be more on the role-playing side with less kick-in-the-door combat. 

The world itself will be high magic. Anything that is Pazio-published (*not 3rd party*) on the d20pfsrd is valid (unless it's weird and I say otherwise - ask if you aren't sure).

The campaign will be rather free-form with large problems you need to deal with but without absolutely clear ways to deal with them. For example, a group of werewolves may be attacking a town and you need to help. You can either follow up on the rumor of powerful druids in the outlying forests, or seek a legendary sword in nearby mountains, or even head to neighboring towns to get more soldiers for your cause. (We won't be fighting werewolves most likely - this is just an example).

You try, you win or run, and you can't really min-max to the level RPGs have been accustomed to and it really is an unpredictable adventure. 

To give an example of imbalanced and unpredictableness of Planescape while looking through the planescape monstrous compendium I, I found Succubus with a 1d3 attack and a level drain ability if she kisses you after failing wisdom check and 6 HD and wondering why she was worth 11,000 experience and saw her ability to Gate in a Balor 40% 1/day.
There's no way to classify that kind of exeprience in modern RPGs of the pimp from hell that can slaughter the party appearing if you piss off the succubus and the roll goes against you.

The actual setting is what really drags me in, there hasn't been that kind of strange fantasy anymore. 4th edition tried to use the feywild but it was still so strongly base-dnd that it was like an invasion of strangeness in theory but just more token monsters in a set setting, and 3.5/pathfinders are creating that lovable but generic RPG with new adventure twists or just more custimization to replace that desire to play something new. 
The most recent game that goes with the Planescape setting mood is really Machinarium, that strange indie robot game, and if you've played both you know that weirdness is the same appeal of them.

If you want to play let let me know, I've ranted long enough, I'm going to start off with the Level 1 module The Eternal Boundary to get people familiar with the setting and rules if they are new/rusty to ADnD 2nd Edition.",,False,,t5_2rcvr,False,,,True,t3_1knjpa,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1knjpa/online_planescape_add_2nd_edition_starting_with/,

I might have after school activities and homework, so weekdays are if-ish for me.

I don't need to stay for the entire session, though. I might just pop in and out at times. I have a Skype, but not a microphone or a webcam. Sorry about that.

You've got two games running on alternating weeks to satisfy a wide range of gaming needs. Games are at the Game Den in Warren, RI on Saturday at 5pm. 

First is Rippers. Play as part of a team of monster hunters in Victorian London. Hunt down werewolves, stake vampires, banish demons, and more. Play with all the latest weapons and gadgets, call upon heavenly and eldritch forces, and search through tomes of dark knowledge. When all of that isn't enough to keep the forces of the monster-loving Cabal at bay, you can rip out parts of the monsters you kill and graft them into yourself, at the cost of your sanity. Span the globe and fight monsters to keep the world from plunging into darkness.

Second we have Necessary Evil. Aliens have invaded Earth and after a drawn-out war and a betrayal that would make the Lannisters proud, nearly every superhero is dead. Aliens have occupied Earth for two years now and metahumans are forbidden from using their abilities. With the death of nearly every caped crusader, there is only one group left who can save Earth from the V'sori: super villains! Play the worst humanity has to offer to save humanity as we know it. If someone is going to rule Earth, shouldn't it be you?

Savage Worlds is a lightweight generic system that can be used for any kind of adventure. It's easy to learn and easy to play. It prides itself on being Fast, Fun, and Furious and lives up to that promise.

If you want to join, all you have to do is be eager to play (no experience with RPGs necessary,) willing to learn, and able to play nice with others (it's a team game after all). Contact me (Andrew) here or speak to Nate at the Game Den or on Facebook.

The Game Den is located on 16 Cutler Street, Warren, RI. Call them at (401) 237-0336 or check out their Facebook.

We're starting this Saturday (August 24th) with Necessary Evil, and we have three slots still open. You can join Rippers, Necessary Evil or both! The rules are mostly the same for both games.

Hope to see you Saturday!",,False,,t5_2rcvr,False,,,True,t3_1kkn5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/comments/1kkn5p/offline_warren_ri_savage_worlds_rippersnecessary/,

I've played play-by-post for several years at the same site, which hosts currently Star Wars Saga, Pathfinder, WH40k, L5R, Mechwarrior, Hunter: The Vigil, and other games. We've also had some Shadowrun, DnD, Mutants &amp; Masterminds, and many other system/settings.

Our current Star Wars Saga game is coming to a close within a few months and we'll be starting a new Star Wars Edge of the Empire game. A few of the players and the GM will be returning, but we're looking for a couple more players interested in learning the new Star Wars system.

There's lots of other games on the site as well, so you could join multiple games and help get started on the EotE campaign. 

Site at http://brennor.dyndns.org/rpg/Forums.html

If interested, just create a forum account and send a PM to the GM. The master games list is filed under Game Openings, so you can check there for available openings and send that game's GM a PM and ask.

The site is most active during the week and is sparse on weekends, since most people post during work or school :)
