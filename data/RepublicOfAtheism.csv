Not sure why because I am certain the dichotomy of Rationalism and Empiricism is intrinsic to what makes us atheists and not simply those who oppose certain religions on principle. At our core we deny that experiential reality can be described by anything other than our senses - no innate knowledge allowed. 

General gist goes like this:

I have seen various otherwise well informed and intentioned atheist commentators here and elsewhere refer to themselves as ""rationalists"" or following a ""rationalist"" perspective. This is not technically accurate as a rationalist philosophy predicates the acceptance of innate knowledge and inspiration; as in the innate existence of God. Empiricism on the other hand holds that all matters of fact must be decided by sensory perception, and anything else is a relation of ideas, not knowledge itself. 

The SEP explains the philosophical divide much better than I can so please have a look : http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rationalism-empiricism/

However, I recently took a brief hiatus from this network due to the [birth of my daughter](http://www.flickr.com/photos/syncretic/6244994775/in/photostream/lightbox/) and other personal issues. To make a long story short, my wife and I have to pack all of our belongings and move into a new apartment before December 1st all the while taking care of a month-old infant. Things have somewhat settled down now, and I have a little more time to devote to reddit again, but I have noticed that a lot of the submissions in the last few weeks do not directly discuss atheism. My first instinct was to start removing all of these submissions, but then I thought, if our active members who are submitting content don't agree with the current relevancy rule, perhaps we should discuss the issue.

I'd like to hear your opinions on this matter, /r/RoAtheism. Should we allow anything even tangentially related to atheism (like criticism of theology in general) or should we stick to articles, videos and discussion that is directly related to atheism and mentions it explicitly?

Quotes:

""Whether you are religious or not, you feel obliged to use language that has been shaped by religion in order to express things that may not have a religious purpose. So that’s a constant battle.""

""I would argue, not unconventionally, that religion comes after reason and that, actually, religious texts were invented by people and that gods, indeed, were invented by human beings in order to answer the two great questions of life, “Where do we come from?” and “How should we live?”  It seems as if every religion is based on an attempt to answer those questions, the question of origin and the question of ethics.I would say, and I have often said, that I don’t need religion to answer either of those questions...But when I’m writing, something weird happens, and the result is these books which clearly do contain a large amount of what you would call supernaturalism.  I find that as a writer I need that in order to explain the world I am writing about.  As a person I don’t need it, but as a writer I do.  So that tension is just there.  I can’t reconcile it, it is just so.""

""many people my age who have any knowledge not just of India but of other parts of the Muslim world can remember, another idea of Islam, one that had more or less nothing to do with what walks around the world calling itself Islam nowadays, one in which it was O.K. to argue about things and to talk freely and to live at peace with other people and so on.  It wasn’t perfect because none of us are perfect, but it was possible.""

""there may be many things for which one can blame the United States, but the self-destruction of Muslim culture by other Muslims is a self inflicted wound, and it is a grievous wound.  In that novel I tried to write about that other, to my mind, more beautiful approach to the world.  You’re right that the answer to religion is not no religion, but another way of thinking about religion, another way of being in the religion.""

"" One of the characters in The Enchantress of Florence is asked by Akbar, just before he has his head chopped off, what his idea of paradise is, since he is on his way there.  He says that in paradise the words “religion” and “argument” mean the same thing and that there is no suppression in religion.""",,False,,t5_2stkz,False,,,True,t3_m5x2n,http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfAtheism/comments/m5x2n/fascinating_talk_by_salman_rushdie_on_secularism/,

[Course introduction](http://youtu.be/p2J7wSuFRl8). Professor Kagan introduces the course and the material that will be covered during the semester. Skip to chapter two of this video to hear how he lays out what he is going to teach.

* Part one: [The nature of persons: dualism vs. physicalism](http://youtu.be/gh-6HyTRNNY). Professor Kagan discusses the two main positions with regard to the question, ""What is a person?"" On the one hand, there is the dualist view, according to which a person is a body and a soul. On the other hand, the physicalist view argues that a person is just a body. The body, however, has a certain set of abilities and is capable of a large range of activities.

* Part two: [Arguments for the existence of the soul, Part I](http://youtu.be/GR63MMAi-fs). The lecture focuses on arguments that might be offered as proof for the existence of the soul. The first series of arguments discussed is those known as ""inferences to the best explanation."" That is, we posit the existence of things we cannot see so as to explain something else that is generally agreed to take place.

* Part three: [Introduction to Plato's Phaedo; Arguments for the existence of the soul, Part II](http://youtu.be/AGXYeV2v5fU). After a brief introduction to Plato's Phaedo, more arguments are offered in this lecture in defense of the existence of an immaterial soul. The emphasis here is on the fact that we need to believe in the existence of a soul in order to explain the claim that we possess free will. This is an argument dualists use as an objection to the physicalists: since no merely physical entity could have free will, there must be more to us than just being a physical object.

* Part four: [Arguments for the existence of the soul, Part III: Free will and near-death experiences](http://youtu.be/CWVlorPM3rA). Professor Kagan discusses in detail the argument of free will as proof for the existence of an immaterial soul. The argument consists of three premises: 1) We have free will. 2) Nothing subject to determinism has free will. 3) All purely physical systems are subject to determinism. The conclusion drawn from this is that humans are not a purely physical system; but Professor Kagan explains why this argument is not truly compelling. In addition, near-death experiences and the Cartesian argument are discussed at length.",,False,,t5_2stkz,False,,,True,t3_kvam0,http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfAtheism/comments/kvam0/the_philosophy_of_death_by_professor_shelly_kagan/,

&gt;For articles and discussions about secular atheism, as well as criticisms of religion. A submission qualifies as a criticism if it (1) specifies a topic, (2) arrives at a specific value judgment, and (3) presents at least one argument connecting the topic to the judgment.

The subreddit-specific rules would be updated as well:

&gt; Submissions will be removed by the moderators if:   
&gt; 1. ... the relevance to the atheist community is not made explicit in either the submission title or the linked-to media (*relevance* rule), *or*;  
&gt; 2. ... they claim relevance as a criticism of religion, but fail to specify either a topic, a value judgment, or at least one argument connecting the two (*criticism* rule).

If you are an approved submitter here, please leave a comment with your vote like so:

    [](/yes)
    [](/no)
    [](/abstain)

Your votes will show up like this:

[](/yes)  

[](/no)  

[](/abstain)   

This vote will be open for at least 5 days or until at least 5% of the approved submitters have voted, whichever comes last.

**Edit 17-Jan-2012:** I'm closing this thread since we *just barely* have the votes needed to do so.

So, you may ask, why did it take so long? Let me break it down for you; I'm using the old rules that were in place when the vote started. We currently have 227 approved submitters. 5% of that is 11.35, rounded up to 12. Since we need at least 5% of the approved submitters to vote in order to close the thread, that means we needed at least 12 votes here. 24 people voted in total. Easily more than we need, right? Wrong.

One person apparently deleted their account. One person tried to vote twice with two different accounts (skifrk29 and HandicapperGeneral are [the same person](http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfReddit/comments/n2645/to_all_of_my_loyal_fans/)). Eight people voted but were never added to the approved submitters list, and I'm not going to add them unless they request it.

Come check us out if you're on your own road from religion :),OuRR_World,4,4,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/RepublicOfAtheism/comments/yv66s/just_wanted_to_extend_a_friendly_invite_to/,"Hi everyone!

Jerry and I did an awesome AMA a few months ago, and after a ton of requests for there to be a subReddit for RR, we've decided to take the plunge and start one: http://www.reddit.com/r/OuRR_World. It is intended to be a safe place for dialogue and questioning religious beliefs, as well as exploring the impact of religion in your life. Where it differs from similar other ""former religion"" subreddits is that this is an overarching ""recovering"" type concept, as opposed to a more denominational/specific focus. The trends and processes of leaving religion are similar across the board, so while there's no doubt a specific focus is helpful as well in finding a common ground of people leaving a specific religion, it's also tremendously valuable to connect with people all over the spectrum who are going through similar challenges personally, and with family and friends.

We do know it's Reddit and there are entire colonies of delightfully argumentative /r/'s to go play in, so we encourage the focus to stay on discussion, disagreement, and decorum in ours...we know it can be done! Also, take a few minutes to check out our website (www.recoveringfromreligion.org), our Facebook fb/recoveringfromreligion, and our Twitter (@Ourr_World) to find a local group near you, learn more about us, what we do, why we do it, and where we are headed from here. For even more information, we are featured on the New York Times this week, and we have a 4 page article about Jerry and RR in the print version that came out today. Also, we are featured in the current issue of American Atheists magazine.

Thanks for taking the time to read about us, and while we're not new to Reddit, we're new to managing a subreddit, so bear with us as we figure it all out together. Hope to see you over there, and feel free to post here, on /r/OuRR_World or message me if you have questions or need more information, we are always happy to help!

All the best!
