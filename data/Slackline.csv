In order to combat this issue and help out the people that are new to slacklining and looking for contacts, there are a few things we should all do:

* First of all, if you haven't already, you should all add yourselves to the [Balance Community Slackliner Database](https://www.balancecommunity.com/Slackliner-Database). It's super useful and it only takes a few seconds to add yourself to it!

* And second-of-ly, you should all register with [SlackLink](http://slacklink.org/) and add all of your favourite slacklining locations to their [SlackMap](http://slacklink.org/index.php/slackmap). The SlackMap is relatively new, and doesn't have many locations yet, but it has tons of potential to be an incredible resource for slackliners all

Without him I don't think I'd ever have had the bravery to try the thing out on my own. (Now even when I go on my own I'm acting a fool on it) I can't balance for crap but I try to spend some time on it every time I go. I feel like once I have my own I can get competent on it much, much faster.

I finally took the plunge and ordered one yesterday, the gibbon dual ratchet set. It kinda bugged me that there were so many reported issues with it, that it was heavy, that it'd fall apart sooner than it should, etc, but I ordered it anyway. Something about it just didn't sit right with me. After I ordered I was so, so lucky to find /r/slackline and the sidebar guides quickly led me to confidence in building a primitive setup. I canceled my order on Amazon immediately and now I'm waiting on my [standard kit](http://i.imgur.com/co63fWs.png) from REI. At first I was looking at the kit images people posted on here and scratched my head. I couldn't figure out how you could make it work. The ingenious rigging method used, is to me is so satisfying, so much more than the ratchets.

I'm sure these posts come up all the time, but still, I feel like this subreddit saved me at the last moment and set me on the right path to a long term enjoyment of slacklining, so thank you.

As a small gift, I'm converting the slackline tension calculator in the sidebar into a self contained web page/script. Will post an update about that when I'm done.

**Update: I've finished the first version of the slackline load calculator. This is free software, do with it what you will. It's a single file, self contained app, so if you save the page to your computer you can take it with you and run it in a browser on any device and it should work the same. Enjoy. http://slackline.sparkfire.net/**",,False,self,t5_2rbhm,1370549118.0,,,True,t3_1fsn7h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/1fsn7h/such_a_great_little_resource_you_have_here/,

* Holds the World Record for Longest Highline: 451 ft 
* First to send the Master of the Universe line in Czech Republic
* First to send the Cascade Falls line in Yosemite

He's a cool guy too.

OK so I talked to Jerry and he thinks it'll be fun.  Let's do this thing!  He'll stop by at 9:30 PST on Friday Dec. 7th (this Friday) to answer any and all questions.

I know it's been slow going to get all the pieces assembled and posted.  

Here is [the playlist with all five](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcuLH9poakg-t4riFQbDKQSUocX6e996y) segments, or individual videos are:

* Part 1 ([Slings](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heNlBAkwqiY))

* Part 2 ([Webbing Anchors](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7pDtPce9xU))

* Part 3 ([Webbing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmUKDoIpOGY))

* Part 4 ([Tension Systems](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQ0OhGIVqa0))

* Part 5 ([Walking](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8LwaoyZjjg))

Next up on the video project list (as school and weather allow) will be a guide to softpointing (covering 5 different techniques), a video about dynos, and a dozen or so detailed webbing reviews.

Lastly, you may have noticed many of the videos now have banners or other youtube-inserted ads.  I resisted for a long time monetizing the videos because ads can be kind of annoying, but on the other hand people are getting my videos for free, and when some of those people click the links that means an occasional advertising revenue check from google for me — which allows me to buy gear that I can destroy in break tests or otherwise do something cool with on video, so I decided it made sense to enable the ads by default on most of my videos.  People clicking the ads doesn't mean a LOT of revenue (sadly I don't think I get any if they just watch an ad, haha), but it does mean a bit, and that buys some gear, so hopefully y'all don't find the ads too annoying.

I had seen videos online and was always curious about it. I've always loved balancing on things since I was little so I knew if I gave it a go I would like it, but man I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did. 

I was fairly drunk so it took a while to get used to it but I ended up picking it up fairly quick, though I was kind of annoyed that I had a drink as I know I would have done so much better if I was sober. 

I ordered a line straight away from Amazon. I can't wait for it to arrive this week! 

I'm on a bit of a health kick at the minute and I think it's going to be the thing I do that will really change my fitness level as I know I'm gona be wanting to do it all the time.

I'm also going to Thailand next month so It will be an awesome toy to take to the beach!

I'm looking forward to being part of this community here on Reddit. One thing I liked so much about doing it yesterday was just how nice the people were that do it. As soon as I talked about possibly buying one the guys told me all about the community that they're a part of that get together every weekend for slacklining sessions.

The main member is a ten foot 4x6.  I have seven layers of 2x6 in a tiered configuration.  All layers are completely glued and screwed together.  For each layer, I used several 3"" screws with a bit of a shoulder to clamp down on the glue.  The space between the slackline and the top of the main member is about 11"".  All the lumber cost about $23 USD.   Box of screws $5.  Bottle of glue $3.  Easy.

Additional info:
If you aren't lazy like me, you should really drill pilot holes for the ""tiers"" to ensure that the screws are clamping the wood together.  Each piece of wood is not perfectly flat so you need to put several screws down.  Once the wood glue dries, it will provide much more strength than the screws; the tiers become one solid piece which doesn't creak.  On the sides of the tiers, i penciled in hash marks to indicate whether i used one (in the middle) or two screws (one at 1/3 and another at 2/3).  For each layer I alternated the pattern to keep from screwing into a screwhead from the layer below.  Also, I noticed that the 4x6 still flexes slightly when I jump onto the middle of the slackline.  For a 10' span, I find it acceptable.",,False,self,t5_2rbhm,True,,,True,t3_da2ni,http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/da2ni/diy_slackline_frame_in_my_living_room/,

I tried their line and it felt awesome, so I started to help promote their products. A few days ago, I told him that he should start an AMA on /r/slackline so he can reveal more information about his products than just me saying that PTEN webbing is pretty good. 

Since I got him to write up that AMA, I figured I'm kinda obligated to explain what I know. 

He is a very very new redditor, so he is not familiar with rediquette or the rules or anything quite yet. So a couple of days ago, he makes AMA post. I approved it, made the verification post, then stopped following it. Then last night, I get a txt from him asking how to delete that AMA. I checked his account and the front page, and the AMA was already gone. I advised him to not delete the post, but it was too late.

I just got home from work and saw Detailorient's post. After reading most of the comments in the AMA and the MFW posts, here are my thoughts:

1. PTEN is a new start-up. They are barely starting to make a little profit. The company is started by a few college grads, so they don't have much experience in business. and they aimed to help grow the sport, and, ofc, make some profit. 
2. As a start-up, they don't really have any legal experience either. So that's probably why they were really hesitant to answer and ignored some questions about rigging and safety.
3. With no offense to Adam, but I believe his questions were kind of close to PTEN's trade secrets. I think the weave and the material of the slackline is unique to every company, so it's probably not a good idea to publicly release that kind of information. Also, I believe Adam is trying to start a company as well ( I might be wrong), so releasing these information to a possible competitor is probably not a good idea.
4. They aren't very experienced with the fancy rigging that we do. They wanted to focus on ratchets, so anyone can slack. That being said, I don't think they would know anything about rigging with pulleys.

They are still growing, and are in the learning stages, too. For some of the complicated problems, I don't think they know the answer either. Even though they made many mistakes in the AMA, I don't think it's reasonable to call them douches. 

I just wanted to bring in some new content to this subreddit, didn't expect it to erupt into drama. 

And this is gonna come across as me defending PTEN, but I just wanted to say I have no affiliation with them.

Edit: I'm texting Kyle right now, and hopefully, he can come back and give us an explanation. 

Edit 2: I've been talking to ewheat, and he pointed out that I've said that I worked with PTEN before. And since I said I have no affiliation with them, it seems like I'm contradicting myself. This is my clarification: At the beach where I slack, there aren't many trickliners. Me being decent at tricklining, caught PTEN's attention. In hopes of eventually becoming a sponsored athlete and get cool shitz, I start to promote their products and providing my assistance. But I was never technically included in their company. I didn't expect this to happen from a simple AMA. As someone who has founded a couple of start-ups that eventually failed, I know how difficult it is for a new company. As a friend of the founders of PTEN, I just wanted to clarify what I know in attempt to save some reputation...I guess. As for the hating Gibbon thing, I don't hate Gibbon, I just hate the ClassicLine. IMO, it's not worth the money. Since I recently became mod, it's probably a good idea to make everything clear, so I don't get shit later :D",,False,self,t5_2rbhm,1343532224.0,,,True,t3_x9swl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/x9swl/re_pten_ama/,
1340048823.0,15,self.Slackline,v8ltr,r/Slackline FAQ,rSlackline_FAQ,19,4,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/v8ltr/rslackline_faq/,"**What is slacklining:** The art of balancing on a flat piece of webbing anchored between two points.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

**Types of Slackline:**

* **Primitive line:** This kind of set up is usually less than 100ft long and a few ft high. This is the easiest setup, requiring only several carabiners and climb-spec of mil-spec webbing.

* **Longline:** A line that is not very high off the ground, but can be hundreds of feet long.

* **Highline:** A line that is set up very high up from the ground. Usually the slackliner wears a harness and is leashed on the line it self.

* **Trickline:** A line that is extremely elastic under tension. Designed to let the slackliner bounce high for dynamic moves/tricks.

* **Waterline:** A line that is setup over water.

* **Rodeoline:** A line that is hung up on two relative high anchor points, with no tension in the line. The line draps between the two anchor points. Finding the balance point is difficult, because the line can swing out under your feet, throwing you off to one side.

-----------------------------------------
**Primitive line:**

There are a few ways to set up this kind of slackline. The tension is held by friction.

**3-carabiner method:** Instead of using an anchor on the non-tensioned side, you will thread your line through a fixed loop at one end of your line. This method is not recommended due to the negative affect it can have on your line (reduces break strength, more likely to fray your line).


[**4-carabiner method**](http://www.nwslackline.org/96/howto-setting-up-a-basic-primitive-slackline): This is one way to setup the basic ""primitive"" line. This method uses one carabiner on one anchor, and 3 on the tensioning side (two biners are clipped on to the other anchor).

[**Multiplier**](http://www.nwslackline.org/207/strength-of-3-men-for-only-20): This is a way to make pulling out the slack in your slackline easier. It's composed of pulleys, carabiner, and static rope. 

The multiplier can also be achieved using 2 extra carabiners. One biner will be clipped into the tension side anchor ([be sure to clip into the webbing like this]()), the other will be exactly where the pulley is in the video. Feed the lose end to the biner that is clipped to the anchor, then back to the other free biner. [Two biner multiplier will look like this.]()



-------------------------------------------
**Longline:**

Longlines require a pulleys system to tension the line. Tension is held by a brake at the end of the pulley system. 

**Method where the pulley system stays in the rig:**

**Softpointing:** The pulley system can be removed from the rig, leaving the line anchor to anchor. This will require a linegrip.

**Highline:**

**Trickline:**

The only place at my house that would work would be two trees that are 100ft apart. Would this be too difficult for a beginner? 

2. How high would it have to be if I strung the entire distance? 

3. Could I put a box/stand halfway to split up the line into two parts? 

4. I think I've tried a 2in Gibbon SL and did pretty well, would you recommend 1in or 2in line?

5. Would I just have to buy the recommended items on the sidebar (just with like 120ft of line) or since I have a longer line do I need different gear? 

6. Is it ok to use this 100ft line to make something smaller (like 25ft) sometimes? I'm thinking about taking this up to Canada in a couple weeks.

7. Is there any other recommendations or tips you can offer me in this purchase?

To start off, a pulley system is a much more efficient method to rig a slackline. You can use a pulley system to rig almost any line you want. 

-----------------------------------------------------------

[Balance Community](www.balancecommunity.com) has a great [guide on pulley systems](http://www.balancecommunity.com/Slack-Science/all-about-pulley-systems-the-complete-guide). If you are interested, please read through those SlackScience articles.

--------------------------------------------------

I recently built my own pulley system, and through a lot of Googling, I found some sites that sell components for much much much cheaper. And here is where I got all of my stuff:

**3"" SMC PMP double pulleys:** [FeldFire](http://www.feldfire.com/SMC-Prusik-Minding-Pulley_p_712.html) sells those pulleys for about $95, just make sure you select double as your model. If you use the coupon code ""facebook1"", you can get an additional 10% off (not sure if coupon code still works).

**SMC Rigging Plate:** [FeldFire](http://www.feldfire.com/SMC-NFPA-Rigging-Plate_p_683.html) sells them for about $40

**Shackles:** [Trek Adventure Gear](http://trekadventuregear.com/store/) sells 1/2"" Van Beest Green Pin shackles for $7 and ARB 3/4"" shackles for $11

**Brake:** Braking devies like GriGri/Petzl Rig/Petzl I'D are usually available used on Craig's List. You can always search for items at other locations have have them mail it to you. I was able to find a GriGri for 40 bucks, new. Try [AdHuntr](adhuntr.com) to search ALL of Craig's List.

**Static Rope:** I used Craig's List for that as well. Rope you HAVE to get new! Used ropes are NOT reliable because you don't know the history. Your best bet is to find people who are selling whole spools. Then you can keep some for yourself and sell the rest for a little profit.

**Spansets:** Check out [Manufacturer Express](mfrexpress.com).

**Quicklinks, Steelies, and misc. stuff:** Find friends who can get pro-deals. I got mine from CAMP-USA. Quicklinks you can get at most hard ware store or on manufacturer express, just make sure they are rated high enough.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Lastly, there is a facebook group called [SlackChat](https://www.facebook.com/groups/slackchat/), and a group called [SlackChat: Used Gear Listing](https://www.facebook.com/groups/279618212103376/), where you can find some pretty good deals on used slackline rigging components. 



**Edit:** added spansets

**Edit 2:** Unless you have a lot of money ready to throw out, this process takes a good amount of time. I've spent months monitoring sites waiting for sales. You kinda have to buy a piece now and another later. Eventually, you'll have your own rig. 

List of items in my rig:

* SMC 3"" PMP double pulleys $85 x2

* SMC rigging plate $36

* Sterling SuperStatic 11.1mm Rope 200ft $0 (I bought a spool then sold the rest)

* Petzl I'D S $120

* Van Beest 1/2"" Shackle x3: $21

* ARB 3/4"" Shackle x1: $11

* CAMP Steel D biner x3: $40

* CAMP Lift Ascender: $35

* CAMP small mobile pulley ball bearing: $17

* Alpine Web Lock: $90

* 300 ft of Type-18: $198

* 1.23"" Steel ring x2: $13.50

* Green Spanset 3' x2: $15

* Green Spanset 10'x2: $30

Total about $800 (that's the price of the pulley set on BC)",,False,self,t5_2rbhm,1341558253.0,,,True,t3_w3h66,http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/w3h66/where_to_buy_slackline_rigging_gear/,

What I'm mainly in search of is experience with highline(or even midline) gear, tensioning, and setup techniques so that I can one day (hopefully soon) invest in my own gear and start planning trips with friends (possibly even getting some sort of slacking program started at my University).

Because of the small distance we normally rig, the ratchet system works fine and we can get a nice tight line. For my birthday I got myself a 100ft Perfect Tension line, and while I've found some good places to rig up a longer span, I can't seem to get a good tension on the PT line (IRONY!).

My goal is just to be able to get a 100ft span of nice tight 2"" line. We set up the PT line to the specifications in the instructions (2ft above the ground) and we were touching the ground in the middle... so clearly something is not right. If that's simply a limitation of the line itself... well I'm kinda disappointed. I figured my $130 would buy a nice tight 100ft span with the PT but it's far too loose in the middle for my taste.

I've seen some of the [more advanced rigs](http://i.imgur.com/wcJHL.jpg) here on /r/slackline, but I'm very intimidated coming into this new way to rig lines. Case in point:

[What the fuck is this?!](http://www.balancecommunity.com/images/shop/products/hardware/15-1-Pulley-System-Builder.jpg)


Question 1: Can anybody direct me to some good resources on the basics of ""primitive rigging""? I feel like the block and tackle rigs are intimidating and confusing to me because I don't understand the basics beyond a simple ratchet system yet.

Question 2: Will this different type of rigging be compatible with my existing lines? I would assume so, but I am not entirely sure right now.

**Tl;dr: Looking for resources on primitive rigging, as well as more advanced pulley and lock mechanism rigs.**

I admire those who are dedicated to this sport and willing to spend significant amounts of money on pushing themselves and this sport further.  I've learned a lot from these (you all, actually) guys over the past year or so.  Pussy white-flag waving disclaimer out of the way.


I generally try to buy the safest and best equipment when it comes to holding my line together.  But, when it was time to ditch the ratchet and start thinking about a multiplier... I didn't head to the local rock climbing store.  I went to Lowes, man.  Fkin' Lowes.  Kinda didn't take the WLL of the components in a multiplier setup seriously since they're generally not used to stay in place and hold the system taut.  But... still.  Lowes.


But Holy Hannah, they had everything I needed: [pic of pulley equipment for ghetto multiplier version 0.5a](http://i.minus.com/ib2neShNOmFaoZ.jpg)  Those were Blue Hawk 3/8"" Chain Swivel Pulleys (420lb WLL) at $5.98 each and the ""carabiner"" a Blue Hawk 5/8"" Chain Spring Link (WLL 1500lbs or so) for $3.29.  Don't ask why I have a chain link there.


Worked great for awhile, but the size of what they call a carabiner didn't have much real estate attached with the pulley to be ""girth hitched"" by the rope/tensioning webbing.  Today, I went to grab a slightly bigger ""chain link"" carabiner and [THESE JUST CAME IN!](http://i.minus.com/i1Mk8QBwsP5Ca.jpg)  Double frickin' pulleys (400lb WLL) for ten one dollar bills!  Gonna give these a try later this evening with my Jibline.


All kidding aside... I guess the point I'm trying to make is: there are some things that are safe to be frugal about but don't skim on anything that comes with your line, lockers, carabiners, anchors or whatever else is keeping you up in the air.  (and tree protection too, bastards better not be negelectin' on that.)

I broke it out for a test drive yesterday and it was wonderful.  I began by not being able to stand on it at all, to walking the entire length of the setup in about 3 hr. (not a solid 3 hours on the line, but three hours of being around the slackline.)

Here is how I did it.

* I started out by watching a few [youtube videos](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TzERkdNoyw).  First I practiced balancing on my dominant foot in the middle of the line. It was seemingly impossible to do this but after a good ten min of hopping my left leg up a bout 1/2""-1"" my dominant leg got the hint of what it was supposed to be doing.  All the while I was holding my elbows in the air by my ears like that guy in the video said.  I could only stand on it for a blink of an eye before falling off, this happened for the first 10 minutes or so.

Then I could balance for a second, then 3, then 10!  For the next 40-50 min, I tried to balance longer and longer and then get my left foot on in order to switch.  I got tired of failing and so went to grab a beer and a burger, never did get my left foot on.

After my beer and burger I went to a slackline meetup at Patterson Park in Baltimore!  There I met a few others who have been slackling for a while.  I learned some awesome tips from them and tried out a few other kinds of lines (primitive, trick, and a super long one).  After two hours of hanging with these guys I was able to walk the entire distance of my classic line!  Here are some tips I learned from the other guys, I believe is they're the reason I was able to walk the line in one day.  

* Pick a point on the tree to focus on. (about eye level)
* Breath

As funny as it sounds those two tips are probably the most groundbreaking info for slacking I received.  Hope this helps, and have a blast.

I bought my first pulley system last year, the ninja pulley system from Landcruising with 70m WM. I haven't walked the whole length yet, but I am about 40 meter at the moment and I am pretty confident I will be walking the whole length in the end of the season.

So there is a few things I have been thinking about especially regarding the brake placement. In the normal setup the brake is connected to the becket of the pulley with a 8mm quick link, this makes it easy to release tension because the handle is free to rotate however it definitely put quite a bit of friction on the strands of the rope.

So I have been thinking of getting a rigging plate to avoid this however it will add a bit of weight/cost/complexity to the system. A rigging plate like the DMM bat plate S will work without a twist shackle. Even smaller rigging plates will probably work with a twist shackle in most cases. What do you guys think? Rigging plates seems to be kind of outdated and not that many people are using them anymore especially with the SMC 3"", however with the RE minis there is a lot less space and the will be friction with both horizontal and vertical orientation when used in the embedded position.

Another option is using another sling with the brake. This is cheaper and I already got the gear. All you need is a homemade sling of 1"" tubular and a 8mm bow shackle and your good to go. This makes things more flexible is cheaper but requires more gear than embedded position and is a bit more cumbersome in my opinion.


So what I am asking is how do you connect the brake when using a lightweight pulley system (RE minis, micro smc) ? And do you guys think the friction the imbedded brake introduces have a big impact on how easy it is to tighten the line?


Also at last one more thing. I am using these adjustable slings: (http://www.landcruising-slacklines.de/en/shop/23-schlingen/302-st-baumschlinge-verstellbar) and they are the ones the comes with the kit. The break strength is about 30-35 kn and they are adjustable which is great, however they are a lot weaker than span sets. What do you think guys, would you use these slings with the RE minis?

This second picture shows the yellow tension webbing doing its thing. The top carabiner is attached to the line by means of a dressed girth hitch. I know how this degrades the strength of the webbing. Rather than use a simple single biner as the friction point, I spread this out over two seperate ones to simulate the action of a pulley.

http://i.imgur.com/E8JKZ.jpg 

This image shows the complete setup. You might have noticed that on the purple webbing, I am using the spine of a carabiner in the same way that a rigging ring might be used. This should be OK. This is not crossloading the biner, nor is it loading it along the axis of the spine, its simply using the diameter of the biner body as a weblock. 

So there it is, a modified primitive setup. This was noticibly easier for one person to tension, due to the pulley action of the webbing through the biners, but it is significantly more gear intensive to setup. I have all this gear, so it wasn't a big deal for me, but might be for you if you want to replicate this and don't have 4 piece of webbing, about 8 carabiners, rigging rings and other various accoutrement",,False,self,t5_2rbhm,False,,,True,t3_y6tsk,http://www.reddit.com/r/Slackline/comments/y6tsk/modified_primitive_give_me_feedback/,

I'm not familiar at all with these devices, what I do understand is that I'll have to drill a hole into the rock... put some special epoxy/glue in there, insert the eye bolt, and then wait a period of time for the glue to cure. I already have a drill that's suitable for putting holes in a rock, so that's not a problem. My main concern is the working load limit of the adhesive and installing it properly... I know my line gets up to easily 2500lbs force and I'm worried that I'll rip the eye bolt out of the rock at some point.

I've been a member of this community for a while, and have been slacklining for almost a year now. I built my own 1"" primitive setup and I love it more than anything. I'm able to do a handful of static tricks (knee and double knee drops, front elbow levers etc..) However, I really want to get into more acrobatic tricks. 

From here I know that my options are:

* [Gibbon Jibline/Surfline](http://www.amazon.com/Gibbon-GIJL1015-Slacklines-15M-Jibline/dp/B001RCMR2E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1339987594&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gibbon+jibline)

* [Perfect Tension Performance Line/Pro Line](http://www.perfecttension.com/#/shop/4560836923)

* [Balance Community Rage Line](http://www.balancecommunity.com/RAGEline)

I'm leaning towards the PT or Gibbon side, since the rage line would require me also building a pulley setup (too poor for that).


 I'm aware of how much ratchets suck, and have considered using the method that adam from NW Slackline outlines for tensioning a 2inch line with a primitive setup. I have a concern with this, as well. Would a primitive tensioning system hold up from the rapid dynamic load of a trickline? I once tried doing some butt bounces on my 1"" setup, and my tension came out after only a few jumps.

If that was just a coincidence and the primitive will hold up, then I would definitely drop the extra few bucks on the larger rap rings and the extra webbing to use the primitive setup for my 2"".


So, Gibbon or Perfect Tension?

Basically, I want to know what kind of things you would you would do if you were starting your own collegiate slackline club. Anything from advice on how to teach new members to walk the line to events on campus to how to arrange meetups with other collegiate clubs or how to receive funding and/or gear donations (which are desperately needed!!) would be helpful. 

Speaking of funding, as a student organization we have to go through our student senate to receive funds and since this sport is viewed as 'a potential liability to student safety' things have been a bit difficult to gather enough funds to buy the club some good lines. There are a few of us who have our own lines to use but that brings a lot of wear and tear to personal equipment and as poor college students it gets a bit costly. So, if any of you know people and/or companies who would be willing to help out a startup club of slackliners, we would all really appreciate your help!!

I started slacklining about a week ago, and have gone a few times (my gf bought me a small Gibbon line).  I started using shoes, but didn't feel like I was getting a real good feel for the line.  I began to walk barefoot the next few times, getting better (could walk about halfway across the line).  Yesterday, I started to lose balance, so I stepped off and my pinkie toe lagged behind a bit, and was subsequently broken (now I know why there are shoes warnings).  Just a warning to other beginners that shoes might be smart until you're more comfortable with the line (but I'd like to hear if anyone else has had any similar injuries).  Hasn't hurt my interest, and I hope to get back out (wearing shoes) when I'm all healed up.

I was hanging out with friends at the gym and wanted to setup the line.  The anchors didnt fit and on accident i unknotted one which got me thinking of different ways to setup when your current equipment doesnt meet your needs.

Heres what I did.

Untied both of the anchors, so they're back to being 12.5' (now length) and affixed biners to them, two on one side, one on the other using a slip knot (i think).  The biners stayed locked and then we tied the webbing around the pillars and secured them using a bow knot (common shoelace knot) which tightens as its pulled on.  At that point the anchors were locked in so I setup the line as normal.  

I was a bit worried that the anchors would come loose, but we kept it up for about 2 hours without any trouble which was great because I was able to get two new people to try it out.

Anyone else have an interesting method or story?  

FWIW I only thought of using a slip knot because of one of the other recent threads with pictures and my brain pulled that one out as useful at the time, which it was.

After seeing a few people with them on previous camping trips and watching videos of the sport I decided to buy a Slackline during REI's Memorial Day Sale and give it a shot the next time I went out.

This past weekend I finally made it out to the wilderness with some friends and we set the line up and we discovered rather quickly how much fun and challenging this thing can be.  One thing I noticed while setting up was that my line, no matter how well i tried to line up the anchor points would eventually pull to one side of the ratchet and begin rubbing on the metal housing.  No matter what my friends and i tried we couldn't prevent this strap from slipping over to the left side(facing the ratchet side anchor from the center) which would then cause it to slightly fray at the edges a bit.  

Is this a normal occurrence?  Have i just destroyed my slackline on it's first use?  Do you guys have any tips to help me prevent this alignment issue and future wear on the strap?

I recently came into the possession of a 30m (100ft) Gibbon Surfline and tried to set it up this weekend. We set it up between two trees about 25 paces apart (about 20m I believe) and thing comes with a monster size ratchet but even so, I wasn't able (or brave enough) to tension it enough to hold my weight at the centre of the line. I weigh only about 60kg (135llbs). Initially I had it set up at the only height recommended by Gibbon which is 50cm. We raised that to about 1m but still the sag was enough that we were touching the ground when walking to the middle.

What are your recommendations for lines of this length? How tight should the line be? How big should the sag be on a 30m line? Should I go past the recommended 2.5x turns of the ratchet to up the tension, or should I set the line up even higher? Also, how does this change when using a 1inch primitive set up, does a thinner line usually require more or less tension?

I've been getting some good use out of my PTEN pro line, but I'm starting to notice some small abrasions in the line. These slacklines do not last forever, so I'm starting to research what my next line is going to be. Originally, I was just going to get myself a Gibbon Surfline, but I'm starting to get better at walking longer distances so I'm investigating 1"" and 1.25"" lines. 

The question now is whether I should go for a standard 1"" line, or shell out for the pricier but bouncier 1.25"" RageLine. I really like the bouncing and dynamic nature of the Jib &amp; PTEN Pro lines that I have... so I'm not sure how much I'll like regular 1"" webbing.

Does anybody have any experience with the RageLine? How does it compare to a 2"" line? The rounded edges look nice, I think that in itself will be an upgrade over the 2"" lines that I'm using. The RageLine also looks to have a much higher WLL, which is good because I like my lines nice and tight.

I think I'm going to get about 250ft of it if I go that route, so I really want to make sure it's something I'm going to enjoy before I plunk down a serious chunk of change.

I slacklined about 2-3 days a week for the first couple months but then my slackline broke. 

Around the time of the line breaking, I experienced some terrible lower-back pain. I figured it didn't have to do with slacklining since it just started hurting after 2 months of doing it and not 2 days. I went to the doctor because it got pretty bad, but he gave me the typical ""take some Advil and come back if it doesn't stop"" advice (I'm 17 by the way, so it's not an age thing).

I got a new slackline after about a month of not having one, and after the first day of having it, I experienced the same pain, so I'm pretty positive it's the slacklining causing this pain.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had this pain, and if so, how they prevented it, like certain stretches or workouts. 

I'm not the most fit person in the world but I'm not really out of shape or anything, and I don't do anything too extreme on it, just trying to stay on it longer, walk further, etc. I land on my feet pretty much all the time too and the slackline is only between waist and knee height, so it's not that kind of thing. Anyway, please help! I love slacklining, and I don't want this to prevent me from doing it.

We still need to get more memory cards, GoPros, and a remote control quad-copter rig for the GoPro for some sweet aerial shots!

This is where you come in! We are fundraising the last bit of the necessary funds through a Kickstarter and need your help! If you could spread the word, or better yet back us (even a few dollars goes a long way!), we can make this project a reality! 

For those of you unfamiliar with Kickstarter it is all or nothing so if we don't meet our goal we won't be able to get all the necessary equipment. We do have some sweet rewards for backers though such a DVD with extras or a limited supply of belts made out of the blue type 18 webbing from the shoot!

I didn't realize how much I'd end up liking slacklining and have been playing on it almost all my spare time. I can walk it, turn, walk it again pretty consistently. Been learning some basic tricks too.

Last week, I got to try a gibbon surfline for the first time. Super fun and setup at near full length. Its like a whole new challenge, on a stretchier longer line. I want to buy one from the Clymb while its on sale, but don't really have the 80 bucks to spare. 

Has anyone tried just running a long 1"" webbing from an anchor through this gibbon classic ratchet? Seems like its the cheapest route to a longer line if it would be a safe setup (admittedly a ghetto frankenstein of a line)

WE PROVIDE A MAXIMUM TENSION OF 6500lbs. Which is less than our actual breaking strength and stitch pattern break strength. 

In addition to this we have dyno’d what our ratchets can do and know  that our ratchets will never get anywhere near this max tension. (However, our ratchets provide more than enough of torque for tricklining which is our only actual goal!!! ) ***
The reason there is such a big gap from what our ratchets can do(3000lbs if you’re the hulk) and the real limit, is because we do not want people pushing the envelope with pulley systems. 99% of slackliners have very little knowledge about how much force they are exerting on the webbing (Dyno’s are expensive).  JUST USE COMMON SENSE. (we know that pulleys may not lead to as much abrasion) JUST USE COMMON SENSE. WE PROVIDE A MAXIMUM TENSION OF 6500lbs. webbing degrades over time, due to a number of things including but not limited to- sunlight, heat, abrasion, dust, germs, silly string, tea, smiles, unicorn hair.. basically the stuff is degrades over time...   

We think that any company that provides actual breaking strength is taking an enormous risk. Once that webbing leaves the loom it IS going to degrade. The break strengths can vary. Even Mil spec will vary by whatever amount of standard deviations are acceptable to that particular webbing... 

***everyone has complaints about ratchets and we understand. They are dangerous. This is why we explain proper use in our warning booklet. Once you understand how the ratchet works the risk of injury will decrease significantly.  

Hope that answers any unanswered questions!
