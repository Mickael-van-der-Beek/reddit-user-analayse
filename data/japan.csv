After much thought, I have decided to keep the video public.  I have disabled the comments for the time being to remove any private information of mine.  

As many of you have said, taking the video down would be counter to the purpose of the video, which is to raise awareness on the issue of discrimination in Japan.  

A few Japanese friends have told me that if I don't talk about it or bring it up, people will forget and it will eventually go away.  
I disagree.  If that were the case, Japan wouldn't be trying to raise awareness on the issue of bullying like it has been in recent years.  

The first step to solving a problem is to see it. 

I would appreciate any help you have to offer, and please share the video.

Where is it that you suggest I should go?  
With my child, I entered the frozen meat section.  
Upon whence you gazed upon my caucasian complexion.

With a turn of head, speaking to your partner swiftly.  
That German language, that you thought was stealthy.  
""Stupid American, stockpiling junk food"" you pretensed.  
Not one bit aware of the irony in this sentence.  

Your fat wife mithered ""Americans in Japan are rarely rich"".  
Luckily for me then that I am not American, I am Irish.  
""He's probably on holiday, or working illegally"".  
Never once noticing my half-asian baby.  

Your own children, early-teenage, on a bed they did trample.  
They stared at me as I ate a tasty free sample.

We met again, upon checking out; even then your opinion did not doubt.  
""Does he even have money to support his child?"", you laughed, ""  
As your children screamed running down the path.  

But then, in a moment of grace and poise.  
I started to speak, to provide my baby noise.  

Not French, Japanese, or English like a Gentleman,  
The next words from my mouth were actually German.  

Avast, Motherfucker! Your ruse was rumbled.  
Another gaijin is on your patch, your secret language crumbled.  

So what now, cunt? Will you stop coming to Cost-co?  
Your youngest child was wearing sandals from Daiso.  

-FIN

This is a true story. These two Germans looked like they were in their 40s, and it shocked me since I have only seen this kind of snobby hatred in others my own age. They looked genuinely annoyed that I understood German, not embarrassed, just annoyed.

So, why do foreigners seem to hate each other in Japan?

I've lived in America, Thailand, Korea, South America and I've never seen anything like it.

What usually happens is I'll go out, meet a few people at bars, restaurants, shops, etc and strike up a conversation (either I start it or they do).   Eventually one of us leaves and we exchange info.  Sometimes I'll suggest we meet up again for a drink/food and sometimes they suggest it.    So I'll end up sending them a message at some point (a few days later or a week later) and most of them don't even respond.    The really weird part is that many people will send me a friend request on facebook and still not respond to messages.   If they do respond it just sounds like they're using lame excuses.

I've also had girls give me fake e-mail addresses.   I mean, holy shit.   Maybe I just look like a goddamn serial killer or rapist.  The past couple weeks I haven't even bothered asking people for contact info and I wait for them to ask.   It still ends up the same.

I'll verify my identity if you want me to.

I recently made a video about Racism in Japan, and am currently getting bombarded with some pretty harsh, irrational comments from Japanese people who think I am purposefully attacking Japan.  These guys are like those people in those black vans that blare their loud speakers, but instead of high volume speakers, they flood the comments section with confusion and spin.  And they flag Japanese comments that support my video as spam.  

I think if you watch the video in full, you can see I am only trying to bring awareness to the issue with the help of some historical and present day examples.  

I don't think racism is any worse in Japan than other countries. As a Japanese-American, I know first hand how racist America can be. 

Anyway, I just wanted to share a PM I received from a Japanese person that was too afraid to write this in the comments section because of how he/she may be attacked by other Japanese people.  (I really hate this kind of bullying because it prevents free speech.) 

It seems like there are a lot of good Japanese speakers/readers here so I won't translate it.  (Plus, I'm also too tired to translate it right now)



本当は、日本語でコメントを残したかったのですが（日本人の人にも読んでほしくて...）でも、ポストできず、英語にしましたが文字数が全く足りず...涙、目玉先生に、私の母国語である日本語でも意見を伝えたくて、書き込みをした日本語のコメント+をお送りしたくてPMしてしまいました。

バカちょんカメラ...聞いたことあります。悪気があったわけではない状態で普通に家族で使っていました。でも、意味が分かって一斉に利用をやめましたが...

部落差別のある村で少し生活をした事がありますが、実際きちんと状況について教えてもらった事がありません。ただ噂話のように ""あそこに住む人は北朝鮮人だから...""と指をさす人がいました。日本語を話す人達だったので実際本当に朝鮮半島の方なのか否か分からなかったので私は無視して普通に接していましたが...すごく深い傷を持って生きている人たちがいるのは少しだけ耳にしたことがあります。やはり、自分が対象になってないから大したことじゃない!精神が強いようです。

私が1つ思う事は、（日本だけを基準で書きますが）自分達のした事で非のあることはあまり実際学校では習わない・教えない感じを受けます。父と第二次世界大戦の話になった際に、日本が近隣国に対して行った行動はあまり取り上げられていないことがわかり、父が驚いて、真実は知っておくべきだ！と日本の行動を反日的ではなくただ事実として話してくれました。具体的にかいてしまうと、すぐに""日本人のくせに反日だ！海外に住んでるからって...""ということを言われてることがあるので本当に意見を公にて分かち合うのは大変です。

日本では日本の非と受け止められてしまう（そういう気持ちがなくても）事は、すぐこのように'反日'という印象を与えてしまう可能性があるから心配...と避けられているような気がしますが、どう思われますか?　学校でこのような話をする先生がいたら、きっとどこかで『反日だ!』と少なくはなってきてるとしても言う方がいるような気がします。

私は生まれも育ちも日本ですが、1つどうしてもわからないことがあるのです。もちろんすべての人ではありませんが、なぜ日本人はある種の""defensive""な行動をとるのでしょうか？　意見を、そうだね、考えてみよう! という人もいるとは思いますが、すぐに ""そんなこと...""そして""日本人ではない人がそんな話をして！反日だ"" と頭ごなしにしてしまう...残念なことだと思います。

国際人を育てたい日本は、海外からの人達の意見や考え方にもっと耳を傾けなくてはいけないと私は思うのです。そしてうまく意見を交換する。これは別の話になっていしまうので辞めておきます笑

長々となってしまってごめんなさい。
私はコメディータッチの目玉先生のビデオも、今回の人種差別についてのビデオも大好きです。ニコニコ動画の生放送で深くではないですが、人種差別の話をしたことがありますが、気が付いている人がたくさんいましたよ。なので、日本もそこまで真っ暗ではないとは思いますが、もっと親の世代が子供とこの様な話をしなくてはいけないと思います。

I'm staying at my girlfriend's family's house. It's just her and I there so this morning I woke up and offered to go to the konbini to get some breakfast for us. As with most place in Japan, it's only a few minutes walk. 

I was busy LINE'ing my friend on the way to the konbini, not really paying attention to anything. As I get opposite the store, I look up and see a police car drive by with 3 guys inside. They all look at me and the drive instantly jams on the breaks. All 3 of them get out and and surround me. I was kind of half asleep before this but it made me wake up instantly. 

The first policeman starts talking to me in Japanese, and thankfully I was awake enough now to understand him and talk back. He asked my name and I handed him my foreigner card. He couldn't read the Romaji so I gave him my national insurance card which has my name is Katakana. While this was happening I looked down at the paper in his hand and noticed there was a name written on it in Katakana. Thankfully it wasn't mine, so I explained to him that I live in Tokyo and that I'm here in holidays. I'm just buying breakfast, can I help him with anything? He then said that everything was fine for me and he was looking for another foreigner (even saying gaikokujin instead of gaijin). He was very polite, and so was I. He then apologised for taking my time and they all left.

I just wanted to tell this story because I've read a lot of stories on here about people getting upset about being stopped because you are a foreigner. It's the price you pay to be in Japan. I accept that sometimes this will happen and while it was unpleasant for about 15 seconds, everything turned out fine and no harm was done.

Link to gallery - http://imgur.com/a/cEbcl

A while back my mom found Yukifumi Shibasaki on Instagram. He's a graphic designer/photographer/artist. She showed me his feed and I started following him too because I really loved his work. Through Facebook and commenting on each other's photos my mom and him became friends.

One day, out of the blue, he said that he was so grateful for all the support and compliments we gave him on his art that he wanted to send us a painting. And so he sent us a package from Japan to New Zealand that included a beautiful original oil painting, a letter, a collection of flyers he had designed, and a cute little illustration done by his girlfriend (see the gallery link for pictures).

I was just so struck by this gesture, sending us this gorgeous painting all because he was moved by our comments on his art. I wanted to share this because his story really touched my heart. Every now and then you'll come across people who will surprise you entirely and show you the best of humankind. It just goes to show that genuine connections can be made over the internet. I really admire him for being able to be so positive after all he's been through. If you read the letter you'll see that he's had a pretty rough time over the last few years - divorce, losing his business, debt, having go to onto welfare, and suffering depression. And now he's hoping to build a new career around his paintings. It makes me feel so happy that mine and my mom's words have given him confidence in his work.

Here's the links to his Instagram and Flickr accounts if anyone would like to see his other work:

Most people in the building have seen me before, but perhaps not this particular 20-something girl, who I found myself behind while waiting for the elevator. She might have been freaked out at the thought of riding up alone with a gaijin, but I was in a fog and not really paying attention. 

As we're waiting, I hear her mumble, ""Good morning"" followed by ""Good job!"" I didn't reply, cause I'm trying to figure out if she was talking to me, considering it was evening and I hadn't really done anything to merit the pat on the back. And she was facing the elevator.

After a moment, I figured out she was trying to say ""Hi"" and ""Otsukaresama,"" but by then it was too late to reply, so I just got in the elevator. She pushed 3 and I pushed 7.

We get to the 3rd floor and she feels the need to bow out to me as she exits. As she anticipates the door opening, she gives a quarter turn so she's vaguely acknowledging me out of the corner of her eye, and she goes to give a major bow-to-the-emperor type bow. As the door hadn't completely opened yet, she wacks her head on the door with all her might.

I was speechless and as surprised as she was as she bolted for her apartment. It was an awesome awkward performance, like a scene from The Office.

I know; not an epic story, but maybe some of you will contribute your own better ones!

A Shimane JET was arrested about 6 weeks ago and is being held for trying to import 6.9 *grams* of MJ via the postal system. He has been charged but his first court date isn't until February next year. 

It's a foregone conclusion that he will be held in custody until the completion of his trial. Trials here are very open ended, a ""quick"" trial would probably wrap up in the autumn next year but it could easily take longer.

He faces up to 5 years in the slammer but as a first offender a suspended sentence, deportation, and a *lifetime ban* is more likely -- on top of the year+ he'll be stuck in jail of course. Even people with PR and Japanese spouses can be deported and banned for simple possession of small quantities of MJ.

Personally I find Japan's strict MJ laws to be pretty hypocritical considering the situation with drinking and tobacco. However we don't get to make the laws and the laws here are really, really strict when it comes to MJ and any other substance deemed illegal.

Be smart, abuse your liver like the locals and leave the herbs (etc) for outside Japan.

Edit: It seems some people think I am expecting sympathy for this guy. I'm not. He fucked up and he knew better. All JETs are warned very strongly about Japanese drug laws at their orientation. I posted this here simply as a warning to those who may be thinking that ""Hey, it's only a little bit, it'll be okay..."" It's not okay, and the repercussions are insanely harsh.

Either way, it is still closure for the family, and we are all anticipating some local memorial service to commemorate the great life he led.

**Edit 2** Thank you all, sincerely, for your kind messages and support. I haven't heard yet about a local memorial, but I'm sure it's due soon.

It's been a while since I again posted this information.

In case if anyone here is unaware what a host club is, it is a “club” where players known as “hosts” entertain guests while we all drink (alcohol/non-alcohol), entertain via performance, conversations, champagne calls and etc., and have fun overall.

I understand that there are negative views on hosts in general, even in Japan. However, I assure you that it’s actually quite different than what you’d expect – as it was for me when I first joined.

----

= Who might be interested : =

* You like drinking, having fun, being entertained and having a kickass time, then this would interest you.

* You want to experience the nightlife of Japan, but cannot speak Japanese? Guess who speaks Japanese *and* English!

* You want to see what Japanese men have to offer.

----

= About the club =

* We are the largest scale club spread nation-wide.

* We offer one of the most cut-edge Hako (or ""club room"").

* We work in the morning times, and the club is less expensive than other clubs.

* 
[The Club](http://www.host2.jp/shop/radio/system.html)

----

= System =

* The club operating hours are from 9AM to 2:30PM (last order).

* I-Lunch Time starts from 12PM to last (Sets are 2,000 yen)

* I-Alcohol Time starts after performance at 1PM (15 minutes champagnes are cheaper and you get free beer)

* Closed on Mondays and Tuesdays

New Comers/Service Fee

2 Hours/2,000 yen

Free Time/5,000 yen

Shimei/3,000 yen

**Note:** New Comers are offered with Shochu (equivalent to Japanese vodka) and mixing-drinks. All you can drink.

**Note 2:** You will be met with all the hosts who will ask for your number/e-mail address (unless you mention that you do not want us to prior to seating).

**Note 3:** You can come as new comer up to 3 times if you cannot find a Tanto.

**IMPORTANT:** I should mention that when you enter, you must provide a picture ID of yourself, regardless of age. You will either need **ONE** **passport** *or* **driver's license** ... *OR* ... **THREE** IDs with at least **ONE** picture ID (such as **high school yearbook, student ID, etc.**) and **TWO** other IDs that you can identify your name with (such as **credit cards, cash cards, life insurance, student ID**)

All new comers (even those who return as new comers) will be asked for picture ID until you choose a Tanto, which then you will need not to bring anymore, I believe.

----

Frequent Comers/Service Fee

2 Hours/5,000 yen

VIP Room/7,000 yen

Table Check (If you exceed 2 hours)/Added 2,000 yen

Shimei/3,000 yen

**Note:** 35% tax and service tax apply.

**Note 2:** Champagne will be cheaper during “I-Alcohol Time.” You will be serviced with free beer.

**Note 3:** Expensive bottles and Shochu will be labeled as ""keep bottles,"" which means if you don't finish what's left, you'll be served the same bottle the next time (so you do not buy Shochu and etc. everytime).

----

I-Alcohol Time/Service Fee

Listel/9,000 yen

Asty/15,000 yen

Segura/30,000 yen

Voovoo Rose/50,000 yen

Spending time before going to the club, and then entering the club together.

* **""シャンパンコール/Champagne Calls""**

A “chug chant” mixed with music where you are given the privilege of hogging **ALL** hosts for 10~ minutes. You then chug down while other hosts chug down on champagne with you straight out of the bottle. More entertaining than it sounds.

* **""ビンダ/Binda""**

Drinking straight from bottle.

* **""ヘルプ/Help""**

Hosts who are not Tanto and are there to entertain you.

= FAQs =

== About the club ==

**Q.** Who are allowed to your club?

**A.** Under the company rules, which state, ""Please understand that we do not allow anyone who resemble a male appearance,"" we allow female customers only. However, we do allow clients who are *obviously* gay.

----

**Q.** Okay, do you allow transgender?

**A.** I believe we do.

----

**Q.** What kind of clients are there?

**A.** Mostly range from 19 to high 30s. Majority are business women and school girls who are looking for a good time. However, there are also a good number of hostesses, kyaba girls, snack-moms and rich clients.

----

**Q.** Can we non-Japanese work as a host?

**A.** If you have a Japanese citizenship, yes.

----

**Q.** Are foreign clients welcome?

**A.** We welcome all equally.

**Q.** Do the clients have to be fluent in Japanese?

----

**Q.** Does your club engage in catch?

**A.** No, we do not. We abide by the law as much as possible.

----

**Q.** What’s the difference between a host club and hostess club?

**A.** Aside from gender, there's actually not much difference. However, one of the key differences I've noticed is that hosts are nominated based on looks, conversation skills, entertainment skills, etc. Hostess tends to be looks and sexiness.

----

**Q.** Is there a dress code?

**A.** Don't come in naked.

----

**Q.** Are the hosts in your club pressurized into drinking?

**A.** Nope. Our Tokyo-area president never touched alcohol and climbed up the ladder.

----

----

**Q.** Do you bang your customers?

He had a good time, and I had a good time hanging out with him.
He's not interested in the same things as most of the other kids, which is fine.
Today they were playing in the water.

Like a little knee deep pool not his cup of tea, so I didn't put him in.

Now, to be allowed to enter the pool or to go swimming in the larger pool
everyone needs to have their asshole tested for parasites.

Every parent and child who may be using the pool must have used this special test kit, like a piece of cardboard with a hole cut out and some tape there.  You have to stick the tape on your arse and the whole thing becomes a microscope slide so they can check for parasite eggs.

Parasites which are not good swimmers and not easily transmitted in swimming pools anyway.

So, none of this is done in the west.  Yet the asshole parasite problem is probably exactly the same as it is in Japan: nonexistent.

So today, as some of the other kids are getting into the pool their parents first remove their diapers then put on their swim trunks then they shower, which is normal before getting into a pool.  But there is one teacher at the shower with a soap dispenser washing the arses of all the kids before they get into the pool.

So, all this nonsense for having a clean arse and this woman wore the same fucking glove to wash every arse.

I'm sure she was using antibacterial soap, but the parasites everyone had to have the test done for is not a bacterium, it's a worm and that soap doesn't do shit.

But if you touch everyone's arse with the same glove, I'm sure that's a much more likely method of spreading them.

Japan has OCD coupled with a complete lack of common sense

Just in case this happens to you: filling out a police report for a lost in Japan is tough, as it has to be written in Katakana only. The only allowed words in Romaji are your name (which has to be additionally transscripted into Katakana as well) and ""Visa, Mastercard, Maestro"".  
And you have to write it *by yourself*. Though they might pre-write it on a sheet of paper to help you. After that you will get a numbered ticket which will also serve as a pickup number in the police station, in case it gets returned to them. You are kindly asked to report the police if you found your item by yourself (like in my case, it still was kept in the store where I thought I had lost it). And you should do so. But this on the other hand only takes 1 minute.

On the way back down I came across a group of young Japanese people carrying signs. In the middle of them was a man, determinedly making it to the top of the mountain. Nothing particularly unusual except that he had two prosthetic legs.

I didn't realise this until I had started to block his path. Urgent repeating ""すみません"" and ""ごめんあさい"", I moved out the way. A friend of his approached me and explained (in English) he had lost both legs last year and that he was now determined to make it all the way to the top.

I was floored. Maybe it was the length of the day, the weariness of making my own, rather insignificant journey to the top of the mountain but I was utterly lost for words. I was genuinely moved to tears. This man was pacing upwards with all his might and it looked like he was using all the strength he could possibly muster. Around him were a group of friends, 10 or so, cheering him on at every possible moment.

All I could do to utter a ""がんばっれ"". His friend said he was amazing for attempting this, I agreed. When I finally recovered the ability to speak, I told him I thought it was incredible. I meant it, but not just because of the heroic efforts of a single man to not be defined by an accident. But because the people accompanying him were genuinely by his side, doing all they could to help him and they were so proud of him, you couldn't help but feel the same way.

I just needed an outlet for that incredibly heartwarming moment that happened to me in Japan today. If anyone anywhere has any information on that man, I'd love to know more. If not, all I can do is be glad I had the fortune to meet someone who was genuinely awe-inspiring.

Bad thing is that it looks to be 16:9 compressed to 4:3 in many cases, but it's still way nicer than KeyHole TV and others. The site is also very clean looking.

**Update 1:** 10 kilo area is said to be the danger zone. they just said that at this time the rods have melted but most radiation is still being shielded by the building. People in the area please stay calm and follow evacuation instructions.

**Update 2:** According to the talking head on ABC (Japan TV) this will NOT be another chernobyl. The nuclear reaction is shut down during an earthquake. In Chernobyl it was a run away nuclear meltdown, here it is a meltdown because the rods were still hot after it was shut down. There will still be radiation but will be easier to contain.

**Update 3:** They are having problems keeping coolant in. The level of the coolent is slowly going down. If this increases the other rods will melt and there is a chance that the 10 kilo evacuation circle will be increased but at this time only a part of the rods are thought to have melted and radiation is being contained. 

Also they are having problems with Fukushima #2. The vents that get rid of steam are not working properly. 

**Update 4:** There was the sound of something exploding around 3:30 (4 people have been taken to the hospital), and they now have readings of radiation so high that if you are near it you get one year's worth radiation in one hour. The news did not say where the readings were taken. 

**Update 5:** The TV ticker says the building holding the rods has collapsed.

**Update 6:** The line that the radiation reading (a year's worth in 1 hour) was taken was on the line that is drawn between the reactor area and public area (border?).  I just directly translated that. I guess they mean on the edge of the reactor land?!

**Update 7:**  10km evac area has just been increased by 10km. 20km area evacuation area has just been announced. (7:00pm tokyo time)

**Update 8:** IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) will be holding an emergency meeting from 8:00p.m. (tokyo time)  to deside what is needed to be done.

**Update 9:** The people evacuated by bus from the surrounding cities do not have a destination. For tonight they have joined others in evacuation spots (community centers, schools) but the numbers are causing logistical problems. 

**Update 10: **The explosion was from Hydrogen which caused the outer wall to blowout. The container holding the radioactive material was not broken. **Radioactive material has not been released at high levels. The radioactive levels that were taken earlier have dropped at a considerable rate.**

**Update 11: **At this time they are using ocean water to cool the reactor down. It will take 5 hours to do this (they just said to totally fill the chamber will take 10 days). The ocean water will be used to cool the outside as they continue to use pumps to cool the inside.

**Last Update for now** cause it looks like we won't learn anything new for a while. To translate what the tv people were saying about radiation levels being high at the time of the explosion. This is of course conjecture on their part but here goes...

 The coolant levels dropped exposing the tops of the rods. Some of the rods melted. At the same time a chemical reaction caused an increase of hydrogen. The explosion happened and with the rods exposed high levels of radiation are detected. Rods are again covered with coolant. Radiation levels drop.

Need advice.",you4president,194,27,201,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1dszrc/i_was_in_a_car_accident_im_being_fined_and_could/,"   Hello. I was in a accident about 2 months ago during a blizzard in northern Japan. The road was completely covered in snow and and oncoming car started to slide into my lane from around a corner, i stepped on the breaks and we collided somewhere near the center line but in my lane (which you couldn't even see in the snow). We were not going too fast, maybe 30kph, I was ok, i immediatly checked on the other driver and she said she was ok as well. I dont speak much Japanese at all, I am American and i haven't been here for very long. So i couldn't really ask her many questions but she seemed to be fine, out of the car and walking around.
   I could see her leaning into the back seat of her car and I was worried there could be another person in the back seat. I got closer and saw a young child laying down in the back seat, the mother was covering her with a blanket, talking to her getting no response. I paniced. ""oh my god is she dead?"" thinking to my self. ""what do i do?""  Right then the police and ambulance showed up and i immediately told them to check on the child and they did, and took her away in a stretcher, while her mother screamed at the sky, at me, at her child. I quickly asked an EMT if the child was dead, he said ""no.""  I was so relieved. A weight lifted. I could still hear the chatter from the gathering crowd, ""baka gaijin"" being the only thing i could make out. And one older man even throwing a snowball at me from the crowd. I was escorted away quickly by the EMTs. I was fine, spend a couple hours in the hospital, went home, went to sleep. 
   Went to the police station, filled a police report the next day. 
   Few days later the insurance informs me that is was 50-50 fault. I was a little suprised but I accepted that. They also informed me that the child in the back seat, a girl age 8, was put into a coma from  the accident. Suffering a brain injury. I was so shocked because we were going so slowly , how could such a serious injury take place? I was then told she was NOT wearing a seatbelt, and hit her head. 
   Few weeks later I have to go back into the police station and i am charged with injuring someone while driving? or something like that. The police told me I will be fined, or imprisoned if i do not pay the fine. The fine is 300.000Yen, so around 3,000$ and i have no way of affording that. i am completely broke and i havent even started working here yet. 

TL;DR:: I was in a car accident, 50-50 fault. Other car had a child NOT wearing a seatbelt and was put into a coma, I have been fined 3,000$ for injuring her. 
    
  Like i said i am somewhat new here, i dont know very much Japanese. Im not sure if i can talk with someone, or the county prosecutor about doing some community service or something? But a friend said it doesnt work like that , and i will have to get a loan, and the money is a way of saying sorry. Is there no way i can defend myself? The other driver lied about her child wearing a seatbelt on her report. 
  Im sorry for the wall of text, and errors. Just wanted to get it off my chest. I dont know a lot of people here in Japan, and this community has always been pleasant company.

EDIT 1: The girl is out of the coma, and has been released from the hospital. 

EDIT 2: Apparently there is some confusion. The fact that I am responsible at all is bs. She was speeding, slid into my lane, and collided with me. The fact that it is 50-50 fault, is bogus. If I were at all responsible, or if i lost control and slid into her lane, or even into the middle, i would not have a problem paying the consequences. But that is not the case. She lied, and who knows who else lied, so that the blame would be shared.

EDIT 3: Wow, i really appreciate such responses. Made me feel so much better. I have spoke with several legal offices and have come to the realization that there is not much i can do/ or want to do, at this point. The case has been filed, it was really my word vs hers when it comes to the child not wearing a seatbelt, and apparently they took hers. I was told that it should have been no more than 10% my fault, but that i would still have to pay a fine regardless. I was told that even if i was at a stop light, and she rear ended me, i would be charged with the same crime. Such is the law in Japan. The money for the fine is a very important gesture i was told. And that refusing to pay would result in a much heavier crime. I have two weeks to pay the 3,000$",,False,,t5_2qh2u,1367892233.0,,,True,t3_1dszrc,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1dszrc/i_was_in_a_car_accident_im_being_fined_and_could/,

I've just been alerted to the fact that one of our fellow Brits, long-term and well-known Tokyo resident Garin Dart, has been missing since last Wednesday (May 22) at 1100. Anyone who knows Garin - either as a friend or businessperson - will appreciate that this is really out of character. Garin runs a highly successful events company, Bluesilver, and has a young family here in Japan. 

He went missing on May 22nd after 11a.m. He was going from his office in Nogizaka to a meeting at the Hilton apparently.

If anyone has any information, email and other contact information may be found [here](http://foreignvolunteers.org/2013/05/29/garin-dart-missing/ )

We all know that this place is a common destination for people who are coming to Japan.  They want to ask about JR passes and what's off the beaten path and so forth.  But a lot of people here would prefer not to have travel questions posted here, so they downvote and/or complain at the asker.  This results in both sides being grumpy: the residents get annoyed that people are constantly asking questions, and the visitors are confused about why everybody is so mean in /r/japan.

If we could get people posting in /r/JapanTravel it might help reduce the frustration all around.  People who are happy to help travelers can continue to do so, and travelers can get answers without bothering people who don't want to talk with them.

Of course there will still be travel posts here, just as there are still pictures despite /r/JapanPics, translation requests despite /r/Translator, etc.  But maybe we can achieve a bit better balance if we start using /r/JapanTravel, and everybody can be a little happier.

I've posted a couple of links over there and modmailed to ask that a link be added to /r/japan.  If you are one of those who enjoys helping travelers, please consider submitting links there and helping redirect travelers over there.

If my friend invites me to his band's gig and I don't want to go, I won't say ""I'd rather spend the evening jerking off to midget porn than listening to your crappy band"" but something like ""Man, I'd really like to go, but..."" and make up some excuse. If this dialogue happens in Japan, everybody is like ""OMG honne and tatemae!"", in any other country no-one will think twice about it.

Be it at work, at home, even talking to strangers, we constantly hide our true thoughts and lie to varying degrees in order to build and maintain relations, keep the peace, save face, prevent others from losing face. Heck, all of international diplomacy is about the contrast between true intentions and keeping up appearances.

I'd like to share my updates to counter some fear mongering.,johnwalkr,147,14,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/g3l35/i_live_in_sendai_and_am_ok_id_like_to_share_my/,"I'm moving to a new location so I'm just quickly copy-pasting this from multiple facebook notes/[blog posts](http://www.inertreactants.com/?p=237). There might be some repeated statements, etc. I'm in Japan on an internship related to a [google lunar x-prize team](http://www.whitelabelspace.com/2011/03/rover-prototype-body-complete.html).

**update 1:**
I am OK in Sendai, as is everyone I know here. Thank you everyone for the messages.

They are already starting to restore power and water to the city of Sendai.

The earthquake itself was pretty scary but afterwards everything is very well organized; we waited outside after the earthquake and eventually were allowed to grab our stuff from the lab. We left quickly after an aftershock and possible gas leak. At my dorm we are staying together in a group.

Where I am located in the city I don't have running water or power but we are safe with lots of food and water.

Although the shaking was quite violent, there are no buildings in the city itself that collapsed and flooding was confined to the subway system as far as I know. We knew it was serious right away as it was the first time we heard the early warning detection alarm (3 seconds before) and it was impossible to stay standing.

It was much worse to the West where soil conditions are worse and to the East where tsunamis hit. We weren't aware of how serious things were until we heard news reports.

In the city today, restaurants were giving free food and people were in good spirits, although you can see smoke from fires near the coast and there are smaller fires in the city.

Local groups are also making rice and soup for people. Basically the same food I've been eating since I arrived, but it's not lukewarm like at the cafeteria!

Convenience stores were open today, where people patiently lined up in the dark to buy a couple of day's worth of food each. I got food there, and was also given food by the school, as well as flashlights and batteries.

Amazingly, a handful of stores and bars where even open by the main station this afternoon.

There are buildings designated as refuges where people in tall and evacuated buildings are staying.

The news images are not from Sendai city, they are from surrounding areas. The aftershocks were quite large and frequent until this morning but have subsided now.

The nuclear reactors are not posing a serious risk according to local media, and despite the recent explosion widespread fallout is not a strong possibility for this type of plant and failure.

We are not sure if/when we can go back to the lab. Many experiments were damaged but our rover was OK when we left it. I am uploading pictures from the lab and city now.

I'm currently with friends in the city centre where we found power and 3G internet. I should be able to update occasionally directly and via friends (email is sporadically working on my phone).

I want to stress that I am OK and in a safe place.

**update 2:**
Update: the rover is ok and in my dorm. Many are leaving Sendai by (free) bus, but the lineups are up to 500m long and you can only go North (ish).

The journey to Tokyo is indirect and about 20 hours. It looks like convenience stores and supermarkets are out of food but military trucks are starting to arrive with supplies, and there are neighborhood food storage buildings. Today more restaurants were open, selling take-away versions of their food but selling out quickly.

Where there is power, ATMs and vending machines work. Bicycle stores are booming but I haven't heard of the gas station situation one way or another.

Life downtown is pretty normal. Inspections appear to have started today and some are back at work.

Still no power or running water in my area but we have lots of supplies.

A main concern is aftershocks of up to M7, but that's 100 times less energetic than the original earthquake. People are also concerned about the nuclear reactor failure in Fukushima but my understanding, with Rob's (nuclear medicine specialist) help, is that it's not very dangerous for us, 80km away.

**update 3:**
Many people are leaving Sendai, but it is very difficult to go South to Tokyo, which is where most need to go. At the moment it is a 500m bus lineup followed by an apparently 20 hour long journey. They will run out of fuel in a day or two but I think it won't take long to start getting more, as food only took one day to start arriving.

I'm the only english speaker left at my dorm, so I am heading to stay with another group of people on the ground floor of an apartment building.

I already had a bus ticket to Tokyo for this weekend. I have no idea if I can get on that bus. It will need to be rerouted as normally it goes though Fukushima.

University is closed until at least May. My internship was supposed to end in late April. My current plan is to get to Tokyo when I can, and then make a decision on staying to finish my work or leaving.

There is a small amount of work to get part of our GLXP rover to Europe for testing and demonstrations. I will be bringing those parts to Tokyo in order to ship them. The rest of the rover is safe in my dorm.

If I get stuck in Sendai I should be safe. There were a couple of large (M6?) aftershocks today and they are expected for one month up to M7 (100 times less energy than the original). There is plenty of food and water available and my dorm now has water, power and internet.

The main concern is nuclear fallout but from what I understand of the design and situation of the reactors were are reasonably safe. Preventative medicine is available if it is needed and the worst case scenario does not involve danger at short-term exposure lengths.

Many thanks to the heroic nuclear workers who have sacrificed their lives keeping the country safe.",,False,,t5_2qh2u,False,,text tohoku,True,t3_g3l35,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/g3l35/i_live_in_sendai_and_am_ok_id_like_to_share_my/,

I found a camera while on vacation in Thailand, and it seems to belong to a guy from Japan. He had a photo of his passport (so I know his name and that he's from Miyagi) and he's in a bunch of other photos. I'm not sure how I can find and get in touch with him so I can send him his camera (perhaps more importantly, a ton of vacation photos!) without breaking the cardinal rule of ***don't post personal information***.

Facebook/Google+/LinkedIn searches haven't turned up much.

Do you guys have any thoughts on how I could go about this, or is he totally out of luck?  ~~Below is a photo of who I believe is the camera's owner.~~ [photo removed now that this is resolved]

Thanks!


PS. checked with the mods in advance to make sure this post is OK.

**Edit**:  Thanks to everyone for all the suggestions and offers to help out!  I'm planning on calling the embassy here in the US today to see if they can help.  I have also emailed Tohoku Institute of Technology to see if they know him.

**UPDATE (8/7 1:15PM)**: Got a hold of the Consulate-General of Japan in San Fransisco and the woman I spoke to seemed to want to help out!  I gave her his name and passport number along with my contact info and she said she would see if the passport folks upstairs would be able to contact him.  I think I'll give them a few days.  If I don't hear anything back I'll PM some of those that offered their assistance to continue the search.  I'll keep updating as this unfolds.  Fingers crossed!

**UPDATE2 (8/7 1:35PM)**: Already got a call back from the same woman I spoke to.  Basically just confirming that she passed the info along and ""things are happening.""

**UPDATE3 (8/12 1PM)**:  Well, haven't heard anything from the Consulate so far.  Going to start sending some PMs out.

**UPDATE4 (8/14 5:50PM)**:  Success!  Just got off the phone with a guy at the Consulate in San Francisco and he found the owner.  I'm going to mail it to the consulate tomorrow and he will send it to the owner from there.

1342522154.0,122,self.japan,wp20x,Anyone over 50 should have a colonoscopy; want to hear what it’s like in Japan?,texasstorm,143,21,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/wp20x/anyone_over_50_should_have_a_colonoscopy_want_to/,"If you’re like me, you know you should get a colonoscopy, but put it off for years due to the natural tendency of people from our generation to keep foreign objects out of our buttholes.  (Based on r/gonewild, I realize this doesn’t apply to people under 30.)

The brief version is that it’s painless, not too embarrassing, and it takes most of a day. It cost me ¥6590 ($83) with my health insurance.

**If you want more details ...**


**Previous day**

Your last meal is before 9:00 p.m. and you are to avoid sweet potatoes, daikon radish, beans, gobou, raisins, cucumber, kiwi, wakame, negi, konyaku, spinach, tomatoes, watermelon, shiitake, and a few other things.

You drink a laxative at 9:00, which makes you go to the toilet several times during the course of the night.


**Day of the procedure**

1) Getting to the hospital is a bit stressful, since you are subject to sudden life or death missions to find a toilet. I suggest you have your route carefully planned out, with toilet locations noted in advance. I had a 50 minute commuter train ride; not fun. No food or coffee before the procedure either!

2) At the hospital, they take your blood pressure and force you to drink 1800 ml of another special laxative. Yes, that’s 1800 mls! You have 30 minutes. It tastes like sports drink, but it’s not a pleasant time. On the positive side, it’s all downhill from there.

3) After drinking it all, you’re free for about 4 hours! Make sure you’re close to a toilet, because it will be your home for a while. I chose a hospital close to my work, so I spent the time at my office, making multiple trips to the men’s room.

4) While you’re purging, you are supposed to note the appearance of your output. They give you a handy photo to compare your watery poop to the “ideal” watery poop that will, in theory, make the nurses squeal with admiration. [http://imgur.com/5HRcd](http://imgur.com/5HRcd)

5) At 2:00 p.m., I’m back at the hospital. They give you disposable paper shorts (dark blue) with a slit in the back, for easy access there, and a kind of paper tunic. This is great, because with all the nurses running around, you’re not standing there naked, but are fashionably posed in your paper tunic.

6) They give you an intravenous drip, because this is Japan, and they LOVE drips. Got a fever? No problem; have a drip. A couple of minor tests later, a few compliments on your Japanese ability, an intravenous painkiller, and the camera is up your butt before you know it! You can watch on the screen, just like Hank Hill’s family did in King of the Hill, Season 1.

7) The actual procedure only took about 20 minutes. You can’t feel anything, and you’re lying down, so it’s pretty comfortable. Afterwards, you rest for 30 minutes before you’re free to go.

**Update:** I found out at my consultation 3 days later that I actually fell asleep during the procedure! I had no idea. I thought the sedatives had no effect on me, and afterwards, I felt no unusual effects. Anyway, sorry if I gave everyone the impression that this was painless without sedatives. Rather, it's painless WITH sedatives, logically enough.

This may cost you $1500 in the U.S. Ha! I paid $83! Thank god for socialized medicine!

In all seriousness, I admired the efficient work and the professional, friendly staff at Ota Hospital near Kawasaki Station. Nice job! 

But I hope I never have to do it again.

So here's what I'm proposing! I will send you cash on sheer faith alone and you will go out and procure said lame Valentine's gift to hand deliver to the lucky sir tomorrow! I will also send you a note to print and put in the lame card that you will also need to go out and select.

Far fetched, last minute, I know. Any takers? :D


Edit - He's near Waseda station if that helps persuade anyone!

Edit - I fold! After a few promising messages, I just don't think I can pull this off sadly. Plus it's 5am and I need more sleep. Thanks for all of the love and well wishes though!

If you are American like I am, I am sure that you have no clue what to do with all of the vegetables and strange cuts of meat you see in the supermarkets here in Japan.  I swear I lived on tuna fish and pasta for months after I arrived in Japan.  My fiancé is a wonderful cook and our hobbie is cooking and having dinners so please join us.


If there is interest, We have room for about 6-10 people and live in the Yokohama area.  The most probable date will be in two weeks from now.




What I am not:
Not selling religion.
Not selling anything.
Not cool, not very young.
Not charging money for anything.
Not the couch surfer rapist guy from a couple of weeks ago.
One can never be sure about one's self but I don't think I am a weirdo.

What I want:
Meet some new people.
Have some laughs.
In some small way pay forward the kindness that was given to me when I first came to this country.


What is in it for you:
Learn some basic, cheap, and healthy meals that you can make on a daily basis. 
Meet some new people.
Have some laughs.
Free beer.

I'm getting tired of all this.  Not knowing when the blackouts will hit.  The constant earthquakes, keeping me awake all night.

I work for an ""international company"" and my colleagues are just up and returning to their countries.  I understand that they need to be safe and all that, but deep down I think they're cowards.  And they're causing me a shitload of extra work.

Others have been staying at my house when the trains go down because I don't like long commutes and can walk to the office.  Good people, but my place too damn small for fat people.  My boss commented on it yesterday.  Said it was ""the least I could do. "" How about some gratitude, you bastard.  The company pays for him to take a taxi home, but he never offered to share the ride with our stranded coworkers.

The international news is pissing me off royally.  Thanks for the nonstop disaster scenes and alarming headlines!  My mom back in the States is scared shitless.  I can't talk to her on the phone because she just puts me on edge and I don't have time for it.

I have to walk up 6 flights of stairs to ""save energy"" and all the stores are empty.  I'm craving pastries, food gets snatched up as soon as its put out.

I know things could be a hell of a lot worse.  I could have been further up north.  Hell, I've got friends from Libya and I can't even begin to imagine it.

This is starting to last too long, and it's weighing on me.  God, I can't wait until everything blows over and I can spend a weekend at a hot spring.

I have it now even though I was vaccinated normally in America. I don't know anyone else that has it, so I must have caught on my regular day to day routine. It is more mild that measles, but it's very dangerous for pregnant women as it causes birth defects and/or stillbirth in a fetus. 

Also, if anyone is planning on getting pregnant, They recommend  an antibody test to see if you are adequately protected from a previous vaccine, or if you needed a booster shot. (Ironically, I was waiting for the results when I developed it.) Also, it was recommended to avoid conception for 2-3 months after developing rubella or having the booster shot.

Somebody might have posted this news here, but searching the news in English, I couldn't find any while it's broadcasted in a few Japanese news. I'll try to post the summary because I thought it should be reported in English as foreign people have more chance to have Shinsei and Citibank accounts

[Here](http://www3.nhk.or.jp/news/html/20130202/k10015245761000.html)'s NHK news.

- Skimming machines (about 10 cm big; see how it works at 1:16-2:31 of the NHK news) were found installed by somebody at 5 Shinsei bank ATM in Saitama, Chiba and Tokyo and 1 Citibank ATM in Tokyo between October and December

- Information of 130 Shinsei customers has scanned and the cash amount of 6.4 million yen was withdrawn from 60 customers' banking account at an ATM in Cambodia

- no damage for Citibank this time, but there was another case, somebody withdrew 6 million yen from customers' banking account

- Tokyo PD think 10 Bulgarian men and women are to do with the case

- The group of people flew to Cambodia just after they collected the skimming machines (not sure if they have re-installed or just left it, or the 6 sites are all they installed)

- They also used camera (1:52) to read passwords 

- Shinsei bank is going to change some structures so any object, such as skimming machines or cameras, cannot be installed and is alerting their customers that they don't install cameras **on the side of** ATM as a general rule 「ＡＴＭの**側面には**原則として防犯カメラなどは設置していない」

----
- withdrawal by false bank card peaked in 2005, 778 cases with 819 million yen

- 2011 was 402 cases with 274 million yen ※increasing again recently

- bank companies alerts their customers to confirm there is surely no objects when you use ATM and to check their transaction record as some victims tend not to notice for a while",,False,,t5_2qh2u,1360007002.0,,,True,t3_17sslr,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/17sslr/atm_skimming_6_sites_in_greater_tokyo_5_shinsei/,

It certainly puts a lot of minds at ease to know there are people who care.

Edit 3: A few small changes have been made to this post at the suggestion of some commentors.


We thank you for taking the time to read this post.

It came down from the local Board of Education to us on February 1st, here in Fukuoka Prefecture. All ALT contracts in the public schools of Kitakyushu for the 2012 school year will only be from June to February. Also excluding pay in August. For 4 months there will be no stable employment for us.

We will soon be pressured by our dispatch companies and other employers to sign contracts for June right away. If we do this we will not be eligible for the unemployment insurance we have been paying into.

This is a trend that has been eroding working conditions since the economy took the downturn. If the local Board of Education can get away with this move, other city Boards may follow, threatening more people's livelihoods. There are a lot of scared people with spouses, families and lives they can not afford to simply drop.

We are asking for your suggestions and any information you can provide that will help us find a way to make this work. Even moral support is appreciated. Some people have already started a letter writing campaign to the city mayor and there is a lot of buzz going on to bring people together.

At the very least we hope you will spread the word about what is happening here.

Thank you.

For me:

1. Japan has an ID system for people with handicaps; if you get your handicap evaluated by a doctor, you could qualify for an ID explicitly stating the degree of your handicap, which can allow you certain benefits that make life much easier.

2. You can buy things easily online without a credit card: amazon.co.jp and rakuten.co.jp are excellent resources and generally allow you to pay at a convenience store or on delivery. You can order everything from wheat flour to couches to camera equipment. sofmap.com is a decent equivalent to Newegg.

It was great seeing a big group. There were even some people in their sixties and seventies from Osaka digging too (As one man  said ""You! Canada power! Me! 70-year-old power!"" ).

Managed to dig up a lot of garbage from a field in the afternoon. When the work was done the owner of the field gave a short speech saying thanks, and that because that has been done so quickly, he's be able to start rebuilding his greenhouses next week, and then work on replanting, and maybe have strawberries in time for when they sell them at Christmas (to a lot of applause).

Please remember, even if you don't donate or do volunteer work, you can support people up here by buying their fruits, vegetables, sake, and more. There are a lot of people working hard to re-establish their livelihoods, and that's something you can help with in your day-to-day life.

Seeing how people responded to such an overwhelmingly bad situation really helped me see humankind in a better light, and feel hopeful about what lies ahead. 

At the time I worked in the Miyagi prefectural office. We evacuated about 10 minutes after the quake (had to sweep the floor for injured or trapped people), and outside I watched the news on my cell phone. When I told a co-worker a 10 meter tsunami was forecasted, he laughed and said I must not be able to see the decimal point. His face when I showed him the screen was my first indication that this might not just be a normal major earthquake in Japan.  

As the prefectural office is the HQ for relief operations, I was close to seeing the center of the relief efforts; the Self Defense Force arrived about 15 minutes after the initial quake and set-up their headquarters in cooperation with the prefecture’s efforts. Being at the center also means I was getting a lot of raw data. On the floor above me the SDF set up a communications terminal with a monitor, and what I saw in the first few days was totally unimaginable. Coastlines with dead bodies (and parts of) floating out as far out as the camera could see, corpses scattered amongst debris in the middle of destroyed cities, familiar places where I’d gone to for festivals and to visit famous sites, places where I had friends. The only thing to over take this in my own personal “horrible” rating was when I went myself a week after to ID a body and a few times after that and saw it all for myself. Those are the memories that I find waiting on the nights when I can’t sleep.  

As days passed, these videos, combined with the news I was getting from a friend in the Crisis Management Division, as well as the more general TV news coverage (we got main power back just in time to see the first wave hitting Natori on live TV. Later on when they were showing stranded commuters in Tokyo I angrily questioned why they were focusing there and not on our area, and when they cut to video of Kesennuma burning, I really missed the commuters all a sudden) painted a picture that was hard to believe, despite being there: I mean, this was the sort of thing you saw on TV in a far away place, not where you live. I was there and it didn’t seem real.

Despite all of this, people kept working. The entire family of one person I worked with lived in Minami Sanriku, one of the worst hit towns. He only left to look for them after a full day had passed (and 24 hour shifts were arranged), and came back after the time he was given off ran out, before he was able to locate his mother (she died in the tsunami, but the rest of his family managed to evacuate). Him, and everyone else kept working and so did I. I’d be a liar if I said I wasn’t afraid; hell, it was May before I made it a full week without thinking I was going to die at any moment, but my job was to confirm the safety of people and assist them any way I can, and adrenaline’s a hell of a drug, so my coworkers and I just kept at it.

For the first week, sleeping in the lobby of the building (which became an impromptu evacuation center simply because the electricity stayed on) gave me a look at what it was like for the average person too, and it was also encouraging. The only real argument I saw was over shared use of cell phone chargers (they were one’s that some people had with them, and after the building’s maintenance staff requested that they share them, people did), but even this was resolved by making a reservation list on a scrap of cardboard from a box of blankets. I saw people leaving a food line to let a women with children get a share in their place, and I began to see that despite the awful situation, people weren’t going to stop being human. 

I watched with sun come up from the window of my office on March 12th (shining through the smoke of a massive refinery fire that was the only light outside the night before) and forced myself to think. This was obviously an undesirable situation, with the aftershocks, images of death and destruction, and now I was hearing about a nuclear plant in Fukushima some 100km south seemed to be out of control, I had to decide what I was going to do, stay or leave, even if just temporarily. It took all of one minute. There was no way in Hell (fire-caves version or the version I was in) I would leave, abandon friends and people closer than some family, desert my job at a time when it was especially needed, and turn my back on a place that was home to me after five years. I might have died in an aftershock, etc, but leaving would have killed me for sure.

Things were pretty much on a downhill slope for awhile. The number of deaths just kept skyrocketing, news from Fukushima got increasingly grim, and lack of food, gas and the like made basic living difficult. My co-workers and I made contact with more and more people, and some of them began to come into Sendai as a first step towards evacuating somewhere else in Japan or out of the country for a while. Of course there were no trains, and the airport was hit by the tsunami, so there were only buses. Gathering this sort of information and letting people know what was happening (there was no English news if you were stuck in the countryside with no electricity and internet) was also our job, and we did what we could.

All the little moments I witnessed could fill a book. Seeing an evacuated man and his wife building a divider (and shelves) from cardboard between their beds (and later entertaining guests with wine, I swear it's true), finding out that even if the tap water runs, it isn’t being purified so you shouldn’t drink it (I was pretty sick with the runs for 2 days), the feeling I had when the official death count exceeded the Kobe earthquake, seeing a convoy of trucks loaded with water and food pull up two hours after my friend in the Crisis Management Division told me that they were completely out of supplies for the coastal cites (I cheered, pumped a fist in the air and ran to help unload them, marking the only time (to date) I’ve made SDF soldiers laugh), meeting with embassy officials from five different countries and assisting them in finding their citizens, helping a neighborhood association make a fire pit to cook food for people, available for the low price of “help us if we need it” and a lot more.

But it’s the people that stick with me the most. People who held it together in the worst, people who’s homes had been attacked by an enemy that couldn’t be struck in return (I've jokingly said a few times that all the wreckage should just be pushed into the ocean, ‘cause that’ll learn Poseidon), and instead of being defeated by it, pushed and fought to win back their way of living. Not to mention the (at peak) 95,000 volunteers in Miyagi alone who came from all over the world to help, despite it being the definition of a “safety not guaranteed” situation. 

That’s the biggest reason I didn’t move after I finished my job in July: I’ve lived in Miyagi for five years, and I never knew how much of a home it was to me until all of this happened, how many of my friends went out of their way to make sure I was safe and had food to eat, and how much I wanted to…just fix it somehow. 

Given the scale of the disaster, I know it will be many years until Miyagi and Tohoku recovers to anything approaching what it was before 3/11, but while I can be here I intend to keep doing what I can when I can to help, because Miyagi deserves as much. I'd rather be here than anywhere else.           

I took [this picture](http://imgur.com/SEGt5) in Kesennuma yesterday. I smiled when I saw it, because despite it being construction to tear down wrecked buildings and try to restore the water front, they'll still apologize for any ""inconvenience"" it might cause.

Would never, in 100 years, happen in America!

Questions:
are those genuine offers, or just the right thing to say in Japan? Is it polite to accept? Is it polite to reject? Am I also expected to make over-the-top generous suggestions?

Do you leave before everyone else? Or do you stick around until the boss leaves? Do you refuse to make tea if you're a woman? Do people have different expectations of you? I'm especially curious about those of you in companies that aren't foreign-staff-oriented, like schools and such.

A friend of mine recently started as the only foreigner at a company, and he is struggling with how he fits in. We had a talk with a Japanese friend and longtime salaryman who is now in management. His take boiled down to: the company is like a village, it's not just a place to go and make money, but a place that becomes your hometown - you represent it, you should be proud of it and likewise do it proud, which is why everyone makes so many personal sacrifices. But when a foreign employee joins, people are unsure about whether to treat him as a villager or a visitor. They will look to his behavior for cues about which it is. So if you don't do the same kind of sacrifice and suffering for the company, that's actually okay and doesn't mean you aren't doing your job (that's the part that surprised me). But don't expect to be promoted to town council. On the other hand, if you do start acting like a villager, you can't go back; the same will continue to be expected of you indefinitely.

I'm curious about the views of people who have been down this path. Does this jive with your experience?

**EDIT** Thank you to everyone who tried to bring this to light with upvotes, and also giving feedback on how to clarify the content. My editing skills are crap and I was in a rush to give these people a voice because, as stated below Mixi isn't Gaijin friendly. **rachelrouge** has let me know that the BBC is bringing attention to Minami-soma, and so has NHK. 

Our work is done, if we even did anything at all, but thank you very much for taking this as seriously as I did.

Love and safety to everyone who is still in Japan.

***********************************************************************************

It is with enormously deep sadness I share these messages with you. I ask, no. BEG. You to upvote or forward this to any and everyone you know. I know it's against reddiquette but I'm asking anyway. My friend in Japan has been translating these messages for me to post. 
 
This is quoted by a desperate Japanese person on MIXI (Like facebook, for Japan) [USER YAMAUKI] trapped in the Evacuation zone near Dai-ichi No.1. 
 
The reason we want you to see this is so that you can hear the cries, suffering, pain, and fear that is afflicting these people trapped in Minami-soma, the 30 km fallout zone near Fukushima this very second.
 
With the fear of Nuclear fallout, Japanese people and rescue workers fear going into the zone to help.
 
Please spread the word - help them however you can. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
There is an unknown amount of people in Minami-soma who have been advised to stay indoors. There is a hospital (Omachi Hospital - http://www.ohmachi.jp/) trapped within the fallout zone that has 180 patients, being tirelessly nursed by 6 staff who are on the bring of physical and mental exhaustion after 7 days (since the quake).

Things are getting much much better in the area where I live.

We finally ran out of food, so I got up at 6 am, went to a shop nearby and waited for 3 hours.

Fortunately, I got enough food which will probably last more than a week.

 

What we still really need is gasoline.

There is no bus service available around his hometown, so we can't go and see his parents by bus. Needless to say, trains are dead.   But we know emergency vehicles are on the front burner, so Hideaki decided to be patient. It's so painful to see him worrying about them like crazy but he can't visit them.

 

Hide and I don't consider ourselves as victims aynmore.

We don't buy too much food. We save on electricity and water.

 

And I don't really care about the Fukushima nuclear plant, to be honest.  I just care about people in Fukushima.

It's nonsense to worry too much about it because I doubt the radiation leak from the reactors harm our health.

Lot's of experts have been working hard! I believe in the professionals working on it. I hope people not in fukushima don't get freaked out by it... I'll eat food from fukushima and I'm not scared of visiting there.   I really hope Fukushima will not be hit hard by rumors.  

 

Thank you very much for trying to send me something. Everytime you asked me if there was something I need, I was moved to the point of tears. Thank you..Thank you.

 

Japan Post is partly in service in sendai city , like they started to deliver letters and small stuff, but no packages.

I'm afraid no couriers are available right now.. It means a lot to me you offered though!

 

.. I want to ask you a huge favor.

If you  have money to send me something,  can you donate the money to poeple who lost their homes and loved ones?

Thanks to the local people, rescue workers,  and support teams from other prefectures and countries,  they started to be able to eat properly and drink gradually.  but they'll need financial aid soon.   I know some of you have already donated money. That's enormously helpful.   I'll donate money and resorces to them too.

 

I have food. I have lights and water.  I have tons of warmth from my dear friends.

I don't need anything else. 

 

Don't worry about me,  I'm not in any trouble!

Please take care, my friends.  Be safe.

 

 

I hope I can visit you and say ""thank you"" to you in person someday.

 

Arigato!

He's the type that'll wear dark denim jeans over sandals. He greets onlookers softly from under his corduroy cap.


He's a gentle man. Perhaps a man with no family. Perhaps a man with too much time on his hands. But he has one thing that he shares with the rest of us, and it's a basket full of furball felines.


With great care, each and every cat he has wears a handmade name tag. On each tag is a name written in a perfect mixture of hirgana and colored marker. Each cat is carefully placed throughout the two platforms of a baby stroller, and he walks like this, a circus of cute and absurd, through the crowded-yet-sometimes-empty streets of Tenmonkan.


Women and men alike flock to his sideshow of pedigree fluff and sleepy yawns. The onlookers squeal like school children full of delight as they frantically pull out their cellphones to snap photos of this rare, but welcome, sight.


Outside of the confines of the stroller, sometimes found perched on the man's shoulder, sometimes found cooling in the entrance of an air conditioned store, is this man's first and best mannered friend: Maron.


Maron is not your typical cat. Maron is bushy, whiskery, and sleepy. Groomed with care, and brushed to a puff, Maron is a four paw show that requires no entourage.


When the man in the dark denim jeans calls her, she comes immediately. She follows directions and knows, to her core, that she's the star. Not just the star of the show, *his* star. His best friend.


He loves all of his friends, I'm sure, but Maron is different. Maron is his best. Maron is his pride.


* * *


Not too long ago, I was walking through the streets of Tenmonkan. I noticed the cat man standing more silently to the side, more detached, than I'm used to, and it was then that it dawned on me: I hadn't actually seen him in quite awhile.



I approached him and listened to him speak words so soft they floated away on the wind like little puffs of smoke, vanishing out of thought. Maron was gone, he said, and looked down as if to maybe find her there once again by his leg.


He explained that he had traveled to Fukuoka, and while walking through the streets, he noticed he was missing someone. Maron. He said he stayed in Fukuoka as long as his money would allow, but he eventually had to come home.

After a few minutes I could hear the express train approaching (which doesn't stop at my station).  The train blasted its horn several times which is quite unusual.   It was approaching from my right side and I could hear a woman yell to my left.  I looked over and saw an older guy (probably about 65) slowly walking towards the edge of the platform towards the track.   He had distanced himself from the majority of the passengers.  There was no way the express train was going to be able to stop and I was convinced that he was going to jump at any second.  Then out of nowhere a younger Japanese guy came up behind him, grabbed him by the collar and yanked him back.   It caused quite a scene (obviously) and the old guy seemed to be crying.   The guy who grabbed him shouted for the staff who quickly ran down towards him.      

Hopefully things get better for him, but I'm convinced that younger guy saved his life.  ",,False,,t5_2qh2u,1366116791.0,,,True,t3_1cgh15,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1cgh15/saw_a_guy_nearly_jump_in_front_of_a_train_today/,

I welcome all friendly debate.)

Recently I have noticed more and more links to [japanCRUSH](http://www.japancrush.com/) being posted, as well as hearing of some of my colleagues taking part in translation for the site. For those of you who don’t know, japanCRUSH is the newest part of a network of websites concerning mainly East Asian news stories, with a particular focus on translating comments of native bloggers and message board users into English. The original and most popular of these sites was chinaSMACK, where one could access the previously untapped source of opinion of Chinese netizens. It was a huge hit with Western expats in China. Then followed koreaBANG, indoBOOM, russiaSLAM, and now japanCRUSH - using the same formula of translating native netizens’ comments into English for all to read.

Here’s the problem. This website is utter garbage. The stories are pure sensationalist drivel, usually concerning foreign relations, or expats in the country in question “misbehaving” in some way. Then under the story will be the translated comments of a bunch of internet yahoos, usually cherry picked from right wing boards, reacting angrily, cursing foreigners and wishing deportation/punishment/death upon them. The final stage is the comment section of smack/bang/crush itself, involving defensive expats battling with English speaking trolls, usually about sleeping with native women.

http://www.koreabang.com/tag/foreigners

http://www.chinasmack.com/tag/foreigners

I think the Korean one is by far the worst, as the comments section has been invaded by affiliates of the Anti-English Spectrum (racist Korean males angry about white English teachers “stealing their women”) Here you will find a horrendous cesspool of hate and ignorance.

So to sum up their business model: post a bunch of inflammatory stories and inflammatory comments, goad outraged expats and outraged natives flock to the comments section to duke it out, and watch the page views go up. The Gawker network would be proud. On chinaSMACK they also regularly feature a series on “European-Chinese couples”, which serves a dual purpose: anger the racists, and promote their other business venture, [a dating service.](http://personals.chinasmack.com/member/home.jhtml?puid=3819060)

Now japanCRUSH is still very young, but considering the popularity of Japanese culture on the internet, and the completely skewed way the webmasters wish to portray these countries, I think it has the potential to become very big, and damage relations between foreigners and Japanese people. Online at least. If I had never visited Korea before, based on what I have read on koreaBANG, I would assume it was a racist hell hole where I might get lynched for holding hands with a Korean girl. Some poor soul might think the same thing about this country and think twice about coming here, or feel further stress in living here. This blogger said it better than I did.

http://eastasiastudent.net/china/problem-with-chinasmack/

Finally, please remember that a bunch of cherry picked comments from 2chan does not equal the opinion of the Japanese people. So unless you love online drama, avoid, or take it with a pinch of salt.

**TL;DR: japanCRUSH is part of a network that posts negative, sensationalist shite. View at your own risk.**

I don't even know if this is the right subreddit. It's kind of a self-confession/sad-post, related to Japan. So, I hope you all are open to hearing me out. Thank you in advance. 

I've always been very interested in Japan, its language, and culture. When I was a kid, my parents hosted University students from Japan. I fell in love with the language, certain aspects of the culture, etc. 

I majored in Japanese, and then graduated, came to Japan (teaching English). I would say that was my first mistake.  I should have gotten some certification (i.e., JLPT) before just trying to find *something,* anything, and jet over here. After working two years as an underpaid ALT, I just can't do this anymore. I've been waking up at 4am, studying from 4:30am to 6:30am, rushing to get ready for work, working from 8am to 5pm, then collapsing in bed soon after. I took, and failed, the N2. I was going to take it again this July, but I looked at what I've studied so far, and I'm not gonna pass. I just haven't consumed and retained enough grammar, vocabulary, or kanji. 

So, I am sharing. I'm sharing the death of my dream. Of becoming proficient in Japanese, and doing something with it, in Japan. But I feel like I could have stayed in the U.S. and advanced my career. Hell, started a career by now. As we all know, teaching English in Japan is mostly a joke (outside of the respectable people who teach because they love it, and are professionals). I've been a fool these past two years. I really, really tried. I tried to become proficient. But due to my own lack of stamina, and my intellectual limitations, I just couldn't. 

I feel like I've wasted nearly 10 years of my life on a language that I couldn't master. To all of you out there that did, I want to say that I admire you. You deserve to feel proud of your accomplishments. 

Thank you for reading this post. Even if I'm just some internet stranger, it means a lot to me. ",,False,,t5_2qh2u,False,,,True,t3_1fgleb,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1fgleb/just_couldnt_do_it/,

1336913973.0,77,self.japan,tkwm9,Help me understand the battle over Narita airport,eriotto,93,16,68,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/tkwm9/help_me_understand_the_battle_over_narita_airport/,"As far as I can tell, everything about Narita has been a nightmare for everyone involved for the last 50 years, and I'm trying to understand. There doesn't seem to be much good English information on the internet about it. Are there people on here who are familiar with the history? Here's as much as I can piece together:


1. Early 60s, the government wants a new airport but has very few options for where to put it. They choose the area of Chiba where the airport is now because the Imperial family has a large piece of land they're willing to part with, but it's not enough; the government would still have to convince a number of local landowners, mostly farmers, to sell. They announce an opening date of 1971. They dismiss concerns about its distance from central Tokyo by promising a shinkansen line. This would also require obtaining a lot of land.


2. Many of the locals don't want to sell their land. And they *really* don't want to sell. Letters are sent, protest marches are held, and eventually violence is perpetrated against surveyors and inspectors who come to the site to start planning construction. Things are tense throughout the rest of the 1960s. But it's not just the locals; there are a lot of larger groups involved, who offer manpower to the locals in their struggle.


3. The airport's scheduled opening date of 1971 comes and goes but the government hasn't been able to get the landowners to sell. They decide to appropriate it anyway, which is legal but very unpopular. Locals (and others?) do everything they can to scare off anyone involved in working on the airport. Thousands of police stand guard. Riots happen. People are killed. Construction is delayed for years.


4. Finally, the airport opens in 1978 with only one of its planned 5 runways (opening is delayed after the control tower is invaded and wrecked). The remaining runways and the shinkansen line would require more land seizure and the government is hesitant to go through the same thing again so it gives up on the shinkansen (which is why ~~it still takes over an hour to get to Narita from Tokyo~~ it took over an hour to get from Tokyo to Narita until last year) and limps along with plans for runway 2, which is completed in 2002 with a [funny curve](http://www.47news.jp/CN/200907/CN2009072601000400.html) in the taxiway to avoid the protester's land. To this day, there are only 2 runways, and you still have to go through a security check (or at least show your passport) before you can even enter the terminal building due to fears of terrorism that pre-date 9/11.


5. [Violent protest continues](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJoFM8ynyMQ&amp;t=2m05s) as late as 1985 (!). But the people in that video are old. And though security is still high, there are fewer and fewer protesters at the airport these days. They removed one of the protesters' buildings in 2009 and only 30 people showed up. So the movement seems to be dying out, but there are still enough bits and pieces of private land around the airport to keep it forever incomplete and hard to get to.


I hope I have the facts right. So here are my two questions:

1 - Wikipedia identifies the groups who protested against the airport as ""socialist"". Why would socialists fight for the right of private citizens to keep private land that would benefit the nation economically if it were used as an airport?

2 - What's with the people who have held onto the land near the airport? As the original owners have died off, have their kids sold the land, taken the money and run? Can the government, in effect, wait for a generation of people to die because it will still be around and they won't?

Cant lie and say there is no overtime :P But I have had the chance to learn a lot here, and the people are quite nice.  We are a company of about 100, and have 6 foreigners at our office including me.

Mobile development experience is a huge plus.  (Android and iPhone) as well as knowledge of Unity.  Japanese language skills are not required but of course helpful.  You can PM me for specific details or if you want me to forward a resume.

They will sponsor your visa as well.  Must reside in Japan though.

Sorry if this is a strange post...but thought Id see if any fellow Redditors were interested.  You guys have been really helpful.

EDIT: Thanks for all the replies and PMs.  I'll try to get to all of them after work today.  A lot of you mentioned not current residing in Japan but I think it would be a bit difficult to work out since we get a lot of applicants inside Japan on job sites.  Regardless I will talk to my boss.  Thanks!

It's been over two weeks, and no word has come about my friend's location. This situation is very worrisome.

Monty was at Rikuzentakata when the earthquake and tsunami hit. He called his fiancee, Naoko, when the earthquake hit. He was in one of two locations: the city hall or the civic center. Apparently, the names for those buildings interchange, so if he told Naoko that he was at the civic center, he could have been at the city hall. Only one of those buildings were left standing.

There has been conflicting information about his post-tsunami whereabouts. Some people *may* have seen him, but they're not really sure when it was. Some people were evacuated and made it to safety, and he may have been with them. If he was in a building that was hit, those people have not been heard from, either. 

Naoko biked to Rikuzentakata, and went to where his apartment was. There was nothing left. She is confident that he will be found alive, but despite my initial optimism, I am not sure if I can believe it anymore.

I can't emphasize how heartbreaking this is. Monty has been a very prevalent person within our department at the university, and Anchorage being a relatively-small town, he was a guy that a lot of our friends and mutual friends knew. He's genuinely one of the greatest, sweetest, most compassionate people I know. He deserved this great opportunity to work in Japan after working his ass off for years to get there. He was orphaned as a teenager, and that only further amplified his ambitions to make his parents proud. No one deserves to die in that manner, but his family deserves to know what happened.

I'm again asking for Redditors to pass along his information. [Here](http://japan.person-finder.appspot.com/view?id=japan.person-finder.appspot.com%2Fperson.2704239&amp;lang=en&amp;query=Monty+dickson&amp;role=seek) is his missing person's page with information and photographs.

Now for the big question. Redditors in Japan, what is communication like? How hard is it to get to those towns that have been ravaged? Do you think there is any chance there are many survivors, that just have yet been able to contact their families? His family can only do so much, contacting various officials and consulates. Those people, in turn, can only do so much in Japan when the sat phones go down and traveling is difficult. It's been so long, and so hard to not have any news, good or bad, come from Takata..

1) When you cancel your service you must be physically present at a Softbank store to do so. (There is one at Narita). And your service will be cut immediately. You can not set a future date to end your service.

2) You must pay a ¥9,975 fee to cancel outside any period besides between 2 years and 2 years-2 months (and increments of 2 years) of your contract start date. Even though we bought our phones ~3 years ago.

3) Final payment can be done with a credit card or paper bill. Additionally the credit card must be the same name as the account holder. Since we closed our bank accounts in Japan and my wife has a different last name in the states than Japan she was unable to use any american credit card for this and I was not able to use my card because I was not the ""primary"" account holder.

Finally the softbank people at Narita are assholes. Probably the worst customer service experience I had in Japan. We didn't give them a hard time about the cancellation fee or anything, they just had a terrible attitude like we were inconveniencing them by trying to close and settle the account.",,False,,t5_2qh2u,False,,,True,t3_1k0pul,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1k0pul/psa_on_canceling_softbank_contract_when_leaving/,

As with any group of foreigners, the topic of conversation steered towards things about Japan that we don't like so much. One of the teachers there mentioned something about residence tax. Another guy who was there said something along the lines of ""That's bullshit. I can't own land or vote. I'm not a resident of Japan. I'm just not gonna pay it."" ...and everyone was just like ""yeah, cool man"".

..Seriously? First of all, it's my understand that foreigners *can* purchase property. Second, *yes of course you fucking are a resident of Japan!* You physically reside here (you absolutely *do* live here! Where do you sleep every night?), work, and collect a paycheck in this country. You are absolutely a resident and have lived here long enough that you have to start chipping in for the road your drive your car on and the sidewalk you use to go jogging among other things (or whatever the government claims to use the money for).

I get it - paying taxes, rent and health insurance on a teacher's salary after living in Japan for a couple of years can stretch the monthly budget a bit thin, and I'm as cheap as they come in most areas of my life, but goddamnit, can we not be freeloaders?",,False,,t5_2qh2u,False,,,True,t3_1iou3o,http://www.reddit.com/r/japan/comments/1iou3o/rant_foreigners_not_paying_taxes/,
