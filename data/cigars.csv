1367692866.0,400,self.cigars,1douzt,Start brainstorming now... we get to build our own samplers. Please make the arrow orange rather than blue.,SecretAgentMang,490,90,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1douzt/start_brainstorming_now_we_get_to_build_our_own/,"There isn't quite a cigar sampler online that really draws my attention.  Of course there exists samplers that have great sticks, but they always have to drag their 'special' cousin (ex. Gurkha, 5 Vegas, etc.) into the mix. 

That's not to say that we haven't had opportunities in the past to develop samplers from companies... but that always ends up non-satisfactory as the company rarely has the vitolas or even the brands we want to include. Of course taste is subjective and there isn't one sampler to rule them all, but there has to be a combination of cigars that the majority of us can agree upon that is absolutely fantastic - yet at this point a sampler of that caliber hasn't been achieved.

Insanemo and I were discussing this issue with the owner of Casa de Montecristo, and how there is nary a company that can produce samplers that we want.  

**He proposed an idea.**

""Talk to the members of your community and see what cigars they want in the sampler - make as many samplers as you would like.  We will put it together at a discounted price, put it on our online storefront, and give you a free shipping coupon as well.""

I think we are going to take you up on that offer Sam...

----

Insanemo and I discussed possibilities, and I believe that we are going to develop three samplers.  

**Sampler 1 - The Beginner Sampler**
---

This will be a sampler that will include a rainbow of different cigars - flavors/sizes/etc. - and will be a learning tool for those who want to start smoking cigars or want to have a better understanding of what is available on the market to them.  When they ask, ""I am a *complete* noob, what should I smoke?"", we can suggest the beginner sampler.  On top of that we can include some literature so they can learn about the cigar and the profile, while they smoke it.

**Sampler 2 - Anything Goes (5)**
---

Any cigar that Casa de Montecristo carries is fair game (and trust me, they have the goods).  Ideally this will be for those that want to step outside of their comfort zone and try some truly fantastic cigars.  Since this sampler will have 5 sticks, we can include some HTF cigars that Sam keeps in stock.  

**Sampler 3 - Anything Goes (10)**
---

Same deal - any cigar we want, but this time with 10 cigars.  I would prefer we push towards a more budget friendly sampler.  This doesn't mean that we won't have the pick of the litter, but we don't (and shouldn't) just fill the sampler with Ligas, Opus X's, and Padron 26/64's - high price doesn't necessarily mean superb flavor and quality.

-----

As this progresses there will always be more room for samplers.  What I need you to do now is **brainstorm some cigars you would like to see in these samplers below**.  Make sure you signify which cigar you want in which sampler, and tell us why you want it there. 

You don't need to list out the entire sampler either - if there is one cigar or a few you would like to see in one of the samplers, that is more than okay.

But make sure you tell us why it belongs in the sampler.

**Remember:** We can make samplers out of all of CdM's hard to find collection, but we want to make sure the sampler is affordable to our younger-aged community.

**I will be reposting next week so we can finalize details.**

----

As for what is available - like I said, they have a ton of different cigars.  If you want a better idea of their collection, [**visit their online shop.**](http://topqualitycigars.com/)

----

Just to preemptively quell any possible suspicions - Insanemo and I are regular customers of Casa de Montecristo and we host a lot of herfs there (like the upcoming [**September Meetup**](http://redd.it/1d1gjt)).  What we don't do is profit from doing any of this.  Sam appreciates our business and wants us to be able to create samplers with his product. Simple as that.

Everyone needs to know that. After I discussed with him offering a r/cigars discount, he jumped on board with the idea, and has spent the past four days working to make this happen. 
That said, the discount is now live, and here are the details in all their glory:
After analyzing their inventory, they were able to include 5,254 unique items, or 68.7% of the cigars on their website in this offer. Also when you look at the “not qualified” list, (Viaje, Ligas, any General or Altadis products, etc) featured in the link below, you’ll see a whole bunch of discount/bargain type brands that you’ve most likely never heard of before, and it’ll be obvious that they were able to include the vast majority of “the good stuff”. The final discount is going to be 17% off the selected items, and free UPS Ground shipping will be given to orders with $60 or more worth of qualified cigars in the cart (after the discount has been applied). 
Accessories as a rule are not eligible for the discount, but all Xikar cutters and cigar lighters will qualify for the deal. 

Below is the list of what does not qualify, as well as a short message explaining the process from /u/humanash. 
Get excited guys! This is really going to save us some money!

I don't know the exact details yet, and I don't know what the minimum order would need to be (or how that works at all), but we have a serious opportunity of getting our own r/cigars Xikar cutters.

**If you are interested, upvote this thread.** (It will give me a rough idea whether this idea is good or bad)

If you have any comments/concerns/questions, leave them below.

If this goes through and you want to be that special somebody who designed the cutter itself... you can either post your design below or PM me the design. Assume the design will be placed on a [X1-X3 chassis](http://www.aficionado-a-havanas.com/images/xidetail.jpg). Later on we can vote on designs.  (for the design please leave out the reddit alien logo and the word 'Reddit' for legal reasons.  '/r/cigars' is allowed.)

edit: [Here is another Xikar rep expressing interest](https://twitter.com/XikarSWRep/status/226528560209330176).  This was after he asked what design we would use.

edit 2: Insanemo is going to look into having Reddit to allow us to use 'Reddit' and/or the Reddit Alien.

edit 3: We are more likely to get the x1-x3 customized as of now.  It also seems to be the more popular choice of cutter, so let us focus on those.  Also, I don't know what the price will be but assume the regular price of a Xikar.  It may be a few bucks more, or a few bucks less.  


edit 4: Wow!  Front page of /r/cigars!  

edit 5:  This is now the no. 1 link in the history of /r/cigars.  This better go through.

edit 6: As I further research Xikar, it will probably be on a [Xi2 Chassis](http://xikar.com/products/cutters/xi2/).  Now Xikar has the product priced at 39.99 but I hope to stay at the price, and even possibly get a discounted price.  Stay tuned.

edit 7: Keep getting intel that Reddit demands profit on items with 'Reddit' and Snoo the Alien.  The designs can't have these.  Keep that in mind when creating your design.

**edit 8: Privately speaking with Xikar Reps.  Will create new thread when I make some headway.**",,False,self,t5_2r090,1344469098.0,,,True,t3_x0jn0,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/x0jn0/how_would_everyone_feel_about_a_rcigars_custom/,

To me, cigar smoking is to be a relaxing experience. Imagery of assault weapons and hip hop lyrics, at least for me do not conjure up a relaxing atmosphere. It comes off as very ""tough guy"" and too gimmicky. If Guy Fierrie were a cigar, he'd be the MUWAT (I also hate the acronym.)
The size. I dislike large ring gauge cigars. In my experience they burn terribly. In the 5 pack of 6 x 60, EVERY ONE needed constant touch ups. Again, I want to relax, not baby sit my smoke. The taste. If youre going to produce a cigar that is going to take me 2+ hours to finish, please dont make it as one-dimensional as this. It was the same flavor, start to finish.

AmateurDebater walks amongst us, and has committed a serious violation of trust. 

Got assigned AmateurDebater as a trade partner, in order to help him get verified.  This was six months ago.  We trade; his sticks arrive promptly.  A few I've never heard of; kind of look like yard 'gars.  I shake it off, smile, toss them in my humidor.  Forget about them. 

This week, I head to Vegas with a group of buddies.  Toss one of AmateurDebater's chump sticks into my travel humidor; don't care if it gets banged around a bit since it's some rando smoke I've never heard of.  

Check in at the M Hotel.  Pour myself a whiskey.  Know I only have 20 minutes before meet my crew for dinner, but want a smoke.  Take out AmateurDebater's chump stick.  Light it.  Love it.  Look around quizzically.  Keep smoking it.  It keeps getting better.   Refuse to put it out and carry it into elevator to go downstairs to dinner.  I'm loving this cigar.  Band starts to warm up.  Slips off. 

Second band underneath. 

Bolivar.  Havana.  

World comes crashing in.  All sound stops.  Ringing in my ears.  Camera spins around my head in slow motion.  Kaiser Soze moment.  My first Cuban. 

AmateurDebater, you are a gentleman and a scholar.  I underestimated you.  I never will again.  

tl;dr - AmateurDebater slipped me a Cuban in our trade 6 months ago without my knowing; is a goddam American hero. ",,False,self,t5_2r090,1345917621.0,,,True,t3_yt59o,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/yt59o/important_information_regarding_community_member/,

We did an automatic import and translation of your old wiki page a few months ago, but the results may not be perfect and there may've been edits on the old system since then so the new system is disabled by default.

1333463261.0,202,self.cigars,rr760,[Mod update] - Regarding shipping cuban cigars to the USA,deelowe,240,38,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/rr760/mod_update_regarding_shipping_cuban_cigars_to_the/,"Some of you may have noticed that discussions and posts regarding sources which ship cuban cigars to the US have been getting removed by the mods. Just as a reminder, shipping cuban cigars to the US is illegal under US law due to the embargo. As such, we have decided that we will remove posts and comments that discuss such activities on this site (we don't want to deal with the authorities, sorry). I enjoy a good cuban cigar like most anyone else here, but we can not allow these discussions to take place here due to the liability it presents to the community.

**TL;DR - Please do not post or discuss US sources for Cuban cigars here. If you do, it's likely the discussion will be removed.**

**[EDIT] Please upvote this so others will see. Remember, self posts get no karma.**

**[EDIT] To be clear, I did not say people can not discuss cubans, post pics of cubans, or discuss non-us sources. Nor was there any mention of people getting banned. Also, as I said in the comments, things have always been this way (go through the history and you'll see where things have been getting removed). I just wanted to make sure it was clear as to why.**

----

**[EDIT]** OK, since there appears to be a lot of confusion around this policy and armchair quarterbacking about why this is a logical decision, maybe I can help clear things up a bit. To be perfectly honest, there are a ton of things being discussed that I really don't care about. This includes you doing things in your free time that might land you in trouble with the authorities. I'll miss hanging out with some of you guys, but other than that, you're free to do whatever you'd like. It's really no concern of mine. Please, feel free to go buy cubans and smoke them by the truckload if you want. Post pics, talk about how great they are, post videos. We really... don't... care... Just please refrain from publicly asking where you can buy them, discussing how you got them, soliciting other members for them, or advertising that you can get them. Why? Because, it creates all kinds of headaches for me (and the other mods). We just don't feel like dealing with the tattletales, the mods &amp; members at other sites, the freshmen in college who call themselves lawyers, the pissed of domestic reps &amp; retailers, or the people who wine about getting screwed over ordering from what they thought was a ""reputable source."" Sorry, it's just too much work to deal with. How do I know this is or will become an issue? Because, this was been an issue at nearly every other cigar forum in existence.

I'm sorry if this seems heavy handed. It's really just a simple request and this rule existed prior to me becoming a mod, so it's nothing new. Finally, it's not like posts and comments were getting removed every day anyways. We've had like 1 instance in the past month that I know of. I just don't like doing things without telling you guys. I hope everyone understands why it has to be this way.

Please upvote for visibility.,SecretAgentMang,228,24,71,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/19ni1v/the_art_of_the_its_purpose_and_what_the_community/,"Currently, there is a love/hate relationship with our current trade system.  Besides regular monthly trades, needing a [+] to participate in certain contests, giveaways, and events seems silly, but there is a method to our madness.

I want to take a little time to explain the purpose of our trade verification system, why I created it 2 years ago, and what we expect from you.

Beyond the belief that obtaining a [+] gives entry to some sort of /r/Cigars secret club, our current system was created to establish a barrier meant to fend off scammers, bad traders, and thieves.  Having earned your [+], it is now established that you have completed a trade, and in all likelihood, you will maintain your integrity in future trades.  In reality, the [+] is a sign of comfort and trust for traders in this community, and it reinforces this trust when they send cigar packages valued between $5 and $200 (and sometimes higher).  Having a plus shows that you have proven that you can successfully package and trade cigars. 
 
Don't expect the community to put their trust in you right away after receiving a [+]. It takes time and multiple successful trades paired with community interaction for the community to ultimately give you their faith.


---

**Once you receive your [+], there are unwritten courtesies that the community expects you to reside by.**

Time in and time out we witness the same rude behavior in trades.

Taking advantage of someone earning their plus.
---

Helping someone earn their plus isn't an opportunity to unload cigars you don't like, or bum sticks hoping that you will receive something better in return. Just last week I saw someone openly admit in a trade that they trade the bad stuff they receive in [+] trades and keep the good stuff for themselves. Not cool.  The verification trades should be treated as a learning experience. Send a variety of sticks for what is most likely a newer smoker to try.  This is also a time to instruct and guide a new trader on preferable shipping and packaging methods. Be a mentor, and in return we will establish the best trading system online.

Not shipping within at least a week of the agreed upon shipping time.
---

A week gives a solid amount of time for anyone to ship.  For those busy during the week, it gives you the weekend to ship.  While the week is a fair time limit, common courtesy suggests that you should ship as soon as possible after the trade is established.

Not alerting your trade partner if something comes up.
---

Life happens. Everyone understands that. What makes the difference of a good and bad trader, is if you alert your trade partner to why a package will be shipping late. We understand that there are extreme circumstances in which gaining access to a computer to send a message to someone in this community is the last thing on your mind. Take care of what you need to take care of, and get in touch with your partner soon after.

Committing to trades when there is even a slight chance something might come up.
---

If there is a big event, whether it be good or bad in the foreseeable future, do not commit to trades.  Committing to a trade should never be seen as risk or gamble if something is going on in your life. There will always be cigars to trade. Take your time and come back to the trading scene when everything is in order.

Not packaging your cigars correctly.
---

This one is a no-brainer. Cigars are fragile, treat them as such. Do not ship them in an envelope; they will get crushed. Do not ship them without some sort of sealed bag; they will dry out. Use some sort of padding in the box you use; they will bang around and get damaged. Treat the cigars in a way that you would want your trade partner to treat what he is sending you.  I made the mistake of shipping three packages a while back without some sort of boveda pack, or water-pillow. The three packages got held up at USPS for over a week, which may have caused damage to the cigars I shipped. I have learned from that experience and now ship all cigars with some sort of humidification method.

---

If you have any questions or suggestions, please post them below, and I will do my best to address them.  

Thanks for reading,

SAM

This might be a useful tool for contests, giveaways, AotM, etc. in which voting influence isn't affected by current score.

Let me know what your thoughts are below, and depending on conversation we will decide how to implement this new feature.  

**Thanks!**

**Edit:** Admins on voting behavior:

&gt; Voting still behaves normally, and behavior of the page will not otherwise be affected (best/top sorting will still use the scores, comments with score less than the user's threshold will be collapsed, etc.), but the comment's actual score will not be visible until it is at least that many minutes old.",,False,self,t5_2r090,1367270761.0,,,True,t3_1dd41g,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1dd41g/new_feature_the_community_needs_to_decide_on/,moderator

The amount of time /r/Cigars has been patient as we have worked towards a finished product.  [When we began brainstorming](http://redd.it/x0jn0) this project on July 23rd, the amount of excitement shown towards the idea was overwhelming.

We want to thank long-time /r/Cigars member slackwaresupport, a Xikar account holder, for hosting the sale of the Custom Xi1 Cutter through [CKCigarshop.com](http://www.ckcigarshop.com/).

Between then and now, we held two design contests. [Apost8n8](http://www.reddit.com/user/apost8n8) selflessly requested that we extend the contest to allow for more entries; an act proving he was a rare BOTL who puts community in front of his own desires.

The second design contest was won by [lw421](http://www.reddit.com/user/lw421). 

**Today we get to unveil this beauty that he designed, and we are beginning preorders immediately.**

/u/humanash actually works for them, so he stepped up and clarified how it worked. I responded to him and asked him if he would be willing to give a discount to r/cigars members, to which he graciously said he would in the paragraph below:


Fortunately for us, I'm the only one that would need to approve that type of offer, and I think it's a great idea! There's a couple different ways we could go about it, I'll let you and anyone else who wants chime in to see what would be preferred. I could do a small discount across the board, say in the 5% area off everything we carry. Alternatively, I could offer a more substantial discount, say like 15-20% off plus free shipping on what would amount to approximately 70% of our cigar inventory, but would leave out the other 30% of the cigars and all the pipes/pipe tobacco. The cigar selection would be pretty darn good, would include the majority of our most popular brands. Basically, it would exclude all General products and most Altadis product, along with a small number of other lesser-known brands and the rare/ltd ed stuff like Opus, Viaje, Liga etc. Let me know what you guys prefer and I'll get the ball rolling.


Okay, so after reading that, our options are 5% storewide, or something to the tune of about 20% off plus free shipping for most things, leaving out only some of the limited edition or hard to find stuff plus General Cigar products. 

Which would you guys prefer?
I'll post comments of the two options, and upvote the option that you would rather have.

(please upvote for maximum visibility),SecretAgentMang,187,31,162,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/13xpsw/proposed_updates_rcigars_guidelines_please_upvote/,"The mods and I have been working on updating our guidelines for the past few days but instead of posting them and calling it a day, we want community feedback so we can make these the best guidelines possible.

The reason for guideline changes and updates was that we didn't feel the existing guidelines were clear enough and there was a lot of content that was left uncovered.  Too many posts sat in a gray area and it was hard for us to determine whether some things were truly spam or not.

Although we are not as recognized as BOTL, PUFF, or Herfer's Paradise, we are the fastest growing cigar community with roughly 50 subscriptions a day. While fourth in size now, it isn't impossible to believe that we will one day be the largest community in the world (at the current growth rate).

Because of this, we are going to receive a lot more spam, troll, and junk posts, and we as mods not only need to be able to determine what to remove, but we want the community to help as well.

**So our goals for these new guidelines:**

- A one-stop post for all members to see what they can and can't do.

- To give the mods the ability to remove spam, trolls, and prohibited content without an arguable 'gray area' present.

- Rules for Site and Company owners so /r/Cigars isn't taken advantage of.  *These rules also show that they can post within reason.*

So please read through and provide feedback.  Thanks!

Not once has a member of this community **started** a cigar company.

Enter Jim, *aka /u/kilrpenguin*, the founder of the new **Chicagoland Cigar Company** (CCC).

[*Jim (on the right) at his booth before Big Burn Chicago opened up for the evening.*](http://i.imgur.com/XDkiNFE.png)

Jim now seeks help to establish his company via indiegogo (similar to kickstarter).  Before I link this fundraiser, I ask that you read everything below to understand why I am posting this here, and for you to learn more about one of our very own's entry into the industry.

----

**His History as I Know It**
----

I've had the opportunity to discuss CCC with Jim countless times since the first time we met back in October.

Jim has a family of entrepreneurs  - simple as that.  As entrepreneurs, they wanted Jim to challenge himself with something new.  That something new was an idea to roll cigars at events such as weddings.  Jim spent some time in Texas training with master cigar rollers, and since then has been perfecting his technique.

At some point between the time he started rolling and now, Jim has been to multiple tobacco leaf events, and has decided that there exists a formula of tobacco that will create a new and flavorful cigar (multiple in fact).

So begins CCC.

----

**Why should we help?**
----  

While I don't review cigars, I am a critic in my own fashion.  I have been and continue to be honest to a fault, and have the luxury to do so since I don't have to worry about pissing off any site advertisers nor do I receive any free product.  The ability to be openly honest without worry opens up a new dimension of conversation that rarely takes place (*I ain't afraid of no ghosts*).  

So instead of discussing cigar band designs and other *froofy* stuff with Jim, I challenged his decision to start a cigar company.  With my limited experience on how 'boutique' companies begin, run, and survive, I berated him - question after question until I was satisfied with his answers.  Every time we visited at the local lounge I quizzed him with taxes, crop consistency, production speed, distribution, and his blends in general. I'll give it to him, every question had a good answer.  What I appreciated the most was his openness to accept criticism/suggestions from anyone who gave it.  The best leaders are fantastic listeners.

My remaining skepticism was thwarted when I attended Big Burn Chicago - the first sponsored cigar event in the Chicago area.  While there were quite a few big name companies being represented at the event, the Chicagoland Cigar Company booth consistently had the most people gathered around.  Not a single person at that event had heard of this company, yet so many people were attracted to it...

Despite my best efforts, I can't not like Jim.  It would be easy if he was a prick, but here is a guy who would give the clothes off his back if someone needed them.  

It's because of this I have taken time to vouch for him.  Not because I am being paid, not because I owe Jim in any way, and not because there is any free product in it for me - but because **I want to**.

**Ultimately, it's your decision.**

----


**The Cigars**
----

- **The Draco**


- **The Swashbuckler**

Both of these blend recipes are a secret to me.  I am waiting to hear back from Jim about the description of each cigar, and I will update this portion of the post soon after.


----

**And finally, the support**
----

The incentive's for support are pretty good (*i.e. $75 get's you 10 of each blend*), so take a look at Jim's video and his fundraiser at the link below.

Thanks for taking a look.  Feel free to ask questions and Jim will jump on at some point to answer them.

""That's what we have a sidebar for..."" or someone asks for help identifying a cigar and they get ""yup, that's a cigar"". Now don't her me wrong, I'm all for busting some balls, but I wonder if we aren't maybe driving some people away with answers like this, who could end up being great members of the community.

----

**What is a Build'A'Humidor Giveaway?**
----

Essentially, you send in cigars, and in return you receive entries. These cigars will be collected by us, and after the giveaway is over, we will randomly select four winners to receive four awesome prizes - a pseudo-lottery. 

During the entirety of the event, there will be a Google Drive document that is updated every Saturday with cigars, entries, and the individual who sent them in.  Each Saturday, we will have a post featuring the best packages sent in.

At the end of the event, we will have a lottery drawing utilizing **www.Random.Org** and we will pick four winners.

---


**Prizes**
----

**4th Place**: 5% of all the cigars that are sent in

**3rd Place**: 10% of all the cigars that are sent in

**2nd Place**: A desktop humidor, a box of Herrera Esteli's, and 35% of all the cigars that are sent in

**1st Place**: A Romeo y Julieta humidor, a box of Drew Estate Liga Privada T52s, a standup Liga Stinky Ashtray, and 50% of all the cigars that are sent in

----

**Cigars as Entries**
----


There will be a possibility of receiving 15 entries. You will be able to send in a maximum of five cigars, and the entries are determined by cigar MSRP.

- $5-$10 cigars will be worth 1 entry

- $11 and up cigars will be worth 2 entries

- Anything that we determine to be very special/rare will be an additional entry. (We will determine if it is special/rare when you submit your entry)

To gauge MSRP, use Google to search for your cigar (and appropriate vitola aka cigar size/shape) and look for MSRP.  If you can't find MSRP, submit your request and we will find it for you.

**For those who are not able to participate and send in cigars:**

We are discussing a potential third way of entering which would be receiving entries by chipping into the final shipping pot.  It will cost a pretty penny to ship out all the prizes and we might need help!  This option will be revealed later on.

**What isn't allowed?**

- Cubans (we love Cubans as much as the next guy, but for safety/legal reasons, these cigars will not be permitted for entry)

- Infused (we do not have a separate humidor for infused cigars so they will not be permitted for entry)

- Gurkha (the MSRP on these cigars are ridiculous, and will not be permitted for entry)

- Unbanded cigars.  Your cigar must have a band on it.


----

**TO ENTER**
----

**Send a message to /u/BuildAHumi with the cigars you are entering.**  (Every message received will be responded to, but the messages will be checked once an evening.  Please be patient in waiting for response, thanks!)

Example:

&gt; *Title: Build'A'Humi Entries*

&gt; - *Joya de Nicaragua CyB Lancero*

&gt; - *Tatuaje Little Monsters 'The Mummy'*

&gt; - *Illusione Epernay*

&gt; - *2012 Oliva V Belicoso*

&gt; - *Padron 2000*

In response you will be notified with:

- If there are any cigars in your list not permitted

- How many entries you will be receiving

- A shipping address to send to

Once you receive the go ahead, send the cigars and you will be entered!!!

(For those who have sent in their list previously, please resubmit to /u/BuildAHumi)

----

**Shipping**
----

It is very important that your shipping method keeps the cigars intact.  Anything that arrives in bad shape will not be counted as an entry, so take your time giving the packaging some TLC.  There are a lot of shipping pros on /r/Cigars, but we will leave a few tips for new shippers.

- USPS Small Flat Rate boxes are free and easy to use (**[within the US it is $5.15 to ship if you 'click n print' on USPS's website](https://cns.usps.com/go)**)

- Place cigars in a sealed plastic bag (you do not need a humidity element if you do this correctly)

- Pad the inside of the box with anything to cushion the bag of the cigars

- On a piece of paper, include your shipping address with your cigars

- **[Here are some other great shipping tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1byzx2/water_pillows_have_a_reputation_for_leaking_and/)** from /u/z6joker9

We will be allowing non-US members to join but they will need to cover any additional shipping expenses

----

**Rules and Considerations**
----

We are going to be as fair as humanly possible and to do so we will lay out the rules for everyone to see.  Nothing surprising below, and if you have any questions, please ask below!

- Must be 18 or older (or legal smoking age in your location to participate)

- For non [+] members, participating in this giveaway (w/ successful packaging) will earn you a [+]

- While you are free to send cigars from your humidor, purchasing online and having the company ship direct is an option

- We will only allow one package per address

- The moderators of this subreddit are not liable for anything

- Any broken, mistreated, damaged, moldy, beetle-infested and dry cigars will be disregarded and not used for entry

- /r/Cigars moderators are not permitted to enter

- Any cigar that is less than $5 MSRP will not count as an entry

- Each prize is worth 1/1,000,000th of a penny

- We will not pay the return fee for any cigars that are not permissible to the above standards

I finally had the opportunity to smoke one, so after checking where I could smoke with the hotel, I went down to the lava beach behind the hotel with an Ashton VSG at sunset.

I didn't bring a lighter with me (TSA regulations), so I had got some matches at a B&amp;M. I sat down on the rocks near the water, and attempted to light the VSG.

It took eight matches to get one that would stay lit, but I thought I was home free when I got one that caught; I blame both bad matches and the omnipresent Hawaiian wind (give my shattered ego a break). I got the cigar about half-lit when the match went out. No problem, I thought. I'll light another.

This did not occur. As I desperately tried to light another match and keep the cigar from going out, it began to canoe. By the time I looked up from my fruitless attempts to get another match lit, the cigar had not burned on one end, but had burned for almost three inches on another.

I had been constantly puffing on the cigar this whole time, and I had inhaled a good deal of smoke by accident, and my tastebuds were pretty fried. I was dizzy, I couldn't taste the cigar, and the sun had gone down. With a heavy heart, I gave up.

This was when I realized that something was crawling over my legs. Crabs had come out of the rocks in the dark, and were climbing up on my pants and shirt. I jumped up, flinging crabs everywhere in the dark, cursing and yelling. A couple clung steadfastly to me, and I continued to yell as I tried to knock them off of me.

I fell on my ass, and I scrambled off of the rocks and back onto dry land. Bleeding from the lava rocks and crabs, I stumbled directly into the flashlight beam of two hotel security guards, who had been dispatched because a guest called the front desk complaining of a strange man smoking a substance while yelling curses and flapping his arms around. The guards let me go, with a warning not to disturb the guests.

TL;DR: Messed up an Ashton VSG, inhaled half of it, attacked by crabs, mistaken for a crackhead/tweaker.",,False,self,t5_2r090,False,,,True,t3_qxic7,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/qxic7/i_had_a_hilariously_bad_cigar_experience_today/,

It has been brought to the moderators attention that some verified members are siging up to help new guys earn their +, but are not sending cigars to their trade partners in return.  Let me make this clear:  **This is NOT acceptable**.  This makes /r/cigars look like a bunch of guys that like to steal from people, which is unacceptable.  

**Verified Members**:  If you are unable to trade correctly, do not sign up to assist members in earning their +.  The minimum is 1 cigar per trade.  If you are not able to do that, please be up front about it.  Nobody is going to judge you...We understand that everyone is financially able to trade or afford cigars for trading.


**UNVERIFIED Members**:  If you send a trade out and do not hear back from your trade partner within 2-3 weeks, please, PLEASE message the /r/cigars moderators ASAP.  It's hard to track someone down and remind them that they have to fufill a trade from 3-4 months prior to you notifying the mods.

To the people that are having trade problems, I apologize.  People who are not sending their ends of the trades are getting their +'s taken away, and the mods are discussing other solutions to make /r/cigars a better place.  Don't be discouraged if you feel you have been duped.  The mods will try to do everything possible to get your member to send you your cigars.  If they do not respond after 3-4 weeks, I will send you some cigars personally so you will not be out of cigars.

The people have spoken and the top 5 cigars of /r/cigars are:

**Non-Cuban**

1. Liga Privada #9

2. Drew Estate Undercrown

3. Padron 1964

4. Three-way tie: Liga Privada T52, Padron 1964 Maduro, Olivia V

5. AF Opus X

**Cuban**

1. Montecristo #2

2. Cohiba Siglo Series

3. Partagas Serie D #4

4. Cohiba Esplendido 

5. Montecristo #4

Note that the Cohiba ""The La Línea Clásica Series"", which is your standard Cohibas (Esplendido, Robusto, etc.), if combined, would rank 4th.

Also, Survey monkey would only let me see the first 100 responses, so I am very sorry to the last 26 people to do theirs. I would include you if I could, but survey monkey won't let me :(

This way I should have enough time to set up matches and in turn beg for verified members to help out.  Any member willing to help out more than one b/sotl would be amazing and can have all my internet points.

I will post a reminder on the day prior to the matching to hopefully drum up some more peeps to help out.

For the (and I emphasize) *most part*, has been welcoming to new people and answering the questions they may have. 

Here's the thing about that: I've begun to see an influx of rude and unhelpful comments to these new users. Which is sad. As for an example, about a month ago, someone posted about a machine made cigar they were gifted and wanted to know what it was. I hopped in on the comments section only to see things like ""yep, that's a cigar"" or ""only good to roll blunts with"". Comments that did NOT answer this persons questions. 

That kind of struck a nerve with me. We've all been there once, be it a Black and Mild or Swisher Sweet, we all started somewhere and we were totally clueless at one point too. Is this how you would want your questions answered? I'd sure as shit hope not. What are we, five? 

As for my second gripe, which I find rather annoying (however some people here may disagree) is the ""adding of context"" to posts. Now, I know nothing I say here will change anything, but there's one kind of ""context"" that I feel shouldn't be in a post. And that would be of a link to a review posted on here written by one of us. For me, I have no issues whatsoever leaving a quick blurb about what I talk about in the comments for a video review, because I know some people may not want to watch and/or can't for other reasons. No problemo here. 

The thing that gets me is this: RobbyRasReviews posted a great review earlier. I read it on his site and got some great info (thanks for that, Rob, excellent write up). I looked in the comments and saw he had posted THE ENTIRE REVIEW IN THE COMMENTS. That wasn't needed. There is no point. But, as a person posting here, I think he felt like ""he had to"" because of the stipulation of the context-rich posting guidelines. For a review he wrote on his site. Seriously? Is this what we're coming to? For me, I don't think anyone who WRITES an entire review for their site should post the text of that review in the comments.

As for picture posts with some context, carry on. It helps start a conversation.

Since I knew almost nothing about cigars or TC at the time, I thought it would be a good idea. 
I was wrong. 
Shortly after signing up for their 250 club in May, I get a phone call telling me about their club and ""deals"". I soon learn during the phone call that there are many problems with their ""deals"" and club. I tell them that I do not whatsoever want to make continual payments every 5-6 weeks and receive cigars every month or so. I distinctly remember the man I was speaking to saying that all orders were cancelled. I even spoke to a lady after that who tried to sell me on their ""cigar tour deal"". I said no, and she confirmed that I will be receiving no cigars. I was okay with that. 

At the end of June, I got my paycheck. I gave a sigh of relief and all was well. The next day, I get a package in the mail. I have no idea what this is considering I just got my paycheck and I didn't order anything. I open it up and it is an order from Thompson Cigar. It is their ""Cigar Tour deal"". Five(mediocre)cigars for $29.50. At this point, I'm really confused as to why I received this when I know I cancelled everything to do with them. I check my bank account, and another freaking $67.45 has been taking out from TC. At this point, I'm really..uhh..upset. Yeah, let's go with that. The next day I get the other package of cigars, a 16-count sampler. I call them after the weekend is over because customer service isn't open during then(who does that?)and after waiting over 10 minutes on hold, I finally get to speak to someone. After a very long discussion and many holds later, I finally am told I am getting a complete refund and that they are sending the return postage in the mail. I am told that I can use one box to send both orders back. 

15 days later, I check my bank account and FINALLY..finally there is money back from TC..but only $52.45. 
..what? I call them and fortunately I do not have to wait so long to talk to someone. I ask why I only received that amount back and after waiting back and forth on hold, they finally tell me that they only received the 16 sampler back and not the cigar tour sampler. That would be impossible considering I sent both in one box. I do the math and even if that were true, I would be getting $59.95 back with the return shipping costs added, not $52.45. I sent it back in one box with one return postage, it should be $7.50 taken off, not $14. They go talk to the manager. They say they have to look in the warehouse and that they will call me back tomorrow. Tomorrow. Wow. 

All that to say..don't support them at all. With anything. They are a bad company who lie and steal. I'm so pissed off right now.

Details inside...,El-Diablo-Blanco,154,26,163,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/xexw9/okay_boys_we_are_on_the_rcigars_custom_cigar_from/,"HAHAHAHAHA YES! I worked this thing over the weekend and boy do we have a treat for all you herfers out there. Before I go into a few of the details, I wanted to address something. For all those Lancero fans out there I saw your requests. We went another way on this one, but don't worry, **El Diablo Blanco** *does not* *disappoint*. We will make something special for you, and it will be *phenomenal*. In the meantime we're giving away a box of lanceros every two weeks until the end of the year starting today: *[DETAILS](http://on.fb.me/N7uGGR)*

But now, the main attraction. After hours on the phone with Nestor Jr., working out the logistics with my supply chain, and explaining to my team what the hell a [Snoo](http://imgur.com/r/til/e9gOX) is we've come up with something we all think is pretty great.

We are going to do a **[Salomon](http://en.cigar-wiki.com/Shapes#Salomon)**! This is a size we've never done before, and it's a risk, but we think this is a big deal and we wanted a big cigar to commemorate this inaugural run. Sticks will be 6-3/4""x54, and crate-aged for 90 days. This is premium leaf here boys. We're talking *top notch* Estilo Cubano blend. This is by far our most popular blend with tobacco from Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and it just got a **90** rating in Cigar Aficionado.

We should have pricing worked out by the end of the week and hopefully pre-sale orders too if I can get the powers that be to sign off on this deal. The price will be attractive, so stay tuned...

Lastly, we need **your** help. Many people tossed out ideas for both band designs and for the name. This gave my guys an idea: why not let /r/cigars name it and design the band? So, going against my better judgement, here's the pitch:

* Think you're a decent graphic designer? Excellent. **Email us**(socialmedia at kretek.com) with your contact information. **Don't** send any comps quite yet, but we'll bring you in on the details. You have to get us your information by **12:01am on August 4, 2012** for consideration. Put ""/r/cigar Band"" in the subject line and include your name, phone number, where in the world you live, and an email.

* Not an artist? You majored in English, you say? Submit your best idea for a name. We want to name it after something the community recognizes so keep it Reddit-y. Keep in mind we can't name it after Reddit or Snoo the Alien but pretty much every thing else is open for discussion. Post the name *below*. One name per submission, please and multiple submissions are fine. If you can't think of a creative name, **upvote** the ones you like. The top vote-getters will move on to the next round. 

Good Luck to all and Much Love from Ventura Cigar!",,False,self,t5_2r090,False,,,True,t3_xexw9,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/xexw9/okay_boys_we_are_on_the_rcigars_custom_cigar_from/,

If your match hasn't posted their gift yet, or you have sent me proof of shipment, **I need proof of shipment ASAP.**

If I do not receive proof of shipment and your match does not receive their gift, the mods will assume that you didn't ship anything. Standard procedure is to remove your [+], prevent all future trades with your account, and add your name and address to the [Scumbag List](http://scumbagslist.com/) for the entire cigar world to see.  

**We really really REALLY don't want to do that.**  If you aren't going to ship a package you are better off messaging me then trying to get away with it.  We can come to a resolution.


ALSO, if you have received a package **you MUST POST IT**. We are having a giveaway and we want everyone to have a chance.

I sit here, sipping on a glass of the finest Yellow Tail Merlot on a late Wednesday night, puffing away like an idiot on a Brickhouse (remember those?), reflecting over the last 2 months since I have returned to moderating this subreddit.  I think even further to when I initially joined, the community that was, and the conversation surrounding it.  Between then and now, I became a moderator with DosFool, and shortly after we brought on Deelowe (we miss them both, and no they are not dead, just busy).  We have made many changes and additions since then; trades, verification system, B&amp;M database, some fantastic CigarBid tools (thanks sloppy and cleric!), and location flair (and many more I haven't the patience to mention!).  We have also inspired great things from our members; contests big and small, herfs across the world, and brotherly/sisterly acts that have kept us all human.


Since our inception 3 years ago, and our true beginnings when ISmokeCigars took over from eampire early last year, we have grown over 6500 members, and now average about 32 members a day.  Based on trends and the magic of statistics, by this Christmas, we will almost double our current members, reaching a little over 11,000 members, if not significantly more.


**What does this mean?**


It means that we are going to get many new aficionados (everyone is an aficionado at their own level), and with that, excited ladies and gentlemen who want to take time to share their cigar experiences.  This is a subreddit which motto reads **Of, or relating to, the business of cigars**.  Is has not changed since I have followed this subreddit, nor will it in the future.  


We are not a small corner of reddit.com anymore.  Not only are we being noticed more and more throughout reddit, but our name is now being murmured throughout the cigar industry as well.  I am not just talking about Jonathan Drew and those that work for him, but different companies, review websites, and cigar CEO's themselves.  Is this a good thing?  Time will tell.  Just like you, I do not want r/cigars to turn into free ad space for these companies, nor will I let that happen with the help of the other mods (and your responsible use of the *report* button).  At the same time, this opens up a lot of opportunity for the reason we came here in the first place: cigars.  Special r/cigar blending sessions are in the works, and we are already seeing reddit only deals, first initiated by John of Savinelli.  When something like this forum grows this fast, people are going to notice.


I came back to this subreddit two months ago very naive and cocky, and posted my [goals for this subreddit](http://redd.it/spluu).  I was under the impression that this subreddit had failed, and I was completely incorrect.  In my own mind, I wanted things to go back the way they used to, pre-1000 members, when IRC chats used to be chats in this subreddit, and where the legends (old guys) started their beginnings here. As reviewers, ZacktheStogieMan, xxReckonerxx, travelingstogie, elninodiablo, and many more have done amazing things and will continue to do so because of their love, knowledge, and respect for cigars (even if you love or hate them).  I want the old subreddit back, but I know I can't have it, nor can any of you have it, **but I believe it will get better**. 


That being said, we are better than making a complaint about it every week.  This complaining isn't fair to the old guys who have spent so much time putting their knowledge into this subreddit, and at the same time to those new members who just want to see how things are done, share their experiences, and perhaps their years of cigar knowledge.  Above all, I am calling myself out as moderator for this one.


There are going to be posts we don't like, and that is the way of life.  If it is cigar related, it stays (not including spam and obvious troll posts).  If you want to throw a picture up without worrying about having to write anything about it, by all means.  I can't promise that members will get upset and downvote it, but that is how reddit works.  Find your karma elsewhere because you probably won't find much here. Slackwaresupport has created [r/cigarimages](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigarimages/) where you can post pictures without fear of being criticized.  I could only hope that you wouldn't criticize anyone in r/cigars, and it bums me out that there was a wanting for a split.  Things happen.  No hard feelings.  I have already found myself looking at some of the pictures (tim0k takes the sexiest pictures).


I am sorry for the long read, and thank you to those who stuck with it up to this point.  I have talked a lot about the beginnings of this subreddit and where we might be going in the future.  The future isn't up to the moderators, it is up to the community, just as our current well-being is up to all of you; **the aficionado's that have built this amazing community**.


To those that think I am breathing hot air without display of change; I have asked the moderators to step back a few feet and let the community decide how things are going to be ran; through your tolerance and actions.  The mods will continue to direct traffic, and make sure everything runs smoothly.  Remember though that the moderators do have their opinions and will always be active in conversation (whether you like it or not sucka!).  


What I ask of you is to be open minded, and if you see something that you don't like, consider hiding it.  Don't let an image or link ruin your r/cigars experience.  Think a little longer before creating a post or comment on 'what makes you mad' or 'I have a problem with this'.  Be patient with 'how did I do posts'.  Not everyone who joins goes into our history and finds discussions like these. **Be polite**.  Treat this like a real cigar lounge.  I wouldn't walk up to ebypic and spit in his face for silly reasons (unless he talked about my mother).  Talk to the IRC guys, they are great (and provide the best and worst nsfw links).  Get in a Google+ chat.  Talk to other members before you throw something in 6500+ aficionados' faces.


**Above all, smoke the god damn cigars you love.**


With many many thanks,

**THE CAUSE**

/r/cigars and the Leaf and Flame cigar team are gathering the troops to host the biggest cigar raffle in which all proceeds go towards the Movember Campaign.  With special donations from Drew Estate, Xikar, and members of both the Reddit Cigar Forum and Leaf and Flame Cigar Forum, we have over $2000 of cigars and accessories that we will be raffling off to support Men’s Health.

A few weeks ago the idea was born to create a raffle to raise funds for [The Movember Campaign](http://www.movember.com/); a group that grew mustaches for the month of November to raise funds and awareness for men’s health issues primarily prostate and testicular cancer. Movember focuses on spending the maximum amount of funds on men’s health initiatives and using minimal funds for fundraising and administration. Their total administration cost is 2.1% and fundraising costs are 7.9%.

The majority of the funds collected by Movember are donated to foundations such as the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the LIVESTRONG Foundation.

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 20 and 34, testicular cancer is one of the most treatable forms of cancer with cure rates nearing 100% if detected early. Most cases of testicular cancer are found by men themselves when doing a self-examination or by accident. It is important to regularly examine your testicles: men who routinely examine themselves become familiar with how their testicles feel; any changes should be checked by a doctor, preferably a urologist.  For those unfamiliar with how to perform a self-exam check out MANEXAM, and watch this self-examination video.

R/CIGARS very own custom cigar. The presale is ON NOW: http://bit.ly/r-cigars-PLUS-salomon

We've called in a few favors to get this to happen but we are glad we did. This is going to be epic.

First things first, **the name**. As voted on by the community and as reviewed by the 6,000 lawyers up in this joint, we are going with  **[+]**. We think it's a fitting name and it embodies r/cigars' culture of trading.

So, to encourage trading we are going to sell them as a 2-pack (one to smoke, one to trade) in a sleeve. Boxes of cigars can be a bit much to purchase for some community members and we wanted to keep it within reach for as many community members as possible.

Now, on to the big questions:

**What's it going to cost?** 
For two salomons in a sleeve it's only $10 +S&amp;H of $4.99 (be sure to select USPS Priority Shipping, you won't get them any faster if you select a different shipping method). These are large cigars @ 6-3/4""x54. Big deal, Big cigars.

**When will they be available?**
These are custom cigars hand-rolled and crate aged especially for r/cigars. In other words, if you think they'll be available next week, you're gonna have a bad time. Expect delivery around Mid-December.

**What about the Band Design Contest? Is that still happening?**
Yes, we are still going to do that. Those who tossed their hat in the ring will get their instructions via email today. If you're interested and didn't get chance to make a request, you can hit us up here: socialmedia at kretek.com and put ""/r/cigars band contest"" in the subject line and include your name, where you live, and a phone number where you can be reached. Tonight at Midnight PST is the deadline for sign ups.

**Where can I buy them?**
2Guys out of New Hampshire is taking orders here starting TODAY: http://bit.ly/r-cigars-PLUS-salomon

Thanks to the community, a **BIG** shout out to the MODS, especially MattyBlayze. I really hope this thing goes well so we can do more down the road.

I mean, they also stole my car, both of our keys, wife's purses, my wallet, etc. Take my cars, but not my cigars! LOL.

Once again, please upvote for visibility. 

I just got off the phone with Ariel Santos, who is going to be our account manager at CI. He is very excited to work with us and was impressed by our ""little"" community here.

Here's the lowdown:

He can't really match the fantastic deal that pipesandcigars.com is offering us, but he still would like to help us out. 

We would become one of the accounts he manages, which means that at the very least we will receive weekly private deals from CI and special offers occasionally. 

He is also going to try to get us an introductory sampler. This sampler would be exclusive to us, and it would be in the build-your-own format. We need to pick out the cigars that we would like to see in this sampler, more details on that below. This would be extraordinarily marked down, i.e. 20 sticks for $60.

We need to work on a list of brands that I can email him in the next few days. These brands would not only comprise the sticks in the sampler, but also brands we will could see further deals on. 

/u/isaidnothanks had a great idea in requesting the brands that appear on the list of restrictions that pipesandcigars.com can't get us deals on.  I think we could build on that list and remove cigars that there is no interest in, i.e. Dale Earnhardt Jr, White Owl cigarillos, etc. 

Please comment with any concerns, questions, or ideas. 

I have commented the list of cigars, and I think it would be pretty efficient if you guys replied to that comment with the cigars you would or would not like to include. Keep the replies simplistic, for cigars you want to add please say +(brand) and ones you would like to remove as -(brand) and we will let the up and downvote system show more generalized opinions. 

I expect to have this finalized by Sunday, so any input will be valuable.

So, as ya'll can see I'm giving away hundreds of dollars worth of stuff, all out of my own private stock and donated by some amazing supporters. So, how do you win? Well, that's the easy part.

[*****Click This!*****](http://theovernight.donordrive.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=8402)

Every $5 donated will equal one entry. In the ""Message to Fundraiser"" field you **MUST** put in: ""/r/cigars Username"" (example: /r/cigars SchwartzBR)

The drawing will be held live on Google+ on June 8th using random.org to select the winners.
**FREE SHIPPING TO US/APO**

Canadians or other - if you win something, you will need to cover the cost of shipping/duty/tax/etc. 


As I'm sure y'all can tell I'm really just throwing this together without a ton of detailed planning, so if I'm missing something obvious PLEASE let me know so that I can edit.

I'll be posting finalized prizes including pictures this evening. 

Please spread the word on this, and let's make some solid donations for a great cause. I don't want to have given away a few hundred bucks for like $25 in donations. 

 **NOTE:** If you're not registered in reddit and still want to enter, just put your e-mail address in the Message to Fundraiser field with the word ""cigars"" somewhere else in the field so that I can find you.

1350395658.0,112,self.cigars,11kikg,Introducing Leaf and Flame,SecretAgentMang,148,36,125,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/11kikg/introducing_leaf_and_flame/,"Leaf and Flame is a new cigar forum, built with great features, created by members of the r/cigars community including Speedgeek, Bitaemo, Justif, TheMcg and myself.  In a discussion early September, a group of r/Cigars members and I discussed how we could improve this community.  After a lot of arguing, we determined that what we ultimately wanted to be, couldn't be done on r/Cigars.  We feel that we are very limited in our growth, even though we are the fastest growing cigar forum in existence.  While I am not asking you to agree with what we are doing, I believe that you will enjoy what Leaf and Flame has to offer, with the 250 r/Cigars members that have already joined.

Keeping discussion and knowledge at eye level was our biggest goal for Leaf and Flame.  While we do have some great discussions on r/Cigars, those posts disappear within 1-2 days. With the new format and the community members we love, we can keep discussions ongoing.  Even when posts start to pile up, we have incorporated an advanced search feature with a tagging system.  I myself am still getting used to the new discussion style, but we are experimenting with different ways to discuss within threads.

Trading is different on Leaf and Flame, but we feel that it will be great, especially for those that are looking for specific cigars.  Like most forums, there is an ISO (in search of) and LTB (looking to buy) area. I posted an ISO for a Tatuaje Old Man and the C and within 12 hours had a trade set up with Justforrazors. Instead of using a [+] verification system we have an eBay style rating system.  Once a trade/purchase is completed you are encouraged to rate your trader/buyer/seller.  The rating system is public, so you will be able to see who has good ratings, and who has bad ratings.  

Another new feature includes the greater ability to have discussions with members of the cigar industry.  We already have members of Alec Bradley, Xikar, Drew Estate, Halfwheel, Tampa Sweethearts, and AVO on the forum, with more to come.  For those who are uninterested in industry reps using forums for advertisement, posts like those will be limited to a section called 'Retailer Specials' and 'Industry News'.  We have been working hard on getting more companies involved in Leaf and Flame, with a goal of being one of the most informed, well-rounded communities online.  A wiki is in the works and will be community developed.  Eventually we are hoping that this will be a wiki that can be used as a cigar knowledge resource for the entire cigar industry.

As we continue to build, change, and grow, we will continue to make it the best cigar forum we can, based on what the community wants.  So when you get a moment head over to www.leafandflame.com.  If you like what you see and want to help mold the forum into something great, create an account.  If not, no worries!  We aren't trying to fracture the community, but to provide an alternative way to have discussion and interact with all aspects of the cigar world. Speedgeek, Bitaemo, and I will continue to remain active and develop r/Cigars just as much as we do Leaf and Flame.

Always remember to smoke the god damn cigars you love,

SecretAgentMang

Please ask any questions you have below and I will do my best to answer them as soon as possible.


----


Edit 1: No ads or incoming revenue on the site, we built it with donations from r/cigars members.

Edit 2: If you are going to troll this post, use your real account.

Edit 3: So as we speak I am getting troll downvoted and commented on by someone who as issues with the site.  That's fine, I figured as much.  I just wanted to state again that we didn't build Leaf and Flame as a 'screw off' to r/cigars, we did it with the community in mind.  I will be happy to discuss the site even if commentary is negative, but as I have removed trolls since I have been a mod, I will continue to remove trolls now. 

Edit 4: If any of you are concerned, I won't be talking about this site on r/cigars from now on... I just wanted to let you guys know about it, see if you liked it.  Carry on!

Edit 5: Interesting, it appears I have received my first threat.  Somebody has serious rage issues.

**EDIT 6: Thanks to all those who checked out the site today, we have had about 60 new subscribers from r/cigars.  Check later tonight for a giveaway on the site. (Hint: for security issues, anyone who wants to participate will need at least 10 posts).**

1 Undercrown

1 5 Vegas Classic

1 5 Vegas 'A' AAA

1 Sancho Panza

1 La Estrella Cubana

45 cigars.  Unreal.  I wasn't expecting anything like this at all, and when I saw the size of the package on my porch and then the contents inside, I couldn't believe it.  Whoever you are, my Secret Santa, I think I love you.  

Seriously though, thank you so so so much.  There is so much here I can't wait to try.  I can honestly say I've only had two or three of the sticks that were sent, and they were all different vitolas.  My humidors are packed and I'm going to have to pick up a tupperware tomorrow morning for the rest of these bad boys.

It has been a number of months since I have posted on the Forum.

While I have not posted during these 3 months, I just want you to know that I still keep up with much of what is going on and I look forward to returning after we complete some of the projects that we are working on, including the construction of the Factory Expansion in Esteli, Nicaragua and a major Military Support Program for our American Warriors throughout the world.

As many of you know, I am a solid supporter of Reddit and believe that the site offers a tremendous benefit to premium cigar smokers in knowledge and camaraderie.  Please burn a Nicaraguan stick, whether DE or any other company, and think good thoughts of all of us in Nicaragua who continue the tradition of manufacturing premium cigars and committed to the culture.  All of us in Nicaragua love your passion.

God Bless each and every one of you.  Please always continue to help each other and continue spreading all the blessings of empathy and compassion to everyone in your circumference.  ""They"" say that cigar smokers are bad people and all sorts of other lies.  Politicos in Washington try to use this play to gain votes and control power by creating regulation after regulation - spreading the ethos of ""do what I say, not what I do"".  

The task that we are charged with, of beating this evil self rightouesness is not an easy one.  With your continued support, we have a chance to defend our passion and culture.  My business partner, Marvin Samel has moved to DC to help in this fight.  Most of the major premium cigar companies, as well as most of the boutique companies have also done an amazing job in this battle.  

Thank you, Reddit, for so many of your personal contributions and efforts in this fight.  It will never be forgotten.

Very best,

Not only is it nasty the day of but I find it's almost at the worst when I wake up the morning after.

I've tried tongue scraping, mouth wash, mouth wash &amp; brush &amp; floss, various kinds of food.  The best I've been able to achieve is masking the odours for a few hours at best.

After significant research into what actually causes cigar breath (pyridines primarily along with pyrazines) I stumbled across an activated mouth wash called Smart Mouth.  

It's not a cheap product, but I figured at this point I had tried a number of other things without success what's a few more wasted dollars.  

The setup:  Smoke 2 cigars in succession in the evening.  Brush teeth, use Smart Mouth, shower and hit the sack.

Test breath on girlfriend (who detests cigar breath) and ask if breath stinks.  Do not lead her with any information.

The result?  No trace of cigar odour.  None.  She said my breath smelled fresh and slightly minty.  Not like mouth wash but just fresh.

I'm going to continue to test it out but the first results are encouraging.",,False,self,t5_2r090,False,,,True,t3_136l5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/136l5s/hate_that_funky_cigar_mouth/,

I know that several of you here are just as involved in different subs as you are here and I think that is absolutely awesome.  Today I realized that as we are moving towards the 5,000-aficionado mark that the powder keg was lit.  This thread has turned into a complaining party about who is posting what and it’s turning into a “circle jerk”. 

Come on guys... let get serious... This reddit is growing very quickly and these things are going to happen now and again, it’s natural with a large group of people, but the hive-mind is a dangerous thing and I know that Reckoner was targeted this time, he’s more than able to take the brunt of this one.  He’s put more information about himself on the Internet than most of us are willing to do.  I've gotten to have some conversations with him and he's a good guy that any of us would probably not mind to have a cigar with.


There are a few directions that we can go from here:

1. Upvote and Downvote: Use them... it was created to make things trend upwards if people like them and downward if they are disliked.  If you don’t like it, apply to reddit and change the system.

2. Post some content, do a review video, write something up. I’m not saying to go onto BlogSpot and make your own daily/weekly reviews, there are several guys on here that are doing a great job and helping several people along the way. 

3. Unsubscribe. Plain and simple. You no longer are enjoying yourself, start your own Sub that is “Cigar Reviews” or something similar. 

4. When was the last time that you were smoking with some of your friends and were talking about the “woody notes” or the “grassy scent off of the foot”... you probably didn’t, you were busy talking about how you went down to Panara Bread and thought the chick was cute, asked her out, holy crap she said yes! You tell your friends that. You show your friends your new business cards because who doesn’t love having something with their name on it? Grilling out with buddies and taking a silly picture.  If you’ve ever ventured to the wonderful sidebar you will find this in the first link:


*“I like to think of this place as a virtual cigar lounge where you can share what you're interested in. Since you're here for cigars in the first place, the conversation lends itself primarily to that, but we're also here to chat about the same type of things you chat about during a good herf with a friend or a stranger at the B&amp;M. Your trials and triumphs are just as good conversation as the new stick you found that you really enjoy - we want to hear about that new job you got, or that school you just got accepted to while you're smoking your celebratory stick (or that girl you broke up with, or the terrible day at work you had that you can console with an always-faithful, ever-relaxing stick)”*
	*BloodOrangeBitters (10-1-2011)*


If we call each other Brothers and Sisters, start acting like it. Leave the childish bickering aside and just take a step back and act like adults, which I assume we can all like to be treated as. 

Please use this to discuss moving forward because I do not want this “lounge” to be tainted by someone that was tired of something that was not hand-rolled by lit by a torch. 

Happy smoking fellow B/SOTL,

He took the time to invest in my future not with money but his time and knowledge. I have many memories of him, of time spent with him, However, for the last few years, I allowed my own arrogance and pride to keep me from seeing him. I was fortunate enough to be able to see him, two days before he died.

Next time you pull on your favorite stick ,remember the people who invested in your life, encouraged you, and who got you into cigars. In addition, if there is bad blood between you and them, try to fix it.

In the 90's I entered into my cigar geek phase with a passion and began traveling to Central America and the Caribbean to visit farms and factories on my own accord.

I was one of the earliest and most prolific posters on alt.smokers.cigars (ASC), hosted some of the very first ""herfs"", ran a cigar blog ten years before the word blog was even part of the vernacular and have been published in many cigar magazines. 

In 2000, I joined JR Cigars and worked directly for Lew Rothman (a genius imo) for 4+ years and then became the President and a Partner in Drew Estate in 2005. Today I am the CEO and I am directly responsible for tobacco and factory operations and production in Esteli, Nicaragua, which employs over 1,300 dedicated and hardworking people in addition to my corporate officer responsibilities.

I have been hands on involved in most aspects of the handmade cigar business from harvest, pre-industry, blending, production, packaging, marketing, sales and strategy. 

I have learned over the years, the more I learn the more I realize I do not know, yet after nearly 25 years I still enjoy learning and expanding my own knowledge about the cigars we all love.

Part of my passion is communicating with my fellow cigar smokers so as time permits I still to this day try to participate online.

The following text is a shameless ripoff from another botl.  I feel he said it very well and it very much needs to be expressed here.  I hope that at least some of you will take this to heart.

Post ripped from Mark(N2Adventure) at www.cigarasylum.com 2008.

This has been on my mind for quite some time and only write this with the most heartfelt intentions.

I have noticed something that is a little disturbing to me but really none of my business but as a friend to many, I thought it best to express my views. (especially with newer/younger BOTLs)

The problem?

I've noticed many BOTLs who are over extended on their credit in the name of acquiring more cigars. I've heard some disturbing balances being maintained on their credit cards, defaulted student loans, book money, etc... due to large number of purchases of cigars.

I believe that with the amount of discussions in the forums, pictures of collections being shown, crazy sales by retailers, that it is easy to get caught up in the ""keeping with the Jones'"" mentality but I would be remiss if I didn't express my concern.

PLEASE keep in mind that cigars are a hobby and should be BUDGETED for and is SOLELY based on disposable income. You SHOULD NOT be ""investing"" in cigars - they are a consumable that are susceptible to damage (fire, water, improper storage, beetles, theft, etc...).

People talk about a ""cigar budget"" and we all laugh when we blow that budget. But like any other aspect of your life, you REALLY should have a ""cigar budget"" and stick that budget the same as you would for emergency savings (6+ months), vacation savings, retirement, etc...

The senseless act of carrying credit card debt just to amass a cigar collect is not fiscally responsible and you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run.

The one thing that I have learned over the nearly 2 decades of being into cigars is that it's is not about the cigars. The cigars are just a compliment to the commaradarie. Yeah, the cigars are good but meeting new people and developing longer term friendships has been the best part of the hobby to me. There are many people that I now consider friends (some stay at my home) and I wouldn't have met them otherwise.

My point?

In the great scheme of the cigar community, cigar are meaningless and should not be coveted to the point where we throw away common sense and fiscal responsibility.

So please, take a step back and look at YOUR financial plan (if you don't have one, then make one!). It is your responsibility to take care of your financial security.

I think something like this would be good for this community too. List all of the popular (and unpopular) cigar sites (CigarBid, CigarMonster, Famous Smoke, CI, Thompsons) and list the pros and cons of each.

It would also be cool, IMHO, to have a list of reputable reviewers, such as the Cigar Surgeon, Robby Ras, etc.

I just wanted to put this idea out to the public and see what you all thought.

*Please upvote for visibility and discussion, I gain no karma from self-posts such as this one.*

**Edit: People have suggested that the vendor list should be generated by the community. I would be down to start the list this weekend, and share it with you all when I am done. Then you could add to it.**

**edit 2:** Based on responses is seems like a good idea. I will start a list this week and post it by Saturday. If you would like to add to the list, after it is uploaded, PM me and I will make changes. That way the trolls cannot edit the spreadsheet.

I, among with many others, are skipping over those imgur linked pictures of ""look what I am smoking"", or ""look what I picked up"".  That is great that you are doing something cigar related, but its importance is lessened without a backstory, explanation of the cigars, a simple review, or anecdote.  We can all take pictures from our phone and do a quick upload, but I believe the majority can agree that it is getting old.


**Proposal:**

Create a self-post with links to the pictures or picture and add some dialogue.  If you received a new box of cigars, how much did they go for, and where did you get them?  Are you going to age them, maybe trade them?  


Even if you really want that sweet sticky karma that is plentiful within this subreddit (haha), or are too lazy to self-post then at least add some dialogue in a comment within your post.


We are not going to start deleting posts with just pictures, but we would like to see a scholarly effort at moving from ""hey, cool picture!"", to invigorating conversation.


This is just a (strong) suggestion.  Please feel free to comment below in response to this post.

I went back to the doctors today and spoke with him. As I was walking out, I mentioned cigars again. He apparently misunderstood me last time...

I said I DO NOT inhale, and I usually only have like 1-3 a week. And he was like, ""Oh! That won't affect a surgery! You don't inhale, right? They're nothing like cigarettes. I have a cigar after dinner sometimes!""

**AWWWWW YEEEEAAAAAHHH!!!**

So that's it! I'm still going for surgery (which is going to suck) but I can still smoke a reasonable amount of cigars! Now, I am going so slow down... A LOT. I know it's not the best thing for my health, so I'm gonna cut back to like 1 a week, if that. (Trying to live a little more healthy than before.)

I have quit smoking my beloved Djarum Blacks, which I did inhale. They are basically cigarettes, but call them little cigars. I'm proud of myself for that. It's been 3 days since my last one. My girlfriend is very happy about this. 

Concerning the video reviews, I'll be doing one here and there. Not as much as before. I think my record was something like 5 videos in one week. 

So, looks like I'm back (kinda)! Thank you all again for the support in my last post, I nearly cried reading some of the comments you posted. You guys are the fucking BEST!

I grew up in (and work in) Fort Collins.  This is where the High Park fire is burning with no hope of containment any time soon.  The fire is almost the size of Denver itself.  Still at 0% containment.  As I watch the hourly news updates,  I am heavy hearted to confirm so many places gone--the place I first learned to climb, the place where I blissfully hiked with my dog so many times (RIP), the last place I went camping with my friend Scott before he passed away, where I watched the sun rise over my city with the love of my life....all reduced to a FEMA map and plume of smoke 100 miles long.  

I post this as I reflect on the important things: human bonds, the things we would be willing to lose in exchange for the people we would do anything to keep.  As the Blackhawk helicopters fly overhead, filling up at the nearby lake, I watch my friends and their children hold eachother and weep.  You see they were given the evacuation order yesterday.  They had to choose what they could pack in a single car in 15 minutes to be the potential last of their worldly possessions.  They just learned their house is surrounded on 3 sides by the fire and will likely be lost.  The 4 of them--the couple responsible for introducing my wife and I and their two small children have moved in with us.  

Watching and holding them as they mourn for the impending loss of nearly everything they own, I ache within.  They still somehow cling to the fact that they have the most important thing right in their arms and smile between sobs at each other while reminding how much they love one another.  The smoke billows in the distance and I struggle to keep from being overwhelmed at the humanity unfolding before me.

Although I have never met most of you BOTLs and AOTM, we share a kinship in that each one of us enjoy the small moments in life that remind us how good it can be.  We take comfort in comfort.  We firmly understand the invaluable importance of relaxing and enjoying something; anything so much that we smile head to toe--inside and out.  Some of the most introspective moments in my life have been spent with a cigar in my mouth and this post is part thanks: thanks for the comraderie in sharing your enthusiasm for the finer things and part reminder:  reminder that we not only should take the time to enjoy the finer things, but to enjoy the *people* that make it all worthwhile.   
Please take a moment to hug that someone; whether it's your spouse, your bf/gf, your pet, your friend, etc.  Let them know that part of you would be missing if they were too.  Smoke one for me fellas and thanks for letting me rant.

I received the following response:

&gt;Thank you for taking the time to let me know about the organizational changes within your R/Cigars group. We too have had some changes at Cigars International. Your previous contact at CI, Ariel Santos is no longer in our Customer Service Department.
 
&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Jared Gulick, and I am eager to take the lead in discussing the future of R/Cigars and Cigars International. In order to best assit you, I would like to just get some basic information to get started on a proposal. If you could provide the following for me, it would be much appreciated.
 
&gt;How many group members are in R/Cigars?
 
&gt;Which cigars are you looking to purchase?
 
&gt;How many boxes of each cigar are you looking to purchase?
 
&gt;What is price point you would like to stay within?
 
&gt;Do you have contact info for the individual now in charge of your group?
 
&gt;These few questions will help me in establishing a deal that will be mutually benefical. Again, I look forward to working with you. Please do not hestitate to contact me with any questions or concerns.
 

&gt;Sincerely,

&gt;Jared Gulick

&gt;Customer Service

If we wish to continue pursuing this, we will need to determine a few things.  First, who will drive the project?  I can continue to be the point man, but it will be slow going as I don't have a lot of free time during standard business hours to to engage in project leadership.  Second, what do we actually want realistically?  I recommend we use this thread to indicate what we want, both in terms of type of discount(flat rate for a product, specific discount %, rotating deals, etc), and types of products(as in samplers, boxes, packs..not brands).  Please avoid simply listing a grocery list of brands you like at this time.  It may also be beneficial to indicate what your buying expectations might be over the next few months so we can indicate expected volume of business involved.  

Self post, so please upvote for visibility.     

Update 4/24:  I sent the first request to Jared yesterday evening.  After a lengthy writeup about the sub and the benefits the deal could offer I put forth 3 feature requests.  The requests were for a base discount, free shipping, and 'reddit recommends' custom samplers.  Of these I indicated that a base discount had the most support and shipping the least (due to CI offering free shipping on a lot of items already).  I will update again when I receive a response. 

Update 4/26:  Received a message from Jared around the end of the day today saying he was putting together some ideas but needed a little more time, so be patient.",,False,self,t5_2r090,1367023199.0,,,True,t3_1csxou,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1csxou/about_a_cigars_international_deal_for_rcigars/,

Spent 4 days in the hospital, got two stents implanted on Monday, and have to go put a third one in in a couple of weeks. Not a fun weekend, overall!


But, as I was being released, my cardiologist came by to have the inevitable ""lifestyle change"" talk with me. Here's how it went:


""You have to eat better. You must stop smoking. Completely."" He went on to tell me about what smoking does to the cardiovascular system, to the lungs, to the blood vessels, ""...just ONE cigarette...""

My wife (interrupting): ""He's never smoked a cigarette.""

Me: ""Cigars.""

Cardiologist (with a bit of a wide eyed surprised look on his face), ""Ahh. Well, I suppose the argument could be made that one SMOKES a cigarette, but only TASTES a cigar.""

Most of the suggestions in the **[Suggestion Box](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/126bs6/suggestion_box/)** were to produce a new type of flair.  While we would love to add these extra things, we want to enhance what already exists.

So for the next month (maybe even longer) we will be automating the [+] trade verification system.  This way we hope that those without their [+] will be able to get set up in trades more quickly.

Another thing we have decided is to make AotM (Aficionado of the Month) more special.  Not only will they have the task of representing the community, picking the Cigar/s of the Month, and being a general awesome B/SOTL, they will choose the theme and run the month's trade.  So if you are chosen to be the December AotM, you will set up the trade and theme for January!  (Since I am bringing this up now, Avrus, please let me know if you want to theme and set up the holiday trade).

----

**WHAT WE NEED FROM THE COMMUNITY:**

We need a new moderator! This moderator will take over all verification processes for the time being while we implement an automated trade verification system.  You will take over for Bitaemo in setting up trades and then giving [+] Flair to those who complete a successful trade.  Once the automation process is done, you can stay full time if you so choose to help us on our future projects.  We won't be voting for a new mod, the new mod will be chosen between the current active moderators.  Please comment below or send me a PM if you are interested in moderating.  *Please don't request to be a mod if you don't plan on being active and maintaining the verification trade system.*

**Thanks everyone for being an awesome community!!!**

Thanks to Chris King, better known as **slackwaresupport**, and in coordination with his new Cigar Store; ""CK Cigar Shop"" which will be open soon; we will have the opportunity to sell either the Xi1 or Xi2 at ridiculous dealer prices.

----

The **[Xi1](http://xikar.com/products/cutters/xi1/100ti/#)** will cost **$55.00**.  This price includes shipping and tax, and is **$15 cheaper** than their [online store price](http://xikar.com/products/cutters/xi1/101jya/).  This cutter would be **engraved**.  From the website: *The XIKAR® Xi1 Cutter gives cigar enthusiasts the finest cigar cut with power, efficiency and ease of use. An aluminum body encases HRC57 stainless steel blades in a spring-loaded, ergonomic shape.*

The **[Xi2](http://xikar.com/products/cutters/xi2/#)** will cost **45.00**. This price includes shipping and tax, and is **$5 cheaper** than their online store price (for custom).  This cutter would be **pad printed**.  From the website: *These cutters have blades hardened to a Rockwell C rating of 57, the result is the hardest, sharpest blade you can buy.  The body retains the classic XIKAR shape and features a lightweight nylon fiberglass composite in an assortment of metallic colors.*


All Xi cutters are the same ring gauge: they will cut a 54 ring gauge cigar in half. Depending on how much cap you cut, they will cut up to a 58 ring gauge cigar.

----

**I NEED you to leave a comment below IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN PURCHASING ONE (or more), requesting which one you would prefer.**

**PLEASE COMMENT Xi1 or Xi2.**  

----

If we get enough follow along we will have a design contest, and once the design is chosen (by you guys of course!) Chris King will be accepting payments through his online store.  Once we meet a designated number (probably 50), Xikar will make our cutters, send them to Chris, and then he will ship them out to you.  If this falls through for some reason (for some reason Xikar doesn't give us our cutters) you will be refunded your money.

EDIT 1: If this is the first Xikar post you have seen let me catch you up.  We are working on (and getting pretty damn close) to getting our very own custom r/cigars Xikar Xi1 or Xi2.  Anyone can buy one, you do not need a plus.


Edit 2: **CANADIANS WILL BE ABLE TO GET THE XIKAR CUTTER!** It will be 8 extra dollars for shipping!!!


Edit 3:  Chris pointed out that Xikar's have a lifetime warranty!


Edit 4: After Chris receives all the money (if we decide to go with 50, he will need 50 payments) he will pay Xikar and they will take up to 3 weeks to make the cutters.  As soon as Chris receives them he will ship them out. 


Edit 5: Non-plus members can purchase cigar cutters!

Edit 6: **Did not factor in Xikar's website's shipping costs, we are actually saving $25 on the Xi1 and $15 on the Xi2!!!!**

Edit 7: **THIS JUST IN, CHRIS JUST APPROVED INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING!

This is absolutely unacceptable, and we're implementing a few new rules:

* **ALL** trades must have a tracking number.  No exceptions.  If we contact you regarding a trade and you cannot provide tracking, it will be assumed that you did not ship.
* Unless otherwise discussed between yourself and your trade partner, you are expected to ship within one week of pairing or delivery of the first half of the trade (depending on if you're the first or return shipper).
* If you require a delay, you **MUST** stay in contact with your trade partner.  If it is catastrophic event and your delay will be longer than one month, you **MUST** contact the mods to explain the situation and we will work something out from there.
* If you fail to ship within the agreed upon time frame (with the default being one week), you will lose your verified status on the subreddit and will have to go through a verification trade again.
* If you fail to ship within one month of the agreed upon time frame (including any arrangements made with your trade partner or the mods), you will be tagged as ""DO NOT TRADE"" and may be banned from the subreddit.

The plus system is meant to be a sign that you are a respectable member of the /r/cigars community.  Trades are a voluntary obligation, and if you cannot fulfill that obligation in a timely manner, **DO NOT** sign up for trades.

To be honest with you, when I saw pictures of the contraption, my thoughts primarily consisted of **ghetto**, **cheap**, and **cheesy**.  Little did I know as I coddled my 50-count desktop humidor, I would be resorting to the same tactics.  

What you need to realize is, creating a humidor out of a cooler is very simple. You can do it with any size cooler, and the steps are generally the same.  While I am going to do the best job I can walking you through the entire process in detail, I want you to know that greater men than I have done better jobs setting up coolerdors.  The main goal of this post is to get you to grasp that (a) anyone can do it, and (b) it is surprisingly effective. 



**For those who don’t have the time to read the 1648 words written below, here is a quick summary:**
---

*1. Choose a clean cooler with a good seal*

*2. Clean and dry it thoroughly*

*3. Line it with cedar, or fill it with boxes to prepare humidity regulation*

*4. Charge the coolerdor*

*5. Fill it with cigars*


**[Now to turn my Igloo Cooler into a coolerdor]( http://i.imgur.com/usi9tcT.jpg?1)**

---


**Choosing the right cooler**
---



New or used, choosing the right cooler is the most important part of beginning this project.  There are four factors you need to consider when choosing a cooler.

* **Size**

Pick a size that you are comfortable with.  When I scrounged for my first cooler (60qt) out of my garage, it could hold about 75-125 cigars depending on how I organized them. Having a collection of ~50 cigars at the time, this was a very comfortable option.  When I maxed out my first cooler, I crawled up into the attic and found an identical cooler.  The two stacked perfectly and sat in the corner of my closet. 

* **Seal**


It is essential that the cooler you choose has a good seal. Check it for gaps, see that it closes decently tight, and make sure there are no holes or cracks anywhere in the cooler body.  My two medium sized coolers had a loose seal so I used packaging tape to tighten the lip of the cooler.  My giant Igloo cooler (used for the demonstration) has a naturally tight seal, which is pulled even tighter by the two clamps.


* **Cleanliness**

I have gone the path of the used cooler (you don't need to). This is perfectly fine as long as the cooler can be cleaned.  If after cleaning there is any type of smell or grunge, keep cleaning or move on to the next cooler. 


* **Price**


Walmart and Amazon are the only two stores I have ever considered purchasing coolers from.  Igloo and Coleman are going to be the best quality for seal, size, price, and durability, so I suggest sticking with one of these brands.  Buying or finding used is always a better option (as it saves $$$), but if you need to buy, do some research and find a price you are comfortable with.

---


**Cleaning the cooler**
---


(Before you begin, consider beginning the process of **[recalibrating your hygrometers]( http://i.imgur.com/NO2Y4GP.jpg?1)**.)


Regardless of it being new or used, the cooler needs a good scrubbing, inside and out.  On the outside, I use ammonia-free Sparkle (Windex knock-off) and paper towels to **[make sure all the dirt, grime, and dust are removed]( http://i.imgur.com/KHdaoC1.jpg?1)**.  Clean the underside of the cooler lid the same way, and afterwards take a wet cloth and wipe it down, finishing with a cloth to dry the cooler.

There is a special method I take to cleaning the inside of the cooler to insure there is no odor when it is all said and done.  **[Fill the cooler with hot water]( http://i.imgur.com/y49qHr4.jpg?1)** and .5 cups of ammonia free cleaner (per 50qts).  Once again, I use Windex’s underappreciated friend, ‘Sparkle’.  Let this sit for 2-3 hours.  Using a brush or wash cloth, give the inside of the cooler a good scrubbing with the **[water still in it]( http://i.imgur.com/VTodWsi.jpg?1)**.  Empty out the water and rinse the inside of the cooler out thoroughly with hot water, removing any excess water/cleaner solution.

**Dry it thoroughly.**  


After letting it sit for another hour, check to see if there are any noticeable odors coming from inside the cooler. If it still smells like cleaner, rinse it a few more times, and dry thoroughly.  If there are no odors and it is **[glistening]( http://i.imgur.com/GLacnTE.jpg?1)**, move on to the next step.

---

**Turning the cooler into a COOLERDOR**
---


Plastic does not absorb moisture, so in order to provide a stable environment in which humidity will be easily regulated, we need to trick the cooler into believing it’s a humidor.  There are three methods used to regulate humidity in a cooler that I am aware of.

**1: The Fill and Pray Method**


This is the method of filling your cooler with cigars and hoping that the simple act of being full of cigars will keep the cooler at the precise humidity you want to achieve.   The more cigars in the cooler, the better the regulation will be. 


**2: Box Tetris**

Keeping boxes in your cooler is a fantastic way of regulating humidity and keeping your cigars organized at the same time.  You can get empty boxes for free (or fairly cheap) at local B&amp;M’s or eBay.  I prefer **[simple traditional style boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/odoMLbr.jpg?1)** as they fit better and are easily stacked within the cooler.

**3: Cedar Linings Playbook**

Lining the inside of the cooler is the most hardcore yet effective way of tricking your cooler into believing it is a humidor.  You can purchase cedar roll for fairly cheap (but I have no idea where).  I used the **[cedar found in boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/YwJGw78.jpg?1)**, and **[taped it to the inside walls of the cooler] (http://i.imgur.com/I9D0u3Z.jpg?1)** with an even distribution.  


All in all, I use a combination of the box and cedar lining method.  As I collect more cedar I will add it to the inside of the coolerdor, but it is unnecessary since the cooler will regulate perfectly with the amount of cedar, boxes, and cigars I will be placing in the cooler by the end of this post.


---

**Humidification**
---


For those with desktop humidors or Tupperware, the integrity of the humidity will not be simply maintained with a puck or Boveda humidification pack.  This step of the process is what tends to scare most people away from the coolerdor project, but I will share my (not so) top secret method with you on humidification.  


Enter **Exquisicat Crystals**.


This is a very cheap and reliable method of maintaining your coolerdor’s humidity. At **[Petsmart you can purchase]( http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11256828)** an 8lb package, and a 14lb package.  I opted for the 8lb package knowing that if there is a time in the future that I will need 8lbs of humidification, I will have a serious problem.  Make sure you go with the **Fragrance Free** type of Exquisicat Crystals or you will find in time that you have a very nice collection of infused cigars.


There are plenty of other methods of humidification which can be found in the wiki or via Google, but this was a budget method.  **Used cooler**. **Cheap humidification**. **Happy SecretAgentMang**.


---

**Charging the coolerdor**
---

This is another area where there are infinite variables on how you can charge your coolerdor, so I will share with you my method.


For every 50qts, I find that 1 pound of Exquisicat Crystals works best. For this new Igloo cooler, I may need more, but time will tell.


Because of space, I have found that a small metal bread mold (x2) works perfectly.  I **[fill them]( http://i.imgur.com/eajembM.jpg?1)** a half inch at a time with the crystals, spritzing them with **DISTILLED WATER** before adding the next layer, ensuring that all the crystals are damp with **DISTILLED WATER**.  

*Do not use tap water. Do not use anything else besides distilled water as this is the best solution to use to prevent mold.* **Science.**


Afterwards, I fit the metal bread molds snug in opposite corners, which ensures maximum use of the amount of **[space available]( http://25.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mded1mklTP1qfvgpgo1_500.jpg)**.  As to prevent me from rambling on more than needed further down the post, I simply use the same method to keep the coolerdor regulated on a day to day basis after all is said and done. 


I then **[place all of my empty boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/JKkYmNy.jpg?1)** inside of the coolerdor with a correctly calibrated digital hygrometer, and close the coolerdor.

---

**Playing the waiting game**
---


The next step requires patience.  Every 6 hours or so (or whenever you get around to looking) check your hygrometer.  If it hasn’t reached the humidity percentage you want it to be, check if the crystals are dry (if they are, spritz them), and keep waiting.  If it reaches the humidity you want it to be, you are all set.

---

**Coolerdor organization**
---


Stocking your newly constructed coolerdor is the best part of the process.  However you want to do it is up to you, but I am a very neat and tidy gentleman, and only the best organization will do.  I don’t like any loose sticks floating around the coolerdor, so all of the cigars will be organized in those boxes used to charge the coolerdor (*Wow SecretAgentMang! How Clever!*).



Thank you.



Once I organize the boxes the way I want them, I stack them nicely in the coolerdor, making sure I don’t cover the humidification containers.  For a week or so afterwards make sure to check the humidity once or twice a day to check if it is regulating where you want it.  

---

**Integrating a fan system (optional)**
---

Integrating a fan system is completely optional. The purpose of this is to prevent humidity pockets from forming in your coolerdor.  Essentially, the fan will keep humidity regulated better throughout the coolerdor space, which will lead to happier cigars.


I don’t want to get into too much detail on this because honestly I don’t know enough about wiring computer fans etc. to give you the best information possible.  There are walkthroughs online on how to get a powered fan into your coolerdor, but I choose the simpler method.


If you don’t want the hassle of wires, **[pick the oust fan up]( http://www.amazon.com/Oust-Odor-Free-Outdoor-Scent-each/dp/B0009F3O86/ref=sr_1_1?s=home-garden&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362954629&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=oust+fan).**  They don’t have the strongest breeze, but it will help prevent those dreaded humidity pockets.  The fan requires a D-Cell battery, which should last about 2-3 months before the battery needs to be changed.


---

**[THE FINISHED PRODUCT]( http://i.imgur.com/WMEnwrg.jpg?1)**

**Expenses:**

- Used Igloo Cooler (Holds 500 Cigars) - $10

- Xikar Rectangular Digital Hygrometer - $20

- Exquisicat Crystals (8lb) - $14

- Distilled Water - $2

- Oust fan - $14

**Total: $60**

---

If I can do this, so can you. It is an easy process, and all of the materials required can be found at the local grocery store or can be ordered online.  This is an economical way to safely store mass amounts of cigars.  No, it isn’t as pretty as a desktop or cabinet humidor, but it saves you more money which can be used to fill the coolerdor with cigars. 

I hope that this walkthrough has been informative, and if you have any questions, please post them below and I will do the best I can answering them.  

**Thanks for reading,**

She does.

And then I growl back. With a mouth full of smoke. Which promptly billows out in a giant plume.

It was hilarious: she stops in her tracks, hands flying to her mouth, eyes wide, and runs back to my wife. We were in hysterics.

All the more so when she then says, ""Me want smoke too!""

*My name is Bryan Glynn and I am the Owner of BGPictures.com &amp;
 CigarObsession.com. A website that your company hosts (according to
 WHOIS information) is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my
 company.*

 *A photo was copied onto your servers without permission. The original
 PHOTO, to which we own the exclusive copyrights, can be found at:*

*http://cigarobsession.com/wp-content/gallery/afdc3/20090909_cigar_0002.jpg*

I promptly removed the photograph and contacted Bryan through email asking him if I could use the picture that I found on imgur until my local B&amp;M got another shipment of the Don Carlos.

**3** Bryan replied with:

Don't contact me again.  You are sorry you gut busted, like all the others.  Too bad.

**4** I created an account prier to receiving this email and commented on his post expressing my apologies for using his image.

**5** I tried calling Bryan before receiving the above email as well to which I was going to apologize to him and let him know I did not know it was his image to begin with. Where I had found the image and email him the link to where it was at.

**6** After receiving Bryan's email, I couldn't think of how childish and how blown out of porportion this was that I created another account on his blog to let him know the link to which I found this image in the first place. Which was http://i.imgur.com/DSth8vS.jpg but since has been removed.

With this said, I will continue to smoke cigars with my friends and continue to write reviews. I know there won't be any mind changing on the outlook of myself for what had happened, I just thought everyone should know what happened.

I did change domain names to www.cigarwarrior.com. There were a number of reasons for changing domains and one of which isn't to duck and try to cover my tracks. I understand I messed up and the appropriate thing to do would have been to wait until I got a replacement camera.


**Edit: For formatting and the following:**

I wanted to add that I am not doing reviews for monetary gain or special treatment from anyone. I don't have adds on my website and not looking for hits to it either.

I link reviews on reddit to cigars that I have reviewed not so you will come to my website, but to share cigars I think others would really enjoy

I started the blog after years of smoking cigars with friends. I gained their trust with my recommendations and what I got out of cigars they could relate to. I wanted to blog and bring my thought to paper (or keyboard). The end result is a full blown blog with reviews and cigar events etc.

**Edit #2**

I talked to a regular at my cigar lounge about this (lawyer). He sated since the picture was removed within the 48 hour windows for these actions and there wasn't any monetary gain from his image, he could try but wouldn't get anything.

I also talked to him about the harassing emails and phone calls from the people on his blog and he stated I can file a harassment lawsuit against him and his website for publishing my personal phone number for malicious and harassing intent and without my consent.

**Edit #3**

Complaint has been filled with my local sheriff's office for removal of content for harassment and no consent to post my personal information.

**Edit #4**

I want the reddit cigar community to know that I don't post my reviews on here to gain anything from it. I like the people I have met and traded cigars with. I love to share my cigar smoking experiences. I have no ads on my website nor do I gain anything from your visit. I know my reviews won't appeal to everyone and that is ok. Just like cigars, everyone has their own opinion. 

Thanks Reddit for the support and the kind pms that were sent.

With this new site, your trades will be tracked and you'll receive notifications (from CigarBot) when your trade partner has shipped or received your package.  Verification trades will be automated to match users up as well as supply their + on the subreddit when new users successfully complete their trades.

A few things to note:

* Your account must be 30 days old to use the site.  No longer will new user accounts be allowed to go through verification prior to the 30 day mark.
* You must maintain positive link and comment karma in order to access the site.
* To sign up for a verification trade, you must have an active address within the system.  This is necessary for pairing as well as checking against known scumbag addresses.  Once you are verified, there is no requirement to maintain an active address.
* Trades may only be requested of verified users.  An unverified user may request a verification trade with a verified user, but not the reverse.

I'm going through the last phases of testing this evening, and will make a post tomorrow when it's up and running.  More things are coming down the pipeline, but this will help /u/Bitaemo and /u/dlm04e relax a little bit, especially as we get closer to 20,000 subscribers.  Thanks everyone!

EDIT: One more thing... for those of you who want bragging rights, do me a favor and start collecting the links for the bombs and trades you've done in the past (where the recipient thanks you).

----

**When?**
----

**Friday, September 20th** and **Saturday, September 21st - 2013**

----

**What?**
----

What is this you ask? A giant non-commercial herf that not only supports two amazing cigar lounges in Chicago, but creates a great opportunity for a ton of us to meet up, smoke cigars, and chat with members of the industry. We will stuff our faces, smoke til our heads explode, and probably drink til we are xXReckonerXx obnoxious.

----

**Who is invited?**
----

Everybody.  We have Avrus (aka CigarSurgeon) who has already booked a ticket from Canada.  Other /r/Cigars members that are seriously considering making the journey:

- Speedgeek - South Carolina

- T_Avalon - New York

- Bitaemo - Canada

- TheMcG - Canada

- dlm04e - Florida

- Champster - Mississippi

- VictoryVino - Michigan

Of course we already have a bunch of Chicago redditors like myself, insanemo, jpastin, kilrpenguin, Tanavarro etc. that will be there!

----

**Why?**
----

Because fuck you, that's why.

----

**Where?**
----

**Friday - [Tesa Cigar Co.](http://tesacigars.com/)**

Friday night will be the first leg of the Chicago Meetup.  We are still sorting out details with the owner of Tesa, so this event summary is theoretical (but likely).  We will be hanging out with over 150 FOTL (Family of the Leaf) and dozens of manufacturers/industry members at the beautiful inner city lounge.  Music, raffles, catered dinner, beer sampling, and cigars will line the evening and well into the night. Afterwards whoever is interested will hit the bars in downtown Chicago.  Tesa is BYOB.

**Saturday - [Casa de Montecristo](http://casademontecristo-chicago.com/)**

Saturday will be the second day and the longer of the two days.  From 12pm til midnight, you will be smoking with some of the best in the industry.  The extremely well-stocked humidors at Casa de Montecristo will be at our disposal - filled with very rare and delicious hard to find cigars.  The very large VIP lounge will be open, and we will have a Chicago Style catered buffet for everyone.  Some time during the event, we will have a rum tasting (pending). Casa de Montecristo is BYOB.

----

**Tickets**
----

**Tickets will begin to sell July 8th**, when we have all the sponsor items locked in.  The price is probably going to be **$35 which covers both day's events**.  If you only can attend one day or the other, the ticket price will be $20. 

**There will only be 150 spots for each night - so tickets will be limited.**

And as I was in the middle of writing this, Brian from the CRA gave me a call.  We will also include a ticket option that will be **$60-$65 and will include a year long membership to the CRA, and two cigars** AND will include everything from the $35 ticket option. **BOOYAH.**  There will be more details on that when we lock things in, but that is a fantastic deal.


**What you receive with your ticket purchase:**

- A gift bag with 7-8 cigars (3-4 Cigars at Tesa, 4 Cigars at Casa de Montecristo)

- Dinner at Tesa

- Dinner at Casa de Montecristo
 
- A raffle ticket for each event (for every $25 you spend at the B&amp;M, you will get additional raffle tickets)

- Access to liquor tastings that we are putting together (21 years of age and up)

**What the ticket is covering for us:**

- $15 is going to charity (charity TBD)

- $10 is going to Tesa for catering costs (in theory)

- $10 is going to Casa de Montecristo for catering costs

- (If you purchase the CRA ticket $25-$30 will be going to the CRA)

----

**Sponsors**
----

In order to fill the bags we need sponsors. Currently we have ~~two~~ **three** sponsors, but until they are set in stone, I am not going to announce who they are... but trust me - it's good stuff. If you are reading this, and want to sponsor this event - please PM me.  We are going to make it worthwhile for companies to sponsor the event.

Aside from sponsors we will also have a lot of special guests, and it should be a very knowledgeable/fun event for all. 

----

**Hotels and Travel**
----

We are working on getting a group rate at a Holiday Inn near Casa de Montecristo. A part of the group rate will include shuttle service between Casa de Montecristo and the hotel. It is looking to be $99 a night.

As much as Insanemo and I would like to taxi everyone around all weekend, we will be extremely busy making sure everything runs smoothly.  Please look into renting a car or cabbing it when visiting Chicago!

----

**In closing**
----

There was a reason I published this event 2 months before we start selling tickets.  First of all, I want those outside of Chicago to have enough time to make arrangements if they are interested in going.

Second of all, I want to reach out to /r/Cigars - Chicago area members who would be interested in joining the committee, and those outside Chicago that might be able to help us land a few more sponsors.

If you are interested in either, comment below, or send me a PM.

------

**Thanks for putting up with my long-winded-ness!** 

If you have any questions, concerns, or most importantly - suggestions - please comment below and I will address them the best I can.

This is due to me changing jobs. As of yesterday, I am going to be the new sales associate at Holts Cigar Company in Center City Philadelphia. 

The job I am currently at is a dead end job. I am literally at the top step I can be, and this is where i started. I currently work for a small company who will not pay me any more than what I am making now. 

So when the General Manager got ahold of me personally and offered me the job, I couldnt turn it down. Not only does this open up the opportunity of advancement, but Holts is owned by Ashton. So Ashton's door is now opened to me. 

Now you can see why my review website would be a bit of a Conflict on Interest. 

I want to personally thank everyone who has helped me along the way and for everyone who supported me along the way. You never know, I might just post a review of some of the Holts Exclusive cigars here (since im sure they wouldnt mind that) haha. 

So just so you all know, I wont be leaving, just my reviews will be. Ill still be posting pictures, and engaging in conversation.

You guys are a family to me, and without you guys my website would have been nothing. 

If you guys are ever in Philadelphia after July 1st be sure to stop in and burn one with me.

Be creative; maybe send some sticks you love or some sticks you think they'll love, maybe send some sticks you hate, but don't troll too hard. It's sorta like Cupid's version of trick or treat.

1344629729.0,74,self.cigars,y0ism,Cigars and Women,J_H_W,97,23,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/y0ism/cigars_and_women/,"As a novice in the Cigar world there’s a lot that I don’t know, but it only took one look from the wife to realize that while there may be some ladies in this world that enjoy cigars and the lifestyle—

*She aint gonna be one of them*.

Now, I’m not throwing money away, not killing the kid’s college fund, missing the mortgage, or eating hydrox ramen for dinner; but $35-$60 goes up in smoke every week and if it isn’t on fire it’s just waiting to be burned.

There’s something primal about smoking a huge stogie, something that makes our testosterone stand up and say “Atta boy”.  It’s the same reason we watch endless football, eat steak so bloody it looks like a Warhol painting, drink aged whisky even though it tastes like gasoline, or punch that bully in middle school.

*It makes you feel like a man*.

For some of us, our grandfathers were cigar men.  We had baseball cards stored in cigar boxes before we even knew what cigar boxes were.  When we followed them out to the tool shed (or rather were sent there to retrieve a tool box, a pair of wire cutters, a plumbob or one of a million different other things) we came back heavy with the smell of fine tobacco.  For others maybe it was a Father, or a father figure, a baseball coach, a college professor-- someone taught us that cigars were the tools of gentlemen.  It allows a man time to think, to reflect, to gauge his current success (or his recent failures) and to come to a conclusion—if only for a minute that our place in this world is still strong. To have those fleeting moments of clarity (relaxation?) that life is sometimes just about the moment, and right now that moment is good.  

Conversely, all women do this in one way or another in ways like (not to be sexist, just general) cooking, sewing, painting, pottery—whatever it is—they do it because at one time in their life their hero, or their mothers, grandmothers, etc did it too, and it makes them feel connected; makes them feel like a woman.  

What I've also learned is that every woman (like every cigar) is going to react different, understand differently, and if you’re going to find relative peace in this new hobby here's a list of ground rules for the beginner.

1. Don’t expect her to understand why you love it

2. Don’t try to teach her why you love it, or justify the action.      It’s still a risky hobby and where there’s 
smoke there’s cancer, so realize that your health—not your fun, is her priority.

3. Pace yourself.  Want to kill a lady’s tolerance for cigars?  Smoke one every night, or every other night. As in anything, if you lose your sense of moderation, you may lose your hobby.

4. Keep the smell off you and OUT of the house.  Buy a smoking jacket, invest in some good lawn furniture, keep some scope by your smoke spot.  Just stay fresh.  

5. Tacit agreement is just as good as excitement.  Want to buy a new box of Ligas, take a road trip to a B&amp;M that got a shipment of Opus’s?  If she throws up her hands, rolls her eyes, or generally treats it like any other dumbass man activity take it as consent, but get out of the house before she can change her mind.

6. Don’t EVER talk about Cigar Bid.  

7. Don’t EVER talk about Cigar Bid

8. If it’s causing animosity or tension cut it back.  No hobby in the world is worth a lonely night on the couch (especially since you probably can’t smoke a cigar there either)

Women are our partners, in addition to sometimes being our opposites; and their opinions deserve respect and consideration.  They love us for the idiots we are, give us the best part of ourselves in our children, and bring a certain serenity to life that we can’t find on our own.

Besides, most cigars take about an hour anyway, which is more than enough time for even the most short-tempered woman to calm down, and start making sandwiches.

1335054382.0,69,self.cigars,slz2n,State Of The Subreddit,jokeheads,107,38,121,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/slz2n/state_of_the_subreddit/,"I've been gone for the past week and could only lurk, save for one quick post I was able to get off from my phone. However, after reading others' thoughts and having time to think myself, I've decided I'd like to share a few ideas.

First of all, everyone chill the fuck out. We're a bunch of cigar-loving bros and some of us are getting real edgy and maniacal over what boils down to being simply **a hobby** (one that embodies relaxation). 

Okay sweet, now that we've all had our favorite full-bodied stogie and are well relaxed... here we go...

I've been here for a while. The subreddit has gone in and out of vogue for me, but I've certainly been here for a while (I think one of the first 400 members and a member of the first or second monthly trade). Now, that doesn't make me an expert, and it doesn't mean I'm right... but  it does mean I've read/lurked a lot of posts and noticed trends of this subculture. 

In that time, I've made a few observations, with proposed solutions:

* The mods have been inactive. Guys, I know real-life comes up and other things get in the way, but others' proposals to add a few to your crew are well-warranted. I'll leave this here, because it seems to be getting addressed - but I support it.

* I have noticed talk of idealism - how some people see this subreddit as best one way or another. There are a lot of different cigar smokers and this sub will always be an amalgamation of the different personalities of those who enjoy our hobby. Some people post a lot. Some post a little. Some will always be noobs. Some will be resident-experts. I am thankful we have such a good, varied crew. I hope you are too!

* As a brief extension of that, I am very proud of how well new aficionados are treated here. Everyone who has answered a question or helped someone earn a plus deserves a round of applause for their selflessness.

* Lastly, the big elephant in the room for me is the content. This sub has turned in to karmawhoring to the extreme. Many posts I see can be summarized as either ""HEY GUYS I JUST GOT MY SHIPMENT IN FROM [cigar site]. CHECK IT OUT AND UPVOTE ME!"" or ""Hey guys, it's a beautiful day and I smoked [CIGAR] with [BEER]. It's cool that I post about it because I [GOT A JOB/FINISHED A TEST]. Upvote me!""

Look, I'm happy for everyone for all of these things, but they really detract from, what I think, is the point of this subreddit: a culture for discussing cigars and mimicking the experience of smoking cigars. The former we have. Questions still get asked and appropriately answered. 

However, the latter has been lacking. **These posts of pictures and no content do not breed discussion.** They are one-sided. 

I propose that posts like those be replaced with self-posts. You link the picture in the post and explain a bit about the situation. You got a job? Congrats...but doing what? How long were you looking? Tell me a bit about it so I can celebrate with you. 

You got your new sticks in? Cool. What are they? How much did you pay? Why'd you choose those? 

Someone's post the other day asking about favorite smoking places was a great example of this. Open-ended. Facilitated good discussion.

**At the end of the day, this place is about discussion. And I think we need more of it. Contributing is more than posting pictures. I am guilty of this and will actively be trying to do better. I hope all of you will as well.** I'd be happy to talk about this further with anyone who is willing to have a civil discussion.

-Your Fellow Aficionado (who is only where he is today because of this subreddit)

Edit: To clarify: there are many posts that are VERY important in their current form: reviews, video reviews, contests, plus-trade pictures (as opposed to monthly trades, which should have some content I think). I think the google hangouts, though I have never partaken, embody my thoughts pretty damn well.

As a community, we have accomplished great things, and will continue to do so.  We are moving forward to the next step in the custom Xi1 process.  If you are just discovering this, please refer [to my last post](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/ylrsw/requesting_rcigars_participation_we_have_received/) to catch up.

Before I go into contest rules, I want to thank Chris King, aka slackwaresupport, and his soon-to-be-open online cigar shop for hosting the Xi1 cutters after they are created and distributed by Xikar.  These Xi1 cutters will cost $55.00 (*includes tax and shipping for US addresses. International shipping will be available and will be calculated at checkout*).  This is **$25 cheaper** than Xikar's online custom price!!!  Anyone is allowed to buy the Xi1; [+] verified or not, guests from other subreddits, friends and family, and random strangers; as long as you pay in full.

**How purchasing will work**

Once we pick a design and get it approved by Xikar, we will open up the cutter for sale on CK's Cigar Shop.  After a few days of accepting purchases, we will place the order for the cutters, and Xikar will take 2-3 weeks to custom engrave and ship out the cutters.  Once Chris receives the cutters, he will get them out super quick.  Depending on popularity, Chris may open up purchases for this cutter in the future.

Announcing the Chrome Extension to get CigarBid price history on the CigarBid page.  No more hunting for prices.  It's now at your fingertips right away.

To install:

1) You must use Chrome.  Sorry FF users.  CHROME RULES! ;)

2) Download [this file](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/127479/CigarBidChrome.crx).

3) Open your extensions page (chrome://chrome/extensions/).

4) Drag the file onto that page.  I would upload this to the Chrome Store for easy install, but this is an /r/cigars EXCLUSIVE.

If you have issues with Chrome saying ""Extensions, apps, and user scripts can only be added from the Chrome Web Store"", follow [this guide](http://www.howtogeek.com/120743/how-to-install-extensions-from-outside-the-chrome-web-store/)

For $35 shipped using coupon code **RCIGARS**, we have developed a beginner sampler that we feel will help guide new smokers in the right direction.  We step over samplers filled with online discounter exclusives, cigars that a company is trying to move, and various samplers that have no purpose.  The whole idea of a sampler is to taste variety, and learn not only about the cigar provided, but to expand your knowledge on existing blends in the market.  Big thanks to Sam at Casa de Montecristo for working with us and giving us a fantastic discount, and thanks to my partner in crime /u/insanemo, who helped develop the samplers that we are very excited about (there are three more samplers arriving soon).

[**PDF explaining each cigar in the sampler!**](https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B5HhjPcTSxTaUUtYV3ItXy1YVG8/edit)

Take notes if you want to, and most importantly make sure you take your time to enjoy the cigar.  Reflect on each puff, the skill and craftsmanship that went into blending, prepping, and rolling each cigar, and enjoy the mini-vacation lighting up a stogie gives you.  The 1-3 hours it takes for you to smoke a cigar is yours.

**Smoke them in this order on separate days!**

(We want to keep your palette fresh for each experience)

- E.P. Carillo Short Run 2012

- Curivari Limitada Reserva 3000 Limitada

- Drew Estate Undercrown Corona Viva

*Edit*:  Insanemo has told me that they do not ship Internationally, to Hawaii, and Washington DC.  If you are in IL you will be charged our home state tax (bummer, I know).  For those who can't receive the sampler but want one, we can work out something within the community in which you send the sampler to a member, and then they ship them out to you.

~~**EDIT 2**: Currently the coupon code is set at free shipping for orders above $50.  That is set wrong and we are waiting for them to switch back to normal (free shipping no matter what).  Thanks for being patient!~~

**EDIT 3: COUPON CODE RCIGARS WORKS FOR FREE SHIPPING!!!**

He had told them last week in an email that he wanted to cancel his subscription to their Cigar of the Month Club. 

Uh oh. 

I could literally hear the woman on the phone trying to convince him to not cancel. She was basically begging, saying that they would give him extra ""points"" to use on his next purchase, yada yada yada. He politely said no and he would like to cancel his subscription. When asked why, he explained that he would rather purchase and support his local shop instead of an online retailer. 

Didn't end there. 

He got transferred to another person. Same deal. Trying to convince him not to cancel. He again declined, I heard the guy on the other end say after about 10 more minutes of him trying to say he wanted out of the subscription, ""Fine. It's cancelled."" Click. 

The guy hung up on him. No ""thank you for your business"" or ""sorry to see you go"", just hung up. How professional, huh? 

Tl;dr

**DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THOMPSON CIGARS. THEY WILL CALL YOU AND SPAM YOUR MAILBOX UNTIL THE DAY YOU DIE. THEY ARE SHADY AND IMMORAL IN THEIR MARKETING TACTICS. DO NOT ORDER FROM THOMPSON CIGARS**

I pulled the motorcycle out of the garage, gave it a wash, and decided to work on polishing all that chrome!  Parked my keester in a camping chair, fired up a ROMEO and spent the afternoon in the sun detailing my bike and enjoying a very nice cigar.  

Polished off the day by giving my son his first ride on the motorcycle.....just around the block.  A ride he finished by saying, ""Best day EVER!!""

On top of all of this she didn't get her social security when she was supposed to so I was responsible for all of the bills instead of half. 

Anyway, this all culminated right when I got the irc pass and the cotm pass. I fell a little behind and didn't communicate any of this very well. Simply put I was utterly overwhelmed. 

So I apologize to the guys in both passes and the community. Both packages went out today. Everything is now the up and up. My ankle is almost healed. My grandma is home and on different meds and the bills are all caught up.

I showed up to work at 1400 yesterday, just a normal night. Then things slowly went south. As I got further and further in to a colosal fuck up the day shift left me I got more and more pissed. 

The hours slowly ticked away. The kids in bed, the wife asking when I would be home and me not having a clue. The civilians I work with slowly trickle out and the knot I am working on is getting bigger. At about 0315, my 13th hour of stairing at a computer I take a nice stroll.

 Go back in and get into it again. I unravale the mess and needless to say I am hot. All I want to do is go home and crawl into bed with my beautiful wife and savor the few mins I would get with her befor she has to get up and get the kids off to school. That is not in the cards because I have to stay and wait for day shift to come in so I can catch the boss up and get everything where it needs to be. 

Then I rememberd......... I hit the B&amp;M up on my way in yesterday. I brew a pot of coffee, poor a cup, go out to my car, turn on the radio and light up a Padrone Maduro something or other, can't even remember what I grabbed. 

I am about half way through this amazing stick and relaxing to Mumford and Sons and ya know, lt's not that bad. This simple leaf, grown thousands of miles away. Picked by hand, aged, rolled and now in my hands brings me a small amout of comfort and peace. That my friends is why I am a Brother of the Leaf.

What worries me is when somebody states things as facts with no basis of proof that are far from the truth, ie. using kitty litter or tap water in our products.

Maybe once or twice you brave the cold and try to enjoy a stick, but no matter what you tell yourself it's just not quite the same.  You can't really ease into a cigar, savour your beverage, not in the cold December grey.  It just feels wrong, there is no relaxing.  It's like ducking out back for a quick cigarette.  It's perfunctory and hurried.  Like the difference between a quick cold shower and a long hot bath.

All winter, we have collected our sticks.  Dropped in to window shop wistfully at the brick and mortar.  Sniffed our cigars as they age peacefully in their winter sleep.

But finally, today, today Spring is in the air my friends.  The sun is finally shining and the weekend is just off on the horizon.  Winter dreams of deep drams and rich smoke will soon awaken and I will, after long last, enjoy some smoke.

He has legal custody of his daughter and had been allowing the child's mother visitation rights.  Mom is a drug addict with a lengthy criminal record, but she had appeared to have gotten herself cleaned up and her life in order, which is why my friend allowed the visitation.  A couple of months ago, his daughter went with mom and never came back.  The kid is only 6 but knew enough to sneak away and sneak phone calls to her dad without mom knowing.  Unfortunately she was never quite able to explain where it was she was staying, and the only information my buddy had was the moms cell phone number.  He went to court and got charges filed, the judge issued a warrant, but the police department refused to look for her not believing that the child was in any immediate danger.  Custodial kidnapping is not treated the same as any other kidnapping.  The police even told my buddy that they just planned on waiting to catch the mother in a motor vehicle stop, which made no sense at all because the mother does not have a car or drive.  What happened next was just genius.  My buddy decided that he had had enough of dealing with the local PD and would take matters into his own hands.  Knowing the mothers cell phone number, due to his daughter sneaking phone calls to dad when mom wasn't looking, he started calling moms cell phone and leaving messages every couple of minutes....until her voice mail box was full.  Then he would keep calling until the voice mail picked up again and continued to fill it with messages to return his daughter.  Eventually, Fter several days of this, the mother got frustrated and tried to get calls from him blocked.  She called the police and tried to file harassment charges against him!  Of course she showed up in their database with a warrant, called my buddy, and escorted him to where she was staying.  With a police escort my buddy went into the home, scooped up his daughter and walked out of the house.  The last thing he saw as he put his baby in the car was the screaming mother resisting arrest and getting face planted in the front yard. He brought her home last night. 

To celebrate, I cracked a bottle of gentleman jack and started passing around the humidor.  Had my very first under crown, which came in my latest haul, as well as my first Oliva serie V and a Man O war Virtue.  My wife had an Acid Blondie.  A good chunk of my Alec Bradley seconds disappeared.  When I head up to see my buddy at the end of the month, I plan on repeating this ceremony with a trip to a local shop called Cup O Joes in NY and letting him pick out whatever he wants on my dime.  Might even buy him his first humidor and a couple of Drew estate Javas.  He seems to brag about them whenever we talk cigars.

I've heard he was generous, but this is just insane!

A few weeks back, I saw a post in r/pipetobaccomarket by an unassuming user named barkingleopard, it was a strait forward idea; ""my cigars, your pipe tobacco"". At the time, My collection of pipe tobacco was modest and uninteresting, so I instead offered him a strait money for cigar trade. we ultimately agreed that I would pay him $50 and he would send me a good variety of sticks, specifics at his discretion.  after he shipped them, he messaged me saying the shipping was $14.33, this was an omen of things to come. 

when I received the package this morning (via USPS), It seemed rather large and pretty darn heavy, needless to say I made haste to bring it in side and scout out ""the goods"".  Upon opening the box, I saw, not one, nor two, but three gallon ziploc bags filled to the brim with cigars of varying size, shape, color and brand.  I could tell he had overdone it, but by just how much, I wasn't quite sure yet.  

I cleared off a relatively small table in my family room and attempted to lay them all out flat, this proved to be a challenge as the cigars took up too much space! While laying them out, I noticed mixed into the lot, Alec Bradleys, A few Gurkhas and a good selection of Olivas and nubs on top of a Cain and a La Aurora preferido perfecto.  The rest were brands I (in my little experience) were unfamiliar with, ""decent, but not great"" as he described them. While putting them back into their bags, I took a head count and discovered he had sent me 112 cigars that seem to be worth $300+ dollars, all for the measly $50 I sent him.

This man is a god among men, and should be treated thusly.

Sorry! I really don't have a good camera, so I can't post pictures.

You're supposed to be able to find out the sex of the baby somewhere around 16 weeks I think, but the ultrasound folks said it's easier if you wait a few extra weeks.  I'm stupid excited about having a kid and ever since I found out we were expecting, I wanted to do something cool to commerorate the big day.

Before I get much further...[I stole this idea from here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/qt0ga/request_cigars_for_longterm_aging/).  Credit I think goes to Robotsongs and HillbillyThinkTank in the first instance, but also to Zackthestogieman for the extension of the idea because that's the one that appeals to me most.

So the idea that was offered up in the thread above was this:  get a box of 20 cigars, smoke one on the day your child is born, and one on each of their subsequent birthdays.  When the child hits 18, you'll have 2 sticks left: one for you and one for them.  When I read that thread a couple of months ago I instantly loved the idea.  Initially I thought it would only work with a boy, but I've come to the conclusion over the last couple of months that I'm doing this in either scenario.  I started smoking with my wife and I know that there are a few women on here that smoke cigars, so while the chances aren't especially high that she will want to smoke a cigar with her old man (too busy smoking slim menthol cigarettes and telling me what a dick I am I should imagine) I still want to try.  Absolute worst case scenario, I get to enjoy 18 awesome cigars as she grows up and share the 19th and 20th with my lovely wife.  Hardly a downside!

So in that same thread above, jy617 suggested a box of My Father Le Bijous and I thought that was a perfect selection.  It's a box of 23 though, so I'd have 3 spares.  Obviously I could just pull the extras out and smoke them whenever, but it's a special box and I want to keep it that way.  My original plan was to give one to my father in the US, one to my step-father here in Ottawa and one to my father-in-law in England as it goes with the theme.  Problem is none of them smoke cigars and I think that the three sticks would go unsmoked and just left to dry out and crumble.  Since I want these to be enjoyed, my backup plan is to give one to each of my groomsmen from my wedding a few years ago.  I gave them each a personlaized flask filled with Glenfiddich 30 y/o at the actual wedding so it follows a theme and at the very least I know they'll each light these up!

So anyway, we found out today that we're having a boy!  I'm absolutely thrilled, though I guess I'll have to cancel those shotgun orders and start buying up tiny hockey equipment.  In any case, I'm celebrating with [this badboy today](http://imgur.com/kHTri), [here's the scan of our little alien](http://imgur.com/XWQzL) and [here's the box of My Father's](http://imgur.com/urVzg) that I'll be enjoying over the next 18 years!

**TL;DR Having a baby and smoking a stick out of the same box for 18 years..hopefully smoking the last one with the kid on his 18th bday!**

One of those things can be that you end up forgetting why you started smoking cigars in the first place, and having a stick lit at all times can be one of those things you start to do, almost every day.  It isn't a terrible thing but when it ends up affecting how you smoke on your days off, and you find yourself smoking not to enjoy but because it's become a habit, it is a truly awful thing.

Yesterday I finally got over a nasty virus, and smoked my first cigar in probably I'd say 4 days or so.  It tasted amazing.  It was a Nestor Miranda Grand Reserve and I made it last, and everything about it was perfect.  It was a real kick in the nuts honestly, because I realized that for the past 8 months or so I haven't been smoking to enjoy but simply smoking to smoke.

I take this time to reflect and ask that you never forget to savor each stick, and never forget how amazing cigars truly are.

So after smoking for over 15 years now I have inevitably collected various different kinds of inexpensive cigar cutters along the way. I got to thinking that maybe some of our newer members -- or at least new to smoking -- might need one.

This is on me, of course, so don't worry about postage or anything like that, although I'd like to keep this in the US for my wallet's sake. Basically if you want one I'll send one out to you. I've got a few double blades, a few single blades, and one or two v-cuts. Total is around 10 or 11. First come, first serve. 

Man, I hope this isn't a lame idea...

I received word of an estate sale in a very wealthy suburb near Minneapolis. I was surprised to see that among the photos of the items for sale were several humidors with some very rare and interesting cigars pictures. I steeled myself for battle. Having been raised on garage sale clothing and items for my childhood, the ins and outs of estate sales and garaging are engrained.

I get up at the crack of dawn, having packed a breakfast sandwich and a bottle of cold pressed coffee and head out to the sale. The wealth in the area becomes apparent with all the gigantic lake front property. I park the car, get my preliminary entrance number (they meter how many people can go inside at once, it pays to be first) and I am the 4th person in. Score!

I stand outside in the cold talking to the guy that runs the sale. **Apparently** the guy that died was some a writer or editor for Cigar Aficionado!!!!! So I heard. His best friend already got half of his cigars and the rest were up for sale.

When the doors open there is a mad rush for the humidors and smokes. There were whole tables full of humidors and cigar boxes (which were full) and accessories. Rare ones, hard to find ones. This jackass dealer, interested in cigars only as a commodity to be resold for more money, starts tagging entire humidors. I snag what I can. It turns out I got the best deal because...

The staff looks at this guy and goes ""Hey, you tagged the humidor itself, we're still charging by the stick. You just tagged a few thousand dollars in cigars bro."" The guy goes pale, realizing he has no idea what he is doing he puts everything back. Punk!

MEANWHILE I snag the choice stuff, picking out what looked good and an entire humidor and all the sticks in it.

They were asking for about $4 per stick **any stick** and in Minnesota with a 70% wholesale tax, that is a huge discount anyway. And they're good sticks!

They add up my humidor, my new BLACK-OPS lighter, Ashtray, a rare CigarFest 2012 Colibri cutter, a new fresh can of Xikar Butane, a  box of tiny cigarillos and..as it turns out.....*drum roll* 88 choice cigars from inside the humidor. For $312...

[Here is the album](http://imgur.com/a/CkznM/)

I get home, nearly jumping up and down with joy and take an inventory. It was so rushed I never even looked inside the humidor. What was inside blew me away.

* 22 Unbanded sticks (Probably R.P. Series D Factory Seconds)
* 1 Liga Privada No.9 Cigar Rights Association Edition
* 6 Rocky Patel Edge Sumatras
* 3 Rocky Patel Edge Maduros
* 18 Rocky Patel 50th Anniversary Nordings (big ones)
* 12 Rocky Patel Fifteenth Anniversaries
* 12 Rocky Patel Series D Overruns (in packaging)
* 4 Rocky Patel Old World Reserves
* 10 Rocky Patel Decades
* Alta Gracia Cigarillos
* Road Warrior Ashtray
* Xikar Butane
* Black-Ops Kilo lighter
* La Aurora CigarFest 2012 Colibri CUT
* Thompson Three Finger Case
* Glass Top 80 count humidor, no locking key, busted hinges but solid seal.

For $312. I did some price checking and rough math, and factoring in the MN tax, this was actually **$1142.30** in cigars!!!!!!

SCORE! Now, not being a capitalist douche bag estate sale profiteer, I will be sharing this bounty with my friends and with my BotL. PREPARE TO BE CIGAR-BOMBED.

As some of you may know, I represent a smaller cigar brand, and I will start by saying that this post has nothing to do with that brand, nor an attempt at persuading you to buy our cigars. (I'll do that another time, ha ha)

I see A LOT of posts on here about such and such deal, or such and such discount, and website, bid this, bid that, etc. etc. etc......and I simply just wanted to urge everyone to consider seeking out your local retailer, brick and mortar store, and supporting that local business.  Most of these retailers hold a true passion for cigars and the industry, and if you spend 5 minutes with them, it will shine through.  My experience as a prior consumer, was that the benefits of spending my dollars in these local shops, far out-weighed buying my cigars online (which I had done in the past...guilty).  

This wasn't a heavy hearted post.  I just wanted to create some conversation and awareness.  Support your local retailers if possible.   Trust me.....sit down with a tobacconist that has put his money on the line to open a retail store, and you will be glad you did.  (of course there are exceptions to all of this, unfortunately)

Hope all are well.  Keep smokin'.  ",,False,self,t5_2r090,False,,,True,t3_1cm0ev,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1cm0ev/possibly_and_unpopular_post_in_this_forum/,

I bought a box of Shorty's a month ago and couldn't wait to try them out.  I like a stout spicy cigar but I was nowhere near prepared for the 'punch' these things pack.  The box gives a ""you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll hurl and YOU'RE GONNA DIE"" type of description on the inside.  Ya, ya, ya, it's a really strong spicy cigar, I get it!  

I.... didn't get it....  

Warning: I just started smoking cigars less than a year ago and I am nowhere near seasoned enough to write a proper review.  The following is a description of the events that happened on the night of November 29th, 2012. Viewer discretion is advised. 

When I went to light the cigar I just touched the tip of my tongue to it.  Wow, that's actually spicy.  My tongue is tingling.  Ok, now it's actually kind of burning.  Interesting... Light it up and a few puffs into it and my lips are burning and my mouth is on fire.  It's almost as if this were wrapped in habanero leaves. 

I had to sit it down for a few minutes to gather my thoughts.  What the hell is this?  My mouth is on fire... I went inside and looked in the mirror and my lips were bright red.  I took a couple of deep breaths and decided to see if I could muster through it.  

Reluctantly, I did. I mean hell, I bought a whole box, I have to get at least through 1/3 of one of them right? 

The first third was really creamy from what I could tell.  My mouth and tongue were on fire and pretty numb at this point.  Adrenaline started kicking in and my mind wasn't focused on flavor.  I was just looking at the cigar and thinking to myself what the hell this thing was. Right away it started burning down one side.   

The second third I was getting a little worried. The burn was getting worse and I couldn't rectify the situation.  The creaminess went away but nothing else really came through.  My mouth finally started to settle down a bit.  

The third third really had a nice earthy spice flavor to it as far as I could tell.  I think my taste buds were finally actually tasting something besides burning. The burn issues continued and by the time I was done with it, it looked like I was smoking half of a fiery canoe.  My mouth was numb but not on fire anymore but my nose was running and my face was sweating.  

All in all, it was a really different experience than I am used to.  Normally I relax and browse /r/cigars while I am smoking.  I didn't even once think to get my phone out.  I was in pain and just wanting for this to be over. 

TL;DR Tonight I ate a handful of Guatemalan Insanity Peppers and spoke to a Coyote named Johnny Cash.

1363000061.0,59,self.cigars,1a2r4x,PSA: Learning how to spot fake Cuban cigars and how to handle non-cigar smoking friends/family buying you cigars on vacation,brutus2600,70,11,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1a2r4x/psa_learning_how_to_spot_fake_cuban_cigars_and/,"Ok /r/cigars, it appears we've had a rash of fake Cubans coming into our possession recently. I'd like to take a minute or two of your time to go over how to learn to spot a fake Cuban cigar and what to do if you have a friend or family member going abroad who might be buying you some Cubans.

First, let's go over how to tell a fake Cuban cigar. Unfortunately for many of us we don't have the possibility of just going and viewing and comparing real Cubans to fake Cubans. The good news is some people do, and they've posted about it all over the internet. Some of the most useful links I've found are as follows:

* [Cuban Cigar Website](http://www.cubancigarwebsite.com/fakes.htm) - This is one of the most useful Cuban cigar reference sites out there, and lo and behold they also have an extensive area about fakes. Read up :)
* [How the seal should look](http://www.thefinerlife.com/smokers_conner/cuban_seal.htm) - Here are some great details and pictures of the seal. If the artwork and box look good, check out the details on the seal. IF THE SEAL IS LOOSE IN THE BOX BUT LOOKS REAL - IT'S STILL A FAKE. Real Cubans will always have the seal affixed to the box
* [Another useful overview with some helpful pictures](http://www.dutyfreecubancigars.com/fakes.htm)
* [Lastly, a gallery of fake Cubans from Cigar Aficionado](http://www.cigaraficionado.com/counterfeit)

As a side note, Cuban cigar manufacturing isn't as strict and down to a science as you might think. Sometimes there are variations in band colors or embossing. Now comes into play the question of origin. Always purchase your Cubans from a distributor that you trust. If you get something that seems a little off but you trust the distributor - you're probably ok. If they're reputable they'll gladly take your concerns into consideration.

**Now how do you deal with somebody buying Cubans for you?**

So many people have had their friends or family who don't smoke cigars go on vacation and come back with a beautiful glass top box of Cohibas for their favorite cigar-smoking friend, you. How do you tell them thanks but they're fake? Hopefully you took some steps before hand and never have to deal with this situation at all.

* If you have any inkling that they might buy cigars but they don't know the first thing about cigars, the best thing to do is just tell them not to buy you anything. All of the cigars sold on docks of cruise ship ports are fake. Most of the cigars in stores all over the place are fake. So unless they know what they're looking for, chances are they're buying fake cigars.
* If they insist on buying you cigars, research where they're going and see if there is a [La Casa del Habano](http://www.lacasadelhabano.com/web/index.php) retailer in that area. This will be their only hope of being sure they're buying the real thing.
* If they **do** smoke cigars, do them a favor and educate them about fakes with the above links. You don't want them spending good money on bad cigars, or worse actually smoking those cigars.

Lastly - even if they're fakes, they're still illegal to bring into the US, there isn't a ""one box"" limit, and taking the bands off is still a risky move. Cuban cigars are still 100% illegal to bring into the US no matter what you've heard.

Hopefully this alleviates some of the fake issues we've been having lately. If you have any questions, feel free to ask. I'll do my best to answer them :)

So much has happened over the months, good and bad. But now, it's that time again. Time to sit back, to relax and reflect on the times. 

Tomorrow is Christmas eve, my favorite day of the year. I get to see all my family. It's rare that we all get together, so I cherish it. People are getting older, friends are moving away, things are changing. You never know who will be there next year, and who won't. Take this time to enjoy the company of others. Looking back, there are things I should've done but didn't. People I should've made the time to see, but didn't. But just remember, things will always get better. 

If work or school has been kicking your ass (like it has been doing to me), take an hour or two, and spark up your favorite smoke. Relax. Right now, I'm actually *enjoying* a cigar for the first time in a long time. And guys, lemme tell ya, it's awesome. My shopping is done, my affairs are in order. I have no worries. 

r/cigars has grown immensely over the past year, it's amazing. I remember us being a small group of only 600. But something happened, more people came in and saw what we were. The sense of community here is unmatched. I fell in love with it and couldn't get enough. I'm sure many of you feel the same way, and that's what keeps you coming back. 

To all of you guys, my fellow BOTL, friends I've never met, I wish you the best. I hope you have a great holiday and a happy New Year!

Yours truly,

    We go to great lengths to match our cigars to our surroundings. We try pair our cigars with fitting music, the perfect beverage, and relaxing surroundings.    
    The summer is now upon us. The weather is getting warmer and we are smoking outside with the aroma of summer enveloping us. The fresh green leaves on the trees, freshly bloomed flowers, and freshly cut green grass are all around us. Why not pair a cigar with this environment?    
    Sadly, there is not a specific cigar that can embody the essence of summer. However, there is a breed of cigars that can. It is something you have seen when you browsed your B&amp;M's stock but you may have been apprehensive about purchasing one because it seemed like a novelty. Those of you who have smoked one will agree that these cigars are summer in a stick.    
    There will be no specific cigar of the month this month. Such would prevent many people from being able to enjoy it. Instead, there will be a wrapper.    
    With the power vested in me by my fellow Botl's I declare...     
     
**THE SUMMER OF THE CANDELA **    
    
Packed with sweet floral and creamy grassy notes, the candela wrapper is the embodiment of summer.    
    I don't care what brand your cigar is, what size it is, what shape it is, or how much it costs.    
    So go to your B&amp;M, grab a green cigar, and give the candela a try.    
    
Your aficionado of the month,

I thought why don't I grab the weiner dog and bike to the park about a mile away from my house. I figured it was as good as any morning would be for a stick for breakfast so I went into a humi and grabbed a LP A. 

I threw the dog in the backpack (don't worry, she loves it and is strapped to my chest like a damn baby) biked about a mile, unload the little turd machine so she could run around and bark at air, cut &amp; toast up a LP A. 15 minutes go by and two kids about 8-11 years old come strolling through the park, come up to me and ask if they can pet the puppah. I hate herfing around kids but it was 0730 and a rare morning off so WTF.

One of the young lads asks me what I am smoking. I reply, ""why a cigar."" The young man replies back, ""That aint no cigar. My daddys Philly Blunts don't look nuthin like that. Why you lying Mister?""  I chuckle, inside laughing my ass off, and they go on their merry way and the dog is now 8 feet from the parks garbage can that she is barking her non-existant balls off at is if it was R2D2 coming after her.

I figured a reddit pic was in order to document this, in my mind, hilarious morning.  Thought I would share and maybe somebody else would get a chuckle out of it.

Good Luck!


EDIT - To clarify

-tools allowed

-bigger/fatter cigars don't matter, it comes down to having the shortest cigar at the end. 

-Open to anyone 

-medical bills are not my problem. 

EDIT 2 - If it looks like you snip the cap then light it, your picture will not count. I want this to be as fair as possible, and if the end is perfectly cut with only a bit of ash, it will look fake. Such as [this] (http://i.imgur.com/CqcEEiL.jpg)

I'm just giving this as a pretext to better understand the story. I'm from Pittsburgh, but I'm currently a student living about four hours away in Gettysburg. Around 4 o'clock, I got a call from my dad telling me that my 86-year-old grandmother had passed away this morning. After class, I went over to the local cigar club to have a smoke and get my mind off of things. Figuring I'd smoke something special as a sort of memorial for my gram, I picked up a Padron anniversary, about a $24 stick. Great cigar, but that's not the point. After about an hour of hanging out, a group of Marines came into the shop after a day of visiting the battlefields. So, naturally, I strike up a conversation with this Marine named Ed, talking about the college, his military career, etc., and somehow my grandma came up in the conversation. Well, Ed goes over to the humidor and asks me what I smoke. After him insisting a few times, I tell him that the Cubano Limitado is a great cigar, so he goes over and just buys one for each of us. I was really touched by the gesture, and thanked him as he left. No more than five minutes later, two more Marines, Daniel and Anthony, walk in. The conversation goes pretty much the same way, discussing politics, our lives, etc. Well I get up for about a minute to use the bathroom and come back to find another Padron anniversary sitting in front of me. I'm just absolutely shocked by the kindness and humility that these men showed in trying to show a little sympathy for a complete stranger that they had just met, and for all they know could be lying. When I thanked them for their generosity, they simply insisted that it was my tax dollars at work, so there was no need to thank them. Now, I've always had a sense of loyalty and love for my country, but I can honestly say that I have never felt more patriotic than at this moment when I write this post. The selflessness and generosity that these men showed not only in that cigar club, but in risking their lives to protect my country while maintaining such a level of genuine humility has left me utterly speechless, and given me anew appreciation for what it means to serve and be a great human being. I can't begin to thank them, and all the other brave men and women who have served my country loyally, enough. They took a tragedy in my life, and helped to turn it into one of the best memories of human decency that I could ever hope to have. So, thank you guys out there in uniforms. Thank you Ed, Daniel, and Anthony. Finally, thank you all for reading.

I've been lurking here for a while and have been getting more into cigars, so I recently bought a humidor and a humidifier from amazon and a cheap bundle of cigars from cigars international.  I took the advice from this subreddit; I let the cigars age in my humidor (after properly seasoning it of course), I lit the aged cigar without letting the flame come in contact with the cigar, and I took my time smoking it.

It's been a while since I've been active with the sub for a number of different reasons, both personal and others relevant to r/cigars. 

One thing that makes it tough to come back is the circle jerk mentality we seem to have adopted lately when it comes to trying new cigars. You probably know where I'm going with this, as it's been brought up before. There are other cigars out there to smoke besides Liga Privadas and Opus X. Seriously. There are tons of absolutely phenomenal smokes that aren't made by DE or don't have a large X on the fancy band. 

There was a post recently about a guy taking a trip to a B&amp;M and he asked which LP he should by as if they were the only line of cigars they carried. How can you limit your experience to just 1 stick like that? 

The mods have been doing a great job about molding our traditions to fit the growth of our sub, but the pictures of Undercrowns and threads about how other cigars are awful make this place very unappealing to someone who's been around here. 

Try a new stick the next time you go to your B&amp;M. I swear, you'll be wildly impressed with the variety.

This month's edition is to give thanks to your favorite cigar company!!! How do you do that? By sending one or more of their cigars that you absolutely love!  Make sure you include a note telling them what that cigar is and maybe explain some things about that cigar/s!

**Rules:**

- Keep all shipping details between you and your trade partner
- Message your partner ASAP to set up trade parameters.
- Send at least 1 cigar! (But everyone automagically seems to send a metric shit ton)
- Do not screw your trade partner over. BakersGonnaBake will stop baking and then everyone is SCREWED!


*If you are not on this list you probably did not sign up in time or I forgot about you or you didn't have a plus.*

After a few hours toiling over a hot keyboard, I can finally give /u/Bitaemo and /u/dlm04e a break from dealing with bomb list requests and updates.

This is part one of our r/cigars Dashboard that will give our community a number of new features.  I want to thank /u/nowgetbacktowork as well as /u/ngmcs8203, /u/MisterBastahrd, /u/avrus, /u/Bitaemo, and /u/dlm04e for their help with testing and suggestions.

Please note that this is not at all the final product, but it is functional, so I wanted to bring it to your attention.

You may access the site at http://rcigars.whileone.com .  I know we setup those PINs with CigarBot, but fuck it, you won't need em.  You will sign in via reddit, so make sure you're logged into the correct account (I know you assholes have alts).  After logging in, click on Manage Addresses.

On the Address Management screen you should see your username, verification status, as well as any addresses currently in the system.  From here you can create addresses, edit addresses, delete addresses, and if you're verified you can get access to the Search function from this screen.

**NOTE:** All addresses that were imported into the system were set to inactive by default.  If you wish for your address to be visible when someone searches for your username, you must mark one of your addresses as active.  Click ""Edit"" on the address of your choice, check the active box, and click ""Update Address"".  Only one address may be active at a time.

If you're going on vacation, or otherwise wish to hide your address without deleting the record, you may edit the address and uncheck the active box.  Without an active address, you will not be visible in the Search function.

Just to recap:

* Go here: http://rcigars.whileone.com
* You don't need that PIN you got previously
* You have to mark your address as active to show up on the search
* You can hide your address by marking it as inactive

Finally, this app is running on a shared server (for now) that does like to kill the process within a few minutes of idle activity, so if you find the site unresponsive, go back to http://rcigars.whileone.com .  It can take a few seconds to start up.  If this doesn't resolve the issue, or you find any other issues, please send me a PM.

Before we set it up, I want some feedback on how to make this run the best it can as well as see how interested the community will be.  I ran this giveaway on Leaf &amp; Flame with one humidor a few months ago and we received 181 amazing cigars... I have very high hopes for doing it on /r/Cigars!

----

**What is a Build'A'Humidor Giveaway?**

Essentially, you send in cigars, and in return you receive entries.  These cigars will go into two humidors, and after the giveaway is over, we will randomly select two winners to receive a humidor filled with cigars that you sent in - a pseudo-lottery.

While one humidor will be a 50 count desktop that I am providing, we are currently obtaining a *very nice* humidor from a sponsor.  When we find out the final details we will surprise the community on June 15th when the giveaway begins.

----

**Cigars as entries**
----

There will be a possibility of receiving 15 entries.  You will be able to send in a maximum of five cigars, and the entries are determined by cigar MSRP.

- $5-$10 cigars will be worth 1 entry

- $11 and up cigars will be worth 2 entries

- Anything that we determine to be very special/rare will be 3 entries

We will create a list of several brands that won't be allowed (i.e. Gurkha due to MSRP mark-up  and flavored due to tainting of humidor).

In order to stay as fair as possible, before you send the cigars you will need to let us know the contents of what you are sending.  We will be able to tell you how many entries you will receive before you send them.

**IF YOU SEND CRACKED, BROKEN, DAMAGED, DRY, GROSS, CIGAR/S** they will be tossed and not count as an entry - so make sure you ship them well (I suggest putting them in a baggy with a humidification pillow/pack, cushioning the inside of a small box).

----

**Extras**
----

- We will be allowing non-US members to join but they will need to cover any shipping expenses

- While you are free to send cigars from your humidor, purchasing online and having the company ship direct is an option

- For non [+] members, participating in this giveaway (w/ successful packaging) will earn you a [+]

- Mods are not eligible for entry

- Mods are not liable for **anything**

Please leave suggestions below as we want this to run as smoothly as possible!  If you have any questions/comments/concerns leave them below and I will answer them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

When you decide to trade you are free to lay-out the standards of the trade. You can agree to the number of sticks,  a value range, or even say every single stick that you are trading. If your partner says “hey, I think a blind trade would be fun. . lets just do that” you can explain your concern of getting shafted and I don’t think anyone would have a problem with accommodating you. If you have a trade that you really think wasn’t fair speak up about it to your partner. I believe that no one would intentionally shaft a member here, and would be willing to rectify the situation. Also, if two members that completed a trade are both happy with it, why be an ass and say “Man, that’s an awful trade.” Maybe they don’t share your taste but they are happy with the results so just leave it alone. The way not to handle the situation is to make a throwaway and then complain while offering absolutely no solutions to help fix the problem.

1375721622.0,51,self.cigars,1jqzi7,Complete overview of the new trade system,SpeedGeek,63,12,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1jqzi7/complete_overview_of_the_new_trade_system/,"Since Friday, there have been a couple of glitches that I've ironed out, and a few more to take care of this week, but overall the [new trade system](http://rcigars.whileone.com) appears to be working well.  I wanted to take a moment and go over the Trade Management screen and the functionality that we've built into it for you.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/lkHqrJT.png)

Starting at the top of your screen, you'll see your username, verified status, and trade and bomb 'scores' for your account.  Under that is the Active Trades section.  Each trade is split up by color each with an Outbound and Inbound component (except bomb trades, which only have outbound).

Verified users may click on their trade partner's name to be directed to their address page.  **Unverified users must contact their trade partner to find out their address and discuss the specifics of the verification trade.**

After the sender and recipient columns, you have a Type column.  This will list the trade type (Verification, Standard Trade, Bomb, or Blind Trade).  Bombs will have a trade code in parentheses that you are to include with your shipment so that your recipient can give you credit for your destruction.

Then you have shipment information.  If your partner has shipped, you'll see the time they marked it as shipped and tracking info they entered.  If you have shipped, you'll click ""Mark Shipment Sent"" and the system will ask for a tracking number.  If you make a mistake entering the tracking number you can re-enter it by clicking again.  Your trade partner will be notified (except in the case of bomb trades) of the fact that you have shipped and the tracking number associated with the shipment.

**Unless otherwise decided between the trade partners, ALL trades must have tracking.**  If the trade partners have decided on no tracking, place ""No Tracking"" in the prompt.  If you did not discuss tracking with your partner, and they put ""No Tracking"" or provide a tracking number that is invalid or nonexistent, please contact the mods.

Next is the received column.  Same as the shipped column, you'll see whether or not your partner has received your package.  If you've received a package, click the appropriate ""Mark As Received"" link and the system will ask you to confirm that you have indeed received your package.  Once your trade partner marks your package as received, you will receive credit for the trade.  When both sides have marked as completed, the trade is done and will no longer show on the Active Trades window.  **If you have any issues with your trade, or receive an unacceptable package, click the Contact Mods link for the associated trade and enter a detailed message.**  We'll review complaints and come to a solution.

If you need to cancel your trade, you can click the ""Cancel Trade"" link in the final column.  A few stipulations:

* In all active trades other than Bomb trades, your partner must agree to cancel the trade as well.
* You cannot cancel a Bomb trade that has already been shipped (why would you want to?).  Contact the mods if you have any issues.
* You cannot cancel out of a blind trade.

If your partner has requested to cancel the trade, you'll see that in the field on your Inbound portion of the trade.

Under the Active Trades screen you have Pending Trades (requests that you have sent out) and Trade Requests (requests that have been sent to you).  You can accept or deny trade requests, and you can cancel pending trades.  Fairly straightforward.

At the bottom are your navigation links, including the ability to sign up for verification trades (both for unverified and verified users), make a trade request (or send a bomb trade), and enter a trade code for a bomb trade you have received.

----
**TL;DR- The new trade system is pretty easy to understand.**


If you have any specific questions, I'll be happy to answer them.  Also, suggestions for future functionality are always welcome.  In the coming months we hope to smooth this out and also provide a few more tie ins with the subreddit here so your 'scores' are reflected appropriately.

You did it to yourselves.,MisterBastahrd,70,16,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/z8iyw/i_am_the_aotm_you_did_it_to_yourselves/,"Alright, so I'm in Dallas after having evacuated from the hurricane on a nice Wednesday afternoon, when I decide to pop into the IRC channel.  People inform me that I'm (at the time) winning the AoTM contest.  My first reaction is ""I didn't even know that was going on"" and my second was ""I'm way too low key to win because I'm not a karma whore who records his cluelessness on Youtube for posterity.""

But somehow the sea parted, the grass grew, I became wrong for the first time in my life, and I have decided to carry two stone tablets of pure awesome to smite you all with or something.  I can promise I won't become a pompous asshole like some of the previous AoTMs because I pretty much perfected that art a long time ago.  It comes naturally.  But what I will do is tell you what the CoTM(s) will be.

Yes, CoTMs.  See, here's the thing: we have an international community here, but we have a primarily domestic reach.  If I wanted to nominate a Cuban cigar for CoTM, it would not be fair to US residents because they would have to import them illegally.  And likewise, it would not be fair to people outside the US because they do not have easy access to these cigars.  And since this is my show....

For US residents, the CoTM is the El Cobre by Oliva.  I slaved over this choice for about a quarter second.  I have generally disliked the CoTMs that have gone towards the super-strong sticks because they aren't noob-friendly, but the difference with this super-strong stick is that there isn't a ton of hype around it.  It doesn't have a fuse for a cap, and isn't made by some boutique that releases 5 cigars a decade.  It is a strong, flavorful, tasty cigar that deserves more respect than it has been given and is one of the best values on the market.

The international CoTM is the Romeo y Julieta Cazadores.   It is one of my go-to cigars when I want that Cuban profile but don't want to be lulled to sleep by Cuban tobacco's comparative mildness.

So, there you go.  Let it never be said that I have failed to be magnanimous.  Now get off my lawn.",,False,self,t5_2r090,False,,,True,t3_z8iyw,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/z8iyw/i_am_the_aotm_you_did_it_to_yourselves/,

So it seems I'm off to a good start; hopefully I can keep it up! I just felt like sharing my sudden ambition with my fellow BOTL and SOTL. Wish me luck, and as always, happy smoking!
