Now seems a good as a time as any to make a proper list of what people need. 

For some reason, I wrote all this out without even knowing that there was a character limit which is so happens that I am over by about 6 times. So Sadly, I will have to split this into 7 sections. I will ask that you do not reply to the main article or any of it's sections. Instead reply to someone else. I want to keep the article in it's own entity if you will. Thanks!

I will mention that this is just my personal list that I use to detail cars. I have used many different products and these are what I feel the top players in each category. If you like other products that's fine, please list them in the comments if you like. It does me nor anyone else here any good to keep a secret about what products you like. When I first started I didn't know about any of these products. Word of mouth is a great thing.

Some of the products mention here will not work for some casual ""detailers"" simply because of the size that they are in so just be aware of that. There are definitively alternatives to some of the gallons sizes products that I mention below.

Third, half way through this I figured I will just add affiliate links to this. In total this took close to 10 hours to make, it's almost 8,000 words and it's 30 pages in word. I just like to mention that hear instead of someone saying that I’m “sneaky” or what not. Like I said, this idea didn’t even come up until I already started to write this article so just to be clear my main intent in this article is to inform and not to make a measly dollar off a $30 compound you bought. I also will not change my opinion on what I like just because [Detailed Image](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com) does not carry it; that would be cheating you out of a great product. If I don’t make a dollar off Brown Royal or the microfiber towels you bought so be it, at least you have a product that works and that is my main goal with this article.

Now, let’s get on to the list!!!

These are the following types of products I will be listing today (in alphabetical order):

* All Purpose Cleaner

* Bucket

* Clay

* Clay Lube

* Compound

* Drying Towel

* Dual Action Polisher

* Dual Action Polisher Backing Plate

* Engine Detail Brush

* Exterior Trim Dressing

* Extractor

* Grit Guard

* Interior Protectant

* Leather

* Leather Brush

* Metal Polish

* Microfiber Towels

* Pads

* Rinseless Wash

* Tire Brush

* Tire Dressing Applicator

* Tire/Wheel &amp; Engine Cleaner

* Tire &amp; Engine Shine

* Wash

* Washing Media

* Wax

* Wax Applicators

* Wheel Brush

* Window Cleaner

Alright, here we go!

**All Purpose Cleaner**

[Meguiar's All Purpose Cleaner Plus D103](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Meguiars-M43/All-Purpose-Cleaner-Plus-D103-P385/128-oz-S1/)

http://img129.imageshack.us/img129/4125/megsd103lrgbc8.jpg

An All Purpose Cleaner is more commonly known as APC. The specific one I am referring to is called APC+. APC+ is exactly what it says (for the most part) which is a general cleaner. For example, I use it mainly to clean the interiors and sometimes the engine now and then. Some people use it to clean tires as well. Some people say that APC+ will clean leather and maybe even paint if diluted properly. I generally dilute APC+ 1:10 for interior which means I would get a total of 11 gallons of APC+. Other surfaces like leather might be 1:15 or maybe stubborn interior spots could be 1:4 to make APC+ Stronger.


**Bucket**

http://imagethumbnails.milo.com/024/917/651/trimmed/24917120_28175651_trimmed.jpg

You can generally find this bucket at Home Depot. I really like this bucket because of its measurements, soft handle, lid, and it also fits the Grit Guard perfectly. There really is not much to say about a bucket, but I really do like this bucket because of the previous things I mentioned. Let's stop talking about buckets now.


**Clay**

[Mothers California Gold Clay Bar System](http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-07240-California-Gold-System/dp/B0002U2V1Y) 

http://image.eurotuner.com/f/images/24969103/eurp_0908_08_z%2Bmothers_clay_bar%2Bfull_view.jpg

This is a good general clay that you can also buy at any auto parts store. I like this clay because it is easy to mold and it's not too soft so it doesn't just pass over embedded particles and it's not too soft that it will destroy your paint. Let me point out though, that I am a firm believer in that if you clay a car it should be polished as I've seen scratches after clay regardless of what clay, lube or pressure you use. This kit like most kits also comes with some clay lube/quick detailer and a microfiber cloth. I could also mention some other new ""clay like"" inventions like the Speedy Prep Towel, but I rather just keep this simple for now.


**Clay Lube**

[Dodo Juice Born Slippy Clay Lube Concentrate](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Dodo-Juice-M35/Born-Slippy-Clay-Bar-Lube-P326/250-ml-S1/)

http://www.cleanyourcar.co.uk/images/uploads/watermarked/dodo-born-slippy-conc.jpg

While the Mothers Clay Bar System comes with clay lube, I believe that the Dodo Juice Born Slippy does a better job. It's much slicker and if you clay frequently you will run out of the quick detailer sooner or later. This product is also specifically meant for clay lube whereas the quick detailer is just a touch up when you need to clean a part of your car and using it as a clay lube is just another side benefit. Born Slippy also smells really good! I've convince people to come close to drink it before.


**Compound** 

[Meguiar's Ultra-Cut Compound M105](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Meguiars-M43/Ultra-Cut-Compound-M105-P388/32-oz-S1/)

http://www.detailersdomain.com/assets/images/megm105.jpg

[Menzerna Super Intensive Polish SI 1500](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Menzerna-M10/Super-Intensive-Polish-PO83-P124/32-oz-S1/)

http://www.detailersdomain.com/assets/images/menzernasi1500pt.jpg

[Meguiar's Foam Cut Compound M101](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Meguiars-M43/Foam-Cut-Compound-M101-P715/32-oz-S1/)

http://www.detailing.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/5e06319eda06f020e43594a9c230972d/m/e/meg-m101.jpg

[Menzerna Fast Gloss 400 Compound](http://www.detailedimage.com/wax.php?id=12162&amp;url=detailedimage.com/Menzerna-M10/Fast-Gloss-400-Compound-P688/16-oz-S1/)

http://www.oldetownautospa.ca/assets/images/menzernafg400qt.jpg

As you can see I have listed 4 different products. For the most part they all do the same thing which is remove severe defects in the paint. For the Meguiar's side you have M105 and M101 whereas on the Menzerna side you have SIP 1500 and FG400. M105 compares to the SIP 1500, but M105 has a bit more cut. They both finish somewhat nice for a compound, but not LSP (Last Step Product; AKA Wax/Sealant) ready. On the other hand you have these two new compounds that are somewhat of an AIO (All In One) on certain paints which are M101 and FG400 both which finish much better than M105 or the SIP 1500. As far as all these compounds go I believe in order of the most aggressive to least they will come out as M101, M105, SIP 1500 and FG400. I could have added Menzerna Power Gloss, but I feel that that particular compound is almost not needed any more since some of these compounds cut so well and finish much, much better.

Also, for the record, the reason I mentioned both brands is that Meguiar's generally use a technology called SMAT (Super Micro Abrasive Technology) which I believe never breaks down fully where at Menzerna uses DAT (Diminish Abrasive Technology) where you have to break down the polish. This is important because while some paint correct well with Meguiar's it may not work too well with Menzerna or vice versa. This is why I recommend having both products. Now, I am not saying acquire all 4. You should be perfectly find having one product of each brand, just know the limitations of each specific product you are choosing. For example, if you choose FG400 make sure you know that it won't remove scratches as much as SIP 1500.


**Drying Towel** 

[Mothers Microfiber Performance Drying Towel](http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-Microfiber-Performance-Drying-Towel/dp/B001UJB8X8)

http://www.carid.com/images/mothers/car-care/155300.jpg

This is my favorite towel to dry my car with after I ""flood the car"" with the hose and use a leaf blower to dry the majority of the water off. This microfiber towel has a waffle weave which is designed to absorb water. This towel also has a foam core in the middle of the towel so it absorbs much more water than a regular towel. I have used the guzzler and I believe that this towel out performs that towel. The only thing I would improve on is that I wish this towel was a tad bit bigger. I will note that since this towel has a foam core, the towel is somewhat ""stiff"". It caught me off guard when I first used it.

1375371614.0,38,self.AutoDetailing,1jhzt7,What are some lesser-known detailing tricks you have in your back pocket? Let's create a big list.,Mudcrutch,41,3,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1jhzt7/what_are_some_lesserknown_detailing_tricks_you/,"Over the years I have learned a lot of random tips from others. Some might be obvious, others not. Here are some of my favorites.

* Get an air compressor. Great for drying off vehicles and getting in all the crevices/seals, drying polishing/mf pads, and blowing out the interior before cleaning to get in all the hard-to-reach areas, etc.

* Dog hair inside you car? Get a pumice stone (that are used for pedicures) and brush the hair away into a shop vac nozzle. It pulls the hair right out and you instantly suck it all up in the vac.

* Clean glass last. Go in horizontal motions on the interior, and vertical on the exterior. That way if there is streaking you will know which side it is on.

* Before a client picks up a car sit in the drivers seat and look around. Take note of any obvious smudges, etc. and take care of them. Pulling the car out into the sun will also help see any remaining issues.

* Use Chemical Guys Black on Black on the wheel-well plastics. It will make the wheels pop with a nice dark background. (Also works great on black trim, mud flaps, engine bay covers, etc.)

* Use Nanoskin pads instead of claybar. MUCH faster and cost efficient. (Claybar can still be good for small, hard to reach areas however.)

* Apply dots of polish or sealant on sections of the car. That way you can keep working without stopping and reloading the pad every few minutes.

* Ask clients about any areas they think need special attention when they drop the car off. Some people might care more about the stain that you got out of the carpet and couldn't care less if you did a great job correcting the paint!

* If it ain't dirty, don't kill yourself cleaning it! My rookie mistake was taking too long cleaning stuff that was perfectly fine!

The results: http://imgur.com/a/86rIz

Washed and clayed using medium grade nanoskin.  

Compounded with Menzerna PG1000. Followed with Menzerna SF4000.
Waxed it with Meguiar's Ultimate Paste Wax.

The whole job took nearly 8 hours of nonstop working.

The owner was very happy with the results as they had already paid a mobile detailer to fix the car who made 0 difference.

With the help of a lot of great people on this sub (especially /u/Baconzjews11, /u/spellrm, and /u/stealthboy) I have ordered supplies to start my kit.

I am focusing on getting a solid wash kit as the start of my process. I will then expand the kit to include leather care, clay, sealant, and wax. I understand that claying is a big part of the wash process but I wanted to spread my cost a little and decided I would add the clay kit a bit later.

Closing Remarks

Thanks to this great sub-Reddit for introducing me to the world of Auto Detailing. I am only a beginner and only want to get involved in the basics but I am very excited to get started. 

I appreciate all of the help I have received and have enjoyed researching various products and methods. I cannot wait for my supplies to arrive!

Please feel free to offer suggestions, especially on some of my upcoming purchases. I am still trying to research various trim dressings, leather cleaners, clay kits, and waxes. I would gladly take suggestions!

I hope this thread may help others who are starting from scratch!",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,False,,,True,t3_1ihlg1,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1ihlg1/my_first_kit_part_1_car_wash_supplies/,

Thanks to this subreddit I was able to fix up my moms 99 Buick after she had scraped against the garage.  

I had been away at school and my first words when I came home was ""what did you do to the car?"". Never really got a full answer but she scraped the side of the garage while backing out somehow. 

I a meguirs clay bar kit, microfiber towel, a cheap microfiber/terry applicator pad and grip (its like a handheld Velcro thing, it was useless), and meguirs scratch x 2.0. after cleaning up I clayed the area, buffed it with a microfiber pad, scratch x, and a good amount of elbow grease, then wiped off the haze with some more quik detailer. 


This was my first time doing some exterior detailing on a car, and it turned out well. So thanks to this subreddit for giving me something useful to read in my free time, it came in handy!",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,False,,,True,t3_1eoaw8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1eoaw8/fixed_up_my_moms_car_up_after_she_scraped_the/,

Car was bought last week on the cheep as cosmetically is was looking nasty, overdue a service and in need of some TLC

Process

Wheels removed, cleaned, prep, painted.

Jet wash, I know people hate these but I wasn't going to smear chunks of mud about.

Washed - two buckets method

Dodo Juice Basics of Bling Clay Bar and lube

Dodo Juice green paint clean and light mop

3 stage paint correction using DA and Flexipads foams.

Finished with AG SRP and then sealed with AG sealant.

I was shooting for a long lasting finish and not that bothered about popping or gloss

Anyway, this was done with the HF DA with the stock backing plate and their foam pads. The Astro Pneumatics backing plate I ordered was not hook and loop so that was my mistake. First time using a DA for the entire car, only played with one for 10 minutes before.

Steps/Product:
Wash - Used Foammaster foam gun and meguiars deep crystal wash
Clay - chunk of a cheap 160g block from amazon
Polish - CG 3n Nano polish. I used too little, first time with this DA. It introduced some swirls on the hood and this was my fault.
Wax - Mothers synthetic. I need something better than this...

1323499716.0,20,self.AutoDetailing,n77q2,Beginners guide to detailing products: the bare minimum supplies.,spellrm,23,3,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/n77q2/beginners_guide_to_detailing_products_the_bare/,"So I haven't seen much activity here in a while, so I figured I would throw up a basic guide on the bare minimum supplies to get started detailing on the cheap. As a student, I never have much money, so I've been slowly building my arsenal over about a year, and I was always looking for a way to save money. So here is what you need to get good results for minimal investment:

**Washing:**

The first step is always going to be to wash the car. Many people use a bucket, some soap, and a sponge. While this may work, it is often times putting swirls in the paint, making the paint look dull over time. The quality of soap is important too. To minimize the swirls you put into the paint, here is what you want:

* Two Home Depot 5 gallon buckets. (Yes two)
* Your choice between: a microfiber chenille mitt, a 100% sheepskin mitt, ~~or what I like to use a lot, a [grout sponge](http://www.lowes.com/pd_109653-962-K-28P_0__?catalogId=10051&amp;productId=1002329&amp;UserSearch=grout+sponge&amp;Ntt=grout+sponge&amp;N=0&amp;langId=-1&amp;storeId=10151&amp;rpp=24).~~ EDIT: I've witnessed the grout sponge induce a small amount of marring since writing this. I recommend everyone use a microfiber or sheepskin mitt. A microfiber mitt can be had for cheap at Target (Vroom brand) and they work great. I never use sheepskin but if you do, make sure it is 100%. 
* For soap, I like stuff from Meguiar's. Not only can you get it locally, and is pretty cheap, it is great soap. I use the [Gold Class](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-G7101-Class-Shampoo-Gallon/dp/B00068OU7U/ref=sr_1_5?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323492149&amp;sr=1-5) soap, but really any version will work.

**Drying:**

Drying the car is the worst part in my opinion. Whatever you do, DO NOT use bathtowels. Don't even think about it. I have used a ton of drying towels and until recently, never found one that did the job correctly. Here is my favorite drying towel:

* [The Supreme Guzzler](http://www.amazon.com/Supreme-Guzzler-Waffle-Weave-Cobra/dp/B000BC976K/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323491902&amp;sr=8-1).

Now I know I said this was a budget list, but this item is just something you can't skimp on. It is huge, and will soak up every last drop of water and then ask for seconds. Best of all, it won't scratch the paint. Worth every penny.

**Claying:**

A clay bar is used to remove embedded particulates that are stuck to the paint. This includes, road grime, tree sap, and asphalt. Once clayed, the paint will feel silky smooth like glass. This step is crucial to do before any type of wax is put on. You don't want to be rubbing particulates into the paint while waxing. A Meguiar's or Mother's clay kit can be bought locally. Both are virtually (or perhaps actually) the same.

* [Meguir's Clay Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-G1016-Smooth-Surface-Clay/dp/B00063X7KG/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323497232&amp;sr=8-1)
* [Mother's Clay Kit](http://www.amazon.com/Mothers-07240-California-Gold-System/dp/B0002U2V1Y/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364443230&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=mothers+clay+bar)

These kits are great because they come with plenty of clay (seriously, this kit has lasted over a year for me) and even a free microfiber towel and quick detailer.

**Wax:**

The final step. This step is fun and rewarding, but choosing a wax is very subjective. There are some very expensive waxes that are great, some inexpensive waxes that are good, and then some waxes I wouldn't touch with a ten foot pole. Anything from Turtlewax, stay away! Just overall horrible quality. For OTC stuff, I like:

* [Meguiar's NXT Generation Tech Wax 2.0](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Generation-Tech-18-Ounce-Liquid/dp/B0002UQATS/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323497624&amp;sr=1-1)

Goes on easy, comes off even easier. Also, it smells delicious. The kit comes with an applicator and a microfiber towel. Great bang for your buck.

Another wax, that is actually a wax-sealant hybrid is Collinite #845. This stuff is super long lasting. Highly recommend.

* [Collinite #845](http://www.amazon.com/Collinite-Liquid-Insulator-Wax-Combo/dp/B005ZUMLV6/ref=sr_1_1?s=automotive&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1364443411&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=collinite+845)

If you haven't been keeping track of cost yet, I estimate this all costs about $80. Keep in mind that you will likely not have to purchase these items again for a long time. $80 is the cost of getting your car cleaned at one of those hack detailers (Autobell, I'm looking at you!) 2-3 times. 

Remember, this is very bare minimum. Things you still might want to get include:

* Wheel brush and tire shine if you like it.
* APC = All purpose cleaner. I prefer Simple Green.
* Glass cleaner. I prefer Stoner's Invisible Glass.
* Some more microfiber towels. Costco has some OK ones (just make sure you wash them first with a light detergent).

If I think of anything else, I will add it to the list.",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,1366944415.0,,,True,t3_n77q2,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/n77q2/beginners_guide_to_detailing_products_the_bare/,

1361069628.0,16,self.AutoDetailing,18o7hc,What to ask yourself before having your car detailed.,rlc1042,20,4,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/18o7hc/what_to_ask_yourself_before_having_your_car/,"Being informed about service you are acquiring is always a good start, here are some basic yet important questions to ask and have answered about auto detailing. 

First to simply answer the question of what is car detailing? It is more than just a simple quick once over at your neighborhood express car wash. Your basics are covered your car is washed, waxed and cleaned from top to bottom on the outside, however, the difference in having a professional detail your car and you yourself attempting this task are very different. A professional will use multistage operations in order to get your car to the brand new brilliance and shine that it had the day you got it, by using high quality products and time, your cars inside and outside will be brought back to showroom standards. 

How often does a full detail last? Unlike a simple wash that will leave your car looking great for a few days and then wash off, a full professional detail will last on your car much longer. The products that are applied to your car will also in the long run preserve your cars outside aesthetics as well as the inside, so your car will be preserved and ready for the snow and rainy months. 

Sealants: what exactly is this and do I need it? The simple answer is yes! Having a sealant applied to your car basically gives you the glass like shine of a new car. Most professionals use a resin or synthetic wax, this offers your car long term protection for outside elements. Most sealants last five to six months, and having this done every five months will ensure that the paint and exterior of your car is protected and looking great. 

Lastly knowing what to expect in a car detailing package. Not all packages are standard and a professional will most likely need to see your car in person to address what, if any, special steps will be needed to fully protect your car. The basics are always covered however, wash, wax and an inside detail will be your base. Seasonal treatments are always available which will protect you Summer through Winter, with UV rays, harsh cold and rain to snow and tree sap. Depending on when you have your car detailed a professional will be able to tell you what your car needs.

I bought this 323i E36 about 3 years ago, second hand, from an owner who used to use the car on a farm covered in plenty of dirt roads. There were some small touch ups required to sort out the dozens of rock chips, however most of the damage was superficial (swirl marks).

The biggest damage was on the boot of the car, and this required a respray. The car was supposedly rear-ended and the paint shop that painted the boot screwed something up.

For a gallery of the post-wash go [here](http://imgur.com/a/BkDoH).

* AMMO Foam: Very thick, very [green] (http://i.imgur.com/XOm2X7Wh.jpg) soap. Initially I put it into a measuring cup with the intention to dump it into my bucket, it just stuck to the sides of the cup. So I let it set while I did the wheels, do not underestimate the thickness of this soap. The lubricity of this stuff is outstanding, it feels like there is almost nothing between the wash mitt and the paint. It's cleansing power is second to none and it smells good too! I must admit, when I first poured it out into the measuring cup I thought ""Holy shit, this stuff might be radioactive!"" I added one ounce to approximately four gallons of water using a grit guard in a Lowes bucket. Amazing stuff.

* [Dodo Juice Supernatural Mitt A.K.A ""Wookies Fist""](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1kkhi2/teaser_video_of_ammo_foam_with_wookies_mitt/): ""Um... where did all of my water go?"" That statement sums up this mitt pretty much. It sucks up at least half a gallon of water with each dip in the bucket. The fur is outstanding at holding particulate and dirt from the paint and it saved me time and water. I use to do one panel at a time with the microfiber mitt and then wash that said, rinse the next panel down and repeat. With this mitt I was able to complete both doors on a four door car and the rocker panel without having to cleanse the mitt. Because there is no thumb hole it makes it very easy to rotate to a fresh side of the mitt. See the link above for a short video of me using it. Quick note: This is a very high maintenance mitt and its expensive so take caution. When I was done with it I flushed it with water and then shook the hell out of it to get all of the excess water out and fluff it back it up. Then I hung it on a clothes hanger to keep the cuff open and let the water drip away from the mitt.

* AMMO Big Wheel Brush: Sturdy comes to mind when I picked it up. Very heavy, well made. Consists of a wood handle with a chrome baseplate and what I expect to be boars hair bristles. Very useful at cleaning hard to reach areas such as calipers and in between spokes. If I remember correctly, Larry said he had this thing soaking in a bucket for three months to see if it would break and it didn't, and I believe him. I think this thing might be ""buy it for life.""

* AMMO Hydrate: One-of-a kind, created by Larry's chemists. This product was designed to be used with microfiber towels to aid in drying the vehicle and it does just that. When used with microfiber towels, hydrate's chemical properties makes it seem like the water isn't there. The towels just soak it all up and because it has cleansing elements if I missed anything during the wash process the towel just wipes it away clean. Also, if my vehicle isn't filthy Hydrate can be used with a microfiber towel to clean it. The instructions recommend that you rinse the vehicle down and then dry with a towel with Hydrate. I'll definitely be repurchasing this.

* AMMO Microfiber Towels: 300 GSM towels, very awesome. Considering that I was using Autozone towels previously I guess anything is a step up but I digress. When I was drying my vehicle I was able to dry the entire vehicle, expect the roof, and not wring the towel out once. They came in a pack of six and I used three. One for drying, one for glass, and one for claying the car.

* AMMO Interior Conditioner (Mousse): Another outstanding product. I cleaned with leather seats with Lexol according to directions and then let them sit for about 15 minutes to dry. Opening the bottle I was immediately greeted with the smell of leather and a cream color substance that was creamy in nature. I applied it with a microfiber applicator from Mother's and let it sit for about five minutes before touching it. It definitely restored some of the suppleness to the leather and gave it a nice slick finish. Not so slick that I would slide out of the seat, but not so sticky that I couldn't get out of damn thing. I predict that this stuff will last a while as I only used eight lines of about two inches to do all of my seats. Definitely worth buying.

Overall I am very impressed with all of Larry's products. When the bottle says ""Fanatically manufactured in the USA"", they aren't kidding. I think next on my list to purchase will be the Brute wheel soap and the Mud tire gel... the Wolfgang Tire Gel 3.0 just isn't cutting it &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

If there is anything I missed or if you have any questions or want more photos of the AMMO products, please respond and I'll get them to you.

That damn soap... holy shit is it green...

What to do?,shockdroids,16,2,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1k02o3/i_recently_moved_into_an_apartment_for_college_i/,"It has 135k miles and people assume it's brand new.  It has *never* been through an automatic car wash, and aside from a few chips on the hood and below the headlights, the exterior is pristine.  How do I keep it that way?

Aside from wanting to keep it nice just because, I would really like to keep this car for as long as reasonably possible, since I'm not going to be able to get anything nearly as nice for quite a while.  It's a 3.6L V6, 4-Motion and quite frankly I'd take it over a $50,000 CTS any day.  Hypothetically, my dad would probably agree^reluctantly , but what's done is done, right?  :-D

I've been taking it to a nearby spray booth.  That gets *most* of the dirt off, but it does leave behind about as much as you'd expect with just water pressure.  I do have an off-street parking space (no faucet for a hose, though).  Is there a good method for getting the more stubborn grime off, or at least more than I can get off at the spray booth?

**EDIT:**  Thanks for the responses.  The No Rinse solution and Garry Dean's method seem to be precisely the kind of thing I needed.  Much appreciated.  Is there any downside to using the Wash &amp; Wax?  I live in an area such that my car is rather prone to bug splatters, so I'd imagine that would be a good idea.  If it's substantially worse than a conventional waxing, I'll just give it a regular waxing this weekend.  Thanks again.

**EDIT2:** Is there a particular microfiber towel that would be good for my situation?  I see the general consensus is that there *is* a quality differential between cloths, but I'd like to know what factors separate one towel from the next.",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,1376021139.0,,,True,t3_1k02o3,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1k02o3/i_recently_moved_into_an_apartment_for_college_i/,

A friend of mine has been running a mobile detail business for the past 6 years and has a huge client base and reputation built for himself. My goal is to bring these two guys together and build a successful business.

My silent partner has asked me for an extremely high level floor plan by the end of the week to reference in a meeting with his investors. He just wants square footage and basic layout.

I'm completely clueless as to the most efficient way to lay out a shop and would love some advice. He asked me for a minimum requirement and then something more creative.

I'm thinking the minimum requirement is about 1500 square feet with an extremely small customer lobby and restroom, with the rest of the building dedicated to workspace. We would store our equipment in cabinets and shelves along the wall of the shop, and one bay would be separated with a freestanding wall to use as a washbay. I think we'd be able to fit 3 bays but it would be tight. 

The nice-to-have is 1800-2000sq-ft with a very small lobby, restroom, and a small storage room or break room, with the rest of the space dedicated to workspace with a separated washbay. 4 bays including the wash bay would be ideal.

The ultimate wishlist is closer to 2500+ square feet, with a customer lobby large enough for a small coffee area with a sink, sitting area, reception desk and some product display shelves, with some extra wide double doors and enough space to display a car in the lobby. There would be a restroom just past the customer lobby, a storage/break room, and a 4 bay shop.

Here is a little background on our business plan/approach. 

We're located in an *extremely* affluent area with disposable income dripping at the seams. I followed a new 458 up the highway this morning. There are currently no detailing businesses in the area with the skill, experience and reputation that my future partner has developed, so we feel there is an solid market for our quality of work. We will be located within minutes of several high-end repair and modification shops, some of which I already have strong relationships with, and several high end new &amp; used car dealers. Ferrari, Lamborghini, Maserati, Aston, and Porsche are all within 20 minutes.

We plan to pursue partnerships with these businesses and market ourselves by pounding pavement within the enthusiast community. We focus on earning a reputation by the quality of work we do and word-of-mouth, so that in time we become a sought after shop without having to invest much (if any) in marketing. Our services will not be cheap, but we intend to build the reputation as the only place worth taking your $100k+ car.

That's a high level idea. We plan to spend the summer writing the business/marketing plan and building the website, and in the fall we'll start working on nights and weekends to begin building our client base and reputation while the location is being built. It helps that my partner is already booked months in advance.

Anyway, I'd love any suggestions anyone has on how to layout a shop for any of the rough sizes I listed, but especially the smallest one as that presents the biggest challenge.

The owner used to send his cars out to get cleaned and prepared for the lot. He has decided to bring someone in, to use on location. I have a small shop space to work in and some of the supplies are already there.

He asked me during the interview to compile a list of all the products and tools that I would need to do my job. Since he hasn't had a detailer before, we are creating the position and my new job from the ground up.

So, if anyone here could add some input, remind me of things I may have forgotten about.

So far, here's what I've got.

* Shop Vac
* Water blades, shammies
* Microfiber cloths (x30 or so)
* Rags for other stuff, microfiber is more for paint and glass
* Waffle cloths for drying as well (they are awesome!)
* Applicator pads
* A good wax/polish
* Car soap (waxed)
* Dish soap (for removing wax)
* Spray wax
* Clay bar
* Glass cleaner
* All Purpose cleaner / degreaser
* Interior shampoo
* Degreaser
* Vinyl/Rubber/Plastic dressing
* Tire dressing
* Some sort of leather care, cleaner or dressing
* Air freshener
* Chrome polish
* Wheel cleaner / wheel acid
* Steel wool
* Buckets
* Rubber hair brush
* Brushes of various sizes, tooth brushes
* Various buffer pads (he has a buffer)

What am I missing out? I'm not going to be doing anything crazy to the cars. Just basic refreshing, and show car cleans for the lot. Making sure all the cars are presentable and ready to make an impression.

Any input would be much appreciated. Even just tips, or perhaps hyping me up for my new job. I've worked at a VW dealership as an automotive detailer / lot boy, and at Kia for a week. In the summer I clean cars on the side as well.

Thanks for anything and everything!

(Album inside),3step_process,19,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/11w8zn/thanks_to_rautodetailing_i_did_my_first_vehicle/,"I have been lurking for a couple of months soaking up all the knowledge that /r/autodetailing has to offer.  I've had this vehicle for five years and the condition of the paint has steadily deteriorated due to not being garaged and general lack of knowledge by the owner (me).  I really didn't want to (nor could afford) get a new paint job so I set out on a mission to learn everything I could about detailing so that I could try to take care of my own problems.  I read practically every article on the DetailedImage blog and watched many of the videos on Adam's website.  I purchased [this kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0065MYGF2/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00) which contained Meguire's M105 &amp; 205 and [Optimum Opti-Seal](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004S7V7RG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i01) from Amazon.

As you'll see the pictures, the paint was hammered due to my ignorance. The results are definitely not perfect because I truly let it get too far in some areas but it is like a 300% improvement.  I'd like to thank everyone here for all your past comments, I think I've read every post (and comment) on this sub and that knowledge gave me the confidence to take action.

1345851514.0,16,self.AutoDetailing,ys54e,"How I detail: garage - air filter - water softener, etc...",Deckardz,18,2,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/ys54e/how_i_detail_garage_air_filter_water_softener_etc/,"Hi, I just joined and I'm AutoDetailing member number 1000.  Do I win something?  

I'm not a professional detailer, but pretty enthusiastic about it.  I do a lot of research and am familiar with some of the methods layed out here.  

Here's how I detail a car (I own a black car):

1. Take the car to my friend's house because he has a garage that's not full of junk and I've placed all my detailing stuff on his shelves there.  

2. Cycle my friend's water softener.  He has well water that's otherwise hard and would leave water spots.  (And yes, it leads to the outside water hose, unlike in some other houses.)  While the softener cycles I get the supplies ready for the wash and wax job.  This includes setting up five [flourescent (daylight)](http://www.amazon.com/Full-Spectrum-Light-Bulb-Fluorescent/dp/B0018OS06S) [lights](http://www.amazon.com/Coleman-Cable-05961-Brooder-Clamp/dp/B0002YUGCQ/) all around the garage inside to reveal any imperfections and sweeping out the garage floor to make sure there's no dust that can be kicked up, then closing the garage door and turning on a large [true HEPA air filter](http://www.amazon.com/Honeywell-50250-S-99-97%25-Round-Purifier/dp/B00007E7RY) (Home Depot has a black version right now) to remove all dust from the air inside the garage.  

3. Wash the car wheels and car using the [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBo76v2je44) (or three) [bucket method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-M2Cq0RNTs) (see also [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqdEVtOPKAM)) (I like to use [this grit-guard](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grit-Guard-Insert-Yellow/dp/B001SICVAU) ([double-pack](http://www.amazon.com/The-Grit-Guard-Insert-Pack/dp/B008DJQR3Y)), too) and a microfiber mit on an extension wand (like [this](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Premium-Microfiber-Chenille-Mitt-Blue/16817496) but on a pole, it makes it so much easier for the flat-surface majority of the car - I got mine at Walmart) and a hand-microfiber mit or soft sponge from an auto-store to get all the curved parts and crevices.  I use [Meguiar's ultimate soap](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Wash-Wax-48-oz/dp/B00353PWAW) and I do so from the top-down.  Before I wash, I spray the wheels with aluminum-safe wheel cleaner.  

4. Finish the wheel cleaning while the car is still soapy (depending on the heat and how fast the water will dry).  I use that [Bleche-Wite Tire Cleaner](http://www.amazon.com/Black-Magic-Bleche-Wite-Tire-Cleaner/dp/B006T0F8MA) (careful to not get it on the paint nor aluminum or magnesium wheels) applied with curved foam pads, too, to clean the sidewall of the tires so any tire-wet/shine applied later stays on longer and more uniformly.  I use it with [foam applicators](http://www.amazon.com/Eagle-One-5010602-Tire-Swipes/dp/B00062Z2M8).  

5. Rinse away the soapy water with a hose with no attachments, [letting the water sheet off the vehicle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCeyTHyFbck).  

6. Fully dry the car using [super-absorbant shammies](http://www.amazon.com/The-Absorber-Synthetic-Drying-Chamois/dp/B0000AY69V).  

7. Turn off the air filter to prevent it from pushing air out of the garage, causing more unfiltered air from entering the garage when pulling the car in than otherwise; then open the garage, put the car in the garage and close the door behind it.  Turn the air filter back on and keep the air filter running for a while to circulate the air and remove any dust that got in while driving the car in.  

Note - *if necessary, blow the vehicle dry further using an electric leaf blower (no exhaust) inside the garage.  The air in the garage that is sucks in and blows onto the car will be clean because it was already filtered by the air purifier.*  


(*This is a good time to get something to eat.*)


8. Clay the entire vehicle using [Maguiar's clay kit](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Smooth-Surface-Clay-Kit/dp/B00063X7KG).  

9. Apply (&amp; buff/remove excess) [Maguiar's #7 Mirror Glaze](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Mirror-Professional-Glaze-liquid/dp/B0002UQAM0)

10. Apply (&amp; buff/remove excess) either [Maguiar's #26 Yellow Liquid Wax](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Hi-Tech-Yellow-Wax-ounces/dp/B0002SQZR2) OR [Maguiar's Ultimate Liquid Wax](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Ultimate-Liquid-Wax-oz/dp/B004HCM9H4).  

11. If the Ultimate Wax (which is synthetic) was used, I might wait a few hours then apply a coat of wax (Yellow 26) on top.  Otherwise, I'm done.  

12. I might also apply detailer wax spray like Ultimate Detailer by Maguiar's.  

13. Apply tire-wet to the tires.  I use [Maguiers Endurance](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-Endurance-Tire-Dressing-Trigger/dp/B004HCM9GK) along with [foam applicators](http://www.amazon.com/Eagle-One-5010602-Tire-Swipes/dp/B00062Z2M8).  

14.  Come back to the car hours later and check it for any imperfections. 


I use a cheap dual-action random orbital buffer (10"") for all of this.  

There's more I'd like to add but I have to step away right now.  I'll update when I can.  

I'd love to hear feedback.  The one thing I haven't experience in yet is polishing.  


Note - I really enjoyed some this excellent Maguiars video: 


**[Meguiar's Training video - How To Wax Your Car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPdShfeakzw)**

Smooth surface clay kit
Cleaner Wax

My real question is how often is each step done?
1. I'm assuming your wouldn't have to clay your car as often as any of the other steps?
2. Do you polish every time you wax of if its just needed when full detail?
3. I guess which steps are most important? persay get away with a wash/wax and or quick detail?

Thanks a ton for advise and will post pictures asap.

Edit:
Alright guys thanks a ton for all the info, went out and got some supplies and did a pretty quick wash, wax and ultimate quick wax. a few pics of before,during and after.

Happy New Year.",orangesrkay,19,6,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/15sgnr/how_to_get_vomit_out_of_fabric_oh_and_uh_happy/,"Last night one of my friends vomitted out of the window on the highway in my 5 month old car.  Basically, my passenger side back seat reeks and had digusting puke all over it.  I managed to get the chunks out with warm water, a washcloth, and some armorall wipes but there is still puke in (not on) the fabirc and I want to get rid of the smell completely.

I may just take it to an auto detail shop they charge $20 a seat. But I'd like to do it myself because I also have a small grease stain on the driver seat.

**For those wondering, this is what I ended up doing**

I went to a car wash place nearby, the manager on duty must have seen this as an opportunity and we both made out.  I paid him $30 cash and he had the seat cleaned and gave me their full package deal so I saved about 20.00 and he got a New year's bonus. (the place charges $20/seat for steam clean)  
Autobatch, the car has now been cleaned twice since the incident, so I'll apply some protective sealer that came from the dealership when I bought the car.

Thanks all!

Any help is greatly appreciated.  I did search but found nothing specific to vomit.  Thanks! ",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,1357146544.0,,,True,t3_15sgnr,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/15sgnr/how_to_get_vomit_out_of_fabric_oh_and_uh_happy/,

After some research including the links to the right, I've come up with this as my process and product selection:

1. Wash the car with Prima Mystique car wash (using two bucket method and a water deionizer).

2. Clay the car using Griot's clay and speed shine.

3. (optional step) Polish the car only as required (not for a while since this is a new car?).  If required, used a random orbital machine.

4. Use a sealant (Optimum OptiSeal).

5. Wax with P21 carnauba by hand.

I believe steps 1, 2, 4, and 5 will be done most washing sessions (once a month, as it will be garaged).

Part 2!,meckinville,13,2,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1jguux/can_i_save_my_roommates_paint_job_part_2/,"Almost a month ago I submitted this thread http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1i1jx5/can_i_save_my_roommates_paint_job/ 


Well today all the polishing supplies I ordered came in and I decided I was going to give it a shot.

http://imgur.com/a/FG8E6

On the first test spot shown in the album I tried using Meguiar's M105 with the Meguiar's yellow polishing pad and I followed that with Meguiar's M205 and the Meguiar's beige finishing pad. The correction was minimal and I didn't even take a picture of it. 

I taped off another test spot and this time tried using the M105 with the maroon cutting pad and the M205 with the yellow polishing pad. So much better. The 50-50 shots are of that test spot.


The pictures aren't really great... it's tough to hold the spotlight with one hand and take a picture with the other. In some spots there is still some cloudiness, its far from perfect but it's SO much better. The spots I worked first are cloudier than the spots I ended on... showing that my technique got better with just that small amount of polishing. 

It got dark as I was finishing up so I don't have any complete shots of the finished hood right now but I will update the album tomorrow when it's light and I get some pictures. I was just so excited about how great it turned out that I couldn't wait to make a post.

EDIT: It's light out! Though very cloudy. Added some wide shots of the finished product to the album. I didn't really bother with any closeups... it's still not perfect. All the scratches are gone but it's still a LITTLE bit cloudy and then there's spots where the paint has been taken off from bugs that were never removed.

I will not act like I know what I am doing when it comes to Auto Detailing. I want to get into a routine for keeping up with the new SUV in order to keep it looking good through winter and summer. 

I have limited experience washing cars throughout my life and do not know all of the steps to produce a great finish. I understand the basics of pre-soak, wash, rinse, wax... but I do not understand all of the techniques. I am overwhelmed by all of the products available on AutoGeek... things for washing, certain brushes for wheels, certain wash mitts, drying rags, waxing products, interior, etc. 

My Explorer has black leather interior so I would like to keep that in good condition as well. All of your tips are appreciated. I took a look at the following resources on this sub and elsewhere:

* [Bare Minimum Supplies](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/n77q2/beginners_guide_to_detailing_products_the_bare/)
* [Massive Auto Detailing Product List](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1d646c/the_massive_auto_detailing_product_list/)
* [AutoGeek Detailing Tips](http://www.autogeek.net/detailingtips.html)

I am trying to do my research just overwhelmed by all the information, methods, products, etc. I want to get started building a kit and the beginners guide looks like a great start... I also want to learn proper technique and process (from start to finish). I know some people use high pressure wash while others recommend garden hose can work fine.

The beginners guide here is a good intro for supplies needed but does not go into much of the technique (2-bucket method, rinsing, washing, wheels, different brushes and tools, interior... including leather).

So the side mirror trim on my E46 BMW was super faded. I can't fault the car, the thing is 10 years old and sits outside most of the time. I've used that Mother's product called ""Back to Black"" before, but that stuff lasts about one rain shower and I'm pretty sure the trim comes out looking worse every time you use it.

So I set out to restore these trim pieces. Forever Black is pretty much one-of-a-kind in this market. All other trim products are just silicone and oils to make the trim look black for a short time before wearing off. However Forever Black is a dye system that actually dyes the plastic black. 

Here is how it came out: [Result](http://i.imgur.com/sKHFH2G.jpg?1)

**Review**: The kit comes with a cleaner concentrate and the bottle of dye. The dye bottle claims that one coat can restore the trim, and for a rich luster, an optional second coat can be applied. Unfortunately, it wasn't that easy. It took eight applications (once every 20 minutes) to achieve the final result. Another negative is the applicator that comes attached to the bottle. Do not use it. At all. Use a foam paint brush. The good: although I had to apply way more than two coats, it does do what it says it does. No harsh fumes or anything either which is good. I also have a TON of the stuff left over, even after doing both trim pieces 8 times each. I'd say this product is worth the $15 and the few hours it took me to complete the process. I give this product 3/5 stars.

I have purchased all of the items for my basic wash/wax kit from Amazon. I have been able to find all of the products I wanted to create a kit for beginners. Please see my other threads ([Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1ihlg1/my_first_kit_part_1_car_wash_supplies/) and [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1k7tju/my_first_kit_part_2_expanding_basic_kit/)). 

**Back on Topic**: My recent order to expand my kit included the [Lexol Leather Cleaner, Conditioner, and Vinylex kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZBPXGS/ref=shptrk_scth). I was very excited for these products to keep my leather interior looking nice and new. The kit was only $23 and includes Lexol Leather Cleaner, Lexol Leather Conditioner, Vinylex (can be used on interior, exterior trim, wheels, etc), and a couple nice product application sponges.

When I opened the kit I noticed that there was an extremely minor leak near the cap on the Lexol Leather Cleaner. The bottle was undamaged, the cap looked fine, there was no mess or problem with the rest of the order. I do not even think any product was lost but I was concerned by the minor leak. 

I figured I would contact Amazon and let them know about the issue and see if they could send a replacement Lexol Leather Cleaner bottle. I even sent the URL for the Leather Cleaner ($7.00) that would be a suitable replacement. 

Amazon went above and beyond my expectations and sent a complete replacement Lexol Kit via overnight shipping (should arrive tomorrow). No questions asked. No hassle. No need to return the current kit or provide proof of damage. I have always been impressed by Amazon's customer service but this was even above and beyond my expectations.

---

**TL;DR** - ordered a [$23 Lexol Leather Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ZBPXGS/ref=shptrk_scth) from Amazon. The Lexol Leather Cleaner bottle had an extremely minor leak. Amazon is overnighting me a complete replacement kit (not just a replacement for the leather cleaner). I do not have to return any portion of the first kit!

I've narrowed down my da choice to either the Habor Freight or Griot's Garage, but I keep finding different people saying different things and it's complicating my decision on the two.  So, a few questions:

*I know I need to replace the backing plate if I get the HF, but what about the GG?  Is it good with the 6inch or does it really need the 5?

*In [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYed_Hnrql4&amp;t=8m0s) Drive clean video, I love how Larry simplifies this whole thing with a 1,2,3 grade setup.  I know I want Lake Country pads, but what pads would be make up a good 1,2,3 setup and what polishes would go well with those grades?

*I was under the impression that 1 pad could do a whole car, but, from what others have said, that's obviously not the case.  How many pads would I need for a smallish sedan (2003 Saab 9-3)?  How often should I change out the pad (1 panel, 2 panels, ect)?

*Lastly, in light of the previous questions and desire for a simple 1,2,3 setup, what GG da kit would ya'll suggest?!

I could just spray the front every few years, but ppf is probably cheaper and still looks reasonable. (The car is painted in a rare color for this model--special ordered Samoa Orange on a TT RS.)

If I do go the ppf route, what surface prep should be done first? My installer said not to detail it first, since he'll prep the surface (not sure what he does for that).

The headlights on my car are looking pretty gross, so I looked into getting them replaced and found out restoration is a better option. The car is your average commuter sedan, about eight years old, and is parked outside 24/7 - I'm looking to extend the car's lifetime, not pick up detailing as a hobby. (Though you guys get some awesome results!) 

If I'm understanding what I've read correctly, the usual process is wet sand -&gt; polish -&gt; protect. I'm planning to pick up sandpaper at the hardware store from 600 grit to 2500 or so. For polishing, do I need a dedicated plastic polish (such as Plast-X) or will something like Scratch-X do the job? My car has some water stains I'd like to try to clean up as well, so if I can get one product to tackle both I'd prefer it. (The water stains may well be too deep for that or too elbow-destroying to remove by hand, we'll see.) I'll be working by hand - do I need a pad of some kind, or can polishing be done with a microfiber cloth? For sealant, do headlights and other plastics need a dedicated sealant, or will the same sealant used for the rest of the car do the job?

Unfortunately, she never had a knack for cars and outside of the usual wash I had no idea auto-detailing could be so.. Intense.

Right now I have an '06 Jeep Commander that I would LOVE to start taking far better care of. Unfortunately, I've done nothing but the occasional wash - and, *gasp* I've always used dish detergent - so we're starting off in really bad shape here fellas. I'm really, really sorry. I know ignorance is no excuse, but please for any of you who are more knowledgeable than me I would LOVE some advice on certain things that I've found very hard to Google / find other examples of around the week or so I've been browsing this sub.

**My biggest concern:**

[Here is image 1 of the rear-side bumper.](http://imgur.com/BtN9PmV,4XDvCw9#0) - I believe it isn't the same painted material as the rest of my Jeep because the wear on it is absolutely atrocious compared to the panel that is directly next to it. But I have NO idea what to do with the bubbling material that is coming off the top of the paint.. Any ideas what caused this / methods to fix it?

[Second image](http://imgur.com/BtN9PmV,4XDvCw9#1) - As you can see, the paint directly above and below it is perfectly fine. And if I had zoomed out more the paint in the same exact spot but inches to the side is also perfectly fine. It is only on those specific parts of the Jeep on both sides, but idk what it is or how to fix it. I can take more images if the problem isn't clear here.


Also, obviously a [Jeep Commander](http://www.jeepcolors.info/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/2009-Jeep-Commander-Limited-4X2-2.jpg) is by no means a ""small"" job to do a full work on.. Is it even fathomable to do some of the things like polishing it by hand or should I just go ahead and invest in a ""DA"" - which, I'm still not 100% certain what that even stands for, I just know its a tool that I possibly may REQUIRE as opposed to just being a convenient time saver?

Ok ok, gonna hopefully end this there.. Thank you so much to anyone who can manage to help me out with the bubble paint thing, I honestly have no clue what to do / if anything can be done about that at home.

To me, it seems like if you use very little water, nothing would really need to be covered, I mean, it is open on the bottom and you drive through puddles and in rainstorms, right?

I was wondering if someone could tell me more about carnauba wax, less so where it comes from because I can just find that on Wikipedia but more so from a manufacturing viewpoint.

I understand that the carnauba wax on the market is not 100% carnauba wax, of course it needs to be mixed in with other compounds to turn it into a paste that is car friendly, otherwise we may as well be scratching our cars with keys.

But when it comes to manufacturing carnauba wax, to my knowledge there are different types of carnauba wax, Type 1, Type 3 and Type 4 (Type 4 typically being found in polishes) but what's the difference? Why are certain types of carnauba wax used in different products? Can Type 1 carnauba wax be used in a car polish? What kind of mixture (or percentage) would make the optimal car polish?

I started from ground zero (the only supplies I owned were a hose and fireman nozzle) and wanted to purchase all of the necessary supplies for a complete **basic wash kit** (2-bucket wash method, grit guards, etc). More details can be found in [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1ihlg1/my_first_kit_part_1_car_wash_supplies/).

The purpose of these threads is to document my progress and to also provide information and assistance to other beginners that may be in the same boat I was. There is a ton of information available and sometimes it can be very overwhelming.

I [created a thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1jkyib/expanding_kit_questions_for_a_beginner_clay/) a couple weeks ago asking about a few products I was considering for my kit. I had my basic wash supplies from Part 1 but I wanted additional supplies to finalize the basic process:

* **Clay Bar Kit**
* **Wax**
* **Leather Care**

These basic items will help me expand my basic kit. I will now be able to remove surface contaminants with the clay bar kit and finalize the wash with a nice wax. The leather cleaner and conditioner will also add a nice touch to the interior and keep my leather looking new.

* 1) Rinse off with water

* 4) Dry using shammies and also autozone brand blue drying towel (which leaves lint and particles as well, even after a wash)

Am I doing something wrong? I can't help but feel like my car is being scratched when I dry it off. The towels are soft but maybe small towel fibers that come off are causing this?


**UPDATE**

I am using the 2 bucket method and it sounds like I need a quality waffle weave drying towel in addition to the sheet rinse to minimize drying needed from a towel. Great advice I appreciate everyones help.

The paint on my car needs correction as well, but I decided on the gf's car first.

1. Wash with dawn liquid soap
2. Claybar

4. Masked off sections with painters tape.
5. Sonax SIP with Lake Country CCS Yellow pad
6. Sonax sealant with Lake Country CCS Black pad.

I was going to use Sonax finishing polish as well, but didn't notice much of a difference after using the SIP.  Worked great as a 1 step polish.

I've recently received a new 2013 Honda Civic EX in metal metallic as a graduation present. After stumbling upon this subreddit, I've become hooked to the idea of keeping my car as clean and new looking as possible because of all the posts here of beautifully detailed cars. I've been reading the guides on Detailed Image and the stuff in the sidebar, but all this information has been overwhelming and I have a few questions if someone could help a newbie out. I've purchased some stuff from the bare minimum list to get me started (gold class shampoo, wash mitt, mf cloths)

I'm a bit confused about the layers of a car's surface. For a brand new car, is it just the paint layer and the clear coat on top of it? If I were to do a clay bar, does this remove the clear coat? I'm afraid that if I just jump in with all the different kinds of stuff like glazes, polishes, sealants, and wax that I'll have a messed up ordering of layers on my car's paint surface which I definitely don't want.

Also, for stuff like polish and sealant, do I do a clay bar beforehand every time to remove the remaining protection on the paint surface?

Sorry if I sound like a I need my hand held through all this. I just want to make sure that I do everything right to begin with since my car is only a month old. If someone could get me started on the right foot, I promise to post progress pictures of my car after I detail it and such.

I get asked at work all the time how to clean them so I figured I'd make a post about it. There's a whole bunch of special products you can buy to do it, fancy brushes and even 'paint/chalk sticks' to revitalize your white lettering, but the way that I do it at home is so simple.

My secret? S.O.S pads (Which is basically just steel wool presoaked in soap) 

I figured I'd grab some quick pictures while I did it last night, just to show.. but it literally takes under 2 minutes per wheel.

Step 1: remove anything off the rim if you are worried about damaging it (I pulled off my center caps and trim ring prior to the pictures because I was mounting the tires first) 
http://i.imgur.com/6WAdEFI.jpg

Step 2: Spray the tire down with water (Cold water is fine in most cases, if they were really old/yellowed then hot water will clean them a bit better. I just used cold) 
http://i.imgur.com/JpMweXV.jpg

Step 3: Wet the S.O.S Pad, then use it to go all around the tire, specifically the white lettering. It will generally take a few passes to get all of the dirt off. If there is a pretty stubborn spot, it's totally fine to scrub with a bit of pressure, unless it's 'raised, outlined' white lettering, in which case it is easier to tear, so just be careful and do more, light passes instead. 
http://i.imgur.com/GdM4reW.jpg

EDIT: To clarify, the tires I did were fine because they are full white letter, what I mean by raised outline lettering is when only the edges of the letters are raised, in white and the inside is black. As they get older they do tend to become easy to tear if you scrub too hard.

Step 4: Rinse the tire off. You'll probably notice if they were really bad a few small spots that need gone over. 

http://i.imgur.com/bi3BuAP.jpg

And viola, your white lettered tires look  brand new. All for under a dollar.

I would also have to recommend against any sort of 'rub on' tire shine/dressing, etc as they generally tend to bleed the black into the white lettering and yellow it pretty quickly. 

I use one S.O.S pad per tire, but you can probably get away with less if they aren't that dirty.. but they do tend to fall apart by the end of a tire, and really I bought a box of 10 for 1.25$ Vs the 'whitewall revitalization paint pen"" I saw for 12$",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,1365008044.0,,,True,t3_1blfsj,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1blfsj/how_to_clean_whitewallwhite_letter_tires/,

However, fundamentally the a polish removes your clear coat in order for it to even out the gashes (swirls). For whatever reason, this rubs me the wrong way. You only have a certain amount of clear coat! If you are as religious as I am about having a clean and waxed car, that is alot of polishing, even at 4 times a year or so.

Often times I think about only giving my finish a really intensive polish when I am actually about to sell the car, so it looks flawless. Even though I will see swirls in my black paint all the time, at least i'm holding on to as much clear coat as possible?

I've been wanting to really detail my truck right for over a year now, but things just haven't worked out. Anyway, finally got everything together and got to work. Took about 15 hours total to do everything, but it was worth it. First I washed and dried the truck well. Then I clayed the entire truck. After that I got into the good stuff. I used a Porter Cable 7424XP and various Lake Country pads. I started off by compounding the entire truck with Meguiars Ultimate Compound which removed most major scratches, swirls and streaks. Of course, some scratches and other imperfections can simply not be buffed out because they are so deep. That took about four hours. Second, I went over the entire truck again with a Meguiars Polish. This removed the remaining smaller and finer scratches and swirls that the compounding either missed or left behind. Another four hours there. This basically got the paint looking near new. Finally I finished the paint off with Mequiars NXT 2.0 wax with the porter cable. This of course protects the paint, but doesn't really do much to improve the shine. After all the hard work, the truck looks incredible. Other than a few scratches and nicks that can't be removed, the paint looks like it is brand new and has a mirror finish too it. Take a look through the following album and see the progression of the paint. If anyone would like more specifics i'd be glad to give them. Let me know how you think I did and feel free to throw out some more pointers as this was my first time.

I spent all that time, money, and effort to not only drive a total of 8 hours to get it detailed, but also to swirl my paint worse than a machine wash. Now I'm left with a car that was worse then before it was detailed and my place smells like I slaughtered a cow 5 weeks ago.

It's a 2011 Audi in gloss red. I used [this 2 bucket method](http://www.detailedimage.com/Auto-Detailing-Guide/Washing-and-Drying/#two-bucket) with 2 grit guards each; [this Death-scented hog brush](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B12T9C/ref=oh_o06_s00_i00_details), and [this foam gun shampoo](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GXZ5JM/ref=oh_o06_s00_i01_details). I also used a microfiber mitt thing from Walmart for my wheels.

I definitely didn't swirl it during drying, as I basically blotted the water off. It was that goddamn brush. I can see the scratch marks going in the pattern that I was brushing.

The only thing I can think of is I didn't use enough shampoo or the brush freaked out (basically, the hairs attached to each other so it is now many bunches of hair and not just 'fluff'). The only thing I know for certain is that I'm getting a foam gun. 

I'd really, *really* appreciate some a) tips to not repeat my mistakes and b) recommendations for new washing equipment so I don't have to touch the car to clean it.

Thanks!

I have a jeep wrangler with 6"" of lift and 35"" mud tires and I'm trying to get it looking pretty. I often go awhile between off roading so during those times I want it clean. 

First what would you all recommend for cleaning bedliner? The floor is bedlined and it is really dirty. Pressure washing just makes it look faded and old even though its clean. Obviously it isn't going to be perfect since its the floor but something to restore the original black color would be awesome.

Second the mud terrain tires are very knobby and I'm having trouble finding a brush to get into the bumps on the sidewall. Any recommendations on a deeper brush? My local auto parts stores don't carry anything that fits well. 

And lastly is there any waxes or finish products that will help reduce scratching from light branches? I'm painting her soon and anything that will help would be good. I'm thinking about buying a powered buffer to get the little scratches out if it'll help.

Thanks! I only recently subbed and so far this is an awesome subreddit. The pictures are amazing. I read one of the stickies and I'm going to buy some products soon to detail my 2010 Journey.

Ive previously maintained my z06 with M205, M105, Wolfgangs TSR 3.0, Wolfgangs Finishing Glaze, Wolfgangs Deep Gloss Paint Sealant 3.0 and Wolfgangs Deep Gloss Spritz Sealant (weekly).  I decided to give the Fuzion a try (the car is a garage queen...I would not reccomend Fuzion due to longevity issues on a daily driver).  

The wax applies and wipes off easily.  I only used a small amount to do the car, I anticipate that even monthly waxes Ill be able to keep this tub for 2 years.  The wax deepend the color of the paint ever so slightly (not enough to capture on picture).  It was not the dramatic results I was hoping for, but its not terrible.  The wax is targeted for dark paints and reds, so I suspect that my high flake electron blue is a hard color to get to really pop.  I dont think I will buy the fuzion again for this car as the price vs results wasnt justified to me.  I will give it a shot on a darker car and post the results.  Im not bashing the product, it does give a great gloss and depth to the paint, but it is a bit steep on the price side and the longevity of the product is questionable (but shouldnt be a worry for a garage queen, but I do like waxes I can use on multiple cars).  I plan on maintaining the fuzion with the sprtiz sealant and rewaxing every 6 weeks or so.  Anyways, thanks for reading and onto the pictures!

Return?,FLredditguy,9,0,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1bhr4z/urgent_issue_with_new_car_swirl_city_return/,"My wife and I purchased a new car for her this past weekend after we decided her 11yr old econobox had fulfilled it's purpose.

We purchased a nicely equipped SUV with a paint color that cost extra money. We got a great deal on the car under invoice, and were generally happy with the deal until today when it was finally sunny outside.

I discovered that the car is absolutely covered in swirl marks. Like whoever detailed it coated the rotary buffer with sand.

When we looked at the car in the afternoon, it was so dirty/dusty from being next to road construction and windy conditions that my careful combing of the entire car didn't detect the swirls. It was also cloudy that day. By the time we got out of the dealer and they ""cleaned"" it up, it was dark, and my final inspection of the vehicle yielded no problems.

I spoke with the dealer today and will drive the car back there tomorrow. It hasn't left the driveway since we got home after purchasing it, so we havent driven the miles up. The dealer genuinely sounded sorry about it, and asked to see it tomorrow. They also brought up the idea of canceling the sale if we aren't happy.

Anyone ever been able to return a car for damage like this? Some of the scratches are so bad that you can feel them with a fingernail, and the whole car has them except for the side mirrors, where they didn't use the buffer of course.

Prior to videoing the windshield, I cleaned both sides with the same glass cleaner and microfiber towel. 

I've not cleaned the windshield since the last time I made a video(2'ish months). As far as ease of cleaning, I would have to say that both products make a huge impact in how much easier the windshield is to clean than before coating it.

Both products are acting as they did a week after applying. The Opti-Glass PRO beads and the Flyby30 sheets. Both work well at repelling water, differently. 

One area I have seen a difference, is how they perform while dirty. As I noted, the windshield has not been cleaned in quite some time. The OGP does not appear to be impacted as much as the flyby30 when REALLY dirty. To outline exactly what I am saying, let me make it clear that I've not been using my wipers much at all. Since applying the coatings those wipers have probably swiped all of 20 times. I am trying to get a feel for how the products perform while clean and while dirty. Wipers provide that relatively dirt-free surface. No the glass has not been formally cleaned, but the wipers allow both products to act like new after the wipers stroke a few times. That is what I am speaking about while in context of dirty/clean performance in this paragraph.

I've been happy with both. Again, they are different animals. FB3 can be applied in a couple minutes with no fear of a screw up and cost a few bucks to apply. OCP is expensive, you fear a mistake more-so than OCP but performs very well.

Feel free to leave your own feedback on either product.

I'm a noob and don't really have any detailing experience.  I only use soap/water and at most 303 on my interior. My exterior I usually just take to a touchless car wash and wipe the water off after running through it.  

I've been tempted to just clean up the car and put this on, but it's 51% carnuba wax and I live in Arizona.  A coworker mentioned it would just melt and slide right off after a week or so.  Can I layer this on top of some waxes?  I know this product is going to give a crazy shine, but I'm guessing I should probably wax the car before applying it.

However, I'm not exactly confident they did a thorough job (there was still like a sappy kind of residue in lines among other incredibly minor issues). I am also seeing magical swirls and scratches appear despite only having taken it to the coin op once or twice. I would like to keep this car clean, but due to certain circumstances I need it to be as easy as possible. 

There's a local detailer who will do coatings, and I am tempted to get it applied because of the supposed ease of maintenance. I'm specifically looking at Opticoat or CQuartz.

My questions - 

Did I make the Opticoat/CQuartz redundant by getting pp?

Is it more work or harder to apply (i.e. will the guy need to remove the dealership work before he starts)? 

I feel like CQuartz is almost too good for the car - I'm not driving a BMW or Porsche; would it be a waste to have that treatment over the Opticoat?

Am I better off saving my money and just riding it out until the dealership sealant is worn through?

I'm new to these boards and to new cars (I drove a used Civic for 11 years; this is my first new car) so I'm hoping this subreddit can help me make sense of it all. I want this car to last and I am willing to invest to maintain it.

Long story short, we're a large Toyota dealership, and I run the detail department. I'm the guy to go to when a shitty scratch or a terribly swirled black car needs to be sanded, compounded, and polished.

To this effect, I've worked plenty of miracles thus far - but today I got a doozy. The car is a 2010 dark metallic grey Corolla, that was wrecked and had a lot of body work and paint. Horrible paint. Thus is my problem.

A door doesn't match. The rear bumper cover is MUCH darker than the rest of the car. The quarter panels, C pillars, roof, and deck lid have HORRIBLE fisheyes and ripples/orangepeel in the clear. Basecoat was probably shot okay, but WAY TOO MUCH CLEAR ALL OVER.

Obligatory clearcoat overspray all over the car.

_________________________________________________

Here are my resources. Air DA with 1500 and 3000 grit. DeWalt 600-3200 RPM buffer with any pad I might need. Multiple compounds and polishes, all body shop safe.

Realistically, the car needs to be sanded back through that shit clear, MAYBE hit with another base, and the clear resprayed. I obviously can't do that.

I had the occasion to take it to the dealer service center, and they washed it there, for free. This was a hand-wash with big pad scrubbies.  I noticed the car was much cleaner, and was happy.... but.

On the door handles, I noticed that it looks like the paint is crazed and/or chipping away, but it's still white under what's coming off -- and what's coming off seems to be like a clear coat.

The problem is that I live in a downtown building with zero access to a hose or anywhere to wash the thing. I usually get it detailed/polished by a good local shop in the spring.

In the summer I use one of the two touchless carwashes in my entire metro area, they both kind of suck for various reasons.

The problem is in the winter that I ski a ton (car has a clear bra for the gravel,) this means my car gets absolutely filthy, way beyond the ability of a touchless car wash to get acceptably clean. We're talking a 1/16th"" layer of dirt, sand, grit, from the front wheels back. What you end up with is a nice pattern on the car that shows you where the water jets were centered.

With my schedule, getting out to someones place and hand washing is just not feasible. So, I'm starting to think my new strategy is to touchless wash as much as I can but go in for the occasional machine wash when it starts getting really nasty, with touchless washes in between - and leave it up to the yearly polish/detail to knock down whatever swirls I do pick up.

There's a nice brand new machine wash down here that I've used once and it left less swirling than the dealership when they did me the ""favor"" of hand washing my car after a service.

I wanted to share the method I find gives me great results and some pictures.

I use 1z Plastic Deep Cleaner.

I use a horse hair brush like this one: http://www.autogeek.net/natural-horse-hair-interior-upholstery-brush.html

The process itself is pretty straight forward. Remove any surface dust with a mf that has had cockpit premium misted on(just enough to generate some grab in the fibers). Use a long bristle brush to clean out any dust cracks or crevices. If you don't remove the surface dust, you may make a mix that is extra nasty. Working 1 section of a panel at a time, use the horse hair brush with enough 1z PDC to generate a foam while cleaning. Depending on how dirty the panel is, you may clean a lot of surface, or make 1 ""pass"" before needing to wash the brush out. Wipe up any residue after a ""pass"" with a mf towel. Use a compressor blow tip in conjunction with a mf towel to remove any build up in the cracks and crevices(which will be necessary if you're generating a foam). Be mindful not to just blast air in without the mf towel in the best spot. Otherwise you will have a mess.

Sometimes, if there is a thick build up in a crack, you may need to use a different longer bristle brush to agitate the build up before it releases.

When I say pass, I am using that term very loosely. A pass is not a single pass over the surface as much as it is a single mini-session working the brush and product before wiping up.

Between the soft bristles of the horse hair brush and the 1z PDC, I've been able to clean just about anything off of a vinyl surface. Because it is gentle, I use this same method of a dashboard and get great results every time. If you're using it on a larger surface like a dashboard, you should really work in small areas though. I find you get consistant results working smaller areas.

I like to top the cleaning up with a solid wipe down of 1z Cockpit Premium

This is not the absolute fastest way to get ""good enough"" results that some people are looking for. In other words, if you do this professionally and are not charging to spend a notable sum of time on the vinyl, this may not be the best option for you. But if you do charge accordingly(or you're the owner wanting the best results and time is not an issue), I believe this is one of the best methods to get really really good results. It is time consuming but oh so worth it.

We are going into your first winter since you have developed OCD...err...I mean detailing skills. This means you need to ensure you are properly washing your vehicle.

First off, ensure your car is waxed beautifully and with quality wax that will last throughout the winter. You can get examples reading posts in this subreddit or you can check out the link in the sidebar titled ""Extensive Wax Testing"".


There are three common ways you can approach this:


* Touch-less Car Washes
* Manual Car Wash
* Home Washing


Which ever way you choose, please remember that touch-less car washes should be at the bottom of the list. Some locations have very strong soap with certain ingredients that are known to strip wax or deteriorate it 

My biggest tip and main reason for posting is: PLEASE make sure you dry your door hinges and the interior of the door frame -- use canned air and anything you can to ensure they are free of water. Do yourself a favor and go back 2 hours and then 4-5 hours (if you can) and just open your door and close it a few times. 

I bring this tip to you because as some of you may know, water FREEZES. This has happened to me. Trust me, you do not want to be outside in a blizzard the next morning with an extension cord and a hair dryer. **It sucks.**

If you happen to get frozen. You can break the door free a certain way, but you must be careful. Line up your body against the door frame where the edge of door meets the bodyframe.

This seems like it will be a real game-changer for both novices and pro detailing shops. In a nutshell you get CRAZY cut, especially on softer paints, with the ease of use of a true finishing polish. Even on my Z06 which has very hard clear, I was able to get about 60% correction from this stuff.

Photo: http://i.imgur.com/ljKNIh.jpg

A few more pics: http://imgur.com/a/Bg79N

In a nutshell use is as-follows: Hard clears - white pad on a DA. Softer paints you can use a black pad -- yes a black pad and you are still going to get a serious amount of correction. 2 drops without pad priming is all you need and about a 2' x 2' area can be done in a minute.

This polish is not available ""retail"" yet, however if you are interested in getting some message me and I can send you the info. I do not sell it or have any  association with the one distributor in the US. (Trying to not make this post sound spammy!)

So i was hoping I could get some guidance here on where I could save some money and if these products will be enough.

Also, since I go to college out of state, and the next time I would have time to do full details on them is in January (Florida), the vehicles need to remain protected with bi-weekly washes. The truck is barely driven so it won't be washed as often. 

*Here are the three vehicles:* 

* 2009 BMW 335i Coupe - Black Sapphire: Medium paint correction needed
* 2011 Ford Mustang 5.0 Convertible - Black: Medium paint correction needed
* 2004 GMC Sierra 2500HD King Cab w/ 8 ft bed - Black: Extreme paint correction needed

*Here's my current list that I plan on picking up from DI with prices:*

* Dodo Juice Sour Power Gloss Enhancing Shampoo - 250ml: $13.99
* Chemical guys Signature Series Orange Degreaser - 16oz: $8.99
* DI Accessories Fine Grade Clay Bar - 100g: $10.99
* DI Accessories Medium Grade Clay Bar - 200g: $18.99
* Dodo Juice Born Slippy Clay Lube Concentrate - 250ml: $12.99
* Porter Cable 7424XP Random Orbital Buffer: $124.99

* Lake County Orange Light Cutting Pad - 6.5in: $9.99
* Menzerna Micro Polish SF 4500 - 32oz: $34.99

* Black Wow - 4oz: $29.99
* Leatherique Pristine Clean - 16oz: $19.99
* Leatherique Rejuvenator Oil - 16oz: $29.99
* DI Brushes Pet Hair Removal Brush: $8.99
* DI Accessories 22oz Trigger Spray Bottle - 2pcs: $9.99

**Total Cost: $509.30**

*What I already have:*

* 303 Aerospace Protectant
* Sheepskin Wash Mitt
* Buckets
* Grit Gaurd
* DI Accessories Microfiber Starter Kit
* Poor Boy's Wheel Sealant
* Tire Dressing

*Here are the questions I have:* 

* Do I have the right pads that I'll need for the polishes and sealant?
* Do I have enough polish for all three vehicles?
* Do I have enough sealant for one coat on all three vehicles? For at least two coats on the BMW and Mustang and one on the GMC? Two coats on all vehicles? 
* Am I using the right clay bars and do I have enough?

I know this is a long list, but I want to make sure that I have everything that I need to make my parent's cars look beautiful again and that they can stay that way until I can do another full detail. 

Thanks in advance everyone.

* Should I wax plastic (unpainted, rough texture, black) exterior trim? If not, what product to protect this? There's big areas of this on the rear of my car.
* Should I clay bar and/or wax headlights? I'm pretty sure I've read that this is a *yes*, and I did this time, but just checking.
* How do I know when a clay bar needs replacing? I'm pretty sure the one I used is about done for since I picked up *a lot* of junk, I wouldn't be surprised if my car had never been detailed before I owned it. 

Products used: Meguiars Gold wash, chenille MF mitt (2 bucket system), Meguiars clay bar kit using the included quick detail spray, and Meguiars black wax paste with included pad. I need to get that supreme guzzler drying towel from the bare minimum list, the MF drying towel I got at Target was just ok.

I just got a used truck, a really nice 2009 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  It's a beautiful color called Speedway Blue.  

It looks like this: http://images.gtcarlot.com/pictures/27178371.jpg

The problem is, being a used truck, it had a few scratches and such on it and either a former owner or dealer tried to repair those scratches with a paint pen or a brush.  Adding to the issue is the fact that the color is WAY off.  It's MUCH darker than my paint and makes all the issues more noticeable.  On top of all that, most of the ""repairs"" stick up above the surrounding paint.  They put the paint on too thick.

So, long story short, I want to fix it but I don't know how.  I washed and waxed my car yesterday and got a good idea of how many there were.  There are some on every panel and it will be quite a job.  

I figure I have 2 options:

1. Sand down the repairs (maybe wet sand) until everything is smooth and put down the right color (using a spray can of factory color paint) along with some clear coat on top.
2. Try and use some sort of cutting compound or scratch remover on the repairs.  This should take them down to even with the rest of the paint without doing as much damage to the surrounding area.  Then fill with paint and clear.  

Which option would be best or is there another option I haven't thought of?  I can't afford a re-spray and doing this myself should only be about $100.  

Thanks for the help!

Wash - Meguiars Classic Gold 

Clay  - Mothers claybar 

Polish - Meguiars clear coat safe polishing compound - Its meant to be hand applied, which I did and it took forever. 

Wax - Meguiars Deep crystal carnauba wax

also Meguiars Back to Black, and Gold Class high gloss quick detailer 

Wheels cleaned with Mothers Aluminum cleaner and then Mothers California gold Metal polish 

Interior cleaned with Meguiars gold class leather care, and supreme shine high gloss protectant 

I hand polished/waxed it which after claying and washing the car took me a long time, id say 9 hours, and its not like the Corrado is a big car. I bought a porter cable DA after this and am going that route next time. I did like the Meguiars polish and wax combo I used, it gives the car a very warm red. 

The only nice thing about the previous owner removing the rear interior is that it makes cleaning the interior really easy. Unfortunately tracking down the parts I need to finish off the back is a bit of a challenge but i'll get there.

Im not really a huge fan of Meguiars Back to Black, I have some Black WOW I want to try but I am trying to get rid of whats left of the Meguiars before I do. Thats really the only complaint from the stuff I used for this I have.

The cost to repaint both panels, glass and vinyl side stripe was estimated at $1200.  The lawn mower operator would be paying for this, not me.  My question though is whether it is worth it?

I just found this sub and have glanced at the FAQ but still have a few questions. One is about polishing, and the other is about my product selection. 

Firstly I will ask about polishing because that is the simple question. Polishing is only for removing swirls and scratches correct? So if I have a brand new car that (luckily) hasn't been swirled I can skip this part of the process right? 

Secondly I would like to have someone confirm my product selection and process. Before I found this sub I found a rather detailed series of write-ups and product suggestions from [Detailed Image](https://www.detailedimage.com/) I read several of their detailing guides and took them up on some of their product suggestions because they seemed to know what they were talking about. 

Thus far I have picked up the following items.

2x 5 Gallon Buckets

2x Grit guards

[Optimum Protectant Plus (Leather and dash/trim cleaner/protector. Really an armor all replacement I hope)](http://www.detailedimage.com/Optimum-OPT-M36/Protectant-Plus-P281/17-oz-S1/)

[Optimum Instal Detailer (For claying and touch up work)](http://www.detailedimage.com/Optimum-OPT-M36/Instant-Detailer-Gloss-Enhancer-P286/17-oz-S1/)

For now my process is going to be


-Rinse the car of heavy dirt/debris

-Wash the wheels &amp; tires

-Wash the car itself

-Dry the car

-Clay (Should you clay each wash, or only so often?)

-Wax (Though I don't plan to wax just yet, that is last correct?)

I've had this car just over a year now.  Shortly after purchase, I noticed the lines in the paint shown in the attached album.  Sorry the for unwashed state.. hospital parking lot, had been a bad month.  It was also the best lighting I had been in that easily showed off the issue.  I highlighted them in image four to show specifically what I'm talking about.  I realize the A pillar probably caught the most attention.

Unfortunately, I didn't realize this when I picked up the car.  During the day it's hardly noticeable, but under artificial light, it can be cringe worthy.  I'm mostly curious as to the cause and if anyone has any thoughts to mitigate.  I've been hand waxing the whole car and tried some light polishing on one of the affected panels and didn't nice a difference.

To me, it seems like the defects line up in the packing the car was shipped with.  The fifth picture is a still factory wrapped Z, but not this one. I don't have a picture of the fender, but from the factory wrap I can say that the defect I see lines up almost perfectly. I've been back and forth with the dealer on this, but they claim the car has decals on it previously.  I have since been able to contact the original owner whom says that he did no such thing.  Dunno, just want to get it fixed.

Not opposed to taking it somewhere to have it professionally worked on, just wanted to see if anyone here had any ideas or maybe even other subreddits that can assist.

Recently, I got my license and a car.

The car isn't anything special compared to what I've seen on this and other subreddits (2004 Pontiac Sunfire) but, I'd like to just give it a nice detail job when I get the chance (this summer after classes end).

The car has never been treated specially before. The only car washes it has been given are those that come free with a $25 oil change.

My question is what are some key things that would be good to do?

My goal is not to spend a whole lot of money (ideally no more than $25). However, I wouldn't mind spending more if it meant I would have some tools and stuff that would last for a while.

I was seriously going to buy a thing of shampoo at AutoZone for like $20 and have a go at it.

However, I would rather just do a nice job and do something that would last a while longer?

What would the 'to do list' be for a first auto detail?

1362005989.0,5,self.AutoDetailing,19cw8d,My dash is faded and light grey instead of dark grey. This is after using numerous vinyl protectants and cleaners,megadeth710,7,2,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/19cw8d/my_dash_is_faded_and_light_grey_instead_of_dark/,"So I'm no car expert, but I like to keep my car neat and clean on the inside. I have a 2009 Kia Spectra and about 6 months ago I cleaned my dash with Armor All. 

I have recently heard many car enthusiasts say not to use Armor All because it dries out the dash over time, etc. But of course I didnt know this until it was too late. So at first it looked ok, but after a few months the dash began to turn a light grey color (lighter than before the Armor All), and since I have been putting on many different products to try to at least get it back to its original color. I have tried Meguiar's, and 303 and Black Magic, and nothing seems to work long term, meaning it looks ok for a while but then returns to the light grey color.

In addition, after using the Armor All, these little white splotches appeared on my dash, and I ended up having to scrub them off with a brush. As a result, my dash is now like 3 different shades of grey from doing this, and putting on applications of various products. From scrubbing the dash, some parts of the dash are shinier than others, and its really noticable while looking at it from an angle.

My question is, is there anything I can do about this? I have tried a number of products, but I think the real problem is from when I used the brush to get out the white splotches, I may have grinded dirt/etc into the dash.

I realize this may be a result of stupidity/ignorance on my part. Its really not THAT noticable, but it frustrates me that I tried to keep my car looking nice, and I ended up making it worse than if I did nothing!

Personally, I started to detail from out of nowhere, one day I got bored, researched how to detail my car, bought 200$ worth of supplies and went at it. The most fun experiences I've had thus far, and despite being 19, I would like to try and make this into an actual career path.

Unfortunatley, that means I would need to start a business of my own, as simply getting minimum and little above jobs does not work out. It will also mean, that I will be the first in my entire family to start up a business doing something that I love.

I understand the clear difference between a mobile, and a stationary business and how they work, with different techniques that I've found online regarding ways to keep customers coming back, teaching them why they might need a detail, and how they can preserve their cars through good detailing. I've also learned the bare essentials needed, which include business cards, effective but different methods of offering packages or specials, and some of the tools needed. 

If anybody can provide some input as to where to get the motivation needed to keep myself always looking ahead instead of always thinking of going back to my regular routine, I would highly appreciate it, many people that know me personally have commented on my work that I should start looking towards this path, it might be my ""calling"".

It might be due to my age, and it might be from inexperience of owning a business, or generally living in this economy, I'm scared of making a mistake that might cost my future, I am an extremely carefull, and mature young adult that is looking for his exact calling. I know I've been rambling too, however it might just show how serious and how happy this hobby of myne made me thus far.

Does anybody know where this Meguiar's 105 would fall on the Griot's scale? If I use it with the orange pad will that be too rough for a first time user such as myself?

Griot's has their own system and they suggest you start with their #3 polish, which is their standard on a 1 to 5 scale of abrasiveness. Just wondering what the Meguiar's 105 would be comparable to on their scale. 

This isn't my first rodeo, but I definitely don't want to botch this and hurt my paint. I've used their product before, but never this commercial stuff, nor with a really powerful random orbital like this.

I drive a black 2008 BMW 328i. Paint is in great condition albeit a few hard water spots from apartment complex sprinklers on windy days. 

Thanks guys!

Oh, and I am going to definitely clay bar my car before all of this. 

UPDATE: Since I'm sure you've spent the rest of your day thinking how my detail turned out...

So, started out with the clay bar, as usual. It definitely didn't remove the hard water spots on my hood or roof, but they are at least smooth. I started on my trunk with the 105 Ultra Cut Compound as my test area. I was pretty freaked out because it didn't go on very smoothly. My experience with waxes and polishes is that they are nice and liquidy, ya know? So, when it didn't have a good flow to it I decided just to do the trunk and that's it. It didn't damage my paint at all, but due to uncertainty and time constraints I decided to jump to the 205 and a softer polishing pad.

I then did my roof after switching product and pad. Went on much smoother. Took it off right after it went on. The hard water spots were still visible (but we know it's only us that can see them. the rest of the world doesn't have a clue that they're there, right?).

Again, due to time constraints and not really being in a gung-ho attitude I decided to at least go around with the Mother's carnauba to get a nice shine. I really did love the way the Griot's polisher worked. That wax went on easy and even. Came off SUPER easy as well with a microfiber towel.

I'm excited about my products. Will allocate myself more time to experiment with the 105 next go around.

I still need a number of items (foam gun, clay, sealant, wax, etc).

---

Couple quick questions. Hopefully these same questions may help some other beginners.

1. **Clay Bar** - I am ready to get a [clay bar kit](http://www.amazon.com/Griots-Garage-11153-Paint-Cleaning/dp/B003POLA84/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I3V70VR6NKMG88) (planning to use [Optimum No Rinse](http://www.amazon.com/32oz-Optimum-Rinse-Wash-Shine/dp/B000E9TS6O/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1G3MIT4I820YI) cut down into detail spray/clay lube). If I clay my vehicle will it remove current wax/sealant? Does that Griot's Garage clay look like a nice kit? I know there is a patent in the US so all of the clay is the same stuff, but I like the container the Griot's Garage Clay comes in.

1. **Sealant** - I am looking at [Chemical Guys Black Light](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-GAP_619_16-Hybrid-Radiant/dp/B004L5WLZ2/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=IOOTFB3QZMUAD) and [Collinite 845](http://www.amazon.com/Collinite-Liquid-Insulator-Wax-Combo/dp/B005ZUMLV6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=IO8Y6UEU5ILN1) as a sealant. Is it possible to apply a sealant by hand (using [MF applicator pads](http://www.amazon.com/Meguiars-EvenCoat-Applicator-Pack-2/dp/B0009IQZQG/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I2QZMON5WIOEFC) and [CG ultra plush](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-MIC_1024_3-Ultra-Plush-Microfiber/dp/B00A8MZ910/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1ETOJCGQ4TUGV))? Would it be a bad idea to use sealant if I have not polished the vehicle, would this cause problems down the road?

1. **Wax** - what wax should I use after the sealants mentioned above? I was considering a Black Light / Collinite 845 combo. I have heard that the #845 is a sealant/wax mix. Would I be able to get away with simply using the Collinite?

1. **Leather Care** - [Lexol](http://www.amazon.com/Lexol-Leather-Cleaner-Conditioner-Vinylex/dp/B002ZBPXGS/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1BZNH2TVQ83NO) or [Griot's Garage](http://www.amazon.com/Griots-Garage-11142-Leather-Care/dp/B002LNGKU8/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I2WRP1GYZOHQ74) or Other??

Sorry for the questions. I have been overwhelmed with info and am still mastering my wash technique. Once I expand to include clay, sealant, and wax I will think about adding more items like [foam gun](http://www.amazon.com/Gilmour-75QGFMR-Foamaster-Adjustable-Cleaning/dp/B000XTH1GY/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I3QVTKBCZTKYSA), [trim dressing](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-TVD_109_16-Weather-Tek-Protectant/dp/B001TI1F5Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I1Y87Y47GFLWR8), [wheel well spray](http://www.amazon.com/Chemical-Guys-TVD_104_16-UnderCarriage-Detailer/dp/B001TJWO4Q/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pd_S_nC?ie=UTF8&amp;colid=25C0AUWAWS2QZ&amp;coliid=I3VI69517GV0ZK), etc.

As you can see from the pictures, the car has a lot of scratches and some other damages. There is also little to no reflection when I stand in front of the car. I'm hoping to be able to get the car to shine and look good. 

I'm also on a tight budget. I don't have a lot to spend on products because I'm still a student, but I'm hoping to make the car look way better than it is right now. 

So what products should I get, and what steps should I take?

I've done some research and read The Bare Minimum Supplies List but with all the different products out there, I'm still clueless as to what to use.
From what I've gathered I need to stop using dishwashing liquid, a polish to remove the minor swirl marks, an acrylic sealant, and finish with a wax, right? While I'm willing to put more work into my car, I don't know that I have the time for a show car detailing process so I appreciate using only the most necessary products to get that gorgeous paint shine. Obviously I need advice haha

* My car is about 16 months old.
* The paint is flat chili red.
* I have very fine swirl marks (probably from the dishwash liquid and using towels to dry my car... I know, I know tsktsk)
* I have white decals all over the sides of my car. They're birds of varying shapes and sizes so its a bit difficult to use products that can't be put on the decals.
* I'm willing to spend what I need to in order to get great quality products but I am a starving student, so nothing too expensive please!

New black truck problems.,INSERT_CATCHPHRASE,5,1,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/1inmh1/newbie_here_i_have_some_questions_new_black_truck/,"I just traded for a new truck. It just rained here the other day and having my first NICE vehicle I wanted to wash it right. I didn't know there was this subreddit, so I not knowing anything, went to autozone and bought some Meguiers soap, leather cleaner, and wipes (interior) and a Simonz microfiber towel. I was relatively happy with the leather cleaner and soap but the interior wipes didn't seem as good as they should have been (streaking). I know these may be dumb questions but as I know nothing about interior/exterior PROPER care for a vehicle I want to ask the following questions. 

TL;DR Start HERE:

What are the best interior wipes? Or should I have gotten the spray to prevent streaking?

Is Meguires a reputable brand? (I only bought it because the bottles looked professional and it was slightly more expensive, I know nothing about any brands so I figured it was a safe bet.)

How do I stop the water spots? Even hitting it with the towel after isn't getting all of them.

The truck does have some small, shallow scratches, not into the paint just the clear coat. Is there anything I can do?

Should I wax it? I haven't ever waxed anything before, so whats the best wax to use?

Should I clay it? If so how?

I know this is a lot guys. If you don't feel like answering all these possibly dumb questions could you link a reputable site or article. In the three days I have owned (my first) black vehicle I have realized it is a definite responsibility. 

And finally is this even possible for me to pick up or should i just take it to a professional? Note a lot of people with show/very nice daily driver refuse to take their cars to any of the detailers in my town for reason I do not know. All I know is that all of them do not have a good rep regarding doing a good/professional job.
 
Thanks guys.

Now i did a white civic, and it was difficult. The hardest part was getting the dirt off. As soon as i spray soap using foam gun, or hand wash it with lots of soap, the dirt wouldnt budge. It then used the method of spraying water as im applying soap to the panel and then the dirt finally went away. 

anyways, i decided to go for a compound, polish and a wax, and im a bit stumped. I had lots of swirls all over the car, and i tried a small section first. btw im using a da polisher (meguiars). so i tried a polishing pad with compound first, and it was ok, then tried the compound pad with compound and it worked well. 
Heres where im confused, the two pics below show the difference now, and im unhappy :( after much hard work.
i used meguiars ultimate compound then polish.

I looked through the big list of car-related subreddits and this was the closest match I can find.

I have a brand new car with a pristine trunk lined with... felt cloth or something like it. The back seats fold down 60/40 for extra space if I need it. I need to put a lot of wet, sandy gear (kitesurfing gear) back there all the time, and, unlike my last car, which ended up completely disgusting, wet, and filled with sand, I want to take better care of this one. So I'm trying to figure out how to water/sand proof it, up the sides of the trunk as well (so the all-weather rubber mat trunk liners you can get won't fully cut it), while still allowing the back seats to fold down. Anybody have ideas for an easy, elegant mod?

At first I just threw two giant [sterilite boxes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MPQ91C) back there, which (after a tiny bit of trimming) almost perfectly filled the entire trunk, but my gear is taller than the edge and can flop over, and also sand don't care about no boxes - it goes everywhere.

Now I have a trunk-sized piece of painter's plastic sheet that I've laid back there, taped all the way up the sides, with the plastic boxes on top. This seems to be mostly working, except that it looks super ghetto, the tape keeps falling off the felt (or whatever the trunk and back-of-seats is lined with), and it RUSTLE RUSTLE RUSTLES. I was thinking of getting a big sheet of rubber (not sure you can get sheets of rubber wide enough), but then still not sure how to attach it to the car (I would want this solution to be removable so I can clean it, or just take it out in case I don't need it). I was thinking velcro would work (and the hook side of velcro does in fact stick to the felt), but I'm worried about the felt getting completely torn up and ruined after multiple attach/detachings. Maybe I could sew snap buttons on the felt and on a big rubber sheet and then I can just snap the rubber sheet on.

Anybody have a better solution? Anybody know where I can get big thin sheets of rubber? To go up the sides of the trunk and up the backs of the back seats, it looks like I probably need about a 5x5 foot square, maybe more.

I clay barred it a while ago, and did a show car glaze soak to condition the paint. Then sealing in the polish with wax. It's come time again to do the process all over, but I want to know if I'm doing it right.. All hand washed, hand polished.

I never took ""after"" pictures, I only got the ""before"" ones. As you can see the car has sap and grime and is just overall filthy as it has been sitting  under a tree for a month as we built a new motor for it.


After washing it it came out clean but it is extremely faded and I've been trying to decide what order and products I should go about using. You can see the hood and all but one fender are pink instead of the red like the rest of the car. My objective is to wash, clay, cut/buff 
(or whatever it takes) to get this paint in better condition. The whole car should look like the one good fender, and the roof.

Also for giggles don't link me to the person who restored the paint on the prelude a couple weeks ago from pink to red as well as the other person who had a faded chalkboard red hood on his ford I think it was. 


I'm looking for advice, experiences, critiques and basically anything you can throw at me. How would you hobbiest detailers and professionals correct this paint if it is even possible?

I spent about two days on this car. The first day I tackled the interior, and the exterior was done the next day. The outside of this thing was pretty trashed, and what you see in the before pictures is AFTER it was run through an automatic tunnel car wash. The car went for service at the Honda dealer and said they will wash it for free. I told them not to touch it. They ""washed"" it anyways...

Since this car is white, and the owner does not care at all about the car looks, I opted for only a very quick, light polish. Here's the process:

1. [Wheels](http://imgur.com/a/ece4E#8woTClJ). Clean the wheels with Meg's Wheel Brightener and a Daytona Speed Master Jr brush. Wheel Brightener is harsh, and it turned out I didn't need to use something so harsh because the brake dust nearly came off with just water. Tires and wheel wells were scrubbed with some Simple Green APC.

2.  Car was foamed and left to dwell for 2-3 minutes. Then pressure washed off.

3. Car was washed with Meg's Gold class wash and the two-bucket method, and then clayed with Mother's clay.

4. Taped off a [test spot](http://i.imgur.com/Ae4WTvC.jpg) on the hood to dial in my quick polish process. I didn't want to spend a lot of time polishing this even though it needed a heavy compound. You can see that my test spot is rather large because I was planning on moving the polisher faster and covering larger areas at one time.

5. I opted for [M205](http://i.imgur.com/fWXf7V2.jpg) on a [Lake Country white pad](http://i.imgur.com/sFCI0yM.jpg). I only did 1 section pass with an arm speed of about 1.5x. This was enough to remove the [embedded dirt and grime and restore some ""whiteness""](http://i.imgur.com/Z5CKWwr.jpg) to the paint, as well as a bit of clarity. [Before](http://i.imgur.com/Kx69HrH.jpg) and [after](http://i.imgur.com/tttKYIs.jpg).

6. After polishing, I did some quick work to the exhaust tips (sorry for lack of pics!) using Eagle One Nevr Dull. 

7. Next came the 50/50 IPA wipedown to get rid of any polishing residue left on the paint from the M205.

A few months ago I went out and bought some products to detail my car, but now that I've been reading more I realise that I may have made some bad choices.

I don't have an electric buffer, so I will apply all products by hand. The car is in reasonable condition, but has some light scratches in places.

Can you please let me know if my current products are fine, and give any advice?

**Wash:** I had really cheap supermarket wash+wax, but now after reading I bought some Triplewax Liquid Gold. I also just bought a microfiber washmit and plan to dry with microfibre towels and use two buckets.

**Clay:** I didn't have a clay kit, 	so after reading up I just bought a Meguiars Clay Bar kit.

**Polish:** I own some Autoglym Super Resin Polish.  I've read that this product is okay, but that it's not very abrasive/'corrective'.  I'm not sure if this is the best product to use for polishing to fix any imperfections.  I also just bought microfiber applicator pads instead of using a microfiber towel.

**Scratch removal:** For deeper scratches that the polish doesn't work on, I have T-cut Rapid Scratch Remover.  I'd reapply the polish after using this to restore the shine in the area.

**Wax:** I already have Turtlewax original wax.  I just read the sidebar's 'Beginners guide to detailing products: the bare minimum supplies.,' and spellrm mentions to stay away from anything produced by Turtlewax.  As with the Autoglym polish, I have pretty much a full bottle of it left, so would prefer to use it unless its really useless.

I want to clay/wax the car before I leave home and the car has to sit outside in the SW FL sun all day. Though I do cover it if I know I either wont use it that day (extremely rare) or wont use it till late in the day.



I was going to go the Meguiars route (I am a huge fan of their products) but I saw Zymol in Advanced auto while picking up some oil change supplies and purchased that because I thought I remembered hearing it was a good brand. 



Guys, what should I do to protect my black car from the Florida sun? I am ok with returning the Zymol. Though I do already have Meguiars clay bar kit and Meguiars ultimate wax (paste) in the garage. I am ok with buying more product if it is within reason (broke college student here, but I always try to give my car the best no matter what).",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,False,,,True,t3_xip6n,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/xip6n/zymol_or_meguiars_advice_wanted_for_care_before/,

Does anyone here have a car cover they can recommend that's waterproof? I know it won't be perfect, but anything to keep the rain/snow off the car when its outside would be perfect. It seems like a lot of covers are mostly just protecting from UV rays and not so much from precipitation.",,False,self,t5_2sjf8,False,,,True,t3_wurh4,http://www.reddit.com/r/AutoDetailing/comments/wurh4/weatherproof_car_covers/,
