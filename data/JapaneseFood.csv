First she was diagnosed with cancer and so had to cut back on her blogging while she goes through treatment. Just after she found that out, her father died.  Now, according to her [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/#!/makiwi), she just got back from NYC (I believe to attend her father's memorial) and discovered that her home had been broken into, and years of her data has been stolen, as well as cooking equipment and so much more. Her and her husband had just moved into this beautiful farmhouse in France last year and were working on renos, and then this happens. I feel terrible for her, her blog is so fun and interesting - thought I'd mention it here so people could send their well-wishes to her on twitter, I believe that's the best way of communicating with her right now.  :(",,False,self,t5_2rncq,False,,,True,t3_px6s0,http://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/px6s0/makiko_itohs_bad_luck_keeps_coming/,

I'm wondering if anyone is in the know about the industry, or knows anyone in the know about the industry, or can just point me in a constructive direction. Any good books on the subject? Any good stories about the personal drama between individuals in the business? Ultimately I want to write about this; right now I'm just looking to research as much as possible.

They certainly aren't the touristy-types, and the menus are often entirely in Japanese/Korean/Chinese etc). One thing I've noticed--and LOVE--is that there is no kids menu. Our 2yo eats whatever we eat: udon and tofu, veggies and fish, rice and pickles. But it's lead me to question what childhood food and etiquette looks like, especially in Japan (since it's probably the cuisine we eat most often, and we'd really like to be polite). Is there ""kids food"" and ""adult food"" the way there is in most restaurants in America? What would a similar aged toddler in Japan be eating? Also, how and when is it appropriate to start teaching our daughter to use chopsticks? Anything else we should know? 
Thanks in advance, Reddit!

Edit: Thanks so much for the recommendations-those kiddie chopsticks hopefully will help some with her frustration at not being able to eat like the adults. All the dish names were really helpful too--my husband and I don't speak or read Japanese and usually either point at pictures or guess and enjoy our ""surprise"" meal ;) 

Edit: Thank you all so much for the replies. We'll have to pick up a pair of the kiddie chopsticks that you've  recommended--hopefully that will help with her frustration.

This last try, my closest so far, was using pork tenderloin and pressure cooking it with homemade dashi, shoyu, mirin, garlic, ginger, negi, onion, chillies etc.

Even when I pressure cooked it for 2 hours the color on the inside of the meat was not right and it wasn't fatty/soft enough. I have to say the broth was amazing though, like tonkotsu shoyu ramen broth. 

I'm wondering if I'm using the right cut of meat (or even type of pork.. the markets near my house don't have kurobuta).

Mark at NoRecipes suggests using ton-toro (pork cheek) and while I know that must be delicious, I don't think that's what the ramen shops are using, just by the shape of the slices.

I still have 2 packets left and I was told that if I mix it with other things then I may be able to tolerate it. If I recall on Japanese TV someone had recommended putting honey in it, which seems really odd considering it's a more savoury dish. Do you have any recommendations for what to add to it next time?

This recipe is for a normal Japanese-style curry, without using a mix or anything.  It's a vegetarian recipe (vegan if you don't use oyster sauce), but you could put some meat in with the veggies and I'm sure it would still be good!

Here's my translation: feel free to correct me if you think I did something wrong!

""I managed to make a normal curry without using a curry  mix!  I didn't use any meat or soup mix but it's still plenty thick and delicious.  Use whatever vegetables you want.  It's very easy to make.  Please try this recipe for normal curry that you can finish in 15 minutes!

Ingredients (for one-person serving)
-Whatever veggies you want: All together about 2 cups
-Salt: 1/4 tsp
-Olive Oil: 1 tsp
-Wheat Flour: 1 tbsp

(Seasoning)
--Ketchup: 1 tbsp
--Oyster Sauce (or some vegan substitute): 1 tbsp
--Curry powder: 1/2 tbsp
--Sesame puree (Tahini): 1/2 tbsp

-Rice


1)
Cut whatever vegetables you want to use into large bite-size pieces, put them in a pot and mix them up with the oil and salt.

2)
Cover and heat, first on high heat, then bring it down to low heat after steam starts to rise and heat for another 3 minutes.  While the vegetables are still crispy, add the flour and get a coating of it on everything.

3)
Add 1 cup of water and bring to a boil on high heat, then lower the heat and let it simmer.  (note: If you increase the recipe for a large batch, you might not need/want 1 cup x however much you've multiplied it.  I multiplied everything by 8 when I did this, but only about 5 cups even fit in the pot, and I thought it was totally fine.  Just add enough to get your veggies mostly under water.)
When the vegetables have been cooked enough to get soft, add the ingredients from the ""Seasoning"" section, simmer for about another 3 minutes, and then make any desired seasoning adjustments and you're done.  Serve over rice and enjoy.""

Happy cooking!  I'd be interested to know if you try it and have any extra pointers.  I thought it was pretty good when I made it; it nails the Japanese curry taste and texture really well.",,False,self,t5_2rncq,False,,,True,t3_ebncz,http://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/ebncz/hey_rjfood_i_translated_a_vegetarian_japanese/,

Since we had a good idea of what went into Tsukune, we kind of winged it and based it on recipes from [eatingwell.com](http://www.eatingwell.com/recipes/japanese_meatballs.html) and [JapanFoodAddict.com](http://www.japanfoodaddict.com/pork/tsukune/) for the sauce.

Very rough measurements resulted in a recipe like this:

* 2 lbs ground chicken
* 1 cup panko
* 5 shiitake mushrooms (stems removed)
* 1 egg
* Chopped scallions
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 1 tsp ground black pepper
* 2 tsp grated ginger
* 2 tsp garlic powder
* 2 tsp honey
* Canola oil for cooking
-Mix well and roll into balls or small patties

For the tare sauce:

* 1 ½ tsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp mirin
* 1 tsp sake
-Glaze tsukune with tare as cooking and once again after cooking

Tried cooking on a tabletop electric grill (not great) and frying in a pan using canola oil (better).  Still not exactly the same as a traditional izakaya, but a fun night regardless.

Years ago, I lived and taught English in Japan in a nice little suburb outside of Tokyo. Every once in a while, my reminiscences take me back to the little ramen shack around the corner from my house, whose name I've long since forgotten, and the phantom flavours of half-remembered dishes dance around my tongue and fill me with longing for a taste of the distant past.

While I do miss the chewy noodles and the savoury broth and the buttery pork, what stands out foremost in my mind is... the cabbage. Or, more accurately, キャベチャ, a simple side dish of chopped cabbage tossed with bits of chyashu and a drizzle of sauce. The kyabecha I ate there was satisfyingly crunchy, exceedingly salty, and umami as hell - an extra-special treat whenever I was lucky enough to chance upon it's rotation on the menu.

Years later, nostalgia has elevated my esteem of this unassuming dish to such lofty heights that I'm beginning to suspect that I've imagined half its qualities and embellished the rest. I almost dare not seek it out for fear that the reality could never live up to the Platonic ideal in my mind. And yet, seek it I must, for I've been watching Alton Brown's cabbage episode and deep-seated cravings - long dormant - have been unleashed.

So I turn to you, dear Foodit. My Google-Fu has not been sufficient to turn up any recipe in English and my severely limited language skills preclude my reading of Japanese sites and...

...and I just noticed that there's a Japanese Food subreddit.

They were all fans of Andrew Zimmern and wanted to follow his footsteps by visiting the infamous shop ""Asadachi."" I was scheduled to fly to China the next day, so I had nothing planned that night. I decided to tag along. Being the only of them that could read and speak Japanese, they didn't mind having me around either.

Asadachi, located in a back alley of Shinjuku called ""Omoide-yokocho,"" is what's known as a ""getemono"" specialty shop. Getemono in this instance might be best defined as ""weird shit."" More literally, it means strange things. The word ""asadachi"" itself is actually slang for ""morning wood.""

The items in this shop are supposed to give the eater increased sexual energy. I don't know how strong the links are, but I suspect the ideas professed by the owner are connected to Chinese medicine.
When my friends and I arrived at the shop, the very narrow first floor, consisting of a bar with about 6 or 7 stools, was completely full. However, it appeared there was a narrow staircase to a second floor, so I asked if we could go up there. I led the way and squeezed past the Japanese customers on the first floor. As I realized what the second floor looked like, I couldn't help laughing. The walls were covered in pictures of horses having sex. There were bottles of homemade snake liquor on the floor all around us. At that point, I knew this was going to be a special night.

The original goal was to order the frog course as Andrew Zimmern had done on his show. In that course, you pick out a live frog. Then, you are served a sashimi course, a frog stew, and its beating heart. However, frogs are in season from May to October and we were there in March.

Not to be defeated, I begin picking items off the menu for us to try. I started with some chicken wings and beer, while we tried to summon the courage for more exotic delicacies. We then moved on to our first weird item: raw sliced pig testicles mixed with scallion and raw egg. It was chewy and not very appetizing, but the pork flavor was still present and kept this from being the most revolting dish.

Our second and third weird dishes were horse sashimi and whale sashimi, but dishes that I had tried before. I'm actually a big fan of horse sashimi, but the quality of the meat here was not very good. The whale was too chewy and too fishy to be able to enjoy. The final weird dish that night was shirako, which is the sperm sack of a fish (in this case, cod). It was also served raw. It was slimy, kind of milky, and a bit fishy. One of the worst things I've eaten, but damn exquisite compared to hakarl.

I apologize for the quality of the pictures, but I hope you enjoy them and the story.

As an appendix to the main story, in China the next day I started telling this story to a Chinese friend while at a neighborhood kebab joint. I guess this sparked a bit of Chinese nationalistic pride so he called the waitress over and ordered sheep penis and ox penis. Thank Mao they were out of ox dicks. The sheep penis wasn't bad, though.

I made what has to be the best Sushi I've ever eaten at the weekend, quite remissed I didn't take a picture to share.

Although I've put far east and wild west above this chilli has a distinct mediterranean style to it.

I started off boiling some Camargue rice in a vegetable stock with a couple of torn bay leaves, I thought the red colouring would work well in the futomaki I was planning on making - matching the redness of it's contents. I find Camarague is normally quite tough (like wild rice) so I let it boil for a while longer than normal before draining and adding a mix of Mirin and sugar (boiled until the sugar's reduced into the rice wine) - left it on the side whilst I made the chilli.

For the chilli I had to do two batches, the sushi was going to be a surprise gift at my friends birthday garden party where her husband was already serving three different chilli's - my friend's a vegetarian and I'm not so for her benefit (and other veggies there) I made a split batch.

I started off frying some diced red onion in a wok with a little balsamic vinegar instead of oil (for both flavour and healthier), once the onion's sweated a little I'd normally add the meat but skipped straight to the long thin red pepper, normal yellow pepper and spring onion.

Let them cook a little before adding some tomato's - I cheated and used a pre-diced tomato pack, well two, one with added olives and the other with oregeno, added a tin of mixed beans in chilli sauce, another thin of mixed pulses in water (drained) and four large cloves of garlic (crushed in my trusty garlic press). Torn sundried tomatos, a couple of hefty teaspoons of red pesto and a generous dash of soy sauce and a good splosh of red wine. Some diced taragon and then some broken dark chocolate (90% coco). And a chilli mix packet - try as I may I've never been able to get the flavour right mixing my own spices, plus this is way easier.

The base ready I let simmer whilst in another wok I stir fried a sliced chorizo ring (about 1cm cuts) - when it was sealed I poured half the chilli base into the chorizo pan adding some king prawns to the meat pan and green lentils to the veg option.

Once the chilli's had thickened up and were done I let them cool. As I wanted them to go well for the party I got my friend who was staying to do the rolling as she's much more experienced than I. She filled the nori as normal, the rice spread well and then picked out the chorizo and prawns along with the peppers and sun dried toms especially for the meat rolls but kept enough of the sauce in.

I left them to cool and congeal a bit before cutting the rolls, in fact I put the rolls into separate tinfoil wraps and didn't cut them until I got to the party as my concern was the chilli may run but it turned out well in the end.

Recently I've been to a couple of Japanese food places where I've ordered Chicken Katsu Donburi. They've been delicious, but they seem to have this kind of sweet sauce that's poured on top of the chicken katsu. It's not tonkatsu sauce, it's sweeter than that. Also, it's not the sauce that comes with making the egg-omelette mix, it has a stronger, sweeter-ish taste than that. 

I really really want to find out what that sauce is because it makes it so delicious!

If it actually is the sauce that comes from making the egg-part of the donburi, I'd love to hear a recipe, because the oyako don/katsu don recipes that I know of create a sauce that is lighter in taste.

I always get organic, sushi-grade fish from this very nice local fish monger, and I think I've gotten pretty good at the slicing. While I definitely prefer my homemade sushi to cheap take-out, it is still never quite the same as when I get sushi in nice restaurants.

I'm even curious if there is a right temperature at which to keep the fish leading up to using it. I always get it and use it the same day, and I typically keep it in the refrigerator for at least a few hours before making it. I usually take it out, rinse it and let it get to room temperature while I make the rice.

This is my first experience of real Japanese cooking though, so I don't feel bad.

1) I can't get the udon hot enough, and keep them that way. When I ate this dish in Japan, the udon would always be on the verge of too-hot-to-eat after serving, for a good 5 minutes too, at the bottom of the bowl. When I cooked it, the noodles were luke-warm at best on serving. I heated the bowls with boiled water, too.

2) As a consequence, the egg did not even slightly boil, which made the eventual taste and consistency a little disappointing. One place I ate kamatama udon seemed to have a special way of preparing the egg which whitened the albumin, without really cooking the egg, so it was still mixable and essentially raw.

So I've been bit of a nerd of chinese tea for a while now and finally got around to ordering my first sencha and matcha a while ago.

1. I've heard a Kyusu is designed to be ""wiggled"" when steeping sencha. Is this true? How should I wiggle it? I'm not interested in going full tea ceremony, but I do like a slight ceremonial touch to it so even if it doesn't do anything I'm interested in the proper way.

2. How much is one matcha scoop? I have a susudake, but depending on how you use it you can go ±50% or something from a mean amount of tea.

IIRC, it was a brown paperback book in an odd size, probably 8"" wide and 4"" tall.  All the drawings and illustrations were hand-drawn.  This was a modern book, probably printed in the '70's or '80's I would guess judging by the style of the illustrations and the printing and when I bought it. 

I've looked high and low for this book, and can find no trace of it.  Amazon, Bookfinder.com, B&amp;N, Borders, etc.  It's almost like it never existed.

Had this with two friends today at a Japanese restaurant here in Göteborg/Gothenburg (Sweden). It was amazing, everyone was very happy with the food.

I have a question though that's been bugging me. Everytime I get hands on some Japanese food, which is usually pretty expensive or hard to get by here, I send a picture to my host father in Japan and my best Japanese friend. They both usually enjoy getting these photos but today's reply from my friend really got on my nerves as one of those ""annoying japanese moments"".

First he asked me if that was soy sauce and I said that no it was not. Then he continued that sukiyaki should be eaten with sukiyaki sauce and every japanese can tell the difference just by looking (even though the ones running this restaurant actually looked like she was japanese), plus sukiyaki with broccoli is apparently unheard of.

Finishing of his reply he said that japanese food probably ought not be eaten outside of Japan as it might give one the wrong idea. This kind of attitude, I think unfortunately quite common in Japan, annoys the hell out of me.

Now to my question, japanese or not, would you say this is sukiyaki or not? I've had sukiyaki at two restaurants in Sweden, one here in Göteborg and one in Stockholm, and they both seem to use the same kind of sauce so I'm guessing that much is right (probably imported from Japan).",,False,self,t5_2rncq,False,,,True,t3_clp65,http://www.reddit.com/r/JapaneseFood/comments/clp65/sukiyaki_at_a_swedish_restaurant_two_pictures/,

I mean, I can make a similar curry /put together a pretty good dish, but I feel as if something is missing from the curry itself.  I am aware of variations of curry udon, and that the curry is often poured over udon and a separate broth.

The main problem: curry roux works well except for the fact that they all seem to contain MSG, which makes me sick to my stomach /nauseated.  Occasionally I hazard it, but feeling that pukey for 1-2 hours is something I'd really like to avoid.  I understand that curry roux was a relatively recent invention after the Japanese started modifying their version of curry, so there must be someone who knows a way to either replicate curry house curry, or make it ""from scratch,"" as they say.  I have searched high and low, and pretty much all recipes for Japanese curry are based on curry roux.  The couple I found that did not use roux were not very good recipes, in my opinion.  

Does anyone know how to replicate, or how to go about replicating Japanese curry (specifically curry udon, but if I can make the former, I am sure the rest are derivative) *without* curry roux?  Or maybe some tips?  Thanks.

Im sure we've seen all those golden Japanese curries and one thing that ive noticed is that they're all very flavorful and not like indian curries or chinese curries. They're much more darker, brownish, (sweet?), saucy, and almost like a stew.

- Are there recommended brands to use for this? (I have a brand called Golden Curry, and i want it to look like that dark brown deliciousness.)

- What veggies can i put in it/how much/how well cut? I have used carrots, potatoes, onions. For potatoes i notice they all disintegrate into the curry and turn it into mashed potatoes :( (i boiled the potatoes beforehand)

- I dont know how many cubes to use! the curry may smell right but the color is too light, and the flavor too little.. Is there a recommended amount

- Saute onions first or cook them in curry? same with meat?

- Can someone suggest a simple, easy to follow way to make that golden curry? ( i guess this would answer all the questions above)

Im a noob at this, so pointers, tips, etc would be greatly appreciated. I know i could have looked this up but i always feel confused unless the tips are pointed towards me, so please bear with me.

So is Shyabu Shyabu but I can make that myself, Kirimochi is something I can't make easily.

I had studied abroad in Japan a few years ago, and I was hoping someone might be able to identify a really delicious seasoning I remember sprinkling over rice/onigiri.

I specifically remember having it while staying at a camp in Isahaya, Nagasaki, so I don't know if it was a regional thing...?

It came in little packets as a condiment that you could tear open and shake over your food, but was not found in bigger containers and I could not find for sale at any store. 

The packaging design was very minimalist, with little description, and was orange/yellow and had a picture of a fish on it. 

The flavor was very savory/salty and may have contained seaweed. Most of the contents was fine granules, like pepper.

Any and all help is appreciated! Sorry if I was vague, that's really all there was to it!

I like to feel the full experience, though, so I'd like to have around what's generally in use in Japan even down to the kitchenware. Specifically I was looking for some bowls, or I guess more specifically I had a craving for donburi, but really I'm asking in general, what do I need to get started on typical Japanese kitchenware and where can I get it?

I was looking on Amazon(.co.jp) and saw some stuff that I liked (like [these](http://www.amazon.co.jp/SARA-CERA-甘～いきつねうどん丼ぶり-窯変/dp/B0039M9WAU/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;s=kitchen&amp;qid=1279304523&amp;sr=1-17)) but almost all of the stuff says it won't ship outside of Japan and I can't find any mention of that brand (Sara-Cera) anywhere.

Love to hear advice on what to buy. Thanks!

Why do I know?  I live about 5 minutes walk from Toriki and go there at least once a month, more if I have out of town guests.

Totally different interior, menu and chef, plus at Toriki he cooks on hot coals waving a big Japanese fan to maintain the heat evenly.  Using an electric grill would be somewhat of a sacrilege there, hardly befitting of the Michelin one-star status they have maintained for some time now.

Try this website next time for the right place:

Good luck finding Toriki next time, and if you do make it there I really recommend the junmai nihonshu from Aichi-ken - one of the nicest, crispest sakes I have ever tried and goes very well with the food.

A day or so later my friend suggested ""We should go get some manjuu."" in which he meant we should eat at the nikuman place again. 

It confused me because in my mind manjuu refers to wagashi style snacks, and nikuman is generally meat in steamed bread (buns). I'd sooner consider daifuku as manjuu than nikuman. This lead to a small argument.

He then said nikuman is short for niku-manjuu and majuu is the Japanese reading of the Chinese ""mantou"", which in Chinese cuisine is any steamed buns with any kind to no fillings. He also pointed out in Japanese cuisine there are things like kareman and anman and that they're all manjuu.

While I feel he might be technically correct, I've never heard of anyone refer to nikuman as manjuu. I see it analogous to referring to a hamburger as a sandwich.

Without this getting into a what panko is and isnt debate does anyone have any tips on making panko at home from leftover bread? 

Currently what I am doing is trimming the crusts, slicing the bread up and then lightly blitzing the bread into a medium crumb with some slightly bigger bits (I can get a photo later if wanted) and then spreading it on a baking tray and leaving in the oven at a very low heat to remove the moisture. 

Not sure how authentic this actually is but surely before modern tech came to japan housewives and chefs had a way to prepare it at home or in the kitchen? Does anyone have any experience of this?

I had a WOK for Christmas per request and now, I'm looking at it wondering ""what could I do in that"". I know I can cook anything in it, but I want WOK recipe like yakisoba and stuff like that.

I don't eat fish, shrimps and those sort of food (I hate the taste of all of those, tried many combination) but I'm open to beef, noodle, chicken, etc.

I had many cooking books for Christmas, but none for WOK. I'm in the process of buying one but sometime the best recipes aren't in book but in other people mind.

I most say I never cooked with a WOK, but I do have cooking knowledge, it's not my debut.

Oh yeah, I have a nonstick WOK. I ask for one that was plain iron but they mistaken with a nonstick one. Because of that, I can't do high heat cooking.

I usualy go to a japanese place that do delicious yakisoba with beef and it might be one of the first I'd try, but I'm open to suggestion from this wonderful community :D

Here in lies my question....does anyone know a recipe that does NOT use the pan to make Takoyaki?""

I recently went back to the restaurant and looked at the name of it. All they called it was ""Takoyaki Cake"". Is there any recipe that would follow something like this? Really its tastes JUST like the balls but its flat, flaky and so damn good (like I said just like the balls) and of course less doughy.

I know we don't usually get into political conversations here but I am doing an up coming story for The North American Post and as fellow Japanese food lovers I wanted your take on the issue of whaling. 

So what do you think? Do the Japanese have a right to whaling because of their culture? Do you think they are abusing their privileges of whaling? Do you think organizations like  Sea Shepherds, Green Peace etc have the right to protest and intervene in whaling activities? 

Have you ever had whale? If presented with whale would you eat it? 
I would like clear honest opinions. Please though no rants. Include a little background about yourself if you think that would help. But by no means do you have to. 

Just please take note I am doing this as part of research for an upcoming article in The North American Post so you could be quoted. If you wish not to be quoted directly please let me know.

I was in Japan in 2007 and for part of my trip we went to Miyajima Island. My friends and I ate dinner at a restaurant there and I absolutely loved the dish that I had, but I can't remember the name. It was thin beef slices with, I believe, onions on top of rice. It was cooked to be hot enough that they would crack an egg over it before bringing it out and the egg would cook just from the heat of the beef. I'm sorry that my memory's a bit fuzzy, but I've been trying to remember ever since so I can try to find a recipe to make this on my own.

Also, dogs. I am a super dog person, and cannot ever imagine eating one. I'm not trying to be ignorant or anything, but do they actually serve it in restaurants in Japan? If so, how do I avoid it at all costs?
