I first became so interested in Hellenistic warfare specifically because of Rome: Total War. I found very difficult to dig up accurate information on Greek soldiers from after the death of Alexander the Great in more than little snippets. I've pieced together as much information as I could find, and I think I've put together a pretty good picture of how things developed, altogether. I hope /r/totalwar appreciates this.

 - In the Beginning

In classical antiquity, Greek armies were based almost entirely around the [hoplite](http://i.imgur.com/nlPEh.jpg), which was a very heavily armored spearmen with a large hoplon shield. Poorer Greeks would fight as [unarmored hoplites](http://i.imgur.com/TfWll.jpg). The poorest acted as unarmored skirmishers using [slings](http://i.imgur.com/OA0Di.jpg) or [javelins](http://i.imgur.com/UnOsH.jpg). When the Greeks engaged [Thracians](http://i.imgur.com/NNMNy.jpg) in battle, they found themselves unable to really answer their style of aggressive skirmishing, so they hired Thracians into their armies! Greeks themselves started using this style of fighting as [peltasts](http://i.imgur.com/nPJd8.jpg). As time went on, the hoplite's panoply changed. By the Peloponnesian War, they used [lighter linothorax armor](http://i.imgur.com/g6zYAh.jpg).

 - Iphicrates's Reforms

Then along came Iphicrates, an Athenian general tasked with reforming the city's army. Some of the changes he made stuck, others did not. He gave peltasts a [slightly heavier panoply](http://i.imgur.com/L9noM.gif), with a helmet and larger shield for greater protection at little cost in weight, and gave them spears for fighting in close combat. This change stuck, and became nearly universal for peltasts, who made up the bulk of mercenaries within Greece. By Alexander the Great's time, ""peltast"" became a generic term for mercenaries. Iphicrates also lightened [some hoplites'](http://i.imgur.com/P1Y3v.gif) kit, giving them smaller shields, longer spears, and lighter linen armor. This did not stick, but it influenced a guy named Philip.

 - Philip II

King Philip II of Macedon took the throne with Macedon's army was mostly built around the [cavalry](http://i.imgur.com/jxIHc.jpg), and its infantry were mostly light troops such as peltasts. The king set out to reform his army based on what he had learned from the victorious Thebans (he received a military education while held hostage in Thebes) and from what he learned from Iphicrates, who he may have known personally. He gave his soldiers very, very long spears and small shields, creating the famous [Macedonian phalanx](http://i.imgur.com/bXcv6.jpg). However, Philip's infantry were unarmored, and for sieges or skirmishes they could leave their pikes behind and take javelins instead, acting like peltasts. His elite infantry were the [hypaspists](http://i.imgur.com/kDG01h.jpg), unarmored, but protected by large shields and helmets, and fighting with sturdy spears. They could hold the line in a pitched battle or move quickly in skirmishes. With his troops equipped like this and his army well disciplined and organized, he turned Macedon into the dominant power in the Balkans.

 - Alexander and His Successors

Philip's son inherited the throne as Alexander III of Macedon, but he would become Alexander the Great. Alexander favored his [companion cavalry](http://i.imgur.com/BsUgV.jpg), but included much more cavalry (Macedonian and Greek) and did not neglect the infantry. As his campaigns went on and his army amassed loot, his soldiers could afford more armor. [Linothorax](http://i.imgur.com/rEXtd.jpg), and later [bronze or iron armor](http://i.imgur.com/E4qtm.jpg), became increasingly common. Alexander used large numbers of mercenaries in his armies as well. Mercenary peltasts, drawn from both Greece and Thrace, as well as his native Macedon, played a major role in his army. Various natives from the regions he conquered also joined his ranks as mercenaries. This set a precedent for his successors, who used mercenaries extensively. The Greek rulers of non-Greek lands hired soldiers from the Balkans (and encouraged them to settle in their empires) to build their armies, and used native troops to fill out their ranks. Even the army of Macedon wound up a mostly-mercenary army to preserve its professionalism after the organizational genius Philip II was gone.

 - Hellenistic Developments

After Alexander the Great died his successors continued the trend of heavier troops. Encounters with central Asian peoples who used [very heavy cavalry](http://i.imgur.com/Re8Sl.jpg) led them to adopt such heavy armor for [their own cavalry](http://i.imgur.com/x5tc4.jpg). [Peltasts](http://i.imgur.com/gMcnn.jpg) also became heavier. They adopted the thureos shield from the [Celtic peoples](http://i.imgur.com/QRAh5.jpg) who invaded Greece and Anatolia in the 2nd century BC, and came to be known as [thureophoroi](http://i.imgur.com/wYu4e.jpg). Greeks also came to use chain mail armor, first being exposed to it by Celtic Galatians in Anatolia, and then by the Romans who involved themselves in eastern Mediterranean affairs. Thureophoroi-style soldiers started wearing chain cuirasses were called [thorakitai](http://i.imgur.com/KdlQb.jpg), and some [phalangites](http://i.imgur.com/LmCop.jpg) wore mail as well.

 - Regional Variations

Some Greek city-states wound up equipping their citizens as thureophoroi rather than traditional hoplites because their kit was cheaper and still very effective. Others retained traditional hoplites and peltasts for a very long time. Some adopted Macedonian-style phalanxes, and there's at least one instance of a Greek city-state confederation switching from hoplites to thureophoroi and later to phalangites. Macedon itself seemed to use the Macedonian phalanx up until its fall. Macedonian elite troops were called ""peltasts"", but are described in some contemporary sources as fighting in a phalanx, so they may have retained the ability to skirmish as phalangites under Alexander did. The Seleukids and Ptolomies used lots of heavy cavalry and Macedonian phalanxes, but gradually used more and more lighter spearmen such as thureophoroi and thorakitai, while also employing many Galatian mercenaries and native troops. By the time Cleopatra reigned, if not earlier, the Macedonian phalanx totally disappeared.

I definitely missed a few things, so if you notice anything please tell me, and there are also likely quite a few grammar/spelling mistakes, so PMing me those so I can fix them would be great too.

Keep in mind that while these strategies work for most of the TW games, I mostly had Rome and Medieval in mind while writing. They SHOULD apply for Rome 2 as well, but of course there's no way to know that yet.

Anyways, enjoy and I hope this helps you. (Also sorry if the formatting is bad, first time doing reddit formatting!)

Note: After reading the comments I feel there's some things I probably should've clarified in the first place. First, this is mainly meant to be a sort of 'newbie' handbook, so I've purposely avoided putting in anything overly complicated. Secondly, while I do have a fair amount of experience playing TW, I am by no means a master so keep in mind some of my information may be inaccurate. If you spot something you disagree with, feel free to comment with it! I read all the comments so I'll keep suggestions in mind.

**Swords&gt;Spears&gt;Cavalry Rock-paper-scissors formula**

In almost all the Total War Games (With certain obvious exceptions like Empire), the rock-paper-scissors formula, with Swords beating Spears, Spears beating Cavalry and Cavalry beating Swords. Of course, when you throw in archers, morale, flanking, numbers, special abilities, unit quality and other factors you can't simply rely on having the correct 'counter'. However, it is a good formula to always keep in mind as a basic strategy that will work most of the time.

**More in-depth**

Generally the most important thing to watch for when sending a 'counter' is the difference in unit quality. You aren't going to beat an elite unit with a tier 1 fodder unit, even if you're sending swordsmen against spearmen. Another important factor is flanking. Cavalry may lose to spearmen in an even fight, but if you charge them from behind with your cavalry they will die just like a swordsman. If the pointy end isn't pointed towards the enemy it's not going to do much.

**Infantry**

Infantry tend to form the basis of your army, barring extremely specialised or unique circumstances. These are the guys that will hold your line, and fight against the enemies. They tend to be fairly slow (Armour is heavy!) even when running so don't expect these guys to be able to respond quickly to new developments in the battlefield when already engaged in a fight.

I split Infantry into 3 types, Spears, Shock and Heavy.


---*Spears*---

How you use spearmen will depend on a multitude of factors. What game are you playing? Which faction are you playing? Which faction are you fighting? Attacking or defending? In general though, unless your faction has good heavy infantry (Rome is a good example) you want to have spearmen as your front line units to pin down enemies so your other units can move around to flank while taking minimal losses themselves, along with making a frontal cavalry charge suicidal.

If you are playing a faction that uses heavy infantry, you'll be using those as your front line. You'll still want a few units of spearmen on the flanks though, to guard against cavalry moving around to flank or get at your archers, which the ai likes to do when it isn't suiciding them in a stupid frontal assault on your spears. Keep them out of battle until the enemy cavalry is neutralised, and have them ready to intercept.

---*Special – Phalanx*---

The Phalanx (AKA The Giant Invincible Pointy Spear Wall of Doom) is a unit comprising of a bunch of guys with very long spears standing really close together, keeping their spears pointed forwards. A frontal assault on a phalanx unit is suicide 90% of the time. They have a major weakness, however, in the flanks and rear, as these parts of the Phalanx have no pointy things to stab into the enemy, making them a prime target for cavalry to slaughter.

When using the Phalanx, you want to let the enemy come to you whenever possible. Let them try to break through your impenetrable wall and laugh. However, keep in mind that the Phalanx needs to be supported to be effective. You need men to guard their flanks and also to flank the enemy (They wont kill the enemies themselves), along with cavalry to neutralise the enemy cavalry. Alone, they will easily get surrounded and killed.

---*Shock*---

Shock infantry are your barbarians, your katana wielding samurai and basically anything that does a large amount of damage, preferably with a large charge bonus. Keep these men behind your spearmen on the flanks to stay safe against cavalry, as they generally have a lack of armour. Keep them safe until your spears or heavy infantry have the enemy pinned down and then move these guys to the flanks or rear, charge them in and watch the enemies fall like flies. Their role can be mostly interchangeable with cavalry, though they can hold the front lines in a pinch, and tend to continue to fight effectively even after the initial charge.

However, as mentioned before, keep these guys away from enemy cavalry! If you let them get charged you'll likely lose half the unit before you can even react. So before you move them to flank, make sure they wont get flanked in exchange!

---*Heavy*---

Heavy infantry is a rather ambiguous term, as sometimes they may be your front line holders, but sometimes they may be your shock infantry. Good front line heavy infantry will have shields, good armour and preferably good morale and stamina. Good shock will generally have a high attack or charge bonus, along with good armour allowing them to fight better after the charge bonus wears off.

---*Special – Roman Legions*---

(Note: While this SHOULD be applicable to Rome 2, I offer no guarantees)

One word, Pilum. What's a pilum, you ask? The 'javelins' that higher tier Roman legionnaires throw before charging into battle. When thrown by multiple units at once, they are utterly devastating and can easily destroy a unit in several volleys. Make sure to make adequate use of these powerful weapons, as a large part of the strength of the Roman Legionnaires comes from these. Try to use them all up before fighting in melee, and avoid throwing them into clusters of friendly and enemy troops, they'll hit your men just as easily as they'll hit the enemies'.

**Ranged**

Ranged units are there to soften up the enemies from a range, to prepare them for your infantry. Lightly armoured, they rely on their allies and speed to avoid death. Once again, I split them into three main types, but in this case each of them are very different to each other. 

---*Archers*---

Archers are the most heavily used type, and almost every battle will have archers. In fact, if you don't have archers, you suck. When properly used, archers can decimate enemies before they even have a chance to reach you. Keep in mind that in 99% of cases you do not want them fighting in melee combat, and you never want them to be charged by cavalry, as that will almost instantly wipe them out. Keep them guarded well, and they will slaughter your enemies from a range.

If you don't have skirmishers, it is generally best to keep your archers in front of your infantry at the start of the battle, and in loose formation if a missile duel breaks out. Why? Several reasons. It allows them to start shooting at enemies faster, and also draws enemy fire away from your more valuable front line units. Once the infantry lines are about to clash, you can quickly pull them back to a safer position to fire. With skirmishers, however, it is generally best to leave those to draw arrow fire and keep your archers safe and secure.

However, the most important part of using archers is proper target acquisition. When the battle starts, turn off Fire at Will for all your archers. Keeping it on will only waste ammo and cause friendly fire. There are two important things to keep in mind when picking a target:

1) Shoot to the Right

Soldiers hold their shields in their left hand and weapon in their right, so by shooting units to the right of where your archers are, you'll be aiming at the best possible spot for avoiding their shield and hitting their vulnerable body. 

2) They can't dodge what they can't see

You want to shoot in the enemy flanks or back whenever you get the chance, because if they can't see the arrows coming they can't dodge them or block them at all. 

(NOTE: It seems this information is no longer relevant in Shogun 2, as 'defence skill' has been changed to 'Melee Defence'. Probably the same case with Empire as well.)

Simply by keeping these two tips in mind you'll increase kill rates dramatically. There is a huge difference between attacking a heavily armoured unit head on and having most of the arrows dodged or stopped by shields and hitting them in the back and slaughtering them.

Another great target for your archers are the enemy shock infantry. Lightly armoured, but dangerous units are easy prey for your archers, and should be your first priority.

---*Skirmishers*---

Skirmishers are lightly armoured units equipped with a short range weapon such as a sling or a javelin, and they harass the enemy lines to weaken them and break them up. They are very weak to massed archer fire and cavalry, so make sure you keep them away from those. However, they are very cheap so don't be too worried if you have to sacrifice them either.

Generally the best use of skirmishers is first to draw the enemy to your lines (Defending is always better than attacking) and having them draw arrow fire before moving to safety. Once the front lines are fighting, you can pull them around and start throwing any leftover javelins into the backs of your enemies – use the same targeting principles as archers, keeping in mind that javelins are usually armour piercing.

While these guys CAN fight in melee combat, they are pretty terrible at it, so only engage them once they've run out of ammo, and even then try to keep them in a safe position, such as flanking.

Hi all,

For today’s update I will be going into more depth on two areas of the campaign map gameplay. Provinces and regions and how armies and generals work.

**Provinces and regions**

-------
For Rome II we wanted to make an epic scale campaign map, and as part of that we wanted to have more regions than any previous Total War game. Rome II has 183 land regions, the most of any Total War game and almost double the original. To accommodate this we have overhauled how regions work, and also introduced provinces.

A region is a single settlement and the area around it. You can construct buildings, raise armies, recruit agents and manage happiness and taxes for each one. The old resource buildings that existed outside of settlements in Empire, Napoleon and Shogun 2 no longer exist, those resources are now part of settlements.

Provinces are groupings of between 2 and 4 regions. The regions in a province can be owned by individual factions, and can be taken as normal. If you own the whole province then you can pass edicts which provide various bonuses for the province. All the construction options for a province can be managed from a single screen and happiness is also on a province level for a faction. So if you own a province of 3 regions and it has unhappiness problems, the lowest happiness region will rebel but it will be based on the happiness of the province as a whole.

One settlement in each province is the province capital. This has more building slots and has a city siege map when assaulted. The other settlements are minor settlements, their core building reflecting the region speciality and providing bonuses based on that. When a minor settlement is attacked, a normal land battle takes place with the settlement off in the distance.

Both province capitals and minor settlements have garrisons that will defend them if they are attacked.

We’ve made the change that not all settlements provide siege battles due to the sheer number of regions, as we don’t want the game turning into a siege fest. Even in Shogun 2, with its geography that is very good at making battles happen away from settlements, the majority of battles were sieges. With the more open geography of Europe we wanted to make sure that players don’t end up fighting endless siege battles. We also want the siege battles you do fight to be bigger and better than ever before, so making them less frequent but more interesting helps make that happen.

**Armies and generals**

-----

First things first, you cannot have an army without a general and there is a limit to the number of armies you can have at any one time. This limit is tied into how much power a faction has, this works similar to the fame system in Shogun 2.
This limit is being put in place for a variety of reasons. A big one is to make battles more decisive, by having the number of armies limited losing one is a much bigger deal and means, much as you would expect, that a single battle can have a large impact on a war. The introduction of army traditions also makes them more valuable as each can be made unique and having a limit makes each army more precious. It also adds more choices in how you use them, as you must balance how many armies you have attacking and defending to provide enough protection to your nation as well as being able to go on the offensive, and changing that balance depending on the situation at any given moment in a campaign.

You raise an army from a settlement, and then you have to appoint a general to lead it. You then recruit units to it by selecting the army. When recruiting your army will enter muster mode and it cannot move in this stance.

As mentioned in the most recent Rally Point, your army can be named and you can change its emblem. It can also gain traditions as it fights and gets experience.

Generals still have skills and traits. New skills can be chosen as a General gains experience. Traits are given based on what a General does.

As there are no longer resource slots outside of settlements, armies now have a raid stance. This reduces their upkeep. If they are in enemy territory it also gives some money as income, if it is done in friendly territory it additionally causes unhappiness.

Because the number of armies is limited and the automatic garrisons can only protect against so much, the new forced march stance is a great way to move around the campaign map quickly. It gives a large bonus to movement distance, but the army cannot attack that turn and if it is attacked the units in it will suffer a morale penalty.

If an army loses its General a new one can be appointed straight away.


I hope this update answers some of your questions about the campaign, and explains how a lot of the new campaign map features tie into each other to provide a very different and better gameplay experience compared to any previous Total War game.


Cheers,

Jack

##Some questions that got answered on the forums : 
---------

&gt;  *Originally Posted by Daniel_mo:* 
**Hey Jack, How big is a Army Stack? Will Navies work the same way as Armies are tied to a General**

* Max of 20 units in an army. A navy also requires a general

&gt;*Originally Posted by SughdianWarrior:* 
**i.e. Admiral traits/skills and Fleet traditions?**

* Yup.

&gt; *Originally Posted by SamueleD:*
**Thank you for the info Jack Lusted, it made many things clear! I would like to now if navies will be built in a similar way as armies, if they will also have a limit and if admirals will be appointed in a similar way. The number limit on fleets might avoid having a single half sunk low tier warship (like those bow kobayas) blockade an entire port.**

* Yes fleets will work in the same way.


&gt; *Originally Posted by torongill:*  
**Jack, I have a question: In the other forum, the official one, you have said that the maximum number of units in an army is 20. However, in another interview Dom, the campaign lead, said the maximum number of units you can control will be 40(I'll look for the RP episode in question). How does that work out? If both statements are true, would that mean that you, the player, can control two different army stacks? in the same battle? Thanks.**

* Yes just like in FOTS and was later patched into Shogun 2

&gt; *Originally Posted by kamikazee786:*  
**hey jack, quick question here...how will garrisoning work ? we know that each province will have a capital with smaller settlements around it. Will the garrisons of smaller settlements be pre set or can we recruit them ourselves ?**

* The automatic garrisons work the same as in Shogun 2, units in them are base don the buildings you have. You can also have an army protect a settlement as well.

&gt; *Originally Posted by torzsoktamas:*  
**Jack,I have some easy questions regarding the recruitment of armies: 1)As I understand it,..we will recruit whole armies not units!So this means that for example in a turn or two,with a general I will have a full stack?Also how will I choose the unit composition of the army? 2)Will I be able to garrison full stack armies in settlements to protect them?**

* No you still recruit individual units when recruiting for your armies, so you have full control over what units are in them.

&gt; *Originally Posted by MrOuija:*  
**Thanks Jack! One question. If there are 57 siegeable provinces, how many of these are unique or custom locations? Should we expect many in-depth cities like in the siege of carthage video, or just a few with many generic ones?**

* There are a few unique settlements, but Rome II also has the highest number of city maps of any Total War game to date so you will see a large variety on the battlefield.

&gt; *Originally Posted by Modestus:* 
**Just to clarify this is not the terrain in the distance that surrounds a tactical map, if I am on a hill on the campaign map I will be on a hill in the tactical and any other features detailed enough to see on the campaign map will also be on the tactical map.**

* It's the whole terrain in a battlefield. Same was true for non-siege battles in Shogun 2.

&gt; *Originally Posted by PROMETHEUS ts:* 
**I mean if the strategical map is it dynamically linked with the battlefields maps like in Rome ...Like where I place my army and meet the enemy will be represented by the actual terrain I see on the map, like if I place my army on a hill , with sea on left , mountain on right , a wood behind , the road ahead , will this be represented also. On the battlefield? So dynamic battlefields for every point the army is placed in the strategical map.Or instead...Like in Shogun II does not matter where I have my army , if it is in region x the map for field will always be the same , no matter if my army is near the coast, on the hill , in the woods or else... So static battlefields for each strategical map region.**

* Shogun 2 worked on a template system for battlemaps on the campaign, where there would be a number of templates tied to a region and whichever one you were nearest would be used for the battlefield. There were arond 800 of these and they were all done to mirror the geography of the campaign. For Rome II there is basically a giant template map for the entire campaign so the terrain will be picked based on where you fight. Siege maps are also no longer presets, the cities themselves have been made as tiles so the outfield and surrounding terrain will match the campaign map.

^(Spoonska not Jack : Have to go back to work for now. People are getting suspicious. Will update more later.)

I've been lurking here for a long, long time. Long before I had a reddit account. In terms of Total War, I'd imagine I've even played the game longer than most. I picked up Shogun 1 the week it came out, and have bought and played every iteration of the series since. I like to think I'm an incredibly good player at the game, despite avoiding multiplayer, and yet I continuously feel humbled on this sub-reddit.

Any person in this sub-reddit, be it veteran or noob, multiplayer or single player, poor man or rich-man-with-all-DLCs-and-amazing-PC, are accepted. I've seen screenshots taken with a crappy ass camera phone, of a PC run by a potato battery, and because someone was proud of their success and wanted to show people, the sub-reddit congratulated him, asked what happened, and gave him tips for the future. Those who are veterans like myself are never beyond dropping down to their knees to help those who don't know what a flank is, or how to use the new campaign maps, and are always helpful no matter the situation.

Today, I saw a man who couldn't afford Total War, but who asked about it in excitement for the day he'd be able to buy his first Total War game soon get given a FREE copy of Shogun 2 by a sub-reddit member, completely out of the blue.

And that's why I love you, /r/TotalWar. You are by far the best community on Reddit, for your kindness, acceptance and modesty. Every person is accepted here, and I hope that never changes.

Come then my fellow Warlods, witness how attached a grown chap can become to a character in a strategy game, that never had any lines or any character in the game for that matter.


**The prince of glitch**: I was playing EB (Europa Barbarorum) as the Seleucid, i always loved the faction, and at the time having just majored in archaeology and classical studies, i dreamed of creating my own oriental-hellnistic empire. 


Of course, for those who have played as Seleucid's on highest difficulty in EB, know all too well what a kick in the teeth the beginning of the campaign can be. So between 272 and 240 i spent the game abandoning the eastern provinces to consolidate power along the Euphrates and tried to keep the Ptolemaic and the rest of the Greeks, and Anatolians at bay.


And then something strange happened; some kind of glitch or a bug in the files caused one of the young princes named Cassander (at the time 3rd in line after his brother and father) to spawn at the age of 16 along the Dalmatian coasts, to be honest I freaked out, I always loved to make backstories in my head concerning the family tree, and how different factions of the family might vie for control, couple that with the sudden death of Seleucus (2nd in line) at the hand of the aged Ptolemeos II; that put Cassander in line for succession after his father Antiochus.


I couldn't just leave him there now could I? He was a natural born leader and promising commander as well; the boy had something special about him, so I said to meself ""he is getting back to Seleucia"". 
Since my armies were being hit hard all over the empire, a rescue mission was impossible, so if Cassander was to get out, he'd have to do it himself. 


**The Illyrian expedition**: I spent almost the entirety of my treasury on building a mercenary force along the Dalmatian coast, and then begun marching Cassander south, the first conquest for Cassander was Segestica, followed by Dalminion three turns later, I didn't have any plan for these cities, but I fancied an adventure. Soon I arrived on Epidamnos which only recently had revolted against Epirus; Epirus used to be my ally, but 20 years ago backstabbed me and switched sides when Macedon attacked Sardis, I knew that if I wanted to get over the Pindos mountains I had to be on friendly terms with them. So I conquered Epidamnos, and then traded it back to them, for an alliance with military access, the Epirotes happily accepted.
The Aegean now was all but a breath away, and my small navy braved the Greek city states and Macedonian Fleets just so they could ferry Cassander back to Anatolia, or so I thought...


**The battle of Thessaly**: Just before I could reach the coast just north of Demetrias a full stack Macedonian army appeared and blocked my way to the sea, ""damn you Antigonids!"" I howled, there was no way I could beat this battle I thought, as the pre battle speeches showed me the splendor of the Macedonian phalanx. 
My forces were less than half of the enemy, all of them mercenaries and the unit cohesion was a mixed bag. With only two units of Phalangite and the rest a mix of barbarian and Hellenes, I was in a hopeless state of affairs, the only thing I had an advantage over the Macedonians was my cavalry.



The battle raged for a long time, I used my phalangite and few hoplites in a arrow like formation, and thus I let the enemy phalanx almost engulf me, everything depended on my phalanx, if they held long enough, my barbarian troops along with my cavalry would be able to mount a counter attack, hoplite by hoplite my men bravely fell, but they held, they endured, they did so long enough for the initial Macedonian onslaught to stall, and my attack to commence, when the horn of the attack sounded, followed by the ""ipois efodos!"" of my generals bodyguards my adrenaline sky rocketed, the Macedonian general fell and with a swing of my cavalry the enemy Phalangite put to flight. It was a great day but with great casualties, out of the 3000 Macedonians, none returned to Pella, to the embrace of their concubines and the sweet wines of northern Greece, of my 1200 mercenaries only 400 made it.


**Saying goodbyes**: Although a heroic victory it might have been, my coffers were at a breaking point, and those battered mercenary units were draining me faster than a child does milkshakes, and with no unit in a good state, Cassander would have to return only with his retinue back in Anatolia. Disbanding these units were one of my hardest decisions in my total war history, the brave men who fought against insuperable odds and mastered over mounts, walls and armies had to be now send home. I always imagined how Cassander would have felt, if this was a real scene, how would he feel, boarding that ship while looking back on the shores of Thessaly, looking at the remnants of that battered and yet glorious army. 


**The return of a prince and the collapsing empire**: Well, so far I was speaking of Cassander, and his little trip around the Balkans. Well, things couldn't look bleaker, Antiochus I died a single turn after Cassander stepped his foot back on Seleucid land, this brought Antiochus II on the throne, a drunkard, womanizer, and a green coward. At the same time, my enemies, just wouldn't give me a break, the Parthians conquered Charax and now threatened the imperial capital itself, the Macedonians marched from Lesbos and besieged Pergamon, and while I was able to wrestle control of Kilikia for the 3rd time from my hated enemies the Ptolemee, they had just landed on Sidon and were getting dangerously close to Damascus, I got to admit… I've looked better! So, I did what every sensible Warlord would have done, I send Antiochus II on his own against the Parthian hordes, and I got rid of that disgraceful drunkard that dared call himself ""diadochos"" of Alexander the Great.


**The king is dead, long live the king**: And thus came Cassander I, 21 to become Basileus of Asia, I could write so much about his 42 year reign, he went on to campaign for the next 10 years, against all the fronts. The Macedonians were quickly defeated and lost their foothold on Anatolia, to ensure no further problems would arise, Cassander quickly subjugated the entirety of Pontus for good measure, it wasn't personal just strictly business. Next in line were the Ptoleme's, the war swift but bitter and bloody, although the war didn't conclude with a sole victor, Cassander became ruler of all Anatolia, but the Pharaoh's kept Sidon. While all this was happening, trusted generals and cousins, mounted the greatest campaign towards the east since the days of Alexander, three army groups, ranging from the north around Caspian, to the south with the Persian Gulf, begun a long war against the Parthians, that ultimately, when the ceasefire with Egypt was achieved allowed Cassender to join and 20 years after his coronation lead, to a complete defeat of the Pahlavas and bringing Bactria to the state of vassalage where they rightfully belonged.


**The Romans!**: While Cassander was reinstating what was rightfully his; a greater threat was rising in the west, a young Republic centered in Latio, begun growing and growing fast, although they had wrestled control of Magna Grecia, from the Epirotes almost 50 years ago, they seemed to be occupied in the west, against Celts and the Carthaginians, it wasn't until the 16th year of Cassander's reign, when the first legions appeared in Illyria, Segestica and Dalminion had only a handful of defenders and thus they fell within the year. That would be the beginning of a war that would last till the end of the game. The Romans, of course didn't stop there, year after year, they kept on pushing into Hellas, first to bite the dust were the Epirotes; Cassander tried to form a Pan-Hellenic alliance among the diadochoi, but to no avail, the stubbornness and envy of the his fellow Greeks proved a worse enemy than the Roman Republic itself. Soon the entire Greek peninsula was under Roman occupation, and there was little Cassander could do, other than hastily conquer, Rhodos, Krete and Chalkis.


**King of Kings**: While Greece seemed lost for the time, that didn't mean that peace would rest upon the land, Cassander moved the capital from Seleukeia to Antiocheia, both as to symbolize the shift the empire had taken towards the west, but also in support for the undertaking of building the biggest and strongest fleet to master the seas. At the same time Seleucos and Demetrios, Cassander's firstborn and son in law respectively, took the reins of the offensive against the Ptolemee and following a bloody war, the hated Pharaoh's of Egypt accepted Cassander as king and overlord, sole heir to Alexander; Cassander was now the King of Kings.


**The final gamble**: Cassander was 64 when the order to liberate Hellas was given, the Basileus himself would take part in the war (at this point Cassander hadn't fought a battle for well over 15 years), all the fleets encroached around the peninsula, some of them set sail all the way to Sicily to block or stall Roman reinforcements, ten full armies were mastered, Seleucos would land of Chalkis (fallen 3 years before), while Demetrios would land on Athens, the armies of Attalos, Perchion, Alexander, Antiochus and others (sons, and close relatives of Cassander) would attack in succession over land, towards Macedonia proper, and over sea to support Demetrios and Seleucos, Cassander himself would arrive once a foothold was created with a force of the most elite veterans, elephants and siege machines. It all seemed so perfect; it seemed to me that nothing could go wrong...


**From a small misstep to a catastrophe**: While I thought that I would find Greece undefended I was wrong, terribly wrong; the Romans grew to become a super power, with their western borders secured and with the Phoenicians all but destroyed, Greece was choke filled with roman legions, perhaps as many as the Seleucid forces, to add to the insult the Romans had build a great navy of their own, and initial strategy of blockade was hastily abandoned as to secure the ferrying of troops into Greece. And then came the first big slap, Chalkis fell in a whim but after a bloody siege of Athens, where many a' Greeks and Romans were slaughtered Demetrius was facing an incoming siege, without Seleucos reinforcements who were fighting their way south to Athens.
It seemed that for every city I would conquer, for every battle I would win, the toll in Greek lives was so high that, further operations of those armies were impossible. And then, catastrophe stuck; first Cassander's queen, Andromache wife of 38 years and mother of 4 children perished with Cassander thousands of miles away, but it didn't end there, during the winter of 175 B.C. Seleucos fell into a Roman trap while entering Attike and there, below mount Parnasus brave Seleucos fell while leading his army to victory. Cassander now had lost thousands of men, a son, his wife, a’ many relatives and friends. Had he wronged the gods? What hubris did he commit to receive such nemesis? Why did beloved Athena abandon him, during this noble undertaking?

**Edit 1**. Bloody hell, this is full of grammatical errors, i even botched the title, sorry for the numerous mistakes chaps. And a big thanks to all of you that have liked the story!

 * **Rise of the Republic**

The traditional style of warfare in iron age Italy was pretty simple, fighting with a large wooden shield and spear or javelins, in a manner /u/Celebreth described as ""similar to cattle rustling"" due to its emphasis on raids and counter-raids. The Etruscans [adopted the Greek style of hoplite warfare](http://i.imgur.com/By5fm.jpg). This spread to the kingdom of Rome under Etruscan kings, as Rome cemented into a city-state. However, the Romans did still mix in some traditional styles too. The early Roman republic had obligatory militia service, much like in Greece, and each praetor commanded one of Rome's two legions. Roman soldiers at the time included 6000 [Greek-style hoplites](http://i.imgur.com/gdla6.jpg), some Rorarii (presumably reserves but their panoply is uncertain), 2400 Accensi (skirmishers), and 600 light cavalry. Republican Rome had an alliance with other Latin to defend against raids by central Italian hill tribes. This alliance clashed with the Aequi and Volsci tribes as well as the Sabines and Etruscans. Rome turned around and beat down its own allies that tried to withdraw from the alliance, which shows who was boss at the time. Rome was generally pretty successful at this time, only suffering a major defeat to some Gauls who were luckily just looking for loot and didn't stick around.

 * **Manipular Legion**

During the mid-republic, Rome replaced its large, boxy phalanxes with articulated units (meaning they were subdivided into smaller units to allow greater flexibility) in a more [""checkerboard""](http://hannibalbarca.webspace.virginmedia.com/Graphics/manipular-Legion.gif) formation. There's a good chance that this style of organization was copied from the [Samnites](http://i.imgur.com/T8DEA.jpg) Rome competed with. The equipment of [Rome's soldiers](http://i.imgur.com/ANcyO.jpg) changed to meet the needs of the maniples. The hastati and principes (translated as ""spearmen"" and ""first"" respectively) fought in [typical Italian style](http://i.imgur.com/7vkw2.jpg) with swords, large shields, and javelins, with swords being unusually important. These were young-to-middle-aged men making up the first two lines of a cohort. The triarii, or third-rankers, continued to use the older hoplite style, and were made up of veteran old men. These were the guys who *knew* fighting, but weren't as fit as the other soldiers, so they served as a reserve to save the day when shit got real. [Velites](http://i.imgur.com/EUQRR.jpg) were very poor or young citizens serving as skirmishers to screen and otherwise support the army. Roman soldiers at the time were citizens expected to serve sixteen (non-consecutive) years. They were semi-professional, but could still be described as levies, serving in impermanent armies raised as needed.

The Manipular legion's cavalry was made up of Rome's super rich, using a sword, shield, helmet, body armor, and javelins. They were not very good at the traditional cavalry duties of scouting and screening, since they were drawn from the rich, but were decent shock cavalry. Regardless, there were only about 300 cavalrymen per legion, split into ten troops of 30 men, so they could hardly be decisive. The socii were Rome's allies. The old multilateral alliances with other Latin city-states were replaced by a number of bilateral alliances with tributary states, so these troops were auxiliaries rather than partners.

During this time period, Rome adopted chainmail armor from Celtic peoples, and the scutum (a large, convex, oval, wooden shield) came to replace the hoplon shield for triarii, making it the standard Roman shield. Additionally, Rome started using the pilum, a heavy javelin with a deforming shank, and the gladius, a short, stabbing sword, from [Celtiberian mercenaries](http://i.imgur.com/mhave.jpg) serving Carthage, a rival Republic in northern Africa. The pilum replaced both spears and javelins for the first two ranks of the cohort, but the triarii continued to use spears. After fighting two major wars with Carthage and expanding into the Mediterranean, Rome started hiring foreign mercenaries to help fill certain tactical gaps. Numidians from northern Africa provided [light cavalry](http://i.imgur.com/P9SAW.jpg) while slingers from the Balaeric islands and archers from Crete gave Rome a little firepower.

 * **Marius's Mules**

The old citizens' levy didn't work for occupying overseas provinces because these citizen-soldiers had farms to attend to, and couldn't spend too much time on long ""tours of duty"". Property requirements were waved to allow the proletarii (landless Romans) to join as volunteers for extended service. This gave Rome manpower for extended overseas occupations. The old maniples with three ranks were replaced by cohorts that were the all (mostly) the same. This is probably because the incoming proletarii completely changed the demographics of the army which the maniples relied on. Marius is credited with many of these changes, but in reality he just recognized and utilized changes that had already been going on for the past century. [""Marian"" legionaries](http://i.imgur.com/7kF32.jpg) were quipped more or less the same as the hastati and principes that preceded them, although chainmail gradually became more common and helmet types eventually changed due to increased contact with Gauls. Still many legionaries went into battle unarmored, at least until they got enough loot to buy some decent mail.

After Rome's Italian allies revolted in the Social War (91–88 BC) they were made citizens of Rome. The old allied cohorts were disbanded, their citizens now fighting as regular legionaries. This drove Rome to look elsewhere for cavalry and other support troops. Numerous different allied tributaries provided the Romans with auxiliaries or mercenaries. In addition to the previously mentioned mercenaries, Celtiberian, Thracian, and Numidian warriors made for excellent skirmishers. Greek [thureophoroi](http://i.imgur.com/fSsw7.jpg) and thorakites were similar enough to legionaries to fight alongside them. Germans and [Gauls](http://i.imgur.com/qfT4D.jpg) provided Caesar with some decent shock cavalry, and Greek cavalry did the same for generals fighting further east. Archers from the middle east added to the army's firepower.

 * **Pax Romana**

After the clusterfuck of civil wars between Caesar, Pompey, and Caesar's successors, Octavian came out victorious. As Augustus he established the *principate*, better known as the Roman Empire. The system largely preserved republican traditions, but Augustus was the *princeps* (First Citizen) holding most of the republic's key titles and controlling it all as an autocrat. He reorganized many aspects of the Roman empire, including the military, although in many cases this simply made changes from the civil wars official. The first cohort of each legion was enlarged to 5 double-sized centuries by now. Some legionaries acted as mounted scouts and messengers. This time period also saw the addition of ""field artillery"" ballistas and scorpios. Overall now there were a total 30 legions and an equal number of auxilaries. This system was generally very flexible, and legions usually left a cohort or two as garrisons when campaigning.

The legions still recruited exclusively from Roman citizens, but by AD 100 most of these were from outside Italy. Armor was still mostly lorica hamata, which never disappeared even after the introduction of lorcia segmenta around AD 30-40. The legions acquired better helmets, mostly developed from Gallic designs, and were still fighting with two pila and a gladius. The scutum became more rectangular and eventually gained straight sides. By now the legionaries' equipment had become very heavy where before it was pretty light, so when going on patrol or raids or whatever they'd carry a lighter kit, only putting on armor for pitched battles, and sometimes not even then. Overall, Roman legionaries [changed](http://i.imgur.com/Nszav.jpg) [significantly](http://i.imgur.com/Ay3yT.jpg) in the early decades of the empire.

Praetorian guards had been bodyguards of prominent Roman generals from the republican period. They were expanded to a battlefield role during civil wars, acting as elite troops. Augustus saw the political uses of praetorians, and created a small force of troops used as bodyguards, palace guards, and police or defenders for Rome itself. They were more political than military, and frequently involved in political games. They sometimes assassinated or proclaimed their own emperors, but were still a capable battlefield force when the emperor was on campaign, and soldiers the emperor had on hand at any time.

The system established by Augustus remained in place with little change for the duration of the principate.

I also got a few requests. The two most requested subjects I cover have been Carthage and the samurai. Well guess what? I don't know much at all about Carthage so you're getting Japan. It fits more with my personal interest in the history of soldiers' places in society, anyway.

I'm working with mediocre sources here because my subscription to JSTOR expired and I owe the library a bunch of money. Anyone who can correct me, please do.

**Origins of the Samurai**

Japan's [earliest](http://i.imgur.com/5lEKbNA.jpg) [armies](http://i.imgur.com/uiCaIul.jpg) were similar to the armies of nearly every other ancient civilization. They included noblemen with the best arms and armor at their head, as well as a larger body of levy troops, usually armed with pole weapons or bows. At one point the emperor attempted to implement a Chinese-style national army based on conscription. This reform failed in the face of widespread desertion.

The emperor had to rely on the land-owning class to provide [fighting men.](http://i.imgur.com/3fKE1d4.jpg) They already had their own horses, and were already leaders in society as well as the elite on any battlefield. Unlike conscripts, they were also reliable. They had something to lose, and their interests were with the empire.

These clan warriors were typically mounted archers. They used long bows, drawn from only one third up the length of the bow, so they could wield the long weapon from horseback. They also carried long, straight swords as a secondary weapon, and were generally well armored. Their primary enemies, the Emishi, also fought as mounted archers.

**Predecessors of the Ashigaru**

[*Genin*](http://i.imgur.com/mtVatbF.jpg) were a warrior's attendants. They carried their master's gear, tended to his horses, and collected severed heads on the battlefield. These are the basis for the attendant units in Rise of the Samurai, but in reality they were actual attendants rather than distinct fighting formations. Loyal attendants were sometimes promoted to the ranks of the warrior elite, and could be compared to European squires in function, although they were non-noble and therefore their ascension was far from guaranteed.

Ancient and medieval Japanese warfare mostly consisted of a series or private duels between noble warriors, with attendents only acting in a supporting role. However, attendants may engage in fighting to protect their master, particularly against lower-class attackers who were not worth his attention.

Additionally, noble warriors received support from the peasants who worked their lands and acted as [levied foot soldiers.](http://i.imgur.com/ZUVfvpy.jpg) These are easily comparable to the lowly foot soldiers of medieval European warfare. The ""levy"" units in Rise of the Samurai are a great representation of them. They were responsible for all the dirty work in warfare. They set up barricades, foraged for food, and set fire to enemy villages. There is very little textual evidence for their existence, but they appear frequently in contemporary art.

**Rise of the Samurai**

In the 8th and 9th centuries, [provincial clans](http://i.imgur.com/2mtDeMj.jpg) gained more and more military power while using it to consolidate political power. The Fujiwara family controlled the imperial court, so other noble families sought other paths to power. The Taira and Minamoto families were both provincial warrior clans. The difference in military style between them was not as pronounced as implied by the Rise of the Samurai campaign, although the Taira were more cautious in their use of political power to implement social change.

Once the Taira ousted the Minamoto, warrior clans dominated imperial politics. The political power of these clans grew as they retained governing posts (rather than serving brief terms as governor), passed down their official positions to their heirs, and formed alliances with one and other. The warrior clans solidified into a distinct class: [the samurai.](http://i.imgur.com/fNsfFyx.jpg) After the Genpei War, which saw the Taira fall from power, the Minamoto established an official military government run by the [warrior class.](http://i.imgur.com/vZmMjd7.jpg)

Samurai clans fought each other throughout the later Kamakira and Ashikaga shogunates for land and for power. This developed into endemic warfare in Japan, but like endemic warfare in other times and places, it was somewhat ritualized and regulated by tradition. Samurai fought samurai in honorable battlefield duels, still acting primarily as [mounted archers.](http://i.imgur.com/xsxmIqp.jpg) The samurai valued swordsmanship, but swords were still just sidearms for use in desperate situations, or as tools for claiming a fallen enemy's head. By this time Japanese swords acquired their distinct curve.

**Rise of the Ashigaru**

The wars of the Nanbokucho period (14th century) saw a change in samurai warfare. Rather than dueling in open fields, they increasingly used defended areas in the mountains of central Japan. This led to the use of volley shooting from [dismounted archers,](http://i.imgur.com/va9FUaj.jpg) possibly a tactic adopted from the Mongols during the invasions of the 13th century. Some of the dismounted archers were not actually samurai but lower-class warriors called *shashu no ashigaru* (light foot shooters). They were probably simply levies used to put more arrows in the air.

The Onin War (1467-77) was unique, since most of its fighting took place in and around Kyoto, a rich area where looting offered quick and easy access to wealth for peasants. Warrior clans got [peasant levies](http://i.imgur.com/c5nJ79k.jpg) to follow them for the promise of looting opportunities. These peasants were called ashigaru, and mostly acted as disorganized mobs who's only weapons were simple spears (such as sharpened bamboo) and farm implements until they looted better arms and armor.

These early ashigaru were invaluable to warrior clans because they added significant manpower at little to no extra cost, but they were totally unreliable. As soon as they'd done their share of looting they would desert, and were just as likely to follow a rival if they thought they had better opportunities on his side. Ambitious and innovative samurai lords began training the ashigaru for war, equipping them with *okashi gusaku* (loan armor), feeding them, and otherwise incorporating them into his army as [semiprofessional troops.](http://i.imgur.com/qu48b16.jpg)

The line between ashigaru and samurai was a very blurry one. Many of them began their careers as ji-samurai, poor samurai who were part-time farmers to support themselves. Peasant ashigaru who made a name for themselves as loyal and competent warriors could receive honors and positions that made them samurai in all but name.

**Sengoku Jidai**

The Warring States period saw a number of tactical changes in weapons and roles for both samurai and ashigaru. Older ashigaru *yari* (spears) were replaced with long-shafted yari, similar to contemporary pikes, as the [ashigaru](http://i.imgur.com/KUhBRR9.jpg) professionalized enough to handle such weapons in formation. The ashigaru also used more missile weapons, first [bows](http://i.imgur.com/hvYcGtC.jpg) and then new [matchlock arquebuses](http://i.imgur.com/CiTPGa3.jpg) introduced in the mid-16th century. Matchlocks required less training than bows, packed much more of a punch, and had greater range, but bows provided a much greater rate of fire, so both were used together.

As the ashigaru professionalized and took on more battlefield roles, the samurai specialized. Mounted samurai adopted shock cavalry tactics, acting as [heavy lancers](http://i.imgur.com/KfgpdBa.jpg) instead of mounted archers. [Dismounted samurai](http://i.imgur.com/Qs30RV6.jpg) also used heavier armor and increasingly traded their bows for spears, fighting in formation rather than as individuals. By the mid-16th century, samurai armies regularly used ashigaru as archers, and samurai mostly acted as shocktroops armed with yari, in an interesting reversal of roles. The samurai acted as officers for ashigaru units as well as fighting in their own elite units.

In battle, ashigaru archers and matchlockmen were tasked with whittling down the enemy force, before the samurai led a devastating charge. Some samurai criticized this seemingly inglorious ""ashigaru warfare."" At the [Battle of Nagashino,](http://i.imgur.com/7fHgBab.jpg) Oda Nobunaga's ashigaru stopped Takeda samurai in a cavalry charge with disciplined volley fire from their matchlocks under firm samurai leadership. This served as a clear demonstration of the power of ashigaru warfare.

In addition to acting as regular soldiers, some ashigaru took on roles as personal attendants to elite samurai (just like earlier *genin* attendants). Ashigaru also acted as flag bearers and made up signals detachments for communication across the army. In short, the ashigaru took care of all the necessary roles in an early modern professional army.

**Toyotomi's Rule**

Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the son of an ashigaru, rose through the ranks to become Oda Nobunaga's personal attendant, and eventually received his own command, becoming a de facto samurai. After Nobunaga's death, his skill as a commander saw him become the most powerful man in Japan. He completed what Nobunaga had begun: the unification of Japan.

Once in power, he prevented any others from following his example of rising through the ranks. First he ordered the Sword Hunt, and his government confiscated all weaponry in the hands of the peasantry. A few years later he issued and edict solidifying class distinctions. He strictly defined the peasant, merchant, and samurai classes, and forbid any social mobility between classes, up or down. He also denied samurai the right to seek a new master after leaving the employment of their lord.

With the implementation of these laws, peasant levies could never again serve as soldiers, only laborers building fortifications and fieldwork or tending to logistics. Under this system, the ashigaru also technically became the lowest rank of the samurai class. For those wondering why Fall of the Samurai did not distinguish between ashigaru or samurai kachi, it's because by then ashigaru *were* samurai.

**Tokugawa Shogunate**

During the Tokugawa shogunate that followed Hideyoshi's reign the samurai class completely transformed. With no wars to fight, the samurai looked to other pursuits. Some lived off stipends from their lords and became idle courtiers. Others found employment as bureaucrats, administrators, and police. Only a few maintained their martial traditions, oftentimes as duelists.

Weapons such as the yari, naginata, bow, and matchlock fell out of use with no battles to fight. However, only the samurai were allowed to carry swords, making them a status symbol. For many samurai, the sword was simply a fashion accessory, and style reigned over function. Samurai of this time period spent ridiculous sums of money on their swords, and justified their purchases by inflating the swords' qualities. No, katana can not actually cut through steel armor.

The idle samurai also romanticized their past. This is the period when bushido became so important and took the form most recognizable today. The social expectations for a samurai also expanded in the Edo period, since they had so much time and so little to kill. The art of flower arranging became important to many samurai, who compared it to arranging troops on a battlefield.

These guys were obviously bored out of their minds and in need of something to get killed over.

First post for a while and I want to take this opportunity to talk about the changes we have made to the combat system and tweaks we have made to the morale system as well.

**Combat changes**
-
There have been big changes to the combat system for Rome II. I will talk about these changes in the context of some new stats: weapon damage and health.

Weapon damage is split into two parts, base damage and armour piercing damage (referred to as AP damage from here on out). AP damage is always applied but base damage can be blocked by armour. Melee weapons and projectiles have this damage split. Health is the amount of hit points a soldier in a unit has, and damage dealt reduces a soldiers hit points.

This system gives us a lot more flexibility in how we balance units. Whereas before an axe may have been set as armour piercing which would reduce target armour by half, the new system allows us to give axes lots of AP damage but little base damage so that most of their damage cannot be blocked by armour. Other weapons may have the other extreme, lots of base damage but low AP damage which would make them fantastic against units with low armour but weak against more heavily armoured opponents.

All weapons do some AP damage so you can always guarantee that no matter who is fighting who some damage will always be done, though this may be very little.

Health has been introduced as the system that damage affects, most units will have a similar amount of health (more for cavalry when mounted to show the hit points of horses) and armour will be a bigger factor in a unit’s survivability as that can block damage whereas health can only absorb so much.

Melee defence is still a factor and is matched against melee attack to determine if a unit will hit and then see if it does damage.

Shields in Rome II do not just provide a bonus to melee defence, they now can provide a bonus to both melee defence and armour when a soldier is attacked from the front or left. How much of a bonus is given to melee defence or armour is dependent on the shield a unit has in the database. So a hoplite shield will give a big bonus to armour but less to melee defence due to how it was held close to the body and could not be moved around lots, but a celtic shield will give a big bonus to melee defence showing how it was used much more actively.

Charge bonus now affects both melee attack and damage to reflect the changes made to the combat system.

All these changes allow for a lot more flexibility and more depth to be portrayed in the unit balancing and combat calculations. This system has more depth to it than any previous Total War games whilst keeping the rules simple so players can grasp what each stat means. All the complexity of the previous system has been retained with more added to it

A brief note here on ranged combat. With the way we display arcs to show the range of missile units, dynamic height based range bonuses are basically impossible to do as it is entirely dependent on who the unit is targeting. Instead we have implemented a damage bonus for ranged units firing down on enemies, and a damage reduction for ranged units firing up on enemies. This allows us to have an advantage for ranged units on high ground without massively complicated code for dynamic firing arcs with very few benefits.

The new combat rules also have one v many combat coded into them. The animations may look 1v1, but under the hood every available additional attacker is factored in and will result in a person surrounded by enemies dying a lot faster.

**Morale Changes**
-
There have been less code changes to the morale system, the big one being a smoothing mechanism to soften some of the big jumps between different morale values that can be caused by balancing. This, when combined with units being in the wavering state for longer will allow players more time to react to units in trouble and to try and boost their morale.

The morale values themselves have had a lot of changes, for example the morale penalty from being under missile fire is much greater in Rome II to emphasise the harassment nature of missile units and allow those ranged units to be less focused on just killing opponents and so offer a wider array of tactical uses. The morale effects for lost casualties and flanking have also ben tweaked to help make the cause and effect of player actions more clear in the battlefield and put more emphasis on good movement and positioning.

**Unit Stat Scales**
-
As some people noticed in the Teutoberg trailer, the stats for units are a lot bigger now. This is because we are using a wider range of stats for units in Rome II. For example in Shogun 2 morale may have gone from 4 to 15 for most units (excluding heroes). In Rome II it can go from 10 to 75.

This greater range allows us much more granularity in the bonuses we give from experience and in the campaign and also a greater range to differentiate units over.

Additionally, I should point out that the Teutoberg video certainly showed barbarian units breaking earlier and Roman units surviving longer than they will do in the final game. We tweaked this for the video so that the guy demoing it could actually get through the battle to the end without dying horribly halfway through. It can be hilarious when that happens for the fifth time in a row, but maybe not so much when we are trying to record a video to show you….

Below are images of some of the Greek shield patterns.

100% of the credit goes to motormouth85 ,Mmurray821 ,Drtad,I Don't Work Here and the others that were attending. Since I didn't see it here, and I'm sure there are people that visit /r/totalwar that don't visit twcenter or totalwar.com I thought I would repost the answers here.Repeat, I was not there.I am just consolidating information from a couple of websites.  **Remember all of the info is word of mouth, and subject to change. ** 

I'll keep this updated the next couple of days as more info comes available. Just, when you check back go straight to the bottom under ""Edits"". 

**Campaign Map**


* 183 territories ,117 factions, 500 different unit types as well as 30 different ""city types"" and 70 different buildings (Rough Number)

* The Eastern edge of the map MAY extend farther than Bactria. Perhaps I misunderstood but they said that the Eastern edge of the map has not been revealed yet.

* Armies on the campaign map can be set to certain stances. For example, an army set to forced march will be able to go further, but the various drawbacks include a vulnerability to ambush. Other stances include the ambush stance, and there was another that I can't recall.

* Internal conflict and civil war will act as a check to balance gameplay should the player's empire become a rich military juggernaut.

* I asked about sea-regions. They explained that yes, the sea will be divided into several regions, and that a navy in a particular region will have dominance over that region. However, it was mentioned that a zone of control effect would still be in play in some ways, such as raiding trade routes. Like armies, navies can be placed in certain stances (raid, patrol/defend, etc). I think this will make more sense as we get more previews and some campaign map footage.

* The four seasons will be in the game, even though it is one turn per year. How exactly this will be implemented is still up for debate. Battlefields will 100% have different seasons. I think this will be elaborated on later.

* CA is trying to lure players into pitched battles on open terrain - they feel siege battles should not be the focus of combat.

* Characters have more movement points than armies. One example I talked with Mike Simpson about is Scipio Africanus where he gave up command of an army in Spain and was in Sicily in a few months training a new army for the African invasion. In game terms he boarded a ship and sailed to Sicily in the one turn/year.

* Armies can move over rivers without building boats/bridges

* Someone asked about city-view, and they said that if there was enough demand they would put it in. Mike Simpson mentioned that he personally wouldn't use such a mode, but if enough of the player base wanted it then it was doable.

* You will be able to see your cities grow more progressively on the campaign map. As you build individual buildings, you will be able to see them appear on the campaign map. 


* ~~(I hate to say this as it will cause much vexation) Attrition is out. I got this from Mike Simpson himself~~ According to CA_Thamis : This must have been a misunderstanding at the event. Rest assured, we most certainly have attrition in the game.


**Battle Map**

* NO destructible environments (one of the questions was about starting forest fires during combat; CA was worried it would create too much havoc and detract from the combat)

* The Line of Sight element was expanded upon - if your soldiers cannot see the enemy, neither can you

* Viewing settlements on the Battle Map could be incorporated IF there is high demand for the feature. Some of us made a pretty good case for the feature as a way to devise a defense of a city, without actually being under siege, as well as get the satisfaction of watching the city grow and develop.

* Enemy AI will be more intuitive; i.e., attempting to outflank you during pitched battles, or flooding a wall breach during a siege.

* Terrain covered with dead bodies will become bloodstained, but it is very mild. Craig from CA told me that a blood DLC is likely.

* Routing unit flags not in the battle, may be added later (the unit flag turning to white) The unit flag just goes away and the men run.

* Seasons will show up in battles. How exactly this works is still being developed


* Battle maps will look just as good as the stuff you have seen so far. In fact, there is a tile for the area the Teutoburg Forest and if you start a battle in that area, you will get the same map as the historical battle is fought on.

* They reiterated the previous info about line-of-sight and scouting. Craig made a point to say that heavy infantry are bad for scouting, not that he was speaking from experience or anything. 



**Units**

* (**NEW**) Characters will have traits and skills, and will gain experience more quickly.They can get a lot done in a campaign, so don’t get too hung up on the raw numbers. 40 years was also given as an example of how long generals and agents can live for. Some may die gloriously in battle at the age of 20, others may last into their 80’s. There will be plenty of time to make use of your greatest characters.

* Cavalry smashes through enemy formations now.

* Barbarian berserkers are back, and they are human steamrollers

* Infantry units use their shields defensively when under archer attack

* Switching in and out of testudo is very fluid and quick

* Roman soldiers can throw their pilum while running

* Flaming Pigs are coming back!

* Arrows bounce off armor and shields. Was pretty cool to watch when zoomed in. Some stuck and others bounced off.


**Multiplayer**

* Multiplayer will be getting some TLC from the developers; expect more news on that soon



**Navy**

* You can put your navies in different modes like the armies, like raiding.

* Naval warfare will incorporate ramming and boarding actions. The Corvus was hinted at.



**General Info**

* (**NEW**)The game length is in line with previous Total War games Shogun 2 gave the player 240 turns to complete its victory conditions when playing a long campaign. Napoleon 244, Empire 200, Medieval II 230 or so. Rome II is balanced around a campaign length of approximately 300 turns, so is in fact longer than recent Total War games. 

* PC specs are being developed toward the high end and refined for the low end. Example: People with high end machines will see the technology being pushed pretty close to what can be done. But, people with low end machines AND INCLUDING INTEGRATED GRAPHIC CHIPS will be able to run the game with graphic settings that look good. Mike was very specific about this that they worked with Intel and other chip makers to bring the low end, generic machines to be able to run RTW2 with as great as graphics as possible.

* The end game depends on how you have decided to play throughout the campaign. If you are wary and appease contending families/nobility/etc within your faction, your end game will be different than if you choose to defy all of them. For Rome, you could choose to either defend the Republic and the Senate, or challenge the other families and the Senate yourself. It was also noted that other factions would have similar, yet unique iterations of this idea.

* It seems as though there will be a blood pack similar to Shogun 2, due to the ratings issues, but I don't believe anything was confirmed yet.

* I asked about Armenia and Pontus as possible dlc candidates, and mentioned that ""The Poison King"" DLC pack would be a catchy title. Unfortunately there is not answer to this just yet. I also asked if Armenian legionnaires would be making a reappearance, but this was not confirmed either.

* The CPU/GPU usage will be more efficient to a degree on the low end, but on the high end things will be pretty similar to Shogun 2 in terms of CPU/GPU usage. I'm not that much of a technically minded guy so perhaps someone else can explain that better than I can.

Like a brave general will receive command bonuses for great and heroic victories, why shouldn't the foot soldiers of my army not receive the same?

Now I know they get experience etc, but if they are always operating siege equipment then surly they should become quite accustomed to it and maybe become faster at using it, more efficient so to speak... Its just something to ponder as we all wait in anguish for Rome II and if this is an addition to the game then I for one will be that little bit happier. But what is your opinion of this r/totalwar? Maybe this could branch out into cavalry having a stronger charge or onagers finding there accuracy quicker then usual!

So, like me you're probably super excited for Rome 2’s release which is right around the corner! In preparation for the big event I thought I would put together this super-awesome-mega-thread with tons of material to satisfy your hype craving. Most of it has been collected from this subreddit as well as other Total War websites. While some of the material might not be 100% historically accurate, the main focus of the thread is to ride the choo-choo train to hype town. So without further adieu... *All aboard!*

**The Legionaries**


When giving an overview of any army throughout history, the first facet to be detailed should be that of the soldiers themselves.

All members of the Roman legion, aside from the allied divisions of which we will discuss later, were actual Roman citizens at this point in time. The property qualification which would be abandoned during the fall of the Republic still proudly stood, and Romans still proudly fought their enemies on the field. Thusly, all legionaries held land in and around Rome, most likely a farm, and after service would be discharged and would return to their farm with honorable distinction. 

There were generally five ""classes"" of soldier a legionary would become upon entering the legion, and these depended upon the citizen's wealth, which could be used to afford better equipment as the state did not provide yours, and veterancy. The poorest and freshest recruits would become *velites*, which were light infantry skirmishers most likely fronting the legion in battle formation. The *velites* were armed with a bundle of light javelins which were used to soften the enemy ranks before entering melee. For melee, *velites* were armed with the same short sword the rest of the legion was equipped with, the famous *gladius hispaniensis* (usually referred to as the *gladius*, even though *gladius* only means shortsword in Latin and does not refer to as any specific sword). *Gladii*, originally forged by the Celtiberians of Iberia, would become a staple of the Roman legion sometime before the Punic Wars. Designed for stabbing rather than cutting and slashing, a stab wound inflicted by a *gladius* would often be fatal. For defense, *velites* were equipped with circular shields three feet in diameter, but would wear no formal armor. Finally, a skirmisher of the *velites* would be given a wolfskin headdress, most likely to make them easier to immediately identify by a Roman officer.

The second class of soldier a legionary could expect to become would be the *hastati*, the first row of the *triplex acies*, of which we will discuss in depth in the Roman Legion in Battle Formation segment. The *hastati* were the first line of heavy infantry in the legion, and were always young and mostly poor, but not quite so young and poor as the *velites*. The *hastati* were also armed with a *gladius*, but instead of having the bundle of light javelins the skirmishers had, the *hastati* would be armed with a couple of *pila*, the famous Roman heavy javelin. The *pila* were about four feet long, with one of a *hastatus'* (excuse my Latin, I'm not good with anything except for the actual name of things) set being longer than the other. The *pilum* was designed to be thrown with all the force of a legionary behind it to strike the enemy's shield and either lodge itself within the shield, rendering the shield useless, or break through and wound the enemy himself. Some sources also report that the pila were designed to break if they did not lodge themselves, as to make them unusable by the enemy. Defensively, the *hastatus* was equipped the same as the other two rows of the *triplex acies*. The circular shield of the *velites* is thrown out in favor of the famous *scutum*; the semi-cylindrical shield, four feet long and two feet wide. The shield would be held so to cover the legionary from above his knees to his neck. The shields could, of course, lock together to form the famous *testudo* formation. For armor, *hastati* donned bronze helmets (according to Adrian Goldsworthy, these were almost always of the Montefortino and Etruco-Corinthian designs) and greeves, along with some form of body armor. The sort of body armor worn could vary depending upon wealth and personal preference. Common body armor was the expensive mail cuirass or the cheaper bronze plate fixed to one's chest.

The second and third rows of the *triplex acies* were the *principes* and *triarii* respectively. Both were armored the same as the *hastati*, generally having the more expensive mail armor more often than the *hastati* would, and the *principes* carried the same *gladii* and *pila* of the *hastati*. However, the *triarii* were armed with the old hoplite spear, the *hasta*, a remnant of the older Roman phalanx, adopted from their Italian neighbors. The *triarii*, the oldest and wealthiest of the *triplex acies*, carried spears similar to that of the Greek hoplite; no where near as long as the sarissa of the Macedonian phalanx but long enough to get the point across. The *hasta*, as their spear was called (which the *hastati* would be named after as it is they during the time of the Roman hoplite phalanx which utilized the *hasta*), was around six and a half feet long with a tip of iron.

The last division of the Roman element of the Roman legion were the all-important cavalry, or *equites*. Manned by the wealthiest of Rome, the *equites* were the true career-starters of the Roman legion. Political office in Rome at the time required candidates have served ten campaigns in a legion as an infantryman, or five as an *eques. Therefore many of the wealthy politicians-to-be chose to serve as an *eques*. *Equites* were equipped with a round shield, a bronze helmet, a mail cuirass similar to that of the heavy infantry's cuirass, and armed with a spear and sword, although probably not a *gladius*. Polybius does not go in depth on the equipment of the cavalryman, and thusly the details already given are all I have to give to you.

Now that we have an overview of the soldiers themselves, we can look at the leadership of the legion itself.


**The Leadership of the Legion**


The leadership of a legion was a complicated network, similar to a pyramid in some cases, of officers and elected politicians that one today could view as horribly inefficient, and at times the disagreements of the many officers did create disaster for the republic, but it's hard to ignore what the legions accomplished with the cobweb of leadership I'm about to detail.

The apex of the leadership pyramid for most legions in times of stress, such as during the First and Second Punic Wars, was the consul. Two consuls were elected each year in Rome, and they held *imperium*, which allowed them to raise and command legions. A consular legion would be led by one consul, but often enough, if the times really called for it, two consular legions could be put together to be led by both consuls of the year, one holding seniority in command over the other every other day.

Every legion was also commanded by six military tribunes, men of Senatorial status appointed by the Senate to lead a legion in battle. Pairs of two military tribunes would hold command on a rotating schedule, similar to how the seniority of the two consuls would rotate. In the absense of a consul, the military tribunes would be the commanding officer of any legion, but even with the presence of consuls, the military tribunes were still present.

The *ala* of allied soldiers, of which we will discuss in more depth later but for now can refer to as the allied soldiers from other cities which supported every Roman legion, were led by three Roman prefects (*praefecti sociorum*) which were appointed by the consuls.

Two centurions commanded each maniple of heavy infantry, of which we will dicuss in the Battle Formation segment, but for now understand that for each 120-160 legionaries, there were two centurions, one senior to the other, who led them in the midst of battle. The junior *centurion* led from the back of the maniple, keeping the legionaries in formation, whilst the senior led more by example and fought in the first two ranks of the maniple while leading the tactical maneuvers, discussed in The Legion in Battle Formation. Centurions were promoted by the consuls or military tribunes on the basis of their leadership ability or their bravery in battle, distinguishing themselves somehow.

The cavalry were led by the *decurion*, three *decuriones* to every *turma* of cavalry, or three officers for every thirty cavalrymen.


**The Legion in Battle Formation**


As a foreword, a consular legion consisted of actually *two* legions, while a non-consular legion would be only one legion. So for a consular legion, simply double all the numbers I am about to give to you.

This is where the aforementioned *triplex acies* comes into play, in the battle formation itself. Fronting the legion would most likely be the *velites* in something of a solid line, numbering in something like 1,200, although this could be increased or decreased on necessity. Behind them would be the *triplex acies* itself. The *triplex* were three lines or rows of the heavy infantry: the first being the *hastati*, the second the *principes*, and the third the *triarii*. It is wrong to think of the rows as being solid lines, like is depicted in many movies on the period, but rather in ten groups of 120-160 for the first two lines, and  ten groups of 60 for the triarii (as there were much less *triarii* then there were *hastati* or *principes*). These groups were called maniples and formed the basis of the manipular legion, or the Polybian legion (Polybius is the Greek historian of whom we find most of our details on this from) of which we have been discussing.

Now, picture this: the ten square maniples of the *hastati* would be arranged in the front row so that there was a massive gap in between each one, something like the space of a whole maniple. So the front row of ten maniples took the space of twenty including the gaps. Behind the *hastati* are the *principes* and they are arranged in a similar manner, *however* they are shifted one maniple over so their blocks of legionaries match up with the gaps of the *hastati* line, and their gaps match up with the maniples of the *hastati* line. The *triarii* were arranged so their gaps matched up with the legionaries of the *principes* and their legionaries matched up with the gaps of the *principes*. What you are now seeing is a three rowed checkerboard of legionaries, with the black tiles on the checkerboard being the troops and the white spaces being nothing but empty air. The reason for deliberately leaving spaces in the battle formation is the whole premises of the manipular legion: in theory a legion could maneuver so that a tired maniple in the front line could switch place with a fresh one in the line back by using the spaces as maneuvering room. The commander could manipulate the maniples to place them wherever he wanted whenever he wanted.

In practice, extremely complicated maneuvering was really only done by the most experienced and veteran armies headed by the best commanders and officer corps, but the simple manuevering of replacing tired troops with fresh ones was available to any disciplined and well led legion. The benefits of a legion built upon such principles of manipulation do not require my listing.

The cavalry were organized in ten *turmae* of thirty, equaling 300 in a standard legion, ten percent of the 3,000 heavy infantry of the standard legion. Again, each *turma* would be led by three *decuriones*. And supporting each legion would be an *ala* of allied troops (two *alae* for a consular legion, one for each legion which made up the consul's force), numbering something like 5,000 men. The allied troops, sent from Latin allies of Rome, would be equipped much like the Romans would be and would demonstrate the same tactics and battle formation as the Romans would. However, Polybius tells us little on the allied troops and it is unknown whether or not they exercised the *triplex acies*, although it is likely. In battle formation, the *alae* would flank each side of the Roman consular legion.

Thusly, the final consular legion would number something like 20,000 men: 5,000 from each of the two standard legions, and 5,000 from each of the two *alae* which flanked the legions in battle.


**Final Notes**


There you have it, a somewhat comprehensive overview of the Roman legion circa 264 B.C. - 146 B.C. All this information will become out-dated when Marius gives us his extremely important Marian reforms, which would be a herald of doom for the Roman Republic, but that is a topic for another day.


My ancient sources for this were simply Polybius, as he gives us the best review of the Roman legion at this time, hence the name (the Polybian legion). As for my more recent sources, I used Adrian Goldsworthy's *The Punic Wars*, and I highly recommend all of his work, not just on the Punic Wars, to any aspiring Roman military historian.


I've been receiving even more assistance by very helpful and knowledgeable members of /r/totalwar who have been dropping comments, which have both corrected my mistakes and added to the information already present. Credits go to /u/Blizzaldo for corrections on the spear used by a *triarius*, now known as the *hasta*, and information on the combat roles of the centurions (and now also correcting me on the amount of campaigns/service time required to run for political office as an *eques*). Credit also goes to /u/TheAmazingKoki for correcting my awful Latin and being quite generous with information on plural and singular versions of Latin nouns used throughout this overview. *Gratias* to the fine man. I would also like to thank /u/KingofAlba for pointing out my misuse of the word *gladius*, which should have been *gladius hispaniensis*. Finally, I'd like to thank the academy - I mean, /u/ProbablyNotLying for giving me the idea in the first place with all his wonderful posts on just about everything (check him out in the sidebar!).",,False,self,t5_2rq9c,1373175561.0,,rome2g,True,t3_1hr2cb,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1hr2cb/a_detailed_overivew_of_the_roman_legion_during/,

The history of Greek Egypt is dominated by a series of plots, betrayals, coups, rebellions, and assassinations comparable to Game of Thrones. Also, lots of incest and everyone is named either Ptolemy or Cleopatra.

I will focus on the different kinds of soldiers and their panoplies rather than large scale organization, because that's what matters for a Total War game and because I tend to focus on doctrine and systems of recruitment when studying military history. The Ptolemaic army was largely split into two parts: a standing army composed of long-service mercenaries and a reserve of land-owning soldiers called *kleruchoi*. I will split my description into three parts based on soldiers' cultural origins.

I want to sincerely apologize for the scarcity of illustrations in this post, as compared to my other posts. I have always been a very visual learner, and I like to include lots of images to reference. Unfortunately, there are just very few illustrations of Hellenistic soldiers in general.

**Greco-Macedonian Soldiers**

At the establishment of the Ptolemaic kingdom, the army consisted of Alexander the Great's veterans and other Macedonian garrison troops, plus mercenaries hired by Ptolemy I. This meant that, at least at first, the sarissa phalanx held a central position in the army. However, limited military reform began in the leadup to the Battle of Raphia (219-217) and by the reforms of the 160s the army had been completely transformed.

* The Elite

The standing army was composed of guards units and garrisons. These were mostly Greek or Macedonian, or even Hellenized people from other cultures. They protected the king and his court, and prevented rebellion within the empire. They also provided the elite core of the army while on campaign. Standing Greco-Macedonian units fought in [Macedonian-style](http://i.imgur.com/mGsPJIi.jpg) phalanxes with sarissa early in the empire's history, but tended to be better armored than the phalanxes which conquered Persia. Later, after the decline of the sarissa phalanx, elite units were more likely to fight as medium or heavy spearmen, sometimes armored in mail.

* The Reserves

Ptolemy and his successors encouraged settlement of Egypt in military colonies. Greeks, Macedonians, and Galatians received land in exchange for military service. Sekunda describes them as a ""territorial army"" and Fischer-Bovet recognizes them as the regular army (possibly comparable to Greek and Roman part-time citizen soldiers). The system worked well until land grants became hereditary in the late 3rd century, eliminating any incentive for soldiers' sons to join the army.

These kleruchoi (named for the *kleros* land grant) spent most of their time living as farmers, but were mobilized into pre-organized unites in times of war like reservists. The panoply of kleruchoi is uncertain, but we do know that kleruchoi received different sized land allotments based on what kind of unit they served in. It seems that there were peltastai, phalanx, and cavalry kleruchoi.

* Light Infantry

[Peltastai](http://i.imgur.com/fr7xuLd.gif) were very common in Alexander the Great's army, and were the ""standard"" mercenary of the Greek world in his lifetime. They were well armed with javelins for skirmishing and a spear for protection in close combat. Peltastai took their name from the *pelte*, a name for any lightweight, small shield. This served as their only protection unless they could afford a helmet.

Some peltastai replaced their pelte with larger wooden *thureos* shields after extensive contact between the Celts and Greeks from the 270s. These soldiers were called [*thureophoroi*.](http://i.imgur.com/flIjZOq.jpg) Later, in part because of Rome's influence, some began to adopt mail armor and earned the name [*thorakitai*.](http://i.imgur.com/mGuRSBh.jpg) Peltastai, thureophoroi, and thorakitai all [served alongside one and other,](http://i.imgur.com/O1LShbm.jpg) rather than new developments replacing older styles. ***Please note that Sekunda's references to ""Romanized"" soldiers in the images is incorrect.***

* Reform

Over time the Ptolemaic army changed to adapt to a changing situation. In the mid-2nd century BC, Egypt found itself less and less involved in foreign wars with other Hellenistic successor states, so pitched battles became less important. The Ptolemies turned more to lighter infantry such as peltastai, and reorganized their army for greater flexibility rather than large phalanxes, so thureophoroi and thorakitai became more common. By the mid-1st century BC, at the latest, the traditional Macedonian phalanx had disappeared from Egypt.

* Cavalry

Cavalry tactics and panoply in Egypt remained relatively unchanged since the days of Alexander the Great, despite reforms in organizational systems. For the most part, Greek cavalry included kleruchoi acting as [mounted skirmishers](http://i.imgur.com/NI8TeqH.jpg) armed with javelins and spears. More elite [""guard"" cavalry](http://i.imgur.com/pUZjG0w.jpg) was based on Alexander the Great's companions and similar mounted formations, although with more armor. These men fought as heavy shock cavalry, but not quite as well armored as the Seleukids' cataphracts.

**Native Egyptians**

Native Egyptians of high social standing were frequently Hellenized as they interacted with Greek rulers. Some Egyptians became kleruchoi later in the dynasty, and some Greeks are known to have served in ""machimoi"" units. The ethnicity of certain military men is ambiguous later in Ptolemaic history due to the practice of using both a Greek and an Egyptian name. Overall, the line between Greek Egyptians and native Egyptians gradually blurred.

* Origins

In Egypt's ""late period"" directly before Greco-Macedonian rule, [Egyptian warriors](http://i.imgur.com/1kIqi0G.jpg) seem to have mostly been soldier-farmers forming a militia army. Towns mobilized militia in times of crisis and provided them for campaigns. Some soldier-farmers also served part-time garrison duty. Egyptians also served Persia as [auxiliaries and marines](http://i.imgur.com/qB03OaA.jpg) during Persian occupation. Late period pharos also hired Greek hoplite mercenaries and rewarded them with land during the 26th dynasty (7th century). During later revolts, entire Greek forces intervened on behalf of the rebels. So even before Greek rule, Greek heavy infantry mercenaries served as the elite core of the Egyptian army while Egyptian warriors filled other roles.

* Auxiliaries

Early in the Ptolemaic dynasty, Egyptian soldiers only acted as garrison troops, police, and in other auxiliary roles rather than main military service. According to Europa Barbarorum, these *machimoi* were ""armed with several javelins, a sword, and a shield, and armored with a light cuirass and mass-produced helmet."" I do not know how historically accurate that panoply is. It's likely that Egyptian auxiliaries mostly acted as local variations of peltastai or thureophoroi. There is are also some mention of Egyptians using missile weapons, which could easily refer to javelins or bows.

* Regulars

In the leadup to the Battle of Raphia, Ptolemy IV allowed Egyptians to serve in the regular army due to a manpower shortage. The historical record indicates that these soldiers fought in Macedonian-style phalanxes. Their panoply is less certain later on, but probably follows the same pattern as their Greek counterparts. In the 2nd century BC, kleruchoi are known to include Egyptians as well as Greeks, and some of those Egyptians served as cavalry.

His replies begin on the fourth page. 

Reserved

Okay so we'll start with my impression of the campaign map. Okay first of all, I think it looks much BETTER in reality than it did in the Cleopatra trailer. For any of those worrying about the scale of the map, rest assured you can put that worry and burry it in the grave yard of thoughts you don't need anymore. Because its MASSIVE!

So I saw the politics screen 

Note that they said it was a WIP screen, but it looked pretty good, it was certainly more clean than I expected, but I have no idea how that will change between now and release. There are three families obviously, and these are divided in this screen according to their allegiance as far as I can tell. The info you learned in Stratagy informer was pretty accurate as far as I can tell..


So the big question!

Generals avatars are 3D active renders, which means they move around (slowly) and make faces while you look around. Ect. There were some interesting things to note, one of which was the variation. Sure some had similar Armour and such, but the faces were quite good looking.


CAMPAIGN 

I saw the differences between the desert parts of the campaign map, and the wilds of central Europe. And WOW! you can tell they have put an insane amount of effort into showing all these differences. Guys, I cannot stress enough how amazing this campaign map is in person. When you all get to use it for the first time. You are going to be totally immersed, and totally bound to the game. You WILL loose whole portions of your life to this game. 

The region system wasn't nearly as pronounced visually as I had expected, however this isn't a bad thing I don't think, as it was still fairly obvious how things are managed. The edicts system and army traditions system made perfect sense, however i will note that the interface is very different from what most of you are used to. So you may have to relearn your order of execute. 

DIPLOMACY

There are new diplomatic options just like everyone else has mentioned, the new rollout that shows you what the AI thinks of you isn't really complicated, not quite like I had expected. But actually I'm sort of happy that it lets you quickly see what you have done so you can know what to avoid in the future. Or how to put something negative to your advantage. 




PERFORMANCE 

Now I don't know what hardware they were using, my guess was the integrated video chips in the Intel CPU's from the HASWELL generation. If it was, then it makes some sense. I believe it may have been running at 720P with the graphics turned pretty high up. High at least, with SSAO on. Which is impressive all things considered. I think its going to run fairly smooth!


The battle 

Okay so now that I've really gotten down and played...4 battles. XD twice with Rome, and twice with Ptolomy. I can say that I am very impressed overall, even in its current state its extremely EPIC!! I mean seriously guys, the combat is pretty awesome, there is more feeling to the soldiers now than there were before. You've got really good sound, lots of cool things to hear!

In terms of battle speed I would say its about 25% slower than Shogun 2, Sure there was a rush on because we only had like 25 minutes to go through the campaign map and see what it was all about AND hopefully play both sides of the historical battle. 

Now I don't know if this means that you will be able to choose which side you play as in Historical battles. But in this case at least you could. (One was labeled easy, the other was Challenging)

NAVAL WARFARE AT ITS BEST: 

So during one of the battles I payed attention to the naval units they gave me, and I was definitely impressed. Both by the re-activity of the commands, and the way they handled themselves. BTW some units of ships have two ships per unit, and some DO NOT.. this appears to be mostly for siege based ships. 

The boarding was amazingly fluid, the ramming feels extremely powerful but not ridiculous, plenty of variation in the ships as well they didn't all look the same, at least not up close. Unless the ship is of a different type you likely won't be able to tell the differences from far away. Which is fine. Makes perfect sense. the larger ships of course look like larger ships from far away as they should. 

PHALANXES 

While this feature isn't finished yet of course, from what I could see of the phalanxes given to me, they act similar to the yari spear wall, where the units try and get in between the spears. The charge went semi threw the pikes, but there wasn't that invisible wall either. Im not sure about how I really feel this looked, It both looked EPIC and it felt very fluid, as did most of the other elements of the battle.

The animations were very brutal, and down to earth, there was lots and lots of different ones. They weren't kidding that this game will show you some of the most epic sights you will ever experience in a stratagy game. Lemme tell you all right now, your in for a treat!

Overall the men in the units felt both more unique and individual, while also being able to keep formation, and react to eachother, and enemies, as well as with their environment. This is probably one of the most upfront and stunning improvements with the battles. It felt VERY GOOD!

ELEPHANTS 

My god, this was the most impressive, fun thing to watch ever. Somehow they managed to make them feel extremely smooth, and reactive, both in animations and collateral damage. Arrows, and barbs stick out of their hides! And they go down hard in some cases. massive variation on animation from what I could tell. Almost felt like ragdoll but it wasn't. Much more realistic. 

Of all the things I saw, I think I was most impressed with how fluid, and realistic the battle felt. It didn't take too long, yet it didn't feel too quick either. 


UNIT CARDS 

Okay you all are gonna rag on these I'm sure. Honestly I really didn't like it at first. But WOW did it grow on me, I didn't expect that. The unit cards are certainly artistic, and they make sense given the culture. But honestly I thought they may be a bit too bright and contrasty. However It wasn't hard to really tell what your units are using just the cards. 

I actually love the unit cards now, as you play you may have the same thing happen to you. 

I will answer questions now if I can.. Look for my posts along this thread!

Voice acting 

Everything I heard felt pretty good. Except something about the Egyptian accent really threw me off, at first I thought it was a sound byte from Shogun 2. Of course I didn't think this the second time through. But my initial impression was still inaccurate. 

The battle music, and voice acting was very impressive! Felt like BF3 Vs BF2.. Rome 2 is powerful! And it feels like these people are actually in a battle. Fighting for their lives.

IN CLOSING:
Will and Craig were super awesome to meet in person, and they were very friendly and happy about the game! You can tell that they are extremely excited about Rome 2, so much so they have a hard time containing it. Also, they saw fit to tell everyone who I was. Which was very heart warming, and very cool. 

If any of you get a chance to talk to them in RL, like say at Rezzed. Even if you have to shell out money to get there. Its worth it just to feel the enthusiasm flowing from these guys. Thanks to the Total War Team, Craig, Will, and CA as a whole for providing this experience to those at E3 that were willing to wait to play the game, and thanks for doing such an amazing job on a game that has higher expectations than any other TW Game. So far it looks as if you are going to not only meet the majority of those expectations, but they may in fact raise the bar for the level of game that others will have to make to rise to the level of it.

Suebi: Ever since Rome II factions were announced I was planning on playing as them first, I don't know why but in every total war game I always play a German faction IE: R1-Germania (after a scipi campaign to unlock them) M2-HRE Empire-Austria Napoleon-Prussia 

Carthage: I have a deep love for Carthage, they were my favorite faction in R1, even though their  troops aren't good (excluding war elephants and sacred band) they have decent troops, great mercs and are an economic power house(in my most recent Carthage campaign(still going on) I was fighting Numidia all the Romans, Greece and Gaul at the same time(my protector it Spain was my only ally  but I traded with all neutral factions) I was winning all the wars, had huge elephant and long shield Calvary army's swarming Europe while building in all my cities and remained economically ahead of every one. 

Rome: It's rome total war (more content for rome than other factions I'm guessing). Also I'm a huge history geek  and love roman history ( I can name all ranks of the roman army and stuff like that (pre and post reforms) Also it would be cool to see what would happen if rome stayed a republic. 

Epirus: I think there the most underrated faction in the game, while the people who talk about the Greek factions are all blabbering about Sparta( who at this point is way past there golden age of Leonidas and stuff like that) Epirus could have destroyed rome at this time( and almost did) The generals from Epirus are  like the Spartans of generals (Leonidas time Spartans)

I just took Flanders and thus kicked the spanish out of northern europe. As Westphalia started attacking my capital the French send some armies up through Flanders. Several turns of hard won battles back-to-back left my army battered and without leadership. As i look across the border i see a near full stack and a half stack armies north-east of Paris ready to finish the job and overwhelm my poor clog-wearing dutch troops....

Needing more time to retrain and reinforce my troops, there is little i can do to save the situation, so i hit end-turn.

And then i saw them: A near full stack army of redcoats led by John Churchill landed on the shores of Calais and marched along the french-belgium border, pushing back the french and giving me time to regroup my army. My ally Great Britain has come to my aid!

I did this once before and a bunch of people here wanted to see pics, ones I sadly did not have :( so I repeated it, and here are the results:

I set out to destroy the mongols, abandoning everything else for this goal, i have a pretty crippled economy and that means this is a really crappy strategy for an end game win, but it's fun none the less.

I started with building 5 stacks:

[Balain and the Squires of Tripoli](http://i.imgur.com/Pb2Kq.jpg)

and[Prince Guy and the Templars](http://i.imgur.com/zwoVZ.jpg)


They were to march on the mongol horde deep in Turkish territory.



When [the forces met](http://i.imgur.com/x3KrV.jpg) it was a great gathering of military force. The Knights of Tripoli would form the Vanguard to engage as many of the enemy as possible at once.

[the Vanguard forms a battle line](http://i.imgur.com/PPt7U.jpg) and awaits the order to charge, and [charge they do](http://i.imgur.com/UMiTB.jpg) even as they are informed that reinforcements are delayed

As the first set of reinforcements(Guy and the Templars) enter the field, [Raymond has already obliterated the mongol line.](http://i.imgur.com/jHNwC.jpg) They never recover.

With the Templars delayed further by the terrain, [Raymond and the Knights of Tripoli give chase](http://i.imgur.com/I22dr.jpg) to the now mostly fleeing First Mongol army, dividing them in half.

[The Divide grows larger](http://i.imgur.com/zjsP7.jpg) as the second reinforcing army arrives (Balain and the Dismounted Knights) and Raymond and half his force engage one of the Reinforcing Mongol armies, as the other half engages [another](http://i.imgur.com/fICrk.jpg).

[the Knights of Tripoli eliminate the General of the First Mongol army](http://i.imgur.com/wXkS3.jpg)

[King Baldwin finally arrives](http://i.imgur.com/OA9j8.jpg) with the Knights of Jerusalem, even as the tide of battle becomes clearly on [favour of the Crusaders](http://i.imgur.com/eWpOv.jpg)

[The Army of Tripoli](http://i.imgur.com/30aR6.jpg) is starting to [loose it's force](http://i.imgur.com/kPwRz.jpg) as the reinforcements are taking forever to engage.

[The Second Mongol General Falls](http://i.imgur.com/lt1Rg.jpg)

[The army of Tripoli has fallen into disarray](http://i.imgur.com/ng3IC.jpg), even as they still manage to keep the mongol force split

1343549146.0,144,self.totalwar,xc363,A Semi-Comprehensive Guide to Mods for Rome: Total War,matbitesdog,162,18,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/xc363/a_semicomprehensive_guide_to_mods_for_rome_total/,"**Why Should I play Rome?**

Rome is a lot of people’s favorite TW game, and despite all the graphical and gameplay improvements that have gone on in the series since, the reasons are simple; *It has a diversity unmatched* in Medieval, Empire, or Shogun.

Lumbering Greek Phalanxes, Roman Legions, Axe-wielding Northern Barbarians, Hunnish Horse Archers, Successor Armies, Spanish Hill Tribes—Rome forces you to constantly change your tactics and deal with new threats as you battle new factions. It also has an elegant simplicity—units are responsive, charges and combat just feels ‘right’ in a way that, to me, was lacking in Medieval and Empire’s melee combat.

Perhaps the biggest reason to play Rome is the wealth of mods that have been worked on, and are still being developed, nearly 8 years later. These are some of the largest and most intricate mods that have probably ever been created, and there is a metric ass-ton of them. Figuring out which one you should play is daunting, especially when a campaign game could take anywhere from a few dozen to a few hundred hours. And questions of “What is this mod like?” are usually met with useless answers like “It’s fun!1!!1!” or “Just play it and see!”

**What is this guide, and who am I?**

I am just a guy who has played way too much Total War in his life, done some modding of the various games, and recently had foot surgery, which rendered me immobile for a few weeks. So of course I decided that I’d take a look at all the major Rome mods and figure out what they were about, how they played, what the campaigns and battles felt like, and then relate that unto you. 

**Some things/terms to know**

* *Program Files Problem:* If you spend any time on the forums, you’ll see people bitching about /Program Files problems. Make sure to turn off UAC, and give the installer administrative control, before installing a mod to a folder in /ProgramFiles AND when running the game. I simply turned off UAC and haven’t had a single problem. The reason is simple; when running the game, without Adminstractive control, UAC places newly created files (text strings and such) in a safe place, a place rome.exe doesn’t know about. At least, that’s what I gathered from people.

* *BAI:* The Battle AI.

* *CAI:* The Campaign AI

* *Hardcoded:* This refers to things, like aspects of the CAI and BAI, that modder’s can’t change because they were locked inside the .exe by the developers. These hardcoded behaviors can be 
Somewhat nullified or changed by scripting and careful balance, but they’re the source of Rome’s non-existent diplomacy and limited tactical abilities. Don’t let that scare you—many of these mods are absolutely fantastic at mitigating them.

* *.exe’s:* Rome has two expansions, Barbarian Invasion and Alexander. Along with Rome, that means there are three ‘executable program files’ that can actually be used to run Rome. Each has slightly different behaviors, and the mod’s forum pages will let you see which one you should use. When people say bi.exe or alx.exe, this is what they mean. (Switching .exe’s is kind of an advanced concept, and not recommended willy-nilly.)

* *Modfoldered:* This simply means that the mod comes in its own folder, doesn’t do anything to the actual Rome installation, and needs to be run by a launcher or with a steam launch command.

* *Vanilla:* Un-modded Rome.

* *Advisor Script:* Most major mods perform a lot of their actions through scripts, cunningly run at the end of every turn through the game’s advisor. To play the mod as its intended, and without giving your game crippling errors and ctd’s, you HAVE to run the script every time you start, and some mods break when you attempt to quickload. Quick savers are scum, anyway. Best practice is to always exit out of the entire program and then reload it, when you need to reload a save, and then make sure you activate the script as soon as it starts.

* *Patches:* If you’re using Steam, you have the gold edition, which is fully patched Rome with Barbarian Invasion. If you don’t, to install a mod you need a clean install of Rome, patched to 1.5, and then have Barbarian Invasion installed and patched to 1.6.

**Is Vanilla that bad?**

No. 

If you haven’t played it, or haven’t played it in a long time, it’s definitely worth a shot. Most of these mods are drastic overhauls of everything about the game, and if you don’t know how the game plays, how’d you know what you want improved?

Rome is a-historical and fast-paced. But the units control really well, you know what everything does by looking at it, the economy and city-building parts are logical and make sense. Playing as a Roman is great fun, as Rome is represented by three ruling families and the senate, which means that when one faction grows too powerful, a civil-war breaks out, really adding a sense of struggle and progression to the end game. Playing as other factions is still fun, to.

~~LLLLthis is here to break up the textLLLL~~

**Expansions**

**Barbarian Invasion** is a proper expansion in the sense that the word used to mean. It adds cool new religion and horde mechanics, and features a dark ages setting rarely explored in games. The Roman Empire has split in half and is plagued by rebellion, barbarians pour in from the east looking for new lands to call home, and greedy factions eye the carnage with an eye on expansion. BI kicks off with basically the Mongol invasion from Medieval II on steroids, and the world changes very rapidly as the barbarian factions ravage across Europe. It’s a totally unique TW experience and one that should be explored further.

*The BI .exe file features better naval invasions, and a more aggressive AI that makes better use of cavalry then Rome does.*

**Alexander** is not really an expansion. I haven’t played it, because it features a very small map, a handful of factions, and a short campaign time-span. If you like that kinda thing, then go for it. *It’s worth installing if you have it on Steam for the .exe file, which is generally considered more stable and has better BAI and smarter, but less aggressive CAI, then BI or Rome.*

**So, my post is massively over the reddit character limit. So, unfortunately for the concept of simplicity, I will submit each of my analysis's as a comment on this post.**

I was playing as Lithuania on M2TW and got back stabbed by Hungary, who besieged Halych with two armies. I had basically given up hope and just started the battle to kill as many as I could to make recapturing easier. Lo and Behold, the first general dies to my Baltic spear men and the second to a freaking peasant unit. I managed to chain rout about seven units with one spear unit (two of which were on the walls) I was shaking by the end and when the last enemy unit routed I wanted to scream but couldn't because it was too late at night lol. Sorry I don't have any screenshots I was too busy micromanaging and sweating bullets. The only thing that comes close to this feeling was when I beat the campaign as Hattori, which I thought was impossible.

*I tried my best to add the proper documentary to the factions in the game. Some of them (such as Epirus) aren't the proper documentaries, and for a faction like Pontus, there are no documentaries, so I just added a wiki link instead. Lastly, some of the links are documentaries not exactly about the faction that will be present in-game, but pretty close.  

But I thought this would be a pretty good way of getting to know the background on some these factions that some of us might me devoted to also to just to immerse oneself in the period that we will be wallowing our free time away. Also if anybody know of some good documentaries for any of the factions add them in here. Cheerio!

I try to sort out the awesome stuff into our front page news.

So I plan to, at least right now I likely plan to, create a weekly TWC News post here, detailing the most important news from the site in the past week or so (it all depends on how much we have). I know there are some minor announcements that not everyone here would care about, but I am sure anything such as a Rome II giveaway, major mod release, or CA exclusives would be of interest?

So without further delay, here is my first post of this sort. And yes, it involves a **Rome II giveaway!**

1372209377.0,122,self.totalwar,1h2t5o,A comment on Rome II's new Army System,zarroc123,146,24,75,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1h2t5o/a_comment_on_rome_iis_new_army_system/,"So, in respect to those who may not be aware, Rome II is going to be implementing a new Army system. In my understanding (And feel free to correct me if I'm wrong), Armies will now have their own experience/leveling system. So, for example, the Thirteenth Legion will have it's own experience bar, and with it you can gain ""Traditions"". These traditions will make your Army have better morale, more effective at Siege battles, and other useful but not overpowering bonuses to give each army some dynamic. So, in effect, this means you can have an Army that's particularly good at sieges, while also having an Army that excels in open fields. The most interesting part, in my opinion, is that if your Army is destroyed you can raise the banner anew and all your piss green new recruits can benefit from the traditions of the older (and now deceased) army. I like this quite a bit because Caesar actually did this with his Thirteenth legion. Thirteen was considered an unlucky number, as many of you may know, and Caesar created a Thirteenth legion to specifically challenge that superstition. It was, unfortunately, utterly destroyed in an ambush due to poor Roman leadership, as well as clever planning by the Gallic rebels. Most took this as an omen that the gods were pissed at Caesar for challenging his lucky number. But, Caesar being the egotistical (albeit brilliant) guy that he was, he remade the thirteenth legion and put it under his personal command. The legion then went on to kick a lot of ass, and became super awesome and all that. And Caesar proved he was better than a number. ALRIGHT. So, I approve of this new system, but I want to open it to discussion to all you redditors. Do you like it? Do you think it adds a layer of dynamic complexity, or mires the game in useless tidbits? As I said, I like the system, but I want one little thing to be added to it. As most of you may know, Roman legions were centered around their legionary eagle. Like religiously. It makes modern day flag etiquette look like a joke. They would literally commit mass suicide on top of it just to hide it from the enemy under a pile of bodies. So, in my humble opinion, I think that if your Army gets completely destroyed, that you must RECLAIM the legionary eagle in order to remake the army with all its level/perks/etc. This could create a real dynamic aspect to the game. Enemy factions could take the eagle if they find it, and in order to reclaim it you have to conquer whatever army/city it's in. You may have to readjust battle plans in order to reclaim a particularly valuable armies eagle. I think its a perfect bit of historical accuracy that would also add an awesome dynamic to the game. How about it?

TL;DR What are your opinions on the new Army system? Any suggestions for improvement? Do you like the idea of a particular armies levels and traits being tied to their Legionary eagle? (The legionary eagle is my idea, not implemented in the game [as far as I know])

EDIT: I added a disclaimer that the lagionary eagle thing was my idea in the TL;DR to avoid confusion. Also, in retrospect, this post is long and convoluted.

So let's have an open discussion now about what you, the /r/totalwar community, want from us.

Anything you can think of you feel is relevant to the sub, from rules to flairs to contests to general direction for the sub. 

Obvious first point to discuss would be: Flairs. We've gotten the series-flairs done (When I say we I mean mcnoodlenuts, so thank him for that.) but some of you have been mentioning more (faction) flairs.
I'm not at the point yet with coding skills that I can be of use here, so flairs at the moment are all on Noodle. Please keep that in mind.

Next to flairs we have our first contest running. I'm honestly a bit disappointed by the turnout (I count 5 entries so far) but so be it. Hopefully we get some more late entries.

Currently in process: The history lesson posts by probablynotlying. These are coming to the sidebar Soon©. PNL preferred to touch them up before we put them up, so once he's happy with them they'll be added to the sidebar.

Another thing I'm working on, albeit on a low burner, is a complete Mod Compendium. A comprehensive post listing each mod per game, ideally with a short explanation. This is something I want to do well, so it'll be a bit of work, but I'm working on it.

So knowing this, let's hear it. Let's hear what you'd like to see implemented, altered or scrapped. What your thoughts for the sub are. Where you want us to focus our efforts first.

The player choice in how each character develops means that the system behind gaining experience and 'leveling up' is more important than ever.

I would like to see a system where the experienced gained by a General is closely related to the battle odds calculated at the start of the battle. Harder battles gain more experience whilst simply turning up with a full stack to obliterate some peasants earns smaller rewards, perhaps even no reward (and the chance, a la Medieval 2, some negative traits). 

This system would encourage fighting battles on more equal footing to the enemy (giving the AI a slightly better chance), encourage players to fight riskier battles and discourage steamrolling with large stacks. It would also be more rewarding when you win heroic, against the odds victories as your 1 star general may jump up a couple of levels quickly as he is recognised as a tactical genius.

Perhaps also put in a 10% bonus to any other General's serving in the army so you can properly utilise a mentor system.

I have been playing various games in the Total War series for many years.  I have always had a strong tendency to prefer playing the underdog factions that begin very small, and have found enjoyment in ""nurturing/growing"" a single-province faction run by a very small Royal Family.  In fact, I often lose interest once my faction grows to 8-10 provinces, as by that point I seem to be spending far too much time on shitty border skirmishes that I don't quite fully trust the AI to handle for me.

I recently re-installed E:TW and decided to deliberately play a game totally different from my norm.  I checked out the larger factions, selected the only Islamic playable faction - the Ottoman Empire, and dove right in.

So strange!  I started with like a dozen provinces or so, already a huge sprawling empire that controls the eastern half of the Mediterranean, but upon closer inspection I can see that most of my holdings have NO GUARDS AT ALL, and in addition to being virtually unprotected, most of my empire has only the most rudimentary infrastructure already in place.

Expand?  Conquer?  Not bloody likely!  It looks like I'll have to desperately fortify the hell out of this shit for the foreseeable future before I even consider spitting in the eye of one of my neighbours.  The first thing I did was build roads.  Beautiful roads.  I need to connect this vast middle-eastern empire, Allah willing, not only for necessary trade, but potentially to move what meager Ottoman troops I seem to possess should military mobilization be needed.

Relentlessly dogged by a deep paranoia that a ""friendly"" neighbour would notice what a weak shell I am, declare war, and devour one of my under-protected settlements after another led me to invest far more effort into the diplomacy game than I ever had before in previous TW campaigns.  I opened trade agreements with every single nation that would have me, and lavished what gifts I could afford on anyone who seemed to be angry with my decrepit Ottoman ""Empire"".

So much of the Ottoman empire's starting regions are essentially a license to print money.  When you really examine their beginning position on the map, although they have nearly no military resources, they control an obscene amount of trade opportunities.  At least half - if not the majority - of Ottoman starting provinces are coastal, which means you can cash in on the sea trade massively once you get a bit of infrastructure set up.

By neurotically checking/modifying my diplomacy every single turn, and focusing almost entire on infrastructure while desperately praying I won't be betrayed by one of my ""trustworthy neighbours"", I managed to go something like 50 turns before my first military situation, period.  No auto-resolves, nothing, I rocked a gloriously improbable Pax Ottomana for so long that my Sultan aged into an old man and some of my agents spent their entire lives free of conflict zones.

My strategy was simple: fight only wars of defense until I felt technologically/militarily equal with Europe.  Or as close to it as I was likely to get.  It's worth noting the Ottomans have an absolutely abysmal naval situation going on.  You have to research every naval tech, and your starting naval infrastructure is mostly fishing ports with no more than a few light galleys as protection.

Somewhere around turn 50 I was finally betrayed by greedy European scum, although leading up to that event every turn felt like being a 103 year old man surprised to wake up each morning unmolested by the grim reaper.  Of course, this eventual bullshit came from the Venetians.  Awfully ambitious for a minor nation.  They made a play for Athens, and although they really should have won, and certainly would have won were it auto-resolved, I pulled an amazingly improbable and absurd victory out of my ass and somehow kept it in one of the most gruesome Pyrrhic victories I've ever had the pleasure of personally supervising. 

Fast forward several more turns of careful diplomacy, peace at almost any cost, and unwavering focus on financial gains... my Ottoman empire is now very strong.  What little knowledge of ""real world history"" I've got has caused me to prioritize the keeping of fertile Egypt an absolute priority, and I like to think of it as my breadbasket.  I developed Jerusalem and Damascus as twin cities, and much like Egypt, the residents of my Pax Ottomana Middle Eastern regions enjoy an easy comfortable life of peaceful trade and haven't even known a single incident of political violence since the moment I started the campaign.

Naturally I know this can't last.  As the game progresses the AI factions begin to devour one another and grow bigger.  For years I was allied with all my neighbours, and watched helplessly as my Islamic brother Persia was completely swallowed whole by a seemingly unstoppable Maratha Confederacy, which now borders me and has assumed the role of ""super threatening douchebag neighbour"".  In a bizarre twist, Prussia took Morroco.  I think I may be the only hope of Islam left in the world, and in this version of the Middle East, it really does stand for an empire of peaceful learning and vibrant trade.

My new goal at all times is to be at TOTAL PEACE as much as possible, but with the caveat that I never, ever, give away territory under any circumstances.  So far it's going great.  Now I'll stop typing and go continue my Pax Ottomana...

Basically, I was experimenting by focusing on non-violent development over warmongering, and attempting to see how far I could go fighting only wars of defense and pouring enormous resources into diplomatic solutions to conflict.

Original thread (including update 1):  http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/12gkjr/fortify_vs_expand_proscons_of_starting_with_a/

I was happily surprised by the positive feedback and requests to keep you guys updated as the campaign got deeper/more weird.  I started this second update thread because I was worried nobody would even notice the updates in the comment section of a thread that's almost a week old.  I hope nobody minds!  

UPDATE 2: To those who asked for a follow-up installment on my Total Peace experiment, sorry for the delay! I haven't had too much spare time with which to guide my gentle, benevolent, peace-mongering version of the Ottoman Empire. Until today!

Now... where were we... ah, yes....

*ahem*

After reigning for nearly fifty years of fantastically improbable peace (particularly by Total War standards), the most kind and generous of all Earthly rulers, the glorious Sultan Mustafa II, chosen mortal embodiment of the will of Allah, blessed be his name for all time, quietly passed away of natural causes while nestled comfortably in the very finest of Oriental silk sheets deep within the opulent royal apartments of the capital city. His son, the infinitely wise and merciful Ahmed III, assumed the only remaining Islamic throne amidst much fanfare and celebration in the streets of Istanbul.

Ahmed III learned well the lessons of his father's reign, and continued with the firm policy of Pax Ottomana. I sort of assumed Ahmed would be a young man, but when I pulled up his character information through the government panel I was surprised to learn he was already quite old. Although he had only just taken the throne, he was already over 60 years of age!

Life around the Eastern Mediterranean remained almost impossibly idyllic under the new Sultan. Each turn I carefully tweaked my diplomacy, ensuring that nobody was building up a grudge against me. Citizens in Jerusalem, Damascus, Baghdad and Alexandria who had never even seen a single glimpse of warfare under the long-lived regime of Mustafa II found that their peaceful existence remained delightfully uninterrupted by conflict.

Despite a few brief violent episodes as I ""politely introduced myself"" to the Inuit and the Danes of Iceland, the haunting sound of the Islamic call to prayer began regularly echoing across the frozen landscape of the Canadian tundra, answered only by the eerie howls of timber wolves and the ambient mechanical sounds of my thriving nascent arctic fishing/fur industry.

Having effortlessly annexed both Iceland and the Inuit Nations, I found myself resisting the temptation to start knocking heads and devouring territory all over the place. I had to remind myself that this particular campaign was an experimental campaign, an attempt to see how far I could get with my Total Peace strategy. It may sound a bit silly, but I suppose I was using my imagination to role-play what I like to think of as the best possible leader one could be lucky enough to have in real life. Rather than punching noses and gobbling up territory hand over fist, I dedicated myself to providing the ""best, most lucrative and peaceful lives possible"" for the 41 million people that lived within my Ottoman borders. Instead of troops and guns, I built schools and factories. Instead of warships, I built fleets of trading dhows to harvest income from the Brazilian coast.

This campaign had grown a bit absurd. I was allied with Sweden and the Maratha Confederacy, the latter having consumed Persia and grown into a bloated superpower that had really started making me nervous every single turn. However, each major nation was my friend, all of them displaying at least +100 in the diplomacy math mouse-over thing. Well, except Russia.

I had just forcibly ejected the Scots and the Irish from the British Isles, and turned my attention to the continent. I had not yet earned the ire of the French, and set about building an army in Caen so that I could put France to the torch. Then a new pope was elected. French. The bastard.


I was playing on hard difficulty (campaign and map), and didn't have an economy which could withstand the inevitable excommunication should I move out. So I gathered up my army with 3 members of the royal family, bundled them on a dinghy, and sent them to Jerusalem, as all good Catholics should.


What followed then is still one of my favourite gaming experiences ever. I would attack a barely defended town (most of the Muslim armies were in the field killing each other), and assault immediately as my ballistae could take down the gates. The populace were put to the sword, all of the buildings were demolished for cash, and I would march on to the next city, triumphant. Once I was gone though, I would raise the taxes exorbitantly, ensuring that rebels would quickly seize the town. The Egyptian army would need to forcibly take back their own city.


The whole of the Fertile Crescent was demolished by my rampaging army, which never fought the Egyptians head on. Any casualties were immediately replaced by mercenaries, and England was awash with Egyptian gold. For  many years this went on, until I had only one prince left in Egypt, who was both cruel and thoroughly mad. Then the plague struck. The army was decimated, but still capable. They sustained it for a few years until it passed. My Mad Prince kept the plague, but would not die. It transpired that whichever city he took was sacked, demolished, taken by rebels, AND inflicted with plague (which he seemed to do personally, as he was the only person who still had it). He was a harbinger of doom.


Eventually, he was cornered in some Turkish valley, and his army scattered. The funds he raised enabled England to completely level most of Europe, regardless as to the Pope's wishes. I still can't remember the prince's name. This whole episode gave me a giddy thrill unmatched by any other gaming moment, except shooting some interloper on DayZ. I was very disappointed with Empire, when you couldn't sack things... :'(

TL,DR: Sent God of War to Fertile Crescent, thoroughly fucked shit up.

There were revolts everywhere. The 4 prior english kings were murderers, dreaded all over the world. But I really had fun playing the role of King Aster the Rightious. I genuinely had a smile on my face when I read his title after years of playing with this mindset. Sure, the game was much harder past that point, but I merely played harder, doing justice to his legendary leadership. He would be the King Arthur of this world(and he had a similar posse of elite generals I favoured as well)

His legacy spanned becoming King of England, France and Cyprus at Age 35 to owning the majority of Europe, North Africa and the Holy Lands due to his spectacularly successful crusade *during* the ""Mongol Invasion"" event(literally defeating a combined total of 15-20 full stacks of Mongols and various middle eastern countries) at the age of 65, playing as Aster was one of the greatest, most satisfying campaigns I've conducted in my career of Medieval II: Total War. The highlight of the game was the year of his death, when the pope excommunicated him and I personally put him at the head of an army that sailed from Jerusalem to the shores of Italy and eventually Rome. He died one turn after abolishing the Papacy, who in that game, were a constant source of worry, bloodshed and chaos... and who had always supported his forefathers.

1372879473.0,102,self.totalwar,1hl3v3,On Elephants and Their Use in Warfare,Commodorez,115,13,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1hl3v3/on_elephants_and_their_use_in_warfare/,"This post will provide a brief synopsis of elephants and their use in the wars of antiquity.

Originally the use of elephants for war was confined to India and south east Asia. It was not until Alexander the Great's invasion of India and the [Battle of the Hydaspes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_the_Hydaspes) that western powers considered the elephant as a weapon of war. The Macedonian generals made a note of how difficult it had been to overcome the creatures, and after the death of Alexander, each of the diadochi wanted a corps of elephants in their army and began importing them from India. At around this time the Carthaginians began taming the smaller African forest elephants for use in their armies. Eventually the Seleucid Empire blocked the trade of elephants from India and its rivals, namely the Ptolemeic Empire, resorted to using the smaller African forest elephant as well.

* **Types of Elephants**
There are three species of elephant: [African bush](http://wordsasunder.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/elephant.jpg), [African forest](http://www.theanimalfiles.com/images/african_forest_elephant_1.jpg), and [Indian elephants.](http://www.konicaminolta.com/kids/endangered_animals/library/field/img/a-elephant_img01-l.jpg) Both African species have large, triangular ears, two ""fingers"" on their trunks, and have a concave shape to their backs. The Indian species have small, round ears, one ""finger"" on the trunk, have a convex shape to their backs, and have two bulbous protrusions on their foreheads. The African species tend to have longer tusks than the Indian species. The bush elephant averages 10.8 feet/3.3 meters tall and 5.5 tonnes in weight. The Indian averages 9 feet/2.7 meters tall and 3 tonnes in weight. The smallest and most docile are the forest elephants averaging 8 feet/ 2.5 meters high and 2.7 tonnes in weight. Sadly, the forest elephant is no longer found in northern Africa. Its range has been reduced to just the Congo region. The bush elephant, is not considered tameable or trainable. Elephants can not run, trot or gallop; they can, however, ""powerwalk"" at an average of 10 miles per hour/16 km per hour.

* **Acquisition and Training**
We're not sure if breeding programs were attempted (Pyrrhus of Epirus is suspected of attempting to breed a herd), but we do know it was simply not economically sound to breed your own herds of battle elephants. The long gestation period, long amount of time it takes to reach maturity, huge amount of food required, and the space needed to support an ever growing herd would be a drain on the state's resources. Therefore, it was a more sound strategy to trap and train young wild elephants. After an elephant was captured, it had to be broken. This was a process by which an elephant was tamed and made to depend on its mahout for all its life needs. After it was deemed broken, it would begin a training process that usually lasted three years. It's worth noting that it must always be the same [mahout](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahout) that carries out the training and care for an elephant. The two would remain bonded and the elephant would rarely follow the directions of another. Elephants were given impressive names, much like tanks or ships today, such as Surus, the mount of Hannibal Barca. A mahout (or Indoi as the successors called them) would ride [seated on his mount's neck](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/mahout-elephant-18094374.jpg) and used his voice, pressure from his feet applied to his mount's ears, and a three foot long hook called and [ankush,](http://s3.hubimg.com/u/5120190_f260.jpg) which was used to reach the sensitive mouth and inner ear. The head of a successor state's elephant corps was known as the elephantarchos.

Usually elephants carried colorful [cloth pads](http://www.thailandsworld.com/sites/thailandsworld_com/images/history%2FWarElephant16Cstyle.jpg) on their backs. Sometimes they were covered in warpaint, or equipped with harnesses covered in bells, which would have made them effective terror weapons to those unaccustomed to the sight or sound they produced on the charge. Atop of the creature, along with the mahout, was a warrior armed with a sarrissa, javelins, or a bow that would help defend the mahout as well as add to the offensive power of the elephant. Eventually, [armor](http://chessrex.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/War-Elephant.jpg) [was developed](http://img1.photographersdirect.com/img/11943/wm/pd330944.jpg) to protect the elephant. An innovation by the by the successors was the [thorakia,](http://www.arthursclipart.org/elephants/elephants/war%20elephant%202.gif) a wooden tower that was secured tightly to the animal with chains that could hold up to four men. The smaller forest elephants could not support the weight of a thorakia. Often, the elephant's tusks were reinforced with caps of iron or bronze that would feature sharp spikes or blades that could be used to gore an enemy. Often each elephant accompanied by a squad of light troops, usually equipped with javelins, a sword, and a small shield such as the Iberian caetra, that would protect the elephant's vulnerable belly and backside or exploit any chaos in the enemy ranks caused by the elephants. The mahout would be armored as well as any noble in his country.

* **In Battle**
The most common tactic was to form your elephants in a line directly in front of your army and charge them at the enemy army. Afterwards infantry would come to exploit the chaos created and route the enemy. Sometimes elephants were kept in reserve or on the flanks, but the most common tactic was just a charge straight into the enemy army.

* Against Infantry

When fighting infantry an elephant would lash out against, throw, or crush an enemy with its trunk, crush an enemy with its forehead, gore an enemy with its tusks, or just trample their enemy.

* Against Other Elephants

When fighting other elephants they would [charge to meet their opponent head on.](http://c3co.org/calhouncommons/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/100222_0706_EleFight-Small1.jpg) They would lock tusks and commence with a shoving match, trying to turn the other elephant on its side or knock it over. Afterwards they would gore their opponent with their tusks, maiming or killing the other elephant. The warriors on its back would be trying to [kill the other elephant's mahout,](http://i901.photobucket.com/albums/ac218/Aliraqi2/February%202010/world%20pix/8-2/elephant-fight_1574000i.jpg) without whom the elephant would panic and run. It's worth noting that all but the largest of forest elephants would shy away from combat with an Indian elephant. Their size and foreign smell would frighten them enough to send them away without confrontation.

* **Cons of Having Elephants**
A fact that is sadly true today, is that in captivity elephants have drastically reduced lifespans. This means the upkeep for a herd would have been enormous, even more so for empires that didn't border India or Africa. Elephants also had a tendency to panic and flee back the direction they came from, often towards the armies that had unleashed them in the first place.

And in SS, they changed the available units to recruit based on the year, but outdated units didnt disapear. So mailed knights were available early on while advanced armored troops came in later years.

A thing that bugged me in MTWII, Empire, and to a lesser extent FOTS. Was when i had a unit of knights or line infantry that was really experienced, but became obsolete because new technologies or buildings allowed a similar but superior version of the troops to be trained. ex: feudal knights =&gt; armored swordsmen and line infantry =&gt; imperial/shogunate infantry.

My thought is that maybe the player can choose to retrain units for a small fee and upgrade their equipment/weapons and transform them into a new/better type of unit while maintaining the unit's experience. Potentially you could altogether change the unit from spearman to swordsman but a major change like that could maybe take away some experience.

Since Rome II will take place over a long time period and troops will change, it would be nice to be able to keep your experienced units from the beginning

also bring back retraining a unit when a new armor upgrade is available

tldr i want to be able to retrain a unit into another type in order to keep experience

edit: can anyone mod this into any existing Total War games?

edit2: comments have given good suggestions like only carrying the morale and not experience, taking away a number of experience levels based on the magnitude of change for the troops, as a sort of learning curve for the troops with new equipment. As well pooling the unit types such as only militia being able to retrain and become other militia and nobles only retraining to become other noble type units.",,False,self,t5_2rq9c,1360725678.0,,,True,t3_18e82v,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/18e82v/retraining_options_for_rome_ii/,

First of all, thank you for this awesome sub, it's great coming here and seeing how others play and experience this great game. And though I have more than 300 hours already put in various versions, you guys always manage to teach me something new.

Now I think we all know the posts I'm talking about. Often they are victories, with 1 or 2 screenshots of the end of the battle, showing the numbers of the battle and in the title a small description of how it was managed.
My idea is for the mods to create one thread per week where everyone can post their greatest victory/defeat/battle of the week in the comments, accompanied by a description and screenshots.

This way we can have one weekly thread full of cool stories and advice instead of the occasional and, in my opinion, boring victory post.

I'm curious to your opions on this. Also I apologize if I have made any mistakes, English is not my native language.

1348340383.0,98,self.totalwar,10b3v7,Compilation - Everything we know about Rome 2,Dazzius,104,6,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/10b3v7/compilation_everything_we_know_about_rome_2/,"Hi. This text should hopefully answer some of your questions on Rome 2
General
- Biggest TW-game yet. 40% larger budget and a much larger staff than before. 
- Will release in 2013, no official date has been set. 
- Big new features involve : Combined naval and land battles, a new province system that reduces micromanagement, more ""human"" - ie. factions will behave like people and choices you make in the campaign via the new dilemma system will make big differences. 
- Will be more historically accurate than the first one.

Campaign and factions 
- A much larger campaign map than Rome 1. Some unconfirmed sources claim that it's going to be Scotland to current Afghanistan(or Bactria as it was known then) 
- The campaign map will be made in the same engine as the battle map. 
- The dilemma system from Shogun 2 will return, in a more advanced form. Choices you make now have lasting effects on your faction, and making a choice can lead to another dilemma, etc etc. 
- The campaign map will now be made up Provinces. Provinces will consist of several Regions. Recruiting, building structures, and changing taxes will be made from the Provincial capital. Losing a region will make you lose all of the money you get from that region. 
Factions 
- There will be a total of 50-60 factions at launch. 
- The amount of playable factions will be the same as Rome 1. Note : You will start the game with all factions unlocked, unlike Rome 1. 
- Confirmed factions are : Rome, Carthage, Sparta, Egypt, Macedon, Germania, Gaul** * Unlike Rome 1, all of the major Greek cities will be their own faction. It is therefore pretty certain that Athens and Thebes will be in aswell. ** Macedon is not really confirmed, but it's been stated that there will be both a Greek phalanx and a macedonian phalanx. Can't really have a Macedonian phalanx without Macedonia *** It's unknown if these factions will just be called Germania and Gaul or if there will be several tribes. 
- Factions will have unique personalities - some might be more aggresive, some might be vengeful if you attack them, and some might be passive and ignore you. 
- Every faction will have their own tech tree.

Battles 
- There will be combined sea and land battles. 
- Battles will be larger than ever before, with more soldiers per unit and enormous battlemaps up to 9 square kilometres. 
- Navies can now attack from the sea, and take over provinces. There is no longer a clear line between armies and navies. 
- Naval battles will be mainly ramming, boarding, and sometimes employing special tactics such as the harpax - a harpoon like device that pulls in enemy ships. 
- Factions will fight differently. The Romans might try to just crush everything with their powerful heavy infantry, while the germanians use terrain and flanking effectively, and the eastern factions have deadly horsearchers. 
- Will have 700 units in total at launch. 
- Soldiers will fight 1vs1, but the combat will be faster and more brutal than in Shogun 2. Things like phalanxes will however not use 1v1. 
- Cities now have multiple capture points, unlike previous games where there was only 1 in the middle of the city. This means that as the defender, you need to be flexible and cunning to beat the attacker, instead of being able to ""camp"". 
- Occasionally, scripted events can occur - in the ""Siege of Carthage"" demo one such event was when a group of elephants came charging down the street. These events will be random and should add some variety to the battles. 
- There will be a pig unit. 
- Soldiers will NOT be able to climb walls. There will be ladders and siegetowers.

Technical news 
- The engine will be a modified version of the Warscape engine. 
- New graphicsengine. Better looking lighting, and particles having shadows are some of the new features. 
- More human and organic - soldiers will react to things like their fellow soldiers getting hit by an arrow and officers will give orders to their troops and they will respond to them are a few examples. 
- More detailed soldiers than ever. More experienced soldiers will look more determined and hardened then their newbie friends. Shogun 2 had roughly 400 different skins, Rome 2 will have over 1500. 
- Much more detailed and fierce combat animations. 
- In previous TW-games, the campaign AI and the diplomacy AI were 2 different things. This time, they will be combined, which should lead to a less erratic and random AI. 
- More AI-programmers have been hired to improve the AI, both in battles and in general.

Multiplayer
- Almost nothing is know about MP at the moment, only that CA has ""big plans for the multiplayer"" and ""something so big we do not know if it's technically achiveable"".",,False,self,t5_2rq9c,1348424269.0,,,True,t3_10b3v7,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/10b3v7/compilation_everything_we_know_about_rome_2/,

First off, thank you to everyone who put themselves forward to help moderate this reddit.  I would say that everyone that offered their help in [the thread ](http://redd.it/1ez8u1) would have been a worthy edition, but having 15 or so mods might be overkill :). 

We chose two candidates who we thought would be good contributors to the team, and who can really help with all the housekeeping around here and more.

So if everyone could please welcome the New Mods on the Block;

/u/McNoodleNuts

/u/Ymirism 

As soon as I'm done crafting this thread I'll be promoting them and hopefully over the next while you'll start to see some changes around here.  

I'd also like to use this thread as an opportunity for folks to submit any ideas that they may like to see implemented on the reddit.  So feel free to let us know what you think might improve the reddit, or ways that you think both the new and old mod team can work with you folks, the community, to keep /r/TotalWar a vibrant and fun place to visit.

We'll take everyone's comments into consideration, but we also don't want to stray from our ""core values"" that have served us so well to this point.  Primarily letting the community decide whats good and bad using votes (rather than heavy-handed moderation), having the community be the primary drivers to content, and basically just letting everyone participate in the way that they'd like to.

Thank you again to everyone who put themselves forward for moderation duties, and to the community as a whole for working with us on this.

Cheers!

Now, there are instances were like in Medieval 2 your troops get bloody.

And there is the horrendous blood pack dlc in Shogun 2, honestly why would i want 8bit comical blood gushing out of my units? but i'm a sucker and I still bought, and use it...

So my greatest wish for Rome 2 is blood, screaming, dismembering, burning and crushing. Yes I know i sound like a psychopath but they talk so much about realism and yet the battles are so romanticized.

 And I think it would be a really nice touch to an otherwise extremely well executed franchise, imagine the horror of sending your troops on a suicide mission. hearing them die and screaming on the ground. I think it would add a new emotional element to the battles, your troops would no longer just be lines of 1&amp;0, they would become real men. 

To avoid the age restriction they could just copy the setup for Shogun, in the sense that it will be a dlc. 

Please forgive my English as it is not my native tongue and i can see the sun rising along the shoreline. ZZZzzzz

Great response, i thought for sure i was going to be downvoted for my ""extreme"" views. Glad to know i'm not the only one whom wants CA to release a DlC with a higher PG rating, so to speak.

Anyone who reads about military history or tactics has surely read about the importance of protecting your own food and equipment supply, as well as the advantage to be gained by destroying that of your enemies.  Most armies would have a supply train or baggage train that would follow along behind all the soldiers, a place where camp followers, soldier's families, prostitutes and a variety of other riff raff would congregate and try to profit in some way off the spoils of the war, living in the wake of the army itself.

I guess you can make an argument that says when your agent performs ""sabotage army"" on the enemy, what you're really doing is basically fucking with their logistics in some way.  Or when you sabotage/raid an enemy farm, I suppose that's denying food to your enemy, but that only applies in their home provinces.

Thankfully with the newer games they have implemented winter attrition.  I rolled my eyes so hard when I first played Empire Total War and could just lounge around the Russian or Canadian arctic for years on end in the middle of the plains, far from civilization.  As someone who lives in Canada, trust me, you can literally die in an hour or two from the air itself if you don't have proper attire on a particularly cold winter day.

I would love to see a similar mechanic implemented for desert areas, where your army falls apart due to thirst and sun stroke.  Historically, Napoleon was drastically unprepared for the climate his troops would experience in Egypt and as a result it almost proved disastrous for him.

The truth is that at the end of the day, the fiercest opponent many armies ever face is the terrain itself.  After all, nobody kicked Hannibal's ass quite like the Alps did.

I imagine that the biggest impediment to putting more supply line or logistics stuff in the game is that it's straight up not that fun.  It's awkward, time consuming, and probably at the end of the day it wouldn't be an improvement.

Perhaps a new element to upkeep where your armies require not only gold as payment, but also a certain amount of upkeep measured in food supply?  And when you are in hostile lands you have to manually take x amount of rations with you, which would set more realistic limits on how long you can leisurely traipse around the deserts of Numidia or whatever.  

What do you think?  At some point is there just too much realism, and it ruins the fun?",,False,self,t5_2rq9c,False,,,True,t3_181pqb,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/181pqb/supply_lines_the_missing_game_mechanic/,

I decided that it would be better to rename the mod so no one would expect me to build a whole RPG into the game. I still might add some features like custom armor and stuff, but that is not really part of the challenge I wanted to take on and will only be a small gimmick once i add such stuff to the mod.

Now the fun part: The technical part of the mod is nearly finished. I got everything to work in C++ and added really cool features to make the mod more handy in terms of controlling your army while playing the general. Now the game will always guide your camera to the general when you leave the third person and will put everything in super slowmotion, which looks really nice. I will upload a video in a few days, but i lent my GTX660 to my brother for a few days, because his gcard broke and now I'm not able to record gameplay...

Some pictures enclosed.,XavierObidiah,97,10,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1gx9sd/my_experience_of_total_war_rome_ii_at_rezzed_some/,"I was one of the lucky people who went to Rezzed this weekend at Birmingham and got my hands on Total War: Rome II to play! There was one battle available to play, that being the Battle of the Nile, and I played as both Egypt and Rome a couple of times each so I got a good feel for the game . Here I'll detail my thoughts on the game. Also, please find linked some images. Please forgive the poor quality and angles. I'm not entirely sure I was allowed to take photos but others were doing so too, so I did it a bit sneaky like. http://imgur.com/QKcK19r,E2r8POD,sSbQv8J,PvaOp3s,faAYSVz,OGye1kr,EKzzwg5,FwCHIk5,jfkOh4h#0

Firstly, I played as Egypt, as they are the easier team to play. They start fortified on top of a hill, defending, while the Romans must attack up the hill. At their disposal they have burning hay bales to push down the hill towards the attackers, numerous elephants to smash the enemy lines to bits and scythed chariots to cut the Romans down where they stand. But you already knew all this, so I'll delve straight into the nitty gritty.

Controlling your units feels very fluid and responsive. You issue an order and they hop to it; gone are the days in previous games where you'd issue an order just for them to ignore it, it would seem. Animations are nice and look well done (as I'd expect; I learned today Creative Assembly has the largest motion capture studio in Europe!) and the units themselves are very detailed and nice to look at. The environments too are particularly pleasant. Granted it was a desert map and the major feature was sand, but the dunes looked good and there was a lot of picturesque scenery in the background too, including the Pyramids of Giza of course.

The actual fighting was impressive too. Most of the animations and fighting was very enjoyable and worked like a charm, though there were a few issues from time to time. Soldiers would sometimes appear to stab and slash when no one was about. In addition, the actual fighting seems to pass quite quickly. Remember how quickly battles went in the original Rome? My play throughs weren't quite that fast, but still quite speedy. This may have something to do with the fact the Roman army is experienced and heavy infantry against light Egyptian soldiers but I'm not sure; I think the general pace of battles is quicker.

The first person view makes a return for artillery (nothing quite like scoring a bull's eye with a ballista!), but for other units it is replaced by the shaky cam we all seen in the Teutoburg Forest battle. This is actually really cool - I loved getting down on my soldiers' levels and charging with them into battle, or riding with my scythed chariots to cut down the enemy. It's quite immersive.

What I really loved though was the attention to detail and many little features present in the game. Seeing your soldiers raise their shields to block incoming arrows. Watching them jump over the sides of the ship after beaching to join the main army. When tired and stationary, your men will bend over and try to catch their breath back. My favourite moment was seeing my brave unit of Roman men charging uphill with flaming arrows stuck in their shields, with more and more men falling after each volley to get stuck into hand to hand combat. It really seemed like a great game, and one I now look forward to even more.

Of course though, there are some issues. The hay bales I mentioned were a bit buggy and only worked when they wanted to. As previously mentioned also the speed of the battles seemed a bit too quick. Perhaps it was the PC it was running on, but the game itself sometimes seemed a bit laggy. The projectile trails are quite ugly too, particularly for javelins, and look more like a smudge than a sleek javelin flying through the air. Finally, unit sizes just feel too small. I want thousands of men fighting (perhaps this could solve the battle speed), not hundreds. Maybe in the final game we can pick unit sizes and fix this.

Well I hoped you enjoyed the read. In addition CA also did a live code demo on the campaign map, but it was essentially what we've already seen before, with the exact same map zooming across Egypt, Syria, Asia Minor and towards Germania. They did go into a bit more detail about how you deal with other characters and politics. Should someone appear who is a threat to you, you could assassinate or bribe them. On the other hand, a particularly helpful character could be supported or bribed to further support you. Characters will appear over the course of the game, both real and fictional, and will need to be dealt with in one way or another.

If you have any questions feel free to ask. I'll try to answer as best I can.",,False,self,t5_2rq9c,False,,,True,t3_1gx9sd,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1gx9sd/my_experience_of_total_war_rome_ii_at_rezzed_some/,

1343259590.0,81,self.totalwar,x5rib,Why I love the Total War franchise. ,Catmand0,92,11,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/x5rib/why_i_love_the_total_war_franchise/,"I have been a gamer(mainly PC) for the past 15 years and revled in some of the greatest titles and franchises of all time. While I have games I love in all genres(with the exception of sports games), strategy holds the dearest place in my heart. Starting off as a young gamer with my first 4X strategy game, Civilization, and my first RTS, Red Alert and Age of Empires, my love for the genre was cemented. While I still play Civilization's later incarnations and Age of Empires 2(best AoE game ever), one strategy franchise stands out in my mind above all others, and that is Total War. 

I remember the first time I saw Shogun 1 played, it blew my mind. The combination of never before seen large scale battle simulation and the intricate 4x strategy gaming was an enthralling proposition for me and I soon became hooked. It only got better with each successive release, with my personal favorit so far being Rome:TW. 

In the realm of strategy games, no other franchise stands to comparison with Total War. I have played and loved many other strategy titles but only a small select few offer the radical shift in game play mechanics that Total War did and still does. Most other strategy games are just like C&amp;C, AoE or Warcraft, just with a shinier coat of paint on them. While there is nothing wrong with this style of RTS, AoE2 being one of my favorite games of all time, it has gotten old. 

An example of the stagnant nature of most RTSs would be in Star Craft 2. At first I loved it, reveling in my days of yore playing SC1, kicking it with Rynor, Zeratul, and Kerigan again. But as I got into the multiplayer, it dawned on me that the gameplay was just a competition on who can micro manage and build up a large force the fastest. Being good at Star Craft is just a matter of preforming a series of mindless actions more efficiently than the next guy.  As soon as this hit me I lost all intrest in the game, feeling that all the enjoyment I got out of it was some kind of lie.

Total War games on the other hand are different. Instead of a flurry of preplanned efficient actions, one has to use one's brain for more than hitting hot keys. A total war campaign is a complex challenge, balancing economic, military and diplomatic factors to survive and thrive. Unlike most strategy game campaigns the choices you make are open ended and not because some schmuck in a cut scene told you to. The battles make one feel like Julius Caesar or Saladin. Having to make real tactical choices based on a multitude of factors such as cartography, weather and unit mix is a refreshing change from just sending a shit tonne of guys to the enemies base.  

The historical settings of the games also appeal to me. I would call my self a history nerd, with a special love of the classical roman era. My day dreams often fall under the ""If I was (insert historical figure), what would I have done and how it would have been different."" verity.  Total War provides the player with this very ability. 

TLDR:I love Total War because it makes you use your brain and it takes strategy gaming to a whole new level. 

Edit:I used Star Craft as an example for the express propose of watching fan boys get pissed off and fight. Thats some strategy right there. ",,False,self,t5_2rq9c,1343319175.0,,,True,t3_x5rib,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/x5rib/why_i_love_the_total_war_franchise/,

The only reason I bring this up is that I wanted to allow the opportunity to not only welcome any new warlords, but also be able to direct them to the side bar for most F.A.Q. that you may have. Obviously, you may certainly ask questions to the rest of the subreddit and we will gladly try and answer them, however, I have noticed some repeating questions which have gotten an increasingly annoyed response from the subreddit.

I just want to say that if you think your question can be answered by looking at the sidebar, then check there first because it probably can be ;) . If your question seems a bit more complex (i.e. technical issue, glitch, or installation problem [although many mod installation problems can be answered by looking through the guide to R:TW and mods]) then certainly feel free to ask away. However, the best place to check for many technical issues would be on the twcenter.net site or any of the additional total war sites.

Fun stories and After Action Reports (AAR) can be found on twcenter.net as well (here specifically: http://www.twcenter.net/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=1355). I personally have one and I would encourage anyone who enjoys to tell their story of their empire's growth or failure without necessarily wishing to create a video series or playthrough to attempt one of these. They are fun and the crowd over at twcenter are incredibly warm welcoming to any and all tales and new stories. 

There is indeed a Reddit Total War group (or clan I guess) on Steam. The link is also over in the sidebar for any interested in joining it. 

 I believe that as the release of Total War: Rome II edges ever closer, the numbers within this subreddit will continue to climb. As with everything, this means that there must be more attentiveness to quality to continue to have the wondrous subreddit that is /r/totalwar continue to be as fun and insightful to check ~~everyday~~ constantly. Obviously these matters ultimately reside with the mods (our Shogun /u/ajoakim and the honorable rex Brittaniae /u/ryth). My question in regards to them, as well as the rest of the subreddit, is at what number of subscribers should we need to potentially add another mod (not a plug for me, just asking since we are approaching 10,000 subscribers)?

I hope that this was a good way to answer any newcomer's questions or concerns and also provide a small ""townhall"" type discussion on the future of the subreddit and any concerns that current users may have. As always, keep your swords sheathed while inside the halls of /r/totalwar and let's continue to another awesome year with Rome II being released later!

(I know that this post echoed much of what we discussed at the beginning of the year, but noticed that there may have been some newcomers since we had that original discussion)

1367066755.0,76,self.totalwar,1d7or7,The LOTR mod for Rome is well worth checking out!,Cheimon,88,12,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1d7or7/the_lotr_mod_for_rome_is_well_worth_checking_out/,"I'd just like to give a quick heads-up that the Lord of the Rings: Total War mod for RTW is actually pretty good.  As someone who's played both TATW and this, I was struck by how neither was necessarily better.  Despite the praise that's lavished on TATW, this mod does several things better (at least to me), and perhaps this is helped by being set in Rome: Total War.  A quick warning, though: you need the Alexander expansion/DLC to run it, which while a great expansion isn't included in the standard steam RTW Gold edition package that you've probably got.

So what does it do so well?  Here's my list:

* Recruitment isn't limited by time so much as population and buildings.  This makes raising an army less frustrating and also means you can actually use your best units once you've built the stuff needed for them.

* Everywhere is a city, not a castle.  Castles in TATW had an annoying habit of being almost unusable because they never grew.  LOTR TW avoids this, for the most part, which is more fun.

* Retraining your units is a real option, and so is balancing that with your population, in contrast to TATW where you can only retrain by using up a potential unit (so why not just have a new unit?) and your population doesn't go down through recruitment.

* Custom settlements are, as ever, a mixed bunch, and this mod has a habit of disliking gates.  However, a variety of settlement types (from village to city) means that you're not always assaulting a wooden castle and a village.  

* On the battlefield, things still look good: Nazgul can have fell beasts, while mumakil look just like they do in the film.  Goblins are also noticeably better looking, although as ever they lack colour variation.  Trolls do look considerably worse than in TATW, though overall the lack of in-unit diversity (e.g. different hair, etc) doesn't hurt things as much as you'd think.

* Despite being well into a campaign, I've yet to encounter the incredibly boring stack upon stack of enemy troops (often free) that TATW produced.  This makes it more fun.

* Characters won't die outside of battle (helpful for immortal beings) and don't get spammed up with ancillaries, but instead unique characters will simply have unusually useful combinations of starting traits and a few ancillaries.  

* Field battle maps are fantastic: interesting, new, and varied: however, they don't play nicely with fell beasts or mumakil.

* Factions tend to be graphically unified and lack the 'half-done' approach of a few peoples in TATW, like the silvan elves.  However, those factions that are 'done' in TATW tend to look slightly better.

To make sure my argument is balanced, however, I'll include some cons:

* Ents don't work nearly as well.  Trolls look appalling, but I've yet to close into battle with them as elves, I've always shot them down.  But my ents got surrounded and died fast.

* Fell beasts and mumakil have a hard time in forests, as they constantly can't maneuver properly and get shot down.

* While some custom settlements, such as Minas Tirith, work a lot better in the game's constraints, others, such as Moria, do not work well at all.  I suppose that's what you'd expect.

* Traits, while carefully produced and balanced, often lack descriptions, and the grammar for many phrases is poor.  The mod is translated into two languages, which suggests it might not have originally been done in English.  

* Settlements lack the loving descriptions and full analysis of the 'book' building in every TATW settlement.  

* A few armies still spawn, sometimes under siege and sometimes on the field.  This can, of course, be dealt with using console commands mid-campaign.  

* Custom scripts can work awkwardly: for example, when Minas Tirith was under siege, a Rohan army spawned due to the beacons being lit.  Said army then proceeded to ride away from the city to help defend the westfold from dunlendings.

* Eriador lacks a properly fleshed out faction, and is mostly peasant militias.  However, there are the dunlendings and a separation between silvan and galadhrim elves, which is lacking in TATW.

* In an effort to force the player to fight for the good of middle earth, Mordor is made particularly powerful.  While pleasing in concept, this results in a lot of Mordor's units essentially being as good as Saruman's.  Sometimes with better armour.

* 'Good' and 'Bad' are still as utterly black and white as in TATW, which works awkwardly for a total war game.  Still, that can be forgiven due to the strength of this difference visually in the films.  

* Gandalf is just a diplomat, and cannot be a fighting unit.  ",,False,self,t5_2rq9c,False,,med2g,True,t3_1d7or7,http://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1d7or7/the_lotr_mod_for_rome_is_well_worth_checking_out/,
