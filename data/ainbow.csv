The people standing in the queue were not impressed - but in true moron style, Mr Queue-Jump hurls back some homophobic trash at one of the people stood there.

He closes the door, turns to me, and tries to get me on side. I expect he presumed I would agree with him - that ""those gays shouldn't even be out, they should be up at that poncey bar on the other side of town"".

Nope.

*""You'll need to get out now""*

""Mate, just drive, who cares about the queue?""

*""I'll drive when you take back what you've said just now""*

""What are you on about mate?""

*""I'm not your mate,  I don't associate myself with vermin like you. Take back what you said about gay people, now, and apologize to them""*

He realises what's going on and is not very impressed, starts to get aggro.

*""Before you start with me, I'm gay, so perhaps next time you should hold your mouth before you make stupid comments infront of strangers?""*

""So you're a fuckin' poof as well then - fucking shit-eating cunt!""

*""Get out.""*

Before he got a chance to reach over to me (we don't have assault screens here), I got out of the car. With a Mag 6D in one hand I opened his door and dragged him out and threw him to the pavement - infront of the crowd who are waiting for a cab.

By this point, other taxi drivers had arrived to see what the commotion is.

Mr Queue-Jump squares up to me - but then notices the 6 or 7 people stood behind me. I'm friends with most drivers and they all know I'm gay, and heard what was going on.

He decided better of it and walked away. I saw him walking home along the main road no fewer than 6 times, he must have been walking home for hours. Not a single cab driver would pick him up.

**tl;dr: I'm a taxi driver, someone was hurling around homophobic abuse, didn't reckon on me being gay, and all the other drivers being supportive. He walked home for hours in the rain.**

Please consider taking a moment to support the /r/gaymers community in this.",Jess_than_three,651,119,200,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/zn0ou/rgaymers_has_received_through_the_reddit_admins_a/,"[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/zmrfh/gaymers_could_be_banned_and_deleted_by_tomorrow/) are two [threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/zms9y/rgaymers_may_be_banned_as_early_as_monday_morning/) on the subject, but the really short version of the story is this: Notwithstanding that the term ""gaymer"" dates back a decade and a half, and notwithstanding that the owner of gaymer.org registered that trademark five years ago and hasn't taken issue with this in the last year and eight months, he has chosen to demand that the /r/gaymers subreddit - which is completely unconnected to that website - be taken down. This is pretty ridiculous for a number of reasons, and I think it's worth supporting their community in this.

I need to stop for a second to point out that [the admins have no intention of banning the /r/gaymers subreddit outright](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/zmrfh/gaymers_could_be_banned_and_deleted_by_tomorrow/c65z162) - however, they **may** be forced into renaming it. Aside from the inconvenience and the absurdity of it, this is hugely problematic because ""gaymer"" is a clever descriptive term that has existed since long before that website was created - it isn't a product, nor is it a service; and if /r/gaymers can't use the term, then by extension *nobody* can use it. And that's not okay. It's also not okay, at least in my opinion, for the owner of gaymers.org to try to bully other people like this.

Obviously any sort of witch-hunt is unacceptable. But what we can do, and what I think it would be reasonable to do, is to take just a minute or two to send an email to the owner of gaymer.org (if you can find it; this does qualify as personal information and shouldn't be shared here), or to post on their forums in support of /r/gaymers. You might also send a quick email to [the EFF](https://www.eff.org/about/contact) asking if they can help. The reddit admins are already aware of the situation and are basically on the community's side on this, so it isn't necessary to contact them.

Thanks, and sorry for the interruption. We will now resume ainbow's regularly scheduled program of being awesome.

**UPDATES**

Read [the official response from gaymer.org owner Chris Vizzini](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaymers/comments/znqsd/regarding_reddit_cease_and_desist_from_gaymerorg/) - who should really know better than to start a land war on Reddit, and whose dogged persistence in attacking a community that isn't really harming his site, and which is made up of people who are ultimately *on his side*, is truly inconceivable.

Also, you might be interested in [this massive thread in AskReddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/zmukv/a_large_gay_community_of_reddit_is_about_to_be/) (removed because it was ultimately soliciting legal advice), with an outpouring of support from the reddit community.

I believed this until I found him on facebook about a year ago. We started talking. As it turns out, he came out as gay and my family decided to pretend that he was dead. My family's reaction wasn't as much of a shock as it would have been for most people, since I've been avoiding coming out of the closet because I'm afraid of that exact reaction. 

When I found out that he was coming to visit my state, meeting up was a no-brainer. We hugged and cried and talked about everything that had happened in the last 15 years. He's an amazing person. He's traveled all over the world and is now getting his Master's in psychology, all completely on his own. 

I wanted to tell him that I'm gay, too, but I couldn't work up the courage. I still can't say it out loud. He'd ask me which celebrities I thought were cute, naming the men he liked and asking me if I thought the same. While I wanted to say, ""actually, I like Janelle Monae,"" all I could do was laugh nervously and change the subject. 

But even if I couldn't admit it this time, I'm happy with how things turned out. Meeting him made the fact that there's life after getting disowned real to me. Whenever I'd read stories of people who lost their families and were able to move on, I'd think, ""That's nice for them, but my family's worse than that..."" But now there's a real, live person who not only survived, but *flourished.* My cousin is cool as fuck.

Well, I'm here now and I hope this community isn't like some people in r/LGBT.

Not to mention, my first message from a mod simply called me a ""bad ally"" and said ""no cookie for me"". The one I actually talked to replied to one of my messages saying respect should go both ways with ""a bloo bloo"" before ranting about how I'm horrible and part of the problem.

We have all sorts of designs from dragons to tigers to princess crowns. I am faced with parents roping their children into only getting designs that fit their child's gender everyday. 

""Don't get the Unicorn, that's for girls."" or ""Don't get the spider that's for boys.""

Well yesterday, a little boy who couldn't have been more than 6 or 7 years old came up to our stand and clearly stated, ""I want the princess crown"". Now the staff is very liberal and will paint whatever you want, as long as the parents will pay so we waited for the mother's responses to this request (in my mind sadly expecting her to veer his course to a different design). She said, ""is that what you want? Alright let's do it!"" I was overjoyed. 

While my coworker painted his face with pinks, purples, and whites, I chatted with the mother. I told her that I really appreciated her letting him get that with no qualms, and I was impressed by how little he had worried about the normally gendered design. 

She said, ""Oh he knows gender is just a social construct."" I laughed out of shear joy in meeting someone who not only believed this but had also effectively raised their child to act within that belief system.

I told the customer she had been my favorite all day and would have given her a discount if I could. 

I don't know if this woman was straight or queer (she was with another woman who didn't seem to have any children with her) but it was a very exciting experience to see gender norms thwarted out in the real world so matter-of-factly.

(Upvote for awareness please.)",,496,60,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/y4yz6/my_tiny_little_slightly_redneck_southern_alberta/,"Hi everyone. This is my first post on r/ainbow but I decided to come out of lurking in my dark corner for this. My small city in Alberta Canada (couple hours up from the Montana border) is having our first ever pride festival. [Here](http://www.medicinehatnews.com/front-page-news/hatter-organizing-first-ever-gay-pride-event-07142012.html) is the link to the news article that was published a little while ago.

Here's the thing I'm most worried about. Medicine Hat, AB is decades behind in the LGBTQ rights movement and I know there are going to be haters... There will always be haters, we're used to it being in what is basically Canada's bible belt. I plan to show up with bells on ready for an awesome time, but the gay community in this city (because very few of us are actually out and proud) is really disconnected from eachother and I fear a crumby turnout due to, well, fear. It's often joked about every time someone has started to get a pride parade together in the past that it's just ""the rednecks trying to line us all up single file so they can bust out the hunting rifles."" It's a funny joke, but it's very honestly based in truth. There are still people here who have beaten people to death or close to it based on race so sexual orientation is another ball game completely and it breaks my heart.

So here's what I'm asking r/ainbow. If there are enough of us, they can't take us all down. I want a huge turnout from as many places as possible. I'm not directly involved in the event but they have a Facebook page under ""Medicine Hat Pride"" and from what I know the set date is September 22nd in Memorial Park downtown. I would love to see people from all corners of the Earth flood our little city and show people that there's no more room for hate. Even if you could just like the Facebook page to show that one more person gives a damn I would be eternally grateful.",,False,,t5_2tcpq,False,,,True,t3_y4yz6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/y4yz6/my_tiny_little_slightly_redneck_southern_alberta/,

But, as amazing a time I had, I also had it brought down by ALOT of very inappropriate moments throughout the parade and festival. I was wearing a leather harness and jock brief [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/u8n5tTS) and had, on multiple occasions people grab my ass, fondle my junk, or some other inappropriate gesture.

I'm not going to pretend like I don't appreciate comments about my outfit or that ""I have a nice ass"" or things like that. But coming up to me and grabbing my crotch, pulling my harness, or things of that nature are just not ok. And the depressing thing is you'd think at least the women wouldn't be mindful of something like that, but I had people of all genders doing things like this. I don't mind a playful slap on the ass, or a tug on my harness from people I know or am interested in. But getting my dick grabbed by total strangers and then asking to take a picture makes you a creep factor 10.

So unless you explicitly have consent from someone to touch them in such a manner, keep your hands to yourself. It's ok to look (within reason), as many guys, that I know of, who dress like that for parades are doing it for the freedom and attention.

I waited outside, holding the rest of her stuff, browsing reddit on my phone (what else?), when two guys approached me. They stared at me for a few minutes, obviously talking about me. I didn't give a shit because, well, why should I? 

All of a sudden, one of them comes up to me real close and asks ""What are you supposed to be?"". I didn't answer, I just had a 'WTF?' kind of look on my face. So he continues. ""Didn't you hear me? What are you supposed to be? Why are you wearing that? Do you think you're a man or what?"". I was wearing my jeans jacket with all the patches of my favourite bands on it, like I do most of the time. Nothing unusual for me. 

I was in the middle of ""Fuck off, you ass-faced piece of shit."" when my 15 year old sister stepped out of the changing room, looked the guy (who was probably around 18) dead in the eyes and said ""This is my sister. She is a woman. She likes boys and girls. She dresses however she wants. And if you say one more word to her that isn't 'Sorry', I'm going to rip off your tiny balls and fucking force feed them to you, you dickface. And now, I kindly ask you to PISS OFF!""

I was laughing like and idiot and high-fiving my sister while the two idiots walked away, confused and grumbling. But this wasn't even the best part. While we were still standing there, two girls who were about my sister's age came up to us. They had heard the whole thing and one of them asked ""I heard you like boys AND girls? Do you like these pants on me? Do I look good in them?"". I was confused and just said something like ""Yeah, sure, you look fine."". 

And before I knew it, a bunch of teenage girls were running around me, asking me if their skirts made their asses look fat, how I liked their shirts and pants, if I thought they were cute and one of them even gave me her phone number. I'd never call her, because she was about 16, but still -&gt; [THIS!](http://www.quickmeme.com/meme/3pzfh6/) And looking doesn't hurt anyone, right? ;-)

If this doesn't really belong, feel free to remove.  
  
I'm a 25 y/o gay man.  I first figured it out the summer between 5th and 6th grade.  From like 4th grade until the end of middle school I had always been somewhat bullied.  Other boys would push me, and call me gay and throw stuff.  I don't know if they actually knew I was gay, but it hurt the same.  I never told my parents or teachers because I was worried if my parents found out, they would then find out I was gay and I didn't feel ready for that.  Around December of 6th grade my parents bough us a dog.  A Dauchshund named Madeline.  She was 1 year old and slept in my bed every night.  
  
After a couple weeks, I started talking to Madeline at night.  I knew she didn't understand me or anything, but it was kind of a relief.  Like a living diary.  I told her I was gay (first time I ever vocalized it), how I was afraid of the future and what people would think of me.  I told her I still wanted a family even though it seemed like people wouldn't let me.  I told her everything, and the fact that she was there and still played with me made me feel better.  There's something immensely satisfying about just saying the things you feel worried about.  
  
Like I said, I'm 25 now.  I have a good job, good apartment and wonderful boyfriend.  My mom just called and said they have to put Madeline down.  Madeline is someone who really helped me grow up.  I feel like a real member of my family is dieing tonight.  We're about to drive back home to see her again, and I just feel so sad.

This really, really bothers me. In fact, it scares me.

Why? Because the fight for equality is *so far* from over. The decision the Supreme Court is talking about is just the tip of the iceberg. It's AWESOME that such a monumental decision for gay and lesbian rights is being made this week, and wider acceptance means that the door will be opened for acceptance of other gender and sexual minority identities.

But we still have so much to do. These are a few things I can think of off the top of my head:

• Full acceptance and support for trans- people (including healthcare which supports SRS, hormones, etc.) especially trans- people of color.  
• [Legal recognition of non-binary gender identities](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/recognize-non-binary-genders/80HYg71P) (ex: allowing people to put X as their gender on passports and stuff).  
• Further acceptance and knowledge of various other less well-known identities such as asexuality, non-binary genders, and even bisexuality, which people somehow still manage to get confused by.    
• Making sure that gender identity and *expression* is a category legally protected from discrimination.

Not to mention that it's problematic that gay marriage is easy to sell because it's largely portrayed as attractive, affluent, white, cis males trying to conform to society's standards of living. [This article](http://www.changelabinfo.com/2013/03/25/why-i-support-same-sex-marriage-as-a-civil-right-but-not-as-a-strategy-to-achieve-structural-change/) describes some of my points (though I don't agree with all of it).

Anyway, whether you fully agree with me or not, I just really wanted to address the ""fight is almost over"" type comments I've been seeing. This is a dangerous line of thinking and it's frustrating to see it coming from people on our side. I would strongly encourage you to gently call people out if you see them making comments like that.

I was hitting the random button a little bit and stumbled on this cool sub.  After browsing through some /top posts I decided to share a cool story from college. 

I went to Guilford College in North Carolina which, coming from a small town in the north, was miles ahead in terms of social acceptance and incorporation of everyone, especially regarding sexuality.  I was at one of many bon-fires in the woods behind the school, where people were socializing.  Suddenly, a fairly inebriated individual stands up and addresses the bonfire (it was smallish, like 40 people).  He starts rambling about how he came to visit the school and might attend in the fall and that he loved everything about the school.  At this point his friend makes some light-hearted comment about him being drunk, suggesting he should sit down.  He responds by saying, ""Oh quit being such a fag"".

What followed was the first time I have seen not only members of the lgbtq community, but also their allies, shut down this speech.  Like a cacophony this great ""Whoooooaaaaahhhhh!""  ""Hey hey hey!!!"" ""Not cool man!"" chorus rose up and it seemed to physically stun the kid for a second.  The coolest part was what happened next.

The kid stuttered out an apology (it was probably overwhelming having that many people suddenly oppose something you just said), and then someone stood up and calmly said, ""Don't worry about it man, that kind of speech just isn't cool here"".  And that was the end of it.  I saw the kid over the rest of the night just kind of relax and be incorporated into conversations around him.

The thing that made it so cool for me wasn't just the solidarity of the community in shooting down ""fag speech"", but that they were alternatively firm, and then understanding and empathetic.  Rather than push him outside the community, he was told what would and wouldn't be tolerated, but that he was welcome to join us if he respected everyone there.  I've always felt like that's the only way to change minds; with empathy.

TLDR: Guy gets shut down when he calls someone a fag by like 40 people but they do it the right way.

**Edit: airmandan pointed out that drunk people don't talk the way this guy (the calm guy) did, I should have been clearer that I was paraphrasing his speech (I had been drinking so his exact words escape me, but they were to that effect).  Whether you believe the story or not, it's all good.  My real point in posting it was pointing out that handling situations like this with empathy is more effective than responding negatively**",,False,,t5_2tcpq,1360716993.0,,,True,t3_18czk6,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/18czk6/shooting_down_the_fag/,

Everything has gone to hell... :( - please help..,AnelkaWBA,412,51,191,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/1kaaoj/im_in_high_school_and_my_exboyfriend_just_outed/,"We're both 16, and I broke up with him because he was always cheating on me with girls at parties but he says I'm being unfair because he's bi and is attracted to both so he is more inclined to have sex with girls because I can't be both. 

I'm closeted, kind of a jock (soccer is a sport too!) so I felt so lucky when I met him online at a gay teen website, we started dating and spent every day together basically pretending to be best friends. We had been dating for 4 months when another friend told me about him and my boyfriend (he didn't know that) had slept with the same girl during the same party. 

I was upset but forgave him when he promised not to do it again. Last week I found out he didn't stop and has had sex with at least four other girls, that hurt. 

He got so angry when I said it was over and told everyone that I was gay and that I wouldn't stop hitting on him, Some of my soccer teammates called me faggot and locked me out of the showers while they were in there, my coach gave them a piece of his mind which was nice of him. I walked home basically crying and found my parents sitting at the kitchen table waiting for me.

My mom started crying after I told my dad I actually was gay, I'm an only child and my mom wants grandkids apparently, I told her I was going to have kids but she says it's not the right lifestyle for me but my dad wasn't happy with that and told me they would support me in whatever I would do.

My facebook is filled with questions and comments, pretty completely divided in supportive and unsupportive, I don't live in the most accepting place so I guess  I should be thankful.

any advice would be accepted.

I don't know if it is because I was brought on at the wrong time or what but, I don't agree with the way things are being done in /r/transgender. While most of them are amazing people, there are things I cannot stand by when it comes to how that place is being run.

Being let behind the scenes really opened my eyes. However, I no longer feel that I can be part of the mod team. Will I continue to be part of /r/transgender? Who knows. I'll probably be banned after this. I'm on verge of tears over this but I feel it is for the best right now.

I will let you guys decide for yourselves how you feel at this point but, this is what happens behind the scenes. The things in red are deleted comments/posts. While some of them I am totally in support of being deleted, there are others I cannot. Also, the rest are mod notes.

It is definitely making the sting of having to leave /r/transgender so much easier. I'm not gonna lie, when I posted this here I expected negativity, outcry, etc. I've received the opposite, tenfold.

I had moved away from the LGBT scene for quite some time, but I'm at a point in my life where I'd like to share my journey and experiences. I felt there was one side of the story being told from people who are ex-trans, the few who speak up about their experience seem to be either religious converts or just wildly critical of trans identities. I also think that many trans people can be nervous of those who revert to their birth sex. So I think posting this might be a very valuable insight.

My story is a bit typical, I was a fat, lazy and extremely depressed teenager, thought about suicide constantly and I really hated myself, zero confidence, very few friends and the only thing I had any interest in was world of warcraft. I remember I felt very dysphoric about my body since the start of puberty, I had been a happy outgoing child but with then the reality of becoming a man dawning, I became withdrawn. I was maybe 18/19 when I really became aware of transgender people and the possibility of transitioning, and seeing people's timelines and youtube videos.

I felt very, very ugly and unattractive in myself at the time, and I thought if those people could do it, then so could I. I really picked myself up, lost weight, then started to see a therapist and after a few months (but it felt like ages at the time) got hormones. By the time I was 21, I had been on hormones a year and felt great about myself, so much more confident and outgoing. Had a boyfriend for a while too who was great but drifted apart.

When I was 22 I started to feel that I had gone a bit overboard with all the girly stuff, too much pink and short dresses and just felt it wasn't me. I started wearing jeans and hoodies, then I cut my hair short and had a bit of a butch phase for a while. But it got me wondering, how far back into the male side of things could I go without feeling uncomfortable again? So I started to test myself, see how far I could push myself before hitting that wall. I never hit it. I wasn't uncomfortable with having a woman's body, that wasn't ever the motivation for reverting.

It was just before my 23rd birthday I stopped hormones completely. It was a bit ruff at first, had some mood swings and felt strange, but a few months later I was feeling good. I started really hitting the gym, because I was pretty skinny and the extra muscle helped people identify me as a man. I've spent the last year now living as a fairly androgenous/femme man, and things have been really good. I've moved to a new city, got a great circle of friends and a really good life.

Normally I only told close friends and partners about my past, and they have asked me what made me regret changing, or variations on that, but I honestly don't regret a thing. At first I felt very guarded about transitioning, but it was a big step on the way to me truly feeling comfortable with myself and really finding out who I am, it was a positive thing, and I wouldn't trade those years for the world.

So, if you've ever wanted to ask someone like me something, go right ahead! Ask me absolutely anything!

**That's all for now folks! Been at this a few hours, but I'm exhausted. So I'll have to pick this up at another time.**

**Edit 2. I see we've been linked to by trolls and there's more than a few posters using this thread to push an anti-trans agenda, which is not something I wanted. I'm going to wrap this up soon, so if you've any more questions, then get asking. I'll return later on for another round of questions. Thanks to everyone who's posted genuine questions and I'm just so happy at all the positive responses to this, it made it so worthwhile. Thank you.**

The reason I'm posting this is because Christmas day 2010 was I decided to change my life, this was after several weeks of contemplating suicide and crying myself to sleep. I can't remember where I read it or who wrote it, but someone posted a letter for people feeling suicidal that said something along the lines of *""If you're going to commit suicide...at least* ***try*** *to live the life you want to live before ending it.""*  
  
So I did. From that day on, I got a calendar and used Jerry Seinfeld's ""Don't break the chain"" idea, and every day I promised myself to take a step, even baby steps, in the right direction.  
  
Within those 2 years I landed a job (which after meeting many people, landed a better and AMAZING job), lost 150lbs, made a bunch of amazing friends that act as if we've known eachother since high school, and have a boyfriend that is literally a '10', who looks like one of the guys I would look at when living at home at 24 &amp; think that a guy so gorgeous is ""out of my league"" and too good for me, to which would only make me cry considering I had never had someone in my life.

my wife told me that she loves me, whatever i am, told me that its important that i dont feel depressed anymore or be plagued by suicidal thoughts. she said that she wasnt very surprised, but was not aware of the sheer amount of misery it had been causing me. i cried and wept like a baby about how i always feel different and about how i *look* different and i feel different about looking different. 

I am a man, but since i was a teenager i have 'suffered' from gynecomastia - i have breasts. i have hated them and loved them for all my life, i have been ashamed of them and embarrassed by them but they have been a huge part of my sexual identity and sexuality. My wife has always encouraged me to take my shirt off at the beach and not be embarrassed. but it wasnt just having breasts that bothered me... they were my private sexual parts, just like my wife's are private to her. 

anyway, my wife has applauded me removing my chest hair and understands them to be feminine breasts. she has always paid attention to them... but has a new understanding of exactly how i feel about them. well - today she bought me my first bra and i'm wearing it right now, under my t-shirt while i type this. I'm sitting on the couch with my kids watching gumby and i am so comfortable. 

my wife is my hero. 


Edit: Thanks everyone! I'll be passing all your compliments along to the Mrs. You can consider all hugs and kisses sent! Also, **Gumby** DVDs are on Amazon pretty cheap! 

I'm feeling exponentially better all the time! I want to learn to shed my defensive postures, defensive points of view and defensive words. I want to stop slouching, stop crossing my arms and stop feeling like every time someone is laughing that they're laughing at me.

&gt;Tangentially related gripe: I've contacted them several times over the years about moving ""Gay and Lesbian Culture"" content out of the ""Adult Interests"" 18+ section ([otherwise reserved for porn, lingerie, and sex toys](http://www.stumbleupon.com/discover/interests/category/Adult)). I tried to explain that there's so much more to ""gay culture"" that is certainly appropriate for children under the age of eighteen; at the very least, it's no more ""inappropriate"" than other ""safe for all ages"" topics, like [Babes](http://www.stumbleupon.com/interest/Babes). 

&gt;Never got a response. So while important topics such as ""feminism"" and ""African Americans"" are (rightly) found in the Society Interests section and--crucially--available by default for Stumble users under the age of 18, ""gay culture"" (which includes things like, ya know, the whole struggle-for-equal-rights thing) is classified as a separate, ""Adult"" Interest. 

Just wondering what other people's thoughts are. Perhaps someone who works in software/online development of this sort could shed some light on why StumbleUpon might have chosen to categorize ""LGBT interests"" in this way.

After freaking out about her lack of a response, and an update on a particular topic mentioned (unrelated) that I figured would be better said via person.

I just got off the phone with her, and I am still shaking. I asked her if she got my email, and apparently she hadn't checked her email at all since she sent me one on Sunday asking about the party. I decided I had to come clean right there before she read it.

Her response to me telling her was this:

""Ok then. Doesn't change anything with me.""

HOLY FUCKING SHIT!! Here I was freaking out that she would absolutely flip! And she had the nerve to tell me it was ""ok!"" I was curled up in a ball sitting in front of my computer, preparing myself for if I wanted to start crying, and she just says ""ok then."" I tell her I've been wanting to do it for a while and that I finally built up the courage to do so, and she has the fucking nerve to say without changing her expression, ""ok then.""

I'm still shaking, still a nervous wreck, and still freaking over those words: ""ok then.""

5 years of dread and worry and heartbreak finally ended with a simple ""ok then."" She seemed more concerned about what the rest of the content of the email was and seemed to shake off everything else. The only other thing she asked was if I met someone. I said no, but that's not entirely true (I'm not dating ""per se,"" but there are two guys I'm kind of interested in).

I suddenly feel 10 pounds lighter, 20˚ cooler (it's 95˚ right now, and for some reason this is helping me cool down), and a lot more true to myself.

After feeling depressed about it for two days, I finally feel some relief. I cannot believe how fucking good this feels. I've told people I don't know I'm gay without batting an eyelash, even some of my best friends, but know I feel I can finally tell my whole family (well, at least my mom's side).

As I finish typing this after 10 minutes, I am no longer shaking, and can literally feel myself cooling down. This is an awesome feeling and I just need to vent it.

Thank you

tl;dr Told mom I'm gay. Response: ""Ok then.""

Update: She just called again. This time laughing. ""I'm sorry if I seemed a bit cold earlier, but I was freaking out thinking your car got stolen or something like that, but it turns out you're just gay. Talk to you later."" (not in so many words, but practically this).

This one might be worse than the last one. Citizens who actually care about the well being about other human beings actually reported to the police that serious shit would go down, aledgedly some of them prepared Molotov coctails, though this is unknown and unreliable.

I'm angry. I saw the polyamory thread and I found the comments unbelievable, to the point where I didn't comment because I didn't even know what to say. Then a couple of days later I saw the demisexuality thread, and I have to say, as someone who is demisexual, that was a pretty unpleasant experience. I was previously fortunate enough to have never really seen hate directed at demisexual people, mainly because most people who have even been exposed to the concept tend to belong to communities that respect diverse identities. I thought /r/ainbow was that kind of community, but maybe I was wrong.

I'm worried that /r/ainbow changing from a place where the diversity of people's identities and experiences is (usually) respected, to a place where members of more established minority groups come to shit on less established minority groups. I'm worried that when people see that /r/ainbow is ""a free area,"" they think it means ""a place where I can go and say nasty, offensive shit about groups I don't like and get congratulated for it.""

Thursday afternoon I was out, presenting en femme and taking the bus to my trans support group meeting. My facial structure, beard shadow and limited skills with makeup make it difficult to assimilate as a woman to cis standards but most of the time people are courteous and respectful or at least just leave me alone. At one of my stops I was standing to the side of the structure where the bench is because I was smoking and I don't like my smoke to bother other people. My bus pulled up and the door opened, I went to get on but there was a bike leaning against the side of the structure in my way. I started to walk around it but one of two guys who was sitting at the stop got up to move the bike, saying ""Sorry, ma'am"", I replied ""No worries, thank you!"" As I was stepping on the the bus the other guy yelled really loudly ""Dude, that's a guy!"" and I just wanted to cry. I didn't look at him or react in any way, I was feeling more self conscious and defeated than angry.

When the guy yelled that the bus driver stared at me with a look of mild disgust on her face and she seemed unduly irritated that I had to dig through my purse for a few seconds to find another quarter for a transfer. When I dropped the coin into the receptacle she yanked the transfer slip off the pad and shoved it into my hand then waited for me to start walking to my seat before she accelerated very quickly and I didn't have time to get my balance before I stumbled, awkwardly.

The only seat available was on a bench of four seats between 2 other people, one of whom took up 2 seats. When I sat down, the woman who took up 2 seats started laughing as if at something hilarious. I don't know if she was laughing at me but it felt like it. I felt like every eye on the bus was looking at me, judging me for being a freak. I just tried to make myself as small as possible to try to avoid notice and died a little inside. Once she started, she didn't stop laughing, giggling, chuckling, even quietly.

I don't know if anyone other than that guy who yelled really saw me as something of an oddity but that just set the tone for how I felt during the rest of my trip. At one point I was feeling so horrible I almost decided to just get off at the next stop and take the next bus home and get drunk. The only thing that stopped me was the thought that I'd have to face the same feelings of standing out as a freak to be ridiculed no matter which way I went. So instead I decided...

**FUCK THEM! They don't get to win.**

I'm glad I didn't go home. The meeting was great! We discussed  a wide range of topics, shared some stories, talked about insecurities, voice (one woman who was there just once before she moves out of town is good friends with CandyFLA, the woman behind the ""finding your female voice"" videos on YT). One pre-everything woman who feels her non-trans related challenges make transition an insurmountable challenge said she was considering reparative therapy because she'd heard good things about it... I felt really bad for her because I can't really do anything for her other than be a good friend but towards the end of the meeting several women further on in transition talked to her and eased some of her worries.

One of the newer members of the group told me she thought, when she first saw me, I'd already been on hormones for a while, so that made me feel good because I'm not, yet. I told my friend (the one who who made me over for Pride a few weeks ago) I was planning to order spiro and estrogen online when I get back from my trip to Cleveland because right now I'm saving up for that trip, she said when I get back she'll introduce me to her doctor who charges on a sliding scale for blood work and a 3 month supply of HRT, so YAY! After the meeting I went out to a couple of bars and karaoke with 3 of the other ladies and one of their partners who is androgynous, doesn't identify as either male or female but prefers masculine pronouns and calls himself a gender nihilist. It was the most fun I've had in a long time and by the time I got home (about 3:30 AM) I'd gotten over the horrible bus trip. :)

The vote on the marriage amendment that will write the one-man-one-woman marriage definition into the state constitution will be cast on Tuesday.  While there is already a significant amount of tension about whether the amendment will pass, I have been worried about the retaliation or celebration from homophobes in my town.  After all, incidences of hate crimes tend to increase around the time of changes in gay rights legislation.  I have already been targeted in my community, and I'm afraid hostilities toward queer folk like me will intensify in the coming days.

When I aired these concerns among my (straight) friends, though, I was caught completely off-guard.  They said that they would arrange shifts to walk me with me to campus.  They said that they'd do their best to be with me 24/7.  They joked that they would buy us all guns and take the fight to the homophobes.  They told me that they would protect me, that they won't let anything happen to me.

While this behavior seems a bit supererogatory (I really don't expect anything bad to happen to me), I was utterly taken aback by what they said.  I've never been so touched in my life.

I just wanted to share.  I'm so beyond elated to have people like this in my life.

Reddit, how should I handle this?](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/w6ivc/my_father_and_i_went_from_discussing_politics_to/). 

The TL;DR of that post is that I sent my father some links providing some information he wanted to know and rather than addressing the content of those links he attacked me personally. 
______________________________

Anyway, recently I've been getting links to the ""Health risks"" portion of the ""Anal sex"" Wikipedia page and now I got a link from http://samesexattraction.org/what-same-sex-attraction.htm. 

Along with these links I received a message (from my mother):

&gt; “Please read every word. This reflects how I think you got where you are. And why you need to talk to a counselor to better understand the path you are on. I love you more than you will ever know.”

Reading these things make me so relieved that I didn't come out to my parents earlier and that they never found me out, there's no telling how awful my life could have been if I hadn't lived in secrecy. In my most recent talk with my father I actually asked him what the links I sent him had to do with me being gay, and why he reacted in the way that he did. He told me that those verifiable points, my homosexuality, my political and philosophical views are all a result of my ""fucked up thinking"" and that they're all related somehow. Furthermore, when I brought it up he started claiming that I had an ""unhealthy obsession"" with this event that happened ""6 months ago"" (it was 3 months ago) and that me not ignoring it was a sign of me being OCD. wow.

Anyway, I'm heavily considering simply cutting my ties with my family more so than ever before.

Since my parents divorced when I was only 2, I know my father felt that he wasn't as significant of an influence in my life as he hoped to be. Thing is, to the contrary, he was the biggest influence on my young life. He is the sole reason I have an insatiable craving for knowledge. He bought a chemistry set for me when I was 12, and the super deluxe RadioShack electronics kit when I was 14. He spent hours with me, helping me learn from both kits. He also took an *entire summer* off from work just so he could take me out to Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and Yosemite. He was, and is, an amazing man. I have told him on several occasions he was and is my hero, but I was still afraid to tell him I'm gay until today.

So, all tolled, today is a good day… no, actually, today is an **amazing** day. It's so wonderful to be loved, and I am proud to be the child of my parents.

My parents initial acceptance of me being gay was apparently due to them having the idea it was a ""phase"". When I brought home a boyfriend I guess it sunk in that it wasn't. So, yesterday I get a phone call from my Dad informing me that he'd no longer pay for my tuition and rent. After a shouting match, which I'm sure we both feel like we won, he just hung up. Climactic ending there, I know. 
So now I have a week to come up with some rent and I need advice on where to look for short term work. I already have ads up on Craigslist, but every other site I find seems to be geared towards finding permanent employment. (Side Note; I already have a job which I just jumped up to full time at. But this won't cover my immediate needs). 

So I guess my questions are these,
Where would I put up more ads for helping people with whatever they need (yard work, physical labor, tutoring (I also have posted on my schools internet bulletin for tutoring services), etc.)? 
Have any of you gone through similar experiences and how did you get through them? 
Are payday advances a good idea for the short term?
Any advice on where to look further for ""help wanted"" type of things?

tl;dr
My parents are jackalopes and I need to find work quickly, where do I look?


UPDATE;
Thank you everyone for the outpouring of advice. I wasn't really expecting this to take off the way it did, and I'm really speechless at how much concern you'e shown for a random stranger. So, anyway on to the update. I've talked to my schools tutoring center and secured a few hours every week working in that office on top of my regular job (also for the university) as well as being put into the tutoring pool. My lovely sister is also helping me pay for food in the short term, and my bank has agreed to a short term loan at a student rate, and I've opened a line of credit with them. It won't be pretty but I think I'm ganna make it. I'm alot calmer than at the time of the original post and no longer thinking of fleeing the country (a joke, of course). Unfortunately, the local LGBT office is closed on Sundays and I'll have to wait to speak to them. Again, thank you everyone. I'd have had no idea where to turn if it wasn't for all of you.

Thanks for talking with me about this everyone!  I got a new perspective on things, and I think its good to be a little more tolerant of people who talk about how accepting they are all the time.  I do want to clarify that I don't hate straight people, ""breeders"", or want straight free zones.  I was expressing a rant in probably the wrong tone and the wrong words and I apologize if I offended anyone.  That was never my intention.  

Let me just start by saying that a person's sexuality doesn't matter to me.  I love all people.  The two ladies that are almost sisters to me are both straight.  Sometimes though, I need to not be ""GAY"". I don't mean I want to be straight.  I mean I want my sexuality to not matter.

So a group of us lesbos have a game night once a month at someone's house so its kid friendly.  We talk about work, the kids, current issues in the news, or the plantation we are going to build on a private island as soon as one of us wins the lottery.  You know, normal stuff.  The one thing that doesn't really ever come up is sexuality.  Gay issues only ever crop up if its in the news.  Its not something that NEEDS to be discussed every fucking minute of my life.  

This past weekend, one of the couples invited a straight couple and their two boys, cause they were friends with the couple and the boys were friends with their son.  We were playing Cards Against Humanity and when you are playing that game the more the merrier.  So we were all like hell ya, invite them over.

All fucking night we got to hear about how much they love the gays, how they taught their kids from a young age that gay was ok.  Dude, you got invited to a party full of lesbos, we already know you are cool or we wouldn't have invited you.  SHUT THE HELL UP!  My life does not revolve around my sexuality!

It happens at work, it happens when I meet new people, it happens when my straight friends meet new gay people.  FOR FUCKS SAKE!  Just treat me like a normal god damn person.  That is how I will know that you are cool.  You don't need to bring up my sexuality, or your thoughts on sexuality as a whole.  It just doesn't need to happen.  I don't stand around talking about how much I love straight people and how I teach my kids that its ok if someone has a mommy and daddy and we shouldn't treat them any different.

I'm sorry I'm ranting, I'm just so sick of it.  I love you r/ainbow, remember to treat your friends like entire human beings, not partial human beings.

When I went back last Christmas I didn't take the meds with me for fear of them finding out. The entire trip was kind of awkward with my parents due to the straining our relationship was going though, but I enjoyed seeing them and being home. 

Over the course of the next few months, I got really depressed trying to figure out what the hell I was doing with my life and stopped HRT all together because I didn't want to change physically and have to reconcile the fact that I hadn't brought my parents into the loop. I fully expected them to come around eventually at this point. During this time I lost a really close relationship I had with a friend out here mostly because I was a depressing mess that wasn't trying to do anything to change that.

I started HRT again, and went a few months without a therapist. Eventually I had my current therapist/psychiatrist recommended to me by my GP and that's been a much more productive relationship than my prior one. I tried to reach out to my parents several times over the past few months, eventually told them in no uncertain terms that I was on HRT and this was moving forward [this was maybe 4 months ago].

After doing so I refrained from asking about the holidays at all, and they stopped bugging me about getting tickets. This continued until last weekend, when they asked me what my plans were. I told them that I wasn't interested in flying back for Thanksgiving, but that I'd like to come back for Christmas.

At my therapy session this week, my psychiatrist challenged me to tell my parents that my physical changes were probably more noticeable than they would have thought, and that it would be good to be up front about it instead of trying to hide myself the entire time and worrying about it [i'm not out at work either, but a hoodie still suffices for the time being]. I agreed and did so in the middle of last week. The conversation with my mom essentially went ""I'm still doing electrolysis, my hair is longer, my face has changed a little and there is some 'chest development'"". She was a bit taken aback and said she'd need a couple days to process it.

Today she called and told me that I shouldn't come home, that she still can't accept what I'm doing and that she doesn't want to be in a situation where I'm around extended family and her having to worry about my boobs being discovered or something. That essentially everything else was fine but the boobs were a bridge too far.

She then went on to tear into me saying that she doesn't see how changing my exterior will change anything in my life, that I still have yet to really go out and try to find a partner or anything, and that my life has really not changed in any respect other than what's going on with me physically. That I'm trying to do this as a means to try to fit in and find somewhere that accepts me. She doesn't feel that when I say that I'm happier with myself is enough, or even believable. She basically thinks that I'm some sort of freak if I think that I can be comfortable with my current genital situation. She also wants me to know that she's not trying to upset or hurt me but that she wants to be honest with how she feels.

I felt like shit earlier today, right now I feel pretty numb, but I know it's going to feel really really shitty as coworkers start discussing holiday plans and start asking me what I'm doing. I love my family too much to want to just cut them off altogether, but how am I supposed to keep trying to work my way through all of this? 

Thanks for reading this if you got through it all. For those of you with shorter attention spans:

**tl;dr**: boobs were a bridge too far, uninvited from going home for the holidays. feel like shit.

edit: I just wanted to say thanks to everyone who took the time to read this and left awesome messages. I'm at work now and probably won't end up replying to everyone, but know that it meant a lot to read all the positive things last night.

To everyone offering me places to stay, thanks very much for the offer, but I'll probably pass. As much as I'd love to hang out with people that accept me this christmas, I think I need to start building my own kind of traditions. I'm also currently trying to get my landlord to let me adopt a cat, so that would help a lot in the loneliness factor :3

This was based off of past conversations and just knowing him very well (he is my godfather). However, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that some of his favorite people are in this community. He was a police officer in NYC and he was telling us stories at the bar a few nights ago. One of these stories was about how, when he was off-duty, he saw a man the size of The Rock picking on a small, skinny guy. After hearing some of the conversation, he realized the guy was picking on the other for being gay. He watched the events that went on, waiting to see what happened. The bigger guy eventually started to get physical with the little guy and...the little guy kicked the living shit out of him. The little guy, seeing my uncle and recognizing him as a police officer, gave him a nervous look. My uncle, seeing him, simply waved and drove on by. The guy waved back. My uncle ended the story with ""that guy deserved to have the shit kicked out of him"". He then proceeded to tell us MORE stories about how much he loved the village and how he would tell other cops to ""just deal with"" their homophobia and even got on them for being homophobic.

But coming out at college, particularly to faculty, is a different matter.  I'm graduating in May, and I'm planning to fully transition in graduate school, so I need to actually tell my professors.

**EDIT:**  First and foremost I want to say that I can appreciate both sides of the comments I have gotten here.  For those of you who understood the sentiment I was attempting to convey, thank you for your understanding.

To those of you who were put off by my words, I am truly sorry that I may have offended you.  I know that you feel as if you don't need my approval.  As a human being, I can understand the idea of of having a trait in ones self that we should feel needs no validation.  It is simply a part of who we are.

If I may explain the reason I posted here.  I was flipping through random subs when this one popped up.  The very first post I read was by a person who was having a legitimately difficult moment in their lives.  Nobody wants to feel persecuted for how they were born.  Whether it be the orientation we were born into, the gender we had forced upon us, the religion that we follow, no one wants to feel as if they are less than the next person in line.  I felt terrible reading this persons experience. 

To any other concerns posted herein, I will attempt to address you in kind.

It's amazing what a few years can do to people's opinions, and it just goes to show how quickly America's views on gay marriage and LGBT equality is changing, and for the better. I am finally proud of my president's stance on LGBT Rights, and that the majority opinion is swinging to the right side of history, even in Southern towns such as mine.

My S.O. and I (both girls) were sitting outside the front of our high school, waiting for her mom to come pick us up. While we were waiting, a group of girls (about 4-5) came out and walked past us. They were talking about some guys that were inside; one of the girls said ""I hate gays.""

My S.O. , after that was spoken, said ""I hate you too!""

The girl: ""I wasn't talking about you.""

S.O.: ""Well, I'm gay.""

Girl: ""You're both girls so it's different""

I respond with ""That's still really homophobic.""

They're still walking away as this conversation is going on...
S.O. says ""I would rather you hate every gay person not just guys.""

Girl says ""Fine I hate everyone now.""

They're a little ways off, my girlfriend says ""Thank you!""

A different girl from that group yells out ""Will you stop commenting on everything!"", as she says this, she trips over her own feet.

My girlfriend and I laughed, along with two friends who had been sitting a few feet away talking.

After this happened, we went inside to see who they were talking about. Low and behold it was a couple friends of ours. We told them what happened and then had fun being Alphabet soup friends.

I live in a city that is really accepting of the LGBT community but I'm not surprised that there is still a lot of homophobia around.

Last year, me and a group of others found an advisor (our old advisor lost her job because of the budget cuts) and started having meetings and trying to figure out how to get the club recognized again.

We talked to the head principal, our Outreach club, our student government, the teachers' union, and the school board. The principal, Outreach, and the student government all supported us, but the teachers' union and the school board said the decision was final: there would be no GSA.

Then they changed their mind; we would need to raise around $550 to get the club back. When we said it wouldn't be a problem, they changed their minds again and said it had to be from local businesses, and then just said we wouldn't be able to get it back at all.

Where should we go from here? My school is quite homophobic (my girlfriend and I are harassed verbally by students frequently and have had rocks thrown at us by students outside of school) and I think having a GSA is entirely necessary. My school keeps pushing anti-bulling on us like there's no tomorrow, but as soon as we go to counselors and principals complaining about how people treat us, absolutely nothing is done.

I would appreciate actual help and not just linking me to some fact sheet or guide by the ACLU or GLSEN.  We've tried what they outline and more.

My tattoo is for equality, but it doesn't only symbolise marriage/gay equality, but to constantly remind myself that I'm no lesser for being gay and that I will **always** be equal.

It's also on my left ring finger for a reason.  I hope that someday the United States, or more importantly the state I come from - Wisconsin, will legalise same-sex marriage.  Once they have, I will no longer have to remind myself that I'm equal with a tattoo because I can cover it with a ring.  More specifically a wedding ring.  The wedding ring will be able to hide and replace the tattoo because I won't need to fight for equality any longer nor will I need a reminder that I'm equal because I'll know that I finally am, not only socially, but legally in the eyes of the government.

With the news of NC's unconstitutional amendment (oh, the irony?), I thought I'd give you a story to raise your spirits. As the title suggests, my roommate is gay, yet I am straight. My family, most of which are deeply religious, found out about him and pretty much gave me an ultimatum. They told me they didn't want me talking to, let alone living with, someone who has ""a blatant disregard for what is normal"", so they gave me the choice to move back in with my parents and ignore him or basically be excommunicated from my family. I haven't talked to any of them in almost 2 weeks.

I love my roommate. He's a very upstanding member of our community, and a very important figure in my life. He's fought through oppression and bigotry, only to counter that attitude not with hate, but with volunteering and community service, all on his time and dime. And as much as I love everyone in my family, I cannot stand them treating him and everyone who just so happens to be gay like they are second class citizens. I don't stand for that kind of attitude from anyone.

So, for all of you who are discouraged by the recent passing in NC, I urge you not to be. You are the ones who have fought through it, so you know it can be overcome. Armed with that attitude and the knowledge that there are many more allies like me to stand and fight alongside you, you shouldn't be discouraged. Don't be afraid to be yourself just because some people think you're not worthy.

* I mentioned I felt attracted to men (i.e. oppression by demons)
* I threw a fit (arms and legs thrashing)

This happened due to a literal interpretation of the bible; they did not seek medical advice, they simply accepted what they saw was evidence. After all, they had the bible and that was all they needed.

They were wrong.

In 1986, I plucked up the courage to talk to a counsellor. The group I left behind told me I shouldn't do this as I might lose my faith - trouble is I'd already lost it.

I lost my faith because I kept reading the bible. Cover to cover. I couldn't understand the inherent contradictions I found. I did not see why a loving god would make me gay, then say, nah, you can't be it.

My feelings towards men has never changed. It's been this since I was 11 years old. It is true that feelings towards women have appeared, but they have always been weaker than what I feel towards men. Nobody molested me or caused any trauma - until I came into contact with the christian group at university. *They* caused the trauma.

In 1986 I finally accepted being gay. I was very frightened but slowly life got better. I had my first boyfriend - that lasted two years and sadly ended badly. I made a lot of friends. I grew in confidence and the stupidity of what happened started to recede.

This cannot be wrong. **So, yeah it does get better**. I've had 26 years to see it getting better. I've been with my current partner for 11 years (well, we don't live together).

I'm not living in fear any more. I'm not aware of any supernatural forces oppressing me (not that there were any in the first place).

Yes, I'm bitter about what happened. They robbed me of a significant chunk of my life. However, I try to look at the positive side of things - not always easy, I'll admit.",,False,,t5_2tcpq,False,,pan,True,t3_1fkq38,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/1fkq38/does_it_get_better/,

Edit: Thank you for all the well wishes. Honestly, as silly as it is, seeing all these upvotes is making me cry. 

Since I'm sure some of you want to know more about him and all I figure I'll give a little background or something?

He moved to the states from Korea in 8th grade. He came knowing barely any English. So what do we do as kids? Teach him how to curse. Haha. I think the most vivid memory besides that is I was openly queer in middle school. I was always that gay kid, the freak, etc. His family owned a Korean grocery and apparently they sold some other things too. One day he came to school and handed me a rainbow belt he got from his parent's store because he knew I liked rainbows. I wore that belt until it broke. Pretty sure I cried when it broke.

I used to always proof read his English papers too since English wasn't his first language. I remember him writing on the blackboard before a Chemistry test ""Break the leg"". We all laughed pretty hard at that.

He was an amazingly talented individual. He knew several instruments quite well. He was at Rutger's in North NJ and wanted to switch his major to Music Education. He apparently had a partner at the time. I didn't see him after we graduated in '09. Something I deeply regret. I moved away from NJ right after graduating.

My friend texted me the morning of the 26th, telling me Onion was dead. I didn't believe her and I repeatedly told her this until she called me sobbing her eyes out and yelling at me that she would never fake anything like this. That's when it sunk in that this was indeed a fact. Being out in Kansas, it broke my heart I couldn't afford a plane ticket to attend the funeral in a couple days after. However, my pop-pop remembers seeing the funeral procession and he says it was the longest he's ever seen.

He touched a lot of people, and it showed. I mean, there is a memorial page for him of facebook with over 1,000 likes. Over 1,000. How many of these are people who actually knew him, I will never be sure.

24y/o male

There was a gay couple at our dinner table on the cruise. Oddly enough, one gay guy happened to be a Glenn Back-loving conservative and my dad was totally cool with them. There were 8 other 20 year olds at the table, plus my dad and me. So it was my old man with a bunch of youngsters.

A few ppl at the table silently picked up that I was gay. Later in the week, my dad happened to ask the conservative gay guy about politics and then 'coming out' when he ran into him at one of the many hot tubs. My gay buddies let me know that they thought he was ready, because they knew I was thinking of telling him, but wasn't sure.

Anyway, I was pretty ill with a virus and I told him on the last night before we went to sleep. It turns out his reasons he doesn't like equality don't totally stem from prejudice. He said he thought it would be distracting to have romance in the military, but I told him about the official Army(?) report where the people at the top admitted that the transition went without a hitch (anybody have a reference to that?).

So, I still have some convincing to do about rights, but my dad has been completely friendly and normal since then, still loves me and I assured him he'll get more used to it.

1335647795.0,172,self.ainbow,sx9rt,I want to describe my first trip to a gay club. It was more fun than I could have imagined.,Craighenn,201,29,96,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/sx9rt/i_want_to_describe_my_first_trip_to_a_gay_club_it/,"**Edit: Doing a bit of clarification. Some people misinterpreted what I meant by my original first couple paragraphs, and rightfully so, as that was some pretty poor writing on my part.**

Quick Preface:
I don't do much in the gay community. I don't go to the GSA meetings, or hang out frequently with gay guys. I've missed a lot of fun opportunities because of that. Dancing is one of those things I missed out on. I knew I sucked at dancing and constantly avoided doing it. Some gay guys can twist and spin and lock and thrust till they sweat waterfalls, but I usually would do the SAP shuffle at parties.

Now to the story:

I finally decided to go to a club last night with some friends. It was 18+ night at Town in Washington, DC. After a few minutes of dancing with my friends, I take a quick scan at all the people. I then realize that a very attractive guy is looking at me. 

We make eye contact for a second while we dance in our own groups. The moment the eye contact happen I broke away and looked down, because I couldn't believe that it had happened. When I look back, he's makes eye contact again, this time he's smiling. 

I break eye contact and smile. I make eye contact one more time and hold it, smiling. He does the same. I approach him and we start dancing. It's that typical dance where his butt is grinding up against my crotch slightly as we dance, or whatever ( like I said, I don't know dances). As I fail to match his rhythm, I confess to him how bad at dancing I was. 

He says ""Don't think about it. Just DO.""

We keep dancing through like 10 songs. We sit down on some couches in the club and talk a bit. I don't remember what was said, but pretty soon we ended up making up, on this couch. 

When we got back to dancing, it was more handy, more grindy, more ecstasy-feeling..he lifts his shirt over his head, so that only his arms are through the sleeves, but his chest is fully visible. And then he would take my hands and rub them across his chest. It was... *electric*

I stayed him him for 2 hours, dancing, sitting, kissing, dancing. Then he and his friends had to go. No phone number, but I'm okay with that, we were both visiting Town from 40 minutes away in different directions.

I can't believe that I had such an experience with a sexy stranger, and it involved dancing! By the end of the night, after he left, all insecurities about dancing were gone. I flailed in all the right ways, or whatever, until all the muscles in my chest were sore from their bending and flexing.

Everybody from any walk of life should hit the clubs! All types were there, and all types found someone to dance with. I can't wait for the next 18+ day

**TL;DR: Gay guy, can't dance, first time at club, lock eyes across the room with a stranger as the rhythm boomed, danced, made out, got good at dancing, 10/10 will dance again**

**Edit 2: I mentioned this in a comment, but I didn't want anyone who just reads the post to miss it. The guy, while the majority of the time great, ended up biting me twice on the arm and licking my knee. I don't think we're compatible long term, but the dancing was fun.**

Someone that I had known since high school. Someone that got AIDS in the first wave. He was diagnosed long before the cocktail in 1981.  

He was a zebra. He was studied and researched on intensely. He survived years until he started taking the cocktail with a perilously low T cell count. Tonight he died, at the age of 52. Died at home with his partner in their bed. They have been together all of these years both HIV positive and struggling to survive. I don't know what his partner is going to do without him.

Allen loved his mother, but his family shunned him because they were religious and he had AIDS. He was considered an embarrassment by his parents. One of his goals was to live longer than his mother, so she wouldn't know the pain of losing a child. He cared more about her, than either of his parents cared about him. 

I have seen Allen and Steven evicted for being gay, fired for being gay and generally reviled for being a gay couple in a small, conservative town. I have seen narrow minded assholes walk out of there way to avoid them, when it was clear that they were both infected and very often quite weak. 

He was one of the kindest, sweetest men I have ever met. Very small and graceful and he always had a sweet smile and a kind word for everyone. He was especially dear to me, since he was on of the people that I knew in school that never bullied me. 

My mother had gay male friends when I was growing up. I have had gay male friends all of my life. They are some of my dearest and most beloved friends. And one by one, I watched a lot of them die from AIDS. From the group I knew in high school and college, only 2 of them survive. 

I want to remember the triumph that was Allen's life. I want to remember how much he loved his life partner, how being with him was worth not existing in the closet, even though it meant completely alienating his family. I want to remember the person who spent so much time in the hospital as a research subject cheerfully, because he hoped what they learned from him would help others. I want to remember the kind nature and the sweet, goofy smile. That is the strong, wonderful gay man that I want to continue to celebrate and keep in my memory.  

When things get you down, I want you to think about Allen. A man that lived, in spite of the bigotry, with the man he loved for 30 years. A man that never let the bitterness that society dished out to him for his life choices, make him frowny or mean. A gay man that lived on his own terms, proudly and bravely. A man that never lost his quiet sense of humor, despite adversity and discrimination.

While we see attitudes changing and realize that they are not changing nearly quickly enough, I want to take a moment to remember the men that I knew that lived and died bravely. Men who refused to live in a closet. Men to whom being themselves, was more important than what anyone thought of them.

They were proud that they got everyone to laugh. 

I wrote a comment, but before I could post it, the comic was deleted. However, I felt pretty strongly about it I wanted to post it somewhere. I normally don't do this, but after starting to work in public schools, and seeing all the shit that goes on there, I thought I would leave this here:

""Look. I get humor. I really do. But let me clear something up for you:

The person who didn't laugh? It may not have been because they like Twilight. It may have been that they actually were gay. They sat there, in the dark and listened to you use that word to mean ""a worthless piece of shit"", and be rewarded with everyone laughter. A word that describes their identity. A word that describes who they are just for being alive. 

Have you ever sat in a room, had someone yell out that you were a worthless piece of shit, then had everyone laugh at you? Laugh at you because everything they see on TV, in the movies, and in their families tell them that, in fact, its TRUE, and that you are a worthless piece of shit? You go to school every day trying to hide the fact that you are, well, just you, and that if anyone finds out who you are, they will remind you of how worthless you are by kicking your ass every day, threatening you, and telling you you will burn in eternity. For just being alive.

Yeah, its hard to imagine huh?

1331696213.0,162,self.ainbow,qvnfk,Closing a chapter; thoughts on /r/LGBT,joeycastillo,211,49,375,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/qvnfk/closing_a_chapter_thoughts_on_rlgbt/,"Hey all. Mods here. In case you haven't seen it, there is a [post up on /r/LGBT](http://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/qs8jl/rlgbts_new_direction/) that mentions us. If you'd like, feel free to take a moment to read it. 

A little backstory: last week, the mods at /r/LGBT reached out to us. Recognizing the gravity of the situation over there and some of the mistakes that were made, they decided to make some changes. They expanded their mod list. They enumerated clear rules. RobotAnna in particular apologized for how antagonistic she had been in interactions with our community. 

She also said that seeing how /r/ainbow has evolved has caused them to re-evaluate. Their words: 

&gt; We have spoken with r/ainbow's moderators and have come to the
mutually agreeable conclusion that there is a need for a safe space
and r/lgbt can fill that need, and also that there is a demand for
unmoderated open discussion. No rivalry. No us vs. them. We fill one
need, they fill another. We welcome you to join both communities. We
have.

Just to be clear: I do not believe we are an unsafe space, and I think the other mods would agree. Nonetheless, we recognize that a more hands-on moderation style is attractive to some, and we believe that they have taken the steps necessary to implement hands-on moderation in a transparent and fair way.  For that reason we're going to link to them in the sidebar. We're also doing this as a gesture of goodwill; they have done the same for us. 

What else does this mean? Not much. /r/ainbow will continue to be exactly what it has been: a very loosely moderated free speech zone for the discussion of LGBT issues. But we do ask that you refrain from attacking /r/LGBT here. They are their own community, with their own standards, and we ask that you respect them in the same way that they will respect us. No more rivalry; just two communities operating side by side. 

They have also set up a [system to handle community feedback transparently](http://reddit.com/r/lgbtopenmodmail), so there's no need to bring disagreements with them here. 

There was a lot of upfuckedness that went down in the last couple of months, and the mods of /r/LGBT are responsible for regaining the trust of their community. But speaking personally, I've watched some of their changes in action this past week. I've seen their moderation style become more transparent and respectful toward the community; and while it differs greatly from our style, I personally believe this new direction can work for them. I never unsubscribed from /r/lgbt, but if I had, this would be the moment for me to resubscribe.

tl;dr: We wish /r/lgbt the best, and they wish us the best. The überdrama is behind us. Let's live together in peace. ",,False,,t5_2tcpq,False,,ainbow,True,t3_qvnfk,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/qvnfk/closing_a_chapter_thoughts_on_rlgbt/,moderator

Kenneth Zucker is a dreadful and abusive man. I have many friends that went to him as children. While he treats adult patients curteously, he is mentally, verbally, and sexually abusive towards all child patients, and has been for his entire career. He is a long-time practicer of transsexual (and before it was illegal, homosexual) conversion therapy, and his conversion therapy involves screaming at your child things like ""DON'T YOU WANT TO BE NORMAL, YOU SICK LITTLE FUCKING FREAK?"" Throwing things at them, and hitting them in ways that won't leave markings. He forces children as young as 3 to watch pornography and insists on teaching them ""the correct way to masturbate as their gender."" He tells them that if they ever allow themselves to cross-dress, their friends will hate them, their families will hate them, and society will hate them. He tells them they're broken.
Worst of all, he actually teaches them ways to efficiently kill themselves should they ever ""relapse"" back into their ""disorder.""

However, he immediately puts all adult patients on HRT because he considers them ""lost causes.""

I recognize that these are pretty big allegations, but I hear identical stories from all 4 of my friends that saw him. This is the truth, I guarantee it. Avoid him and the entirety of the Centre for Addiction and Mental Heath at all costs.



I forgot to mention that they sit the transsexual children, even the toddlers, with all the ""other perverts,"" including the pedophiles. One of my friends was hit on by a 40 year old dude while waiting for her appointment with Zucker. 

Also this dude is *the head of the DSM-V committee on LGBT affairs*",,False,,t5_2tcpq,1359876656.0,,,True,t3_17sgl4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ainbow/comments/17sgl4/do_not_send_your_children_to_kenneth_zucker/,
