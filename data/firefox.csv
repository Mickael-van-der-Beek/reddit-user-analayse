1376393291.0,207,self.firefox,1k9smb,Why does desktop Firefox repaint so inefficiently?,Vegemeister,251,44,113,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1k9smb/why_does_desktop_firefox_repaint_so_inefficiently/,"I was trying to figure out why Firefox scrolls so much more smoothly on my aging smartphone than on my much-faster-on-paper x86 machine, when I discovered `nglayout.debug.paint_flashing`.  Apparently, mobile Firefox is [painting into reasonably-sized offscreen buffers and compositing them in slightly different positions as necessary](http://i.imgur.com/yhJaJCq.png). Also, it would seem that the page is drawn beyond the boundaries of the viewport so that redrawing is not required on every frame.

Desktop FF, on the other hand, [paints a tiny little sliver of newly-visible content at the bottom of the viewport on every frame](http://i.imgur.com/LLSAhUw.png).  This makes it incapable of scrolling without dropped frames unless I resize the window to less than half the width of my monitor.  It's also not good for battery life.

I think perhaps someone from the graphics team should challenge themselves to spend a week doing all their work and leisure on a Lenovo X61 (or other machine of similar GPU capability) driving a 1920x1080 external screen.  These kinds of problems don't become apparent when the only computers you use are workstations with discrete graphics cards and laptops with Sandy Bridge+ integrated GPUs.

I know the Javascript wars are sexy and exciting, and it is very impressive that Firefox has surpassed Chrome in JS benchmarks, but very few pages have computationally intensive scripts.  Nearly all of them have scrolled content of varying complexity.  The most JS-intensive pages I encounter on a regular basis are PDFs, and those have matching graphical complexity (hundreds of separately styled elements on screen at once, etc.).",,False,self,t5_2qh4p,False,,,True,t3_1k9smb,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1k9smb/why_does_desktop_firefox_repaint_so_inefficiently/,

We don't want Chrome's flashy download animation, ""unsurprising"" inability to stop GIF animations, objectively incorrect autocomplete behavior, distractingly cluttered ""blank"" page, or an add-on bar that for some reason isn't also a classic status bar. We don't want every new option you guys add enable by default and reduced to an about:config boolean. If we wanted all of Chrome's take-it-or-leave-it minimalist nonsense, well, we already know where to find it.

Firefox is still the best browser out there (as evidenced by how it took only hours and a modicum of acidic cursing to get things configured properly again) but you sure don't act like you know it. Every time I update I have to trawl through forums and install another stupidly-named extension just to make FF recognizable. When you look at user statistics and wonder why a third of your users refuse to upgrade - this is why. I've been using FF since before 1.0 and the process is a frustrating mess *every single time.* 

I know you have have UX folks, because you did that silly centered/dark thing with standalone images. You aren't just cribbing Google's notes here. If you won't stop cribbing entirely, at least weed out genuinely improved features like tab task management from anti-features like being unable to stop GIFs for the first time since 1997. It's fantastic that Firefox is flexible enough to look and act like any other browser, but please, let it look and act like itself by default.

I soon noticed what was going on, though.

IE 10 is apparently choosing to render pages as fast as it can, jumpy layout while it's rendering be damned. Firefox is instead by default choosing to show the page at first only after 250 milliseconds to attempt to avoid this, invisibly starting to render the page before this.

If you prefer to see the page appear while it's rendered as fast as possible like in IE 10, enter about:config in the address bar, right-click in that window and create a new key of type Integer with the name **nglayout.initialpaint.delay** Then set this value to **0**. Restart Firefox.

If you want to revert to default behavior, go to the same page, enter _nglayout_ in the search box, and now right-click and choose ""Restore"" for this key (shown in bold since it's a custom value) that you had added.

Really?,Pnikosis,100,29,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/qihgp/firefox_consumes_too_much_memory_really/,"During the last years, Firefox team has been ~~hardly working~~ working hard on fixing the infamous browser's memory leaks. And I think they have done a great job. But I don't know why, some people still insist that Firefox is not memory-efficient, specially compared to other browsers.

The thing that amazes me the most, is that most of these claims address Chrome as an efficient browser.

So I made s simple, non-scientific test. Right now I have Firefox with 53 tabs open (yes, that's fifty three), and Chrome with 13 (thirteen, that's right), and [this is what I got](http://i.imgur.com/keLJ8.png).

I love Chrome, I use it constantly alongside with Firefox as some apps are great in it. But it is far from being the most resource-efficient browser (I just checked Chrome's about:memory page, and now it's over 1 Gb), so people should always check the extensions they have installed before blaming on the browser itself.

BTW: Opera is far better than Chrome in terms of memory usage, and I still find that Firefox consumes less.",,False,self,t5_2qh4p,True,,,True,t3_qihgp,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/qihgp/firefox_consumes_too_much_memory_really/,

I'll go first.",ragflan,76,13,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1acja1/alright_rfirefox_lets_have_it_what_are_you/,"Hope everyone can suggest stuff with a small description. I've provided links to all recommended stuff here. 

**Privacy and Security Addons**:

1. [NoScript](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/noscript/) - This is daunting to most users but once you get a whitelist of the sites you frequent, NoScript is infinitely useful. NoScript also speeds up site loading and makes Firefox more responsive. [Read this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1acja1/alright_rfirefox_lets_have_it_what_are_you/c8w4n5y) to test it for yourself. Credit to [sweetkarmajuice](http://www.reddit.com/user/sweetkarmajuice)

2. [AdBlock+](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adblock-plus/) - Everyone knows about this. I use the following filters - [Fanboy Adblock, Fanboy Tracking and Fanboy Annoyances](https://www.fanboy.co.nz/). Tracking list disables trackers and annoyances disables social plugins. I personally trust this setup little more than Ghostery because the list is transparent and user/community maintained as opposed to Ghostery but I'd love to be proven wrong and shown why Ghostery is better. 

3. [CookieMonster](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-monster/) - Manages cookies. You can either whitelist (block all except allowed) or blacklist (block only those not allowed). As [darkon](http://www.reddit.com/user/darkon) has [pointed out in the comments](http://www.reddit.com/user/darkon), you don't need this addon if you manage cookies through Firefox Options by yourself. This addon is for convenience and ease of use.

4. [BetterPrivacy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/betterprivacy/) - Remove/Manage Flash Cookies (LSOs). This extension doesn't conflict with CookieMonster.

5. [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) - Enabled HTTPS where available and encrypts data between you and the server you're communicating with. 

6. [Collusion by Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/collusion/) - Install this addon and visit a few sites and then view the Collusion data. It shows where your data was being transmitted to. For example, visiting Gizmodo sends your data to viddler.com, gravatar.com, onsugar.com, gawkerassets.com, alluremedia.com.au and youtube.com. I had NoScript enabled.

7. [RefControl](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/refcontrol/) - Recommended by [sweetkarmajuice](http://www.reddit.com/user/sweetkarmajuice). Control what gets sent as HTTP Referer.

8. *[RequestPolicy](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/requestpolicy/) - I'm still playing with Addon but it's recommended as commonly as NoScript is.* **Update**: I wouldn't recommend this unless you're willing to have complete control and put up with the consequences. It blocks more things than NoScript does.

9. [Self Destructing Cookies](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/self-destructing-cookies/) - Recommended by [viccoy](http://www.reddit.com/user/viccoy). This is a very good addon. You can set cookies to be cleared when the tab closes or when the browser closes. You can also define cookies that will permanently be stored. Very useful.

&gt;
&gt;


**Privacy and Security Userscripts (these require either [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) or [Scriptish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/scriptish/)):**

1. [Straight Google](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/121261) - Removes tracking/redirection from Google search results. 

2. [Google Hit Hider by Domain](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/95205) - Not really for privacy but allows you to remove search results to domains you don't visit. When I search for a solution to tech problems, I always get Experts-Exchange (which I now know you can use Google Cache to get the solution) which only shows the question but no solutions, so I block that domain from search results to get answers from better sources.

**Privacy and Security Tips and Tricks / about:config tips as well**

1. [Check for updates to Plugins](http://www.mozilla.com/plugincheck/) - Always update your plugins, especially Java and Flash. Also, disable plugins everywhere and only enable them by whitelisting sites. To do this, go to about:config and search for **plugins.click_to_play** and set it to true. Then you can Whitelist sites such as YouTube.

2. Not related to Firefox but I use **[Filehippo's Update Checker](http://www.filehippo.com/updatechecker/)** to check my machine for outdated Windows applications (which include Java, Flash and other applications which have plugins in Firefox like iTunes and VLC). It's like Windows Update but for non-Windows applications. It's not perfect because it can only check with its own database which won't have all Windows applications but it has all the popular ones.

3. If you're not using CookieMonster, disable Third Party Cookies via Tools -&gt; Options -&gt; Privacy -&gt; Use Custom Settings for History -&gt; Uncheck 'Accept third-party cookies'. **NOTE**: This can break functionality on some sites. Simplest Example: Google Takeout. If you had third-party cookies disabled and you were trying to export Google Reader data through Google Takeout, the download would've failed. 



**Note:** This is a self-post so I don't need any upvotes. In fact, downvote the thread if you find that it doesn't contribute anything of value. I'm just seeking to learn from any tips you have and share any that I've learnt.

**EDIT 1:** I find that Adblock with the 3 filters (Adblock, Tracking and Annoyances) blocks everything that Ghostery or DoNotTrackPlus block. So, personally, I don't see the benefit of having an additional addon since ABP handles this already. I'm still waiting for someone to prove me wrong on this and show that Ghostery is superior.

**EDIT 2:** Added a few more extensions as recommended by users. Thanks for all the contributions guys.

The Mobile Firefox team has spent the past six months totally rewriting Firefox for Android, and now we are getting ready to release a first beta of the new version.  This is the new ""native"" UI which starts up faster, uses less memory, and supports the Adobe Flash plugin.

While there are still some known crashes and a few missing features, we think it's nearing beta quality.  This would be an awesome time to download an [Aurora](http://mozilla.org/mobile/aurora/) build.  Just running it and submitting automatic crash reports will help us figure out what needs the most work.  We also welcome any other bug reports or feedback.

Note: The native UI is not yet optimized for large tablets.  We'll continue shipping the old UI to tablets for now.

Connecting to servers for sites listed on the new tab page, essentially at random, reveals usage habits to whoever operates the network you are using at the time. 

Consider someone who frequently accesses intranet servers from a laptop and takes that machine offsite.  Firefox will happily reveal the structure of the company LAN and interesting addresses to coffee shops, customers, and enterprising honeypot operators.  Consider a person who uses the same laptop at home and at work, and often browses [lolibooru](http://lolibooru.com/) [NSFW] at home.  All it takes is one bored and curious sysadmin, and people could find themselves trying to explain their taste in pornography to HR, despite never intentionally browsing porn at work.

One of the big advantages Firefox currently has over Chromium is that its address bar autocompletion (""Awesome Bar"") is entirely local.  It's results are reasonably predictable, taken only from the set of previously visited sites, and highly relevant to a particular user.  This is all accomplished, however, without storing any data offsite or revealing any information to the outside.  International spies can safely use the Firefox Awesome Bar to autocomplete the address to the secret topic on the mundane UBB forum which they access via Tor and post stegonographically encoded state secrets.  They apparently cannot, however, allow their mouse pointer to pass anywhere near the frequently visited site buttons on the new-tab page.

What do the Firefox devs have to say about this?

&gt;Would there be a need to send the DNT header

...

&gt;AFAIK, this just opens a connection to the server but does not yet send a GET request or the like. So I think we'd be fine with DNT header here as that is sent when the user actually clicks the page.

...

&gt;The server knows only about the user's IP address so far and shouldn't be able to really use that for tracking purposes.

...

&gt;I don't see a privacy issue with this as no user data is being sent, as long as any DNT pref is sent on the actual connection we should be fine.

Some misunderstand the issue.

&gt;In a public network, for instance, you may want to visit only certain sites without letting others know about your other favorite sites. Moving the mouse over a thumbnail doesn't necessarily mean you're going to click it, so we're potentially leaking this.

A few do not.

&gt; I believe that we shouldn't be concerned about this leak, but we need to make a decision here so we can move this bug along.

...

&gt;We decided against a pref in bug 814169. Is there reason to revisit that decision?

Some just don't care.

&gt; we should be aware of what the benefit and chance of knee-jerk reactions might be.

Consider this a knee-jerk reaction. :-)",,False,self,t5_2qh4p,1367044301.0,,,True,t3_1d7dnu,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1d7dnu/wtf_bug_790882/,

I don't have to have crap tons of windows open just multi-task?!"" , and this was way before I discovered Firefox had add-ons. Had a virus on my old PC, a fake scanner website and at the time I was naive, on IE7, and this was when I found out about firefox. IE7 never even opened yet Firefox never crashed. On my new PC afterwords, I upgraded from 3.6 to 4, and still never had any crashes, just that I hated the new look *Didn't know how to add the menu bar back then* but other than that, never had it hang or freeze or even crash. I skipped Firefox 5 for 7 Aurora, and never looked back. Aurora was more stable than Firefox 5 for as far as I could tell from the Firefox users with constant problems. From Firefox 7, to 8, to 9 Aurora for a few days and now Firefox Nightly UX. Even on the very early Alpha stages of the browser, I've never had a single crash or freeze.

I just found these recently, so I'm not sure if one is more effective than the other, or if they shouldn't be used at the same time (I'm assuming they shouldn't, but with stuff like this, instructions usually overlap instead of overwrite each other)...

If you've ever encountered ""anti-Adblock"" countermeasures on a website that restrict interaction or deny access in some way, these are supposed to combat this practice. I don't know exactly what the differences are between them, but at least one of the commonalities probably works by countering a website's Javascript ""query"" that detects whether or not Adblock is being used.

However, something really strange was happening when switching a tab, loading a new page and so on. The CPU would be pegged at 100% on one core. That's 100% CPU usage for people with a single core CPU, 50% CPU usage for people with a dual core CPU and 25% CPU usage for people with a quad core CPU.


Obviously, the browser would completely hang during this time and you couldn't do anything until it did its thing.


I was only using 5 addons. What could have possibly caused something like this? It was time to enable the Gecko Profiler and profile Firefox while it was hanging.


Two minutes later, I had a profile. This profile also included a profile of the exact same issue triggered by clicking on the Gecko Profiler button.
The profile was saying everything quite clearly: it really looked like Greasemonkey was causing this problem. It accounted for about 80-90% of the time spent doing something during the profiling period.


Disabling Greasemonkey completely fixed my issue right away. The browser was much snappier now.
This is very strange as the only script I had in Greasemonkey was supposed to run only on a certain website.


If your Firefox is slow, you might want to install the Gecko Profiler and leave it running in the background. Once the issue manifested itself, go to the profiler and click ""analyze"". This will load the profile. You should now be able to take a look at the profile to find the red areas.
Select the red areas and you should now have an interval. Switch the tab to ""selected interval"". Now you should be able to expand the tree below to show you where time is spent. You'll have to find where the big percentage is.
In my case, a big greasemonkey icon was shown beside one of the entries. That meant the issue was either being triggered by greasemonkey or that greasemonkey itself was causing it. Either way, greasemonkey was causing high CPU usage and a pretty lenghty stall.

If you find an addon there the same way, you should disable it and see if the issue occurs again.

However, this hasn't fixed the really slow startup problems I've been facing since upgrading to FF19b1. I'm still trying to figure that out.

Might wanna see this...,Eslader,64,19,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/133zwf/shopping_on_amazon_with_firefox_might_wanna_see/,"My SO and I were looking for a twin pack of those electric toothbrushes. She found one she wanted me to look at for $153.25, and shot me the link so I could see it on my machine. Surprisingly, it came up as $171.99 on my end. We're in the same room, so I turned around and verified the link. Yep, same link. But she was using Chrome, while I was still on Firefox. 

So I fired up Chrome, and copied the link out of Firefox, and pasted it into Chrome. $153.25! 

That's interesting. Hit up a friend who lives on the west coast. She opened it in Firefox. $171.99. 

Then I looked closer. Chrome was sending me to a different vendor than Firefox. The cheaper vendor has more expensive shipping, but after you factor in shipping, Firefox users are still paying $10.35 more than Chrome users. I tried hard refreshing, clearing cookies, the works, but Firefox consistently went to the more expensive vendor, while Chrome consistently went to the cheaper one.

So I opened up a chat with Amazon. The supervisor claims I'm the first one to notice this, and he'll talk to marketing about it, but I've seen similar complaints (Amazon Prime members being charged more for the same product than non-Prime members, etc) around the web. 

Anyway, here are a couple of screen shots:

I have twin monitors, so I opened Chrome on the left and Firefox on the right. You can see the link is the same. The only edit in this picture was to remove my name and some stuff on the task bar that could identify other people. 

http://i.imgur.com/ZzDjv.jpg

And here's the chat log with the first customer service rep, who didn't know any answers, but told me that ""Mozilla is the preferred browser.""   (Well. Yeah, if I could charge people more for using Mozilla, it'd be my preferred browser too). She never used my name, so I didn't have to make any edits to this shot:

http://i.imgur.com/tFqWj.png

And here's her supervisor, who to his credit was fine with me posting this information for others to read. I have edited my real name out of this picture, but otherwise it is untouched. (I didn't bother editing their names out, since we all know they're fake names):

http://i.imgur.com/WKKy9.png


And finally, here's the product link, so you can play with it yourself. I'd be interested to know what prices you guys come up with (be sure to check who it's sold by too, as that changes based on browser for me).

What you probably don't know is that Australis is not just a theme, but a rewrite of much of the UI of Firefox - with much less customization.

Just so you know I'm not talking out my ass, here is the primary dude talking about the UX team's plans: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=860814#c3

Horrifying, isn't it?

Well, Mozilla doesn't care. They won't let you complain on Bugzilla (""constructive comments only"" - that is, agree with us or we will delete your comment), and you'll note that the above bugzilla comment redirects comments to the firefox-dev mailing list.

So, surely that's where you would post criticism? I tried to do exactly that - unfortunately, Firefox-dev is a moderated mailing list - posts must be approved before posting. And funnily enough, there are no critical posts in that mailing list. There's one post by the same guy who made the plan, and no replies at all. (I spent 20 minutes writing a post in which I put forward practical solutions as an alternative to the hack n' slash approach taken currently, but it was rejected because I used a couple of snarky words at the beginning. I'll try again soon, see if I can whittle away the excuses until they simply say ""I don't want you criticising me!"").

So, if this upsets you, we need your help. Currently, Mozilla may not even be aware that there is any opposition - their censorship is so good that I'M not sure if there is much. The only place in which this is actually being discussed is MozillaZine - an unofficial Mozillian community. The thread in question is [here](http://forums.mozillazine.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&amp;t=2688023), and I encourage you to read it through. After reading that, I hope you will join me in contacting Mozilla in any way you can. If you can get a post onto Firefox-dev, then that's fantastic. The bugzilla bug is still open, so although it is not allowed, if you can get some coherent criticism in there before you're banned and the bug is closed, please do so.

Email people, talk about it publicly in any relevant forum, participate in the Mozillazine discussion - any publicity helps. Spread the word, and hopefully we will be heard.

Alternatively, in a few months we'll be forking Firefox. That's gonna be a tonne of fun... ",,False,self,t5_2qh4p,False,,,True,t3_1cl352,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1cl352/psa_the_ux_team_is_destroying_firefoxs/,

Apparently this feature was implemented because it is faster for users with good internet connections. The [YouTube Center](http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/114002) user script for Greasemonkey/Scriptish can disable this and revert to the old buffering where you can skip to any point in the loaded video without re-downloading. It also seems to let you buffer the entire video.

I've tried it out and it seems to work as advertised, but skipping backwards is iffy. And if it doesn't work, it still has a ton of useful features for YouTube. The developer also suggests enabling auto-buffering, disabling auto-playback and disabling dash playback for those with slow internet connections. Hope it helps for some of you!

However, on Firefox, even with the HTML5 flag in the URL + opting in to the HTML5 beta (http://youtube.com/html5) videos that quite clearly play in HTML5/WebM with this Chrome extension (and thus are encoded in WebM -- I remember reading that Google basically converted their entire catalog into WebM, and all new videos get WebM automatically) use Flash to play in Firefox.

Is anyone aware of a method to force YouTube videos to use WebM without Flash on Firefox?

EDIT: Thanks to /u/nispsylol for pointing me to [this Greasemonkey script](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/87011) -- does exactly what I wanted.

It's likely that the reason why the WebM codecs exist for so many YouTube videos, but aren't available by default (even in the HTML5 beta) on the desktop is because they were meant for mobile devices, where Flash is not an option. Forcing desktop users to use Flash allows for more ads and such.

EDIT2: Also, it looks like another Greasemonkey script, [Youtube Center](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/114002), forces WebM/HTML5 as well.

The first page of the official Firefox support forums is about 50% threads on this issue...

I've tried:

- reinstalling
- new profile (including the recent thread in this sub-reddit)
- safe mode (no extensions)
- updating flash
- updating video card driver
- disabling hardware acceleration
- updating to 6.0.1 and then 6.0.2
- messing around in about:config

I've used Firefox since 2004 when they first pushed out version 1, I've sold dozens of people on it (instead of IE), I've had it on an old laptop for over 4 years with the same old bogged-down profile and it never had problems... none of the many things people are suggesting will fix this freezing problem seem to be applicable to me. And to add another layer, my Firefox has been springing up many instances of the plugin container randomly throughout the day such that I'll often see more than 5-10 instances of it in Task Manager, each using their own little bits of memory...

I guess it's more of a traumatic experience than could be expected when a piece of software.. nay, a dear friend - and yes, Firefox has been a good companion ever since it saved me from the wretched grasp of one Internet Explorer - suddenly takes a turn for the worse out of the blue. I don't know what to expect, and I can't do anything about it.

You no longer require another Add-on([Add-on Compatibility Reporter](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/add-on-compatibility-reporter/)) to make add-ons that are marked as incompatible work again. Just type ""about:config"" without the quotes in your address bar, then find the entry ""extensions.strictCompatibility"" and double click it to change the value to ""false"". 

Please remember though that this does not guarantee add-ons will actually work. They may actually be incompatible. But, the vast majority of the time the only problem is the maxVersion for the add-on has not been bumped.

*edit

I guess I should clarify a little. While the feature is in Firefox 10/11 now, it isn't enabled by default, yet, hence having to toggle the about:config entry. My apologies for any confusion. It should be enabled by default by the time Firefox 10 hits the stable channel.

*edit2

I should further clarify that this will only work with add-ons that are marked as compatible with Firefox 4 or higher. It will NOT work with ones marked with a maxVersion of 3.6 for example.

About 5% of Firefox users are still using Firefox 3.6 or older, which is about 3 years old and is 8 months past its support cycle (no more patches).

Another 5% or so are running versions 4-9, which are at least a year old depending on the version and are similarly unsupported.

*Make sure to follow the steps one by one! *

*This was supposed to be a comment to help out a guy that issues with Firefox (that it isn't responding at times) and I figured that I might as well post like this.*

**Here's the guide:**

---

* Firstly you want to backup your bookmarks from your current profile. You can find out how you do that [here](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Backing_up_and_restoring_bookmarks_-_Firefox).

---

* Now you want to backup your history file. It's called **places.sqlite** and can be found in your current profile folder (most likely default if you're not using any other). Your profile folder can be found at (one of these):


        Windows (use Run to use this path, just remove profile folder at the end of the path and it'll work):
        %APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\*profile folder*

        Mac OS X:
        ~/Library/Mozilla/Firefox/Profiles/*profile folder*  
        ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*profile folder*


        Linux (note, the profile folder is hidden, check the very bottom for an article for how to unhide it)
        ~/.mozilla/firefox/*profile folder*

---

* Then you should make a new profile, [which you can find out how to do here](http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Profiles).

---

* Now that you've backed up your bookmarks and history and you've created your new profile through the profile manager you are ready to transfer them to your new profile. 

  Simply move the **places.sqlite** into your new profile folder and start up Firefox. If you don't have your bookmarks yet - import the bookmarks you just backed up (they're usually included in the **places.sqlite** file).

---

* Now that you've made your new profile transferred over the bookmarks and history there's one more thing to do. Clean up the history. 

  It can be done by an add-on called [Form History Control](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/form-history-control/) and what it does is that it removes unnecessary history that you never use. *For instance, pages that you've only visited once the last three months.* You can choose the settings yourself.

---

* Now you have an extremely clean profile and Firefox should be working at its top performance with all your bookmarks and history you had from before.

---

**Other useful information:**

* Make sure you have the latest versions of your plugins. You can check your plugins if you've the latest or not through the [Plugin Checker by Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/).

* Remember to add a subscription or two for your Adblock Plus. Subscriptions [can be found here](http://adblockplus.org/en/subscriptions). Then all the ads will already be removed from the sites (you don't have to do anything).

* The [article](/http://kb.mozillazine.org/Show_hidden_files_and_folders#Linux) for Linux.

I'm coming back now, because chrome just seems to be more of a placebo in terms of speed than anything else. I miss my more reliable AdBlockPlus and NoScript combo. 

What's the state of Firefox at the moment?
Should I be getting the Stable Release, Nightly, Palemoon, Waterfox, or 64-bit nightly? 
Are there any new ""must-have"" add-ons?
Did Firefox ever fix the weird issue with Dual-Monitors? (When I move a tab from one screen to another screen, the area clicks would displace. An example is if I say move a tab with youtube on it to the other screen, I wouldn't be able to click on the play button directly, I would have to put my cursor a little bit higher or lower to click it.)

**Firefox has fixed this.**

Can Firefox sync to my Android phone without using the Firefox app?

**Use app called Browser to Phone, or just contribute to the Firefox app dev, by using it.**

As a note, I've really struggled choosing a Web Browser, but always somehow going back to Firefox. Opera was great, but some websites just wouldn't work and my memory usage just kept ramping up past 700mb all the time unless I disabled parts of Opera. Chrome is fantastic, but the AdBlock extension just doesn't stack up to Firefox plus the NoScript.

*[EDIT]* Has Firefox fixed it's memory issues? I tested for a short time on the stable release and 2-3 tabs at 1 hour was using around 250mb, while chrome being left on all day with 10-15 tabs was only using 180mb.

*[EDIT]* I can also confirm that this:
&gt;"" I've also just realized this, but for dual monitors, if I have firefox on one of my monitors, and then start a video on youtube or something and move that to the other monitor and try to fullscreen, it will full screen on the wrong monitor.""

Note that you should first backup your profiles folder before doing anything. It is located here for Windows users:

C:\Users\&lt;YOUR USERNAME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles

You can access the AppData quicker by typing in %APPDATA% into Run (open Run by Windows key+R).

1. Make a separate icon for use as your ""private browsing"" Firefox icon. You can just copy and paste your current icon and give it another name so you can distinguish between the two different ones. [\[Image\]](http://i.imgur.com/R7cs7.png)

2. Right-click on the ""private browsing"" Firefox shortcut and click on properties. Add -P to the end of the target. [\[Image\]](http://i.imgur.com/pdObN.png)

3. Open the ""private browsing"" Firefox shortcut and a profile manager will come up on the screen. Create a new profile and remember the profile name. [I have made a new profile called ""Plain"" here.](http://i.imgur.com/758hD.png)

4. Exit the profile manager and right-click on the ""private browsing"" Firefox shortcut and go back to the properties. Now add the name of your new profile to the end of the target in speech marks, and then add -no-remote after that. [See my example for help.](http://i.imgur.com/H2nX3.png)

5. Now open the shortcut again. You'll notice that since you are using a new profile, everything will be reset back to default - do not be alarmed since your settings are safe in your old profile. You need to go into the Options -&gt; Privacy and set the History option to use custom settings. Make sure the box saying use private browsing is ticked. [\[Image\]](http://i.imgur.com/yC69q.png)

6. You are now finished with the ""private browsing"" Firefox. Whenever you wish to open private browsing without closing your current session, just use that new shortcut that you have created. However, now you will now have to set your default (normal) Firefox icon to use your normal profile when browsing regularly. Right-click your normal Firefox icon, go to Properties and add -P to the end, followed by the name of your default profile (remember you created a new profile using the profile manager? we need the name of the default profile here), followed by -no-remote. [See my example here for help \(my default profile was named Main\).](http://i.imgur.com/EMmNU.png)

You are now finished and can shop for presents for your significant other without closing your current session!

I really like it, haven't been swayed by Opera or Chrome yet.

I was taken in by the new release plan, it seemed a very good one but there is a big problem for me as a private home user, and that's the exact same as one corporate user complained about a few weeks ago: 

**I want my browser to be dependable and my user experience to be predictable**

I know, i know - who cares about ""dependable"" or ""predictable"" as long as we have ""kool""

Now extension developers have the same objectives, they want their extensions to be predictable therefore they test them against known versions etc. etc. (like that corporate dev) so they set specific upper limits on versions and when FF passes that version it's no longer guaranteed to be compatible thus not installed/updated.

With the new release plan a new version is passed every two weeks or so.

This problem has got to be solved or FF is going to lose it's most important advantage over the competition

- or rather it is already lost and needs to be regained extremely fast.

There must be a way to ensure devs that major version numbers are in fact not major.

/rant

I can sort of see the idea of pushing innovation ahead in a take no prisoners kind of way and swiftly getting rid of legacy code (like code that's more than a month old?) but others have managed to do this in a less radical fashion.

I realize that I am using FF6 beta which should explain the problem.

[Here's mine.](http://img542.imageshack.us/img542/2320/screenshot2013042311194.png) Addons:

* Stratiform for basic styling. I used to use Classic Compact, but wanted something a bit more modern looking without deviating from the Windows aesthetic.
* Personal Titlebar to have the app menu, conventional drop-down menu bar menus and a window title all coexisting on the same row
* Personal Menu to customize the app menu. Mostly moved the functions of the drop-down menus I don't have displayed over here. I still prefer standalone drop-downs for history and bookmarks, hence the previous extension. 
* Roomy Bookmarks Toolbar for bookmarks. Tighter padding and favicons only.

I decided to take a serious look at Chrome after many years with FF.
The reason for this was that I think FF is to slow on sites that are picture(elements) heavy, I frequent them a lot.

In my experience Chrome is a snappy browser. It certainly was what I needed when speed is in mind. But when it comes to extensions, options and needs it really didn't make the cut for me. Some of this is o/c based on habits and preferences that will not apply to a new user. 

Thoughts:

Negatives:

Spell checker

Adblock

Lack of editing the UI. FF is not perfect, but it does a better job IMO.

And many other things that I don't like. But this are things that apply for preferences.

Positives:

Snappy

Some great extensions/scripts. I really liked the translate extension.

And I'm back on FF now.:)",,False,self,t5_2qh4p,False,,,True,t3_r13ye,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/r13ye/a_week_with_chrome/,

Search Hijacking, where third parties change the default search engine against the user's wishes, has been a huge problem for Firefox (especially for non-technical users).  This is Mozilla's attempt to protect the user from such hijacking while preserving choice.

There may be others, but here is a very simple addon (independently created by a Mozilla contributor) that allows you to set the location bar to the search engine of your desire - unaffected by your current Search bar choice.

In fact after FF18 came out and the bug was still there I just dropped the pointless rage and resigned myself to living with the freeze-ups and just restarting FF every 2 hours or so.  

Previously, the freeze-ups would become longer lasting and occur more frequently the longer FF had been running. After about 4 hours of uptime FF would become pretty much useless, freezing up for 5~7 seconds every 3 minutes or so.

This latest 19.0.2 has been running now for almost 10 hours and I've had ZERO freeze-ups! I'm positively giddy with happiness. :-)

**Having issues?** Before self-posting with your [troubleshooting information](http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Using%20the%20Troubleshooting%20Information%20page), please run through [basic troubleshooting](http://support.mozilla.org/kb/Basic%20Troubleshooting). [SUMO](http://support.mozilla.com/) and [Live Chat](http://support.mozilla.com/chat) are our friends too.

Are your issues consistently reproducible under [Aurora](http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/aurora/) or [Nightly](http://nightly.mozilla.org/)? If you think you've found a bug, [master the art of filing bugs](http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Bug_writing_guidelines) on [Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).

**Keyboard fan?** Check out Firefox's [keyboard shortcuts](http://support.mozilla.com/kb/Keyboard%20shortcuts) or [make your own](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/customizable-shortcuts/).

Do you really like Firefox and the open web? [Get involved](http://www.mozilla.org/contribute/) and [stay informed](http://planet.firefox.com/).

**Firefox Releases (desktop and mobile):**

**Additional information that might be of interest (not part of draft):**

* [Add-on development](http://addons.mozilla.org/developers/) - how to start developing Firefox add-ons

* [Firefox (Desktop) features tracker/wiki](http://wiki.mozilla.org/Features/Desktop)

* [Mozilla Developer Network](http://developer.mozilla.org/) - developer hub for Mozilla/Firefox and web development

* [Mozilla Labs](http://mozillalabs.com/) - experimental ideas

* [Mozilla Hacks](http://hacks.mozilla.org/) - leading edge stuff about Firefox and the open web

~~* [Mozilla Corporation](http://www.mozilla.org/foundation/moco.html) vs [Mozilla Foundation](http://www.mozilla.org/about/)~~

-----------------------

**Things to consider:**

* What else do we want or need in the sidebar?

* Is there too much text in the draft? Too little? Too detailed? Is there a better way to format or categorize the information?

* Do we want to use one of r/firefox's threads on extensions instead of AMO's most popular listing? (I found them to be very similar anyway)

* Do we want people to put something like [support] in their self-post titles when they need help?

I'm not looking for credit or attribution, so let's create the best subreddit sidebar we can ~~in order to appease my perfectionist tendencies~~. :3

EDIT: I've added the different channels of Firefox and striked out the MoCo links. Keep commenting and I'll do my best to incorporate the feedback! 

EDIT2: I've changed the lengthy troubleshooting text to a link to the basic troubleshooting guide on SUMO and added a link to the customizable shortcuts extension.

EDIT3: I've remove the detail on the Firefox channels since their pages provide that information.

**If you have any other ideas on how to shorten or improve the draft, I'm all ears.** [12/30 6:50am CST]",,False,self,t5_2qh4p,True,,,True,t3_nto46,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/nto46/rfirefox_a_new_subreddit_sidebar_draft_included/,

It's becoming really irritating, as it does this when I'm watching videos, just browsing, listening to music, etc.

**Asking for Help**
If you're asking for help, there's a page in Firefox that has lots of useful information for people helping you.  In general, you should include it. The page is about:memory -- save it and post it somewhere (dropbox public is one easy way.  Or [http://pastebin.mozilla.org/](http://pastebin.mozilla.org/))

If your problem is about memory usage, including about:memory?verbose is useful as well -- that shows where Firefox is using it's memory.

**Troubleshooting:**
First, try reading the two pages listed above. Maybe they can point you towards what's wrong.  Make sure your Firefox is up to date -- current is 7.0.1 (or 3.6.23).  

Two places that can introduce problems is your profile (History, bookmarks, form info, etc). Since that's unique to you, problems might not show up for Firefox developers.

Try the [places maintenance addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/places-maintenance/) -- it runs a few things that can fix some problems that can creep in. Especially if you have problems with the interface feeling slow, try this.  

To see if your problem happens in a new profile, try
[creating a new one](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Managing-profiles#w_creating-a-profile) -- Don't worry, your settings aren't lost; they're still in the old one.

There's a page at about:support that has debugging info that might be useful.  More importantly, there's a big ""Reset Firefox"" button on it -- this keeps a bunch of your important settings, but deletes everything else.  Fixes some problems like magic!

Another common debugging technique is disabling addons.  Since Firefox Addons are so powerful, they occasionally cause problems, unfortunately.  [Here's how to test Firefox without addons](https://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Safe%20Mode)

I hope this can help you get better help!

I made a self post, because I'm really not here for karma.

I did an overhaul of the current default homepage of Firefox. I thought it was not really in the theme of Firefox nor attractive, so I thought ""Fuck this, I'm doing this live."" So I tried to make something that would be recognized instantly as a Firefox homepage. Something that newcomers would appreciate. I'm still new at webdesigning, I only started 1 year ago, so I may be missing something. My ultimate goal is to submit this idea to Mozilla of this homepage.

So if you have changed your homepage and you don't know the adress, it's ""about:home"".

Now the page itself [is here](http://saming.free.fr/fhome/). Oh um, it's in French, because I made this for my mom at first and she doesn't speak English. I didn't realize that could be a problem. Making you guys one.

*EDIT: [here's an English version !](http://saming.free.fr/fhome/en/) I added regular Firefox links.*

Okay, so what do you think ?

**UPDATE:** Okay so I'm trying to enhance the page with your advices, it's [in a subdirectory here](http://saming.free.fr/fhome/test/).

Now, I've seen this stuff a thousand times on employee's computers, but I've never had it on my computer. I got no prompts, no downloads, no UAC, and no weird webpage popups.

I tried googling around but couldn't find any good answers. So how does something like this, just run and install itself from a webpage?


edit: I say I wouldn't believe it, because all the employee's say when I ask what they were doing is 'nothing!' or 'I don't remember', so I always assumed they had run something or installed something and either didn't remember or were embarrassed to admit it.

1341007699.0,20,self.firefox,vtejm,HTML5 localStorage - A new kind of hidden super-cookie!,,27,7,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/vtejm/html5_localstorage_a_new_kind_of_hidden/,"As you already know Firefox (since 3.5) supports HTML5 [localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage#localStorage). This allows web pages to save data persistently in your browser profile not unlike cookies. For example [BrowserQuest](http://browserquest.mozilla.org/) uses localStorage to save your progress. Unfortunately the current implementation of localStorage in Firefox raises some privacy concerns.


**You can't see in the current Firefox UI which sites are using localStorage**
You can open the Web Console, type localStorage and see if the site you are currently viewing is using localStorage but you can't see in a list all the sites that are using it, like you can with cookies. There is a bug filled to [present localStorage as cookie in the same UI](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=506692) and [DOM storage management interfaces](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=343163). Also you can install the [Foundstone HTML5 Local Storage Explorer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/foundstone-html5-local-storage/) add-on to see all the sites but really this is something that should be included in Firefox.


**localStorage does not obey the third-party cookies preference**
You may not allow third-party sites to set cookies but these sites can use localStorage and effectively override your preference. If you install the add-on I mentioned above I am sure you will find many sites that are using localStorage and you may have never visited them directly. Again there is a bug filled: [localStorage does not obey ""third-party cookies"" pref](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=536509).


**You can't easily clear localStorage data from the current Firefox UI**
The only way right now to clear localStorage from inside Firefox is to clear your cookies from ""Clear Recent History…"" with time range set to everything. Any other way won't clear you localStorage! Alternatively you can use the add-on I mentioned before or delete the [Webappsstore.sqlite](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Webappsstore.sqlite) file from your profile after you have closed Firefox. Again there is a bug: [DOM Storage (localStorage, sessionStorage) data is not cleared when ""Clear Recent History"" is used with Time range not ""Everything""](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=527667)


These bugs were filled in 2009. Also Mozilla is aware of these and other [issues with localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage#Storage_location_and_clearing_the_data). In my opinion localStorage in Firefox is a new kind of hidden super-cookie that goes largely unnoticed. I am writing this post to raise awareness to this issue and provide some workarounds to keep track of your localStorage. Since Firefox has already implemented the Do-not-track feature to provide options to protect users' privacy I think it's important for these bugs to get fixed.

1. How much has changed? Is it as fast as Chrome , sleek and all that?

2. How stable are add-ons. It used to be that you would have to worry about them updating or Firefox updating and then the whole browser breaking. I only plan to use &lt;15 (mostly privacy / security extensions) so I should be alright?

3. Is it stable in general... I hear it's pretty good as long as you don't pack on all the extensions. Like I said I won't have many.
