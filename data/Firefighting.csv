Seeing a dad put that much effort into making his kid happy is awesome and anyone that awesome deserves to be showered in patches. 

So if you agree, here is the address the father gave me to send patches, (or anything else you guys wanted to send) to. 



This is the address to his counties volunteer fire services coordinator. Op wanted it this way so his personal information wasn't posted.

Send the patches over to:

Vicki Price

410 south SR 19

Palatka, Fl

32177


Thanks in advance guys and girls.

I see a lot of potential and know it will grow and become great. 

One thing that can derail r/firefighting is a career vs volunteer mentality. I have seen it in other forums first hand. Guys bickering, passive aggressive comments, and over all stupid comments from people hiding behind their keyboard. Whatever is your viewpoint on the subject, just keep it to yourself. 

If you are going post a critique on something don't say ""stupid vollies, never grabbed a plug so they lost water and  the house"" or ""cocky career guys, smashed every window in that place."" Keep that stuff to yourself, it has no place here and will never be of value. 

Instead if you are going to make a comment, back it up with your reasoning, or ask questions that will foster constructive discussion. 

Every department does things differently. Career, Volunteer, doesn't mean yours or mine does it better. One thing for sure is every single fire we have been to is out now. So we have that going for us.

Anytime I see a comment that regarding the career vs volunteer battle, I plan on downvoting on the spot. Keep it positive and constructive gents. Lets learn from each other and grow this into a great resource for the fire service.

1374155151.0,38,self.Firefighting,1ik3ni,Tips for getting hired.,dontbthatguy,45,7,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1ik3ni/tips_for_getting_hired/,"A lot of people come to this sub looking for career advice, and after seeing a job posting here I figured I would share my two cents on getting onto a career dept. Before I start bare in mind I am in the northeast in CT and am sure the process is different state by state and of course by country as well. And let me not forget to say that this isn't gospel and am open for any corrections anyone may have, or tips to add.

1. Get in a position to apply. Many municipalities have requrements. GED/diploma, EMT, CPAT perhaps some FF1 or FF2 (though many times this is not the case up here.)


GED/diploma is an easy one. I mean c'mon man if you don't have a diploma pull a Billy Madison and go back to school. 

EMT is a requirement on many applications. Even if it says EMT needed at application, ask the human resources dept if you can still apply because you plan on getting into an EMT class (then get into a damn class). Many times they will let you test because it only takes 8 months or so start to finish to become an EMT and many Eligibility lists last 2 years. Even if it isn't a requirement, I recommend it. Car accidents and fires have victims and it's a great feeling to know you know what you're doing medically at these scenes. Also it is a plus to be able to mention you are an EMT in the oral interviews.

CPAT is self-explanatory, google it and get your ass in shape. This is the fire service, not the post office. 

FF1/FF2 is in my opinion the last thing to worry about. It's fun to volunteer and is great for experience, but most of the time (in CT) it is not required because they send you to the academy which takes people with no experience and tuns them into fire breathing animals or something like that. 

2. Take every damn test around.

I don't care if you only want a big city, or want to work in your home town, or where your dad works. TAKE EVERY TEST AVAILABLE TO YOU! Taking every test will make you a better test taker. I took 13 cause well, ""I'm not a smart man."" But what happened was I started to see the same written tests WORD FOR WORD! And with repetition I got better at them. Also I started getting much better at oral boards which come later. I was set to even travel for tests with friends that wanted to get hired. 

3. Pay attention and fill out your application fully and neatly. 

My cousin applied to my department and couldn't hand it in so I did it for him. For shits and giggles I thumbed through it to see if it was complete and sure enough it wasn't! Are you kidding me?! This could be the career of your life and you botched the god damned application?! Also Pro tip: Photo copy the filled out application because when it comes time to fill out a different application all the information you need will be right there. (A lot of times they ask for references and I always forgot peoples addresses and numbers so having a photocopy of my last app always helped)

4. Time for the written. Take it seriously.

You can google written test tips. I can't offer much here I always scored in the 80's to start and after taking a few tests, I started to break into the 90's. Brush up on math, read the news paper. The written are usually basic math and reading with some ethical questions. I would love for someone to take the baton here and come up with some solid written tips, 'cause they really weren't my forte. 

5. The oral boards

This really is a post in itself and we should probably do a oral board thread for tips, but these are basically a job interview. Expect the usual questions; strengths/weaknesses, why do you want to be a firefighter, what is your favorite color, ect. Prepare for it! Write out your answers, then turn them into bullet points you want to hit. Then rehearse. In front of a mirror, or in front of friends. My college roommate and I used to just constantly bounce oral board question off each other. It will help. Get a suit. Don't show up unless you are dressed for the occasion or you will look like a moron. Also bring resumes. Even if they cannot accept them, you look like a champ waking in with some resumes prepared to give out. Relax and realize the guys across the table have sat in the same seat you are in. They want to see you do good. Also you deserve to be there. You made it that far so be confident. Again this subject deserves a post in its self so hopefully we can make that happen soon. 

Lastly, just be patient.

Some of you friends may get hired after the first test, some may take years, but keep at it. The day you stop testing and give up is the day the dream is over. That simple. 

Some other things I wanted to say, let family and friends know you are testing. Many times I was told about a test because an aunt said hey I heard dept X was accepting applicants. Also make a support group with others that want to get hired. Take tests together practice and support each other. If you think a dept is going to test, but can't find info, call the HR department of the city. They are usually very helpful. 

That is all I can think of for now ladies and gents. I hope that helps someone out there. Sorry for the wall of text, but I had a coffee and now some pre work out mix so my fingers are going a mile a minute. 

And sorry for any typo's. again I am not a smart man...

fire started inside the local chemical plant and in a blink of an eye it  exploded into massive flames. The alarm went out to all the fire  departments for miles around. When the volunteer fire fighters appeared on the scene, the chemical  company president rushed to the fire chief and said, ""All our secret formulas are in the vault in the center of the plant. They must be saved. I will give $50,000 to the fire department that brings them out intact."" 

But the roaring flames held the firefighters off.   Soon more fire departments had to be called in as the situation became   desperate. As the firemen arrived, the president shouted out that the offer was now $100,000 to the fire department who could bring out the  company's secret files.   

From a distance, a lone siren was heard as another fire truck came into sight. It was the nearby Cajun Hackberry Rural Township Volunteer Fire Company, composed mainly of Cajuns over the age of 65. To everyone's amazement, that little run-down fire engine roared right past all the  newer sleek engines that were parked outside the plant. Without even slowing down, it drove straight into the middle of the inferno. Outside, the other firemen watched as the Hackberry old timers jumped off right in the middle of the fire and fought it back on all sides. It was a  performance and effort never seen before. Within a short time, the Cajun old timers had extinguished the fire and  had saved the secret formulas. 

The grateful chemical company president  announced that for such a superhuman feat he was upping the reward to  $200,000, and walked over to personally thank each of the brave fire fighters. The local KPLC TV news reporter rushed in to capture the  event on  film, asking the chief, ""What are you going to with all that money?""

""Whall,"" said Boudreaux, the 70-year-old fire chief, ""Da first ting we  gonna do is fix dem brakes on dat damn truck!""  ",,False,self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,t3_1k2ie4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1k2ie4/just_a_quick_joke_from_a_friend_in_louisiana/,

It doesn't really affect a lot of us in terms of what we see.  Some of us never even really think about how dangerous our jobs are, even when you're told over and over in training.  Most of us just ignore that ping of fear and charge in.

In a way I am writing this post to simply get things off of my chest, and to be among a community that knows what I am talking about.

Today's call started off like any other call for our FD.  It's that time of the year that a lot of us rural volunteer departments love to hate, and hate to love.  The initial page was for a brush fire on the outskirts of town.  Nothing too serious, I considered ignoring it since I had just finished mowing the lawn and wanted to cool off.  If it started to get too crazy I would go, but, that's when I heard what a lot dread.  Turns out this was no ordinary brush fire.  It was a brush fire that was caused from a structure igniting.  The home was abandoned and the surrounding area overgrown.  So, I knew shit was getting real.

Fast forward to the scene.  We had managed to knock the fire out, and was for the most part mopping up, and knocking out hotspots.  I was hanging out by our tanker cooling down when the whole scene went crazy.  A friend ran out and told me to grab the stokes basket off of the back of our Polaris Ranger and to follow him while he grabbed the medic bag.  Upon arriving I now saw what had gotten so many worked up.  Laying on the ground next to a rather large limb was one of our own.  That branch on the ground next to him had fallen from an internally burning tree and hit him in the head.  

After a few intense hours of worry our assistant chief reported in on his condition.  He suffered a fracture in his C2, and numerous second degree burns on his arms, back, and chest.  

I'm sure some of us have had men down, some even killed in the line of duty.  This was my first time for one of our own to go down.  It really does hit home when it happens.  For those of you that are praying men.  Say a few for him if you would.

**Edit** Thanks for all of your kind words guys.  I got a call from the asst chief with an update.  He's doing good.  They had him up walking around a bit yesterday, and all is going good for him.  There's even talk of a chance he might get to go home some time today or in the next couple of days.",,False,self,t5_2ray9,1373659987.0,,,True,t3_1i1xul,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1i1xul/you_never_think_about_the_danger_until_it_hits/,

My wife and I moved into our apartment when this complex was completed early last year. We feel safe because the building is up to the latest standards for security, fire, etc., and is restricted to senior citizens.

Recently an overloaded circuit ignited a fire in one of the third-floor units. It was almost midnight when the alarms sounded, and you can imagine the problems that arose.

Many residents are physically challenged — some wheel-chair dependent, others reliant on walkers and canes.

A full evacuation was mandated, and here is where the first responders came to the rescue. The fire departments from Charleston and St. Andrews arrived en masse, as did the Charleston Police Department.

The men and women of these departments went to each unit to ensure that all were out and safe. Many people needed to be carried, and all were accompanied to safety in the garage below.

I am a former U.S. Marine, and appreciate order and discipline. That night I was in awe of the men and women of the fire department and police department. The fire chief had the residents gathered together in safe areas, and they were told about the “chain of command.”

What could have been an organizational disaster was an “orderly inconvenience.” I cannot say enough about these brave, dedicated first responders. Too often we take them for granted, but instead we should salute them as we salute our men and women in military service.

I remember being in Kindergarten when the Fire Department put on a Fire Safety Assembly at my school. Being a young impressionable kid, I was quite impressed. I wanted to become a Firefighter when I grew up. Of course, being raised very traditionally it wasn't “OK” for me to want to become a Firefighter, so I kept my dream to myself. Fast forward to when I'm 12, taking care of my mother full time with no other family in the state. I saw all the EMTs and FFs a couple times a month in my town because of how sick my mom was. Pretty much on a first name basis with them. Saved my mom's life more times than I can count by quick smart thinking. Although its thanks to the Forest Grove FD and the EMTs for taking over when they got there.

Fast forward years later  thinking all those years ago of wanting to become a Firefighter, I do my research and start working out. Then I got cancer. Hodgkins Lymphoma. One of those inoperable tumors almost as large as my heart in my lungs. Its all dead tissue thanks to my last radiation treatment on Thursday and the 7 months of Chemo I had. But it pretty much dawns on me there's no way in hell anybody in the world wants someone with my medical history to be a firefighter. Right?

Well, even though that door closed for me whenever I see you guys that have a moment to spare, I always make sure to thank them for their work. 

So, thanks for everything! Keep staying awesome!",,False,self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,t3_utzyw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/utzyw/just_want_to_say_thank_you_to_all_of_you_for/,

1370703153.0,26,self.Firefighting,1fxep3,I would like to air a grievance.,dontbthatguy,33,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1fxep3/i_would_like_to_air_a_grievance/,"This past week I took an engine company ops class at our states fire academy. Great class, great cobweb shaker, and for the most part, great people in the class.

My gripe is with guys that walk around like they are the shit and think they are better than everyone else and usually aren't able to back it up with skills and experience. 

Don't get me wrong I like a little cockiness (confidence) and swagger. We do a job people aren't willing to do and that's great. But don't walk around and look down on people. 

Here's why. I was working with a guy my age from a volly dept. He had a slight disability causing guys to not want to pair up with him. I didn't mind, he could still hang, he was just a little slower. While we were working he asked about the spring clamp I had on my gear. He said he used to wear one, but the guys on his volly department made fun of him for it.

I told him to tell who ever made fun of him for that to go fuck themselves. 

When a new guy comes on, that is the time to show him the ropes and bond with him, not form cliques and ostracize him for wearing a piece of equipment that might make yours and his job easier. 

I guess what I am trying to say is I know there are a lot of young guys here and that's great. I am one as well. When new guys come or guys with little experience come around, teach them. And if you are a new guy with little experience, then shut up and learn. Just because your patch says you FF1, or interior certified doesn't give you the ability to walk around like a king and make fun of guys you think you are better than, that's bullshit. Leave that shit at home. Instead be proud. When a new guy isn't picking up the skills as quick, work with him, train with him. I am sure when you first started there was something you sucked at. The brotherhood is earned, but that doesn't mean you have to cast out new guys because you think you are better than them. Make them feel welcome. The time to act cocky and nock someone down a peg or two is when the guy fresh out of FF1 thinks he knows it all. That's when a little tough love to get him back in line is warranted. 

I know I rambled on a bit here, but this kid I worked with had a confidence issue that was made worse by a few assholes on his dept. Truth is I am sure I'd rather go into a burning house with him than some other cocky ass that he works with. Remember if you have to brag about it, you probably aren't all that great at it. 

All I am trying to say is if you are a firefighter, great. Just don't be an asshole about it.

1367467610.0,27,self.Firefighting,1dj5ca,I'm A Terrible Firefighter And A Terrible Leader,invision240,34,7,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1dj5ca/im_a_terrible_firefighter_and_a_terrible_leader/,"I wrote this for a blog post on my website, but I always feel like a dickhead linking my site in here, so I'm going to paste it in this little box and hope that maybe it'll help out someone else.

There.  I’d like it to be known that the headline of this article was pretty hard to write.  The fire service, by it’s very nature, is full of big guys with even bigger egos – some of it justifiably, most of it not.  I’ve routinely thought that I was in the “justified” group when it came to my “fire ego”.  I read more than anyone else I know, I’m always thinking up new ways to train, and then going to do it. I run a damn BLOG on the INTERNET.

I’m what I’ve heard referred to as a 4-10.  That’s someone with 4 years on the job who acts like he’s been here 10.  And damnit if it doesn’t hurt to say that.  The (not)shocking truth is, critical introspection and self study is amazingly important in the fire service.  Sometimes we just get too big for our moustaches,  and I finally realized that I have.

I’ve been in this weird position for the past year or so where I felt like I figured out what I DON’T know, but was comfortable enough in the fact that what I DO know made me somehow immune from certain things, with one example I’ll dig into specifically.

We were training at a class A burn building – basically a concrete structure with big barrels full of hay and wood that get set on fire, then everyone runs in and puts it out.  There are of course dummies hidden in the structure for the search team to grab, and the occasional “MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY” that comes across the radio when an instructor grabs a student and tells them to hit their pass then play dead.  I’m sure some of you can see where this is going, and there’s a chance that it might wind up segueing into another, yet related article where I attempt to justify my complacency, but we’ll see.

For the first few evolutions, I had been the hose captain, trying to manage to get some wet behind the ear’s firefighters to get the job done, which is very similar to herding cats at some points.  One of my firefighters tended to either ignore my orders or just absolutely refuse to do something then go off and do his own thing.  As aggravating as it was, I didn’t have much control over the situation (which brings us to the “I’m a bad leader” part of the story.)

So after dealing with this guy most of the day, I finally turned the reigns over to him and grabbed a hose, waiting on orders.  First order of the day – RIT assignment.  Cool, gotcha. Oh wait, he didn’t tell us to grab tools or anything and now we’re all sitting over here by the door doing nothing.  Did I do the right thing and say “Hey, we need tools!”? No.  I was too wrapped up in the fact that I couldn’t get him to listen to me earlier in the day that I was going to let him flop on his own with no help from me to “see how it feels”.  I’m apparently really vindictive at times.  Of course, after the evolution was complete, it turned into a complete shitstorm focused mainly on the RIT team and our inability to really do anything at all besides stand outside and play grabass. But hey, I wasn’t the leader, no sweat off my back boss. Just following orders.  I was quickly pulled into the instructors office for a pretty good ass-chewing about letting my team fail so miserably.  I had justifications, reasons, excuses, etc etc for DAYS about how it wasn’t my fault even though I was by far the most experienced FF on the team.  ”Just showing him what it feels like when your team doesn’t come through and doesn’t follow orders.”  ”It’s just hay in some barrels in a room that we know like the back of our hand that’s filled with instructors. NOTHING COULD GO WRONG. I HAVE A HARD TIME TAKING THIS SERIOUSLY BECAUSE IT’S SO UNREALISTIC.”

 

Holy shit.  Did those things actually come out of my mouth?  Did I really just justify why I let my team fail by using spite as a reason?  Did I really just say that and IDLH atmosphere complete with fire was SAFE and UNREALISTIC?

The shameful truth is, I did.  If I could go back and shove those words in my mouth, never to speak again, I absolutely would.

I LET MY TEAM FAIL ON PURPOSE TO PROVE A POINT

As I’m sitting here writing this, I’m beyond disgusted with myself.  I know better than to ever do ANY of that.  It’s shocking that when your brain turns off and your ego turns on, you sometimes turn into a complete idiot who forgets about everything the brotherhood stands for.  I mean, sure, some hay in a barrel is no where close to a real structure fire.  That’s an actual fact.  But it doesn’t change anything.  I’ve always been about giving 100% in training and studying in order to make myself a better firefighter, but it caught up with me and I had a 12-year-old temper tantrum melt down that could have possibly gotten someone injured.

I’m changing this.  I’m going to do my damnedest to make sure that I never let myself get to this position ever again.  It’s unacceptable in every way possible.  It wasn’t the ass-chewing that made me open my eyes, it was the coming home and having to lie to myself about reasons why things happened that made me feel disgusted about my actions.

And here’s my final thought on the whole situation – it’s statistically impossible that I’m the only one out there who is going or has gone through this.  In the words of the famous street poet Ice Cube, “Check yoself Befo You Wreck Yoself.”  Are you letting your ego or emotions get in the way of being 100% all the time?  If so, it might be time to sit down and re-evaluate a little.

So what’s next for me?  Leadership classes.  I need to learn how to lead.  I need to re-learn how to be part of a team, no matter what the experience level is.  I need to bring myself back down about 100 notches.  I’m not the badass that I’d love to believe I am.  I am mediocre.  But I refuse to stay like this, and I think that last point is key to becoming a truly great firefighter.

Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/WEVRS

Since 1960, the volunteers of the West End Volunteer Rescue Squad have been there whenever the community needs us, anywhere in Richmond, Virginia. We provide emergency medical services, disaster response, and educate the community in how to save lives. We provide invaluable on-the-job training for countless people who want to pursue careers in medicine, public safety, and a variety of other fields.

Unfortunately, our 52 year legacy of service is close to an end.
As a volunteer organization, we rely on the generous financial support of the community to keep the lights on and the ambulances running. Our donation revenue is down 82% since 2008; our reserves have been depleted, and without your help, our doors may close forever.

In addition to getting this awesome t-shirt designed by one of our members, you'll get the satisfaction of knowing that every single dollar that's donated goes straight into the services we provide.

Please, buy a shirt or make a donation today (http://www.donatetorescue.org)!",,False,self,t5_2ray9,1348452894.0,,,True,t3_10db5m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/10db5m/our_rescue_squad_is_in_danger_of_shutting_down/,

This email was sent by my fire chief, please send to your friends in public safety.
Good Morning
This original request was sent from Sgt. Robert Carpenter - Public Information Officer of the Virginia State Police, Division VI, (I have his phone number) who received a request from another officer that a friend of his who is a life-saving member in Bedford County said that a 6 year old boy from Rustburg, Va is sadly dying of terminal cancer and might not live to see Christmas. His special request is to receive Christmas cards from police officers, firefighters and EMS personnel.
The request then came to Chief James Seavey from Wesley Melson who is a volunteer Chief of Colonial Beach Rescue Squad and a career personal in Va. and then from Chief Seavey to me.
Besides a card, a patch would be a thrilling addition to give to this little boy.
In this time of remembering our blessings and of giving I can think of nothing more appropriate then to give this little boy some happiness and our prayers.
Please quickly send to

I think that creating a centralized website with all of the firefighting's tips, training, and information complied in one place would be extremely beneficial. I've just got a few questions that hopefully you will all be able to help me with.

* Does anybody know of a similar website already built? Obviously there's vententersearch.com, firehouse.com, etc. I mean a wikipedia style site which anybody can edit. 
* When I do make the site operational, what would you like it to be named?
* Do you have any content which you would like to submit?

**EDIT 1:** As far as the name goes, I think it should be short, and also memorable. FFwiki.org, Firefighterwiki.org, Firefightingwiki.org, etc. Thoughts?

It's an experience. Was bound to happen sooner or later, and I knew exactly what I was getting myself into when I signed *that* dotted line years ago. Much of the reason why I did is to help and give back to the community in any way I could. I've been to MVAs before but all were either shaken up drivers or cuts and bruises and slightly damaged vehicles.

The severity of what happened yesterday afternoon didn't really sink in until the last few minutes before arriving on scene. If I'm out the door quick enough, I can meet up with and follow our remunerated urban fire service out for highway incidents (which was the case this afternoon). The highway information board in town was flashing its amber lights and displaying words to the effect of: ""Accident: avoid area"". I was too busy trying to safely negotiate traffic to take much notice of it.

Things started to get interesting when an ambulance tore past myself and the urban fire truck in the same direction. I didn't make our tanker this time, they were just pulling out of the village as I approached from the highway so I followed in my own vehicle.

Then I noticed the very large, thick black plume of smoke rising in the distance. ***Fuck.*** Shit just got real. Followed the tanker past the line of cars backed up and parked safely off the road away from the accident site. Jumped out, grabbed my gear back and legged it towards the accident site, promptly throwing my gear on. Helped where ever I could. Urban Firies were extinguishing the truck which was well alight as well as a few other volunteers from a neighboring brigade whilst we supplied water and other small stuff.

Didn't take much notice of the debris on the road until the adrenaline wore off a bit whilst I was asking our officer for something, then looked to a lump on the road and tried to figure out what it was. Long story short, it was a white sheet event for what very little was left.

I'll spare the more gruesome detail and I hope I haven't bored or annoyed anyone with this reflection. I just want to get this out there amongst fellow firefighters and not bottle it up, which is where things like this become dangerous to oneself. I also wanted to share as it may be of use in reading for those new or wanting to join a volunteer or remunerated service. It is not all glitz and glamor, things do get very nasty. That said, for all of the bad stuff that the pager dishes up, a sense of pride and reward is felt for being able to be there at the worst of times to help restore normality as best you can to those desperately in need.

They say 'firsts' stick with you. First fire, first *lights and sirens* fire, and other trivial little things like that, and I would say something like this definitely will. Don't bottle things up. Do talk to your fellow firefighters. Do take up counseling. It does help.

1365606815.0,18,self.Firefighting,1c2eum,"Hate to be the fart in church.. but isn't the whole ""most dangerous profession"" overplayed.",southfieldron,33,15,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1c2eum/hate_to_be_the_fart_in_church_but_isnt_the_whole/,"Fact is, the public loves us, puts us up on a hero pedestal, and we love to talk about how dangerous our job is.  I think we are getting a bit narcissistic aren't we?    My take on the facts: 

1) We are BELOW the national average of work related deaths (we are 2.5 per 100k, Natl average is 3.5 per 100k.)
2) We are FAR below the most dangerous jobs, fishing is about 50 times more dangerous (121 per 110k ) loggers &amp; pilots are #2. 

3) While there are LODD deaths that are simply accidents and uncontrollable, the majority happen in situations when we do control some of the risk factors.   In other words if we were fitter we would have less Cardiac deaths, if we drove smarter we would have far less traffic deaths.    That is not to say there are deaths in those 2 categories that occur in spite of best efforts to be smart, but I am looking at overall number, not anecdotal incidents.

I am not belittling our bravery, or our collective heroism of being willing to put our lives on the line to save others.  The fire service history is sadly riddled with deaths of good men and women who were simply doing their job, and were heros who died helping others.  But we do have a dirty little secret... a lot of our deaths are from our own stupidity.   I guess what bothers me is elevating ourselves above tow truck drivers, who are left sweeping up the mess after our extracation, without the benefit of a flashered up blocker truck protecting him... not loving his job.. or getting the benefit of the public adoration..  but he still goes to work every day, doing a job more dangerous than ours,  simply because he needs to provide for his family.   We are no better men than they..

Everyone always says, ""We'll get them out!"", but not many people really talk about how. I've been fortunate to have been stationed with two **very** technical rescue and fire rescue oriented Lieutenants over the last year, who have taught me more in my last year than I learned in the 3 before it. Everybody learned the NFPA/NPQ/IFSAC ways of doing this and that when going through fire school, but let's be honest, most of that shit is timely and inefficient. So I'd like to share some of the things I've been learning with everyone, with the hope that one day it may help one of you get a brother or sister in need out.

We've been doing this training every shift, I'll try and post weekly or biweekly updates of new things if this thread is well received, but I can't promise to keep up regularity just due to real life stuff. I also don't have any photos because 1. I'm busy actually learning the training, and 2. I'm paranoid about posting personally identifiable information on the internet. Sorry.

Ok. Let's start from the beginning.

My Lt and I are inside a building fighting fire. A burning truss falls out of the roof, and knocks his big ass unconscious. I'm a 220 pound 6 foot tall firefighting fit guy (Not a calendar guy, I can muscle fuck some weight around though), and he's a 240 pound 5 foot 8 inches guy. So with his gear and BA, I'm looking at 300 pounds of dead weight that just hit the floor. What do you do?

First thing's first, check and see if he's alright. Don't do a 2 minute patient assessment, just 5 seconds to size up the situation. Maybe he just fell and he's fine. But for the sake of this scenario, he's not. Things to check include his mask seal, do you hear air leaking from his face piece, how much air does he have, is there something on top of him you'll need help or equipment to get off of him, is there anything impeding you from dragging him. Next thing to do is call a mayday. There's a few important things to think about here. When we take our PASS tags to IC at an incident, it's got our individual names on there. I know most places preach to not ever use names on the radio, but in this situation, do it. The IC needs to know who specifically went down, in case something happens to you or another crew somewhere else. Next, describe your location. If you know you're in the family room, great. But if you don't, there's still clues that can be very useful to the RIT guys coming to help you. Are you on a carpet floor? A tile floor? Did the last door you went through swing towards you, or away from you? Are you against a brick wall, an interior drywall, do you see a residential ceiling above you, or does the vaulted ceiling fade away into the smoke? If you tell me you're in a room with carpeted floors and you swung the door in to the room you're in now, I'm not going to waste my time on hardwood/tile/etc floors, and with doors that open towards me when I try them.

So you've radio'ed your mayday, **""Mayday mayday mayday! This is Chris on Engine 1, I'm in an interior room with Bill who just got knocked out. I don't know where the room is, but it has carpeted floors, and I swung the door into the room to get in here. He's got 2,000 pounds of air left, but his face piece is cracked.""**. It's **very important** to tell them ""**I'll be attempting rescue**"" versus ""**I'll be finding a safe place in the room to await rescue**."" That will give RIT and IC enough to get an idea of where to find you. **Now** that you've given your radio report, activate your PASS alarms on both your and the downed firefighter's pack. Giving a radio report with a blaring PASS in the background is a son of a bitch.

If he's got a flashlight, make sure it's on. If safely possible (The middle of the room isn't burning like dog shit (If it is, you should move to another room)), stretch him out to the largest profile possible. Regardless of if you're performing the rescue, or you're waiting on additional man power, you can go ahead and put him in an SCBA harness. An SCBA harness follows these specific steps:

1. Grab the waist band of the SCBA. Do not let go, assume that if you let go at any point, you lose the strap in your hand. Slide your hands to the sides and loosen them up as much as possible.

2. Slide your hands back to the middle and unbuckle the waist strap.

3. Run one strap through the middle of the downed firefighter's legs, and the other around the outside of his leg. Do not let go of either strap. You may have to hike the leg up to get the straps to reach. Buckle them together.

This will give you a make shift harness, encapsulating more of the body than the SCBA does regularly. Now, if you have a pike pole or sheet rock puller, you can run the handle diagonally from his shoulder strap to that waist strap and have a make shift way to lift and carry the downed firefighter.

Let's say there's a window you can get to, and you're able to muscle fuck the dead weight to it. First, get a ladder. Call for one to be thrown if you need it, and if not, make sure you know what you're about to drop your guy onto. Next, consider ways to get your guy out the window. Have a pike pole or a sheet rock puller? You can hook the working end of the tool on the window sill and set the handle on the ground, creating a make shift ramp. Slide the center of the downed firefighter's body (face down) as much onto the tool as possible, then pick up the handle and use the tool as a fulcrum to slide him out the window. It'll be uncomfortable, but it works if they're too heavy for you to just pick up. You may just be able to slide them to the window, and stand them up. To do that, put them face down and head towards the window. You want to start by grabbing under the shoulders, and bending them at the knees, then sliding them against the window again. As this point, they're bent at the knees, body shaped like an L, and their chest is against the window wall. Now, grab by the waist and lift into the window. The body will naturally bend forward at the waist, so once you get the torso through, they will bend out of the window rather than bend back into the building.

Let's say you're in a residential single story single family house, in a room with no exterior windows or doors. It's good common knowledge to know that studs are built 16 inches apart. You don't even need a tool, you can use your boot, to kick through some sheet rock into an adjoining room. And any firefighter worth just about anything can fit between those two studs. If you kick through and find a room on the other side, look for an exterior door or window. If you find a hard wall you can't get through, you know you've likely got an exterior wall without any windows or anything. See if you can make a purchase hole with an axe or halligan in the wall, so that guys outside might find it and cut or break the wall open for you to egress through.

Next, let's talk about air. A firefighter should never die with air in their bottle. Here's a way you can take a 30 minute bottle, and make it last an hour:

* Get comfy on the floor. You're going to want to move as little as possible. Slow your breathing as much as consciously possible.
* Take your pack off, and slide it in front of you onto your lap.
* Turn your air off at the bottle. Take slow half-breaths, and hold them as long as you can. Repeat until you suck mask. Turn the bottle back on the refill the line with air, turn the bottle back off, and repeat. 

My Lt waits until I've been working out and am dog ass tired, then comes at me with a pack and a bottle with 1,800 pounds of air in a 30 minute bottle, and has me do this to see how long I could make it last. I've gotten 18 minutes out of it.

Last thing I want to bring up in this post is ladders. Forget everything NFPA/NPQ/IFSAC taught you about throwing ladders, because when it's my ass on fire hanging out of a 3rd story window, you'd better have that shit thrown up ASAP.

For extension ladders, **know the bedded length of the ladder, and the number of inches each ""click"" of going up one gives you**. Write it on the ladder in sharpie if you have to. My engine has a 24 foot extension ladder, the bedded length is 14 feet, and each ""click"" is 14 inches. When approaching a building, the butt man should always be in charge of ladder placement. As you approach, size up your height and any overhead obstructions. How tall are you? I'm 6 feet tall. If I stood against that wall, it would take a little over 2 of me to reach that window. I'll call it 15 feet off the ground. My butt needs to be about 1/4^th the height of where I'm going. So my butt needs to be about 4 feet off the building. Bam, thrown down my butt once, it doesn't get moved again. Stand the ladder up. I know I needed 1 click to get from 14 feet to a little over 15, and for every 2 feet of distance from the building to the butt, I'll do 1 click. So 4 feet means 2 clicks. Alright, grab my rope and pull my ladder up 3 clicks, drop that bastard against the wall. Bam, right where I need it to be. Too short? Yank it up another click. Too long? Grab the butt and pull it away from the building. It's better to come out too tall than too short. Too far to the left or right? Roll that bitch. Stand to the side, and literally roll it, so that the fly goes in towards the building, and then back out again. Those ladders are made and tested to be tough, they can take a beating.

Sorry for the wall of text, but I think this is important real life shit that more people should think more about. And more then just reading it, if you can, take it to your station and train with it. Please feel free to throw in and contribute your own thoughts/experiences/methods here, if nothing else, I'd like to take them back to my crew to train with.",,False,self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,t3_1jojv9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1jojv9/lets_talk_about_rit_training/,

Also my first day jumping to rescue truck (we peel one off the engine when we aren't fully staffed because of holiday, vacation or sick leave) and had to go recover a badly decomposed body in the *nice, hot* sun (96 degrees, yay!) again wearing class B and SCBA.

Couple minutes pass and we get called and start heading over to what we now know is a ripper. We're about 3 blocks over and 2 blocks down from the address and there's a group of about 5-10 people waving us down telling us an abandoned house is on fire! We pull over and radio battalion asking if we should check it out, get the ok and do a quick 360 and assume the smoke detectors were being set off by the current structure fire's smoke that we're heading to. Last second I see the side door open and poke my head in and see a couple small fires in the front room!!! I yell to my captain and we hurry up and put the fire out. 


We then proceed to get back on the piece and go to the original fire and help out there. We were all really surprised that it happened and were happy that we took that street because we definitely prevented that house from turning into an actual structure fire. The senior guy on my piece said ""that was definitely a first.""  


So there's my story, you guys have any good ones? ",,False,self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,t3_1gc75n,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1gc75n/whats_the_most_surprising_thing_thats_ever/,

I started the academy on Monday and I am currently in an 8 week course, with 2 weeks of hazmat training later. 8 weeks may seem crazy short, but we're training all week and our department is already short guys with a large number retiring in Feb so they need us asap. 

I'm working in Atlantic City, which is kind of big compared to a lot of you guys here on this subreddit I'd imagine. Our class size is 13 and I had scored 1st non veteran on our civil service test that we took a while back. We put our applications in may of 2010, and took the test in september, so as you can see this was a LONG hiring process for me but I'm insanely glad it finally went through. 

I've had all sorts of public safety jobs similar to firefighting. I was a ski patroller up in Vermont, and I've been an ocean lifeguard in AC for the past six years. I can relate to everything our instructors have already said about the way things go in the system and responding situations. Obviously I'm aware that this is a big step forward. This is now my career. I am honored. 

We got our turnout gear tuesday that we'll use until we graduate and get custom fitted gear and whatnot. Today we went to station 2 and don and doffed our gear a bunch of times trying to get everyone under 50 seconds without our masks. 

Sorry for blabbing, I'm just excited to have this as my career, as I've been waiting for it for quite a while. I'm proud to now call the rest of you my brothers and sisters whether you're a volunteer or you're a paid fireman.

 I've been involved with my local volunteer department for around 6 months. Not that long, but I am HOOKED. I have been catching a lot of flack from the wife over it. We are recently married, however dated for 5 years before getting married, so obviously she has been involved in my life longer than firefighting has. It is something that I have always wanted to get involved in however, due to my previous job, I was out of town a lot.

 I absolutely LOVE being involved with the department, as I love to help people. Obviously I love my wife as well, however she has fought me tooth and nail over this from the get go. Every time I think she is starting to come around to the idea, the next meeting night (Tuesdays) we are arguing over it again. I try to see her side of the argument, that it interferes with family time, but I can only see it as her being selfish. I have my training/business meetings once a week in the evenings, and the occasional calls that I am able to make outside of my work schedule. I would love to get her involved with the department so she can understand things better, but she has no desire to do so. I can however understand that she herself is busy as well. My wife is a full time college student, works part time, and we also have a 2 year old that keeps us on our toes. Due to me being the primary income provider and working crazy hours she does end up taking care of our daughter more than I, and I'm thinking this MAY be where her issue is with me taking off to the department. Its not like the balance is largely off Kilt, though. 

 Has anyone else experienced anything similar? How did you work things out? I've asked around my department, and no one has really been able to give me any advice. Most of the other guys either have wives in the department, or their other halves are supportive and proud of what they do.",,False,self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,t3_15ss1h,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/15ss1h/volunteer_having_trouble_with_wife_understanding/,

All volunteer department.  I have a little more than 2 years in the department, and just met the qualification for Lt. He has been in the department for about 7 years and been captain for the last 2.  

There were five people nominated for the Lt position and  prior/existing Fire Lt had received majority of the votes but was elected in as another officer, I was the second majority and won the position.

After the meeting/elections the Fire captain took me aside and proceeded to curse me out for about 5 minutes. Saying he will do everything in his power to destroy me. Sabotage me.  He said he does not believe I can lead the members. He believes I am incompetent. He said that if I don't leave in three months that he will leave in three months. I am really toning down what he said and the aggressiveness and the F bombs, and the flat out ""F you"". Now I am worried about the quality of Response, Drills, Morale and overall keeping things maintained.

My first instinct is that I would like to inform  the Assist Chief, saying that I was told I would be sabotaged and would like a fair chance to explain myself in the event the Chief or Asst Chief ""hears"" anything.

I've been a member of the Fire Service for just about three years; in that time, I've received my level one, been on scene for multiple structure fires (and one HOLY SHIT barn fire) and spent many, many hours on the highway.

Two weekends ago, we responded to a trash pile fire, near the barn that was the HOLY SHIT fire. (Actually, it was the remains of the barn)

It was big, it was hot, and we started to attack it.

Allow me to Tarantino it a bit, and go back to before the fire; during our open house that was the same day.

Our Deputy chief had laid into the beers after we wrapped it up (around 4:30) and continued to do so all the way up until we went out for supper at a local restaurant (8:30-9:30ish)

One of our lieutenants was driving the now quite-intoxicated deputy chief home, when a brush fire was called in.

Myself, and another lieutenant responded on our Alpha unit Engine, and one of our captains joined us on the line. (It was just the three of us on scene for manpower)

[Also worth note; the fire was visible from our station, which is a 2 minute drive away. And our Chief had stood down mutual aid.]

There, we discovered that the deputy chief was on scene. (First alarm)

When our captain tried to get our Deputy to stop sending foam to the line, our deputy constantly responded ""Yeah! Your foams on the way!"" and he was acting quite belligerently.

We attacked the fire, all while having a deputy within earshot that was noticeably drunk. 

Our chief then arrived on scene. Our captain pointed out our deputy, and asked him if he was going to do anything about it. Our chief took no action (Second alarm)

From there, we ran out of water. (Because they had stood down mutual aid)

Our Deputy was then being ridiculously belligerent, yelling, and being incredibly unprofessional. 

At this point in time, myself, alongside my deputy and Captain walked off the scene for our own safety. 

I say our own safety because;

1- It was clear that the chief had no control over the scene anymore
2- The deputy chief was still prevalent on the radio, and was not removed from the scene
3- Our chief failed to make the steps necessary to ensure his crew's safety.

 
I will own up to walking off a scene; that was ill-advised. But at the moment, I felt it necessary.

After we had left the scene (The heresay I received, was that our Deputy then ran the pump.) a fire fighter was taken from the scene in an ambulance due to injuries received at the fire ground. (Also worth note, that the other man on the line with him, was also drunk.)

Today, I received my notice of suspension for one year. 

I don't think the residents of my county are safe with the current chief and deputy; they actively condone drinking on the fire scene, and refuse to take action against it.

I want to know what I can do to get an investigation done into the matter.

My lieutenant and captain were also dismissed.

**TL;DR:** Drunk Deputy Chief on scene. Chief refuses to remove him. Deputy runs pump - fire fighter gets injured. My crew dismissed from the department for walking off of the scene.

The public thinks we sit around the station all day eating and watching TV. Some of these responses basically back that up! 

&gt;They are sitting on station, waiting for calls.
&gt;They're probably being paid anyway
&gt;if those firefighters are full time, they are getting paid whether or not they're saving cats

All these comments underrate the importance of our job. It makes it seem like we have nothing else to do. Shame on you.

We do fire inspections on homes, businesses and care facilities. We do public education with schools, civic groups and businesses. We monitor fire drills and evacuation drills. We train on apparatus and medical equipment. We check our trucks and equipment to make sure everything works properly. We clean our station and gear. We work with student firefighters to get them ready for a career in the fire service. We train with our volunteer force so they are ready for the big calls. I am sure I have missed many things. The public needs to be educated about ALL the aspects of our job and how it helps them to stay safe. 

Never EVER should you, as fellow firefighters talk down about the job. Yes we do have downtime, and once in a while actually get to relax a bit. WE DESERVE IT and we need it. 

When working with new people, I always stress how to improve our public image. 

For example - Mr. Public asks 'Any calls today'? Old answer ~~'No, nothing'. ~~ New answer - No calls, but we have been out all day training. Simple changes that make a difference. Especially when your department need something. *stepping down off my soapbox*",,False,self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,t3_1cjpv0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1cjpv0/a_small_but_i_think_important_rant/,

1357516617.0,16,self.Firefighting,1635oo,Why I became a Firefighter...,spacitymedic,23,7,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1635oo/why_i_became_a_firefighter/,"When joined the fire department in 2011, I'm really not sure what I was looking for. Career advancement? Camaraderie? A sense of purpose? I don't know. In fact, I hated firefighters since I was around the age of 4. 

When my house burned on a year that my dad hadn't paid our dues, the local fire department (not the one I joined) came out, dropped suction into the pond, filled their trucks, charged the lines, and then checked to see if we were on the roster. We weren't. That night, I watched my father stand at the end of the driveway, tears pouring down his face, illuminated by the glow of the 2000 square foot bonfire. I watched the only home I knew go up in smoke because the firefighters refused to help. And I never respected a firefighter after that.

That is, until I visited Local Combination Fire Department.

I had been an EMT since 2007 and didn't feel like I was doing enough by working in the emergency department at Local Hospital. So my friend Jason suggested that I see about becoming a first responder. I went down to the station on their meeting night and ran into my friend who introduced me to Chief. He was excited to have an EMT who was eager to participate and answer medical calls in the area, and I was glad to do it. And then he said I would attend classes and get training on how to fight fire. 

Uhm...no. I'm not a firefighter, I am an EMT. Somehow I guess I thought that firefighters were beneath me and I couldn't possibly stoop to their level. But in order to be a part of the team, I had to play by company rules. Engine company rules. Chief said he would have to special order me some new turnouts since I was much taller than even most of the guys there. So, I received my radio and my trauma bag. I was given an o2 tank and all the airway supplies I would need for any sort of respiratory or cardiac call. I was ready to go.

That night after the meeting, I took a ride to my buddy's house to hang out and have a beer. But on the way, his radio got a tone. ""Boooooooooooooop Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep. Central Dispatch to Local Combination Fire Department. We have report of a brush fire on the corner of Central Avenue and Anderson Road. There are structures in the area and caller says the fire is close to a large propane tank.""

Quickly, we whipped around and drove back to the station, since Jason was a driver/operator. Chief got on the radio and confirmed the address and nature of the tone, and then began dispatching drivers to the trucks. Jason was his go-to-guy since he lived so close to station 2. Everyone had their routine and everyone stuck to protocol. It was organized and structured. No one just jumped on lights and sirens and broke the speed limit. There was no confusion as to what your job was because everyone followed their leader. When Chief spoke, everyone listened.

Jason was told to pick up the Brush Truck 3 and get a size up on the fire. My heart was racing, listening to drivers and firefighters check in on the radio. ""222 responding."" ""Copy, 222 responding."" We hopped in and turned on the lights and sirens, and carefully, but quickly, made our way to the fire. The way the inside of the cab was illuminated with red and filled with the piercing whine of the siren made me sweat. I didn't really know what to expect. The last fire I had ever seen took away from me everything a 4 year old would hold dear, aside from family. I just sort of fell into this situation and there was no way I could have prepared mentally for it.

When we arrived, Jason checked us on scene and ordered me to get out of the truck and help him. Help how?! My friend didn't talk to me like Jason anymore. He was Firefighter 222. Station 2 Lieutenant. Assistant adjunct instructor for the Fire Academy. Driver/operator and Nationally Certified Firefighter II. He was an extension of the apparatus he was manning. And he executed each task with the skill of a seasoned veteran. 

I, however, stood there like a dazed little girl at the side of the truck, watching flames creep up the sides and tops of heavy brush and crunchy June leaves. My mouth open, and eyes wide, I was slightly frozen there in the midst of so much chaos. Bystanders were gathering to watch Engine 3 roll up and attach to the hydrant. Cars were slowing down at the intersection to rubberneck at the scene. So much was going on all at once and I had no idea what to do.

""Desiree! Desiree!,"" Jason yelled at me and snapped me out of my daze. He'd put on his wildland turnouts and started the pump on the truck. ""Feed me hose, okay? And let me know when I get to a quarter tank!"" And with that, he marched headlong into the fire, blasting the brush with a full fog. It crackled and popped. Some of it roared. I stood there, pulling the hose off the reel and walking it down towards him, keeping as far a distance as possible from anything that looked hot, smokey, red, orange, or just plain dirty. 

The thought of a propane tank no less than 30 feet away from me scared me to death, but I figured they wouldn't have me here if it was unsafe... right? Wait a minute.... these guys deliberately go into burning buildings. Maybe their judgement on what is safe or not safe isn't exactly what I had in mind. But, I was in good hands, I would later realize. 

That night, I participated in the first of many events that would forever change my life. Fighting fire was for me. All my preconceived notions about firefighters and what they did, were wrong. They weren't adrenaline junkie hillbillies who just wanted to wear the uniform and get praise. They weren't monsters who allowed your things to burn because you didn't pay your $60.00 that year. And they weren't heroes on a pedestal, either. Not untouchable noblemen who wore medals everyday and marched to the sound of Glory Glory Hallelujah. 

These ordinary men, the guys next door- they were my brothers. 

Now, it took a while before I could see any of that. I was new and I didn't really understand how things worked around a fire house. You hear about these guys who would die for each other, and I didn't see how any of them would do that for me. I learned that in order to be trusted, you have to prove yourself. You have to show up early and leave late. You have to do the dirty work. And not only do it, you have to do it without being asked. You have to go that extra mile, roll a hundred hoses, cook a few meals and wash a few dozen turnouts. You have to clean up what's not yours and take a little bit of crap from the guys around you. What's more- you have to dish out too. And that's just around the firehouse. 

When it really hits the fan, these guys need to know they can trust you, that you're not going to drop the line behind them and leave them alone in a fire. You have to be mentally prepared and physically strong. You have to carry your own weight, and God forbid, carry theirs too. You have to be that hand on their back and swallow any fear you have. Keep it down deep in your gut till it's over because the love you have for your brothers every day... is greater than the fear you have right now. 

I earned my place. And looking back at that first fire, I can understand why they were none too thrilled about making conversation with the new girl, standing around the fire hydrant as they filled the trucks. Many will come and many will go. And that is perfectly alright. But they weren't going to invest in someone who would just take from them and leave. I get it now. And I have the utmost respect for the men on my fire department. 

Together we have been through a lot. We have buried one of our own in 2012. The heaviest weight I will carry is not the casket, but the weight in my heart from losing a brother, a friend. Some of my guys have even saved my own life, for which I am forever in their debt. ""Thank you"" simply won't cut it. So, today, I write to tell you about the men who changed my way of thinking. How they proved themselves to be exactly nothing like what I thought. And how I decided I wanted to be like them, more than anything in the world.

God Bless all my Firefighter Brothers and Sisters. Be safe. Trust each other. And fight the good fight. I love you.

I am a South African (Western Cape) and I'm interested in the fire department. I have a feeling it would suit me quite well, but figured I would ask around here first to get your take on what it is to be a fire fighter. 
Presumably responses from South African fire fighters would be more relevant and helpful, but obviously any input from anyone will be great.
I'm interested in anything you have to say about profession and the life, but any descriptions of the following would really help. 
Day to day (when not out fighting a fire)
The assessment (physical, education)
What makes a good fire fighter and what skills are beneficial?

Recently, we had a mutual aid call for a structure fire. One of our members (a 19 year old that has been on our fire department for four years and started out as a junior firefighter) sat on the bumper of our first due engine (Second due engine for the incident).

When we returned from the call, the Engineer reprimanded this person for not doing anything, when any pair of hands working could be useful. The firefighter went and complained to the chief and now the chief is going to give a ""sensitivity speech"" to all of our members. 

She will often ""hide"" (for lack of a better term) when she is at the station when calls come in. 

The firefighter is also notorious for making posts on Facebook about how much of an assistance to the community she is, and regularly takes photos of herself in her gear every time she dons it. Many members get annoyed about her flaunt it attitude.

I understand that none of you know our situation, and opinions on it will be biased due to how I convey this message. Also I could do a better job at wording everything, so sorry about that.

Unfortunately I decided to follow the poor directions on the popcorn package tonight and chaos soon ensued. It said to place 1/4 cup of oil in a pot along with one kernel of popcorn, then cover, then wait for that kernel to pop before adding the remaining popcorn. As I was waiting for the initial kernel to pop, I noticed the pot started to smoke so I removed the lid and then BAM: the hot oil had been craving oxygen so up she went up in flames as soon as I removed the lid. In a panic, I did the worst thing ever and picked up the pot and tried to blow out the flame. Boom! Mega fireball in the kitchen as beard hair, eyebrow hair, eyelid hair all got singed. At this point, having received a fireball in the face, I decided to drop the still flaming pot while I looked for a cloth to put over it. This did the trick and the fire was out. 

Anyway, even knowing that oxygen + fire = bad, I panicked under the circumstances and did the wrong thing. I thought for sure the house was going to burn down as I watched a flaming pot fly through the air towards the cupboards. Luckily I got it out and everything is fine now except my face -- that's been in a bowl of ice water for the past couple of hours. Lots of nasty smells but I don't think it will blister or scar.

So to you firefighters out there, tell your mates to watch out when making popcorn and don't fuck with hot oil. Holy shit this was a scary night. Also, as firefighters do you think these instructions are pretty stupid for making popcorn? Does it make sense to heat up a covered pot of oil while waiting for a single kernel to pop?

I wake myself up, get the gear on and head to the hall. Once we get enough manpower that i'm comfortable with we head out with a pump and a tank. 

Dispatch tells us that the Key Holder lives across the street and is on scene. We get on scene and I assume command. There was another Captain driving the Tank that said we should just check the panel and reset it and go home. I said, nope, we are here to check the building. I told him if he wants to clear he can go as there was clearly no fire.

So, myself and another firefighter checked the panel and walked the area of trouble with the Key Holder. It took a whole 5 min more. 

I hear this all the time on the radio. Crews showing up and checking the panel then clearing. It defeats the purpose of the fire alarm in my opinion.

What does everyone think? Do you have any examples that I can take back for training that shows the benefit of checking the building?

Sorry if its a stupid question. Just curious what other departments do. ",,False,self,t5_2ray9,1373686202.0,,,True,t3_1i75s1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/1i75s1/what_do_you_guys_do_for_alarm_calls_do_you_ever/,

The secondary method was to connect ~20m x  50mm sections of lay-flat hose together to make up an attack line.  

In most US fire departments, we use preconnected layflat hose.  With 2 FFs, I can have a 60m x 45mm hose stretched, flaked, charged, and ready for entry in under 60 seconds.  

How fast does the rigid hose deploy?  Do you bring loops / slack forward so that the nozzle firefighter can advance without having to move the entire length of deployed hose?  How many men does it take to pull a branch into a house, up the stairs, and back towards the front bedrooms?

If you're familiar with US-style preconnected hose, how does it compare, speed wise?

However, while stationed in Korea, we had an exercise in MOPP 4, meaning completely decked out in chemical warfare gear, SCBA with ridiculous filter attachment, whole other set of CBRN resistant bunker gear underneath ours, just ridiculous. 
I was the driver and parked with a hydrant about 50 feet behind us, the plugman hooked up to the hydrant while I charged the two pulled hand lines at the door.  I glanced at the plugman who gave me a thumbs up and told him to charge it.  Next thing I know, roughly 300 ft of 5 inch charge themselves in the bed.  
I got tunnel vision with my mask and all my uncomfortable gear on and assumed the plugman made the connection rather than checking myself.  It was the only truly negative remark for that whole exercise week.  Donuts for all involved ha.

I ended getting a ride from someone there too, they even offered to pick me up for the next meeting. It felt like a family environment which was exactly what I was looking from it.

About me:  I graduated last summer from college with a BS degree in Biology.  I took environmental coursework/labwork and was also a teaching assistant for an ecology lab.  I recently found out about wildland firefighting and was immediately intrigued.  I've been reading up all about it and figured it is something I REALLY want to do!

I have some questions about requirements and the application process and would really appreciate if anyone could help me out.

1. I know it's late in the season for applications (USAJobs position closing is 3/29) how stiff will competition be? 

2. What rank would I qualify for?  I see a GS-05 requires a college degree and some training like the S-290 course.  Is it possible to attain these after application and before the position start date or must they be completed before application?

3. I'll be applying through the USAJobs website, are there any others I should look at also?

Again, thank you in advance for your responses I truly appreciate it!",,False,self,t5_2ray9,False,,,True,t3_19ln7b,http://www.reddit.com/r/Firefighting/comments/19ln7b/wildland_firefighting_summer_2013_application/,
