And that is great! As long as the help is only helping with spelling or providing a name that is known in the tv show. Just because someone is credited as being a person, that doesn't mean that they have been named in the show yet.

Many of you are accidentally leading the show watchers to ""the right decisions"". It sucks to watch you guys do this, knowing that I can't remove posts without them being confirmed. You also tend to downvote posts that speculate that get too accurate, while leading them to those speculations. This needs to stop.'

We want this subreddit to stay open, we want it to be easily accessible, for you to observe, and for the show watchers to find refuge from the spoilers. But that means you need to step back. No background information from the books ever, no leading to the right information, no ""speculating"" about the future. The current ratios of posters in this subreddit are stupid. 60% of the posters are book readers, 10% are read alongs, which is fine as long as you can separate what is in the book and what is in the show. There are entire threads of book readers speculating and arguing with each other... with not a single show watcher posting. And the book readers are trying to post as ""show watchers"" since they are taking care not to spoil. But honestly, it is just stupid. 

All of us book readers have had the chance to speculate, come to the conclusions we have, make the predictions we have and figure out the ride along the way. Don't take that away from the show watchers. Don't make it so that you lead them to the water. Let them stumble around and find it on their own like we have for the past almost two decades. Don't take their fun from them. 

If you have had children what you are doing right now, is while you kids are playing house is whenever they go off the script you want them to, telling them that they are imagining it wrong. You are sucking the fun out of it. Please stop being party poopers. Take a step back and observe. The only buttons you should be using are the ""send"" button when you are correcting someones name, but only if it was asked for, or the report button to bring something off to our attention. You can't stay in the kiddie play house and not hit your head. You are too tall for that. Stand outside, watch, and let them grow on their own.

I was going to voice how pointless and annoying it is after E07, and talk about how it's a useless distraction from the other fascinating storylines, say that they should just kill him off and be done with it.... But as I was putting these thoughts into words, I had a bit of a revelation.

I thought the Theon storyline was sorely lacking the rest of the story's characteristic commentary on human nature, because it's just about this little psychotic man torturing someone pointlessly. But I realized there is a deeper meaning to it, and it actually has given me another angle for looking at humanity. I'll try to explain.

The significance of Theon's torture isn't about causing pain to a helpless being. It might seem like he's just a chained animal, being hurt for someone's amusement but the choices made by his torturer reveal what makes him (and all of us) so much different from other animals:

Everything he's done to him has revolved around forms of torture that you could never subject a non-human animal to. The things he is exploiting in Theon are the things that define our humanity. This reveals something intrinsic about what it is to be human: our constant need to ask ""Why?"" and to understand our experiences and surroundings gives us a greater capacity for both joy and suffering.

The thing he leverages to psychologically torture Theon is the same thing that has given real-life people our gods (""Why do we exist?""), our science (""Why does this happen this way?""), our philosophy (""Why is this right or wrong?"") and a myriad of other important and uniquely human things. All of these are ways of coping with our endless, obsessive questioning of ""why"" everything.

The torture of Theon shows that no amount of pain inflicted on your physical body can rival the damage of taking away your sense of meaning, your understanding of your experiences and surroundings. And showing this brings about the more useful implication, which is the immeasurable positive value of having meaning, of seeking understanding and achieving a sense of purpose in life.

With this in mind, I'm slightly less dreadful of another drawn-out, cringeworthy scene of torture porn, and a little curious what aspect of human life will be examined next. Whatever happens in life, I can always be thankful I'm not coping with amputated genitals while being tied to a cross in an undisclosed location.",Spoilers Free,False,,t5_2tzv3,False,,,True,t3_1ef8nu,http://www.reddit.com/r/HBOGameofThrones/comments/1ef8nu/my_thoughts_on_the_theon_greyjoy_torture_storyline/,

I've seen these float around in bits and pieces in threads in the past but I figure it would be nice to watch them all in one place. Someone shared them with me and I thought everyone who hasn't read the books but can't get enough of the world of Game of Thrones would enjoy these.

As a non book reader they answered so many questions about things I was unsure about and introduced me to many stories I never knew. So much cool and interesting stuff for people who don't know much about the back-story of GoTs. I hope you guys appreciate them as much as I did.

And the best thing about them.... no spoilers!!!

Per request of some of the users here I made a private subreddit for people to read-a-long to the show with.

We are starting with the Prologue of Game of Thrones this week, and then getting the pacing from the average read speed of that to plan the rest of the reading schedule. 

The goal is to be caught up to the show in time for Season 4.

We will not ever read ahead of where the show is and it will provide a safe place to talk and discuss it, similar to this subreddit, except for one large difference. It is a private subreddit, so there is zero risk of spoilers, and your name won't be out there for people to PM.

This subreddit is open to any show watchers who have not read past where the current season is. Message here or PM me for access.

This is more of a question of your experience on the internet.

Some of us book readers who are a little more deliberate about not posting spoilers in non-spoiler areas were very intensely pissed off about the amount of people in completely non-related threads who would drop ""subtle"" hints about tonight's episode, and were worried that it would make show watchers ""expect"" something terrible to happen, or expect the result that did actually happen.

So my question is - did the formatting of the show (ie, it seems Episode 9 is always ""the big one"") give away that you were in for a shocker tonight? Were you spoiled somewhere else on the internet? 

Anyway, I know this is a forum for ""only show watchers"" but I love lurking here and posting every so often completely non-spoiler related material. Thanks for letting me drink on your tears tonight.

&gt; This sounds like a question for a book reader. It's been asked a lot  
&gt; and I'm just as curious about all the numbers mentioned in the show 
&gt; myself.
&gt; 
&gt; [Game of Thrones map](http://i.imgur.com/L9NMRHB.gif)
&gt;
&gt; ---
&gt;
&gt; **Season 1**
&gt; 
&gt; Lannisters march for Tyrion:
&gt; 
&gt; * *S01E07* 5:30 min in - Tywin says he'll give Jaime half of 
&gt; his forces, 30000 men, to head to Riverrun while Tywin's 30000 head 
&gt; to the Vale to free Tyrion.
&gt; 
&gt; The North's march for Ned Stark:
&gt; 
&gt; * *S01E08* 40min in: Robb says his scouts report reinforcements for 
&gt; Tywin's army from the south (don't know if it's from King's Landing)
&gt; are headed to join up with Tywin's 30000, the reinforcements are
&gt; larger than Tywin's 30000. Robb then tells his mother the
&gt; Northerners have 18000 at that point. Tywin gets reported Robb's
&gt; forces have rushed into The Neck. A couple minutes later, Robb's
&gt; battle map shows he's past Greywater Watch, halfway to The Twins,
&gt; with Jamie's forces a little southwest of Riverrun, and Tywin's forces
&gt; south of the river, north of Harrenhal. The Northerners capture a
&gt; Lannister scout who says he counted 20000 Northerners before he
&gt; got caught (I don't know if he's lying).
&gt;
&gt; * *S01E09* 6:45min in - Theon says Robb has 5 times more men
&gt; than the Freys do at The Twins, making the Frey army 4000 men (a
&gt; ton of foreshowing in this scene btw). Frey gives all of his men
&gt; except 400 to Robb under the conditions. I'm assuming Robb is
&gt; +3600 at this point, but Robb goes -2000 after sending them against
&gt; Tywin's forces. Jamie's forces get wiped out, but nothing about the
&gt; loses on either side after this battle near Riverrun.
&gt;
&gt; **Season 1 Summary**
&gt;
&gt; Starks and their bannermen = approx. less than 19600
&gt;
&gt; Lannisters = +60000
&gt;
&gt; Daenerys = Three baby dragons.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Season 2**
&gt;
&gt; * *S02E01 - S02E04* - Robb says if he allies with Renly Baratheon,
&gt; They'll outnumber the Lannisters 2:1. Salladhor Saan says Stannis
&gt; has the smallest army out of all the kings. Renly + Tyrells stand at
&gt; 100000 men. Robb has another battle, 5 Lannister men fall for every
&gt; Stark man, and it's getting really hazy where their number stands.
&gt; 
&gt; * *S02E05* - Stannis gathers the Baratheon bannermen fighting for
&gt; Renly while the Tyrells take their army to meet up with Tywin's. I
&gt; have no idea where Renly's assassination takes place nor how their
&gt; army was split up.
&gt;
&gt; * *S02E07-08* Robb's forces are located south of the Pyke at The
&gt; Crag to negotiate a surrender, it's right above Castamere. I never
&gt; realized until now he's right above Casterly Rock. Tywin's army heads
&gt; to King's Landing before meeting up with the Tyrells.
&gt;
&gt; * *S02E09 - S02E10* Stannis vs. the Lannisters/Tyrells. I didn't try
&gt; very hard, but I couldn't find the number of men on either side in
&gt; either episode.
&gt; 
&gt; **Season 2 Summary**
&gt;
&gt; Starks and their bannermen - Still approx. less than 20000.
&gt;
&gt; Lannisters + Tyrells = +100000 I'm assuming, at least 80000.
&gt;
&gt; Stannis - After a quick glance, I realize they never say the number
&gt; of men in Stannis' army, someone correct me if I'm wrong.
&gt; 
&gt; Daenerys - 3 Tiny Dragons, some Dothraki and a ship.
&gt;
&gt;
&gt; **Season 3**
&gt; 
&gt; * *S03E01 - S03E04* - Robb's forces are at Harrenhal coming all the
&gt; way from the west. He then heads west again to Riverrun for his
&gt; Grandfather's funeral. No numbers still.
&gt;
&gt; * *S03E05 - S03E08* - Robb beheads Rickard Karstark and loses
&gt; ""almost half his forces"". If the 20000 was correct before, it probably
&gt; means the remaining forces are at 11000 - 12000 men. He heads to
&gt; Casterly Rock again, but not before going to the Twins for Frey's
&gt; men, again.
&gt; 
&gt; * *S03E09 - S03E10* - I've just realized this was all for naught

---

I left out some parts that were already written in the comments like Lady Olenna telling Tyrion in S03E05 18 minutes in she donated
&gt; 12000 infantry men
&gt;
&gt; 1800 mounted lancers
&gt;
&gt; 2000 in support

to the Crown.

Daenerys stands at 8000 Unsullied and 2000 from the Second Sons.

It has been a tremendous failure. In the 2 days that it has been up, I have had to ban more people than all the previous weeks combined, tripled.

For those that do not appreciate the public call outs, here is what is going on:

1) You don't like the post because I am calling you out. That is fine, no one likes getting into trouble. The call out it not aimed at specifically you, but keeps others from breaking the rules as well creating a safer environment.

2) You are a book reader who thinks that our rules are horrible and wrong and why would we ever do that! Please go back to /r/gameofthrones and /r/asoiaf if you can't follow our rules.

So what is going to happen is I am going to quote what I can in every call out that isn't spoilers or book knowledge, and redact anything that can't be seen so people can't know exactly why. If the answer is simply that they are a book reader, I will post that they are a book reader posting in a thread that they are not welcome.

Book readers are welcome to post here in any thread **except the speculation threads, those are for show watchers only**. If you need to speculate on the show there are threads for it over at /r/gameofthrones.

And to the last complaint that I always get when banning, I am not punishing you for posting in other subreddits, I am punishing you for posting in this subreddit. If I wanted to punish you for posting in other subreddits, I would get you banned from those instead.

As for myself, I think we will end up with one of these scenario's for the climax:

* Robb Stark, after gaining an army from Walder Frey, will march towards Casterly Rock. The ensueing battle will be the climax of the season. (And would give Robb's army a satisfying victory after many ""downs"")

Be it the general nature of white walkers
Be it season 2 with Drogo and the witch
Or season 3 with the leader of the Brotherhood Without Banners and how he was revived numerous times.


We already know that the Lord of Light can bring people back, and especially Beric. And considering Beric was very fond of Ned Stark what are the odds that they can bring back Robb as a favor to his old friend(?)?

I feel like there is something odd about them completely erasing the entire Stark storyline (no I am not including Arya or Bran's story) from the show in one fell swoop. It also seems odd that they put a whole lot of effort into showing the power of resurrecting Beric only to have Melisandre pretty much say ""Thats cool bro, but I just want the boy"" and leave. And considering the show has previously established ""Only death can bring life"" I am saying Beric gives his life to bring back Robb.

tl;dr: Season 3 emphasizes the power of resurrection without doing anything with it. Season 3 then kills off some huge characters again. Therefor season 3 has to end with one of them coming back

Today the moderators want to open the floor to the community to discuss the rules. We have done this previously, but at a time when the community was much smaller. We recognise that a rules update is required and think it's vitally important that you are able to have your say. The moderators have all read the books, so this is your place more than it is ours. Each of us do have our own opinions though, and we reserve the right to share them as part of this discussion. Other book readers in the community are welcome to share their thoughts as well.

**We will take upvotes into account for serious rules suggestions, but downvotes will be ignored. Don't downvote an opinion or suggestion that you disagree with, debate it.**

The current rules are as follows:

------------------------------------------------------------


1. **Follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)**

2. **No spoilers in post titles.** If you wish to ask a question about an aspect of the show, use a title such as *""[S2E05] A question about Theon""*. Events up to and including the specific episode in question do not have to be tagged as spoilers within such a post.

3. **Speculation threads are for show watchers only. Book readers are not permitted to post in any speculation threads.** The only exception is corrections of the names of places and people in the show. ***VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE BAN.***

4. **Content exclusively from the ASOIAF novels is strictly forbidden.** This includes comparing differences between the novels and the HBO show. Some fans of the show will go on to read the books later.

5. **Posting to articles that contain spoilers is acceptable** so long as those articles are specifically about the show and the link title is properly tagged. Users can click at their own risk.

6. **Do not post image macros, memes, pictures of GoT actors outside of GoT, or other 'silly' content.** These items are welcome in the official weekly silly thread.

7. **If you believe a post contains spoilers use the report button and do not downvote.** This rule is mostly for the book readers in the community. Sometimes non-readers speculate accurately and a raft of downvotes will essentially confirm that they are correct, thus creating a spoiler where there was not one before.

8. **Links to and discussion of illegal means to watch the show are not allowed.**

1. **Follow [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)**

2. **No spoilers in post titles.** If you wish to ask a question about an aspect of the show, use a title such as *""[S2E05] A question about Theon""*. Events up to and including the specific episode in question do not have to be tagged as spoilers within such a post.

3. **Speculation threads are for show watchers only. Book readers are not permitted to post in any speculation threads.** The only exception is corrections of the names of places and people in the show. ***VIOLATION OF THIS RULE WILL RESULT IN AN IMMEDIATE BAN.***

4. **Content exclusively from the ASOIAF novels is strictly forbidden.** This includes comparing differences between the novels and the HBO show. Some fans of the show will go on to read the books later.

5. **Posting to articles that contain spoilers is acceptable** so long as those articles are specifically about the show and the link title is properly tagged. Users can click at their own risk.

6. **Do not post image macros, memes, pictures of GoT actors outside of GoT, or other 'silly' content.** These items are welcome in the official weekly silly thread.

7. **If you believe a post contains spoilers use the report button and do not downvote.** This rule is mostly for the book readers in the community. Sometimes non-readers speculate accurately and a raft of downvotes will essentially confirm that they are correct, thus creating a spoiler where there was not one before.

That is evolving simultaneously with the very deep-rooted resentment for his own father, contempt for his sister, and in general we feel he's becoming more ashamed of being a Lannister (or at least he's ashamed of what the Lannisters have become).

So, when he inevitably hears about the totally barbaric and non-righteous manner of which the mother and brother of his new bride have been murdered at the command &amp; collaboration of his father (during a wedding of all things), I can't help but think/hope that his displeasure he feels towards his family will come to a head and that things will get ugly.

From what we've heard, Jon Snow was an infant Ned Stark brought home to Winterfell after Robert's rebellion. Jon was a baby Ned supposedly had gotten with woman outside his marriage, but we are never told who she was (are we?). 

Does this cheating fit with Ned Stark's sense of honor and dignity? He just doesn't seem like the guy who would cheat on his wife, even though he was not the one she was supposed to marry. I don't know. He did make mistakes in Season 1, so perhaps he made a few mistakes earlier too. Still... what if Jon Snow was not his son, but someone else's? It would have to be someone important that he wanted to protect and hide the identity of. A King's bastard, perhaps? Or someone from a family which was no longer allowed to live? Jon's not blonde, so I'm guessing it would be impossible for him to be Targaryen or Lannister.

What do you guys think? Is this foreshadowing that revenge will exacted upon the Freys, and possibly the Lanisters, for the treachery they did to Starks?

I mean, the show oddly does have the audience pay great sympathy for this family of the North, hence the dread we all felt as soon as the song *The Rain of Castamere* started playing when the doors were closed with a boom at the Red Wedding. Do you think that it was just a ploy by the directors to make us identify with the Starks, just so they can create S03E09?? 

If so, why was the significance of Bran telling that story? Do you think the Starks still have a chance, since Bran is still alive, and he clearly will play a significant role in the War Against the White Walkers. If we win this war against the White Walkers, will Bran then gain support from Westeros?

**TL;DR:** Bran told a dark, foreshadow-y story relevant to the Red Weddings. What do you think will happen now among the Starks, Freys, &amp; Lanisters (maybe even the Targaryeans -- will they save Westeros from the White Walkers and win the Iron Throne)?

That means that none of us know that the Romulans will be coming in during Dance with Dragons to help Worf perform the archaic Klingon Rite of passage with Alexander, etc. Please help us keep it as much that was as possible.

Please report comments, articles, etc as soon as you see them that don't follow the guidelines. That is anything that is in the books and not the shower. It will make it a lot easier for us to get to it fast, even though the community is pretty small now, it is a good habit to be in.

I go through every thread and anyone who posts anything that could be from the books, I check their history to see if they post in any of the other subreddits. If you guys can report, it would make it a lot faster for the two of us that are mods that have read the books.

I think that Brienne is stronger and has a better reach. Jamie I think is probably more agile and a lot more experieced in battle. I also think that Jamie's arrogance is a disadvantage since it might lead him to be oerconfident.

Full strength Brienne vs. full strength Jamie. Place your bets.

*Hey /r/HBOGameofThrones! I'm a book-reader so  when I visit this subreddit I just read people's posts without commenting, because I like trying to see the show through a show-watchers eyes (much as I love the books, you guys are having a much better and purer experience watching the show, and I envy that). I've posted this discussion of the Music of Game of Thrones in the big GOT subreddits with some minor spoilers but after a post here talking about lack of content, I removed every spoiler from this document so I could post it here. There's no book or show spoilers here! The only ""spoilers"" would be the names of the songs on the soundtrack, if you count that - like saying ""the song Huge Chicken on the Season 2 Soundtrack"" would spoil there's a huge chicken in season 2.

I worked hard to eliminate every book-spoiler and to clearly mark even the slightest spoiler of any show episode, but if I made any mistake, let me know right away and I will fix it quickly. I've triple-checked and it seems clean to me though.*

---

I love Ramin Djawadi’s score for Game of Thrones and think he’s done a great job with it. I think it’s fun to identify the themes and motifs spread across the show and the soundtracks. I’m in the process of trying to identify all the different themes and motifs in Game of Thrones, and thought I’d share what I’ve got so far so others can check it out and hopefully help as well.

I’ve done a youtube link to every occurrence(that I’ve identified so far) of a theme or motif in the soundtracks, but there are lots more occurrences of these musical ideas in the show itself. If the links go down, let me know and I’ll try to find one up, but I’ll list the time the theme or motif occurs at anyway so you can check it out if you own the soundtrack yourself. If the link’s down, you can always just youtube the name of the track that I provide yourself, then follow the timings I provide (like 0:15 seconds, or 1:43 seconds) to find the spots in the track that I am talking about.

---

**Some Notes Before I Start:**

GOT S1 OST = the Game of Thrones Season 1 Soundtrack, GOT S2 OST = the Game of Thrones Season 2 Soundtrack

I’ve titled the themes the names that I like the best and make the most sense to me, but of course you could title them different things – what I call the “Iron Throne theme” you might call “King’s Landing theme”, or what I call “Theon’s theme” you might call “Greyjoy theme”. The general idea is there, regardless, and that’s what matters.

Lots of the tracks use more than one theme. In my iTunes, I’ve titled them like this

http://imgur.com/fy7vjuU

I’m posting this to a few different places; the General Game of Thrones (the TV Show) board on westeros.org ( http://asoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/forum/39-general-got/ ) , and the www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf and www.reddit.com/r/gameofthrones subreddits on Reddit.

**Nine primary themes or motifs:**

---

**Main Theme :**


I call this the Main Theme because it’s the theme of the main title, displayed most prominently in the opening credits. It’s nice and majestic.

---

“Main Title”, track 1 of the GOT S1 and GOT S2 OST.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=q4faDId9J7U#t=8s

0:08 seconds

---

“The Kingsroad”, track 4 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=muBoV4fmfnw#t=8s

0:08 seconds, 1:12 seconds, 1:29 seconds

---

“Jon’s Honor”, track 17 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=0w4pxZ0EeXM#t=83s

1:23 seconds (I’m referring more to the swelling notes than the distinctive rhythmic march the main title uses)

---

“Game of Thrones”, track 21 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=TYNnv8qPR88#t=10

0:10 seconds

---

“Victory Does Not Make Us Conquerors”, track 24 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=1HGFlelKc4o#t=55s

0:55 seconds

---

“Three Blasts”, track 21 of the GOT S2 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=VZUkIMXv7-g#t=96s

1:35 seconds, 1:54 seconds. This almost could have been in a section of its own, but I think it’s really just a very dark and twisted variation on the main theme, and belongs here.

---

**Stark theme**

I call this the Stark theme because it always centres around Winterfell or any of the Starks. It’s pretty sparse, it suits the North. It’s usually played on a violin in a pretty “scratchy” fashion (I’m certainly not a violinist, so excuse the crude terminology!), it’s quite an emotional piece.

---

“Goodbye Brother”, track 3 of GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=Zpln5JiK5nc#t=46s

0:46 seconds

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=oth_nFcbK-Y#t=43s

0:43 seconds. Note: it’s titled King of the North on the official soundtrack, but I’m pretty sure that’s an error – shouldn’t it be King IN the North?

---

“Winterfell”, track 6 of the GOT S2 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=0U0X_wP0vMc#t=38s

0:38 seconds, 1:14 seconds

---

**Iron Throne theme**


This theme seems connected to the idea of being King, so I thought Iron Throne was a good name for it. We first hear it nice and jolly in “The King’s Arrival” but it gets pretty dark in some of its variations, see “The Throne Is Mine”.

---


“The King’s Arrival”, track 5 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=MbBAtQ7bLis#t=1s

0:01 seconds, 1:05 seconds, 2:42 seconds.

---

**Daenerys theme**


Possibly my favourite of the lot, it’s a very majestic and ethereal theme. [Season 1 Finale] (/s ""It crops up subtly a few times in Season 1 before being played strongly and fully in all its glory in the closing minutes of the Season 1 finale."")

---

“Finale”, track 29 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=T2mBS8iW3VA#t=38s

0:38 seconds. You owe it to yourself to hear the whole track start to end. Probably the best track out of all the ones I’ve listed.

---

“Love in the Eyes”, track 6 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=61-WS5nm_kc#t=69s

1:10 seconds. My favourite track!

---

**Lannister theme**


A pretty quiet, but very spooky theme, I suppose it’s meant to evoke the politicking of the Lannisters. At times, it sounds rather creepy!


---

“A Raven From King’s Landing, track 7 of the GOT S1 OST

1:12 seconds. [Episode 2 of Season 1] (/s ""Very sneaky, this track plays while Cersei sympathises with Catelyn and it’s all emotional and sad, but near the end of the track the creepy Lannister theme comes into play"")

---

“Await the King’s Justice”, track 13 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=yxsiLOJba-Y#t=58s

0:42 seconds, 0:58 seconds

---

“Black of Hair”, track 18 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=67yiBxS23DQ#t=51s

0:51 seconds, 1:12 seconds. Played almost in “reverse” if that makes sense. [Episode 6, A Golden Crown, of Season 1] (/s ""It fits in with the scene it’s played in, which you can probably guess from the title, which does refer to a sort of reverse/secret Lannister type of scenario."")

---

“Small Pack of Wolves”, track 20 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=w0lwUOfzDO8#t=81s

1:21 seconds. Subtle, but I’m pretty sure those drawn-out notes follow the progression of the Lannister theme.

---

“The Throne Is Mine”, track 2 of the GOT S2 OST.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=6OzWvUktaU8#t=150s

2:30 seconds. Awesome transition from the Iron Throne theme into the Lannister theme.

---

**Night’s Watch theme**

A very simple theme, but also a majestic and strong one. Suits the Night’s Watch, I think.

---

“The Night’s Watch”, track 27 of the GOT S1 OST

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=-9xqq7xAWBs#t=43s

If you have any input we can add it here:

___________________

Some moderator suggestions:

- Don't click on any threads, post, articles, etc that haven't been flaired by the mods. We do sleep at some point, but while we are awake we flair the content that is posted in the subreddit. This keeps it so that we know which things we have approved and which ones we have overlooked as well as giving labels for all of you to know. 

The Four Labels are: 

- **Business**: These threads are completely spoiler free. Anything about the series must be tagged as such. Someone who hasn't watched the first episode should be able to look at these threads without having anything spoiled for them even that [S1E1](/s ""Jon Arryn is dead"")

-**Spoiler Free**: This means that if you are up to date on the current episode, that you can't be spoiled in it, whether it is an article on the economics of Westeros, a discussion of who your favorite character is or a where who is thread. Any additions to these threads after the episode it is flagged for or dated for must have spoiler tags put on it. Spoiler free also means that any speculation must be tagged.

- **Spoiler Thread**: This is a thread that has spoilers from the next episode in it, as well as the weekly discussion thread. The information for the next episode can only come from HBO official sources, no leaked information. That includes the next time on trailers, as well as the TV guide short synopsis. Occasionally there might be a GRRM/Actors panel that might be posted. Check the comments for where to avoid the spoilers in the video, a comment like that will be required in every one of those threads.

- **Speculation Thread**, No Book Readers - These threads are exclusively for show watchers. It is a zero tolerance policy. If you are a book reader, or have posted in any spoilers all thread on /r/gameofthrones or /r/asoiaf or in /r/asoiafcirclejerk at all, you will be instantly banned for posting in these threads.  Even if it is simply to correct spelling or make a silly joke. This is for the show watchers only, a place to speculate without worrying about being led or spoiled. No speculation tags are needed in these threads until the next episode occurs. Then any new information must be tagged.
__________________

- Make an account specifically to post in this subreddit. Please PM us from the main account in order for us to know who you are. It will not be shared with anyone. Do not look at your reddit mail for that account ever.

- Do not EVER look at the comments on articles or videos posted anywhere that has Game of Thrones content.

- Know that we as the mod team will never ever tell you if something is a spoiler or not. That in itself spoils you.

- Know that if we are asking for sources on a post it is because it is one of many topics that we randomly selected for that point simply because we knew it would come up. Some points are extremely valid, and sources will still be asked for. Others are very silly, and some are completely out in left field. Regardless if you are ""right"" or ""wrong"" on these topics, we will still ask you for sources so those topics that are book reader only knowledge when asked for sources will not pop out to any of you.

- If you have any questions about something that you googled by accident or pop up feel free to PM me or send in a mod mail instead of asking in one of the other subreddits, especially if you think it might be true and don't want to spoil others about it. It would be very hard to spoil me or the other mods. I would rather take 2 minutes out of my day to work something through with you than you be spoiled.

- Do not look at anyone who posts in this subreddits post history. Many of the helpful book readers in the explanation threads on this subreddit came directly from spoilers all threads in /r/asoiaf and /r/gameofthrones.

A few show watcher suggestions:

- Avoid the other GRRM network subreddits. While a valuable source of information, they are a valuable source of information. Even the silliest thread can quickly devolve into untagged spoilers.




A book readers suggestion:

- Read all the books. This is a last resort because we will be sad to see you go.

If you have any suggestions or criticisms please comment and we'll take whatever you have to say into consideration. I would like to have a finalised set of rules posted and linked in the sidebar before the next episode airs.


-----------------------------------------------------

1. No spoilers in post titles. If you wish to ask a question about an aspect of the show, use a title such as ""[S2E05] A question about Theon"". If a thread is likely to contain spoilers for multiple episodes this should be indicated with a [spoilers, all episodes] tag or similar.

2. Content from the George RR Martins novels is forbidden. This includes comparing differences in the events/characters in the novels to those in the HBO show. Some fans of the show will go on to read the books later. The only exception to this rule is if background information is requested, in which case threads such as ""Readers, please tell me about the Red Woman's religion"" are allowed but these types of questions do not belong in the comment sections of any other threads.

3. Posting to articles that contain potential spoilers or book comparisons is allowed so long as those articles are primarily about the show and the link title is properly tagged. Users can click at their own risk.

4. No memes, gifs, image macros, or ""I was watching [other show/movie] and look who I saw"" posts.

-----------------------------------------------------

As I've said, any opinions would be welcomed.

Additionally, we would like to have a custom subreddit design but none of the mods are familiar with Photoshop/CSS/HTML.

To use the black you use [episode number] (/s ""This is the text that will be hidden"")

The red will be for speculation. This is things that haven't happened yet but are implied by the show that you think will happen in the near future. So what you do for the red is [character/region speculation] (/b "" This is what you are predicting will happen. Cersei drinks more, Tyrion says something awesome, Arya yells that she isn't a boy, Hodor says Hodor, Catelyn does something irrational, Ygritte does not inform Jon Snow he known nothing, the wolves look cool, etc"")

If it has been discussed elsewhere I apologize.

**Roslin is *not* Walder Frey's daughter.**

* As we saw in the lineup, Lord Frey has no other daughter who looks half as decent (apologies to the Ladies Frey)
* Walder owes Robb and his house nothing. Why then would he give away his most beautiful daughter? He may be conniving, but he's certainly not stupid and it is obvious from the beginning that he couldn't care less about the wellbeing of his family. In his eyes, Roslin would have been his greatest asset next to The Twins.
* No one had ever mentioned Roslin before Frey's proposal. You'd think *someone* would have noticed her in her twenty-odd years and she would be the talk of the seven kingdoms. Again, it's possible that Frey would have kept her hidden away as a future bargaining chip.

&gt;*""If the lamb sees the knife, she panics. Her panic seeps into the meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.""*  
&gt; - Melisandre

- Frey needed to keep the groom and the Northmen happy. Up to this point he had been more than kind, and more kind than usual, providing food and accommodations for the whole of Robb's army. Had the veil revealed one of Frey's average daughters the reception would have been a dreary affair with less wine a'flowing, and Robb and Co. wouldn't have been off their guard. 

So who is Roslin (if that is her real name)?

* Frey took/bought her.
* A volunteer from one of Frey's vassals who did not want their house caught up in the war.
* A gift of Tywin Lannister; (a) because Walder responds well to pretty girls, or (b) for exactly the purpose of being used in the ambush.

When to use tags:

-When discussing something outside the scope of the thread. For example the Episode discussion threads, if you go back to them with information from the next episode, use spoiler tags. The same with the speculation threads.

-When speculating outside of the speculation threads use speculation tags, no matter how big, small, or obvious the speculation. For example, Theon is being held by a [no spoilers speculation](/b ""rampaging rhinocerous"") or Varys is working for [no spoilers speculation](/b ""Bruce Wayne""). Basically if something has not been explicitly stated, it is speculation. If a character states it, it is fine. If it is shown on screen it is fine.

The most rampant nonusage of speculation tags are in the episode discussion threads. Please use them in the future in these threads.
___________
When not to use tags:

-No tags are required in speculation threads.

-No tags are required when talking of events that are happening on screen in discussion threads.

-No tags are required as long as you are posting in the scope of the thread you are posting in.


EDIT: As a reminder, if you tag a thread as speculation, there are no book readers allowed to post in the thread. If they do, it is a ban, same as the weekly speculation threads.

Is there any chance of getting flair for this subreddit, for those who have only watched maybe the Houses and such that they have in the other subs, and for the readers/people who have been spoiled, a mark of where they are in the series? I'm sure the mods in the other subreddits would be more than happy to help you guys get it set up. Or I could try to write it myself (I'm rusty at CSS though) after I finish my finals this week so that it is a safer environment, and that way people know who is safe and who isn't.

I'm thinking for marking obvious book readers or people who have been spoiled as a warning to not go through their chat history, in case they have posted untagged marks in asoiaf and gameofthrones.

Would make me feel better as acting as a shield here if I knew that people were warned not to look through my chat history. I have been tagging everything spoilers since I found out about this subreddit, but I fear for those who might be looking for something else I said in this subreddit accidentally seeing what is posted in the others from looking at my chat history instead.

R'hllor (the Lord of Light) seems to be the only god who's actually operated in any major capacity. He's supposedly brought someone back from the dead multiple times, helped create a shadow monster, &amp; possibly helped kill Robb.  
Do you think any of that was actually R'hllor's doing, or are Thoros &amp; Melisandre just magical in some capacity? Would Robb have died without the leech burning?  
Blood Magic seems to exist as a practice without any godly intervention (eg. Mirri Maz Duur's ritual to 'save' Drogo), so could that be what Melisandre uses too.

Catelyn believes that her prayer to the Seven Gods gave Jon Snow the pox &amp; subsequently saved him from it when he was younger. So far that seems to be the only thing mentioned that they might have had a hand in, &amp; even then it could easily be coincidence.

Other gods mentioned in the show include the Old Gods in the North, the Great Stallion that the Dothraki believe in, Mirri Maz Duur's village's Great Shepard, the Drowned God of the Iron Isles, the God of Death that Syrio Forel speaks of, &amp; the many-breasted god that Varys &amp; Tyrion discuss in passing.
