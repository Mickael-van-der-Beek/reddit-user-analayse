1356028503.0,641,self.Paranormal,156gom,List of Creepy Wikipedia Articles,patashn1k,752,111,73,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/156gom/list_of_creepy_wikipedia_articles/,"**Edit: if anyone's still interested, an updated list is [available here](http://pastebin.com/TKisaP1E) in a better format and on a static page. The one below is unchanged.**

There's a list like this that's been floating around the 'net for some time, but I recall it having duplicates and broken links. I've been keeping a word doc of my own list for a couple of years (you know, like people do) that's ended up being (rather obsessively, I know) categorised for readability. I thought I should post it somewhere, and reddit is semi-permanent, so here goes. Note that some articles are more interesting or bizarre than creepy. Please contribute, and enjoy your sleepless night(s).

P.S. Apologies if there's a subreddit better suited for this; I'm not a regular so wasn't sure. Is not being addicted to reddit considered paranormal?

This one, however, is by far the strangest and most mind-boggling one that I have had. 

Back story.

I worked at Walt Disney World for four years. Most days, I looked a little something like [this](http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3210/2911576874_878afb80ea.jpg). It was a fantastic job, I was happy every day. I left because I had to continue school. 

This experience happened at work, and it was actually one of my last shifts before I would be leaving the company for good. I was working at the restaurant Garden Grille in the Land pavilion at Epcot. The fun thing about this restaurant was the [layout](http://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/03/3c/4f/5c/garden-grill.jpg) of it. There were two stories of the restaurant, and to complete our ""rotation"", you would complete one layer, go up or down the stairs, complete the other layer, and go up or down the stairs again. The main goal of our ""set"" was to see every guest in the restaurant at least once. Also, there is only one way in/out for guests, down that ramp there. 

The greatest part about working at this restaurant was the final set of the night. Usually, by 9 pm the restaurant would be mostly cleared out, with three or four families remaining. And we would either be done with the set in 10 minutes and get out early, or we would get time to play around in the restaurant and have fun. 

Experience begins!

It is the last set of the night, three families left in the restaurant. Two lower, one upper. Four characters, two began up, two began down. I started up and greeted the family on the top section. I completed the circle, and was about to go down my set of stairs, when I saw the back of a man's head sitting just to the right of the stairs I was about to descend. Well, I had to greet everyone in the restaurant one last time, so I came up to his table, and signaled 'hello'. 

He serenely (yes, serenely, his movements were so elegant) turned to me, and grinned widely. He didn't have a drink, a place-setting, and was not wearing a name-tag (like a manager would). Instead, he grasped the menu of the restaurant in his hands, and laid it carefully onto the table when I waved.

""Why, hello there, Dale."" He said to me. His voice was slightly raspy. He had dark, slick hair, and was wearing a long sleeve button down shirt, with a vest over it, and a tie. He also had a mustache, with an otherwise clean shaven face. I thought it was cool that an adult male knew which chipmunk he was talking to, usually no one knows Chip from Dale. 

Again, I waved, and extended my hand to his to shake. He gave me a firm handshake, and put his hands back on the menu, picking it up.

I pointed to the menu, rubbed my stomach, and held my arms in a ""?"" position, asking ""Are you hungry?""/""Are you eating?"" It was odd, because it looked like he had just been seated for dinner...but the restaurant would be closing in about 15 minutes, and stopped seating new guests about 30 minutes ago.

The man laughed, shook his head, and said, ""Oh no, nothing for me today, Dale."" 

I nodded, and glanced over the railing to see if any of the families or other characters were in my view. None were. 

He spoke to me again.

""I'm just here to check up on things. See how they are going."" 

I looked back at him, a little confused. I didn't react much, because I started feeling weird. The man put the menu down again, and touched my arm. Through the fur, I felt 'static', and a swift feeling of pride. 

""Go say 'hi' to the children down there. The restaurant is closing."" 

Again, I nodded, and gave him a salute. But before I moved to go down the stairs again, I signaled to him. I pointed at my chest, and put my finger to the table. ""I'll be back."" He nodded, ""Alright, Dale"" and picked up the menu.

I went down the stairs and rounded to the other side of the restaurant, and gave hugs and kisses to the last two families. All the other characters were already back inside, done for the night. My captain (the character manager of the night) said, ""Found you, Dale!"", took me by the arm, and went to guide me back inside. I gave her the ""one second"" sign, and ran back to the other side of the restaurant, to find the man again. 

There was no one there. The menu was still in the middle of the table, instead of tucked behind the napkin holder, but the chair had been pushed in. 

No one had walked out behind me while I was on the other side with the families, and the only other way out was through a door that leads to the kitchen and into a backstage area. But, the man was not wearing a Disney costume, nor did he have a name tag on.

I went through the backstage door, and rejoined my fellow cast members upstairs. The instant I was up there, I brought up the man. I was greeted with ""What man?"", ""The dad with the kids?"", and head shaking. 

When I went home that night, I reflected. I truly believe this was a paranormal experience, and at first I thought I had met Walt Disney himself. However, I would have recognized him, surely, and Walt never actually saw Epcot. Which leads me now to believe I met an imagineer, or some other sort of operator. 

It boggles me, because I knew something didn't feel normal when I was interacting with him. He interpreted my pantomime too well, and the fact that he knew the difference between Chip and Dale was amazing.  

Every now and then I start trying to look into Disney's past and find photos of someone I might recognize. No luck yet, but his image is certainly burned into my memory. 

I always make a point now when I'm on a Disney vacation to visit the Land, and hang out there for a while, waiting to catch a glimpse of this man. For one reason or another, I feel like I will see him again.

1369678223.0,226,self.Paranormal,1f5d5n,Conclusive proof of Reincarnation ??!! Please help...this is FREAKING ME OUT .,gregclark1,279,53,151,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1f5d5n/conclusive_proof_of_reincarnation_please_helpthis/,"In June 2003 while working as Development Producer for a TV company I came up with the idea of doing a documentary on reincarnation. I found a psychic who claimed she could discover past-lives. In order to prove the process I gave her pictures of myself. She would do the rest.
A few days later she gave me written details of three past lives. One detailed a life just before WW2 where I was working underwater in a ""machine"" I was happy but then something happened and I was trapped. We weren't attacked. (She was insistent this had happened just before the war) but it was an accident. I was trapped for many hours. The rescue party were above us but they couldn't get to us. We all died. She wrote that she saw the word Thesis floating on the water.
This was strange, I had a dream a year or so previously where I was trapped in a submarine. It was an unusually vivid dream. We were making attempts to get to the surface with me trying to open an escape hatch through a flooded tunnel, but no matter how hard I tried the hatch wouldn't open. It was hopeless, half drowning I gave up and went back. An officer and a group of crew were waiting on me. I had tried my best, I was commended for it, but I could see the intense worry and panic growing in their eyes. I was sent back to my bunk to rest. I was finding it hard to breathe, the air was so thick, hot and wet...The dream ended here.
Maybe this was the reason I looked up submarine sinkings around 1939 I don't know, but nothing came up. However, I have Journalistic research skills so I accessed newspaper databases only open to journalists who subscribe . I found a HMS Thetis, not Thesis, that sunk in Liverpool bay on its maiden sea trials on the 1st of June 1939.
During routine drills one of the torpedo hatches was opened accidentally causing her to flood and sink. Rescue teams were soon upon it but they didn't receive authorisation from the Admirality to carry out the rescue. This was immediately pre-war and the submarine was classified. The delay was fatal. Exactly 100 people died. Many attempts were made by the men to abandon ship but the Davis escape hatch broke and only two men managed to get out. It was a scandal.
Now there is a lot of information on the Thetis accident now on the Internet but in 2003 when the Internet was still in its infancy there was none. She could have happened upon this story and fed it to me but I was fairly confident the psychic didn't have the research skills needed. (Plus when I had suggested a submarine. She said she'd thought - being ignorant of military history - that she didn't think submarines were around then, which of course they were having been popularised in WW1)
I told the psychic I didn't know what do with this information. It was intriguing but not conclusive. She said I'd have to work through karma associated with the sinking and that it would need equalised in this life. The opposed of the tragedy would need to happen.The idea was a bit far fetched. And more importantly the process wasn't visual enough for TV so the idea joined the 99% of rejected TV ideas.
Now this is where its gets increasingly bizarre. Two years later I'm working for the BBC, again developing new ideas for shows. You get used to the rejection, and only about 1 in 100 ideas will ever end up on television. So when I came upon a story that a Russian submarine has been rescued by a British crew in Kamchatka Russia. I thought it was worth pitching, but I didn't hold out much hope. To my surprise the programme was commissioned immediately by the BBC and I was soon helping make the documentary called SUB RESCUE.
details below
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/4128614.stm http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/04/sub.shtml
It was a great story. Russia had put up an international rescue call for the trapped submarine The PRIZ. The Russian rescue attempt had proven futile. The men had less than 48 hrs worth of oxygen left. The U.S , British , Japanese and the French had all responded to the call. But the British and Americans were quickest off the mark so the Russian said yes to those two. In less than 24 hours a team of ten men from all over the UK had assembled with 8 tonnes of equipment and were flying over the Northpole in a C-17 to Petropavlosk, Kamchatka to rescue the men with only hours oxygen to spare. The British led the mission with some American assistance having arrived in Russia first.
As I researched how the men had survived and the oxygen preservation techniques needed when trapped on a submarine. I thought it a strange coincidence that here I was researching a case what was the polar opposite of what my supposed past life had been. In mine bureacracy had killed the 100 men of the Thetis. With the Priz red tape had been cast aside and quick decision making had a near impossible mission possible.
For the documentary we decided to arrange a meeting with the men. The Russians had never met the British crew so we took Stuart Gold and Commander Riches back to Petropavlovsk to meet with Cpt Miloshevsky and the rest of the crew.
It was an emotional night that will stay with me for the rest of my life. The Russians thanked the men for saving their lives and for the ability to see their children grow up.
But one thing bothered them....The young Russian Captain Miloshevsky asked Stuart Gold via an Interpreter why it was the British and not the Americans, Japanese or Russians had rescued them when the other countries were closer and had greater resources.
Stuart Gold bent down and opened up his bag. In it contained the publicitly booklet for the British Submarine Rescue system. He open the booklet to the first page , and told Miloshevsky. ""The reason the we are all here tonight............... is that in 1939 the HMS Thetis sunk off the coast of Liverpool on its maiden sea trial and 100 men lost their lives.......The British Navy resolved that it must never happen again and so they set up the best submarine rescue system possible. This is why we are here... and not the Americans , Russians or anyone else. This is why we manged to save you.
I was astounded. Here was someone pointing at the same picture of the Thetis that I had looked at 5 years previously. Here was someone independent of me telling a third party, that the reason we were all standing here was because of the Thetis accident. Just as the psychic had predicted. Now like most people I'm pretty agnostic. God, don't know? Religion NO! . Creative force, possibly? But whatever belief system I have I truly cannot explain these events rationally.
Some people have glibly mentioned coincidence, but the odds are so astronomical that it would have to be trillions to one. Of course these coincidences do happen but this wasn't just a coincidence of the mere mention of something. Like if someone mentioned a village in deepest Africa and then it suddenly being mentioned to you two years later. This was more complex. It was a straight preditction that my life would need to become directly involved in an submarine accident that had happened 70 years previously. Not only that but the event would need to be the exact opposite of the tragedy of the Thetis.
To explain this rationality I would need to include odds that are so astronomical they become irrational. They would need to become a faith system held by an irrational faith in the rational. And that is something I cannot do.......
So can anyone else help me explain this???
I swear that everything above its 100 percent True to the facts.

My mother was pregnant with me and I was going to be my parent's first child. They lived in a house that was a decent size in Sandy Hook, Connecticut (Yes, the same Sandy Hook), but my dad was a carpenter so he decided to put an addition onto the house before I was born to make more room in case they wanted more children down the road. Being a carpenter, my dad had a lot of tools and basically did the whole addition by himself.

One day while working on the addition, he noticed that he was missing a tool that he knew was there the day before. He looked all over the house for it but it was no where to be found so he ended up just buying a new one at the hardware store. The next day the same exact thing happened; a tool went missing and he bought a new one. This went on for a long time; a screwdriver here, a hammer there, one by one they would all start disappearing day after day with no real explanation. When I was born, my dad had basically replaced every tool he owned with a new one by the time the addition was finally done.

Part 1 of the weird stuff that happened: After my mom gave birth to me and was good to leave the hospital my parents came home to put me in my brand new room that my dad had just built. Shockingly, every tool that my dad had ""misplaced"" was lying in the threshold to my room arranged in order from smallest to largest. No signs of damage to any of them, they were exactly like they were the day that they went missing. No tools were unaccounted for. Now you might think that maybe someone was stealing them and when they saw that my dad was building a room for a newborn baby they had a guilt trip and returned them, but it gets weirder.
This whole incident freaked my parents out and they would tell the story to friends, relatives etc. After telling it to my aunt, she suggested that my parents talk to her friend who claims that she can talk to spirits. Being skeptical about the whole spiritual thing, my parents reluctantly agreed to have the ""spirit lady"" as my mom calls her, come by.

As soon as she entered the house, she knew that something or someone was there she told my parents. In her own way she communicated with the spirit and identified ""him"" as Cato, a runaway slave from the south who made his way up to Connecticut to start a new life. She said that he built this house himself and still resides in it but is friendly. Apparently ""cato"" was upset that my dad was adding to the house that he built and was trying to stop him by stealing his tools but when he figured out that my dad was building it to make room for a child, he understood and returned the tools. Cato kind of became a fun excuse for us in the family any time the remote went missing or something fell off the counter. ""Cato didn't want you to change the channel"" my mom would say. It was kind of freaky but nothing paranormal ever happened after the tool incident. It was kind of cool to think that we had a friendly ghost in the house watching over us.

We moved out of that house in 1997 to the Boston area not knowing whether or not the story about Cato was true. However, ten years after moving out in 2007, one of my family members still living in the Sandy Hook area called to inform us that there was an archaeological study done in my old city about former slave houses and sure enough, my house was chosen to be part of it. She sent us the reports and it all made us take a step back. They found an ""X"" on part of the chimney base which traces back to homes built by former slaves as well as a shoe under kitchen floorboards which was believed to prevent evil from entering the house. Even more striking was that the historians believed the house to be built by a man by the name Cato Freedom, a runaway slave. I havent been back by that house since I left but I would love to have the chance to go check it out.

We have heard lots of banging ever since we started the job and seeing as the next door neighbours were having work done at the same time we thought it was them. 

Anyway one day the vans that were outside the neighbours house weren't there and we could still hear banging. (didnt even realise this until we spoke about it after). On our dinner break we decided it would be a great idea to make a video of us (well my friend) venturing into the cellar, or basement for the Americans. My friend is the one filming it.

http://youtu.be/A3xdwnOUqRg

Now he is ALWAYS playing practical jokes on people, but when he came running up the stairs he was white as a ghost. All he did when he stopped filming was replay this video and showed me too. 

We were told at a later date aswell that the builder we were working for got the house at a cheaper rate as the guy who lived there last, had lived there all his life and died there, that the house was used as some sort of outhouse or residents for the prison nurses (something along those lines anyway). Also the builder had also mentioned that he was certain he turned the lights off at night when he left, and on 3 or 4 occasions came into the lights being on in the morning.  

• We were the ONLY ones working in the house.
• footage was filmed on phone on portrait so sorry for the bad sizing (  if anyone knows how to make it better let me know :)   )
• Damn this freaked me out.

I have been living in a rural, wooded area in Southern Michigan for the last fifteen years of my life.  I've spent quite a bit of those fifteen years in the woods, located behind my house.  When I was little, I used to ride my ATV on the trails.  As I grew older, I'd take girls for ""walks"" in the woods.  As I grew older, still, the house was passed down to me, and became my own.  What I'm getting at here, is that I know the five-square mile hunk of woods behind my house like the back of my own hand.  
  
Just for fun, I used to take my friends for long walks out into the middle of the woods (Usually with some booze, or something to smoke on).  I would always insist on getting us lost, but I could always find my way back to familiar territory by locating some type of game trail, ATV trail, tree that I remember from 2006, basically any of one of the thousands of reference points that I have in these woods.  That's extremely important to know for my story.  I haven't gotten lost in those woods in the last ten years, except last Sunday.  
  
It was the 17th of February, and I had just finished having my after-lunch nap.  My dog was giving me the look, so I knew I was going to have to go out into the cold.  I remember I hadn't been outside all day, so when I stepped outside in my usual heavy jacket/ sweater combo, I started sweating.  It was close to 50F, outside, so I stripped my jacket off and left it on a chair in my den (Yeah, I'm kind of fat.)  After I took the first few dozen steps, I remembered that I had left my cell phone in my jacket pocket.  I was thinking about turning around to get it, but I wasn't expecting any important calls, and once when I get in the trees my reception is spotty, at best.  Plus, yeah, I'm kind of fat.  
  
So I start walking on the main trail that leads, just about, from my back door to the main treeline (I've got a bunch of large, old trees that are isolated in the backyard, itself).  I made this trail with a four-wheeler and a bunch of spare time when I was a kid. I made it connect to the one, huge trail that everyone else would ride on.  I continue walking my regular path, and my trail starts to take me into the woods.  If I continue straight, it will take me to the main trail.  If I head right it takes me to a trail that I made that runs parallel, and real close, to my property line (This is the trail that I take back).  
  
I continue straight to the main trail, and make a right at the T to push me farther back into my property.  This trail continues for approximately 6km, twisting and weaving it's way through the woods.  Somehow managing to be on everyone's and no one's property at the same time, if you get my drift.  Not literally, I mean.  It's just everyone's 4-wheeler trail that they use when the kids from out-of-town are over, and no one else gets upset because it's not in their back yard.  However, I'm the only person who walks it 2-3 times a day.  
  
My dog (A Brittney Spaniel), was doing her usual thing.  Which consists of staying about twenty meters away from me at all time, and occasionally running by at high speed to say hello.  She's incredibly chipper for being thirteen.  Anyway, we keep walking down the main trail.  There's a few trails that branch off to the sides, but I know where every single one goes, and only one deviates from the main trail and goes to someone else's house about 1.5km away.  Right before that is my trail that runs parallel to my property, that I mentioned earlier.  
  
I'm not going to sit here and lie to you, this was some completely F#@$3D shit that happened in the time span of about 90 seconds.  First off, my dog does her usual thing.  Which is, the moment I turn down to trail to go home, she takes off trotting and gets home about five minutes before me.  I don't know why she does it, but she does.  Just as I'm turning onto the trail, watching my dog disappear into the woods in front of me I caught movement out of the left side of my vision.  Thinking that it was a deer, squirrel, fox, rabbit, coyote, opossum, raccoon, or some other forest denizen, I casually cocked my head and immediately stopped.  
  
My neighbor's eighteen year-old kid is standing not twenty feet away from me, with his head down.  I didn't even know what to do, I just grunted and stared at him for twenty seconds.  Thinking that he's going to at least acknowledge my presence.  Finally, I can't take it anymore and shout his name at him.  No response.  
  
My head started swimming, and I looked around for something familiar to grasp onto.  I was in full flight or fight.  I could see my dog looking at me about 100 meters away in the woods, and it looked like she was coming back.  I remember that, vividly.
 
I looked back at him, and his back was to me.  He hadn't made a sound in the process -* I'm sorry, I want to stop right there.  I just heard a really loud thump outside my window.  It could be deer fighting, or god knows what.  I've got a Taurus Judge loaded with 3"" .410 Hollowpoint Slugs and 2 1/2"" .410 PDX Shells, so I think I'm fine.*-.  Sorry.  He didn't make one sound in the process of turning around.  He would have had to of made some type of noise.  Me trying to walk stealthily in the woods still makes a few twig pops and leave rustles.  I had only turned my head for what felt like two seconds.  In order to turn around that fast, we would have made a bunch of noise.  His head was still down.  
  
This is, kind of.  Well, f--k.  I'm tearing up right now, just thinking about it;  I'm a twenty-six year old man.  I felt something tug.  When I write the word ""tug"" I want to write it in all caps.  I've never felt anything like it before.  It was the opposite of what you would sometimes feel as you drift off to sleep; That feeling of weightlessness.  This was the exact, terrible opposite.  It felt like I was falling out.  I can't f--king explain it.  I'm sorry.
 
When I opened my eyes, I could tell something had changed.  The neighbor wasn't standing there, anymore.  It was darker, but not in the sense that it was suddenly overcast, or the the sun had went down.  It felt like a solar eclipse.  I couldn't even sense where the sun was coming from.  There was a little more snow on the ground than there had been before.  I don't remember why that sticks out to me, it must be because I'm associating it with the fog.  It was slightly foggy that day from the snow melting, but I couldn't see more than twenty meters out, now.  
  
It felt like the woods were alive with something that did not want me there, and I never wanted to witness.  I remember dark shapes moving out of order, in the fog.  Trees that weren't really trees, because trees don't slightly shift from side to side.  
  
I stood there looking around for about thirty or forty seconds.  I was completely petrified.  This wasn't the place that I had grown up living at.  This wasn't even someplace that I felt I was supposed to go.  ""Alien"" pops up in my head when I think about this.  Everything felt alien.  When I finally tried to take a step, I felt that tug again.  I was back.
 
I was back on the trail heading to my house.  My neighbor was standing in front of me, smiling.  He asked me how I was doing.  I couldn't respond, at first, but was finally able to kind of choke something out as I extended my hand out to give him a handshake.  He didn't notice anything out of the ordinary.  At this point I started feeling sick.  
  
I remember the kid asking me if I was alright.  He said I looked pale, I told him I was feeling a little under the weather, but okay.  
  
I saw something out of my peripheral vision.  It was my dog, approaching us at an angle with her hackles up.  I haven't seen her like that unless she's squaring off with a particularly nasty raccoon.  Then I looked back at him.  His head was down.  Then I felt a shock.  This is a really hard to explain part, so please try and bear with me.  
  
Picture you're somewhere with a friend of yours that you know likes to joke around a lot.  In mid-conversation, he suddenly pretends to cold-cock you in the jaw with his fist.  But stops before he hits you, and is really fast.  That instinctual ""jump"" that you feel?  That's what I felt, times a hundred.  It felt like the kid had suddenly tried to attack me, but my eyes didn't register anything.  I put my arms up, in defense as I started to step back.  Before I took a step, I realized I was somewhere else.  I was about ten minutes down the trail, at the point where it would connect to ""my"" trail.  I jumped again, in shock.  
  
I looked around.  It felt like I should look around for something, but everything was as it should be.  The woods were completely normal.  I walked around in circles for a few minutes, eventually lighting up a cigarette (I'm trying to quit, and I only smoke 2 or 3 a day.  I've burned through a pack since Sunday.)  After smoking half the cigarette, my dog came trotting down the trail, coming from out of the woods.  Not from the direction of the house.  How did I get ahead of my dog?  
 
Then I threw up a couple times.  I felt dirty.  I rushed down the trail to my house, with my dog in tow.  I locked up, and went into the bathroom and cleaned myself up.  One of my roommates would be home soon, and I could figure everything out with him.
  
When he finally got home, he saw me sitting in my armchair with a glass of whiskey and a cigarette burning in the ashtray.  Not something he would see me doing at four o'clock in the afternoon, unless it's a special occasion.  We talked for awhile, and I think he was starting to understand how I was feeling about what had just happened.  He tried his best to reassure me that I wasn't crazy, but I still felt like I had budding schizophrenia, or something.  
  
We finally decided on a course of action.  He was going to wait for our third roommate to get there in about an hour, then he was going to go over to our neighbor's house, by himself, and ask to talk to their kid.  He was going to hint if anything funny happened, and then he was going to relay the information to me.  A few fingers of whiskey and a few smokes later, my other roommate finally arrived and went into her room to get changed and take a shower.  She didn't even notice that I was staring at a television that wasn't on, getting drunk and smoking cigarettes at six in the evening.  Then again, she isn't one of the most attentive people that I've met in my life.  
  
Finally my roommate comes back and looks shocked.  He sits down next to me and starts telling me the story.  He walked over to the house, which is a good walk away, and rang the doorbell.  He could see that no one's car was there, except for his kids two cars and the broken down Monte that's been sitting there since I was a kid.  After waiting for almost a minute, he told me, the door opened a little bit.  Only about three or four inches, he told me.  He said, ""Hello?"" to the cracked door, and reached his hand out to push it open, thinking that the neighbor had popped it open and walked back to whatever task he was doing.  Just as his hand was going to graze the knob, the door opened quickly, to the image of my neighbor's kid standing there with his back facing my friend.  He said his head was down.  He said ""Hello"" a few more times, thinking that the kid must be playing a joke on us.  Finally pushing the kid.  He told me the kid pushed over like he was dead, and fell to the floor.  Before he could react, the door slammed shut in his face.  He started ringing the doorbell and pounding on the door like a madman.  He tried the knob, it was locked.  
  
Finally, the house's caretaker opened the door, glaring at my friend like he was insane.  My neighbor's daughter is in need of constant medical attention, due to an unfortunate accident, so there is always someone there looking after her.  My friend asked if the kid was home, and she said that he hadn't gotten dropped off from work yet, saying that his car was broke down.  
  
That's all the information that my friend has relayed to me.  He doesn't want to talk about it much, and both of us have been on edge all week.  It doesn't seem like my neighbors would try to pull a trick on me, they know that I'm not the type of person who likes to be messed with.  I absolutely know that my roommate isn't messing with me, because he's been my best friend since for the last twenty years, and is the closest thing to a brother that I've got.  
  
This has been screwing with my brain for the entire week.  I don't know what to do, right now.  I've been taking my dog out for her regular walks, and nothing odd has happened to me.  My roommate says that he's having trouble sleeping at night, but I have to admit, so am I.  I'm at my wits end, Reddit.  What the f--k happened?  We've seen the next-door neighbor's kid, since then, but we haven't had a chance to talk to him.  We've just seen him coming down the road with his car.  
  
I'm hoping someone here can help me with this.  I don't even know what to do.  Right now, this is encompassing my entire life.  If you've read along this far, let me say thank you.
 
TL;DR - I took my dog for a walk.  Saw my neighbor's kid acting weird in the middle of the woods.  Almost ""blacked-out"" and woke up several minutes down the trail, ahead of my dog.  Roommate saw the neighbor's kid acting odd that day.  I'm freaking out.

Science is all about keeping one's mind open to various things, which leads me to experiment with fringe science and odd theories. (For example, I have done some research on Bubble Fusion)

Basically my proposal is this : can you guys give me your most likely paranormal phenomenon, or the one with the most evidence other than circumstancial, for me to study? 

I would basically do research on the subject and attempt to find a plausible explanation to inscribe it under, or publish on the lack of such an explanation.

Now, this is where it gets interesting for you guys. If I end up finding that a phenomenon can not be explained by modern physics, I, and some contacts I have would likely publish a paper on that phenomenon, hereby further advancing the cause for understanding paranormal phenomena. 

Basically, this is about giving you a chance to prove the paranormal, or at least make it known.

So what do you say, /r/Paranormal 

Also, on a throwaway because of the repercussions of this sort of things getting out. It's sad that more researchers can't be inclined to experiment with some things other than mainstream science.

EDIT : (05 Jul. 5:18PM) I have decided to go explore the world of EVP, on which very physical analysis has already given plausible results.

You guys can keep posting, so that if someone has the same will to do some research, they will be able to find a starting point, as I did.

I'll keep you guys posted.

I'm home alone today.  Both roommates are at work and my boyfriend, who has a key, is out of town.  I was in the bathroom when I heard my phone ringing.  I was going to call back whomever was calling me.  It stopped ringing about halfway through, but I brushed it off.  I heard some thumping in my room, which sounded like my dog wagging her tail against my furniture.



I got out of the bathroom and checked my phone, which showed no missed calls.  Weird, but it has done that before.  Most recent call shows my mom calling me, and that I answered, which I didn't.  I called her back, and she said yes, I did answer.  ""We"" spoke for about two minutes.  She says I sounded like myself, but maybe with a sore throat.  She says I promised to make some soup and take it easy.



I grabbed my dog, and high-tailed it out of there.  I'm at a friend's house right now.  I just needed to share.  I'll go home once my roommates get off work.


**UPDATE**



Here are some answers to some general questions:

If my dog had seen a stranger, she would have more than likely been jumping on him and giving love, rather than growling.  If he had been trying to hurt me, though, she would have hurt him.  When I came out of the bathroom, she was acting pretty normal.

I honestly do not know if somebody was in my house.  We're all usually very good about keeping the doors locked throughout the day, and the windows stay closed.  It's possible that the door was unlocked, or maybe someone picked the lock and got inside.  Either way, I didn't see anybody, and nothing immediately struck me as out of place.

I went to the doctor and he gave me a clean bill of health.  I'm not on any medication (not even antidepressants, for the person who asked), and I haven't had a head injury.



There was no evidence of a break-in, and nothing had been stolen.  My roommates and I have been staying with friends for the past week.  We decided to try and go home last night, but none of us are comfortable staying in that house anymore.  



Whether my experience was a stalker, an attempted theft, rape, or kidnapping, or a paranormal experience, we are all too scared to stay.  We're planning on selling our house and gettin' outta dodge.  One roommate is moving to be closer to her job, one roommate was planning on getting her own place anyway, and as of yesterday afternoon, my boyfriend has become my fiance (:D).  I will be moving in with him, and taking my dog.

1360081969.0,175,self.Paranormal,17xt4p,Slept with a ghost at Ohio university. ,Ratfat,214,39,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/17xt4p/slept_with_a_ghost_at_ohio_university/," So going into this I'm going to tell you that this story is probably going to sound pretty strange, but I've never really believed in ghosts and you should know that. This happened years ago too.


So 4 years ago I was attending high school in central Ohio, and I developed a huge crush on one of my best friends, her name was Lara. Nothing really happened but I was extremely attracted to her and we would spend the night together, but only as friends. She went off to school in New York and I never really saw her again. 
 

 A few weeks after she left I went to go visit another one of my friends at Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. It's about 2 1/2  hours away but my buddy and I always have fun, so its worth it. It's supposedly one of the most haunted places in America but I didn't really believe that. Anyways I get there and my buddy is living in the dorm called Crawford and he lived on the fourth floor. We chill for a bit and do some light drinking but nothing really major happens. At this point it's about 1 am and we are getting ready for bed and I'm exhausted after driving and working earlier that day. 

 We go to bed and my buddy tells me to sleep in his roommates bed that hasn't moved in yet, it's the top bunk and I'm secretly afraid of heights. I had a hard time falling asleep, I was really concerned I would fall off the bed most of the night. 

 I finally manage to calm myself down and go to sleep, it's about 3 am at this point and I wake up to someone spooning me. I was really confused and I asked who it was and I heard a girl whisper in my ear and say ""it's Laura, you're safe, go back to sleep."" I thought it was strange that her name was Laura since I didn't know any, but I assumed my mind ment my friend Lara. I thought it was really weird since nothing like that had happened before or since but I just kind of shrugged the next morning and I just assumed I was being a little obsessive about my crush so I didn't tell anyone. 

Fast forward a couple months and my friend tells me that apparently his dorm is haunted by a girl who fell out of her 4th story window and died. I question his story but I did look into it and apparently some girl did die, and her name was Laura.

Here's a link to the story: http://www.forgottenoh.com/ou/ou.html


I was freaked out but I guess that she just tried comforting me. Maybe I slept in her old room, I'm not sure but it's always something I've questioned. ",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_17xt4p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/17xt4p/slept_with_a_ghost_at_ohio_university/,

AMA.,Badk1d,212,42,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/13cl14/my_apartment_was_haunted_by_something_that_i_can/,"First some background on me, as to establish some basic human credibility before I recount the events that have caused me immense anxiety and depression. I'm now a 21 year old male student at Long Beach State, looking to graduate in Political Science this coming spring. I'm also an alumni member of a fraternity on campus. I don't do drugs, and during the course of these events, I used marijuana once.

In Mid January 2011, my best friend Ryan (fraternity pledge brother) and I looked to move out of the fraternity house (in hopes of bringing some form of normalcy back to our lives). We found an apartment for rent in our price range, $1200 for a two bedroom in downtown Long Beach so we followed up and made it happen.

The day after we moved in, something strange happened. I went to take my second shower since moving in, and five minutes into it, was greeted by my neighbor from downstairs complaining that massive amounts of water were leaking into her unit from ours. I checked the water heater and found water gushing from an emergency release valve on the top, which is never supposed to be opened.

A few weeks later, late February, I come home from my crappy job at the CSULB Bookstore to find my roommate locked out on our second story balcony. He knocks on the glass door and I let him in. I think it's hilarious and ask him how long he was locked out for. Turns out he was locked out for 6 hours! Because his right arm was in a splint from shoulder surgery, he wasn't able to climb down. He also didn't have his cellphone. He told me that he swore the door was unlocked when he went our for a cigarette. We agreed it was kind of strange but laughed about him being stuck out there for 6 hours.
A few days later, Ryan offers me a bowl to celebrate our new lives away from the frat house. I don't often smoke pot but I decide it would be fun. 

I go to bed 45 minutes later and out of nowhere I am the most terrified I have ever been in my life. I felt a strange sensation and I had the overwhelming feeling that there was some manifestation of negative energy in my room. I was hearing thoughts that were not mine, and they were not pleasant. My closed door was bouncing back and forth, so I closed my windows. It continued. 

I frantically grab my phone from the window seal to text Ryan in the next room. My phone shows one new text so I click the message box but there is no new text message. Convenient time for an Iphone glitch, right? Ryan tells that I need to calm down and go to bed. For those interested, here is a link to the text conversation from that night: http://imgur.com/a/lzXE0

The next morning I wake up, and convince myself that it was all the result of smoking that bowl and go about as usual.
A few weeks went by before one day when I'm at work and get a text from Ryan saying that he's locked out again.  Conversation is here http://i.imgur.com/zApb8.png . So I leave work early to get home and let him in. When I got home and let him in, he was a little freaked out. He told me that this time he left the door cracked open a few inches and that it slammed shut on it's own and latched right after (to latch this heavy glass sliding door, you must push the lock UP against gravity). We were both pretty disturbed but for the next few weeks we went about our lives.
On March 15, 2011 I went home after my classes and discovered Ryan's room completely torn apart. It looked like the place had been ransacked. There were clothes everywhere, items knocked over...His heavy wooden desk had been completely knocked over and the pencil tray had been pulled all the way out and dumped. It looked like a fuckin tornado came through. I look through the glass door and see Ryan locked out on the balcony, and he starts banging on the glass... ""Chris let me in man....hurry up let me the fuck in....."" I open the door for him and the first thing he says to me is ""bro all of this shit happened while I was out there....I FUCKING WATCHED as my room was completely torn apart by some invisible force for half an hour...""
He swears that he went out for a smoke, and that this time he left the door half way open....he hears the door begin sliding shut on its own...so he grabs it as quick as he can and catches it before it closes, but the force of the door was too strong and actually pulled him with it. Ryan swears that as he smoked his way through a full pack of cigarettes, he watched as his room was ransacked by some invisible force. I was freaked the fuck out, and wanted nothing more then to gtfo out of there and never go back. I told Ryan that I thought we should both get out of the apartment for a while, but he just wanted to clean his room and ignore it. (His tough guy attitude toward the situation was typical). http://imgur.com/a/FtQNt


I couch surfed for about a week before regaining the courage to go back and face this thing.
The weeks and months that followed were among the worst of my life. Any peace of mind that I had in my own bedroom was lost. When I wanted to fall asleep, strange things would start happening. My closed door would start shaking back and forth, and occasionally I would hear a violent bang on the door. It got to the point where I would put my shoes up against the door to stop it from banging back and forth...then one morning I woke up and found that one of those shoes had been moved to the other side of the room.
Ryan would go home to San Diego on the weekends, which meant that I was often there alone. I would often hear footsteps on my carpet next to me as I tried to fall asleep, and I would sense overwhelming negative energy. In short, when it was around our apartment, I could feel it. I would get goosebumps out of nowhere and I could just sense it. It was a very strange sensation and I'm afraid I cannot quite effectively describe it to you. My sleeping habits deteriorated and my grades began to drop like stones. We didn't know how to deal with it so we started to ignore it....but I can tell you that It was very difficult to ignore. I found that it was nearly impossible for me to fall asleep before 2am, no matter how hard I tried. Something would always keep me up. The growling sound was the worst. It was low pitched, and extremely creepy. For a while I thought it was an airplane but after going outside and not being able to hear the sound, I concluded that the source was indeed inside the apartment.
I'm having trouble piecing the rest of the events in order so I will just list some of the creepy shit that happened:
During the day in mid April, Ryans girlfriend, Taylor came over. We were trying to put a movie in the xbox when the power went out. To our surprise, the power outage was restricted to our two bedrooms and not the rest of the apartment. Strange. We decided to play uno on the carpet in the main room. While playing, we all 3 heard the sound of something sliding across our tile counter top in the kitchen ... I go to investigate and find that it was their bottle of Andre champagne (classy, I know.)
A few weeks ago, days before we broke our lease and moved out, I was home alone again and in my room on reddit. I look across the room at my macbook charger and notice that it was moving on its own, back and forth and making strange shapes like it was alive. I left the room and went into the kitchen. I opened the cupboard and discovered that my unopened box of honey bunches of Oates (bomb, I know) had been torn open and the bag had been pulled out at a very strange angle. Decided to leave and spend the night at the fraternity house.
I have many more accounts of strange events that occurred while living there, and I may post some of them in the comments section.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1353156071.0,,,True,t3_13cl14,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/13cl14/my_apartment_was_haunted_by_something_that_i_can/,

1334196860.0,161,self.Paranormal,s5gy8,r/Creepy said I should post this here,pielover375,196,35,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/s5gy8/rcreepy_said_i_should_post_this_here/,"About a year and a half ago, I responded to a house fire at an old farmhouse. It was falling apart. There were some rusty old tractors in the barn, and a dried up lake behind an over-grown field. I was on the first arriving engine, and the Chief put a Lieutenant, another firefighter, and myself on the search team to run a primary. We went in to find the house was totally empty, but we had to search anyway in case there were any squatters. We were on our way out when I heard crying and coughing coming from a closet in a second-floor bedroom. I threw open the door to find a little girl, about four years old. I grabbed her and right when I turned around, I heard the air horn sound three times, which means ""the structure's coming down, get the hell out"". I scooped up the little girl and ran towards the door, but I wasn't fast enough and the house came down around us.

I lay in the rubble, clinging the body of the girl to my chest. My pass device wasn't ringing, it would take hours- if not days- to find us. I took of my air mask and held it to her face. She didn't stir. I took off a glove to feel for her pulse, but there was none. I now lay alone, buried in rubble. I pulled the picture of my fiancee out of my helmet to see her face one last time. A tear rolled out of my eye before I closed it to wait for the sweet embrace of death.

I felt warm sunshine on my face and a small foot nudging my head. I opened my eyes and a saw a dirty, sweaty, but very much alive little girl. ""Come on!"" she said, ""We have to get to the ferry!"" I gave her a confused look. ""It's leaving soon! Get up!"" I stood up slowly and looked around. There was a farmhouse- very much not on fire- and a barn, and a vast ocean behind a neatly manicured soybean field. ""That's funny,"" I thought, ""Salt water would kill those soybeans."" I looked around for another house, or another person, or the road, any sign of civilization, but there was only the girl and me. ""Let's go!"" She took off into the soybeans. I had to follow her, of course- we'd come this far. I couldn't abandon her now. I took off my airpack and my turnout coat, and walked with her. ""What's your name?"" I asked. She looked up at me with coal-black eyes. They weren't scary, just very sad. She started crying. ""I- I don't know,"" she said through her sobs. ""I'm lost... I just want to go home. Please take me home?"" ""I'll do my best,"" I replied. I was trained never to lie when confronted with a question like this. If a victim asks if they're going to die or a similar question, you reply with the truth. ""I'll do my best."" A small smile crossed her face and she grabbed my hand. She was warm. We walked to the boathouse at the end of the dock. A man and a woman jumped off the bench outside, and embraced the little girl. She screamed. ""Mommy! Daddy!"" The man got up and shook my hand. ""Thank you, hero. For bringing our daughter back to us."" He and his wife had the same coal-black eyes as their daughter. ""We'll bring cookies to the station some time."" I smiled and said I was just doing my job. The boatman- a Mark Twain looking man- came out and asked for tickets. The family was admitted, but I didn't have my ticket. The boatman scowled, and said I'd have to catch a later ferry. That my ride was waiting for my back at the house. I walked back alone and gathered up my stuff. There was a horsecart waiting there, and the driver smiled at me. ""Let's go home, hero."" I jumped up into the cart and we took off.

""I got him! He's alive!"" My lieutenant. He pulled me onto a backboard. ""Are you ok?"" ""I'm fine. I'm good to go."" ""You're a fucking moron, is what you are. Never lose your crew!""

I had a concussion, a broken leg, and three cracked ribs, but I wasn't going to die and I could still fight fires. When I got out of the hospital, I married my fiancee. We had a beautiful little girl about a year later. When I went to put my daughter's picture next to the one of my wife in my helmet, I found another one that I hadn't put there. It was a man, a woman, and their daughter- the same ones from the ferry. Their eyes weren't black. The next day, I showed up for a call and there was a plate of chocolate chip cookies on the table. No one knew where they came from, but they tasted good. To this day, returning that little girl to her family is the one rescue I'm proudest of. And, when it's time for me to get on the ferry, I won't be afraid.

1359092359.0,158,self.Paranormal,178pb7,"Strange happenings at a friends house. Details inside... Multiple, long stories. ",ReDdiT_JuNkBoT,204,46,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/178pb7/strange_happenings_at_a_friends_house_details/,"This started as a comment in another subreddit and I was told to post it here for all to see. The stories are all from either my own eyes or that of very close friends that have been in this house over the years. Most of this had taken place between approximately 6-10 years ago. 

To begin, this is at one of my close friends house in middle Tennessee. Many family members of his have lived here since the ""incident"" and all recall very weird things going on throughout the years. Ill start with my experiences, which took place after some of the others in this post. 

I was at a friends house one night hanging out. I passed out on the couch watching tv. When I woke up, I realized that I needed to go home because I had to work early am. I noticed that my friend who owned the house (JL as referred from here on) was in his room with the door shut and light on. I got up and told him that I was leaving because I had to work. Through the door he said ""YUP, SEE YA."" I then went to the fridge to grab my drink and walked back by the door and said ""See ya later!"" ""YUP!"" He replied. But something didn't seem legit. It didn't really sound like him. So I opened the door... No one was in there. No one was in the house at all. I called his cell and he said he had left to go to McDonald's about 10-15 minutes prior. I freaked the fuck out and bolted out the front door. I sat on his front porch until he got home a few minutes later. I told him what happened and he started telling me about the house. Apparently, quite a few years earlier there was a family that lived there and had a few kids. One of those kids, at a relatively young age, ""hanged"" himself (thanks /u/menwithaven) in the upstairs of the house. He then began to tell me his stories and that of his family. 

JL's brother used to live there before JL did and apparently his now ex wife was very into black magic. She did the rituals in living room from time to time. One of the stories I was told from him was that they once saw a tall skinny woman with long black hair, red eyes and claws for hands. Apparently, she didn't like the wife because she kept showing herself to her with a scarier appearance each time. They believe the reason they had 5 miscarriages was due to something she did to piss this spirit off. On more than one of the miscarriages the wife awoke with sharp pains in her stomach and bad scratch marks around her throat and across her stomach. I was told that spirit, in some way or fashion, made it know that she liked the husband and would go crazy if the wife and husband slept in the same bed. Things would fly across the room, doors open and shut randomly and so on. When they slept in separate rooms, everything was fine. Well finally, one day the husband and wife decided to have a priest come over and check things out. The priest entered the front door and it slammed shut behind him. I was told he noticed some of the ""black magic"" items she used on the mantle (i know nothing about black magic btw. Sorry if I don't  know what things are called) He immediately turned pale white and told them they are on their own and because of what she had been doing in the house there was nothing he could do to help them. He left and never again returned any of their phone calls. The husband eventually developed a bad cocaine habit and the two split up and moved out of the house. That's when JL moved in. The husband also told me that when he moved to his new house down the block that the same spirit ""followed"" him to the new house and showed herself to him a number of times, but he stated that she wasn't as ""dark or demonic"" more like just a random spirit wanting to hang out. He later moved out of country. He straightened out his life and a few years ago he was actually in training to become a priest. 

So, back to the original house that my friend JL moved into after his brother moved out. He always knew of the stories but didn't believe in that sort of shit and didn't think much about it (??) it didn't take long before he changed his mind. JL said that after a few weeks of moving in weird shit started going on. Banging on the walls, when just he was there, voices saying his name and things randomly moving from place to place about the house. His girlfriend moved in and immediately she started to notice shit. One particular story that stands out was that one time she was taking a bath an she had the radio sitting on the sink. All of a sudden the radio turned off. She turned it back up. It went back off. She turned it back up again and it stayed on for a minute. She closed her eyes and laid there. She then said she heard someone whisper ""TURN IT DOWN"" in a quiet stern voice. She opened her eyes and there stood a young man with dark wavy hair and glasses. She sat up in the tub quickly and he was gone. Just like that. No one else was home. She freaked the fuck out and grabbed some clothes and bolted to a friends house. Later that day when she told JL what happened he called his brother and described what happened. His brother told him to go across the street and talk to the old man that lived there and tell him everything that had happened. JL did and as he was describing the young man that his gf had seen the old man abruptly walked away an grabbed an old picture from the living room and showed it to them. The gf broke into tears and said that that was the guy she saw! The old man told them that the picture was his brother who had hanged himself in the upstairs of that house many years ago!  (This was before I had my first experience that I told earlier in the story) 

Another story of mine, JL, myself and another friend were hanging out in the living room. We decided we were going to stay the night because we lived a little ways away. JL went to his room and shut the door to go to bed. I was on one couch and my friend on the other. As we lay there all of a sudden it sounded like someone had dropped a bowling ball from the top step of the upstairs (after JL learned of the suicide he always kept the door leading upstairs shut with things in front of it, no one ever went up there and a lot of his brothers shit was left there after the divorce). We heard whatever it was bang loudly down the steps until the upstairs door flew open and crashed into the wall behind it moving all the stuff that was in front of the door out of the way. We were shocked and just looking at each other with blank faces. JL came out of his room and said ""WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU GUYS DOING IM TRYING TO SLEEP!""  He saw our faces and instantly knew it wasn't us that made the noises. We both pointed at the upstairs door. He nervously went and shut the door and yelled ""I WISH YOU WOULD LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE!""  It's was eerie but calm the rest of the night. I was scared. I won't lie. I didn't sleep and neither did the other friend. 

Another time we were there watching tv and partying one night. There were quite a few of us friends there. JL had pictures and vases on the mantle for decoration. As we all sat there drinking and what not, out of nowhere, one of the glass vases flew off the mantle and shattered on the wall behind me nearly hitting me. I wigged out. Bad. Shortly after we all left and went to a bar instead where at least we could see the people throwing stuff at us. I haven't been back to the house since. This was probably 4+ years ago. 

I haven't talked to JL about a year or more. (I moved a few hours away until about 2 or 3 days ago we got in contact with each other. We started talking about some of the crazy shit that happened there and he told me a few new stories. (Yes ! He still lives there with his new gf and his son! He went through some rough times and moved his son and himself in with his mom for a while and went back to the house a couple years ago)(house is owned by his family btw I believe a great aunt is the deed holder)

This was a really old house and JL had learned that it had lead paint covering the walls and he wanted to make it ok for his son to live in so he decided to remodel, including the upstairs. They got all the furniture and stuff out and started scraping the paint (using respirators of course) and decided to knock a few walls out to make more room. Upon doing so as they were knocking out a wall in the back JL noticed a man standing there... Just staring at him and shaking his head. He took his respirator off and he was gone. While remodeling the upstairs and moving all of his brothers stuff out he noticed it sounded like people were walking on the roof, which to him was great since he told his now gf to call a roof guy to give an estimate on new shingles. Except when he went outside to see them.... No one was there. Many people at the house that day witnessed this. He says from time to time he still hears his name being called from the other room. One day his son (6yo) were watching tv and they heard a woman call JL's name. He looked at his son and said ""Did you hear that?"" He son said ""Yes daddy"". JL said ""Who did that sound like?"" son replied ""AM"" (current gf). He got up and looked no one was there and he knew AM was at work. He said that happens a lot. He also remembered seeing the man that was shaking his head at him, during the wall removal, standing on the railroad tracks near the house as he walked outside one day. Again he just stared, shaking his head and vanished. 

Well that's all I can remember right now and I will talk to him again soon and update this post with anymore stories. I plan to go visit him soon as I haven't been to the house in a few years.

Glad I got to share this with you all.

1343620020.0,154,self.Paranormal,xdh5i,My mother received a voicemail from my grandmothers landline phone and it is pretty disturbing.,midwayer,194,40,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/xdh5i/my_mother_received_a_voicemail_from_my/,"Hello r/Paranormal, I would like some help with this voicemail my mother received this morning at around 11:30am. Here is some background information:
My grandmother lives alone in an old house that my mother and her two sisters grew up in. When they were children the house was supposedly haunted by spirits. My mother was haunted by a voice that would call her name ""Judy"" from the bathroom, her sister Gina would speak in tongues at times. It got to the point where they had a priest come in and cleanse the house. Other than a few odd occurrences there was nothing too major, and it happened so long ago that it doesn't concern my family anymore. (sorry trying to keep this short)

So today my mother calls me and asks if I pranked her by leaving her a creepy voicemail. I explain to her that I didn't, and ask who was the last person to call her. She had two missed calls from my grandmother before the message, and when I finally made it to my mothers house to listen to the message I found that it did indeed come from my grandmothers house. We called my grandmother and she told us that she did not leave any message, and my mother even went over her house durning the day to ask her about the message and she was told that there was no way she left a message on her phone. The message is not static but seems more glitchy, but there is a dominant low voice that seems to say my mothers name slowly ""Juuuuddyyy"" at times. its 50 seconds long and repeats. I brought my friends over because they love the supernatural so we came over to see what we could investigate, and to help my mother put because she is extremely religious and emotional. I figured out how to send the message to my own phone and then uploaded it to my computer where I have some software that can enhance the sound clips. Every time I listen to it I get shivered down my back, and I wanted to see what anyone else thinks of this. 
I have uploaded the original voicemail to an mp4 on mediafire. I am not sure if there is an easier way to share this, if there is please let me know but the link to download the file is here:

This is for the descendants of Harriett and William Bickford, who lived in a home called by most ""The Old Bickford Place.""  I was not told the names of the descendants, so I am just going to throw this out and see if anyone recognizes any of this, and pass along the message. 

The message came in a dream, and this is what I saw and the message I am supposed to send. 

The house is a multi-story (2.5?) brick georgian style with a mansard roof. There are columns on a small porch, with cement steps. While standing facing the front porch, to the right is a 'reflecting pool' that had been built in memory of a family member who passed away. An art-nouveau (maybe even Victorian?) statue of a woman sits at the edge, legs folded under her, leaning over looking mournfully down into the water. 

To the right of the pool is a brushy tall undergrowth that blocks the view to the next lot over. In the next lot over is a machinery shop/automechanic shop. The shop consists of two buildings: the main shop which looks like what a convenience store may have looked like in the 20's - an office but also a place to buy a Co-cola and a packet of peanuts or stuff like that, and the other is a separate wood garage structure with four bay 'doors', though they don't have doors per se - they are just openings. The man working here is roughly in his sixties, and I saw one or two Mexican men in his employ there. When the owner saw me out there peeking in the garage, he ran me away. That is when I walked back toward the house. 

Standing in the yard by the reflecting pool and facing down the road to the left, I can see past the machinery/autobody shop and can see a bridge there: not a big one, one of those small bridges you see in rural areas: a flat expanse going over a small river, if not a big creek. 

Looking back to the house, there is a strange juxtaposition - the house as they want me to see it is superimposed over how it looks now: the home was once a red brick with white trim on the porch/stoop. Black shutters, white columns (four of them, two are in front of and slightly down from the other two). White concrete steps. Fluctuating with this image is a crumbling wreck of what used to be that house, blackened brick, shattered windows, no shutters, roof caved in. The reflecting pool is the same. They want me to see how beautiful it was, but over that image is an overgrowth and weeds in the yard growing over the broken statuary and choking the dank water. You'd never know that pool was there. 

The machine shop didn't change. It is an old place and hasn't changed much, but it looks like it does to this day. White painted wood, peeling in spots, packed dirt in the yard between the two buildings. 

The reason I was contacted was that the machinery/automechanic shop is buying the land that the Old Bickford Place is on and razing the ruins that are left. 

There is someone still at the Old Bickford Place: Harriett (emphasis on the 'yett') Bickford, wife of William Bickford. They are both dead, but William is not there. Harriett knows that when the house is razed, she will be gone too and that is why she wants me to pass along a message. 

I walked up to the house, and walked in looking at the beautifully polished old railings and enjoying the silence broken only by the creaking and settling of the old house. Until, that is - I get to a room on the top floor. There are several rooms up there. One of them is William's. His room shows that in his life, he was an avid sportsman and hunter. There are old guns mounted on the walls, decoys here and there, memorabilia from past hunts, rustic paintings of various scenes. His room is quiet, tranquil - a portrait of his past. He is not here. I sense nothing but memory. 

The other room, Harriett's - is like walking into pure rage-filled static. I can hear the pops and squeals of angry static in my head, though there is very little in the room. Walking into the door, there is the left wall less than two feet from the door and the right wall is maybe fifteen feet from the door. In that corner is Harriett's chair, an uncomfortable looking fairly modern chair that adjusted. It was not a recliner, rather something that looked more like you would see in a nursing home: white plastic with blue parts. The chair was vibrating and shaking in the corner, and I knew she was there. I couldn't see her, but I could feel her and hear her rage. Beside the chair sat a woman at least in her 80s, and a younger woman in her early 50s - long straight blonde hair with a plain face, a bit heavyset. They are who I'm supposed to give the message to. 

They are trying to lead me to William's room, determined that the source of the haunting was coming from there. They did not see or sense the rage coming from Harriet's room. I finally had to lead them back to Harriet's room. I was being threatened in some unspoken way by Harriet, feeling her anger and rage. I knew at the point on some level that I was dreaming, so I wasn't afraid. I walked to the chair, picked it up and awkwardly started rocking the chair back and forth like a baby. Then, just like that - there she was: a reddish haired toddler, rocking and being comforted. Somehow I knew through what she 'thought' to me that she was acknowledging the fact that at the end of her life, she was angry, mean and spiteful to her daughter and granddaughter, and gave them some impression that it was William's (her husband) fault. 

The message was simple: ""Tell them it isn't William's fault"". Though she didn't have the words for it, basically the gist was that she had dementia, and in her generation there was no word for 'Alzheimers' - she had devolved into the equivalent of an angry and frustrated toddler, with no way to articulate her fear or her anger. She wanted them to know that she was sorry, that she was sorry for letting them think it was William's fault (evidently she told them he did something to her, or they thought he did something to her to make her the way she ended up but she did not elaborate), that she understood that she pushed them away by being a hissing, anger-spitting, spiteful, hateful woman there at the end. 

When the house is torn down completely and everything is burned off and bulldozed over, she will be gone, and there will be no chance to get that message out. If you recognize any of this, consider passing along the message. It may lead to nothing, but at the very least I will feel better knowing I at least made an effort.

Here is a [rough map of the property layout.](http://i.imgur.com/EG2fS.png) 

**TL;DR** = If you are a descendant of William and Harriett Bickford (born I'm guessing in the 1850s or 60s), Harriett says to say ""It wasn't William's fault"" and that her mean and spiteful behavior toward the end was due to illness and nothing more.

To this day I'm unsure of how it all came to be.

The story begins at my Texas high school. My mother had agreed to drop my best friend off at her house after school was over. We piled into the car. My mother drove, I sat in the passengers seat, and my friend sat behind me in the back. The trip from the building to her home was 4.8 miles and took around 15 minutes in mid-day traffic.

We started by turning onto the main road. Around 1 minute into our drive we noticed the end of a red string waving about an inch away of the middle of the windshield. It came from directly in front of us but we couldn't tell from where. There was a school bus ahead of our car, so we assumed a child had dropped the string out. I rolled down my window, reached out and grabbed it. I noticed a very obvious tug back, so I started pulling. We followed the bus for 2.2 miles. During this time we went over a high way and under an underpass. 18 wheelers, trucks and cars were speeding by us on the left. Still, I pulled the string in. By this time I had handed the bulk of string (a baseball sized ball) to the backseat for my friend to hold onto. We turned left, across the busy traffic, onto a new road. I expected the string to follow the bus that was continuing on in the other direction, but instead the string remained in front of us at the same level as the horizon. Everyone shifted in their seats and became quiet. I continued, hand over hand, to pull the string in through my window. All the while the string pulled back. After 1.4 miles we turned again. The string remained. We took a hard right and then a hard left. The string followed the road directly in front of us. It's origins blurred by distance. We took another right onto my friends roads. My friend and I both were pulling as quickly as we could. The string remained taut. It never drooped or gave way. No, it kept straight and pulled back. My mother slowed as we reached the end of the lane. I jumped out of the car, grabbed the string, and continued to gather it in my hands as I ran towards my friends driveway. The string ended there - in the exact center of the gravel drive.

That night my friend and I cut the string in half and each took our handful. My mother says it was by far the weirdest thing that she's ever witnessed.

I wondered if anyone else has ever experienced something like this, or known anyone who has? I read about something called the Red String of Fate, but that's the only thing close to this that I know of.

tl;dr **On the way home from school my mom, best friend and I followed a red string (that seemingly came from nowhere) all the way to my friends driveway where it ended.**

When I was eight or nine years old my family moved into a house that was about 100 years old, beyond fixer-upper. You could see sunlight through my bedroom walls when we first moved in. 

Over the next 5 years we completely remodeled the house and turned it into something beautiful. The house, previously peeling school bus yellow, roof sagging with 5 layers of shingles and refuse piles all around the property, was now a cute dove grey home with flowers and gardens and life. It had been a rent home, we found out, as many friendly locals would randomly stop by and say ""Oh we lived here when I was a kid and it looks so nice now! Can we have a tour?"" Our closest neighbor, a very cranky old woman, had even lived there as a child with her period-appropriate huge family.

The house was surrounded by about 100 acres of Texas plains in any direction between other homes so we were pretty secluded. Being so old it had the understandable character. It had electrical quirks, creaking floors and it rocked as people walked around since it was not on a slab foundation. Rather it was actually propped up on about 2 feet of stacked clay brick. You could crawl under the house like an old barn! The whole house had been floored in all wood but after years of bad tenants it was a lost cause so we just covered it in carpet. 

My bedroom was right off the living room and my parents were in the back of the house (single story) so I never really heard them back there at night. 

When I was about 12 our family was pretty happy. My parents never fought, noone was dying, so there was never any drama to be expected. When I first had an experience I was doing what most teens do; I was staying up really late, dicking around in my room. 

My door was closed, but I heard my mom crying, mournful and soul wrenching sobs.. I thought they were already in bed, and was confused as to what the hell she should be upset over. As I reached my door I could swear I heard the living room floor creaking. It sounded like that slow back and forth groan of a rocking chair... but that couldn't be. We didn't have a rocking chair and the floor didn't creak that loudly because of the carpet. You had to be in the actual room it was squeaking in to hear it. 

I opened my door and since the living room was empty I walked back to my parents closed room. I still heard the crying coming from somewhere, but as I put my ear up to my parents bedroom door I heard both of them snoring. I'm an only child. There was no one else in the house. I sped back to my room and closed myself in, heart racing. I still heard it and the rocking chair sound. I turned my radio on as loud as I could without waking my parents and tried to sleep. I did that for months, and stopped sneaking into the kitchen at night for snacks. I didn't hear it again for a few years. After my parents split when I was 15 I started hearing the same thing about once a month but never had the guts to go investigate further. I moved out when I was 18, never having shared the story.

About 4 years later I was talking to my mom and since she wasn't living alone in the house at the time I told her my story. The color drained out of her face and she looked very shaken. I asked if she had heard it before too. She said after I moved out she had heard it frequently. Then one day she was visiting with the aforementioned cranky neighbor (without mentioning the sounds)who had this story to share.

When Cecil (yeah, what a name!) was 8 (70 years ago) her mother lost her newest baby at 4 months old to crib death. They had a wake and placed the baby's casket in the living room corner and her mother sat in her rocking chair for 3 days, not letting them take the casket to bury the baby. She sobbed and cried almost constantly. Then for the next year she would sit catatonic in the rocking chair and staring out the window. Cecil said she never recovered and died of pneumonia ""and a broken heart"" a week after the one year anniversary of the baby's death. 

TL:DR I heard a woman crying and a rocking chair squeaking in a carpeted empty room, Mom heard it too. Without mentioning the sounds Mom found out from an old neighbor that she had an infant sister die in our home 70 years before and her mother spent a year mourning in a rocking chair in the room and died of a broken heart.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_11g76z,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11g76z/found_out_as_an_adult_that_my_mother_and_i_had/,

True story.,sixfeetunder,141,19,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1983le/i_saw_my_dead_father_true_story/,"Will try and keep this as brief as possible but will keep sufficient details. A little about me. I am 30, male, english and would describe myself as a completely normal, slightly grumpy but otherwise happy and well rounded human being. I am completely non-religious and although I am a literature student, I trust science and consider the universe to be a logical, if mind boggling place.

Anyways, five years ago, my father died. He had had cancer of the stomach for a few years and had gone in to hospital to have most of his digestive system removed in order to remove the cancer. The operation was successful enough and I visited him for a few days while he was recuperating in hospital. I hadn't spent much time with him in the last few years and felt awkward when I was with him at the best of times, despite loving him very much and knowing that he also loved me very much. In short, he was a great dad, kind and generous, but we didn't really know each other that well, no big deal. While he was in hospital it disturbed me how disheartened he became after the operation. I felt incredibly sad for him as he was never going to be able to eat solid food ever again. It was just sad.

One afternoon I went to visit him on the ward and learned that he had been taken to intensive care where he was fighting for his life. A blood clot caused by the operation had blocked a blood vessel and he was in an induced coma. A long, horrible vigil followed where his death was all but certain. By 10 'o' clock the next morning, it was all over and he had died. Devastated and exhausted, I went home, cried a lot and slept.

The next day, (I had been given the day off work) I was smoking lots of cigarettes and generally feeling very sad, but was killing time on my computer, I may even have been looking at porn. It was exactly 1pm and I suddenly felt incredibly tired again. Grieving is surprisingly tiring. I slid off my computer chair and slumped on my bed. 

I lay there for a few moments and suddenly became aware of my fathers presence in my room behind me. Genuine spine chill. I hadn't been in my place long enough for my dad to have ever visited me so it wasn't nostalgia or a memory, I *knew* my father was standing behind me. Bizarrely, next to my head, I could also feel/hear/sense our old family dog, a bullmastiff, long, long dead right next to me, panting away. This dog was much loved and perhaps was the single most important bond our family had ever had. All the happiest times in both mine and I my fathers lives while my brother and I had been children had revolved around adventures we had had with that dog.
Anyway, there I was on my bed, the ghost of my dead father and my old dead dog were there behind me. I know this is such a cliche but it's true. I was paralyzed. I couldn't move a muscle, not even my head. I could smell the familiar 'dad' smell of slightly worn off aftershave and soap that my dad always had. I was scared I must say.

 I croaked: ""Daaaaaaad?"" and as I said it I managed to turn around and I saw him there standing next to my bed smiling at me. (The dog was gone) He was wearing a weird red silky shirt, straight out of the early 90's. He smiled at me but I saw he had tears in his eyes. Tears sprang to my eyes too and then he was gone. No fading away or a blink or a flash he just was, not, there.

All of this, from the moment I lay down on my bed to his disappearance happened in less than 2 seconds, maybe even less than 1.

Apologies if this is a boring story, but it is 100% true. I fully accept that the grieving mind can and will play powerful tricks that someone who has never experienced the profound pain of death simply can't imagine. But I did see my father there that day.

For a year or two afterwards, on occasion I would be alone and think that I felt my dad there with me, I would call out to him but nothing would ever come of it. Then in times of turmoil I occasionally found myself calling out 'Dad?' in the hope that I would get some kind of comfort from him but all I ever felt was a profound feeling of his absence, a certainty that he *was not* there/here with me in any way shape or form. It's this sureness I get of him not being here that makes my sighting, my experience of him the day after he died seem all the more real.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1983le,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1983le/i_saw_my_dead_father_true_story/,
1351085596.0,127,self.Paranormal,12060x,Scratches and letters appearing on GF body over the course of 3 days,christoforever,173,46,227,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/12060x/scratches_and_letters_appearing_on_gf_body_over/,"The story is as follows ... On day one (this past Saturday night 10/20/12) we come home and lock all the doors and head to our bedroom to watch a movie before we go to sleep. Mid-way through the movie GF goes downstairs to grab something to drink. She yells up to me asking why I left all the doors open. I go downstairs to find both our front and back doors completely open. Thinking maybe I did leave them open I close them and we go back upstairs. The following morning I wake up and go downstairs to find both doors completely wide open again. At this point we are really scared and I'm thinking someone has been playing games and possibly breaking in our home (though nothing is stolen). So later that day we change the locks and by some security bars for both doors.
     Later that night (Sunday now and day two 10/21/12) we are playing w/ our children and she says she is feeling a burning sensation on her legs. So her and I go to the bathroom and we see deep scratches (in 3's and 4's) on her legs some of which are slightly bleeding. Now we are little freaked out. Maybe she has something which is causing this but we don't know. So we put our children to sleep and go to sleep ourselves. During the middle of the night she wakes up screaming that something is pulling her hair. After a minute or so she stops screaming and goes right back to sleep. The next morning we look over her and notice that along w/ the scratches there are now bruises all over her legs. We are really upset and scared at this point but continue on with our day so as not to alert or scare the children.
     Later that night (Monday now and day 3 10/22/12) we go upstairs to lay down. Before doing so we check her over for any new marks and don't notice anything. While watching tv and she falls asleep on me. Half hour later (It's about 11:00 pm) she wakes up saying her stomach is burning. We lift her shirt up to find letters (along w/ more scratches) scratched into her abdomen.
     At this point we are really scared and don't know what to do. I take her to the ER and all the doctor's there say they have no explanation. They say the markings look a few days old but I show them the pictures taken each day and they tell me it's impossible given the scarring. The doctors ruled out all the possible medical reasons. We don't know what to do or what could be causing this. We think it may be a spirit of some sort. I've posted an album on imgur of what's taken place:

The most telling picture is the one on her abdomen here:

Can anyone tell what it says or make out a possible name/word? The only thing I can make out is: 'MNIENN'. Feel free to ask any questions as I'll be more than happy to provide answers to try and understand what is going on. Thanks.

EDIT: Thinking the first night she may have been sleep walking I put powder at the foot of our bedroom door and throughout various places along the path to both of our front and back doors. I also put powder on our door handle of our bedroom door. Nothing was disturbed.

EDIT2: We are both from, and currently live, in western Massachusetts.

EDIT3: We are (or at least were) both atheists. She is a doctor and I an engineer.

EDIT4: We did put garlic/rosemary/sage all around our bedroom and burned lavender candles all night last night (which would be the 4th night) and nothing happened. Not sure what this means but it's at least something.

UPDATE (10/24/12): Unbeknownst to me yesterday morning on her way to work she stopped at a family members house (someone we've been confiding too in all of this and someone who is a practicing catholic) who had called in a ""witch"" (sorry I don't know the proper name) to make the negative spirit go away. She was not told the woman's name. She said the woman looked a bit older (60's or later). The woman said that as soon as she walked in the door she could feel the negative energy/spirit with her. The woman said a chant in Spanish and fixed together a drink which my girlfriend described as looking clear-like. She was told to drink all of it. She said it tasted horrible. The rest of the morning/afternoon she was throwing up constantly. Late afternoon she told me she started to feel much better. The woman/witch told her that essentially it's a negative spirit and that whatever door was opened she now closed it and to leave it alone. And that she will be fine and things around the house will start to feel better over the next couple days. Again I don't know what is making the difference here but the disturbances have stopped and things seem to be Ok again.

EDIT:5 We tried to get more information out of the family member, about who this woman is, but she would not budge. She was scared and crying and said only that she deals in these kinds of things when the victim is not of a religious background. I wanted to know what the ""elixir"" is that she was given but the family member did not know and searching the internets has not turned up much.

UPDATE (10/28/12): Exaxtly 1 week to the day the ""disturbances"" have returned. This time it has affected both of us. This past night it, or possibly something less negative, repeatedly tapped us on the head throughout the night. I don't know if its the same spirit/energy or something new.

UPDATE (11/03/12): During the night I was tapped on the head again. No more than 10 minutes later my GF was pinched hard on the leg (enough to wake her up from a dead sleep). A few hours later I woke up to my arm burning and noticed these:

     http://i.imgur.com/QWRqr.jpg

     http://i.imgur.com/fYndX.jpg

It looks like little nips or bites on my arm. I'll continue to update as ""things"" keep happening.

UPDATE (11/08/12 - 11/09/12): A few hours before dawn on both of these nights are youngest daughter (3 1/2 years) woke up asking if we could put her blankets back on her. While walking to her room she said she heard doggy sounds and made the typical doggy ""growl"". When we entered her room we noticed that her blankets had not fallen off her bed but instead were folded neatly on top of her dresser quite a ways away. 

UPDATE (11/11/12 - Daytime): While taking a shower I heard a thump in our room. Opening the door I see one my GF's boots sitting directly in front of the bathroom door. I ran downstairs to tell my GF who was sleeping on the couch and we came upstairs to poke around a bit. Eventually she sits down on our bed and I go back into the bathroom (door open). Directly behind me, and in her sight, is an ironing board we were burning a candle on. Through the reflection in the mirror I saw the candle being forced off the middle of the ironing board and someways off to the side (as opposed to it just falling directly off the board and to the ground). After this we went downstairs and started poking around. As I walked past my basement door, which was locked by the way, it magically unlocked and swung open. So in my brilliance I decide to take a walk downstairs (it should be noted this is not a creepy basement but had in fact been done over by the previous owners and is now a bar and couple bedrooms). About half-way down the door slams shut on me. I run back to the top and open it and see my GF walking over asking why I just slammed the door shut. After telling her it was not me I ask her to hold the door open while I walk downstairs. Again about half-way down my GF is pushed out of the hall-way and into the stairwell. At that moment I grab her and we leave the house.

UPDATE (11/14/12): We have not been sleeping at the house but at friends/families house until this issue is solved. Tonight we had a couple guys from http://www.tmprg.com/ come and check out our place. These guys were great and stayed w/ us for hours explaining everything and anything as well as answering all of our questions. We now have a plan in place on how to proceed for the next couple of weeks and what we can do. Basically document everything from when/where as these things often ""occur"" in patterns and figuring out those patterns can better help us understand what we are dealing with. I will update again in a few weeks w/ how things are progressing (or unless something happens sooner). 

Update(1/20/13): a LOT has happened since last I posted so bare with me while I get this all out.

Before the guys from tmprg came we were put in contact with a local spiritual warfare group associated with a nearby church. They came over and immediately felt them in our house. By them I mean an infestation of demonic spirits (their words not mine). They said these spirits have been here for a while hiding dormant and that for whatever reason us moving into the house woke them up. They said they felt the presence of a leader with many ""soldiers"" underneath it. In their opinion this was entirely demonic as is all types of ""spiritual happenings"". To them anything that is interfering in our lives would be demonic and their is no such thing as ""good"" spirits. In either event they proceeded to remove these entities from our house. Mostly it was calling the creatures out and telling them to leave in Jesus name. One guy was speaking in tongues at one point. When they were done they said nothing should happen again but because of the infestation it's possible they missed a couple and to notify them if anything happens again. As it were things did (and still do) happen again but nothing as crazy as what's already been said. The next week the guys from tmprg were scheduled to come. In between this week there were taps and pinches at night but that's it.

 The following weeks the guys/gals from tmprg came and did an investigation in our house. The sensitive they had with them did note that the ""entity"" was here and it's presence was filling the entire house. At one point while we were all talking (mind you there are 8 strangers in our house at this point) my girlfriend becomes completely drained of energy and proceeds to pass out. I had to help her to the couch. We were unable to wake her for a little while. The sensitive said this does happen and that the entity here was feeding off of her energy. After letting her rest for a half-hour or so we were able to wake her. She also said that the entity hated women, for whatever reason, and particularly my girlfriend who WAS the head woman of our household. She said she felt that it was never human but not demonic in nature only that it was negative. Much different POV then the religious group that came last week. While they were doing the investigation the entity threatened one of the investigators. The lights in our house did flicker on/off a few times. At the end we did a blessing of the house in hopes that it would keep the entities out and make it so they never return.

Not more than a few days later did taps and pinches start happening again. The following week I had the local spiritual warfare guys come back and they also felt the demons were still there but much less powerful/present than before. They did their chanting/yelling to purge it from the house and again said its entirely demonic and that Jesus is the only way to remove it from the house. We were also advised to remove anything negative/ungodly from our house as this could attract them. They specifically noted Harry potter books as the spells inside them can be used in real life to call the enemy. One of their guys who was able to see ""that side"" more so than the others said that in addition to the non-human spirits he saw he was also seeing what was once human spirits walking around. He said he had no way of explaining this or how it fit into the christian religion (because their is only heaven/hell after you die) only that it is what it is.

A few days after they left, pinches and taps were happening again. While the real bad/negative things have stopped nothing either group did has caused it to stop all together. With all this said our fear of everything has dropped substantially and we've simply come to accept it and deal with it. This may have some reason, assuming they feed off of fear, why the big things are no longer happening. There have been scratches recently on her but nothing crazy. I've not heard back from tmprg as to what, if anything, they found while recording audio/video. I'll try and get in contact with them and see if they found anything.

UPDATE: I did eventually get in contact w/ tmprg and they said they found nothing on audio/video recordings while they were here. I unfortunately had them come AFTER the spiritual warfare guys came so the thinking was the sw guys got rid of mostly everything that was here. They did say they ran the letters on my girlfriends chest through all their language programs and the one they were able to come up with, that made any sense was a latin phrase:

     ima ile ei vini

    *which literally translates into english (via google translate) 'lower intestines to wine'

It should be noted that after the 1st time the spiritual-warfare guys came activity decreased substantially. They made sure to point out that when your forcing these entities to leave that you do so ""In Jesus name"". 

UPDATE (2/22/13): We've had a lot more activity recently. Here are the ""highlights"" of the past few weeks:

     -More scratches. Both on my GF's legs and stomach. No written words/letters just scratch marks. There were also minor scratches appearing just above her right breast. Again all of the scratches are preceded by an itching/burning sensation.
     -A small toy was thrown at my GF (hit her on the cheek) after leaving the bathroom one day.
     -One night we both came downstairs into the kitchen to find ALL of the cabinet doors wide open as well as the       bar stools for our bar flipped over and sitting on top of our bar.
     -One night as we were commanding it to leave we walked up our main stair-well which leads to our bedroom, and at the very top she was pushed.
     -It has said ""hey"" or ""hello"" a few times
     -My 50+ pound set of weights was moved from one corner of my bedroom into the front of our bathroom. Once I noticed I put them back and left the room and went downstairs. When I came back upstairs, maybe an hour later, the weights were moved from the corner of the room to just in-front of the bedroom door way.
     -The letter ""M"", as has been prevalent before in our case, was written into the fog of the bathroom mirror.
     -We've seen a tall shadow figure move throughout the house as well as a smaller shadow figure.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1361549961.0,,,True,t3_12060x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/12060x/scratches_and_letters_appearing_on_gf_body_over/,

1355149517.0,120,self.Paranormal,14lrw6,Hide and Seek Alone. (A popular Korean ghost game ... super creepy!),JesusJones207,155,35,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/14lrw6/hide_and_seek_alone_a_popular_korean_ghost_game/,"**I copied this text from another person's blog**

So I heard about this game called ""Hide and Seek Alone"", and it's very popular in Japan and Korea.

And this is basically what it is;

""Playing hide-and-seek alone is pretty popular in Korea and Japan (probably China as well), and it's real-life! There are numerous posts from people who have actually tried this. A lot of people say it works, and that they felt that their lives were threatened.

The meaning of this play is ""If you can find me, you can have my body.""
This ""play"" is necromancy - it is potentially very dangerous. It is not recommended that you do it, even if you're curious. Because if done correctly, this WILL work.
This play is not good for your sanity.

You need:
- A doll with legs. Not a human doll, since there's a great possibilty that the spirit will not leave the doll. Don't use a doll that you like because of the same reason. The doll will be a place for the spirit to come.
- Rice. The spirit that eats this offering is said to grow stronger.
- Red thread. This later symbolizes blood and acts as a restraint.
- Something from your body. It's usually fingernails, but some use their own blood, skin, hair, etc. It becomes a curse if you use someone else's body parts.
- Weapon. Something to stab the doll so that you can anger it. Real knives are dangerous, so most people use pencil or needle.
- Salt/Saltwater or alcohol. Without this, the game won't end. The material is used to get rid of the spirit.
- Safety place. You NEED a safe sanctuary, somewhere preferably with lots of crosses, god statues, etc.
- A name. Giving the spirit a name is the most powerful thing a human can give to the spirit. Names give spirits great power.

Method:
1.Cut the doll and replace the foam/stuffing with rice.
2. Place something from your body into the doll.
3. Wrap the doll with a red thread as if to hinder(stop) the doll.
4. In a bathroom, pour water onto a large washbasin and find a place to hide.
5. Place a cup of salt water in the place before starting the game.

To play:
Start at 3 AM, since that is the time where spirits are the most free to move.
Give the doll a name (for example: Bob).
When the clock strikes 3, close your eyes and say, ""First tagger is (doll name)! First tagger is (doll name)! First tagger is (doll name)!""
When talking to the doll, you MUST talk sternly.
Now go to the bathroom and place the doll in the washbasin.
Turn off all lights.
Close your eyes and count to 10, get your prepared weapon and go to the bathroom.
Go to the doll in the washbasin and say

""I found you (doll name)!""

And stab the doll.
After that, close your eyes again and say

""Now (doll name) is it! Now (doll name) is it! Now (doll name) is it!""

Place the weapon next to the doll and go to your hiding (safety) place. You MUST lock the door.
Also, lock all windows and doors.
Place the salt water in your mouth. DO NOT SPIT IT OUT. The salt water will protect you from the spirit.

To end the game:
When you want to end the game, take leftover salt water or alcohol and find the doll.
The doll may not be in the bathroom. (There are instances of the doll being outside).
When you find the doll, spit out the salt water and spray the leftover.
Close your eyes and shout
""I win! I win! I win!""

The doll will give up.
It is advised to burn the doll after the game.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
-You MUST play this game alone. If more than one person does this at the same time, there's a great chance that someone will be possessed.
- Do NOT go outside the house.
- Keep the game under 2 hours. After this time, the spirit will be too strong to remove.
- When hiding, you MUST be silent.
- Turn off all electronics before starting.
- When running away, do NOT look back. Only look forward. And don't sleep while playing - the doll may stab you.
- When discovered by the doll, you can get a small wound or be possessed. When the doll finds you, your weapon will be around the floor or in your pocket, so you must be careful.
- After the game is over, it is important to clean up properly. Spray salt on every corner of the house, especially places where you put the doll and where you found it. Salt scares away any spirits.

Experiences:
People say that usually the TV flips channels on its own, perfectly normal lights flicker, the TV volume seems to change (if you left TV and other lights on), doors seem to open and shut on their own, or you can hear the sound of laughter. Often when the doll is found, it's away from the its original spot. Sometimes, the demons actually chase after your spot and demand that you come out.""",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_14lrw6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/14lrw6/hide_and_seek_alone_a_popular_korean_ghost_game/,

Things were pretty much normal--she didn't want to settle down, and I was telling her that it was time to lay down and go to sleep, when she grabbed my face and asked, ""Do you love me?""

That's a pretty strange question, but I answered, ""Yes! I love you very, very much!""

Then she squeezed my face harder, and put her face really close to mine, and said, ""DO. YOU. LOVE. ME?""

That was even stranger, and a little off-putting, but I answered, ""Yes, of course I love you.""

Then she covered my mouth with her hands and said, ""That's why you're dead.""

I wasn't sure that's what she said the first time, but she repeated it over and over--maybe five times.

At first glance it didn’t look like much - a simple split level on a residential street in a suburb of Jacksonville, Florida. My employers had renovated the house to be a small office and print shop. We moved from our location in a strip mall to the finished house shortly after I started working there in early 1994. And then the weird stuff started.

It was little things at first – you put your pen down on the counter and turn to do something and the pen is gone. You look EVERYWHERE only for the pen to show up where you know you left it in the first place. The computers went haywire… and we had fairly new Macs which were trouble free in the old location. We started joking about “the ghost”. “The ghost” took your pen. “The ghost” crashed your computer again… It was funny for a while. And then the cleaning crew quit – because they saw a little girl floated outside the upstairs window. 

My boss (and owner) of the company joked around about it at first. And then the employees started sharing their stories. A man in overalls with mutton shop sideburns was seen in the house when the first employees arrived for the day – they unlocked the doors, turned off the security system and searched the building (which wasn’t very big to begin with). No one was to be found. An employee working late by himself heard someone come in the front door and walk down the hall – he expected it to be our boss who worked long and odd hours. But when he called out to her, no one was there. That particular employee worked late pretty often. On a different night he heard the water cooler go glug, glug, glug… like someone had gotten a glass of water from it. I know what you are thinking… sometimes those coolers make the noise on their own. But this one was bone dry – no water in it. He packed up his stuff and left for the night. 

Then the interactions got more intense. One particular worker was pinched and scratched in the back room of the house that we used for our bindery area and storage. My boss – who would come to work at 3 or 4 in the morning had several experiences. One morning she came to work and went down to the back room to get some files. As she was leaving she heard a voice tell her to, “turn out the lights”. So she complied! She also claimed to have had a full on conversation with a little girl apparition. The girl showed up one day outside of the front door. My boss asked her where her parents were and where she lived. She turned around and the girl had disappeared.  

Now up until this point I had heard a lot of stories but hadn’t had anything happen to me. I think part of the reason for that was that I a) did not work after dark and/or alone and b) said out loud to whatever was there that I did not want to see or hear it. But one particular day I was working at my computer and our pressman (a diehard skeptic and volunteer fireman) came up from the garage to grab a soda out of the kitchen. He passed by my desk before pausing and darting upstairs to the accounting offices. He came back down the stairs looking white as a ghost and asked if our boss had passed by my desk. I told him that no one had been by. He then explained to me that he had  seen our boss in her office by the kitchen when he went to get his soda. She was standing there smiling at him. He assumed she was ribbing him for dropping a bunch of rush jobs on him. When he came back into my area, he said he got a horrible feeling of dread – that something was very, very wrong and he needed to go upstairs to check. He had no reason for feeling this way – it was just a gut reaction. When he got upstairs he saw my boss talking to our accountant! She had been up there for half an hour going over the accounts. So who or what was it in the front of the house? I will never forget the fear and shock I saw on his face when he realized that he had seen something that he could not explain. 

That Halloween a local radio station had a contest  - they would broadcast from a haunted location in the area. We entered and told about all of our stories and won! The radio station came out early that morning before I was even awake. By the time I got in my car and started to listen, things had already been happening. Equipment was failing in the back room and they had to use their cell phones to broadcast, voices were heard over the radio that weren’t heard by the people in the house, a ruler had been suspended on a wall and fallen right in front of a coworker! Crazy stuff! As soon as I got to work I ran to find someone who had witnessed the ruler falling. A coworker took me to the infamous back room and showed me where a metal ruler had been suspended high on a wall, right above a doorway. There was no shelf or even molding of any kind around the door. It was just painted cinderblock. As she is explain this to me, over to our left we saw another coworker… he was just standing there staring at us while we talked. Suddenly, here is this same coworker coming in the door on the opposite side of the room! The two of us looked at each other and asked him how he did that! He looked at us like we were nuts and said he had been out back cleaning the mop for a while. There was absolutely NO WAY he could have gone from where we saw him to the back door. 

Later we listened to some of the earlier broadcast on playback. At the time, I had no idea what an EVP (electronic voice phenomena) was. What I heard on that tape scared me – first the sound of children playing and then later, when the DJ was in the back room you can hear a deep, threatening voice that said, “LEAVE ME ALONE.” 

After the broadcast my boss was contacted by several psychic mediums. She let probably half a dozen come to the house. Some of them were quacks but there were three or four of them who actually came up with the same details. One of these psychics stood out, however. She immediately knew that the house had been renovated and described how it used to look – this used to be a closet, that used to be an old kitchen – and she was completely accurate. 

She said there were four main spirits in the house: a young woman in her late 20s to early 30s, an older man with overalls in his 60s, a little girl around 7-9 years old and a young man in his 20s who was extremely angry and stayed mainly in the back room area. As she walked the house she mentioned a couple of areas… a closet where the little girl had been sent when she was being punished. The psychic made it clear that she wasn’t locked in there or abused – but that she could feel the residual energy. She was calm and very matter of fact. That is, until she walked into the back room.

As soon as she entered the room she was visibly shaken. She excused herself and said that she could not stay in the room, that the energy was far too disturbing. She exited through the back door and walked to the center of the yard. She took a minute to compose herself and then apologized. She said as soon as she walked into that room she could see BODY PARTS hanging from the big wooden ceiling beam. Then, she turned and pointed at a wooden workbench near the back door. She asked if there had been a second workbench on the other side of the house. Yes, there had been. Then she said, “That’s where he cut them up.” That is how we found out that not only was our house/office haunted. But it had been the scene of at least one murder. And a mutilation murder at that!

Needless to say, my boss was disturbed. She did some research and what she found was even more troubling. There had indeed been an incident at the house – but no one had been arrested or tried for the murder – because they couldn’t find a TORSO or HEAD. The information she was able to dig up pointed to homeless men being murdered by KKK members… and the sheriff  of the town at that time was deeply involved with the clan – maybe even the grandmaster.  At one point the TV show “Sightings” came and did an investigation but didn’t catch any evidence. They also did exhaustive research into the “incident” but mysteriously all the records had been lost. The county said the state had them, the state said the county had them… The Sightings folks also confirmed our suspicions about the clan and a cover up. No wonder that young man in the back room was so angry. 

I just googled the address and found that the commercial property is available to rent for $2500 a month. I just wouldn’t stay there after dark if I were you.

I believe that there are happenings on this earth that cannot be logically explained.  I've always been a little skeptical, but I didn't completely denounce that ghosts exists.  However, I'm starting to think they are definitely real, and that little kids can see them.



Yesterday, Sunday, I volunteered to watch the little kids of my church while their parents were out volunteering.  Our church meets in the community center, so that's where I was watching the kids -- one baby, and two 2-year-olds - a boy and a girl.  And you are right, our church is not very big.



After the center cleared out, it was just me and one other volunteer.  She had the baby in a side room, trying to put him down for a nap.  I had the two year olds in the main room.  



I had a ""weird feeling"" all day, and kept feeling like there was someone standing behind me, but chalked it up to being alone in the building.  The kids and I were sitting on the floor and rolling a ball back and forth to one another when the boy asked if we could throw it instead.  I said yes and we stood up.  He ran towards me and threw the ball just out of my reach.  It went behind me.  I did not hear it bounce.



The kids looked at each other and started giggling.  I whirled around and saw the ball suspended in midair for a split second before falling to the ground.  The kids just kept laughing.  They started pointing and saying what sounded like ""the man! the man!""



That was all ""paranormal"" that occurred yesterday.  The kids didn't say anything about ""the man"" for the rest of the day.  It freaked me out, but I wasn't scared.

I have been really sick for a few weeks now - terrible migraines, violent vomiting, wooziness, trouble breathing (we thought it was my asthma), insane dreams - and just got back from school last week.  My mother thought it was a really bad, really strong case of the flu.  



A few days ago I was lying on the couch, feeling worse than ever.  I was having a lot of trouble breathing, and I thought I needed to go to the hospital.  I tried to call out to my mom when I felt my eyes roll and I passed out.  Or so I thought.



Suddenly, I felt fine.  My eyes were still closed, but my muscles didn't hurt, and I could breathe with no problem.  I was also standing.  I opened my eyes and saw that I was standing on the opposite side of the living room, looking at the couch.  My mother was bent over the couch, touching a person lying there.  I realized that the person she was standing over was me.  



She touched my shoulder and said, ""ghost_for_awhile, did you need something.""  I didn't respond.  She shook me, and nothing happened.  She started feeling for a pulse and breathing.  Then she started screaming.



My dad, brothers, and sister came running in and all of them were panicking.  I tried to speak to them, but I couldn't.  It felt like I was moving underwater.  My dad started chest compressions while my sister dialed 911.  As soon as my dad pressed on my chest a few times, I felt my (ghost?) self being pulled forward.



Next thing I knew, I was lying back on the couch with my family surrounding me and paramedics bursting in our front door.  I was in the hospital a few days, and I'm home now.  I feel like I never was sick, either.



Obviously, in my sick state, I could have completely imagined this whole thing.  There is a very large possibility that I never died at all, and that my family just panicked.

I hope you do choose to read it.

I am a very skeptical and logical person who does not believe in the paranormals in particular, which is why I do not fancy just making up stories about such. Thus everything I'm about to say here is completely honest. This happened when I was only 2 years old. My father was there when it happened, and he remembers the whole thing. He can recall every bit of this story just like I can. Let me also add that I remember this vividly, dispite me being only 2 when it happened. But somehow I don't remember it as a normal 1st-person memory; I remember seeing it above myself as it happened. Somehow while this occurred it was as if I were floating above myself watching it happen, and the memory plays in my head like a video camera strapped to the ceiling recording the scene.


I was playing with toys on the floor of my living room. My father was sitting on the couch a few feet away, watching TV. Then, sort of like a robot, I just stood up, and then slowly turned around and faced my father. I looked around the room saying, ""Who am I? Where am I?"". I was extremely confused and disorientated.

Then I walked towards my father. I began frantically asking him for help. 

""Who am I?"" I asked my father. 

""...Well, you're WoopAhhh."" my father replied with confusion.

 ""No, I am not! I'm 16 years old. Why am I here? I live in the Welty house. They set the house on fire. They are after my brothers!"" I began talking about horses in the stables and how they were trapped and burning alive. My father just stared at me speechless.

Then, after staring at him for a moment, I simply turned around, walked back to my spot on the floor, and continued playing with my toys.

My parents tried for years to find information about this. Eventually they did find a Welty boarding house in the 1800s which got set on fire.

Let me also stress that I was only 2 years old when I said these things. 2-year-olds are just learning to talk. There was no possible way I could have come up with such a story and spoken it so well at this age. My father said I sounded like I was an adult when I said all of this.

And I think that I might have bought protection from them.,bitelulz,138,40,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1jwy9h/i_think_theres_fairies_or_something_in_my_house/,"Ok, I have to admit, I've never been a believer of paranormal stuff, and I really don't have any knowledge about it. But I thought I would share my experience.

This turned out to be really, super long because apparently, I don't know how to condense. Sorry!

Boring background that is probably not relevant at all, but whatever: 

When I was 5, we moved into a house that was basically half old, half new. One half of our house is over 100 years old, and used to be a farmer's house, I think. It was here before our town was even established. About 30 years ago, when the suburb was being developed, they didn't want to just tear the old half down, since it was in good shape, so they just tore one side off and added on to it, so now we've got the old house, and the rest of the house is just slapped onto the side of it. 

Anyways, the house is old, the land is old, and there's history here. 

I'm the only person with a bedroom in the old half of the house. All the other bedrooms are in the new half. The very first night we were all sleeping in the new house, I woke up in the middle of the night. This was odd, since I've always been a ridiculously heavy sleeper, even when I was little. But I just woke up, and it was like someone had just put knowledge into my head. I knew that there was something I *had* to do, that it was on me. 

I grabbed my Nani (stuffed animal I loved very much, more than anything else in the world) and climbed out of bed. I went downstairs, then into the basement. As I came down the steps of the basement, I saw several small balls of bright blue light that were moving around. There were about 7-10 of them, each about half the size of a soccer ball, and about a foot off the floor. They were floating in the air, but it wasn't a light, easy floating. It felt like people standing at a meeting, maybe shifting around a bit or moving around to get to their spot, but it all felt very purposeful. I felt their attention on me, that they were watching men to see what I would do. They arranged themselves into a rough half-circle, leaving me access to the middle.

I knew that they wanted some kind of sacrifice. Not sacrifice, really. I don't know what word to use. Payment? Token? Offering? Gift? It was like, they expected me to give them something simply because of what they were, because of their importance. It was like the same way a king expects a emissary to bring a gift. They wanted something valuable and important to me. So I gave Nani one last hug and kiss, and carefully set her down in the middle of the half-circle, which was about the middle of the room. As soon as I did that, it felt settled, like a contract had been signed. So I went up to my room and went to sleep. The next morning, before my parents woke up, I went downstairs to see what had happened, and Nani was gone. 

I have to explain something really quick. Throughout the experience, I didn't feel scared, or happy, or sad, or anything but sort of matter-of-fact. It was just like ""ok, this is what's happening, this is what I have to do"". It felt very business-like.

I think I bought protection or something for our house. In the time we've lived here, there were times where, due to weather, we definitely should have had flooding, or power problems, or water problems, or something. But we've always been fine! This is especially odd because according to the guy who inspected our house a couple years ago (my parents were thinking about selling), the builder for the new side did a shitty job with sub-par materials, and by all rights that side should be basically falling apart. But it's totally fine! 

Additionally, we've never had serious illness or injury in the house or on the property (despite 4 klutzes living here), no mishaps with fire or nails or such, nothing falling over and breaking, and no animal attacks or bites (despite several meeeeeean dogs of guests). 

I don't know if I'm just crazy and we're lucky, I don't know if maybe it was all just a weird kid's dream, I don't know if this is just ridiculous. But that's what I experienced, and that's all I know. It felt very real to me.

I would love to get any theories or information about the blue lights, I would really appreciate it.  I will try to answer any questions you have.

Thank you!

P.S. Again, I'm so sorry about the length!

1361307847.0,102,self.Paranormal,18u9k9,I got more than I bargained for at the Thrift Store. Finally sharing my experience with the Paranormal,the_clown_prince,133,31,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18u9k9/i_got_more_than_i_bargained_for_at_the_thrift/,"

Everything you are about to read is 100% true. The things I'm about to talk about took place between 3 and 4 years ago.
 
Some background on myself, I love to thrift store shop. I always have. I would go with my sister while she was pregnant a lot toward the end of her pregnancy to get her walking because her baby was late. I always used to buy the craziest clothes that I could just because I liked them. During this phase, I was shopping one day and I saw an old fedora that I didn't really like, but I just felt drawn to. It was $7 and I really didn't want to buy it, but I felt like I had to, so I did. I didn't mention this feeling to anyone because I didn't think anything of it. 

By this time she had a baby girl, and we all live in my parents' house. She, her husband, and their baby have the back room, I have the middle room, and my parents are in the front.
Anyway, back to this hat. I got really attached to it. I wore it literally all the time. I only took it off when I went to sleep, and I'd put it back on when I woke up.

 After a few weeks I started feeling like I was being watched in my room. It was a feeling I never had in my own home before. Whenever I was in my room I felt like there was someone behind me watching.
 My bed faced my door. I always slept with the door closed because my dogs sleep in my room with me. Not long after the feeling of being watched I finally saw it.

 I woke up in the middle of the night and I felt it really strong so I sat up and looked around my room. Obviously it was pitch black, but over by my door there was something standing there. It was darker than dark. I realize how cliché that sounds, but I have no idea how else to describe it. It was the shape of a man. I knew he was a man, but I never saw any details on him.

 I honestly don't know how long this went on. All I know is that night after night he was there, standing in the corner watching me. I knew he was watching me, and I would sleep facing the wall with my back to him. I would sleep under the blanket as an old habit from childhood because I've always been afraid of the dark.

 I didn't want to say anything to anyone because I watch a lot of paranormal shows because the topic intrigues me. My dad thinks it's all crap and thinks I'm scared of my own shadow. If I told him, he'd tell me stop watching the shows. My mom is a Jesus freak, and if I told her she'd start praying and burning sage. My sister was the only person that I felt that I could confide in, but I didn't want to because I didn't know what she'd think. Finally she came into my room one day and asked if she could talk to me about something. (last time this happened she was pregnant.) Naturally, I said yes, and sat down to talk. 

She told me she didn't want me to think she was crazy, but she had been seeing a black shadow man in her room at night. She said that she didn't know what to do, she would tell him to go away, and he would. She finally came to me, because she saw him bending over her daughter's crib. 

Yes, I know that babies naturally wake up during the night because they're hungry, but anyone who has ever lived with a baby, you can attest to this: a baby's hunger cry, and a baby's scared cry are two very distinct sounds. Apparently this had happened repeatedly lately.

 I was freaked.

 I told her I had been seeing him every night for weeks. He watches me while I sleep. She said we had to do something about it, because this man is terrifying her daughter. She left my room, and I just sat there with my head swimming. 

She went out food shopping and I was home alone for a bit. Looking back on it, I see how incredibly stupid it was, but I grabbed an old pellet gun that I had used for cosplays and I pointed it into my hallway that connected our rooms. I screamed at him (sidenote I called him Lamont because of The Shadow) I screamed ""What are you doing Lamont? Scaring a baby girl? What are you, some kind of COWARD!? Does that make you feel good scaring a woman, and a baby? Does that make you feel like a big man? You leave her alone! Don't ever go near my niece or my sister again! You want to pick on somebody? PICK ON SOMEONE YOUR OWN SIZE!"" I was almost in tears by the time I had finished screaming. 

I went back into my room and got changed. Went on with the rest of my evening, and got into bed that night. I woke up that night at 3:03am. I knew it was then because I looked at the clock, and every detail of that night is burned into my memory.

 I woke up and looked over to where he stood, and there he was, but tonight was different. It wasn't the same feeling I could FEEL how angry he was. He wasn't just watching at me, he was glaring at me, and I knew it.

 I was terrified, and I turned to lay back down and I saw him glide from over by the door to right next to me. I threw my blanket over my head and felt his glare on the back of my head. 

My blanket got thrown against the wall next to my bed and when I tried to grab it, it wouldn't budge. After that I was pinned to my bed. I couldn't move, and I couldn't yell for help. The most I could do was close me eyes and mentally say the prayer of Saint Michael. 

This went on until 4:01am. It was less than an hour, but it felt like an eternity. 

The next day I went and bought a St. Michael statue and put medals around my room. I was terrified to sleep in there. I told my sister the jist of what happened (this is the first time I've ever shared full details), and she told my parents without me knowing. 

It turns out, my mother had seen him in the hallway. My dad had come down the stairs early in the morning and saw someone sitting in the recliner repeatedly. 

If I haven't lost you by now, I'm sure you're wondering what the hell the hat I talked about in the beginning had anything to do with this. Well, the day after my ordeal, was the first day since I bought it that I didn't wear it. When I didn't wear it I felt like a different person, I felt like a weight had been lifted from me. Like I was chained, and now I was free. It was an odd feeling.

 I never wore the hat again. The man didn't go away immediately though.

 You see, I didn't put this stuff together with the hat until after everything occurred.

 A few weeks after the attack, my sister and I still saw him at night, but not every night. I was working on a halloween costume, and since I didn't wear the hat anymore I cut it up to use it on a costume. I didn't like how it turned out, so I threw it out.

 After the hat was destroyed and gone, we never saw him again. It wasn't until about a year later that my sister and I were talking about it and she mentioned this stuff about the hat. Once I put it together, it has made me very cautionary toward the things I buy.
 
Now, you can believe what you want about the paranormal, and the supernatural, but I have experienced everything you have just read.

 I'm not religious, and I'm not spiritual or anything, but there has not been a day that has gone by since that night when I haven't had a St. Michael the Archangel medal on my person, and I haven't experienced anything like this since. 

I've always wanted to share this experience, but never knew how.

I know there's a subreddit called r/nosleep, but this isn't a scary story I'm trying to share or some horrible freaky experience.
But here's the thing, and I'm not trying to be scary or sound like a damn psycho, I'm actually a bit..freaked out/concerned. It might sound ridiculous, but ever since he was born I felt there was always something in his room. Toys that were off would turn on and play, he would stare blankly at one spot in the room, things like that. Call me crazy.
He is 2, going on 3 in January, this is why I can't really imagine it's an imaginary friend. He doesn't know what that would be, I don't think. I imagine that's more of something for 4+ kinda age.
So, apparently her name is ""Susan"" and she has short black hair and wears a dress. We don't know anyone named Susan, or anyone who has that kind of appearance. Not sure where he'd get the idea of her.
He was telling me and his father where she was sitting outside, where she was inside, what she was doing, etc. etc.
I told my sister about it, she's pretty christian, and she told me to go pray and tell it to leave. However, I'm not religious, and I feel ridiculous doing that. Also, it makes me feel like I'd be giving in to believing something is really there.
Sigh Anyone got some feedback for me? I feel uncomfortable with this whole deal.

**Edit:** Last night 9/8/12 he was woken up 3 different times. This is very unusual because he sleeps through the night, once in a while he might wake up for a drink, but that's rare. But these 3 times he woke up crying, and when I would get to his doorway, he was sitting upright in his bed, quiet, staring at nothing. I'd look around to see what had his interest, nothing. Then I'd say his name and all of a sudden he jumps and starts crying again, like I just scared the crap out of him. Our floors creek, so he can always hear when I'm coming into his room, so it was weird that he totally zoned that out. *sigh*

So of course, this had me up all night just staring down the hallway in to his room (ours doorways are right down the hall from the other) as if I was expecting someone to walk across the doorway in his room. I never did see anything, but eventually he came and slept in our bed.

Thank you all so much for the condolences. I truly and greatly appreciate them. I hope for the few that obviously do not understand what it feels like to lose someone, that you won't have to experience it. And if or when you do, that you are able to find support in those dark times. 

I've heard from the guy who does night shift that he also heard the same noise I did late the other night. He told me that he used to stand outside with the deceased and smoke a cigarette, where he'd do that same ""bug"" noise beside his ear. He heard it outside where they'd stand together. 

His service is next weekend so it will be good closure for everyone, I think. 

Again, thank you so much, guys.

**/EDIT**

This past Monday night my coworker committed suicide. 

I came the morning after and lit a candle for him. He was the first amidst the office to not only help me get my bearings for the job but welcome me as a friend. We went to breakfast and would just mess around during our shifts. It was almost like I was a kid-sister... or something. 

One of the things he'd do to ""bug"" me was rub his index finger and his thumb together to make a vibrating noise that would sound like a bee. He'd do it right next to my ear so that'd tickle and I'd jump back. 

I decided to check out the new break room that was built for us today. I lounged on the new couch for a minute next to the lamp we were going to have memorialized for him (with a plaque). As I was walking through the hall to leave the break room to get back to work, bzzzzzzz. 

My ear tickled and I stopped. 

I walked back through the hall to see if maybe some new thing in the wall was making noise or something (since the room was just built). But I couldn't find the sound again. Beside that, the feeling was RIGHT next to my ear. Like he used to do... 

I'm not sure if it was him or not. But if it is, I hope it means he's in a good place...

It had just recently been completely renovated, everything was practically new, which was great. 

A few weeks into living there I began to get very strange vibes from the place. I began feeling like somebody was in the room with me, hearing strange things, and one night I even saw a giant shadow swoop across my living room. Sometimes I would walk into a room and expect to see somebody in there with me because of the overwhelming feeling of somebody being there. I'm used to things of paranormal nature and in this case, I actually wasn't too scared about it. It was a very non-threatening feeling.

3 weeks in I went out and I purchased a dog. He was just a puppy but the whole time he grew up he would increasingly wake up for no reason, chase something in the kitchen/hallway and bark at absolutely nothing, along with the hair on his neck and back standing up in mohawk form.

About a month in a had a very strange dream. I was in the living room of my apartment and I saw a lady in there that drifted across the living room. In the dream I said, ""hey! That's the lady that used to live here!"" After that, things started happening all the time. Water faucets turning on, bathroom fans turning on, doors being unlocked and locked, and even seeing shadows underneath doorways. Again, I was never scared but still didn't know what was going on. There began to be a distinct smell that only occupied the second bathroom. An almost ""elderly"" odor if that makes sense. An odor that was not apparent in any other room of the house.

Well, a couple months in I was talking to my neighbor across the hall and I had mentioned some stuff. She looked at me with a blank stare as I asked, ""did somebody happen to die in my apartment?"" She then proceeded to say, ""who told you that?!?"" Well... turns out, an elderly lady had passed away in my living room of cancer just a month or so before I moved in. She was a dog lover, a great person, and from what my neighbor (who has her urn and dog) says, a bit of a prankster! I described the features of the lady I saw in my dream to my neighbor and she almost lost it. I was spot on when I told her what she looked like.

I moved out about 2 weeks ago and said my goodbyes to the lady that used to live there. I told my friends about it, but they didn't seem to care.

It was getting dark, so we decided to turn on an overhead light in the kitchen behind us. A little while later the loading screen came on and on the pitch black screen, illuminated by the kitchen light, we could see two small handprints that were at odd angles and ended in downward smeared strokes. This was extremely alarming because his 2 year old had been with her mother for the past few days and the handprints hadn't been there until that night. They also looked a bit too small to be her hands; she is quite large for her age and these were smaller hands, with very thin fingers. The TV is also too high for her to reach and there's no way for her to get up to it to place her hands on it. We were both pretty spooked but decided to leave them there and try to pay it no mind so as not to invite anything. We've both always semi-felt something wasn't quite right in the house, but it's never seemed malicious or even very tangible (if that makes much sense) so we've just gone about our lives as usual.

Anyway, on Friday (May 31) we picked her up for the week and she came back to the house with us. We were later changing her diaper and out of nowhere she points to the ceiling and says ""handprint"". Neither of us has ever heard her say this word before. She's still learning how to talk properly; a lot of words come out garbled and she doesn't speak in entirely complete sentences yet. Despite this, that word was clear as day. We looked at her and asked her calmly if she could explain what ""handprint"" meant. She looked back at us and said a lot of syllables really quickly and seriously, but neither of us could understand a word of it. After that she went back to looking at the ceiling but began pointing and laughing. Once we had finished changing her, she stood up and made her hands into claws and said ""monster! Rooooar!"" Needless to say this scared us both a lot and we tried to get her to explain herself further, but she just ran off and wanted to play. Nothing much happened until today except hearing her mutter ""handprint"" again a couple times while we asked her about it.

Early this morning, around 4AM, she woke up and started crying because she didn't want to go back to bed. My boyfriend gently guided her back into her room and explained ""bed time"" to her as he does every time this happens and told her goodnight and left the room to see what she did. She continued crying for a couple of minutes, and then suddenly she stopped and we could hear her explaining to her room the reason why she was crying: she got out of bed and Dad made her go back to bed but she wanted to play. Oddly enough, she didn't cry much after this anymore, and we stayed up for nearly an hour just to keep checking on her. She went back to sleep fairly quickly.

Just an hour or so ago, she was sitting in her highchair eating and all of a sudden she pointed high on the wall and screamed ""look!""

 [First post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/rx8df/i_can_communicate_with_the_dead/)


Since then, I recently posted about my last encounter, being it was so odd.
And after an over flowing inbox of questions, I have decided to do another Q&amp;A.

____________________________________________________________________________________________
  Ever since I can remember, I have always seen ""Grey People"" ""Shadow People"" or ""The Dead"".

For years my parents thought it was just imaginary friends, but once I was old enough to actually explain to my parents what/who I was seeing they realized I was seeing people, dead people. (After i told them about my nana, who I never met b/c she passed 7 years before I was born.) Other than my parents no one else really knows that I can see the dead and communicate with them. But...

  I see people everywhere, especially in the hospital I work at. I can feel their presence before I see them. I can hear them when I sleep. Sometimes they come to me for help other times they just look at me and continue to mettle about.

In my last apartment, I held long conversations with a guy who passed while swimming with friends in a lake. His girlfriend lived next door, and he didnt want to leave her by herself. He was very nice and even helped me find my keys.

  I was little I told my mother that I died near a bridge we drove over. I think I was 6 or 7-ish. But I remember telling her about me being shot in the chest and leg, laying near a creek and dying. I described a very detailed vision of a battle field from the Civil War era? I was never allowed to watch Television that much when I was younger, and if I did it was always with my parents.

  I had never seen or read anything about that area, nor had I been there before. But my mom said it was creepy listening to me describe the things I was seeing, and that I was a man in this ""story"" as she called it. I asked her many years later where we were when I told her this. After looking it up, it turns out the land was an old battlefield from the Civil War.

  In addition, I want to add that sometimes I dream about places before I visit them. Houses/buildings mostly. I will dream about place, and then about a week or two later I will be driving or on a trip in an area Ive never been and bam, I see the place I had dreamed about.

  Its never anything significant, but I thought I would share that as well.
I just wanted to get this off my chest and see what some of you thought. I know some will dismiss this as a crazy persons rambles or a troll.

I would have been 14-15ish. We'd hiked in through the bush, and hadn't seen anyone else since we were dropped off that morning. It was late at night, in the middle of winter. I was the only one still awake, it was a full moon, and moonlight was streaming in through the window, casting a big light patch on the wall opposite me. I remember it clearly, right down to the shadow of the cross between the window panes.

Now... imagine, if you will, someone walking up behind you as you face towards a wall, with the headlights of a car behind. I'm sure you can imagine the way you would see their shadow, clearly humanoid, looming up alongside your own. 

Well, lying there, on the floor of this old hut, only person awake, I saw that shadow. In the rectangle of moonlight opposite me, I saw a shadow like that of a person walking towards the hut grow up the wall over about 20 seconds. It even swayed slightly from side to side as a person's shadow would with each footstep. When the shadow was filling about 3/4s of the moonlit space on the wall, it suddenly shot to the side, as if a person had suddenly dived away to avoid being seen. 

I got up, and looked out the door, and there was no one there. I woke up my best mate, and told him I thought someone was outside. We went all around the hut, and there was no one out there. We called out into the night, and there was no response. We were about 20kms from the nearest highway, on a remote bush track, so its not like there were many casual passers by. There were certainly no vehicles nearby that we could hear the sound of, and like I said, we hadn't seen anyone since that morning when we were dropped off. 

Pretty much the most unnerving thing I have ever seen. I've never seen anything like it since, and to this day, I can't think of a rational explaination for it.

When I was about 7 my parents had an extension put into the attic of our house, which became my bedroom. I remember feeling incredibly excited when the room was being build (mainly because it's a frickin' huge room!) but also because I didn't have to share with my older brother any more.

However, when I actually moved up there I felt very scared of the room. I still think that the main reason was because I was at the top of the house and no longer in the same room as my brother and next to my parents' room, but I had a lot of sleepless nights with the light on feeling very scared and very alone. I didn't feel alone in the family. In fact, when I told my parents about this my Mum started coming upstairs to read with me and my Dad would play songs on the guitar until I fell asleep. They would then turn off the light and I would generally not wake up until the morning.

But then one night, I woke up. I remember waking up suddenly, as if I had not been sleeping at all, like I had just opened my eyes after holding them shut for a while. I remember an intense feeling of what I can only describe now as dread all over me. The room had never looked darker and I was terrified. Then I saw him. I looked across the room and saw a little boy, around the same age as I was, pale faced, vacant expression, standing by the bookcase. He was dressed in Victorian clothing (my house is a Victorian house) and was looking at my books. Lying at his feet was a huge black dog with long, straggly hair. As you can imagine I was paralysed with fear, too scared to scream for my Dad. Suddenly, the boy looked right at me. I can't remember much about his face other than he was very pale. Immediately, I pulled the covers over my head and started to scream for my parents. It took a while for them to wake up and run upstairs and the whole time I was waiting I could feel the boy standing right next to my bed. I can't explain it but I just knew he was there. Both my parents came into the room and immediately the feeling was gone. They both put it down to a bad dream and let me sleep in their bed.

Now, I'm undecided about ghosts and don't do much reading at all about it, partly because the idea of it terrifies me. Some people find it very comforting, but for me when something is gone it should stay gone. But anyway, for many years I just thought I had just imagined it (I had an incredibly over active imagination, like most children do) but in the past year I have noticed some patterns. (I just realised that this is going to be quite long, sorry! Please bare with me, I could really use some advice on this).

Okay so firstly, my sleeping habits. When I was a child I would suffer (and I mean suffer) from night terrors. For those that don't know, a night terror is like a nightmare but you wake up in a dream like state and the nightmare basically enters your reality. They're horrible and luckily I've grown out of them. But yeah, I would get them a lot and go running around the house screaming in fear until my parents calmed me down. I wont go into details but basically, about a year ago I asked my Mum when these started. She said at around 7 years old. I asked for her to be more specific and she said when I moved into the attic, which could be explained as simply a young boy being freaked out by changing rooms but maybe not.
Anyway, that got me thinking about how well I slept in this room. I stayed in the room until I was around 18 and I went off to university. The whole time in there I never remember sleeping well alone in there, and always felt scared. Maybe because it's a huge room with lots of spooky places to hide or maybe because of this memory that still terrifies me today. I still always sleep better when there's someone else in the room with me, and especially when I slept in that room I would have friends and girls stay over as much as possible. In fact, still today I always have a good proper look around the room before turning out the light and my girlfriend has got to understand that, some nights, if it doesn't feel right the light stays on all night.

I also thought about this room and the effect it had on my lifestyle. When I was about 14 I started smoking weed (and still do), and was fine with it. But a few years after, when I was about 16 I started using more dangerous drugs. I felt very alone and very depressed and, to be honest, scared of everything. I would sometimes get panic attacks that I would have to ride out in my room on my own because I didn't want my parents to know I was taking drugs. I would talk to myself and cut my arms, with no real understanding of why. I moved out of the room when I was nearly 19 and I stopped taking the more dangerous drugs, felt a lot better about myself and generally turned my life around. Now, my little brother who's around about 2 years younger moved into that room. He had developed a strong reliance on skunk, starting when he was about 15, and was already suffering with depression. However, when he moved up to that room he started having panic attacks, morbid thoughts and, most significantly, night terrors. As a family we all pulled together and helped him through his issues and he's much better now, moved out and is now at university himself, but this is a strange coincidence I think. Obviously it can be put down to our drug use, family issues, history of poor mental health in the family, isolation in the house and just general teenage angst. But the pattern seems interesting to me.

When I was in the room, going through what I was going through, I trashed a lot of the furniture, wrote on the walls and just did general disrespectful teenage stuff. However, I realised a while ago when I was in the room what I did to the bookshelf. Now, this is pretty horrible and I'm actually crying whilst writing about it. I had a very large hunting knife from when I was in the scouts. I had, over time, hacked away at the bookshelves with this knife. However, I only ever hacked at one shelf and recently I realised that this was the same shelf that the boy was standing by. When my brother was packing for university we were emptying the bookshelf and I saw, painted on the backboard of the shelf that I hacked at in my writing, ""No one will ever love you"". It scared the hell out of me when I saw it.

The other day my parents moved up to the room because of decorating work in their room. After a night in there my Mum felt very uncomfortable, scared, cold and claustrophobic. Interesting considering the mattress is memory foam, her husband was with her, the room is well insulated and is the biggest room in the house! I understood immediately when my Mum told me and I said for her to use my room (now downstairs, thank God!)

I'm 21 years old and haven't slept in the room alone since I first moved out. I don't know if anyone had any ideas on this but I thought I'd share. I'm not at all a die hard believer but it interests me and wondered what you guys thought. Personally, I'm thinking that this could be explained as psychological phenomena but you guys might have other ideas. Please be considerate in your responses as even though it's really stupid this is a pretty sensitive subject for me. Writing it all down in one place has made this seem a lot bigger to me than I thought it was.

It has always struck me when watching shows or documentaries on paranormal subjects that if we ever hope to gain respect for investigations into these fields that we should try and be more consistent in our discoveries and investigations.

Things that have already been debunked or at the very least given very plausible explanations are still investigated as if they are new phenomena. This is counterproductive and makes paranormal investigators look silly, thereby devaluing the very real experiences and evidence that has been gathered on other topics. Imagine how far physics would have gotten if there wasn't a concerted effort among the physics community to accept certain theories and throw away others when given good evidence. How much would our knowledge have grown if for every major discovery there were thousands of others claiming they had made discoveries into why apples fall from trees (especially when the apple phenomenon is the one being presented and investigated in the media). The only show that I've seen which does a good job trying to debunk these low hanging paranormal fruit is Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files, which often shows how very well received and believed pieces of evidence/phenomenon are either misidentified camera mistakes or have very simple explanations. 

I propose that we create a sidebar that lists some of these common paranormal events/pieces of evidence and links to articles or video showing that they are not paranormal in nature, or at the very least provides evidence showing that they may have natural explanations. 
My list would include:
-The crystal skulls (of which none have been dated to ancient times, and many of which show evidence of modern creation. Also, there is no mention of them in any historical texts from the surrounding area)
-Spirit orbs (dust in a cameras flash for the most part)
-The surgeons photo of Nessie (a known hoax)
-The idea that humans couldn't possibly have created Stonehenge or the Moa of Easter island (shown to be possible using simple physics principles)
-The paranormal phenomenon attributed to the Oregon Vortex house (shown to be an optical illusion caused by the slope of the house/grounds and the dense forest around the home)
-The starchild skull (the skull of a child who died most likely of a genetic defect)
-Any UFO or cryptid photo or video that is a known or suspected hoax
-Anything that purports to know how Sasquatch lives in the wild/where it lives/what it eats that doesn't use inference from good primate biology. Jeff Meldrum is a great cryptozoologist because he doesn't simply assume that every forested area is ""squatchy"" but looks for real biological reasons for why a Bigfoot may live in an area and backs it up!
-Any paranormal ability that can be replicated by an experienced hypnotist or magician, such as those replicated by Derren Brown. This would include cold reading tricks to talk to the dead, drawing a picture of what another person is thinking, seance magic, etc.
-I would also include a lot of links to more skeptical content, including links showing how a lot of EVP phenomena might be the brain creating patterns in unrecognizable sound due to the power of suggestion, how some hauntings may be due to infrasound reverberating though pipes in old homes, how to tell a good bigfoot track from a bad track using anatomical information and inference, stuff like that. 

This isn't to say that we couldn't still post about these topics, or debate whether or not they should be on the list of possible fakes or explained phenomenon, but I think that having a little bit more information out there would help to cut a lot of the speculation and misinformation in this field and let good investigation and evidence come to the forefront. Just to clarify (and so I don't sound like I don't believe in anything that would warrant me posting to r/paranormal haha) I do think there is good evidence that Bigfoot exists (and for that matter that a number of cryptids actually exist in the wild), that alien life may be visiting the planet Earth, that Atlantis may have existed (and other unknown civilizations), and other sorts of things. I just think we should try and do more to get away from things that have already been explained or debunked, and try and find more hard paranormal evidence and cases of things that have not already been debunked. What would you all put on a list of this sort?

tl;dr I think we should post a list of debunked paranormal phenomena and known/suspected hoaxes, as well as links to articles describing why these are on the sidebar, in order to try and bring more serious paranormal evidence and study to the forefront.

1355457581.0,86,self.Paranormal,14tqb9,I live in a house that is over 100 years old..,Azumikkel,102,16,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/14tqb9/i_live_in_a_house_that_is_over_100_years_old/,"..and I have been doing so for the whole 17 years I've lived. During my time here, I've experienced several odd occurences, but what triggered my decision to make this post was something recent that was pretty extreme compared to the other things that have happened.

I would like to start out by showing you two pictures.

[This is the hallway outside my room.](http://i.imgur.com/ot47q.jpg)

[This is my room seen from my bed.](http://i.imgur.com/nwUDQ.jpg)

Why do I show you these pictures? I'll get to it. Before telling you why, I will tell you what goes on in the whole house of paranormal nature. Some of these might be explained by something non-paranormal, but I will let you judge.

We have several housecats living in the house. It hasn't happened much recently, but a couple years back they showed some odd behavior once in a while. One of the cats would suddenly hiss and stare at nothing. Naturally, one would assume that they were looking at the closest thing in the direction of their gaze, but there would be nothing other than an empty wall, a piece of furniture, sometimes the ceiling. The cat would act threatened, raise the hairs on its back, hiss and growl. Then it would run into the kitchen or entrance room to hide. If there were other cats around, they would look at the same thing as the first cat and growl.

Since this is a pretty old house, there's obviously going to be a ton of creaking (and there is). There is however something odd I've noticed. Very often, this really loud *crack* will sound. It never happened during the day or while there are lights on. It always happens when everyone in the house is in their beds and I'm trying to sleep.

Once in a while, without anything provoking it or anything having touched it, an item such as a broom or a mattress lined against the wall might fall over, or a light object such as a piece of paper might soar off a table. I only consider these occurrences odd when there is no wind to push it, nobody is near the item, and nobody has touched it for hours or even days.

We have a lamp in our front yard that has a sensor making it turn on for a little while whenever something moves. You have to make some pretty heavy movements before it turns on. The light turns on way too often when everyone's in their beds. 

If I have my room's window open at night, I can very often hear footsteps outside. I live at a place surrounded by cornfields. Cats don't make footsteps. My dog is locked inside at night. The area outside my window is fenced off.

This isn't something paranormal and I'm sure it happens in a lot of houses, but it adds to the atmosphere of the house. If a window is open in each end of the house, the draft wind will cause a continuous sound that sounds like tormented screams of hell's inhabitants.

Now, the reason I showed you how my hallway looks is for you to get an idea of how sinister it looks. The light is way darker than on the image, and the door at the end is usually open, letting you look at the big window behind it which reflects a little blur of the lights in the hallway. The view on the image is what you see every time you walk up the stairs. The hallway makes you feel very unpleasant, whether it's day or night. You get the feeling someone is watching you.

Now, the actual thing about this hallway is that we hear footsteps on it when everybody claims to have been in their beds. Once a year on the same night at around 3 am, you can hear the floor creak as if something heavy like a person is walking across. The light on the hallway doesn't get turned on, and I never dared to go out there and check. It could be someone sleepwalking, but while you hear the footsteps go across the hall, you never hear the 'person' walk down the stairs, enter a room (my room is the only room near the stairs), or walk back into the room at the end of the hall. 

As for the picture of my room, it is both for showing you how it looks, and that there is nothing standing in front of my closet - I'll get to that. I didn't always reside in this room. Previously I slept in a room that you can't see on the picture of the hallway; the door is on the right, outside the field of view. Before I resided here, my brother did. Both he and his girlfriend has mentioned getting nightmares in here, feeling someone watching them, and even hearing voices. After I moved in, I have experienced those things as well, except for the latter. My brother thinks it's our great-grandmother who's in the room. Personally I think it's one of the previous owners of the house. I don't know any history about the place sadly.

If you look to the right of my monitors, you'll see my window. Once in a while, whether it's windy or not, the window blows off its hatches and opens. I haven't really spared this a thought until I realized it only happens when I'm sitting in my chair next to it. Never once has it ever opened itself while I was anywhere else in the room, or not in the room at all; I never returned to my room to discover the window having opened or the hatches being off.

Now to the most peculiar part. A couple nights ago I had been trying to sleep for hours. Out of impatience and for being warm, I swing my feet onto the cold floor. I sit like that for a while, then get them back on the bed above the covers and roll to my side, facing the wall. I felt something was wrong and got the urge to turn around, so I rolled onto my other side. I saw something transparently white standing in front of my closet. The room was so dark, whatever it was, it was extremely hard to see. I'm still not sure what it resembled. It looked like something much lighter than fog, shaping what I think was a woman wearing a white dress, slowly swinging it from side to side. I was scared at first, but figured that if she wanted to do me harm, she would have done so already. I tried looking around the room in case it was just some smudge on my eye, but the white stayed at its place in the room. I just sat there staring at it until it slowly faded out.

I considered whether I was sleeping, but I'm a lucid dreamer. I can feel when I'm dreaming; I'll feel groggy, some things don't make logical sense, I only see the details I expect to see, I have a strong urge to close my eyes, I see things from the inside of my head and not through my eyes, and I only feel temperature on my hands and face. When this happened I was as fresh as DeAndre Cortez Way, nothing weird happened other than the white fog and I was getting chills.

When I eventually fell asleep after that, I had one of my worst nightmares in years.

I'm not sure why I took the time to write this or what the point was, as there will probably be two-three people reading this and they'll all forget it as soon as they skip to the next post. I suppose I wanted to share my experience and put it all into words. Well you have my story now.

Here they are, but I'd also like to hear yours! [X-post from /r/AskReddit]",fap_then_nap,109,21,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/118die/my_family_has_a_crazy_history_of_paranormal_and/,"Okay, so for my family's sightings and experiences (I don't have all night to type so I'll keep them brief, would love to elaborate if anyone wants later):

1. Uncle's best friend died of cancer. Right before he passed, they agreed that his friend will come visit him in spirit. A few days later, while showering, my uncle could sense his friend was there (in the SHOWER, of all places). Waiting for something to happen, he suddenly heard his friend yell a joke that was only between them right in front of his face, in the shower. Yea, it freaked my uncle out, but he knew his friend was alright. This gave me the chills when he told me about it, btw.

2. Parents have seen a UFO. Not necessarily aliens, but something unidentified for sure. They were in a suburb in Arizona at nighttime, just getting out of the car to go inside. A massive black shape with ""no definitive outline except for rows of changing, pulsating lights"" was floating past their apartment, humming and staying at exact elevation as it passed. Apparently it was too soft to be turbine-powered and too loud to be a cloud (lol'd at this, but how else would you describe it?). Bottom line, it wasn't a weather balloon and it certainly wasn't a plane that existed 20 years ago. The way my parents described it was that it just didn't seem possible when it moved. I've always been fascinated with that story as a kid and adult.

3. Hours after my grandmother died, my mom and her sisters were sitting in my grandma's favorite room. The door suddenly smashed open and a few seconds later various picture frames, all of my grandmother, fell from their positions sequentially, like someone was STUMBLING AROUND THE ROOM. To this day my family believes it was my grandmother getting used to her spiritual form while revisiting her home.

4. Before my aforementioned grandmother died of a brain tumor that plagued her for months, my mom was going through old stuff in my deceased great-grandmother's attic. An old digital alarm clock was plugged in near where she was sorting. All of sudden, according to my mom, the room got cold and as she was looking around, she noticed that the clock had started flashing. The time had frozen on 8:12. Though my mom says she didn't hear anything, she felt that my great-grandmother was telling her that that date meant something. later that month, on the 12th, my mom's mom died. The month was August. 8/12. Fuck me.

5. My mother would tell this one better than me, but I'll give it a shot. When she was in the hospital waiting for results from her sister's brain surgery, she was approached by a man who I think named himself Larry. Before I continue, let me say that my grandparents were extremely religious; my parents no so much. Anyway, Larry approached my mother and started talking about life, God and feelings. Because of his emotional aura (in other words, the presence about him), my mom wasn't intimidated by Larry, which she didn't understand till his departure. When Larry was done discussing with mom about her dying mother and recovering sister (we are unsure how he knew about them), he got up to leave my mom's side and was GONE. My mother blinked, and Larry the angel was gone. Now, he never referred to himself as an angel. That's my mother's term for him, but hey, it fits. Especially after this: A few weeks later, sitting in her car and thinking about her dying mother, my mom heard Larry's voice, loud and clear: ""BOY, NICE WEATHER TODAY, HUH?"" from her BACK SEAT OF THE CAR. Wiping the tears away, my mother turned around and saw nobody sitting there. She knew, though. Larry had visited. While we have never gone to church as a family, and we believe in all sorts of things (including the possibility of a God), my mother refers to Larry as her personal angel.

6. By now you've probably gathered that my mom has had some WEIRD shit thrown her way. Well, there's more. My mom was very attached to her high school sweetheart and his family. After meeting my dad, she still kept in good contact with her ex's family. One day before I was born, my dad and her were in their new house. My mom was napping on the couch while my dad was cooking. All of a sudden my mother sat up, looked at dad with shock in here eyes, and said ""Tim... Jeff's father just died."" They got the call later that night.

7. Holy balls, I'm making us out to look like paranormal freaks. I like sharing this stuff though, it's just too cool to tell only my friends. Ready for another? When my (different) uncle's beautiful wife passed away due to a serious hospital error during childbirth (he was later awarded millions in a lawsuit), the family was in a wreck and he was suddenly a lone father. Her name was Linda. On the night of Linda's death, my mom woke up (she was NOT dreaming; she WOKE UP) to see Linda as a glowing, peaceful apparition staring at her from the end of the bed. (This shit freaks me out, man). According to my mom, Linda's eyes communicated to my mother that everything was OK and that the family didn't need to worry; just take care of her daughter and husband (sounds cliche, but that's what happened). She then disappeared, and the next morning my uncle said she visited him too. Wow.

8. When my parents were moving around the countryside in the Midwest trying to find a nice spot to raise me, they stayed in this old farmhouse lent to them by a friend for very cheap. It wasn't owned by anyone because the last owner had recently blown his brains out in the basement with a shotgun, for whatever reason. The blood stains were still on the wall, said my parents. Anyway, they both stayed on the ground floor, sleeping on the hard wood with only sleeping bags. I was in a cradle in the corner next to them. There happened to be an air vent next to my parents' heads as they lay there in the awful summer storm, trying to sleep. After a bolt of lightning that shook the house, a scruff voice emanated from the vent: ""THIS IS ONE HELL OF A STORM WE'RE HAVIN!"" My mom looked at my dad and said, and I quote, ""Tim, holy fuck, did you HEAR that??!!"" He had heard it, and the both of them didn't sleep at all that night. The next morning they checked to see where the vent led to. It was right above the farmer's chair that he killed himself in in the basement.

OK, that's enough for now. There are more, but I'd have to call my parents to get a refresher on the other crazy shit they've seen.

I didn't really mind, because I'm usually up at that time anyways. So the building has three floors, and a basement and one person cleans each floor, except for the basement because we clean that one together. 
My first few days were fine; I didn't really experience anything. The next couple of days I would notice little things like doors being opened that weren't, doors that I locked becoming unlocked, the elevator opening with no one inside, and a hearing a few noises in the background. I usually put on my headphones while cleaning, so I didn't think about it much about the noises. These things happened only once or twice, so I never brought it up to anyone because I thought it was just me. The thing that did cause me to freak out a bit was what was happening in the women's restroom. Since I started, I noticed that the paper bag from the women's feminine hygiene trash compartment was always missing from the first stall, but when I would come back to put another one on, it would reappear. At first I thought I was being forgetful, until three days ago. So before going on break, I went to the restroom but I still had my cleaning gloves on so I threw them in the compartment. I took my break, and then I came back to clean the stalls. Well the gloves were no longer in the stall I put them in, but rather the stall at the very end. It honestly made me jump a bit. The worse part is that it happens everyday! I have honestly gotten used to it; every time I see a paper bag missing in that first stall I don't even bother to go get a new one because I know it reappears. 
So last night I brought up what happened to me to my supervisor. I was expecting her to think I was crazy, or laugh at me, but she just looked at me and said, ""I'm sorry I haven't mentioned this earlier, but yes, things happen in this place. I didn't want to tell you anything because I thought you would quit."" Apparently many people have left running from this place from experiences that have happened to them, including one who had a panic attack and passed out on her first day. During our break, everyone shared their experiences and each floor is notorious for a different activity and they mentioned that the basement was the worst, so that's why we all clean it together. They also told me that they used to cremate people in the building before they changed it to what it is today.

Its nice really nice and clam and shady which is nice on a hot day. Plus its behind a horse barn that he loves to visit. He was in his stroller and looked at a small plan grave, smiled and said hi little girl. I asked him where the little girl was and he pointed right beside this grave. I got a bit closer and it was a grave of a 5 year old girl. This is not the first time this has happened, but defiantly the creepiest. 

Just wondering if anyone has had any experiences with children doing this type of thing. When he was really little he used to always look over my shoulder and smile and laugh at nothing when I was changing him. I just sort of assumed it was my grandpa. After he passed I would find random pennies dropped around my and when I was pregnant with my son a penny fell from no where onto my belly when I was laying down. Hard right now to find out any more info as he's very limited verbally. Any info from anyone who has had similar things happen would be appreciated, or any other insight at all. Thanks!

EDIT: wow! thanks for all the responses. It'll be interesting to see if this is something he's still able to see as he grows. I'm defiantly the type of person who will try my best to have him feel comfortable with what he can see in the future if that's whats in store for him.

1344553828.0,80,self.Paranormal,xysfo,The campground that wasn't...,epoxypilot,90,10,53,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/xysfo/the_campground_that_wasnt/,"So the other day I was talking with my friends about some of the strangest things we've ever seen, and this really odd memory came up. I figured r/paranormal might enjoy tossing this one around, as it was truly the strangest thing that's ever happened to me. There was nothing really scary, and there was never any resolution, but still... you'll see. Bear in mind that this was all about 8 years ago, when I was still 14, but I'll tell it to the best of my ability. 

When I was 14, my dad and I had been driving up to North Carolina every spring for a father/son getaway since I was about 10. We always went to Cherokee, NC, and stayed at the Yogi campground there. But that particular year, we decided we wanted to try something different. We stopped about half an hour outside of town at a truckstop and gathered up some pamphlets showcasing our options. One of the nicer looking camps was tucked away up in the mountains, just like we like and had some really competitive prices. I wish I could remember the name, but it was a long time ago. (""Star-something"", maybe?) The pamphlet had the worst directions ever. Honestly just something like ""turn left and follow the road"". But the price was good and it looked nice, so we turned left and followed. 

At first, nothing seemed too odd. Broken down farm equipment and other such derelict machinery were all over, but nothing too noteworthy. But as we went on, we began to note how empty this road was. No turn off streets, no oncoming, no stores. But it was a real mountain road, all twisty and not a lot of shoulder, so what do you expect? Then we found some road construction- all abandoned. Cones are out, bulldozers and backhoes are there, but no people. So we start to talk about how empty this place is. Finally, we spot a gas station. Thinking we can get an idea of how far it is to the camp (it seemed like we had been driving forever), we pulled in. That's when we got set on edge. The gas station was old. We couldn't tell because it wasn't overly run down. Just some rust and patina. Typical for that area. But as we got out and looked around, it became very a-typical. Cars where still there, some old, some new. Some even in the bay to be worked on. The store was locked up, but we could see stock on all the shelves. But no people, no lights, and no answer when we pounded on the door. So we left, went on, and a few minutes later, as twilight approaches, we came up in the campground. 

As we rolled in, we immediately notice it's quiet. Overly quiet. But it's full. There was campers, RV's, trailers, cars, tents. Everything you would expect to see in a campground. But not a soul in sight. At first we thought it was just a slow night, and as we rolled under the big welcome sign we began to check it out. At this point we still thought we might be staying there, and we were scoping it out for a good spot. The camp was in the shape of a 0, with the entrance and exit at the tip of the 0, with campers and tents spaced along the perimeter. As we looked, we noticed the pool. It had obviously been left full over winter. Very unusual for such a cold place. But there were cracks all over the concrete, and standing water left in the bottom, recently melted and covered in leaves. It obviously hadn't been tended to in a while. We noted this as a negative in our decision process. So we began to look deeper for other flaws. I noticed that the road hadn't been tended to. The leaves where way too thick. But beyond that, no one had even driven over them in a long while. Because as we drove along we left tracks down to the gravel. If anyone else had been there since the leaves fell, they would have left the same tracks. And we started to see this place for what it was. Deserted. That's the only way to describe it. I realized that even though all the vehicles were present, they hadn't been moved in a while. They were all covered in leaves- hoods, windshields, tops, trunks. Old cars, some fifty years old, classic even. And new cars, only a couple years old. Same went for the campers, and the tents. At least one autumns worth of foliage. Looked like more. The place had not been touched in months, minimum. Maybe longer. There were picnic tables with stoves set up to cook on, just left there with utensils out, covered in foliage. The forest was taking this place back in no slow manner. And not a soul was to be found. When we took in the gravity of this emptiness, we yelled. We pulled up next to a camper with it's door open and we knocked on it. Then we yelled some more. No answer, and now it was creepy. We headed back up to the entrance, where the gift shop/front office was located to try and get some answers. 

The front office looked like any other from the outside. Just a cabin with a big welcome mat, and a few cars parked out front. Also unmoved for an obvious while. It was nearly dark as we pulled up to the drive-thru style window and looked inside, expecting to see someone appear. But no one did. The store was fully stocked, with windows open, including this drive-thru one. The only light came from an old school jukebox sitting in the corner, just glowing away. My dad yelled for someone, and no answer came. He yelled louder, really trying to get some answers, and then that damn jukebox kicked on. One of the creepiest things that ever happened to me. As the only source of light, we could clearly see that there was no one around it. But I'll never forget- it was ""Little Deuce Coup"" blaring away like it owned that place. My father and I shared a very big ""NOPE"" and got out of there. We took the road all the way back out without passing another car or seeing another soul, yet again. All the equipment and road work was still there, as was the gas station. But I'll be damned if we were stopping at that point. We went to the Yogi campground, and made camp there, happy just to settle in after the 16 hour drive. 

The next morning, that abandoned campground was all we talked about through breakfast. We had to know what that was all about. We resolved to go find it again, during the day, and hopped in the car. I was the navigator, so I went to pull out the pamphlet from my little folder, and it was gone. My dad thought I just lost it, but I KNEW I had put in there the night before. He was upset, and we shared words about being careless, but he was so gung-ho to find the place that we decided to drive back to the rest stop and retrieve directions. So we drove all the way out there, only to find that the damn pamphlet was nowhere to be found. Not like someone had taken them all, it was a nice stop and the spots were all stocked. It just wasn't among them. We tried to find the road again, because like I said, it was literally just ""turn left and follow"". But when we found the road we both agreed we had been down, it wasn't the same. It wasn't a windy mountain road. It went straight down about a mile to a dead end, with houses to either side. Maybe it was the wrong road, right? So we drove all around looking for the right one. Couldn't find it. Perplexed, we drove in to town and asked around. But no one had ever heard anything about it. We spent half the day looking for this place, and not another clue was found. That's the worst part- no answers. There was never any resolution, just the creepiest place I've ever been.

I know this was long winded, but I thought maybe r/paranormal may have some insight into this kind of this happening before, or maybe someone else having experienced something similar. If nothing else, maybe you can just take it as a story. Either way, feel free to comment or ask if anything needs clarification.

However, I have found zero evidence to back this up. Literally tens of millions of Ouija boards have been sold with [more Ouija boards sold than Monopoly](http://www.mitchhorowitz.com/ouija.html) at times. The modern Ouija board is over 100 years old and automatic writing similar to Ouija boards has been found to be at least a thousand years old (and is almost certainly older).

Despite this there is not a single shred of evidence that anyone has ever died from using a Ouija board. Annually approximately 120,000 people die yearly from accidents and 40,000 from suicide ([CDC](http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm) in the USA). [Hippos kill 3,000 people yearly, falling out of bed kills 450 annually and vending machines kill 14](http://www.oddee.com/item_98002.aspx). 24,000 people are [killed annually due to lightning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_strike).

This means that you are more likely to be killed by a hippopotamus, by falling out of your own bed, by a vending machine or by a lightning strike than to die from using a Ouija board.

There is far too much scare mongering on r/Paranormal in respect to Ouija boards. If Ouija boards do work - if they do contact spirits - then they are the single most powerful tool available. 

I would encourage people to do well-designed experiments with Ouija boards and record the results on a video camera. If ghosts, spirits or paranormal forces do exist - and the Ouija board can summon them - then try some experiments of this nature:

* Ask a spirit to predict a series of die rolls. If the spirit can consistently predict them with significant above-chance averages that would be strong evidence.
* Mix random cards ([Zener cards](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards)) and place them face down. See if the spirit can predict the cards accurately significantly above chance.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_19993v,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/19993v/ouija_boards_are_safe/,

My son new nothing about her.

Once when I was in college, probably around 2001, I was woken up at 3 AM by creepy odd voices coming from under my desk. At first I couldn't tell what it was, but eventually I could make out distinct but oddly distorted alien whispers. I could see under the desk from the bed, and obviously no killer was hiding there, but there were definitely muffled voices coming from inside the room.

After ten minutes of listening, too scared to move, I had to admit to myself I wasn't hallucinating. There was something strange and unnatural about the voices, but they were certainly real. Armed with my Swiss Army Knife, I investigated! (I'm not sure about ghosts, but Fey don't like iron blades... well, at least in D&amp;D they don't, so I figured I had the upper-hand :). 

It turned out that my desktop's surge protector had a crappy little speaker on it for beeping when it gets hit by a surge, and somehow it was picking up CB traffic. I never heard it before or after that night, but by extraordinary coincidence, that night every variable fell into place for the surge-protector's circuitry to pick up radio traffic. The speaker wasn't meant for any thing besides ""*beep!*"" so it mangled the words pretty badly. Nevertheless, if I put my ear up to the speaker I could make out distorted English. After the voices discussed local road features and used ""over"" to end sentences, I figured it probably wasn't ghosts... Moving the surge protector a few inches lost the signal and I wasn't bothered again. 

Despite being a skeptic, waking up to hear garbled whispers in the middle of the night was pretty shaking. So I pose this to you, what horrifying paranormal experiences have you had, only to find out it was something silly like a surge-protector?",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_shfkr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/shfkr/what_is_the_most_terrifying_paranormal_experience/,

We used to own 11 horses and numerous different animals. Anyways, a couple ladies at the barn had an animal communicator come out to talk to the horses so for the hell of it I signed my horse up. She was a very nice lady (even did it for free!). Even though I had my doubts (since so many of them ask for money when they read your animal) about the whole ""animal communicator"" thing.   
 
She explained that she sees images, when she touches the animal, of their experiences so it was up to her and us to interpret them. She pauses for a moment then she starts off by saying ""Wow you are wonderful"" (referring to my horse). ""He's very full of himself, he think he is just the prettiest horse in the barn, but he doesn't understand why no one likes him there"", she said, my heart drops. Ever since the move, he hasn't wanted to go out in the pasture with the other horses, all he wants to do is stay in his stall.  
  
She goes onto say how he loves when I get dressed up for shows, and how he is really sorry for being so bad for my sometimes, and how much he loves me because he gets to see me everyday. He also adds that he did not like his haircut and he kept saying that throughout the whole thing. He also said that his old home before this was very fancy, and the barn he's at now is just very gross and very dusty.    

The thing that really shocked me happened next. She asked him if she could rub his back and sides, she said he replied ""Just don't make fun of my scar"" and she points to his 1"" x 2"" patch of white hair right next to his hip (unless the horse is white, scars on horses grow back white). She said he told her ""people at the race track let him flip out of a very large trailer, then beat him to get off the ground"". I knew he flipped out of a trailer, but how could she have known?!    

She talked to my dog next. He was a stray that came to us on Christmas day a few years ago. His reading was kind of all over the place, jumping from one thing to the next, then back to the first thing. But that was his personality. She said he told her that his previous owners didn't love him, and they would talk about him when they thought he was listening so he just left. He stopped at our house because the Christmas lights were ""very warming"". He also thanked me for letting him sleep with me for the first few nights.

2/15: Object falls over Russia exploding over 500 kilotons of energy — compare that to the first nuclear bomb that dropped over Hiroshima measuring at a mere 15 kilotons. Despite the object weighing over 10,000 tons with a diameter of half a football field, this particular object was never detected by Earth information systems:

I am a sensitive but my parents nor brother are not. Since we built this house (I was 13, now 25) I have *ALWAYS* seen a man and knew there was a woman outside of the house on the east end. I never talked about it because I thought I was crazy. My brother saw the man once. 

My bedroom is at the end of a hallway, right across from my door is the door to the bathroom. At the beginning of the hallway is my brothers room then into the kitchen-dining-living (open floor plan). If you walk from the kitchen to the living room you pass through the ""dining"" area, on your right is the hallway. As you pass a man is either walking from my bedroom into the bathroom, from the bathroom into my bedroom or simply standing at the end of the hallway between the two doors. However, if you are the one at that end of the hallway, he walks down the hall toward you. I have seen this since the first night I slept in this house, 12 years ago. He stands outside my door and I have seen him plain as day. The woman however, is never inside and frightens me...

Now, I have believed this my whole life... But wasn't about to tell my dad, as I would seen insane to him. But I recently (last two weeks) moved from halfway across the country back to our home state. My wife and I are living with my parents until we find a place (two weeks now, hopefully not much longer). My dad asked if I had *seen* anything in the house, I was surprised. He described hearing someone in the house in the middle of the night. He knew it wasn't me as I was 1300 miles from home and my little brother lived 4 hours away. He thought either someone broke in or my brother had come home without letting anyone know. He got up (in his underwear) walked through the living-dining area and down the hallway as he saw someone go into the bathroom. He was freaked out when he turned the lights on and my brother wasn't there.... He goes back to sleep. Then as he is laying there, he looks out his door (the master is off the living room) and sees someone pass through the dining room and go down the hallway *again*. He jumps up throws on the light, my mom is freaking out and again... No one. I have been validated. I am not the only one who has seen this man!! Then he goes on to say he saw a woman walk pass the dining area (has 4 large windows) outside and when he went outside no one was there. They live a good 1/4 mile from the county road with a long white rock/dirt drive... No one would wander down here or drive without being seen. We also have dogs, a lot of them... So that is 2 for 2 that my dad has seen. I just wanted to share I guess, nothing more.

It was my first exposure to someone who took legitimate and often scientific interest in the paranormal. I was sad to see him go and I stopped listening after George Noory came in. 

My favorite were his Halloween shows, which he renamed to Ghost to Ghost for the occasion, asking for listeners with real life ghost stories to call in and tell them. It was great. Every Halloween I wish his show was still on in the glory that it was back in the 90s. 

At one point, I used some live streams of old recordings of his show that I would listen to, then those slowly started dying off. No one happens to know of any streams of his show that are still active? I would love to listen in again today. 

Just feeling nostalgic today on Halloween at what first really sparked my interest in the paranormal, and I'm hoping I'm not the only one who had the pleasure of listening to Mr. Bell back in the day.

Edit: Thanks for all the interest in my photo!  When I uploaded the original post I should have included a bit more information.  

I took the photo with my iphone 4.  No flash was used.  The church I went to was built in the 11th century.  Posted on the doors of the church were signs that said NO FLASH WITH CAMERA.  I took a ton of photos in darker areas than that, hoping that one would turn out to be cool and artsy.  I'm not a photographer, but I do enjoy art and I thought it might be fun to have a few pictures of a crypt with interesting light coming in from the outside.  

At the end of the trip I deleted a ton of photos from my iphone, they were either too dark or blurry or just not worth keeping.  I found this one and thought the image was really interesting.

I posted this in /r/paranormal because the first thing everyone said when I showed them the picture was, ""weird, I have no idea what that is, it looks like a face"".  I came here first to see if anyone had any idea on what it could be.  I never said ""Hey guys, look at this picture of a ghost that I took!""

To me its a fun photo that has prompted discussion, and I like that.

We got her when I was 9 and she faithfully slept curled up between my knees almost every night for 15 years.  It was a very sad thing for the whole family to lose her.  The whole house seemed sad and quiet without the sound of her whining at the back door to be let in or the little taps her paw would make on the door when she wanted you to open your bedroom door.  who knew one little shih tzu could leave such a big hole?

A few weeks after she died I was sitting in my room when I heard the sound of a dog whining at the back door, which sits underneath and to the left of my bedroom window. Instinctively, I got up to let her in when I remembered that Moomie wasn't there.  I sat back down, feeling sad, and figured I'd heard some distortion of the neighbor's labrador next door.  I sat back down and carried on, when I heard it again.  It was definitely at the back door.  I thought perhaps someone had brought home a lost dog - it's happened more than once - so I ran to the window and tried to get a good look at the back door, but I saw nothing.  I sat down confused and then heard it a third time and then I heard my brother yell ""DOG!"" like he always did.  I ran to my door and swung it open just in time to meet face to face with my brother, who had apparently had the same reaction.  ""You heard Dog, right?  That was the dog,"" he said and I sputtered an excited ""yes!""  We stood there a moment and laughed and then went back to what we were doing.  It happened on and off until I moved out.  Once in a while I could hear whining, or catch a glimpse of fur sitting in front of the back doors, and sometimes, if I left my door open just a crack, I would hear a scratch on my door and then the door would slowly creak open just enough for a Moomie-sized something to walk in.

Now that I live on my own I sometimes wake up to feel a pressure on the bed right between my knees where Moomie used to sleep.  I'm inclined to brush it off as muscle memory, until the pressure on the bed shifts like it's adjusting it's position.  Either way, it makes me happy that a part of her is still with me, whether it's in spirit or just in my mind.

My parents stayed in the guest room, my sister and I stayed in our cousin's room, my aunt and uncle stayed in their room, and one of my cousins stayed in her bedroom, all on the third floor.  My other cousin slept on the couch on the first floor.



Our first night there, my sister and I both woke up numerous times throughout the night to what sounded like something running up and down the hall.  Occasionally it would slow down to more of a walk, but it kept going off and on all night.  We thought everyone was getting up to use the restroom, or maybe the dog had gotten out.  
The next morning my sister brought it up to my aunt, who said, ""Oh that's just the ghost.""



She and my uncle went on to say that ever since they got married, 21 years ago, ""a presence"" as they called it has followed them no matter where they lived, and they've moved plenty of times.  In every apartment or house, in whatever hallway the bedrooms were located, the sound my sister and I heard would occur.  ""It marches up and down the hall.  It protects us,"" says my aunt.



They remember in one of their houses, when my cousins were 2 and 4 years old, they were sitting in the living room late one night and heard someone run up the stairs, far too fast for their kids' tiny legs.  They called for their children to no answer.  They went upstairs and both of the kids were asleep, and obviously had been for a long time.


My cousin, mentally sound, I might add, has heard her name whispered, said, yelled, and screamed countless times throughout her life.  This caused her parents to get her tested, but she is fine.



My uncle was hanging Christmas lights this past December, clinging precariously to a ladder on the side of their house.  He started to tilt backwards and very clearly felt a hand push him forward back onto the ladder.  Like they said, it protects them.



They're not scared of it.  They have no idea who it may be.  It has been part of their lives for twenty one years.

Mainly because I would almost never sleep. I always saw shadows moving around my bedroom (or a car would go by, every other shadow would move EXCEPT ONE, that kind of thing). I'd feel the cat climb into my bed, then reach down to pet him and he wasn't there. Scary noises. Faces in the dark. Things touching me. Cold spots. Pretty much every single spooky thing that could happen, DID. I'd cry and run to their room. They'd let me sleep with them.  

Peace.  

Until I was 8, and too old to be running to their room at night. I was terrified. I went to sleep almost every night after that thinking that the monsters were going to get me, that I was going to die (It really didn't help that my gram told me stories about monsters that eat you if your room is messy. awesome, gram). They told me i was imagining things. That I watched too many scary movies and spooked myself. I was crushed. I never brought it up again. I suffered in silence for 13 years. 

By high school I was a full blown insomniac. My grades sucked, i slept all day and stayed up all night with the TV on and ear plugs in, and through it all, i still FELT it. I NEVER felt comfortable sleeping in that house.  I moved out right after graduation and never moved back for any reason. I was actually homeless and couch surfing for a couple of months because I refused to sleep in that house. 

To prove how much I hate sleeping there, two years ago they went out of town for their anniversary and I was assigned to house-sit. I stayed on the couch. In my clothes. With my keys in my hand and ear plugs, and eye mask, and every ghost-repellant I could get my hands on. And I still didn't sleep. Not really.  

Well, yesterday my mom called me out of the blue. To tell me that I WAS RIGHT. She said she saw it. She was in the kitchen making coffee and something dark moved from her bedroom doorway directly across the hall to the bathroom in the dark. It was as big as dad (He's 6'6"") and almost fluid. All I could say, after being terrified for 13 out of the 18 years that I lived in that house, was ""I FUCKING TOLD YOU SO!!!"" (Now don't get me wrong, I wasn't angry with her, I was excited because I WAS RIGHT! ! !) She said ""Well, I just told it to get the hell out of my house, so let's see if that works.""

It is a nice three bedroom, two bath place on the first floor. The rent is cheap and it's in pretty good condition. About 1,500 sq feet. The place was formerly senior living apartments, which might be pertinent to this case. 

The apartment has a living room and kitchen, off the living room is a fairly long narrow hallway. That hallway has doors on the left and right to two bedrooms including the master bedroom...At the end of the hallway there are two more doors, the left goes to the third bedroom and the right door goes to a bathroom. 

Since we first moved in, my fiance has had the creeps about that hallway. I too sometimes get that hair-raising-tingley sensation towards the end of that hall. We set up that bedroom at the end of the hall as our computer room/office, so I've spent quite a bit of time in that room and have gotten used to it.

At first there was nothing out of the ordinary. We would hear sounds (thuds) at night from that general area of the place, which is strange because that end of the apartment does not have another apartment above it (That bedroom and the bathroom have a peaked roof above it). I mostly attributed those noises to our upstairs neighbor. They moved out and the apartment has been vacant for two months, but the noises continue.  It's a bassy single thud as if someone dropped something or knocked on a wall or the floor.

Over time odd things have started to happen, mostly centered in that far bedroom, the end of the hall, and the bathroom. My fiance frequently thinks she sees me walking through, when I am actually asleep. She sees shadows at the end of the hall. When I am sitting at my computer, I occasionally see a shadow move across my monitor and get the sensation that my fiance is behind me...I turn around and no one is there. I'd say thats the thing I notice most myself. I have seen a figure in my peripheral vision and dismissed it as my fiance, then looked up and not seen anything.

We have a newborn son. One time, he started to cry in the living room. I was in the bathroom when I heard his first outburst. Immediately after, I heard a second cry. It was closer, sounded female or like a little girl, and was almost in a mocking or mimicking tone. I registered that it happened and wrote it off. However, a few days later, without prompting my fiance mentioned that while I was at work she heard him cry and then heard a second cry immediately after. This time she was in the far bedroom across from the bathroom. She just about freaked when I told her I had heard something similar happen days before.

Just last week, I was outside having a smoke. A girl living in the apartment across from us was at her window. She asked me if I had ever heard noises in our apartment. I said yeah, sometimes, why? 

Without prompting from me she said ""that apartment is haunted. In that last bedroom down the hall. No one has lasted more than a year there."" It turns out the former occupants of our apartment had a daughter that was a friend of hers, and she had spent nights there in the past. That family had experienced similar going's on. She specifically mentioned the sounds and knocks. They also had a dog that was skiddish and anxious in that part of the apartment. They frequently found the dog shaking and terrified in the bathroom. She claimed that her friend had seen a woman or girl with wet hair on one occasion. The whole conversation just seemed to validate some of the weird things that had been occuring. My fiance has not been to that back bedroom or the bathroom since I told her about it.

Odd thing is, since I spoke with her I haven't noticed a single thing happen in the apartment. Nothing at all, and its making me doubt my reason and sanity. 

Where do I go from here? I am somewhat interested in ""reaching out"", but mainly I am keen to try and get rid of whatever it is, if it comes back. I have read about using Sage and am interested in trying that to cleanse the place. I am an agnostic, my fiance is a non-practicing catholic. We are open to suggestions.

I would be interested in evidence, maybe setting up a webcam or two and some mics to record. We also have a baby monitor that we could put in the back and listen in on. However with a baby in the picture I am less keen on that approach just for his sake and would rather have some peace of mind.

I'm done with this.  I can't handle this anymore.  I've tried ignoring it, I've tried to push it out, I've tried everything.  Nothing good has happened since I last updated.  In fact, things have gotten horribly worse. 
 
My roommate, and best friend, was critically injured at his job a couple weeks ago.  He's injured from his head to his toes.  If you want proof, here it is... [NSFW/ NSFL/ GORE](http://imgur.com/WPgMH5R)
  
He's going to live, thankfully.  I've been staying with him at the hospital for two weeks, now.  We were watching the hockey game last night on the TV in his room, when he told me that when he injured himself, he wasn't acting on his own accord.  He said it felt like a dream, and all he could do was watch through his own eyes.  I've tried to question him about this further, and he locks up and doesn't want to continue talking.  Whenever he begins to sleep he jolts awake.  The second night in hospital, *I had to hold his hand so he could sleep*.  
 
I'm keeping this brief.  This is unbelievably fucked up.  I don't care if you believe me or not.  I just want to show everyone that there are things that we do not know about, and we will probably never know about.  Don't do what we did and dig for answers.  I don't want this to happen to anyone else.  This is so fucked.
 
I'll try and check comments, but I haven't even turned on television since the accident.  This is the first time I've sat down with my computer, as well.

1354270593.0,71,self.Paranormal,141oqk,Unusual phone calls ,Nafetsg,88,17,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/141oqk/unusual_phone_calls/,"In 2008, over a span of a few months I received some calls from someone who simply seemed to have misdialled a few digits. 
At first I just dismissed it as a mere wrong number. He was so adamant in his vain attempt at inquiring info on the previous telephone number owner and he kept going to the point where we had established a little rapport through our strange dialogue. 

First call. It's a number and a voice that's completely unknown to me. Mid-20s, baritone voice asking for some 'Harrison'. He speaks a bit too fast, but overall his air is very ordinary. I simply tell him he has the wrong number. 

Later that day he calls a second time. Still seeking the aforementioned person. He calmly states the number he's trying to reach one-by-one, It's definitely my number(had it for years). He's very articulate, you had to try to mishear him. He's certain the number is correct. He doesn't sound close to whomever he's trying to contact. He politely requests info on whoever had the number before me or if I'm familiar with said person.
I knew nothing about it and thus was unable help him. The conversation ended, never did I expect to hear from him again.

The third call takes place the next evening. I'm vaguely annoyed at this point. His end of the line was swarming with ambient noise from a TV or something. 
""Oh, sorry. I guess the system is just messed up, hehe"" - He said affably 
He sounded like such a genuine nice guy, from now on our conversation was more social in nature. 
I asked him about the noise in the background, he said he was watching a hockey game and quickly turned down the volume a bit. 

""The Chicago Coyotes against the Vancouver Birds. The two giants are clashing!"" He said enthusiastically. 
I know nothing about ice hockey, so I changed he subject.
""So, there's a problem with the cell phone network?"" I asked
""The service for the 'ports'?"" he asks
""You mean the cellar phone network?"" I replied
""Everyone just calls them portables. Cellar is a technical term"" He said mirthfully.
""Huh, not really, at least not where I'm from. Maybe in Canada, or maybe they say 'mobile' up there. Where are you from anyway?"" I asked
""Illinois. Teiloj(or 'Teilhoj')"" He repleid
""Oh, a fellow Illinoisan. Is that a town? can't say I've heard of it"" I asked   
""It's a city in the north western region. It's actually rather well-known"" He said

What was left of our talk was just chit-chat and more awkward miscommunication, we never spoke again. 
I was sitting down at my desk during the whole duration of the call. Out of curiosity I googled this place he mentioned, it returned no significant results, but I was unsure on the spelling. 
I made a search for those hockey teams as well, they didn't even exist. I looked up terms for cellular phones, nowhere is 'ports' or 'portable' commonplace according to wikipedia. His number was listed in a directory, I dialled it a week later, some elderly man picked up, certainly not him.
The ""well-known"" city really captivated me, It's not a registered name anywhere, I've tried every possible variation on the spelling, nothing shows up. 
Moreover, I realized much later on that 'Teiloj' could may well be just 'Joliet' backwards, which was my city of residence at the time.     

If it was a prank, then props for the subtlety and elaborateness. I lead a somewhat solitary life and I can't think of anyone who would subject me to this. I think it's safe to say that I have a firm grasp on reality, but I'm unsure what sort of impression this has left me with.

To be honest I laugh and scoff at most ""paranormal"" occurrences I read or hear. But this experience was enough to make me into a full on believer of the unknown. Well, to be honest not a full believer but just enough to scare the hell out me. 

Ok so recently we had just moved into a new house in Burbank and we have been in the process of unpacking and setting furniture up around the house and what not. My brother and I have been in charge of moving most of the heavy stuff up stairs and basically just making the house look homely. But about three days ago I was picking him up from work to come back to the house with me because the cable guy was coming by to the new house and one of us had to be back there to meet him and let him in and show him where we need what not. As we are pulling in to the house my brother tells me he wants to check the shed for a rake or to see if we even brought it from the old house. He gets out of the car first and opens the side gate leading toward the backyard. I'm left in the front about to walk inside the front door until I hear my brother say "" Bro what are smiling at?"". Which confuses me who hes calling bro and who hes talking to in general since we're on opposite ends of the house. Puzzled I go through the living room through to the back and I see hes running towards the door and as he sees me he stops, and looks at me puzzled and confused. I ask him who is talking to and whats wrong. 

He says "" How'd you get inside so quickly?"" 

I tell him I walked in through the front and heard you talking whats wrong? He tells me to stop fucking with him, and this makes me even more confused. I asked him "" Wait what are you talking about?"" He looks at me with a real hard stare, and goes "" You really weren't standing there?"" I ask him "" Where?""  After this point he stops and steps back frantically and runs back into the front and runs back to me circling the house looking around. Now hes really frightened and I'm still here confused since its only us two on the property. He runs back to me and with a complete straight face he says 
""Dude I know you think this is crazy but you were standing right on the  deck just smiling at me. You wouldn't stop smiling"". I tell him to relax and I was inside but then he grabs me and says "" I swear you were standing right there (points at our deck) and you were still, and you were just giving me this obnoxious smile that wouldnt break, as soon as asked you what you were looking at you bolted back to the side gate out of my vision, thats why I was chasing you"" At this point I know when my brother is serious and when hes joking and hes completely frantic trying to convince me that I was there. I've never had or heard of an experience like this but my brother tells me they are called ""Doppelgangers"" and that they are omens of bad luck or whatever google told him. The cable guy didnt come until at least 40 minutes after all this and my brother approached the guy with the question if hes ever had this kind of experience and he looked at us like we were crazy or high. 

I dont know how to make sense of any of this but I hate to think there is an omen of bad luck with my face on it.

In this instance I became friends with a girl who was in the fourth grade.

Tammy would have me over to her house after school. Her mother was always home with her brothers and would serve cookies and milk which was a real novelty to me as I was a latchkey kid from a single parent household. It was late May when I went to Tammy’s house after school. 

I called my mother at work to let her know where I was then proceeded to play with Tammy and her brothers. Another friend of hers came over to play and started talking about how his dog had had puppies and everyone decided they wanted to see them. The house with the puppies was a street over, but it really wasn’t far if we went through the ally and so we did.

The dog was awesome and the puppies were cute, but the boys were grossing me out by tweaking the dog’s nipples and spraying milk at the girls. Being older and sensitive to the needs of kids younger than myself, especially lonely ones since I was myself I became aware of someone looking at me through the fence from the neighboring back yard. 

A little boy with the strangest blue eyes was standing there staring at me. He was terribly pale and looked very sad, so I did what I did as an extremely empathic child.

He seemed almost fearful as I walked up to him, but he didn’t move. I told him hello and introduced myself. He told me his name, but I don’t remember what it was. He seemed very surprised that I was talking to him. Over his shoulder I could see another little boy playing with trucks in the dirt with his back to me. I returned my gaze to the boy. He couldn’t have been any older than eight. He kept his eyes on my face, meeting my gaze in a way I was unused to and I had to say I was slightly unnerved because it was such an intense look.

“Would you like to come over and play with me and my friends? The dog just had puppies and they’re really cute.” 

""I can’t” he told me as his expression saddened. 

“Why not?” I asked. 

“Because my dad is in prison,” The little boy answered. I thought it was a strange answer but before I could question him further my friends called me out to the front yard because we were going a few houses down to see if yet another kid could play. 

“I’m sorry,” I told him, said my goodbyes and walked through the gate to the side of the house. I looked back over my shoulder as we left and saw that he was standing on the edge of the lawn on the front yard. His eyes didn’t waver from mine. He didn’t blink. He just stared. It really freaked me out.

Later that evening I was still bothered by my interaction with the little boy. Something just didn’t seem right so I told my mom about the boy. She asked me to take her to see the house as I couldn’t describe which one it was. I held her hand as we walked around the block then down the street then stopped in front of the house. It seemed to me to have a heavy feeling to it. It was empty. I expressed my confusion and my mother put her arm around me as we walked back home.

She told me that she knew the family that had lived in the house. She had worked with the boys mother. The marriage was falling apart and she had asked her husband for a divorce. He didn’t take the news too well so one evening when she was at work he shot and killed both of the boys and tried to kill himself and failed. He was at that time in prison for the murder of his sons. I remember being very quiet before asking my mom if she thought I’d talked to a ghost. She said it was very likely that I did.

I never went back to my friends house after that. I did babysit one time at the house on the other side of the house where the boys were killed by I wouldn’t look over at the yard. The house sat empty for a long time. People would move in stay a very short time and move out.

The last I saw the house someone was living there and the house seemed different, brighter. I just hope those boys found peace. 

How could I have spoken to a ghost? I’ve not spoken to one since that I know of, though I’ve had more than my share of ghostly encounters. None of them has been as sharp and real as the little boy.  I often wondered what would have happened if I had reached out and touched him. Would he have been solid? Would my hand have gone through him? Would he have disappeared. I’ll never know. But still I will never forget his strange eyes staring at me so intently.

1334544164.0,71,self.Paranormal,sbr74,This experience is what convinced me that ghosts are real. ,GhostWaitress,82,11,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/sbr74/this_experience_is_what_convinced_me_that_ghosts/,"This was many years ago, I was about 20 years old. I was at a local diner that had been around for many years (since the 1940s) and was very widely reputed to be haunted by the wife of the man who owned the place. They had started the diner together, but she died about 10 years afterward. I had been going to this place for several years and we were all very familiar with it, but I had never had any kind of paranormal experiences there (or anywhere else, for that matter). 

I was with two friends at the diner and we were just sitting there smoking cigarettes and drinking coffee (which tells you about how long ago this was). No drugs, alcohol or other substances were involved, and I remember every detail of this moment with absolute clarity. All three of us saw the phenomenon and it was very bright inside. It was around 3 am and we were the only patrons. The only other people in the cafe were the night cook and the night waitress. 

I was sitting opposite my two friends, with my feet kicked up on the booth seat. We were just casually chatting about various topics as good friends are wont to do. We had been there for about an hour, I think. The waitress was not present, she was probably out back smoking and talking to the cook. 

I was looking across the table at my friends who were at the time engaged in conversation, and who were looking at each other while they spoke. Suddenly, my coffee cup moved on it's own. When I say moved, I don't mean that it wobbled or anything. It actually turned about 180 degrees and then SLID about 10 inches away from me, toward the end of the table. I sat bolt upright, and stared at the cup in horror and said to my friends ""Did you see that?!"" They hadn't seen it move. I told them what had just happened, and of course they were skeptical. Until it moved again. This time we all three witnessed it turn about another 10-15 degrees and slide across the table. This time it slid toward them, moving about another 6-8 inches across the table. Finally, a few seconds later, it turned again just slightly, and slid back towards me, traveling about a foot this time. It literally looked for all the world like a ghost  waitress had grabbed my cup, filled me up and then pushed the cup back toward me. 

We were completely speechless at this point, and were still in a state of shock when the real waitress came to check on us. When she did, we told her our tale, and she said that it was the owner's wife, that she did that sometimes, moving plates or cups on patrons' tables late at night. 

I'm a born skeptic, and always have been, but that experience was so extraordinary that I have not ever found a reasonable explanation as to how my cup could have moved on its own. 

* Nothing else on the table or anywhere else near us moved at the same time.
* All parties witnessing the event had their hands fully visible the entire time.

1376008067.0,71,self.Paranormal,1jzsrv,My mom's boyfriend believes his sister is possessed.,SnazzyPat,96,25,54,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1jzsrv/my_moms_boyfriend_believes_his_sister_is_possessed/,"My mom and her boyfriend recently visited his sister, Deb, to drop off something at her house. I'm not sure what exactly but it doesn't matter. He told my mom that her house is extremely haunted and advised her not to go in with him so she didn't. When they came back, he told me all about his sister and the house. 

She has appeared on the show Paranormal State in 2009. I think most paranormal shows of its kind (ex. Ghost Hunters, A Haunting) are dumb but wanted to see this episode regardless. The episode is titled ""The Possession: Return of the Six"" and according to Wikipedia, it is the fifteenth episode of the third season if you would like to watch it for yourself. 

It all started as soon as she and her husband moved in, as you would expect. Deb's other sister, Donna, came to stay for a while after getting a divorce. After the second night, Donna told her that someone had been watching her in the doorway as she tried to sleep, describing it as ""darker than the dark"" and that it looked like a ram. She said it told her not to be afraid and that it could help her. A week later she killed herself by jumping into a nearby river. The entity appeared to Deb right after and told her ""Don't be afraid. I can help you. I helped Donna. I can help you too."" This is all described in the episode of Paranormal State. I could go on and on but if you watch the show, you can get more of the details.

I also want to share some experiences not mentioned in the show such as what happened once when my mom's boyfriend visited, which is a rare occurrence because of this fact. They were both in their living room talking about everything that goes on there, as he was trying to make sense of it all because he had never believed in anything like the paranormal. So he said aloud, ""If something is really here, do something."" Just as he said that, his coffee mug started slowly sliding of the table in front of him. He immediately left after that and has never returned. Another detail about Donna's suicide not mentioned in the show is the fact that no water was found in Donna's lungs when her body was recovered from the river, showing that technically she did not drown. Of course there is always an explanation for these things but it's just something sorta worth noting. They once performed an exorcism on the house which ultimately did nothing. The priest who helped do it, refused at first. Saying that the demon sounded like one mentioned Bible, Azazel, who Adventists teach that the scapegoat is a symbol for Satan.

I have always taken great interest in the paranormal so once he told me about all of this, I wanted to experience it for myself. I have never experienced anything paranormal in my life before so I can't say I believe but he said he would be willing to take me to her house and see if I could experience anything. I won't lie, the thought absolutely terrifies me and I don't know how much I'd be able to witness or go through but it also fills me with excitement. If I were able to go, I would ask to bring my video camera to see if I could capture anything and/or maybe have a discussion with his sister on video. I apologize if it seems like there are a lot of missing details or if any part seems confusing or incorrect but my mom's boyfriend doesn't like to talk about it that much so it's all I've gotten.

I'm really new to this so please let me know what you think, Reddit. And if you have any questions, feel free to ask.

I like to take my dog out on late night walks around 10 or 11, sometimes even later. It's nice for me because I love the night, and nice for my dog because it's not too hot for him. (He has thick black fur.) 

We sometimes see creepy stuff at night, like road kill or strange animals, but usually the neighborhood is very peaceful. One night, however was a bit different. I was walking the dog up a hill and I notice that he'd perked up quite a bit, and was quietly woofing and panting in the direction of a house about 40 feet up the street. I looked up and saw this strange, large, hazy white thing rapidly circling around the house. It was white, and was flapping? I think, but not in a way that a bird would. The creepy thing about this is how hazy the memory has become, I know it wasn't a dream because I clearly remember the rest of the walk and coming back home very confused and scared. 

Anyway, my dog is pulling me towards whatever it is, as it circles the house about 10 or 15 times and disappears behind the house, somehow I don't remember, I'm not sure. When I say this thing was big, I mean it. It was definitely about a meter tall vertically, and maybe less than a foot wide. It seemed to be flapping but with its ""wing"" facing the ground so it's on its side. It definitely wasn't a bag, because it repeatedly circled the house in these wide swoops. The best answer I can give is a disabled albino mega-bat that decided it would cruise around a random suburban house and then disappear. 

What gets me is how hazy it looked, like it didn't have a definite form. (As if it was blurred at the edges.) An off, grainy white it was, swooping around and around in the dark.

What could it have been? 

EDIT: I made a shitty animation, enjoy. It's not perfectly accurate, it was lever with the house as it circled around it.  http://i.imgur.com/ITMCMBm.gif

EDIT 2: So it's looking like it might be a white ray (the sea dwelling kind) cryptid, which is really weird but it definitely fits the bill. Or a kite, like my brother kept repeating.

My old house, in Chalmette, La. before Katrina, was haunted. My uncle shot himself when I was very young and my mom took it very hard. She spread some of his ashes on his old drum set that was in our garage, and placed the vase with his ashes on the mantle of the fireplace in the living room on the other end of the house. Every day after that the house had a different feeling. There was an energy there that hadn't been there before. Every single person that walked into my house saw things in their peripheral vision that wasn't there, or would feel an unexplainable cold come over their body. There was always a distinct feeling in the house that you weren't alone and everyone felt it. I remember babysitting my little sister. She was knocked out on the couch while I watched tv in the living room. I saw shadows moving in the kitchen all night. The electronics would flicker and the tv would randomly shut off. This went on for years, but it was never threatening. It was almost comforting. Until... During the summer one year the spirit changed. The energy changed. It was darker. We would hear voices saying ""Leave"" and ""Go"" throughout the night. Clawing noises against the walls were heard by everyone in the house. Objects would inexplicably fall. I remember watching a bottle cap crawl up the wall in the kitchen. Then it got worse. Every single night for weeks one of us (2 sisters, mother, father) would wake up with a dark figure with long, dark hair standing over us as we sleep. We figured it was my uncle because he had long hair, but this figure didn't seem welcoming. The figure whispered ""leave"" the 2 times he appeared to me as I slept. This went on for 3 weeks, and then Hurricane Katrina hit... we left. My house was on the street where the levees broke. 20 feet of water flooded into all the houses in less than 5 minutes. To this day we think the spirit of my uncle was telling us to get the hell out because of the storm. We went back to clean the house out, everything was destroyed, but the vase of ashes was sitting delicately on top of my uncle's snare drum. As I write this I realize how unbelievable and ridiculous it all sounds.

First let me start of by apologizing for taking so long to get back to everyone.  I know I kind of left everyone hanging, but there were a few problems, unrelated to this incident, that forced me out of town for some time.  I was left browsing Reddit on my phone, so I couldn't do much other than make a post essentially saying: ""Everyone has to wait a couple weeks.  Calm yourselves"".  I don't think that would've went over well.
 
For those of you who have no idea what the living hell I'm talking about, [here's a link to the original story I posted about a month back.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18xznv/last_week_i_believe_i_had_my_first_paranormal/)
 
First, I'm sure everyone wants to hear what's happened in the last few weeks.  My roommate and I went to my neighbor's ""party"" that weekend.  Calling it a party is giving it great injustice, more of a family get together where mee-maw's yelling about someone getting her teeth so she can eat this damn corn on the cob.  Fortunately, there was no shortage of booze to be found and we were able to slip in without too many confused old people mistaking us for their grandchildren.
 
Before my friend and I went there, we had decided on a plan of action.  We know the neighbor's kid (Yes, *the* kid) likes to drink.  Quite a bit.  He also has been known to imbibe in pot.  Especially when he's drunk.  After sitting around and talking about it over a game of hockey on the PS3, we decided upon this fail-proof plan: 
 
**STUPID PLAN:**
* Step One:  Go over to the party, settle in, hang around neighbor's son.
* Step Two:  Get neighbor's son **really** drunk.
* Step Three:  Get neighbor's son high.
* Step Four:  Hope that he tells us something.
 
Like I said:  Fail-proof, one-hundred percent.
 
As the night progresses we find the opportunity to pull him behind the pole barn to smoke a joint.  I don't smoke anymore, so it was just between my roommate and him.  I was just there to ask questions.  We were trying to pull of some elaborate good cop/ bad cop routine, but both of us are colossal fuck-ups, so I don't think we we did a great job.  This is basically how it went down:
 
Me: ""So, man, I haven't really seen you in some time.  How have you been?""
Roommate: ""We need to hang like this more often.""
Neighbor:  ""I'm doing okay.  You guys are over here trying to get me fucked up.""
R: ""Yup...""
Me: ""You've got to handle family get-togethers some way, right?  Anyways, [name redacted] I've got a serious question that I've been meaning to ask you.""
*At this point, my neighbor becomes visibly agitated.*
N: ""Yeah.  What's up?""
*I hate physically intimidating people, but it had been bothering me for a whole week.  I dropped the facade, squared my shoulders off, and stepped in his face.*
Me: ""What the fuck happened last Sunday?""
N: ""What?""
*We both stared each other down for twenty seconds, or so.  Yes, I'm coming off as aggressive, and he's drunk, but he keeps shifting his gaze off to the side*
RM: ""Man, we don't want to start anything.  We just want some answers.""
N: ""To what?""
Me: ""To what happened last fucking Sunday!""
*My friend got in between me and my neighbor.  I was getting unnecessarily mad.  Looking back at it, I really wanted to fight him, or hurt him in some way.  Not my usual train of thought*
RM: ""Even I know you're lying, man.  We both saw you, and you weren't acting right.  You were acting pretty fucked up.  I came to your house and you answered the door.  He saw you in the woods, and you fucking did something!""
*Now it's my turn to try to calm my roommate down.  He doesn't get angry, easily.  This startled me, a bit.*
N: ""STOP!""
*If this was a movie, this is where the music drop would be*
Me: ""Tell us.  We're going to find out whether you want us to or not, at this point.  You're looking at two people, right now, who think they're going crazy.""
 
I don't remember exactly what he said, but I'll summarize it for you.  Since October of last year, he's been hanging around with a different group of friends than what he used to run with.  He used to hang out with the local, redneck-type kids.  Working on cars, riding four-wheelers, etc...  His new group of friends, however, really liked drugs (I'm not talking pot, here, folks.  He mentioned abusing a few controlled prescriptions, smoking crystal meth (He actually said ""Tried,"" but you ""Try"" something once.  He said he had done it more than a few times.)  His new group of friends also were very goth/emo, wore dark clothes, dyed their hair black, liked leather, y'now the type.  They believed themselves to be Wiccans, according to him, and they performed many a ritual at the house over the following months.  Calling out ""entities"", wanting to witness something paranormal, I guess.
 
His parents had caught him right after Christmas performing some type of ritual with his new group of friends.  His parents gave him an ultimatum:  Move out and keep hanging out with your friends, or live in this house and ditch your friends.  He chose the latter.  Well, not really.  He would still meet up with his friends.  Not at his house though.  He would meet them in the woods, in the middle of the night.  He told us he continued to practice until his parents found out, again, and cut him off from everything.  I wasn't exactly sure what he meant by that, but my best guess would be that they used to pay for his phone, car insurance, etc.., then started making him pay for everything, using the small amount of money he makes at his job.
 
This was a **huge** turning point for me and my friend.  We weren't losing our minds, because the neighbor's kid was practicing witchcraft next door!  Makes perfect sense now, doesn't it?  Nope.  We continued to prod him about that weekend, but he said he stopped meeting his friends and practicing witchcraft in mid-January and vehemently denied doing anything that weekend, other than work.  After he told us everything, we spilled what we knew onto him.  I told about my encounter with *him* in the woods.  My friend told about his encounter with *him* at his house next door.  I told him about feeling like I was momentarily sent to another dimension, the reverse-weightless feeling I experienced, the time-travel or ""slip"" that put me down the trail so fast.  By the time all three of us were done talking, we were shaking from head to toe.  I could almost feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins.  I could feel the blood rushing in my ears, and my face getting warmer.  We tried to say some normal goodbyes to everyone, but we didn't mean any of it.  We just wanted to get back to our home, where everything was normal.  For the most part.
 
After analyzing everything that happened over that week, we came to the conclusion that he's still hiding something from us.  *Something* must have happened that early Sunday evening while I was walking my dog.  I don't know what.  The helpful posters have speculated everything from demonic possession, alien abduction, multiple universe theories, drugs dispersed into the air, schizophrenia, to my own physical and mental health.   I've always speculated that there is some type of ""under current"", if you will, of energy coursing through the world that us humans couldn't even begin to understand.  I think the kid messed with something he shouldn't have, got it's attention, and it's having it's fun.  

We both have also been seeing things.  I'm not saying we're seeing ""ghosts"", or ""demons"", or anything like that.  We might not be ""seeing"" anything at all, and our brains are just collapsing under the stress.  There are eerie connections to some of our stories, though.  For example, we both see something white dart around the corner in the downstairs hallway from time to time.  It always goes left, never right.  We both hear our names whispered in the house from time to time, as well.  I'm shaking thinking about that, because I'm having a tough time reasoning with that.  It's one thing to think that you saw something round that corner just as you walked out of the room, and a whole different thing when you're doing the dishes and it sounds like someone said your name from the stairwell.
 
Needless to say, we're both incredibly stressed out.  Here's a weird fact, though.  When I was out of town, nothing happened to me, at all.  I didn't see any phantoms rounding the corner in the hotel I was staying at, I never heard my name being called, unless an actual person was saying my name, of course.  When I got back home about a week ago, I started seeing/ hearing things again.  
  
Just to make sure, I've talked my friend into going to a group session with a psychiatrist.  We're planning on holding back a couple of details, otherwise, we're going to tell him the majority of the things that are happening to us.
 
I'll try to answer a few questions that I remember before I start posting links to the pictures:
 
**Is your neighbor 18 or 21?**
*I get confused.  I know he's in his early twenties, and if I had to guess, I'd say he just turned twenty-one.  His parents are very Catholic, and would've kicked him out if they caught him drinking before he was of age*
 
**Why are my neighbors having a party while their daughter is in a coma, inside the house?**
*Because life goes on, I guess.  Medical professionals tend to her, she's completely unaware of anything around her.  I hate to use the word ""vegetable"", but it does apply.  Also, it was a family gathering.  I know a lot of the family members went there to see how their daughter was doing.  Me and my roommate get invited to every type of get together they have going on.*
 
**Why bother mentioning your third roommate (The blissfully-ignorant girl), when she doesn't have much to do with the story?**
*I mainly included her in there to convey how terrified I was.  I didn't want my roommate to go over to the neighbor's house until she had gotten home.  I didn't want to be alone in the house, anymore.  I would also like to point out that she has made no mention of anything odd happening to her, but we didn't really ask her about it.*
 
**This isn't your first paranormal experience.  You posted a comment in r/nosleep about an experience you had.**
*That isn't a question, but I'll reply to it, anyway.  The short story I posted in r/nosleep was a little something I typed up while on the road.  It had been sitting on my laptop for months, friend told me to post it in a thread because she liked it.  You are aware that there's a big difference between r/nosleep and r/paranormal, right?*
 
**Don't shoot your friends.**
*K.*

[I find this image very hard to make out](http://imgur.com/WIb5iN2):  This is where ""My Trail"" dead-ends at the ""Main Trail.""  If you were to turn left here, you could take a small footpath dubbed the ""East Parallel Trail"", which runs down the east side of my property line and towards my pole barn.  Turn right and it takes you deeper into the woods.
 
[My dog heading left at previously mentioned junction](http://imgur.com/aZFVk5j):  She **never** does this, she always turns right to go deeper into the woods.  It kind of unnerved me.  She didn't even check behind to see if I was following her.  (She knows the trails very well, and probably got on the ""East Parallel Trail"" to head back to the house.)
 
[Me still at the ""My Trail""/ ""Main Trail"" junction.  Looking North](http://imgur.com/cUMLmbo):  A few yards up and you'll find the ""East Parallel Trail"", which runs you straight to the pole barn, which you can see off in the distance.

[The ""Main Trail"" heading South](http://imgur.com/xIgQDff)
 
[The ""Main Trail""/ ""West Parallel Trail"" Junction](http://imgur.com/VVsfSdh):  To the left of the image you can see the ""Main Trail"" continue to snake its way deeper into the bush.  The unwalked trail to the right of the image is the South Connector to the ""West Parallel Trail"".
 
[A little ways down the ""West Parallel Trail"", heading back to my house](http://imgur.com/gGtCrAN):  You're about .35 miles, as the crow flies, from my backyard at this point.  I really did not want to go down this trail just to take a picture to show strangers on the internet.
 
[This is it.](http://imgur.com/LlgOx2r):  That's the one everyone has been wanting to see.  That is, by my approximation, the spot where I saw my neighbor.  Pretty anti-climactic, isn't it?  I might be off by a few feet, but I remember the weird, bowed tree being behind him.
 
[After I ""Blacked Out"", this is where I came to](http://imgur.com/kgNjuLZ):  This is way down the ""West Parallel Trail"", from where I took the last picture.  I still don't remember walking.  Just that 'tug', not in Kansas anymore, 'gut-wrenching reverse gravity feeling', standing there.
 
[This is very near to where I woke up](http://imgur.com/Wk5hQfP):  Not entirely sure why I felt compelled to take a picture of this, but I did, so you get it.  When we first moved in, I remember this being a dumping ground for tree stumps and other crap that wouldn't burn easy.  We've been making it bigger ever since.  It's just always creeped me out for some reason.

Since around the third grade (I'm 27 now) something has been trying to tell my body to go somewhere - I think. I first noticed it when I was at a slumber party and the girl lying next to me said ""stop moving"" (please note this is not sleepwalking as someone suggested, I am fully aware of what is happening, fully awake and I can allow or disallow the movements at will) . Basically what happens is that my body begins to move on it's own. I will actually turn over, bend my legs, get up and walk, etc (not normally, mind you, my husband says I look like a zombie/possessed person) Out of curiosity, I let it continue for awhile but stopped when ""it"" led me to my front door (I certainly wouldn't want to do this in public) - Again I'm am not doing this. I have no idea where ""it"" is taking me. Perhaps my subconscious is telling me to go somewhere from my past? I don't know. While I can stop it whenever, I worry that if I carry on for too long I might not be able to.  It certainly hasn't been a problem but it is quite puzzling. Does anyone have any ideas? Has anyone else experienced such things?

I usually just entertain myself with everyone's posts, I think I rarely miss any of them. Anyway, today its raining, and there's thunder and lightning. Naturally I went straight to /r/paranormal to help give me a nice healthy dose of fear. And I'm sitting here, reading about some guy's appliances going out, and it occurs to me that I've witnessed something like this. Not *really* like it, but it definitely sparked the connection in my brain. 

I am 20 now, mind you. This happened when I was fifteen. My mom would go through little bouts of missing simpler times, and family that was on the other side of the country and she'd go through this box of oldddddd home movies and play them in this GIGANTIC video camera that my grandpa had passed onto her once he'd upgraded. (this thing had to be from like the early 80's, mid 80's) So my mom is in one of these moods, and she's trying her damndest to get the thing hooked up to our tv, and she's fucking around with the audio cables, and trying to get the picture to stop showing static, etc. I'm several feet in front of her in a different room, on the computer; religiously using my myspace account. I can see her, but she cannot see me.  (The room I was in was elevated due to us having one of those drop down living rooms with three stairs leading into our basin chill zone of happy fun time)
Now, one more thing about the old video camera, is that it had a little microphone on it; like telemarketers that wear those head sets have sticking off the side by the ear piece. Except its a little bigger, but like you can actually see it on there. At this point, she's been trying to get this thing all hooked up for about thirty minutes. The tv is still only displaying static, and the audio hasn't come through at all yet. My little sister enters the room asking what she's doing, and then proceeds to set up shop a the coffee table so she can do all her homework. So at this point, its Cami (the little sis) in the living room, and my mom (in the living room, closer to me than to Cami) and myself in the dining room (closer to my mom than anyone, but out of her viewing range). 
My mom has just declared that she's finally figured out what she has to do, and connects the mic to something in the back of the tv:

not even three seconds afterwards, the screen on the tv (still currently doing normal static) kind of... glitches? I don't know how to describe it. It was like something was flowing through it, but on a different frequency than the standard static that had been happening for the last thirty minutes. Nearly simultaneously with the visual occurrence (I'm talking like a third of a second immediately following it) this *warped* voice, that sounded closer to a growl than anything comes through the tv's speakers at an off-puttingly normal volume; not too quiet and not loud (like someone was in the room with us, but they were right where the tv is) And it says ""CAMI"". So, everyone hears this, and I look at my sister and she's got these saucer eyes and I'm staring at her too and I hear my mother from behind the tv mutter ""what the fuck?"" and then she pops up into my viewing range and says, ""Reye, *dont scare your sister*. She looks terrified. I, at this point am on my feet heading for her, scared shitless advocating that it wasn't me. Cami, at this point is still in shock sitting on the couch with this terrified look on her face.  Just as I reached my mother (this took a total of about  two minutes, since the initial voice) the voice come's through the speakers again; although this time its LOUD and its growl is fucking terrifying. The warbled, warped way it pronounced her name made my blood run cold. My sister was sobbing before the thing was done uttering her name and my mother had crossed the room to her just as quickly. I stood there for a second next to the tv, then sprinted to be with them. We all huddled on the couch together, staring at the static, waiting for something else to happen. Nothing ever did, now or ever. 

This story; took place over the course of about thirty five minutes. The actual voice phenomena takes place in the last three minutes. 
My sister is now fourteen, and normal; nothing ever came of this and we don't really understand why it happened at all. 
This is by far the most terrifying and inexplicable experience I've ever had with the paranormal. We have never been sure just what happened, but we all agree something *did* happen. There was not a tape in the camcorder at the time this happened. The microphone picked up something that night. Something saying my sister's name.

It was 2007, mid-spring, and I was driving home at around 2AM from a late night movie with two friends (S and B).  We were the only people on Main street other than the car behind us, which was another two friends, A and G.
 
Approaching an intersection, my driver side rear view mirror suddenly slammed against the window and hung from it's bracket.  It wasn't as if it had been pushed shut, it was just all of a sudden there.  I never really saw it move, but I looked right at it as soon as I heard the noise and it just seemed to have shifted real abruptly.  My first thought was that I hit something, like a bat or some other type of animal, but I never saw anything at all (and the street is well lit, even late at night).
 
S screamed asking what it was, and I just chuckled and said I didn't know.  B was turned around and looking out of the back of the Jeep, sort of muttering to himself ""Wha... Wha... What?"" Finally turned around and began to say things like ""Did you see that?"" and ""How did you not see that?""  S was growing frightened, and so was I, just because of how scared and pale B looked.  I didn't see a thing.
 
A and G sped up immediately to get next to me at the next light, which was only about 300 feet away.  A rolled the window down.
 
""Dude, what was that?  Did that come off of your car?""
""I didn't see anything at all, what was it?""
""HOW DID YOU NOT SEE THAT?""
 
At this point, everybody is saying the same thing, but isn't really able to get a word out otherwise.  The confusion subsided and they all explained the same thing - which only S and myself seemed to miss.  We discussed.
 
Apparently, something large, maybe close to the size of a bowling ball, fell from the sky, and clipped my mirror at the same time.  They all described it the same way - A dark, almost shadowy mass that was transparent but still a little reflective (almost metallic), which was glowing a dark orange color, and bouncing, about twenty feet into the air.  It made no noise whatsoever.
 
After it had hit my mirror, it slammed against the ground and went straight back up into the air, bouncing over A and G in the car behind us.  B continued to watch it bounce while looking out of the back of my car, and G did the same from the car behind.  It stayed stationary in the middle of the street, and just continued to bounce up and down a few more times until retreating back into the sky.  But the bouncing wasn't conventional at all, it forcefully sped up in both directions, almost as if it was accelerating back and forth in it's twenty foot span. 
 
We turned around because I was convinced that it was a basketball or something explainable.  There were no people, no basketballs, no dead animals, no sign of anything.  I checked the mirror.  There was no actual damage at all.  The mirror popped right back into place and the only evidence of it at all was a horizontal white line on the back of the mirror itself, which would, I assume, be the contact point.  The line had an almost powdery consistency to it, and upon touching it, it just sort of vanished.  It came off much like salt would come off of something - sort of vaporized into the air.  It didn't smell, it didn't leave any residue on my hands, nothing.  It just went away.

Reddit, meet my father or his rather bald head to be precise. 
Since moving into their new house about 5 years ago oddly spooky things have happened. 

Note: My father doesn't believe in ghosts or life after death.

Here's the story thus far, since moving into the house there appears to be a presence of some kind. It started maybe two years ago when my father was working in the living room, he heard a voice ask if he was working there. His response was ""no, I live here, do you?"" to which the voice answered ""Yes, I live in the basement"".
Fast forward a year, a my mother comes home from work asking my dad (while he was working in the kitchen) how his day was to which he responded... a couple of minutes later someone asked him how his day was again and him turning around to inform my mother he had just told her found nobody in the room.
At Christmas my aunt and mothers best friend visited, when walking into the bedroom my aunt saw a figure leaning over the bed and my mothers friend saw an old lady at the bottom of the bed. 
Events have turned more interesting in the last few months, our friendly ghost is now moving objects, in the video where the picture frame moves, there is a collection of DVD's just out of sight. These were all moved and nicely arranged on the kitchen table over night, my mother unable to find the culprit in my brothers assumed someone was sleep walking. She has also been speaking more often, the reason my father recorded this video was that she spoke and he tried to catch it on camera. He thought she had said ""I can't find him"" after analyzing the situation though where she continues to move things in that area of the house we've decided that she said ""I can't find it"". 
Since the recording of this video (a couple of weeks ago, I'm new to reddit though so you get it late) the DVD's have all moved again and now we have a new trick of pictures being turned on the walls of the house and the photos on the shelf being rearranged:

I particularly found this fascinating, I've never known someone with a genuine experience of ghosts. The next time I go back to England I intend to see if I can experience anything first hand. Thought it was worth sharing our story.

Since all this happened I've asked my dad what his thoughts are now on death and his answer was ""don't know"", he has a way with words.

I am VERY interested in anything anyone has to say about it.  I don't know what to make of it.

As I write this my daughter is 4 years old.  She is the sweetest, most special person in my life.  I love her mother dearly, but I don't think anything in my life compares to how I feel about my daughter.

I am 40 years old, My daughter was born when I was 36.  I have suffered from depression all of my life.  I can easily point to signs of my depression when I was 12 or 14 years old.
When I was 30 I finally hit rock bottom.  I went to a shrink, I got on medication and I told him that the only solution that I had left was the only solution that I was sure would work.  I told him I didn't want to do that, but I was out of ideas.

That was a decade ago.  I wish I did at 20 what I did at 30.

The thing about depression, it is a struggle.  I am not sold that I will ever be without it.  I am merely healthier then I was, I will never be cured.
You don't take an SSRI and suddenly your life is full of kittens.  You take an SSRI and try to figure out how to fix the shithouse you have created.  The SSRI's enable you to take control of your life, they don't really fix anything.

As such, even seeing the shrink, even being on medication there are ups and downs.

And during that time between 30 and 36 (probably 32'ish, I don't remember my wife in the picture) I went through a terrible and deep depression.

It was awful.  It drug on for months.  It simply didn't get better.  Thing was, even before the depression I was beat.  It takes a lot out of someone to live a life like that.  I had nothing left of me.
As the depression got worse and worse, I got closer and closer to suicide.

Till it finally bottomed out.
And I was suicidal.  I knew how to do it.  I just needed peace with myself about who I was going to hurt.

That night I had a dream.

Let me regress.  I don't remember my dreams.  I am certain I dreamed last night.  I am sure it was terrific.  I don't remember it at all.  In fact, I have had this annoying habit over my life to only remember dreams that were important.

Every once in a while I would have this weird ass dream, a few days later I would still be clinging onto it and I would set it aside.  They are weird.  They often foreshadowed things in my life.  Sometimes they were dead on accurate.
But with any constitancy they are the only dreams I remember 3 days later.

So back to the depression.  I had this dream.  In this dream my mother was standing in her kitchen holding my daughter and telling me I am a terrific Father.
The very next day my depression lifted.
Just went away that next morning.
*poof*

Sometime goes by, my daughter is born, and almost immediatly I remember the dream.  When she was so young I used to look at her and wonder if we had met before.

My Mother has held her in her kitchen and said I was a good Dad.

I don't know what else to say.  

To this day I still deal with depression.  My Dad died last Fall.  My Daughter is the cure all.

The floor in the attic is raised, beneath is all the insulation. We started clearing out insulation and found some old things that had to be from owners long long ago. Tiny white children's shoes, cutlery, pantyhose, and a few sticks wrapped with string. It wasn't the first time we'd found old things.


Previously, when we were putting the pool in the backyard, we found a large ash line in the dirt. In that ash line (which we assume is a burnt down shed) we dug up faucets, spoons, knives, and most surprisingly-- a silver revolver. We kept these items for a couple years on display (I wish I had pictures) but they disappeared about 2006/2007. I've tried to find them but nobody in my house (about 4 other people) have any idea where they went. 


A few weeks after finishing up the attic the dogs start acting strange. We have a beagle and dachshund. The dachshund will start barking while staring up at walls like someone is standing there. Our beagle wakes up at 3am and runs around the house barking like a maniac and nobody can calm him down or keep him quiet. Both of our dogs have starting sitting and barking in this ONE area of the front hallway and won't leave. The beagle, who usually sleeps in one of the bedrooms, now ONLY sleeps in this area. It's like he's standing guard?


One night, a family member of mine is sleeping in his room with the door open (located directly across from this hallway). He told me he woke up because our beagle was sitting there growling and facing his doorway. When he sat up to look at the dog, he heard what sounded like an older woman scream ""Heeeeelp."" I've never seen him so scared! He insists he heard a woman's voice yell this. 


The next day, another member is in the shower (and she's a FIRM non-believer and will explain away anything and everything) when she hears a knock on the bathroom door. She yells out, ""Hello? I'm in here!"" and nobody responds. When she finishes she goes downstairs and asks if anyone knocked on the door. The only other person in the house said he was way in the basement grabbing laundry... She claims it was the dogs, but we all know a dog doesn't *knock* high on the door they scratch at the bottom of the door. She wouldn't yell hello if the dog ""knocked"" on the door.


Two nights ago, I was lying in my bedroom which is located above the dining room. My bed is thick, with a memory foam top, a mattress pad, and a ton of pillows... but no matter what I do I hear what sounds like somebody in the dining room. Walking around, moving stuff, and the distinct noise of a cabinet opening and closing over and over. It's driving me crazy and I'm a little frightened so I crank up the television and go to sleep. 


About 3am that night, my beagle (who I managed to rope into sleeping with me) wakes up and runs to my bedroom door. He starts whining and scratching until I get up and let him out. He runs down the stairs and I hear him growling in the dining room below... needless to say I hurried back to the safety of my bed.


LAST night was the icing on the cake. Me and one other member are the only people in the house. We're watching TV and have it on mute during some commercials. We're talking to each other about how we've been hearing strange noises at all hours of the day and night. As we're talking the dachshund starts barking uncontrollably at the front hallway (per usual). I go over to her and she's looking up, barking away. I tell her to knock it off but she won't stop. I look in the bedroom to the left and the beagle is on the bed, looking out to the hallway, with all his hair on edge. I angrily put them outside as they're barking was overpowering the TV. I got back to the living room.


At another commercial break we muted the TV. This time, as soon as it's muted, we hear a loud BANG in the front hall. Looking at each other to confirm we both heard it, we stay quiet and listen close. Another bang follows... and then the distinct sound of heels on a wood floor as it gets louder like it's nearing us in the living room. We're both really nervous and laughing/crying looking at each other. I get up to walk over to the hallway to see if maybe someone just got home and I walk straight into a wall of ice.


Literally, my right calf is frozen. Goosebumps and a chill spread up my leg, my side, and to my right arm. 


I run over and put my hands on the other person and I'm yelling, ""Holy shit I'm freezing on one side of my body!! Look, there are goosebumps ALL over this side of me. Feel my hands! My left is hot, my right is like ice!"" He stares at me and you can tell he's really freaked out. I'm honestly pretty giddy about it at this point, as it doesn't scare me as much as excites me. Did I just walk into something or someone? 


Is there any way to calm our house's activity? What do you guys think? I just wanted to share whats been going on with the reddit community! r/paranormal seemed right. 


Thanks for reading.



**//UPDATE:**

I'm drawing connections and I'm thinking whatever it is is female, likely on the older side... it's literally giving me chills thinking about it. Maybe linked to my being a retarded teenager and playing with a Ouija and having seances?? I'm thinking it's more from disturbing the attic... who knows. 


My town library closes before I get out of work so I'll have to go Saturday morning to do research on the house! Internet searching is not working out. 


Tonight I will attempt an EVP session and leave a recorder out. I'll also take pictures of the active areas. I'll update soon! Thanks for all the help, redditors. Much appreciated. 


**UPDATE 2:**

Sorry, don't have the voice recorder tonight to do an EVP session. It was lent out to someone but I'll have it by  Saturday (also the day I will be digging for old info on the house at the library/historical society).

Eventually we started leaving audio recorders to try and capture EVPs. We caught a few of those, but nothing amazing. 

Then one day, right after setting up the recorder in the attic, we heard a disembodied voice. It was the sound of an old man singing and the recorder caught it. The words are a bit slurred and I'm not sure what he is saying in parts of it, but it's loud and clear and I've always wanted to share it with the world. I'm just not sure where to do it.

For Christmas, this year, we bought her a coffee maker, but never gave it to her because she was in too bad of shape to acknowledge it.. Last night I was standing in my room, watching television, when all of a sudden my closet door sounded like it was about to be kicked down from the inside, Insane pounding and knob jiggling, then it opens slightly on its own. I'm at this point scared to death. I sat down and went to sleep after my adrenaline rush stopped. Fast forward to this morning.. my mom opened my grandmas two gifts and used the coffee maker.. Im chilling in my room looking down the hall and I see our hall chandelier start to sway on its own. I tell my mom and she sees. I get up and make breakfast and all of that.. then I go back to my room. I'm standing in my room and I hear the glass and metal light fixture shake. If shakes violently for a few seconds.I go and tell my mom, and go back to the room.. fast forward to noon. Im crouching and looking for something under my couch.. I hear the light move again and stand and step over to the wall to flip on another light. When I do, the entire fixture falls out of the ceiling and lands right where I was crouching. I fucking bolt out to go find my mom. Shortly after I find her, her phone starts ringing from her moms number (grandma on my dads side passed). She picks up and noones there. This happens like four times. She calls her mom to find out Wtf is going on, just to find out that she never called her, in fact, her phone had been ringing from my moms number the entire time..... I am scared shitless and don't know what to do .. any advice or info/input guys? Please please help.

I've had done experiences with what I and other redditors suspect are shadow people in my new apartment, but this just happened in the last hour and I think this crossed the creepy line. 

As I've said before my girlfriend works in the morning leaving the apartment for myself for quite a while. So I was taking a shower and getting ready for work when I heard the front door open then close, and then my girlfriend calling my name, ""Was it a slow day babe?"" I asked, no response, maybe she didn't hear me ""Babe?"" I asked again, still no answer. I paid no attention maybe she went at it with a customer or a co-worker and went straight to the bedroom. 

I finished with my shower and walked in the bedroom and to my surprise, you guessed it, no girlfriend there, I looked around the apartment and she was nowhere to be found, no keys, no purse, nothing. I've heard that if you ask a spirit to leave they will so that seemed like a good idea ""Whatever or whoever you are, you're not welcome, we live here now, please leave."" good thing I was by myself because I probably looked crazy talking to no one. Silence, I thought it worked, no doors flew open, no crazy-looking lady came from under the bed, but then I heard it as clear as if whoever said it was next to me, ""NO."" I was scared shitless, I got dressed and went straight to work. I already called my girlfriend and told her not to go home after work. She knows what has been happening so she didn't questioned me any further. 

We are staying at a motel tonight. If someone can offer any help is more than welcome. I don't know what to do anymore.

There's this weird sort of entitlement that some people carry, as if their personal set of beliefs is the yardstick by which others must validate their experiences on demand. Skepticism is perfectly reasonable, I tend to be pretty skeptical, but the Skeptic with a capitol S pseudo-religion is starting to get pretty irritating.

So about 6 month's ago my wife, sister, and I had an experience in our house like no other. I didn't see anything but I was there to witness their reactions to what happend. I posted it to a paranormal site, before I joined reddit.

I wanna post it on here and as well a link. 

So I had something weird happend at my house last saturday or sunday night... First off.. My Wife is somewhat of a medium. She see's spirits, orbs, and shadow people all the time, so she is used to this kind of thing... Except she never gets this excited about seeing something. Me on the other hand, I don't ever see anything. All I've seen was an orb that lit our bedroom up one time and that was enough for me.

So anyways, my sister, wife, and I were all sitting in the living room just hanging out. They were both on the couch watching tv while I was beside it on my computer playing a game. Now, the computer desk is next to our entertainment center, which I cannot see what's on the tv unless I move the computer chair back a bit. The placement is important, so with that said... I decided to get up and go the kitchen to grab a drink.(the kitchen is directly behind me from the living room) As I was doing whatever I was doing when I heard my wife and sister asking themselves outloud, ""Why did he do that?"" I then leaned over the counter in the kitchen and asked them what they were doing. They didn't see me initially and asked how I threw my voice from the hallway into the kitchen. At that moment my sister got up and walked down the hallway, which is on the opposite side of the kitchen. After she saw that I wasn't really in the hallway both of them ran into the kitchen and kept asking me if I went down the hall over and over, which I kept saying no while laughing. They then told me that they both saw me get up and ""scurry"" down the hallway before turning around and giving them a silly face... It had the same clothes, facial features, hair, everything. I told them that was impossible because I went straight to the kitchen. The more I kept telling them I didn't go down the hallway the more freaked out they looked.

My wife thinks it is my father who passed away when I was around 3 years old. I am almost a spitting image of him too. Funny thing is he died when he was only 27 from throat cancer and I just turned 27 this year in May.. My close friend thinks it is my doppleganger... That Monday after this happend my grandmother called me to tell my that my Pappa, grandpa, has liver cancer.......Dopplegangers showing themselves are a mark of bad luck and misfortune. 

What do you guys think? Was I being informed of my grandpa? Does my Father have something to tell me? Or can two people that saw the EXACT same thing just be wrong??

I had woken up in the middle of the night, 2AM-ish I think? Because I had one of those dreams where you realise you need to take a piss in the dream, so I got up to go to the bathroom. 
I went in did my business, and next to the sink is a rectangular mirror. As I turned around, I saw a flash of someone I thought was my Nain (grandmother for you non-welsh redditors) who has been dead for 9 years. The shock made me spin around, catch my foot on the foot of the bath, and fall. I think I hit my head on the way down.
Now, to clarify, the bathroom of my house was the guest room when my Nain owned the house before she passed.
When I (what I thought) came to, I was really confused. My head didn't hurt, but I had a sort of ache at the base of my skull. As I got off the floor, I realised it was daylight, so figured I had my hit my head and stayed there the rest of the night. I turned to leave, and saw that I was in the guestroom, the way it used to be. As I stood there, my Nain walked into the room, followed by a young boy, who I realised was me, I must have 5, maybe 6? My Nain told young-me that the puzzles were in the wardrobe, which is where the sink would have been.
Young-me got a puzzle out of the wardrobe, and ran out. As my Nain was leaving the room, she stood still, and turned round, and then walked towards me? I thought that there must have been something behind me, but she made eye contact, and kept walking, and started to cry. At this point I'm crying too, as any person who knows their grandparents will understand the pain of seeing them sad.
She got to me, put either hand on the sides of my face, and she hugged me. I can still smell her perfume, the feel of her oversized glasses pressed against the side of my face, and just the feeling of her sobbing into my shoulder. I asked her what was wrong, and she told me that she wasnt supposed to see me yet, and that I needed to wake up. I asked her what she meant, and she wiped the tears away from my face, told me that she would see me again, and then my Taid (grandfather) walked into the room, and told me I still had to try to be a man (when I was alot younger, I would always ask him ""Am I a man now""? after accomplishing milestone things, like tying my shoelaces, riding a bike, etc, and he always told me that I still needed to try and be a man). 
At this point, he shook my hand, told me my Nain was right, and that I needed to wake up. I told them I didnt know what they meant by I needed to wake up, and then they hugged me together told me that I would always be their special boy, and turned to leave. I asked them not to go, but they kept walking, and I couldnt move. My voice started sounding really faint, and then I heard a really weird rushing sound in my ears, like it was really windy? 
Next thing I knew, I was being shaken by my mum, telling me to wake up, and that the ambulance was on it's way.
I know this all sounds really far fetched, but please only post if you have an explanation or a similar experience.

I could use some opinion on what happened.,Phantomsgf,96,32,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1bwc2x/my_baby_neice_just_scared_the_hell_out_of_me_i/,"Ok, so background information: my mom and I have always been very sensitive to energies and such, even having matching feelings or sights of spirits or premonitions. Somehow, through the years, I grew a little bit scared of it all and preferred to take on a more skeptical approach to most things. But what happened today really scared the hell out of me.

My niece is just 13 months old, she is only learning to try and say a few words and the one she can pronounce better is ""hello"" , said in a sort of ""hewou"". I've been looking after her for a couple of months because my sister is having to travel a lot. So she started calling me ""Ma"", confusing me with her real mom.

Today, my mother and me where playing with her while she was sitting on the bed. We would say hello to her, and she'd say ""hewou"" back. 
At a certain point, I turned over to my mom and said that I thought it was very cute that her first word was ""hello"".

All of a sudden my baby niece says : ""Hello phantomsgf"" (my real name obviously) perfectly pronounced and in her little baby voice.

I couldn't believe what I had just heard. I looked at my mom and she was just as shocked. We looked back at the baby and she just turned back to play with her plush while she giggled. I instantly felt sick and terrified, my mom felt it as well.

She didn't do any other weird thing after that and went back to saying ""hewou"" and calling me ""Ma"".

1363809820.0,62,self.Paranormal,1aomxi,Tabloids predicted three events that came true in 1996.,vampedvixen,79,17,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1aomxi/tabloids_predicted_three_events_that_came_true_in/,"Back in 1996, when I was fourteen years old, I wandered into the local stationary/candy/general store by my house. I started browsing the magazines (because back then I never actually bought anything, I just read it in the store like a delinquent). I was into ghost stories/paranormal shit back then so I picked up some tabloid. It was one of those newspapers where the cover story is usually something like ""Woman in Newark Gives Birth To BatBoy (Exclusive Photos Inside!)""

It must have been around the end of the year/beginning of 1996, because the cover story was a list of predictions that were going to take place that year. It showed a map of the United States and blubs that pointed to where major stories would take place. There were a bunch, but three of them jumped out at me: a blizzard in the mid-atlantic/New England area, a bombing at the Olympics in Athens, Georgia, and a plane crash in the Atlantic Ocean near Long Island. I put the magazine away, bought some candy and put it out of my mind for the time being because as much as I was into the paranormal, I didn't really buy into any real predictions like that.

There was a Blizzard in February of 1996, which was the largest snowstorm in NYC history. Something felt off about it, like there was something I was supposed to remember about it, but I was more focused on the fact that school was canceled for a week and a half. Being fourteen at the time, the fact that the world was covered in snow and the multitude of snowdays given to us took precedence in my thoughts.

Then on July 17, 1996 there was a plane crash off of Long Island. TWA Flight 800. It happened pretty close to where I lived at the time and it was a pretty big crashed (killed 230 people), so it was all over the local news. It suddenly became very clear what was going on. My best friend, Veronica, called me that day and we were chatting on the phone about random shit and then the conversation turned to the news. I took a chance at her calling me crazy and told her at that point what I had read a few months earlier. I told her that the blizzard was the first sign I missed and that there would be a bombing at the Olympics as well. We didn’t know what to make of the weird circumstances but decided to wait and see what happened during the summer games.

Even today, I feel a bit guilty about Flight 800. There’s a big memorial set up at Smith Point County Park Beach, with a list of all the people who died that day. I’ve been to it several times. It’s so eerie walking around there, wondering if I could have done something to prevent it. I was just a kid then though, and I didn’t have much to go on (a blizzard in New England during winter? What are the odds? rolls eyes). I’ve been told since then that there were probably several people who read that same tabloid and were in a better position to do something, but it’s still kind of haunting even now.

I remember watching the parade of nations coming in on opening day during the 1996 Olympic Games. It was this weird feeling of dread, because I knew what was going to happen and I felt like I was watching people walking to their doom. I had no idea how big the attack would be but it was really weird to sit there and watch everyone walk in cheering and to just know in the pit of my stomach that things were going to go horribly wrong. I sat there and prayed everyone would make it out of the situation alive, because there was just so little I could do.

About a week into the games, I got the news—there was indeed a bombing at Centennial Olympic Park—two people died, eleven were injured. I got a call that day from Veronica. She asked me if I saw it, and I was sitting in front of the television, watching the news coverage and told her that yeah, I saw it, and yeah, I knew it would happen. She asked me again how I knew and I told her that all I knew was that I read it somewhere.

Since that day, I’ve tried to go back through the Sun, National Enquirer and any other tabloid-ish magazines I could think of that the stationary store would have stocked. I can’t find that many back copies though, so I haven’t found much of anything in the past decade and a half. I haven’t told many people about this because it was just too weird. I don’t have many explanations for what happened. The only rational way I can explain it (other than the wild idea that these tabloids really do have psychics working for them, oohhh hocus pocus, and all that jazz) might be that since these things were man-made disasters (other than the giant blizzard, but like I said before that wouldn't be too hard to guess) that someone might have caught wind of people high up plotting them, tried to go to the regular newspapers and was written off as a conspiracist and the only newspaper they were able to use to tell the world were these tabloids.

I did have a shrink once who my parents forced me to go to because I was having physical problems the doctors all thought were caused by stress (found out later that I had cuts all through my intestines, I wasn't lying and it wasn't stress, but that’s not important). The shrink was a bit of a Jesus-freak and I’m not sure how he got a counseling license, but I told him about it because the anniversary of Flight 800 was coming up and it was on the news. He got this wary look in his eyes like ‘oh, she’s reeeeally crazy, I’m gonna have to prescribe LOTS of pills for her’ and asked me “So, you think you can see the future, then?” Apparently the belief that one can see the future can be attributed to so many different mental illnesses. I just rolled my eyes at him, because he clearly hadn't been listening to me at all. “No. I don’t think I can see the future. I think I can read.”

I split my time working at various homes and spend a day or so a week at this one particular home. I never noticed anything strange working there.

I have a patient who has various psychiatric disorders (MR, schizoaffective) anyway, she seems to sometimes switch over to different personas (I heard her be a man once), she usually blames bad behavior on ""that"" guy. So, since I'd say I work with the psych population, this isn't that strange to me.

Anyway, I had a conversation with staff yesterday about it (and how it could be kind of creepy) especially since I'm open- minded to this kind of stuff. The staffmember spoke to me about how the house used to emit off bad vibes (not at least since I've been there)-- staff didn't like going in there alone (house is empty during the day). One day a staff member heard a breathing (similar to the exorcist) and male grunting sounds from the 3rd floor, while one of our higher functioning patients was home for the day. When the staffmember said she gathered enough courage to see what was going on, she seen our patient and asked her how she was, the patient said ""I'm fine"" in her happy girly voice. The staffmember said that she was afraid of this patient ever since.

I'll start. I've had a few occurrences in my life time that I cannot explain away. My uncle (mothers brother) passed away before I was born. It has always been a disscussion within my family that he is ""watching over us."" WHen I was younger, I was minding my own business playing with my Sega Genesis in our play room when I noticed a man sitting Indian style behind me. I remember telling this person to leave me alone. when he didn't, i freaked and ran to tell my mother about this man. she followed me back into the room and showed me that one was there. she was right. I proceeded to complete the Chemical Zone in sonic when I noticed him again, this time he was standing slightly to the left of the doorway, still watching me. I ran, again, to my mother. According to her I described the man (personally I only remember the purple silhouette of a man)as exactly as she remembers he brother. SHe told me who it may be and it put me somewhat at ease, I never saw him again.
ANother account is from my father, one day he was putting my brother and I back in our car seats, after a meal at Taco Bell. My brother was first (as he was younger) and then myself. When he went to put me in my brother was gone (a matter of maybe a minute apart. My brother had let himself out of the seat and was walking in the parking lot. my father noticed and grabbed him second before a van hit him. Needless to say my father was shaken up. The next morning he was putting us in the car again to pick up my mother at the airport from wherever she had been. As he was putting me in my car seat, my father noticed a pair of mens legs sitting between my brother and I. He stood up straight and saw no one in the car. he then turned his head toward the driveway and claims he saw the back of a man in a white shirt, with cut off jeans and blonde hair walking away. He went to call out to him and he disappeared before my fathers eyes.
My mothers brother died in 1986 or '87 and was a true hippie at heart, his favorite shirt was a white Budweiser shirt. He had medium length blonde hair. He was a druggie and died of an overdose. still to this day I have strange things like this happen to me and always explain it away as uncle Scottie checking up on me.

My oldest memory is as follows: I am present in an ever stretching landscape, it feels like I am amidst a long stretch of sandy dunes, however sand isn't quite the substance surrounding me - it seemed morelike dust, though heavy silvery-golden dust, and many many hills of this dust stretched into the distance. I have no feeling of body, a feeling of sound and site, no means to express myself physically. I am drawn forward at a fast speed, though feel absolutely no pressure of air or feeling of movement. This continuous drag continues for a few minutes, though the landscape never changes much - only the physical size of the dunes seems to go up and down like regular dunes. In the distance I am approaching an old greek style building, slowing down to a smooth glide at the speed of normal walking. The building itself appears to be a temple, quite wide though only 20 feet high. The roof is supported by what seems to be marble pillars that are directly connected to a roof of the same substance, and a floor with steps of the same substance. Adorning the walls are majestic picture frames containing swirls of worldly colour - the 'pictures' are recognizable to me at this time, though I have no idea what they are anymore and cannot begin to describe them, they just 'are'.

As I begin to 'climb' the steps toward these pictures, I notice an older man to my left. He looks both old as ever, but young as can be - this is an odd feeling to describe though - he appears both old and young. He is around 6""0 tall, has a short grey caesarian style haircut accompanying a short, neatly trimmed grayish beard. He is wearing a robe seemingly made of golden white silk, with a golden strap across one shoulder, the other exposed. He is of muscular form. He looks at me, smiles, nods towards me and raises his hand to the paintings ahead of us, smiles once again and I feel overly joyed. I feel myself move closer towards the pictures, to the point that I'm staring into this mass of contorting colors with extreme joy and excitement. I feel myself move into the picture, and my next memory is of my childhood bedroom.

It's just...something I want to get off my chest, I suppose. It's paranormal, though, so I'm hoping it fits within this subreddit. If it doesn't, please feel free to delete it! (Though I'd appreciate it too if anyone could tell me which subreddit would be appropriate then.)

Like many people in my country, I live with my extended family. Sometimes this means ten people. Sometimes it means seven. Sometimes as few as three. My extended family, back then, consisted of my grandparents on dad's side, my aunt, and my uncle. As far as I can remember, we always sat together eating dinner under his particular tree in front of our house. It isn't a well-lit area by any means, like most country homes in those days, and if we forgot to bring lamps it was normal to sit in whatever dim light we could get from our house, talk, and look at the stars. This was way before the internet, bookstores were rare and we never liked TV that much, so that's what we did for most of our evenings. 

By the time I went to college, though, most of these evening rituals were gone. TV and the internet had replaced it, and the cities are lit at night, so there's nightlife to go to, as well. Only my grandparents still kept to the ritual. So I wasn't surprised to see my grandfather sitting under the tree one day, when I came back in one of my few returns from college, and he waved me over. It was very dark, but I'd recognize my grandfather anywhere, and I knew it was him. I felt nostalgic, so I went and sat there with him, just like old times. He asked me how I was doing, how I was enjoying college, if I'm happy with what I intend to do in the future. He asked a lot of things, and was unusually lucid, unusually kind. Like most people his age, he was usually senile and crabby at that point. But that day he was like the gentle granddad I grew up with.

I did notice that there wasn't any lights on in the house, though, so I asked him what happened. He seemed suddenly uncomfortable and said that everyone went to some sort of event, and now he's the only one to watch the house. I offer that we should go upstairs and I'll help him watch the house and open it up, but he said no, I most definitely should stay there and talked to him more. He was stubborn, so I complied.

It was around an hour later that my family came back, and I went to get them at the door. I apologized for not telling them I was coming because my cell phone was out of battery and I'd lost the charger, and they chided me for sitting out there alone in the dark. I was annoyed, so I shot back that I was just talking with granddad so I was fine, and that *they* should be ashamed for leaving an old man alone to watch the house!

My parents were surprised and my aunt gasped. They just went to granddad's funeral.

I thought they were kidding with me so I turned back, but granddad was no longer there. The house was quiet. There was no sign of anyone ever sitting under that tree except me. 

He died earlier that morning, apparently, and I wasn't told because my family couldn't contact me. (By custom, the 'main' part of our funerals lasts a week and it'd start on the very day someone dies.) I still maintain that I really did spent an hour talking to him, and the only explanation I can offer is that he was worried about me being home alone (this isn't a very safe country, especially if you're a girl) and that he wanted to talk to me one last time, since I was the only one he didn't get to say goodbye to. I'm a scientist and a skeptic when it comes to these things, but there.....really isn't any other explanation I can think of. A home invader/creeper pretending to be grandpa is out of the question. I would *know*.

Love you too, grandpa. Hope you're happy in your next life, or wherever you're now. We're still happy where we are, too. And I hope you don't mind me posting this. I just want to let other people know. Sometimes people die and you can only grieve.

They didn't own a car so my grandpa always took shortcuts in the fields instead of using the road. So one day, he left (around 3-4am still dark) to work and on everything normal as usual until he crossed a river. From then on, he saw a chicken following him, and each time he world look back, it would change into another animal. He told me it changed to a dog, snake, rat, raccoon, etc. It followed him until he reached the end of the dirt road. When he looked back, it had turned into a black figure (it was visible, the sun was rising) that was also following him. Then he just ran it and never looked back. Since then, he still doesn't know what it was. Any thoughts? Sorry if i misspelled anything.
**EDIT**: i just talked about it again with my dad and he said that it happened twice to my grandpa. this was the 1st time. The 2nd time this happened, he was aware and started walking faster. In the end the animals were turning into his children and calling out for him to play with them. This creeped the shit outa him and never used that road again.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1360897771.0,,,True,t3_18jspm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18jspm/is_this_true/,

That night I had a dream where he came to me. I knew I was dreaming and I could change our surroundings but he was always with me. I asked him why and he told me he wanted to let me know he was ok and that I shouldn't be worried. When I woke up I knew that he was gone and 3 days later they found his body.

Lets say I was glad that one day of training was all I needed to say that I didn't want to work at this particular hotel.

I used to work in the hotel industry and left the profession for a year due to my course at university getting quite difficult for a couple of semesters. I came back into it looking to do some part time work manning the front desk on friday and saturday nights (Night Audit). A few things of how the hotel was built was that there was a car park level directly above the reception and main entrance area. Guests could only access it after calling the front desk and you would have to manually walk through the carpark to open the gated entrance. Nobody else had access to it except people at the front desk.

I was going through the whole on the job training when the receptionist who was training me told me some stories about the hotel including all the suicides they've had. What he told me was that on his watch he has had three suicides of where people have jumped off the balcony or fallen off and landed in the car park area. What I can't forget and has stuck to me is how he described the noise of them landing in the car park level. He said it sounded like a bomb had gone off and the whole reception area would shake for a couple of seconds.

He then told me about the incidents of staff (especially porters) seeing shadows and people in their rear view mirror when moving the cars around to make more room for other cars. There was one story where someone who had newly started working at the hotel and was called on by a guest to grab something out of the car for him to bring up to his room. He had only gone up to the car park level for a couple of minutes when other staff (house keeping) heard screaming coming from that level and someone running down the stairwell and trying to frantically open the door into the main foyer. Luckily there weren't any guests checking in at that very moment and he had collapsed on the floor screaming that he saw someone walk up to the car and peer into the window while he was searching for what ever the guest had asked him to grab.

We decided to go to the Stanley Hotel and reserved RM 401 for the weekend of Halloween a couple of years ago.  When we arrived at the hotel I was amazed at how gorgeous it was!  The hubby and I went straight to the room so that I could finally see what all the fuss was about (the other room that is significant here is RM 217).  The room itself is rather small; with all the furniture they stuff in there you barely have room to keep your luggage out.  I was sitting on the bed and we started to hear a group of people walking down the hall outside the door.  It was one of the tour groups.  The group stopped right outside the door and we could clearly hear the tour guide talk about the history of the room to the group, then the door knob started to move!  I looked at my husband to make sure that he saw that someone was coming in the room!?  Just then he grabs the door knob and opens the door, since I was sitting on the bed right by the door I could clearly see the tour guide was right there  but he had his back to the door, he was not the one turning the door knob...  Of course everyone in the group kind of flinched with us opening the door and the guide apologized for being there, he stated ""the front desk didn't say anyone checked in yet"".  I was sitting on the bed still thinking to myself ""I saw that knob move, but the guide wasn’t doing it, who was"".  We didn't talk about it after it happened, we actually left the hotel and went in town for a couple of hours.  The next night we were sitting on the couch out on the enclosed porch off the room.  We had closed the glass door that separates the room from the porch.  I said to my husband ""I can't believe we will be here for two nights and nothing is going to happen"".  At this exact moment the door swings open between the porch and the room!  My husband and I look at each other and he says ""well that’s done"".  Guess the ghost didn't want us to wait any longer either...

It's been on my blog ""From the Outer II"" and is an account from someone very close to me.  I thought I would put it on here to get any opinions. I apologize in advance for using W as a name.

This story was the result of a friendship that had grown to the point where we felt safe telling each other some impossible things that had happened to us.  I recently asked this friend if I could actually interview him about the story for this blog.  It was agreed that I would do it if I kept him anonymous.  So, for the duration of this article I will simply refer to him as W.

This story is about when W had an encounter with what he thought was a supernatural being.  It was a hostile physical form that appeared in his bedroom and disappeared without there being any way in and out.  The entity also appeared to control time and did not like light either.  He later found out he was not the only one to see this entity.  A friend of his also encountered it in a different location.  Sounds like a possible malevolent apparition right?

The catch to this story is that W’s description matches typical Gray alien descriptions.

This was when W was still a teenager.  He cannot remember the year, but does remember that it was summertime and the day before his family reunion.  It was probably the third of July.

W had just gotten into a serious argument with his father.  Fuming, W went into his bedroom and shut the door.  He suddenly felt an instant uneasiness that he could not explain.  It was early evening so the room was dark, but it wasn’t completely pitch black.

Frustrated from the fight, W plopped down on the bed.  He then reached over to turn the bedside light on.  The lamp didn’t work; and as he fiddled with it, he looked under the table and saw it had been unplugged.  From the bed, W couldn’t reach the cord in order to pug it back in.

W looked over to his closet and saw a strange face amongst his other stuff.  Thinking he must be imagining things, M closed his eyes.  When he opened them again the face was still there.  He described it as oval shaped and with huge black eyes.  The nose was simply a set of slits.  The mouth was small.

To remove any doubt in W’s mind; the eyes blinked.  There were no visible eyelids beforehand and they disappeared afterwards.

W officially freaked out.  From this moment on, W talks of time skipping and coming to almost a halt.  Even immediately after the incident, he noticed gaps in his memory.

As soon as he saw the eyes blink, W was on his feet and heading for the door.  He doesn’t remember actually getting out of bed.  W does remember the door being locked.  He described his body as being both paralyzed and moving on its own.  His head turned and his eyes half glanced over his shoulder.

The being was standing behind W while reaching out towards him.  It was about four and a half feet tall.  The entire body was thin.  The appendages seemed to be normal length for its height.

During this particular part of the account, W said that time stopped around him, even though the entity and him were moving.

Suddenly, W was aware of himself running out the front door and screaming.  There was no recollection of the time in between.  W would have had to somehow gain control of his body, unlock his bedroom door, escape the being’s touch, and run through the house.  There is no memory of any of it.

W was shaken to the core.  After telling his mother what happened, she checked the room and found nothing.  W still refused to go in that room and even moved into his sister’s room the next day.  He had spent a rough lightless night on the couch petrified that the being was going to come get him again.

Two details did manage to get filled in later.  W didn’t remember screaming while in the bedroom.  His mother informed him that he began screaming from almost the time he went in.  Also, the parts that weren’t missing in W’s mind took up about a half hour according to him.  His mother said he was only in the bedroom for two to five minutes.

That would have been just enough time to see the cord unplugged.

W wasn’t the only one to see this entity either.  Unbeknownst to him, among W’s friends there was the knowledge that one of them not only encountered an entity of the same description, but claimed to have punched it in the face.  It was not until years later that W divulged his story and found that his friend had already told three more of their friends about his encounter.

Among supposed extraterrestrial encounters, it is not uncommon for a group of friends to have similar experiences.  Sometimes abductees find each other without ever knowing each other beforehand (or realizing they knew from their experiences).  In demonic accounts; the spirit focuses on one person, but will terrorize that person’s family as well.  Malevolent infestations have even been known to travel great distances just to attack anyone that knows of that person’s plight or tries to help.

The biggest clue of all is the piece of this story that isn‘t heard much in alien reports, but fits highly well in the malevolent spirit theory; W already felt uneasy before having any clue of this being hiding or appearing in his room.

Also, I took the liberty of asking him if the entity felt reptilian like or insect like.  His answer was neither.  This isn’t an end all proof, but I personally found it interesting.

This is not to say that there are not Grays coming out of obviously mechanical vehicles.  This was also only five miles away from Tuckahoe State Park in Maryland, and the forest there might have hid something during that time.

Still, it seems this report has multiple possible explanations.

I also asked W if there had been any other strange stuff happening during that time since multiple phenomena tend to hit within a relatively short time.  The answer was no, but I was only asking one person in that area.

My wife was about 8 and they lived there until she was 14 I believe. My wife, Suzy, has and older sister (5 years older) and an older brother (2 years older). The street they lived on was called Indian Trail and, supposedly, was named as such because there used to be a Native American presence in the area.

Anyway, the story that freaked me out the most had to do with her brother. He couldn't find his house keys one day, and looked everywhere for them. He said he tore his room apart, went outside and looked on the lawn, and just couldn't find his keys. So he finally gives up, goes into his room and kicks off his shoes, and goes to the restroom. He comes back from the restroom and goes to put his clothes away and there are his keys... sitting in his right shoe. He was the only one home because he had early release from school and he had only been out of the room for about 5 minutes.

They also talk a lot about how their mom called the cops on multiple occasions after they first moved in because the was **convinced** that there was someone in their attic/walking around on their roof and talking to eachother. Every time, nobody would be found, even though the footsteps would continue until within minutes of the police arriving. The cops were also called by my wife when she was 10 because she was downstairs when she heard a massive **crash!** sound come from her room upstairs. She was convinced someone had broken a window, then heard footsteps and thought someone had broken in. She ran to the neighbors, called the police and her mom, and waited there. When they arrived, her room was exactly as she left it with nothing moved at all.

Her sister was once attacked while she slept, and even had red marks around her neck when she raced to her parents room to inform them that someone was choking her in her sleep. She said she woke up, couldn't breath, but didn't see anyone there. A second later, she was fine again, but was convinced that she saw someone while she first woke up.

Sometimes, every pantry/drawer in the kitchen would be open at once, when they were all out of the house. They also had a porch swing that would sometimes rock itself when there was no wind or anything.

My wife's mom kind of went unhinged and became paranoid that there were people coming into their home stealing stuff/moving stuff, even though they all agreed that there was some weird ghost-like action going on. Shortly after she had a semi-breakdown and was walking around the house with a shotgun looking for the ""intruder"" they moved out of the house for unrelated reasons. I sincerely believe she might have totally lost it if they had stayed. Around this same time Suzy's dad started using drugs heavily as well.

Her family is very Southern Baptist and only talks about paranormal activity in a jesting way. None of them seem to think much of their experiences at their old house, other than to tell their occasional stories about their ghosts. I thought to post on here because her sister was saying the other day that her drams **always** take place in that house, even if it's an unrelated subject/time in her dream. To my surprise, Suzy, her brother, and her mom all discussed how weird that was because they all had recurring dreams about the house too... almost every night. None of them seemed to think it was weird. 

Anyways, sorry for the giant wall of text and I'd be interested to know what anyone thinks.

TL;DR
My wife lived in a haunted house for 5 years. It almost made her mom go nuts and might be responsible for her dad's sudden drug use (never even drank alcohol before).",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1in7fa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1in7fa/a_few_stories_from_my_wifes_childhood_home/,

If anyone's experienced anything similar I'd love to hear about it...here goes...

Many years ago (2003?) my band played a gig in Waco, Texas. After the show my girlfriend and I started driving back toward the interstate to go back to Austin and immediately got lost in Waco...even though this place was just a few turns off the highway. We found ourselves in a completely deserted part of town. No people walking around, no lights in buildings, etc....very eerie. After driving around in circles for a long time I spotted a guy on a street corner - just standing there - when I made a left turn. I then heard - in my ear as if from the back seat - a male voice casually say ""You're going the wrong way."" I noticed that I was indeed going the wrong way down a one-way street. I said, out loud, ""Ok thanks"" and turned around...this road led directly back to the highway...I had also been going the wrong way in that respect.

I was so caught up in being lost I didn't snap to the fact that I'd physically heard a voice from someone who was not in the car. I asked my girlfriend ""Did you hear that guy say we're going the wrong way?"" She immediately burst into tears and said she had and was totally freaked out and then developed a bad headache.

Once back on the highway things felt normal. I hadn't recognized it at the time, but the entire time we were lost in Waco had felt otherworldly...like a dream...but it wasn't until we were back on the highway and things were back to normal by comparison that I really realized it.

It should also be noted that on this night I had only a single beer and zero other intoxicants and this event happened at only around 11:00 pm so I was not drunk or fatigued.

In addition to working and going to school, I had to seek treatment for a difficult illness that is only now beginning to get better. Starting with the week that I began first seeking treatment, I started to find dimes in very random spots in my home. I don't usually carry money, especially not change, so I really started paying attention. 

The first dime I found in a strange place appeared on the ironing board under the iron I was using. I opened the ironing board, ironed a shirt or two with the iron, set it down to get the next shirt and when I picked the iron up again there was a dime. I then found them on windowsills, under my pillow, on my lap when I was sitting down, falling out of books when I'd open them, etc. 

The dimes always seemws to start showing up again when I was (or am, even) feeling particularly upset about the past year of illness or when I begin to feel hopeless. After I realized the pattern, I looked up the meaning of finding dimes. The good ol' internet told me that dimes were wishes of luck and reassurance from the other side, but I wanted to see if any of you knew anything about finding them? 

Dimes specifically, it's never pennies or nickels or a bunch of coins. And I can never quite decide if these types of experiences are paranormal or coincidental.

1343285232.0,58,self.Paranormal,x6fc4,Demons Stole my Childhood,FuzzyBlumpkinz,84,26,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/x6fc4/demons_stole_my_childhood/,"This is all fuzzy, as these events happened between 15 and 5 years ago. I'll try to recount the horrors that I witnessed while growing up in a rural town in New Mexico as thoroughly and truthfully as I can. Keep in mind though that time and imagination may have distorted many of these memories, and the fact that until very recently many of the more terrifying experiences seem to have been repressed. 

In 1988 my parents moved into this house in a small but relatively wealthy town in southern New Mexico. They moved with my two older brothers, aged 2 and less than 1 at the time. The first Events began in 1991, as my mother was near the middle of her pregnancy with me. This event is hard to talk about, as this first manifestation was the catalyst for a lot of negativity to come in the home, which I feel lent the power for future events. 

My father was a very religious man, as well as very kind hearted and loving, and my parent's marriage at this time was what my mom described as ""heavenly"". Yet one night, as my mother lay with my father's arms around her, she felt a pull arching her spine up, as though my father were trying to lift her from the bed. As she turned to ask what he was doing, she was perplexed to see that he was staring straight at the ceiling, eyes wide open and mouth agape in a silent scream. His entire body had been lifted from the bed and sat suspended a couple of inches from the mattress, his arm with her on it had followed suit. As she stared, her mind trying to make sense of what she was seeing, he was thrown from the bed and onto the floor, at which point he scrambled to the adjoining bathroom on all fours. From his account, between heaves as he vomited into the toilet, he would peer around the doorway to see an entity - the darkest blackness that you could imagine, sitting on the bed where he had lay. It beckoned him to embrace it, opening its arms wide to take him, he feared for his pregnant wife who sat oblivious to it - but he couldn't form words without ejecting into the bowl. He refused to enter that room for weeks following that experience - a hardened soldier and farmer afraid of his own bed. Eventually they would both write the experience off as a strange dream. 

My brothers, who had often slept with my parents or in the living room, were made to sleep in the second bedroom of the house once I was born. They hated it as they often had nightmares when they slept in the room - but my mother would have none of it and put them in a pair  of twin beds. Years would pass and their nightmares turned into sleepless nights, often screaming in terror and sobbing due to the ""black people"" in their closet. Finally being fed up, my parents decided to spend the night in their room to prove to them that there was nothing to be afraid of. As the family doze to sleep that night, my mother and oldest brother fully falling asleep, a figure caught my father's eye. To his horror he witnessed several silhoutettes, identical to the one he had seen years before, manifest before his eyes. The brother who was awake began to cry as he saw them, my father sat frozen in absolute fear. He described them as humanoid figures, except that their very bodies were darker than the dark room in which they sat - almost absorbing any sort of light around them. And eyes - he said that he couldn't see the eyes, but he knew they were there, and they were staring at him and his famly, he could feel the hatred and malevolence pouring out of them. Then they began to beckon to him again, asking them to step into their world - my brother panicked at this and screamed, snapping my father out of his trance. He grabbed me - who had lay in a stroller, and my oldest brother and ran for the door with my other brother in pursuit, my mother followed in a sleepy haze, questioning what happened. 

It was at this point that things really began to turn into a horror story around my house - the environment that my earliest years were spent in. My father, with his fears becoming reality, fell into a depression that evolved into alcoholism. He stopped going to church, and developed an angry, irritable personality that lead to him and my mother screaming at each other for hours a night, broken glass, and a sobbing mother. The negativity and tension in the house was terrible, it felt like a constant humidity. It made the things that were now permanently called ""the black people"" far more active, despite the fact that for many months my mother refused to believe they existed. 

During that time a lot of poltergeist activity occurred - pans falling off of hooks, chairs tipping over, electronics turning on or off. The next major event to happen was when I was about 4 years old. I woke my mother up because I thought that my uncle had come to visit - a figure with a similar silhouette was pacing around the bed that I shared with my parents, rubbing our legs. My mother gasped and shook my father awake - whispering to him that she could see someone around the bed. My father, a normally strong and burly mans-man, was a nervous wreck when it came to these things and immediately jumped out of bed - at which point the thing seemed to sink into the darkness. Once my father turned the light on, nothing was left. 

My father demanded that we move out of the house, my mother told him that we couldn't afford to move...this lead to one of the worst fights that I can recall my parents having. One in which my father left us for days to fall into a drunken stupor at his farm. During the few days(I think it was 3) there was a storm that knocked out the power in the house. This began probably the most terrifying night of my life, of which many memories are still coming back to be because for several years I seem to have completely blocked this night from my mind. I remember my brothers and I huddling with my mother in our kitchen, we could hear voices speaking to us throughout the house. We couldn't leave as the storm outside was the worst the region had seen in years, and my father had taken our only vehicle when he had gone to the farm. My mother tried singing up lullabies and stroking our heads to get us to sleep - but there was no use, the walls themselves were screaming over her. The house trembled on its foundation, the footsteps rattled the floor as these things stomped. The candles wouldn't stay lit, something kept blowing them out - the flashlights had long since died. My mother held us so tight - she honestly believed that we were going to die that night. Then it came...I still can't remember it myself 15 years later, but my mother and brother describe it as a blood curdling howl. Like a woman screaming in pain or an ape in anger, loud enough to leave their ears ringing. It was coming from the second bedroom and seemed to be approaching from the hall. My mother grabbed us and pulled us across the house into the master bedroom where she locked the doors leading out of it. She pulled us into bed and the covers over our heads and we all held onto a King James bible while she recited verses, praying for our protection. Hours were spent there until the thunder and voices and screaming stopped and we could see daylight through the comforter. 

My father returned the next afternoon, he told us a story of how he sat in his truck, stuck because of the mud. How he could see the things from the house walking through his fields, he could see fog against his windshield as through something were breathing on them. How one of the figures looked like an animal from hell, and how its face made him duck onto the floorboard - wishing he could be home with us. They tormented him too that night, but he refuses to say much of it.

After this point my parents decided to have the house blessed by a local priest. The priest came and performed his ritual, at which point the worst of the activity stopped including the black apparitions - but something unseen still lurked in the house. 

At this point I had turned 6 or 7, and the house had become relatively friendly. For Christmas I was given a toy, it was a clown with a baseball cap and cannon arm. It would launch foam balls that I could hit with a small plastic bat, and make fun beeps and boops. I had been moved into the second bedroom at this point along with my brothers. This toy, weeks after having grown bored of it, began to operate itself. Launching random balls, making random beeps - it wasn't too terrifying as we wrote it off as a glitch. One evening as it sat in the closet refusing the stop beeping I complained to one of my relatives who was visiting at the time - the man walked into the room and opened the battery compartment - removing the D battery that powered it. As he walked out of the room, the toy made a new sound - one that to this day makes my skin crawl and my eyes water. The little s.o.b. cackled and turned his head toward my uncle, before the words ""can't hurt me"" came out of it. The memory is fuzzy at this point, as I'm positive that I came unglued at that, but apparently my relative took the toy outside and smashed it before taking it to the landfill.

Thought I would post here to share some strange experiences in my new home.


First of all I think I should start of by saying that I’m quite sceptical when it comes to “paranormal” things, I’m more a man of science than faith, however I keep an open mind. This post might be a bit long winded so I apologise in advance but I think I should detail as much as I can.


Secondly, my dates are as accurate as possible, I didn’t note them down at the time as I didn’t see the relevance but I’ve tried to recall them as best I can.


So, 3 years ago I had my first ever lucid dream, it involved my grandfather who had passed away several months earlier, we were standing at the old war memorial we used to go to for remembrance day every year, he told me that I had to find something, I’m sure at the time he gave me more detail but all I can remember is he gave me a name and a sequence of numbers which I think resembled a phone number, the name was “Gib Common” – no mention of if it was a place or a person, and he gestured toward a general direction nearby.


As it was such a surreal experience, I noted down the name and asked my family about it, no-one knows what it means and it’s not listed as being a place anywhere near here, or in fact anywhere. A few days passed and I dismissed it as being down to stress and that it meant nothing.


Fast forward to 6 months ago, my wife and I were searching for a new home, we found a lovely old building in the old part of town and we moved in before Christmas. Ok so nothing weird there right? Well within the first week of moving in we always felt uneasy in the building, as if someone was always watching you, it’s a feeling I’ve never felt before and my wife also shared the same feelings. There was one occurrence where it felt so much like someone was standing behind me that I turned around expecting to see my wife and yet saw nothing, at this point I was slightly concerned.


The same week, my wife was in the bedroom when she heard me talking to her from the hallway, she couldn’t make out what I was saying so after several times of telling me to speak up she went to the doorway to find that I wasn’t there, I was in the living room at the opposite end of the house with my headphones on playing on my PC, I was not on any voice servers or Skype so I’m adamant I didn’t shout anything or say anything she could of misunderstood for me speaking to her.


This same week I recalled the dream I had with my grandfather, to my amazement I realised, we were living in the home opposite the war memorial in the area he told me to find something, things were certainly not adding up.


The day of this realisation is when we had our first (and to date only) physical incident, the light bulbs in our living room are quite old as are all the fixtures in the home, my wife and I were watching TV when a bulb fell out of the socket and onto the floor. Our ceilings are higher than usual and the floor is solid wood, I was surprised to find the bulb hadn’t smashed when it hit the floor, so I went to pick it up and as soon as I touched it, it smashed. It was also strange to find that the bulb is a screw-in fitting, I can’t explain why a screw in bulb would fall out on its own accord, let alone survive the fall to a wooden floor then smash when touched.


I can’t remember the time frame, but I think it was within a month of this that I had my second lucid dream, this time I was in the living room of the house and there was a man shouting through the window to me, I don’t know why but at the time I had the impression that he used to live at the house many years ago, he was very angry and ranting at me, once sentence stood out in particular – “Is that all we are to you? People who share stories with one another?”, I don’t know what that sentence means, it’s not a phrase I’ve ever heard before.


When I thought things couldn’t get stranger, they did, my wife and I have noticed on several occasions that animals will congregate near one of the windows to the house and just stare into it, even if you approach the window they will still remain transfixed on the window. Animals vary from squirrels to birds, several birds have also attempted to peck at the window but I can only guess that this is due to their reflections?


By this point, my curiosity got the better of me and I started to research the house for anything. I found nothing relevant, I found census records of 1911 showing it used to be a doctors surgery and apparently it used to be an orphanage too. I was trying to see if I could find anything related to the Gib Common name my grandfather told me about but I’ve not found anything even close.


Last night my sister moved into the spare room for a few months while she’s in-between places and I had another lucid dream, same window but this time a woman who was angry that someone was staying in her room, I’ve never had any dreams like this but within 6 months I’ve had two in this home.


So, there it is, I’m not saying it is or isn’t paranormal, I just thought I’d share my experiences with you, the only other point ill mention is that neither myself or my wife drink, take drugs or have been on any medication, so I can’t link the dreams to that.

1. About 10pm last night I went to the bathroom and I could hear something really weird coming from the basin. On the basin there is an automatic soap dispenser that will dispense soap if it senses movement... it was going off non-stop but no one was near it, just pouring soap everywhere, eventually i had to take the batteries out.

2. That night I went to sleep not thinking anything of it. I woke up at around 430am because I'd had a horrendous nightmare about who I would describe as, i don't know, Satan I guess? He was demonic, just staring at me, I was petrified, I couldn't see his face but i could see his tongue was protruding from his mouth and was violently contorting. 

3. The next day I'm tired and still thinking about how fucked my nightmare was. I haven't had a nightmare in years. When I get home from uni, my night is uneventful and I go to bed. While in bed I do a bit of reading, then I roll over to turn my bed side lamp on and something catches my eye.. there's liquids dripping all down my walls, it's not water.. i dont know what it is. It's darker than water, and there are some patches in my room where it is really dark. I can provide more photos upon request. http://imgur.com/7HMiqT8

I'm laying in bed now, the walls are dripping and i'm too scared to fall asleep.

EDIT 1: I live in Melbourne, Victoria... the weather is dry at the moment and my apartment is so old that there is no heater. There's no possible way this liquid is a result of condensation. This is my apartment complex http://imgur.com/DkW5vCO my apartment is on the second floor, the middle set of windows (darkest) look into my living room. I'm going to my upstairs neighbours in the morning and ask them what is happening.

1369783501.0,54,self.Paranormal,1f8dgw,[EXPERIENCE] My parents' experiences with a demon/malevolent spirit in a hotel room,WoolenWolf,77,23,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1f8dgw/experience_my_parents_experiences_with_a/,"I posted this in a comment earlier but thought it might be worth it's own post.  Sorry for any confusion, it's been written hastily on my phone. Please don't hesitate to ask any questions. 

In 2011 my mother and father both had experiences in a hotel room with some sort of entity. My dad had been staying there for ~2 weeks (he works in the film industry so he's in one of two major cities for weeks at a time, 2-4hrs from home) and had been experiencing feelings of dread, hate, misery, and suicidal thoughts. My dad has *never* been like that- and I'm practically a photo copy of his personality (though I look just like my mom), and this is very, very abnormal behavior. He had been plagued with these thoughts endlessly while he was there, his only relief being on the weekends when he would come home to us. 

At some point my mom went to visit him during the week and stayed in the hotel room with him. She slept restlessly and was uncomfortable throughout the night. He left for work at 7am, and she awoke enough to kiss him goodbye (from bed) and fell back asleep, though she says it was strange because she doesn't remember actually being asleep or awake, it was just a strange idleness. 

At 7:30 she awoke to a feeling of supreme dread, feeling an *evil* presence. She felt someone pinning her arms to her side and pressing down on her chest as if it were laying on top of her. She thought she was being raped until she opened her eyes and no human was there. She could see something, but it wasn't physical... She could see through it but it was there. 

Now I know what you're all saying, classic sleep paralysis. I have my own thoughts about that which I'll explain shortly. First, though: she called my dad in tears, and he told her about his experience in the hotel. She left and occupied herself in the city, and when dad got off work, they went to the front desk to change rooms. I'm not sure if the attendant asked or if they volunteered the information, but they explained why, and they were told they were the fifth set of guests to have moved rooms because of negative paranormal experiences. 

As far as sleep paralysis goes... I believe that rather than a way to explain away and allow for dismissal of encounters, that it's actually a product of encounters. How many experiences with evil a day are posted on /r/paranormal that are pissed away as sleep paralysis? Honestly, I'll probably be downvoted away for that, but that's what I believe.

EDIT: Because I'm a big giant dummy I left out important information. Hotel clerk said someone killed themselves in the room. Still face palming over that, sorry.

It's pretty strange though I must say, I hope this is the right subreddit for this sort of thing. I'll keep it short and sweet, pretty much I woke up in the middle of the night, 3-4 AM, with a kind of creepy feeling, like that feeling you're being watched. I looked over at my fiance to make sure he just wasn't trying to scare me but he was fast asleep. I then look up and around the room and something catches my eye, like a figure. It's pitch black so I kind of strain to see it, but as my focus I see a tall woman. My immediate thought was, ""AW FUCK NO"", but  I collected my rational thoughts and decided it just could not be real. I was either still asleep or maybe there was something wrong with the shrimp I ate earlier. I kept staring, and she was still there though. Only 4 feet away from me I saw almost every detail, she was maybe 5'8"", very, very thin in a white, long dress, a bob like hair cut, wavy and sort of wet looking, gray skin, and her eyes were as if she was suffering from acute liver failure and very dry. What got me the most was the smile, this grin that wasn't evil, but wasn't all to pleasant either. I felt like i was staring at her for at least 20 minutes. Eventually I just tried to fall back asleep and hid behind my fiance. I could fall asleep, I still felt something watching. I looked back up maybe 10 minutes later and saw nothing. I had decided that morning not to tell my fiance as he would have flipped all of the shits about it (he is frightened easily.) Although after what he told me after he woke up I had to tell him what I saw.

He wakes up and tells me he had a nightmare, what he told me was that he was in house during the apocalypse when sees a demon woman standing behind him in the living room of the house. He described the woman and it was almost just as I saw her, but with slight differences, the eyes and the clothing. The eyes in his dream were pure black and he says she was wearing a flannel shirt and pants. 

We were wondering if anybody could possibly have any answers for this?
What it could mean?
If it means anything at all?

1364314144.0,58,self.Paranormal,1b1q25,My mother is convinced something paranormal follows me,MagnaKendra,67,9,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1b1q25/my_mother_is_convinced_something_paranormal/,"Weird things began happening to me when I was about thirteen. My family and I lived in a house that we had built ourselves, it was built on an area that was once a landfill, so the stories of a haunted house being on an old cemetery don't apply here.

It all started when my mother got pregnant with her fourth child. We got one of those plush baby toys that had the ""Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord my soul to keep"" poem playing when you squeezed it. For some reason, this toy really bothered me. I was a latchkey kid, so I would come home from school and be home alone for hours before anybody else was around. At first, this toy made me really uncomfortable, and I would throw it in closets and close the door and not think of it until it was out again. 

Fast forward a couple months, and this toy started playing the poem without anyone touching it. I let it go, assuming it was just a glitch and kept throwing it in closets. After that started, other things began happening that I didn't relate together until some time after. My bedroom started getting cold. It was so cold that I put a thermometer inside of my room and just outside of my room, and the room was always about 20 or 30 degrees colder than the hallway. Also, my older brother started getting very mad at me for throwing rocks at him. I might have thrown a rock at my brother every now and then (who doesn't), but he was being hit by rocks so hard that they left welts on his body. It only happened when I was around him. These are just some examples.

None of these things ever really bothered me much until one night, just before my youngest sibling was born. The plush toy was sitting on the diaper changer in my mother's room, as were other baby nicknacks and such. My mother recalls the toy glitching out with the poem all night, but she was nine months pregnant and slept through most of it. When she woke up the next morning, the plush toy had its face shoved into the corner of her closet along with other things for the new baby. The closet was filled with various baby items from all over the house, but they were all violently shoved in.

At first, we all thought I was sleepwalking. It was no secret that I hated the toy and often kept it in closets. But that was ruled out very quickly because I had a friend over that night and I would have had to crawl over my friend, open my squeaky bedroom door, walk through the house collecting items, open my mother's bedroom door and her closet door, and proceed to violently throw things around. In a three bedroom house that has five people and two dogs living in it, as well as a guest, it wasn't possible for me to have done all of that without waking anybody. This incident always bothered me.

Fast forward seven years and I'm moved out and living across the state. Our seemingly harmless poltergeist hasn't made an appearance in quite some time. My younger sister has since moved into my old bedroom, and they haven't had any problems with the cold in there since I left.

I rarely ever visit home, but for weeks after I do, my mother has noticed odd things starting up again. Cell phones and remotes fly across the house on their own. Just little things like that. There was one incident where the new puppy was restless, often getting up to check on the kids, and the next morning there was an unknown burn mark on one of the blankets. 

My mother is certain that I am followed by something unknown, but I'm not as sure. Maybe my energy is different or somehow off, causing tiny disruptions in daily life. It is something that continues to be on the back of my mind, and every once in a while, makes an unsettling reappearance.

Even without an existence of paranormal activity it is scary in its own right, these events make it even worse.

I'm 20 now, so these events have been happening for a while. They are often yet very subtle. Almost every time I am home alone I will hear doors opening and closing downstairs like my sister has come home, I always go down to check but no one is ever home. 

Two very strange events have happened to me. The first took place a few years ago. I was with my girlfriend and we were standing in the middle of my room talking. When suddenly my guitar (which was no where near me) plays each note highest to lowest as if someone plucked each string perfectly within a 3 second time frame. Chills went down both of our spines and we just looked each other as the last note echoed the room. My girlfriend wanted to bolt out of there but I said to not worry, I had experienced many things before that and I wanted to let whatever it was in the room that I wasn't afraid of it.

The second event, mum and I were in the living room watching tv as we suddenly heard the shuffling of metalware in the kitchen next to us. We were the only ones home so we kind of just froze. It stopped for a few seconds then the sound started again. We didn't bother to investigate because by now we realise there is definately something paranormal

Besides this there have been countless little things which I have witnessed. Such as moving glasses, retracting blinds, appliances turning on etc. it seems whatever it is it always does it when we are on the other side of the house.

I was very young, not even in kindergarden yet, and I was terrified to sleep in my bedroom. In my room there was a large window that looked out into the back yard. On my bed i could look out and see the whole thing. Anyway, every time I laid down to sleep I would see something in my back yard that terrified me. I called it the ""pink monster."" I can only describe it as a very large pink art mannequin with a featureless, blank face. This ""monster"" would walk around my back yard and stare into my bedroom window. It would even come up to my window and pound on it, staring in.

It terrified my parents and they had no clue what was wrong. They never saw it themselves because whenever they would go outside to investigate, it would disappear. This happened periodically for a few years. When I was five years old my brother was born, and my bedroom was moved down the hall into the spare bedroom where I had no view of the back yard.

When my brother got a little older he began being terrorized by something in the back yard too. When my mom asked him what was wrong, he could only say that there was a ""pink monster"" outside his window. The monster haunted him periodically like it did me, but after a few years they stopped and we haven't seen it since. 

It still gives my family chills. There's no way he could have heard about the pink monster from anyone else because we didn't talk about it.

Ghost hunting shows.  A show is a performance.  There is a good deal of money involved with any show on a major cable network and the main objective of any television network is to earn revenue through advertisements seen by viewers tuning in to watch interesting content.  If the interesting content fails to be ""interesting"" then the viewer count will plummet and so will the revenue generated through advertising.  These circumstance have an extremely negative impact on the integrity of results presented at the conclusion of any investigation because it is in the production crews best interest to present said ""evidence"".  

  Secondly,  The methods I have seen employed on many of these shows to detect spirits is as far from what I know to be scientific as it can get.  They spend very little time at locations, have very little control over the environments they are in, and the investigators do not have experience in fields that would be relevant in order to justify their opinions on their own results. Sure they try to debunk certain claims and come up with rationale explanations, but that's isn't going far enough.  For any part of spirit detection to be considered valid it would have to be performed in this manner, in my own opinion.  An unbiased/independent research team comprised of scientists from various relevant fields with experience in, for example weather, biology, physics, psychology, electro-mag,  etc., would have to set up at the most supposedly haunted location on the planet.  They would have to do their best to isolate that environment from any type of outside interference in order to avoid the contamination of evidence and the destruction of certainty.  Then they would have to stay there for a significant period of time while constantly monitoring all sorts of various aspects (emf, radioactivity, temperature, humidity levels, time, etc.) of the environment while recording video in multiple spectrum's, from various angles.   Then and only then after something like this occurred and they gathered substantial, credible, positive data would I think the idea of ghosts, spirits, and haunting would be looked at as valid and not just another urban legend or loose screw.

1371743393.0,58,self.Paranormal,1gqebk,"For 5 years, I lived with 'Henry', our ghost. He's still there.",Cynnimon,75,17,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1gqebk/for_5_years_i_lived_with_henry_our_ghost_hes/,"Hello, it's my first time posting on r/paranormal but I figured my story here may be an interesting read for you guys... no one but my family whom I lived with at the time believes us. It would be nice to talk about it, too.

To give some back information on myself, I'm a 25 year old woman currently married and raising a little one, enjoying my perfectly *normal* apartment after 5 years of living in what we believed to be an apartment that held some sort of haunting.

To begin, we moved into our apartment complex the day they opened the front doors. We were the very first tenants to reside there. They were beautiful apartments in a pretty undeveloped part of town that has since flourished and grown.

When we first moved in, everything seemed typical and normal, I was looking forward to starting the year at my new school and had just turned 17. The apartment never gave us any cause for worry until about 2 months in, my mother and I had our first experience.

At the time, my stepfather was sleeping in the bedroom for his graveyard shift, and she and I were doing dishes in the kitchen. At the same time, we both saw what can best be described as someones pant leg swishing around the corner from the kitchen. It freaked us both out, and we looked around the corner, but nothing was there. We noticed the light underneath the bathroom door, and figured my stepdad had checked on us, then went to the bathroom. After about 20 minutes though, we shut off the water and could still hear him snoring..even though the light was still on. We brushed it off and that was that.

Over time, we had a ton of little things like that that would happen to us. All would be well, and then a dish would topple over in the sink. All would be well, and then the TV would change a channel, or mute, or rise the volume to maximum (*that* was fun)... My mom eventually announced, ""We have a ghost!"" and fondly named it Henry.

""I couldn't find my keys for two freaking hours and they were RIGHT HERE on the counter! Oh *Henry*!"" .. You get it.

After about our first year there, things started a bit escalating. My mom at night would be up playing on the computer while everyone else was sleeping (due to insomnia) and swear to god something would brush her hair, like someone gently running their fingers along it. She would look but nothing would be there. Sometimes she swore she could hear what sounded like, ""Hey."" ... but she had hearing problems and would ignore it.

The way our apartment was set up, if you walked from the living room to the kitchen, you could look all the way down the hallway and see into the master bedroom. Periodically when any of us would walk by, we would do a double take, insisting we saw a person in the master bedroom, either standing by or sitting on the bed. Every time we insisted it was a he and he wore a red shirt. We started to get scared more often, me especially as I'm very sensitive to scary stories.

My first experience alone you could say happened very early in the morning. I had woken up, and was enjoying that fresh but still in your bed feeling, when I heard someone whisper my name. I got up because I thought my stepdad was calling me out into the hallway, but when I got out there, I could hear him sleeping in their bedroom. No one was awake but me, but I clear as day heard someone whisper my name.

A few months later, my stepdad started complaining that something kept grabbing his feet at night while he tried to sleep, and he thought it was our cat. (The poor guy is huge, and his feet would dangle off the bed) ... everyone figured it was kitty, until my mom started complaining that her hair was randomly getting tugged when in bed, and she kept hearing a ""Hey!"" or ""Hello!"" while trying to sleep.

The final straw for me, a month before I moved out (because of this) happened one night when I went to bed. I had a blanket over my window to completely black out light, and to boot it was around 1 am. So...pitch black. I had laid down and closed my eyes, about to drift off, when my stepdad knocked on my door. I opened my eyes and saw ... the only thing I can describe is.. the room was dark, but this was darker. It looked like a person, about 6 feet tall, and it rushed at me like it was going to attack me. I started screaming, kicking, and hid under the blanket ( lol ) and my stepdad burst in...and nothing was there.

I slept on the couch after that, refused to be anywhere the lights weren't on, and moved out REAL quick after that.

Here's the interesting thing. I moved out at 22. I went back 2 years later with my fiance (now husband) to visit and meet my family. During that time, I had not told him anything about that apartment mostly because I didn't want him to think I was weird. I had put my experiences behind me. Anyway, during that visit, my mother, stepdad and I went to a sort-of family reunion, and my fiance decided to stay and get some rest for our drive home. Afterward, he told me that when he had gotten up to go to the bathroom (which is located between my old room and the master room) he felt like he was being watched intently. He felt uneasy, and when he went back to the living room felt like he was afraid to close his eyes and rest. Apparently whatever was there that I experienced was STILL there enough to spook someone who never even knew anything was there.

Anyway, sorry it was so long but I wanted to share, hopefully you guys enjoyed too, and maybe had experiences as well. Looking back, Ive always wondered if there REALLY was a ghost there, or maybe it was just something faulty? A lot of our experiences and things we saw happened near the hallway and in my bedroom, which had our circuit breaker box right above my bed. I've heard before about fear cages and stuff?

My parents purchased the home from an elderly woman who was going into a nursing home, her husband had died several years earlier from a heart attack.

*Something strange happened this morning. My Husband is off on vacation. We were in bed, somewhere around 6 am, I heard footsteps coming from the front door, up the landing steps and into my Son's room. Then I heard footsteps go from his room into the bathroom. I heard the shower turn off and the water running. I thought my Son had come home early from his re-enactment in Reading. I was pretty angry with him because I thought he had invested so much time and money into this group, that he was leaving them without support for the days' activities. I called out to him, but there was no answer. I heard the water turn off, then the foot steps went back down the landing and down into the family room. I decided to check out what was going on with him. My Son was not downstairs, his car was not in the driveway. I went into the bathroom. The shower curtain had been pulled back, but the tub/shower was 100% DRY! I checked out the remainder of the house and it was sealed tight.* 

*I know we have someone else living with us because My Son has seen him on several occasions, each time he waves and goes back to wherever he originated in the first place. He is the original owner of this house, and he does things, like open doors, ring door bells, opens cabinets, occasionally opens the garage doors. His name is John.

My father moved us around the country a lot so I was always adjusting to new places.  There are some things I remember vaguely and some things are so clear but I would like to be able to forget.   I was about 5 or 6 at the time, things seemed to be fine nothing too traumatizing.  I had my toys, TV and my favorite cereal.  
On this particular night my mom was working and I was home alone with my dad.  We were just hanging out watching TV.  My dad fell asleep on the couch and to this day I can’t forget or rationalize what happened next.  I remember feeling a little bit sick leading up to this incident. My show had ended and I stood up and looked over at my dad sleeping on the couch.  Slowly out from behind the couch a shadow crept up the wall.  It materialized into a figure.  The best description I can offer up is like a giant demonic humanoid looking rabbit.  It had big yellow teeth that were sharp and gnarled.  It had grey fur that was matted and had an oily sheen.  It rose to about 7 feet.  I stared at it in horror.  Its presence gave me an overwhelming feeling of dread. I couldn’t believe what I was seeing.  I began feeling nauseous and dizzy.   It finally made eye contact with me gave me a really sinister smile and shrunk down to a regular shadow again. When I think about it, it seemed surprised that I could see it.    
After that night things got real weird with my family and there was a lot of abuse specifically from my dad. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced anything like this or know of any demons that have a rabbit like form.  The abuse I suffered after that was horrible and basically ruined my childhood.  I still to this day fell uneasy when I think about it.

We were on top of Little Round Top where ferocious fighting occurred.  If you are unaware of Gettysburg, around 60,000 soldiers died in three days time.  It is said to be one of the key battles that decided the victor of the American Civil War.



When viewing this picture past the rocks in front of us is where the cliff drops off to a valley where Confederate troops tried to climb and take the high ground from Union troops.  



You can clearly see an 'Orb'.  There was no sunlight, but it was 'misting' out.  I am thinking that some sunlight managed to refract/reflect off of a tiny tiny water droplet and flew into the camera lens.  This is a small chance, but I would say a bigger chance then catching a perished soldier on camera.  It seems strange that it is moving upwards.  What do you guys think?

&gt;A good friend of mine sent me the above picture earlier today which was captured at night in Northern Georgia on a wildlife camera. The figure is almost “ghost like” and humanoid at the same time. My first thought was that this was just a regular person who got caught trespassing on cam and appeared “ghostly” due to lighting and other variables, or that it was a photo-shop. But after further investigation I wasn’t so convinced, there may actually be a paranormal aspect to this picture.

1369214729.0,55,self.Paranormal,1etpic,[Experience] It tried to take me when I was five.,alive41stime,70,15,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1etpic/experience_it_tried_to_take_me_when_i_was_five/,"My family and I moved around the country a lot as a child. I was in Virginia when it happened, meaning my experience happened in my very early youth. My best guess is that I was four or five.

I am an only child, but my room contained a bunk-bed because my friends were always sleeping over. The top bunk was always mine so on this particular night, that is where I was.

My bunk-bed was pushed against the far wall in the bedroom, but it could not be pushed into a corner. On the left side there was a closet with a door. On the right was a window and my parents put a little desk there.

So here goes... I went to sleep one night and was having a good old time in dreamland when I was abruptly woken up by a hand grabbing the top of my head. As I awoke I naturally jumped and as my eyes adjusted to the darkness, I saw the closet door open just a crack, and it was moving back into the closing position but it never made the final click of the door closing, it just sat there a little bit open.

I swear to you, I was maybe 5 years old and I knew that neither one of my parents had touched my head and then receded into that closet. And let me tell you, with 100% certainty, I was touched. I am sorry if this breaks some rules of this subreddit, but this story is not something I am making up or trying to write in the first person to give the impression of a memory, this did happen.

So let me explain how a small child deals with something like this.

I didn't call out to my parents, I was too shocked. A million things were going through my brain. I just sat with my head on the pillow staring at the closet door opened a crack, waiting for it to move again. Had it moved, I would have yelled as a last resort. But I didn't want to yell beforehand thinking that whatever was inside that closet would grab me and pull me in before my parents arrived and I would never be seen again. I stayed up that entire night.

This is how I absolutely 100% know this happened and was not a figment of my imagination. I shit you not, for the next four to five years, I slept with my head on the very, very, bottom-end sliver of the pillow. Seriously, if that is not a symptom of post traumatic stress disorder, then I do not know how else to explain that behavior. I am thirty years old now and remembering that I used to do that, for years, is extremely bewildering to me now.

Because it was not comfortable at all. It actually made sleeping comfortably quite difficult and gave me years of neck pain and stressed joints. Neither one of my parents ever commented on it, maybe they never noticed that when they would tuck me in, I would be slid down in the bed, with only the very tip of my head barely making contact with the pillow.

I can remember leaving that house in Virginia and moving to a new one. Almost as a learned habit, I continued to sleep like that for maybe another year or two before I literally had a epiphany one day and had to ask myself why I was sleeping like that.

But I guess memories of that hand making contact with my head had not completely left my psyche. I spent the next few months training myself to sleep on the pillow fully like a normal person and I had to keep reminding myself that I no longer lived in that house and there was no longer a closet door next to where I slept.

I made me flash back to memories of needing to close that closet door fully every time I went to bed and then, almost like someone with obsessive-compulsive disorder, having to make two or three checks before I was finally comfortable enough to allow myself to sleep.

And beyond this, I was otherwise a completely normal child. And while this was the first paranormal experience I remember, since then I have had many experiences with the paranormal in my life. I have always believed that some of us are more connected to the world of the unexplained and that the two sides somehow attract each other like the two sides of a magnet. I think that children are more in-tuned in general, maybe because you are much closer to your own birth. Maybe at four or five years old, I was attracting something and the strength on both sides actually allowed for a physical contact. I will never know its intentions or what would have happened if I was not a light sleeper and immediately woken up.

All I can tell you is that my bunk-bed was nearly seven-feet high, so whatever grabbed my head either climbed up the end of the bed or was very, very tall to begin with.

This is one of my first childhood memories. 25 years later and I can still remember how that touch felt.


**EDIT**: I have seen a lot of comments about the fact that it may have been a sleep 'jerk' or brain hallucination upon awakening. And I realized something. I did not emphasize the part about the closet door enough. I have actually had a lot of sleep hallucinations in my life, where I wake up and I think I see something, but it is always something nuts, like an electric dragon floating over me, or a crazy black shadow jumping back into the corner. 

And I have also experienced the sleep tremor of 'jerk' where you wake up suddenly feeling like you have fallen, or that you were touched, or some weird muscle spasm. Upon revisiting the events, before I posted this, I seriously came up with the theory that I was experiencing my ""first ever"" sleep muscle spasm and that can explain the feeling of a hand touching my head (sleep hallucination) while being abruptly woken up (sleep spasm). But there is one detail I cannot overlook.

**The closet door was moving when I awoke.** And it was not a sleep hallucination. And if it was, then it was the most realistic I have ever experienced in 30 years. Within seconds of feeling the touch and waking I immediately saw the closet door. I watched it move from being about a foot (12 inches) open, and slowly closing as if something on the inside were pulling it, trying to not make any noise. I watched the door slide into the opening, and since it was so slow, it did not make the final click, and then popped back out about an inch or two. It then kind of shook back and forth before finally stopping.

And it stayed like that. I watched it all night.

In every sleep-waking hallucination I have ever had, nothing in the real world has ever moved or been affected, only *added to* by the nonsense of my brain.

Things are kicking up again,DeaditeQueen,61,8,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1dyy90/i_posted_here_once_a_looong_time_ago_about_my/,"Ok, so at first I apologize. My initial story regarding my home was posted on a throwaway and I've list the link. Ill provide Cliff Notes as needed. And sorry in advance for the 'wall-o-text'

I've been living in this brand new house (completed Nov 08) for almost 4 years now (my husband had it built and has lived here since day 1). It all started with things disappearing and reappearing in the weirdest spots. Before we could even figure out what we thought of all that I had my first intense experience here. Basically I woke up about 3:30 in the morning to a mans voice saying ""Come and get me"". This was not a whisper or faint even, it was loud and clear. Now, I've just woken up to this and my brain is still foggy and while I'm trying to process what I've just heard I clearly hear a small girl say ""Don't go kitties."". The moment she said that I heard all 3 of our house cats take off like a stampede.

I can't ""imagine"" that. I was WIDE awake at this point. My husband is a very deep sleeper and since he had to be up early for work I debated waking him up. I look up from my childlike fetal position sucked up to my husbands back and there it was. Tall, all black but def the outline of a man. Im staring at him and suddenly on a bedroom wall the ""Shave and a Haircut"" tune was tapped out LOUDLY. I didn't sleep that night and only told my husband about it after he came home from work the following night.

Ok, that's was ""first contact"". It has gone from there and we have EVPS's captured by Black Hills Paranormal (TAPS Family) during an overnight investigation. All this stuff was happening and although it was far from malicious it was still stressing my husband, our daughter and myself out. Black Hills suggested we talk with ""George"" (the man we highly suspect is the older male) and tell him to leave since he just wasn't stopping.

Black Hills didn't know George, we did. At that point we began comfortable saying we really knew quite a bit about his temperament. Stubborn, but fair. We had ""compromised"" on a few issues, but the first talk of telling him to leave had him bugging our daughter and I got desperate. I conveyed to him that our spare bedroom (its used for storage at the moment) was his as long as he cut out EVERYTHING. After a few months incident free we were fairly satisfied that he accepted the deal.

Now my mother in law is having trouble in her relationship and there's been some talk of her coming here for awhile and staying the the spare bedroom. Well, George doesn't seem to like that.

After a very long time incident free, I was laying in bed the other night trying to fall asleep and suddenly I feel my ankle being grabbed (not pulled) very firmly, and the feeling held for a moment and then boom it was gone. I instinctually shot up, and once I realized what must have just happened I hear the little girl singing a tune. George started grumbling something but I just didn't quite catch it.

So now my mother in law is aware of our homes ""extra roomies"" and she believes but I HAVEN'T told her that the prospect of her moving here is pissing them off bc so far I'm the only one who has seen first hand that he's riled. I don't want it looking like the lamest excuse in the world for not having your mother in law move in with you! Seriously! 

My husband is adamant and personally I wouldn't care if it weren't for George. I simply don't want him harassing my daughter again. Ignoring him for now is my best option right now.

About 7 years ago (Im 21) me and my other bro and sis were out playing. They ran off to do whatever and I remember turning around to see this boy dressed in a white shirt with no other recognizable features walk into the garage. It was clear as day and I was not seeing things. I followed it into the garage and called out to him with no reply. The next day my dad saw the same thing. I will always remember that.

Now im older, and still find a liking to the paranormal. I hadnt seen the boy since. Just the other day i was out replacing a license plate on my car. It was a nice day out so figured I would take the time to do it. As I was working, I was concentrating on the small bolts that hold in the plate, a now older looking boy in a white shirt with the same hair as me walked up behind me, leaned down and looked at what I was doing. I saw this through the reflection in the paint. I turned to see no one, but i never caught my focus on the paint. There was no way it could have been my reflection because i was already viewing mine at the time.

By the way I have the audio from the last story. These may be hard to believe, but they are true and I can see how someone could have a hard time believing. 

A little back story: When my wife and I started dating we were 16 years old. A few months before we started dating her mom passed away from cancer in her house. When her mom was still alive the house had been broken into. Her dad put an alarm on the house to help deter this from happening in the future.

Instance #1 When I would go over there, there were times I would feel extremely uncomfortable, but didn't really say anything. We always set the alarm so her dad would have to call on the way home telling us to take it off instant. We were making out on the couch and hear the door chime (the sound from when the door opens with an alarm) and a door shut. She jumped off of me and whispered ""I thought you set the alarm."" I told her I did and we waited for her dad to walk in. After about 3 minutes I walk into the kitchen(where everyone enters) and noticed the alarm was still set on instant and that the doors were locked from the inside. I would have waved it off as an alarm malfunction from the noise, but we both heard the door shut.

Instance #2 While my wife and I were dating we were taking making out on the couch. We heard someone walking down the hallway and a door close. We figured it was her dad and I was a little scared, cause her dad is an intimidating guy. She said, oh well nothing we could do about it. We were sitting on the couch waiting for him to come out of his room. About 20 minutes later she went to check on him. She said he wasn't there. We checked the drive way and his car wasn't there. She called him at work and he said he had been at work and had not left since he got there. To this day, it still freaks me out.

Instance #3 My wife and I got accepted to different colleges and we would see each other on the weekends. While she was down one weekend her dad was talking about going to bike week in key west or some biking event. I asked him when he was leaving and he said he couldn't leave till Friday till my wife got there. I told him I could come by on Thursday night to feed his dog and let the dog out. He said o.k. I went over there that night and stayed less than 5 minutes. I felt extremely uncomfortable and heard footsteps down the hall. Let the dog out and I took off.

Instance # 4 We moved in after college for less than a month waiting to close on the house we bought. My wife coaches a sport and they were having their Christmas party at one of the parent's houses. I was at the house by myself hanging out watching T.V. in the bedroom. I heard footsteps down the hall and the dog walked out to the hall. I followed thinking her or her dad came home. The dog walked to the front door and was growling. The door handle jiggled and I turned on the porch light opened the door ready to kick some ass, but no one was there. The front of the door leads to a wide open area(not the kitchen door), and it is impossible for anyone to jiggle the handle and get out of view in 3 seconds. I picked up the dog and walked back to the room and shut the door.

Instance #5 My friend and I decided to ghost hunt there at my father in law's house while he was at some motorcycle event for the weekend. While we were there we were hanging out talking and heard some footsteps down the hall and I said, ""Shh. Did you hear that?"" He said, ""Yeah, the creak?"" followed by the loudest bangs - bam! bamm bammmm! We walked into the kitchen and nothing was there. We knew it came from the left(the kitchen) and we walked around there for over an hour trying to figure out what it was. Her dad was remodeling and nothing had fallen over. We slammed the cabinet doors opened and closed, but it was not even close to the sound we heard. We even went outside and there was nothing out of the ordinary. We tried slamming down some boards outside, but the noise was to low for it to be it. (One of us slammed boards outside while the other sat inside). We couldn't figure out what it was and to this day I am baffled. Every time we go over there I still look around trying to figure out what it could be.

Any insight or explanation to what this could be would be greatly appreciated because I have no explanation!

1371882522.0,49,self.Paranormal,1guey4,Dead band conductor wanted to give his final lesson.,H3ilSatan,64,15,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1guey4/dead_band_conductor_wanted_to_give_his_final/,"A bit of background on me and the school this happened at. I am a 19 year old girl who very much believes in the paranormal and takes a deep interest in it. My old high school is located in a very big city in Illinois. That's all I'll say about that, though.

I was around 17 when this happened. It was my junior year and my conductor had called an early morning jazz band rehearsal on this particular day since we had the day off the day before. Normally, early rehearsals require us to be there exactly at 7:15 a.m. or earlier since our conductors usually are in the band room by 6:30. Well that morning I happened to wake up early so I left to school earlier hoping to have a nice talk with both our conductors before the rest of my band mates got there. I got there maybe at 6:45 and as I climbed the final step up to the fifth floor where the band room was located (HUGE school) I yanked the first door to the bandroom open (Which is a huge metal door that is locked EVERY day after school is dismissed) and then the second door (Which is a huge wooden door that is also locked.) 

When I walked in there I expected to see our chairs assembled in the traditional jazz band formation and most of the percussion instruments out, but instead I was greeted by a dark room and just the light to our conductors' office on and their radio blaring the morning weather. This was during the winter, so it was still dark in the morning. Anyways I walked into the office and didn't see the usual laptop and belongings of either of the Mr. A's and well that threw me off a bit. I wondered if they'd both gone to the main office or anything else like that so I went back down to the fourth floor and sat on the steps to wait for them to get back, because, well let's face it, no one in their right mind stays in a huge dark room alone. 

About 5 minutes later (6:55) one of my conductors arrives with a handful of the other band kids and he smiles at me and greets me good morning. Once he draws his keys to open the two doors to the band room I mention that the doors are already open and he just chuckles and tries to open the huge metal door and it won't budge. I raised an eyebrow and he unlocked the door. Same thing with the second one and well I was at a loss for words cause I could've sworn they were open. To make things better the office was sealed shut and everything was off.

This is going to be long, so I apologize, however I think any feedback would be great!

I grew up in a very old house in a small town in Northern Utah.  This house was deemed historical by the city and my parents purchased it when I was just a baby.  Now I have four siblings and come from a religious family who obviously believes in the spiritual world.  I have always been a very large non-believer in my family religion, but have always been a believer in the paranormal.

Now a little more background, this house has always had strange things happen in it.  It was built in the mid 1800s and had been owned by MANY different people who would attempt to take on the task of restoring it, only to sell it when they realized how big of an undertaking it really was.  We don't know how many previous owners there were, however we do know a little about the man who originally built the house, Eli.  Eli did pass away in the house and was apparently a dislike lawyer in my hometown before passing unexpectedly in his sleep in the late 1800s.  Before we knew the history of Eli, we began to make restorations to the house.  Shortly after starting, my eldest sister started to have dreams of a man who would give her orders about what needed to be done with the house.  As time went on, the dreams became nightmares and happened more frequent.  He began to tell her that my parent's were destroying the house and he would not allow anyone to ""soil what he holds so dear"" and to get out.  That is when strange things started.  (If anyone is interested, I will post another thread with some other stories, however this is getting long as it is.)

I have a younger sister who is just 2 years younger than me who, like me, has always been very musically inclined.  When I was a junior in high school and she was a sophomore she got obsessed with teacher herself Damien Rice songs on the piano, and this particular week it was his song, ""9 Crimes"".  She had a habit (much to the dismay of all of us in the house) to play the piano early in the morning before I took her to school.  (Note: Our piano was the one that my great grandmother used to teach lessons on, and was made around 1915.  She purchased it used in the 1940s.)

My mom and I used to get up about an hour earlier than anyone else in the house in order to do yoga together and get ready for the day.  One morning I woke up to my alarm which was set a half hour earlier than normal.  Now I have always had a habit of peeking into my younger siblings rooms which are on the same floor as me (the top floor out of three and an attic) just to check on them.  When I looked into my little piano obsessed sister's bedroom, she was still fast asleep.  I then checked on my other two youngest and everything was fine there, so I began my descent down the long staircase in the early morning darkness.  

By now it registers that my alarm was off but I shrug it off and take the first step down. This is when I hear it.  The piano was very faintly playing ""9 Crimes"" only it was different, more professional.  Our piano room is shut off of the rest of the house by two sets of double doors that are usually open, only on this morning they were shut.  

I paused and listened for a moment and realized that it was almost as though two sets of hands were playing different chords of the song.  That was not my sister.  

I walked back up the steps and quietly peeked into my sister's room, who was still fast asleep.  When I started to walk back down the stars the music was still playing but one of the doors on the first set of French doors was slid open.  As soon as I stepped to the bottom of the staircase the music stopped and my mom walked out of her bedroom down the hall, still half asleep.  

I peeked into the room and the lid of the grand piano was closed and the room was empty.  I could see a lot of dust in the air as the sun was coming up.  When I told my mom she said that the same thing happened to her the week prior.

So there you have it.  Out of everything that has happened in that house and any other house since, that was by far the experience that shakes me till this day.

Freaking out.,hidemythundr,64,14,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1d9p32/just_experienced_something_very_strange_freaking/,"It's 10.30pm, about 20 minutes ago I was just browsing reddit when right behind me someone/thing said my name. Like a young girl in a high-pitched whisper. 

I'm shaking like crazy right now.

This isn't the first occurrence. A few weeks ago a light turned on in the middle of the night.

EDIT: Sorry for the lack of details last night, I was so spooked I posted this and went straight to a friends house. Firstly, I don't do drugs and hasn't been drinking. 

I live in an older style apartment on the bottom floor. I have timber flooring and everyone above has carpet over cement. I also have two cats so if I ever hear footsteps I blame it on one of those two things. 

I recently got out of a LDR, he moved out and I stayed. About two weeks after he moved out I started to experience a few strange things, like wall lights turning on in the middle of the night, my computer turning on by itself (though this could be a glitch and explained away), I heard my fridge open and close a week ago (but again there could be an explanation there) and more importantly, for about three nights in a row as soon as I put my head on my pillow to go to bed the pillow would gently move behind my head (I have experienced sleep paralysis so I know I wasn't asleep). The thing is that none of these occurrences spooked me like what happened last night. 

I was talking it over with my friend, it was my mothers birthday on Saturday (she passed away a few years ago) my friend suggested that because I was upset on Saturday I might have sent a signal out that might have generated enough energy to get a signal back on Sunday. In no way did I consciously want to be contacted by my mum, and if it is her,  does not asking her to leave mean that I'm keeping her from moving on in the afterlife?

1365635590.0,54,self.Paranormal,1c3ime,Possession? Two years ago I was on my bed and my body was moving inadvertently. Something communicated with me through my body language.. This is not a joke and I WISH to know what exactly I am dealing with.,ThrowAway20209,87,33,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1c3ime/possession_two_years_ago_i_was_on_my_bed_and_my/,"**What happened?**

Back in early 2011 I was laying in my bed, fully awake and my body started moving on it's on. I could see through my eyes what was happening and could verbally speak. My arms were shifting left and right, my foot was tapping, my fingers were tapping, my shoulders kind of shrugged.. the body language seemed to communicate waiting.

I had asked: ""Is there anybody there?""

Immediately, my right hand clenched and gave me a thumbs up.

Again, I was fully awake.

I asked whatever it was, about 100 times, if it was demonic. I got a thumbs down each time.

I had asked a bunch of yes or no questions and if things were overtly complex I would get a sideways thumb for ""needs further explanation"". Basically, I asked a lot of questions and I didn't always get a yes or no answer.

This ""possession"" happened 2 other times. 

The 2nd time it happened I had a pen and paper and it communicated with me that way.

I asked for it to prove itself and it wrote down a bible scripture. I went to go to my bible and opened up the verse (I am really sorry I cannot remember what it was) but the answer was always the same (I asked about 3 more times, claiming beginners luck) that essentially, when God (or it's angels) communicate with you that you shouldn't be in fear, that you should listen. It was usually something along those lines about a deity communicating with a human.

I remember in particular that there were things I needed to hold close to me, that everyone should know.

* There is an afterlife. It's very broad to talk about but essentially there are multiple layers to where one may go, there are degrees of heaven and hell and not just two paths.

* That coincidences are not always coincidental.

* That you should be nice to everybody.

* That everything DOES happen for a reason.

* That cynicism is nihilism is death because it blasphemies life. 

Anyway, I have SO much more to say about this but I don't want to type up a jumbled and long post. 

If you have any questions, PLEASE ask me. I am still unsure of what exactly I am dealing with. It has mentioned it's kind of like my guardian angel.

(I understand that this may be a common occurrence as even Santana talks with the arch-angel ""Metatron"" or something like that. I don't know.)

**What to consider:**

* It was not sleep paralysis. I was fully awake at the time it happened.

* No, I had not ingested in alcohol or drugs.

* I do not have schizophrenia but I do have a mild form of depression.

* I have not visited any doctors, psychiatrists or people of spiritualism or religion about it. 

* There have been many coincidences it has pointed out. I recall back then that my friend would always pick me up to drive to our other friends house (a 2 minute drive). We stayed late and my friend joked about how our friend looked like a certain musician. That musician was on the radio as soon as we left in that duration of 2 minutes. I'd say out of the 40 times we've been to his place that this particular musician was on the radio at the time about 25% of the time.


**TL;DR** - Guardian Angel or my brain has moved my body inadvertently, communicated to me through non verbal expressions. I can channel it most of the time but I am not sure if I am fooling myself.

For example, I lived in my grandparents' house for a while (built in the 1830s), and I definitely felt at the time (I was about 11 years old) that there were spirits in the house.  There were many experiences that backed up that feeling.  

In contrast, my husband and I now live in a house that was built in the 1960s and I have never felt that the hose is ""haunted,"" but I've had some strange things happen in the house.  The first day we moved in about three years ago, I took the day off from work so that the furniture delivery people could drop off the couches and I could do some painting.  My husband was at work, so I was by myself.  After the delivery guys left, I decided to grab something to eat and relax and watch TV.  I turned the TV on and sat on the couch, but about three minutes later, the TV turned off.  I turned it back on, but it shut off again.  I thought this was weird, but didn't think anything of it and decided to go set up the back bedroom that we would use as our bedroom.  When I walked into that room, the TV in the bedroom TURNED ON by itself and started rapidly flipping through the channels.  At this point, I did totally freak out, and I ran out of the room and called my husband.  Since I believe in the paranormal and this was the first day in our new house, I was totally freaking out thinking that we were destined for a life in some nightmarish Poltergeist-ridden house.

When my husband got home from work about a half an hour later, he went into the room (the TV had since turned itself off; I hadn't gone back in there) and (probably just to appease me) told whatever ""it"" was that this was our house now and for it to please go away.

The only other weird thing that's happened was that I was watching my cat playing in the hallway one day (there are no windows in the hallway or any light sources that were turned on) and she suddenly stopped and looked inquisitively to her left.  About two seconds later, this greenish, glowing, teeny-tiny light-flash thing flew right past her.  She didn't chase it or anything, but just watched it zip by.  Very bizarre.

So to make a long story short, I really don't think my house is ""haunted,"" but I think it's possible that maybe people are coming by to visit or something(?).

Then 30 minutes pass, and you hear the same noises, only this time they actually arrive, and come in to the kitchen as expected.

I was at a friend's house and he lived in a wooded area.  We were out exploring in the woods.  Just walking around.  We came upon a section and up in a tree was an all white creature, in the shape of a human perched on a large branch.  As we approached, the head turned to us and was startled.  The tree branch broke and it fell from the tree and ran off on all fours.  We both screamed and ran away and tried to figure out what we saw the rest of the day.

There are a few things that stick out and upset me.  I am completely sure about these things.  It was pure white, it was in the shape of a human adult, and it ran off on all fours like an animal would.  I am sure it was human shaped because when we startled the creature, it turned it's head and looked at us just like a human head would turn and look at something.

This has been bothering me for many years and I was just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience or could help me identify what this was.

But anyways, there was a woman named Peg Entwhistle who jumped off the H of the Hollywood sign because i think she was failing at her job or something. I don't remember, but she committed suicide and now supposedly her ghost haunts there.

While we're laying in bed trying to get to sleep, I'm still tossing and turning to find my comfortable spot. When I finally do, I'm facing the wall. (My side of the bed is against the wall) She's laying on her side facing the wall too. So we had a small conversation and about 4 minutes of silence we're trying to drift off to sleep. 

Before I say what happened next, I do have to say that, I'm paranoid in the sense that I need to sleep with the door locked and I need to have our pets in the room so in case something were to happen I don't have to run around looking for them in the house. (I have 3 dogs and 1 cat) Besides, it eliminates any destruction that can occur at the paws of my dogs.Oh and my roommate was out of town for the weekend so it was just my girlfriend, me and my pets. Anyways, continuing on.

So, there's silence, between us, trying to drift to sleep when suddenly I hear the door knob to our bedroom shake, and then I clearly hear the door open. At first I thought I was probably about to experience sleep paralysis or something, but then my girlfriend reached out for me and tugged on my shirt with alarm, we froze. All of a sudden we hear the foot steps coming to our bed and we hear heavy breathing. At this point we're still frozen. I'm thinking, ""Is it an itruder? How do I fight him off?!"" It's like she's thinking the same thing, and we both get up, and she reaches for the light and turns it on. No one's in the room  and there's no sign of someone ever coming it. All this happened instantly.  

Since then I feel kind of uneasy. Last night, you can call it a mere coincidence, I again was laying in bed, and I had one of those ""Live Strong"" kind of bracelets on, and for some reason I can't sleep with it on, and long story short, I took it off I put it on the bed to lazy to put it on the dresser, and I went to sleep. I wake up with it on. The strange thing about that is, I'm left handed and I always have it on my left hand, I woke up with it on my right hand, and I KNOW I took it off. It might be sleep walking or again, coincidence, whatever it is it's messing with me and I'm not liking it.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1374072583.0,,,True,t3_1ihkte,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ihkte/the_other_night/,
1365442136.0,49,self.Paranormal,1bxgfq,I'm scared. What should I do?,mrnemo,62,13,78,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1bxgfq/im_scared_what_should_i_do/,"I am an atheist and skeptic. I'm a fan of James Randi, Penn &amp; Teller, Hitchens, Dawkins, etc. When I was a little kid, I always pretended to be Egon and wanted to be a scientist. I have never had any type of paranormal experience in my life and have raised an eyebrow when anyone speaks of such things, especially considering the Randi prize.

Recently, however, I've had a few experiences that have left me frightened.

The first event was about a month ago. I am married, have two dogs and two cats and I live in a condo. Condos aren't the quietest places, but I used to be a recording engineer so I am really familiar with EQ frequencies and I can kind of see the EQ curve of any sound in my head and tell the direction since this is required for mixing for film, etc. I also work at home and am pretty familiar with the ambient sounds of the condo (which is only a few years old) and the neighbors, cars, animals, etc.

So a month ago, my wife was at a bachelorette party and I was studying some programming crap. I usually have Spotify on in the background playing something like Music for Airports. 

I try to save power so it is usually pretty dark in the room aside from a spot light in the kitchen and outside lights (I am on the second floor). I have those three-tiered IKEA curtains and when I use all three layers, it can be pretty dark.

So when my wife was gone that night, not even particularly late (maybe 10:30-11PM), I was sitting at home and I felt this weird sensation. Pretty cliche, but I just felt weird and my stomach felt sour. I heard a ringing in my ears, very high pitched. Not incredibly loud, but definitely obvious. This is not unusual for musicians/engineers, so again, I ignored it. 

So I'm sitting on the couch feeling a bit weird and had a shiver. I stood up because I was worried I was dizzy or light-headed or something, but I was fine. I got a cup from the kitchen and got some water and squirted this Mio stuff in there. I was standing there drinking this foul water and I hear what sounds like a female voice in the other room, only muddled a bit. But not muddy as in a vocal track with the high-end cut and lots of mids; it was incredibly clear. 

It sounded like it said ""Who.......................... are..................... you............."" with these one or two second gaps. Again, it sounds cliche, but that is what I heard.

I just stood there drinking and ignored it because I refused to accept it was real. So I'm standing there a bit shaken but not too concerned and I start making this peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I remember everything about this. I was using this thick bakery bread with a bunch of seeds, a very poor choice for the classic sandwich, and I took a bite. Mid-bite, I hear the same voice, only this time it is close to me, behind me to the left near the refrigerator.

""What.....""

When I heard it, I freaked the fuck out and almost choked to death on my sandwich; I ran downstairs and out the door into the dark. My heart was in my throat along with a wad of peanut butter and I was panicking. I ran down the street and saw some middle-aged woman walking her crappy dog and talking on her cell phone. I didn't disturb her, I just wanted to hear a real person's voice. 

When I calmed down, I got in my car and went to Sonic, just to be around some lights and people. There were these kids with old riced-out Hondas and stuff lined up, and I was happy to be among these teenagers with questionable aesthetics.

That was it until a week later. My wife was at work late. It was around 9:30PM. Again, I was sitting on the couch in the living room and had by this time poked fun of my little haunting with a few friends. My dogs were asleep. I was screwing around with NetFlix, trying to find something to pass the time. And then I hear the sound, no ringing this time. It was quieter but my brain immediately processes it as the same young female voice.

""Hello.""

I was surprisingly calm and a bit tired this time and thought I'd play a game with my specter or mental manifestation. I said ""What is your name?""

No answer.

I said it again. About five seconds later, I hear ""What........... is............. your........name.....""

Of course this freaked me out again. I panicked and ran out of the house , but I didn't have my keys to the car. I was standing outside by the community mailbox under a light and caught my breath. I didn't want to stay there, and I remembered I had some extra keys downstairs in our laundry room. 

Kind of like when I have to run to my car in the rain, I bolted as fast as possible into my garage entry door, looked through the baskets and boxes in slow motion, and I grabbed the keys and sped away.

I blasted some talk radio and went to Wal-Mart of all places. I spent an hour wandering around and calmed down again, trying to figure out if what I heard was real. I think I joined /r/Paranormal shortly thereafter having never seen it or read it.

I read some stories and saw some REALLY whacky crap and clicked on a few things here and there. I was surprised that there were a lot of serious, well-written comments amid some very bizarre and irrational ramblings.

Last night was the third occurrence and prompted this post. Since the last happening, I have been listening to this Brown noise loop on YouTube with headphones when I study, perhaps to avoid the situation again. I was drawing these ERD diagrams and had just enjoyed some English breakfast tea when I caught a glimpse of a form to my right in my peripheral vision. It wasn't moving but I felt scared. I looked to my left and back again and nothing was there. 

A few minutes later, I went to the kitchen and started rummaging through the pantry looking for snacks and fixed a bowl of Frosted Flakes. I poured in the milk and began to turn around and I see this black silhouette in front of me and I hear the female voice louder and speaking quickly this time. It sounds like ""HE CUT MY HAIR"" or ""HE CUT ME THERE."" 

This time I screamed and dropped the cereal bowl and milk went everywhere. I opened my eyes and nothing was there. I cowered in the corner of the kitchen, shivering wildly, and started sobbing. By this time the dogs had come into the kitchen and were lapping up the milk and wagging their tails.

I pulled myself together and cleaned up the mess, and I couldn't sleep at all. I eventually fell asleep in the living room on the couch with the dogs, after trying to stay awake all night reading Google News articles endlessly.

So what should I do here? Seek professional help immediately? I do take Prozac but I've been taking it for a few years. I drank maybe half a glass of champagne the night before but otherwise, as an ex-binge drinker, I avoid alcohol and drugs.

I have calmed down, but honestly I just don't want this to happen again. I am finishing an online MS degree (in my last class) and I am now a week behind from being unable to study easily since this stuff started. Any advice? Am I losing it? I haven't told anyone about last night yet.

UPDATE: Have not seen/heard anything like this since original post. Buying some high-end mics soon and installing multiple Foscam HD IP cameras as soon as I can afford it just in case. 

UPDATE 2: The mystery tenant pulled up to me while I was unloading groceries the other day. He will be renting a house in the neighborhood in July. Crazy!!!! He just appeared out of nowhere. It was a bit creepy. I did get his phone number, though. I haven't asked him yet if he had any weird experiences while he was here.

I recall my mom and I going to a family outing/picnic out in the woods, the adults were talking amongst themselves and since I was the only child there and bored I decided to explore the area. Nearby was a river and I decided to look at the wildlife, pick up rocks, etc. From a distance I see a big boulder so naturally I decide to walk towards it to climb it. When I get near, however, I see a white silhouette/misty figure in the form of a young lady with long hair sitting on top of the rock (apparently my thought process was that the farther away someone is the more transparent they become..), she had her hands to her face as if she was brushing off some tears and seemed to be sniffling. I could faintly hear her crying and saying something but I couldn't make out what it was. The lady was facing away from me and didn't seem to be noticing me so I walked closer to see if she needed help. I thought that maybe she climbed the rock by herself and needed help getting down so I called out ""do you need help?"" in Spanish but she didn't respond.

I was going to call out again but then I hear my mom calling for me so I turn around and I see my mom signaling for me to get back with the rest of the group, when I look back at the boulder the woman was gone. I asked her if she saw someone on the rock and she said no, I told her I thought I saw someone but didn't pursue it any further because the lady was gone. 

A few years later I'm swapping stories with friends and we are talking about urban myths/spooky stories, etc. They mention the urban myth of ""la llorona"" and how an uncle saw la llorona when he was young, I ask more about the myth and that's when I realize that what I saw when I was in Mexico was the exact same phenomena-it gave me the chills.

I know this is strange, but I wonder, when ""spirits"" scare us is it because it is the only way that they can get our attention?  I offer this example:

One evening when my oldest daughter was about 15, she woke with a feeling of doom.  She saw in the corner a large raven with red eyes.  It morphed into a large dark creature.  She heard it scream and it rushed at her.  She was completely freaked out and ran into my room.  

I was trying to console her when my mother called on the phone.  She was house sitting for my sister.  She told me that she needed me there.  She said she could smell violets, but there was no reason for the smell.  Lights were flickering, and the TV kept turning itself on.  And she had the feeling that she wasn't alone.

So I took both of my daughters with me, because they were scared to be in the house alone.  When I reached the door, the smell of violets was very strong but the air felt electric.  The hair on my neck and arms stood at full attention.  My mom was nervous and was trying to explain all that had happened.  Then I started hearing voices, like a whole classroom was trying to talk at the same time.  I felt like the back of my head was going to explode, and then I passed out.  

Now I know that sounds strange.  But I guess I continued to talk, though I don't remember any of it.  My mom said that I told her I was her Aunt Viola and that she needed to call her sister.  My mom hadn't spoke to her sister since my grandmother's funeral four years prior.  Then I awoke.  The smell was still in the room, but the atmosphere had changed and felt normal.

The next day my mother contacted my aunt.  She had stage 4 breast cancer and died 2 weeks later.  

My daughter did not have any recurrences of the raven after that.  We wonder if it was someone just trying to get our attention when all else failed. ",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_vyk8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/vyk8i/maybe_scary_isnt_a_bad_thing/,

I was at the vets today to get my kitten her second set of vaccines.  She's in training as a therapy animal, so she was on a lead and I was able to carry her around.  One of the other patients was a beagle dog with his owners, a youngish couple and their toddler son.

To describe them, the adults were late 20s/early 30s.  The woman was average height, average weight, blonde and blue eyed with her hair tied into a ponytail.  She wore a purple loose t-shirt and jeans and had a silver bangle on her right wrist.  The man was tall and slim, brunette with a couple days' beard on his chin.  He wore a dark green shirt with a dappled motif on the front and jeans.  The child was blonde, blue eyes wearing a blue t-shirt with fishes on.  He was old enough to walk but not yet old enough to speak.  His parents kept talking to him, saying his name: Charlie.

I live in a small town that's very touristy, so you get to know the locals quite well.  I didn't recognise the couple from the vets, but someone came in with another dog who I knew, and they knew too so there was only 2 degrees of separation between myself and the couple with the child.

A couple hours later I was at work on a check-out, and lo and behold, the couple with Charlie comes to my till.  They're still wearing the same clothes and the only difference in their appearance is that the woman has taken her hair out of the ponytail.  I look up, smiling because I recognise them and ask 'is that Charlie?'  The mother gave me this really edgy stare and slowly says 'yees?' Thinking she's trying to place me, I say 'oh I saw you earlier in the vets; I was the one with the kitten.'  The man and woman looked at each other and say 'we weren't in the vets today.  We've been at the beach all day.'  Shocked, I explain that I saw a child called Charlie who looked like this child with exactly that top on earlier in the day and with parents who looked exactly like this couple.  Only I look closer; the woman's hair is the right colour, but it's too short to have been in ponytail, her eyes are brown and not blue, and the man is ever so slightly taller, but not drastically so.  Other than that they are all wearing the same sort of clothing, the same sort of age, and they had a child the same age with the same name.  They even went on to explain that they too had a beagle dog, but it was up country while they were on holiday.  It was seriously spooky at the time.

It got to my uncle who i don't see much thus i really don't know much about him, and he told me a story that was kind of creepy but very interesting. He started telling us about a time when he and my dad were riding dirt bikes one day on all the dirt roads that surround Abbyville where he lives. In the late 70s there was allot of those around, still are. He went on to say that after a long day of riding all around, they both stopped at there tucks to load my dads bike, who at the time lived in Warner robins Ga, about 45 miles north of where they were. They loaded up the bike and my dad started to drive back home. So at this time the sun is going down pretty fast and sense my uncles bike didn't have lights he wanted to go ahead and get back to the house which was only 3 or 4 miles up the road. 'I started riding down the highway"" he says, when i got to my road and turned on it...his road is basically a big letter ""L"" with one almost 90 degree turn at the center. He said he stopped at the corner to pull out his cigarettes and light one up, while enjoying the view and looking up at the treeline. After burning one he said he noticed an odd shape in the trees and drew it in the dirt for us. The figure he drew had a round head, and its body tapered down into a point where ones feet would go, and that its body was pitch black, its face was the color of the moon when it first rises, and that it had 2 very dark yellow slits where eyes would be. So naturally he freaks out and floors the bike knowing his house is only about a mile away. He told us that no matter how fast he was going, whatever it was, was no more that about 30 yards behind him and hovering about 20 feet in the air. So he pull up to his front door, throws the bike down, runs in the house and starts slamming windows, doors and running to the gun cabinet, which gets his dads attention. His dad yells ""what the hell are you doing"" to which he reply's ""there is something after me, i don't know what it is, and its coming up the yard"". As he finished the sentence he said that there was an incredibly loud sound, just like a jet in full after burn flying maybe 100 feet about the house, then they opened the door.. and it was gone.

1371531591.0,49,self.Paranormal,1gkfoe,Something tried to open my door?,jonssonar,66,17,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1gkfoe/something_tried_to_open_my_door/,"Ok, this happened back in 2001, but I remember it like it was yesterday.  

I was attending college at Western Washington University, and lived by myself in a 1 bedroom apartment on the 2nd floor.  I was getting ready for bed, and closed my bedroom door.  A few moments passed as I collected my thoughts to wind down for sleep.

Suddenly, I noticed the door jiggle by the slightest fraction.  Alerted, I sat bolt upright in bed and strained my ears, making sure not to make a sound myself.  I glanced over at the blinds to see if they had moved, since just a year before there was a minor earthquake and I imagined that we might have had another.  But no, the curtain was still, but again, the door jiggled, almost inaudible.  This time, the door also pulsed slightly in its frame.

At this point, I was sure that it wasn't my imagination.  Seconds pass and now the door is being pressed against *woomp woomp* and stops...

The door handle now jiggles with more tenacity.   Much harder and loudly.  Followed by severe pressing against the door *WOOMP WOOMP!*

From this point on, I was terrified.  No other sound was made from the other side of the door, other than whatever it was that was happening to the door.  

Now the door handle is being handled roughly, and the door is slamming into the door frame *WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM!*  The door sounds like it is being assaulted as it is ferociously hammered upon and the handle sounds like it is being shaken fiercely.

I'm now panicked, my heart is hammering out my my chest, but I am too afraid to do anything but stare in the dark room at the door as it is shaken violently.

Suddenly the noises stop, and there is only silence, which is almost as unnerving.  I sit bolt upright for the next 15 minutes trying not to breathe and straining my ears as hard as humanly possible.

After a few more moments, I muster up the courage to walk to my closet, stop... shuffle as quietly as possible to the closet... stop and listen..and grab a golf club (Kept there because I didn't have any other storage in the apartment).  After another long pause at the bedroom door I listen.  5 minutes pass and still nothing, so I turn the handle as silently as possible, and let it draw open.  The hall is completely black, as is the rest of the apartment.  I slowly shuffle towards the entry door.  Locked, deadbolted, and the door chain still drawn.  All windows in the living room and kitchen are locked and closed.  Remember, this is also on the 2nd floor with no balcony.

The only thing left is the bathroom.  Door shut.  Again, another moment of terror as I approach the door, stop, and listen.  Nothing.  I open the door to an empty and dark bathroom.  The shower curtain is drawn shut.  Damnit, this happens in all of the horror movies right?  I throw it open, and nothing is there.

I turn on all of the lights in the house, inspect everything and can not find a single shred of evidence that any part of the apartment was disturbed or visited.  Unsure of what to do, I sit in the living room for 30 minutes or so, and decide to return to my bedroom to try to sleep.  This time with the door open, and golf club nearby.

To this day I still get goosebumps thinking about it, and my spine crawls.  Furthermore, I am incredibly thankful that my bedroom door never opened when whatever it was that happened...happened.

When I watched the movie Paranormal Activity, I almost jumped out of my seat during the ""door opening"" scene, and thought to myself, ""Holy sh*t, THAT is what happened!!""

Anyway, glad to have found this subreddit to share my story!

*Edit:  Does anyone have a similar experience, or thoughts as to what it might have been? Also, I didn't want to add this part, since it is most likely irrelevant and could sound cheesy, but being in college I of course had a black light, and observed a stain in the white bedroom carpet, which could not be detected via normal light.  I only discovered it when I was moving out months later, and I had shifted my bed frame to take it apart.  That evening I was clearing out the closet, found the black light, plugged it in, and found the stain.  In terms of size, no more than a cups worth of ""liquid"" or whatever it was...

I moved here to pursue acting and the soundboard job is part of an acting apprenticeship that I have at the theatre. My job is to sit in the booth overlooking the stage and run all of the sound ques during the performance. It is just me running the sound ques, and my stage manager running the light ques in the booth during the show. We wear headsets in order to communicate quietly but still hear one another. Because of the construction of the booth and its distance from the stage, it is nearly impossible to hear the show well over the sound of the audience, but we need to be able to hear the actors in order to know when to take each que. The solution to this problem is a small microphone that hangs from the light grid above the stage that is fed to a small monitor inside the booth. Keep in mind that the microphone is HANGING FROM THE CEAILING; it is important later. 

So, we were just running the show as usual, and everything was going perfect until we get to a particularly funny scene in the play. The audience was really into it; laughing, clapping, and screaming their approval. As a result, the actors on stage had to project quite loudly in order to be heard. Needless to say, it was deafening in our booth with all of that sound flooding through the little monitor. Then, out of no ware, clear as a bell, cutting through all of the other racquet, we both hear a young, scared, female voice clearly say ""mommy, mommy, are you there? It's me. Mommy?"" 

This went on long enough for both my stage manager and I to register the sound, look at one another, and for me to take off my headset to make sure it wasn't someone on another headset backstage. My first thought was that someone was talking on a cell phone in the audience right beside the mike, and that's why it was so much louder than all of the other sounds. But then I realized that the mike is in the light grid, at least 12 feet away from the actors and audience. Someone, or something, was right beside that mike, speaking into it. My stage manager missed the next light que.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1360895444.0,,,True,t3_18i0jg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18i0jg/i_just_had_the_most_visceral_paranormal/,

I believe I witnessed the same creature/being twice within a few days to a week of each other in my town.  I’ll begin with the first sighting I had.**

I live in a nice suburb of metro Detroit.  There aren’t many large animals in the area, aside from deer.  The only other animals in the area are your typical pets, squirrels, and an occasional fox or two for the most part.  It’s pretty a pretty tame area.

I was driving through the neighborhood leaving my girlfriend’s around midnight last summer.  As I was driving north on a street in the subdivision, something caught my eye from the very left edge of my field of view.  It appeared to be a very large and well-built creature, hurtling from a backyard (on the grass) and into the street.  I slammed on my brakes immediately in disbelief at what I was witnessing.

It was moving EXTREMELY fast.  I don’t have a very good estimate, but I would say at least 40-50mph.  The yard in which it emerged from was directly facing a short cul-de-sac that backed up to some trees and then more houses beyond that.

I immediately turned right facing the court, so that my headlights would illuminate the path it seemed to be running.  I was only able to witness it for a few more seconds, but I have no doubt in my mind that whatever I witnessed was real.

The creature was very large.  If I had to compare the size to another animal, I’d say it was about the size of an adult lion.  The body type appeared to be that of a dog, although I’ve never seen any breed of dog this size (and there are absolutely no wild/stray dogs in the area).  It had a pitch black coat and while I could make slightly make out the shape of its head from the side, I never saw its eyes or mouth.

When it ran past my headlights initially, it never acknowledged my presence.  It did not turn and look at me, slow down, or do anything that was directed toward me.  When I turned facing the court, I was only able to see the back of the creature before it disappeared into the backyard of the center house on the court and into the woods.  

Determined to get a better look, I drove recklessly (40+ mph) out of the court and around the bend to the street in which the yard would back up to, but it was already gone.  I continued to drive home and tell my girlfriend about what I had seen.  With no explanation, I kind of shrugged it off as just being a very unusual night.


**Now, this is what I believe was my second encounter with what I’m guessing was a hellhound.**


I don’t remember exactly how many days later it was, probably about a week, but I went to smoke a cigarette outside my house around midnight.  I typically go out through my garage and smoke on the side of my house next to the garage.  I put on my shoes and walked through my laundry room to the garage door (it’s an attached garage).

As I stepped into my garage, I had a very “bad” feeling overtake me.  It’s the type of feeling you get when you think you’re being watched or stalked.  The hairs on my neck and arms stood up and I felt a very eerie, sinking feeling in the bottom of my stomach.  I paused, stood completely still, not breathing, to assess the situation.  A few seconds passed and I heard and saw nothing.  I looked over to my right to see that the side door was completely shut, but something still did not feel right.

There are two vehicles that stay parked in my garage that are for summer driving only.  I look around and still don’t see or hear anything.  Then, out of what seemed like nowhere, the furthest vehicle from me begins to shake.  I immediately think, “oh, it’s just a cat,” but then I realize that there’s no way any house cat in my neighborhood could cause the vehicle to move like that.  That’s when it went from scary to absolutely frightening.

As the car is shaking, I hear the most horrific sound I probably will ever hear in my entire life.  It sounded like an extremely deep growl mixed with high, alternating pitches of screeching all at the same time.  The noise hit me at the deepest, most primal level and struck a level of fear I’ve never experienced. Even when I’ve faced life or death situations (held up at gun point), I’ve never felt this feeling. 

It was deafeningly loud and the vehicle began to shake even more.  The noise was more horrifying than anything Hollywood could dream up.  It sounded like whatever it was, was warning me to leave, but then began to get angered at my presence.  I was too afraid to stay any longer and immediately slammed the door into my house and locked both locks.  I put a note on the door telling my brother to go out the front in the morning, as there’s SOMETHING in the garage and it’s extremely agitated.

I ended up calming down and going to sleep without really worrying about it.  When I woke up, I saw my note and kind of laughed at myself for being so afraid.  I went out through the front door and walked around to the side of my garage.  The door was still shut.  I sighed and decided that it was daylight, there was nothing to be afraid of.

I opened the door away from me very quickly.  Before I could blink, a pitch black creature SPRINTED out of the door.  This time, it was not as large as my initial encounter, but moved faster than any animal I’ve ever seen in person (sans the other encounter).  It appeared to be the size of a medium-large sized dog (~75lbs), but the speed in which it was moving is inconsistent with any dog.  Again, it seemed to be moving over 40-50mph, allowing me only to see it for a few seconds before it was over 50 yards from me disappearing into the woods.

Again with the second encounter, it never looked at me.  I never got a glimpse of its face or its eyes.  I never stopped to think that what I had seen might have been paranormal until today. When I searched the description, I was horrified to see it matched that of a hellhound.

It seems the mythology behind these creatures is a bit contradicting (omen of death, nothing may occur, or possibly a protector), but now I’m worried I’ll encounter it for a third time.  I always felt it was unusual that it never looked at me, but now I’m thankful that it seemed to consciously choose not to.  Folklore says that if it looks you in the eyes three times, it’s a guaranteed omen of death.

So now here I am and I don’t know what to think.  I feel confident that if this was a hellhound, it was not looking for me, but I don’t know that for sure.  Does anyone have more insight into what it could have been and what this means for me?  Is there any reason to be concerned?  Also, if it was able to manifest itself in the garage, why did it need me to physically let it out?  

Let me know your thoughts.

I was playing outside and had consumed far too much water and played far too hard. I needed to run inside to go to the bathroom. The bathroom was dark but at the time I was never the one to run from dark places so I just left the door open for a bit of light (don't want to pee on the seat). While I was going to the bathroom, I had this most horrible feeling of dread behind me. It came out of nowhere and I slowly turned to look.

Behind me was the shower but nothing was on or near it as far as I could tell. I turned my head back and saw a shadow of what I thought was me on the front of the toilet and wall. It seemed to have a top hat and appeared to be lanky. I stopped as to reassure myself it was just me but the shadow continued to sway. It appeared much taller than I was and just seemed to observe me. I bolted out of the bathroom as fast as I could and told my family. They, of course, looked at each other and told me there is no top hatted man watching me.

Years later I asked them about it again and they told me about how they had experiences with this shadow entity but did not want to scare me as a kid.

Anyways, around me working there for 2 months, weird stuff started happening, my room would be a mess even though the door was locked and the room cleaned before i left for work, weird noises from parts of the house, loud thumps from under the floor, we lived on a 2nd floor apartment and nobody lived under us till last month, and the most important part was when my moms room mate was by herself in their room, nobody was in the house cause it was around school time, and she heard some noise coming from our side of the apartment, she opened her door and saw a pale white woman, with a white dress, I don't remember the details quite clearly but she said the lady had no face, then the apparition just levitated to the restroom in our side and a lot of noise came from there, like the toilet flushing, or just the stuff under our sink being tossed around.

After her encounter with this 'ghost' I was alone in my room, this was about 3 weeks after the room mate incident, and suddenly the temperature dropped, I let it slip cause I though the A/C turned on, and I went to get a drink from the fridge, when I turned around I saw what my mom's room mate saw, this woman, who white hair but very young, and wasnt touching the floor, cause she had no feet, after about what I assume was 5 seconds she disappeared, and I went ape-shit scared and ran to my mom.

Our house was a fairly new build, 5 years old, on a housing estate in Cheshire. There was no creepy back story to the house, no horrible things had happened there and it wasn't built on a graveyard which makes what happened to me all the more frightening in my mind.

It was summer and my parents and their friends had gone up to the leisure club up the road for drinks, it was about a ten minute walk away and they'd be home some time around 1, it was a usual occurrence and I wasn't too worried.

My evening went fine, my sister had gone to bed when she was meant to and I had been sat downstairs until 11 or so browsing the net and chatting to my friends. I decided it was bed time and went through my nightly ritual of checking all the downstairs doors and windows with the family dog at my side, noting everything was locked up and making sure I had left the outside and the landing light on I went and checked on my sister, closing all the other doors on the floor before getting ready for bed.

This is where shit started to get weird.

I had bunk beds at that time and slept on the lower bunk so I could sleep with my dog, I had just gotten under the blanket and he had settled down on my legs when I heard a creak from the landing. I heaved the dog off my legs and went and checked outside my door thinking it was my sister who was prone to night time wandering.

The landing was empty.

I checked on my sister, she was flat out, snoring and in a very deep sleep. I put the creak down to the heat of the day and the house settling and went and got back in to bed, shutting my door. Again the creak. I ignored it and lay back against my pillows, only to jerk back up again when the creak became two, then three then... it was footsteps. A bit freaked out and nudged the dog, trying to push him off the bed to see if it was my parents, he'd snuffle at my door whenever they came home. He wouldn't get off the bed and backed into the corner.
This entire time the footsteps had been treading a steady path in the hall. From the stairs to my parents room, back up to my sisters room, across to the spare room. I started holding my breath and stared at the crack under my door which showed the hall light, the footsteps approached and then stopped. There was the kind of silence you get when someone is waiting to see if you're awake or not, but as far as I could tell, there was no shadow... no one was outside my door. I called out but there was no answer.

I sat there quietly freaking out, I knew I had to go check on my sister but there was someone in our house. Eventually I went out and went through the entire house, flicking on every light and double checking every door, window and cupboard as I dragged the dog around by his collar.

Nothing. I let the dog go back to hiding in my room and checked on my sister again, she was still spark out, I said her name quietly and she didn't even twitch - it wasn't her. I went back to bed and sat there, waiting. The footsteps started again, this time at each door on the landing there was a pause followed by a click as the door was opened and shut. Once again the footsteps got to my room and stopped, waiting. I stayed in my room the rest of the night absolutely terrified, as soon as my parents got home I ran out to them and garbled the story 

""Oh, omikone, don't be silly it was nothing.""

It happened every single time they went out after that, including one time when someone else was with me, she was convinced that a person was in the house, especially as that time the doors downstairs started to slam shut too. It got to the point where I would never mention it in the house itself, even my mother wouldn't talk to me about it in the house which made me think she'd had something happen to her too.

I've had other experiences that I couldn't quite explain, but this shook me up the most, especially considering that the damn dog didn't want to leave the room.

My wife and I have each lived in our current home once before: my wife with her family several years ago, and me from March '11 through August '12. 

While her family lived here, they experienced odd happenings that they jokingly attributed to a ghost. They eventually named this ghost Linda, and to this day still discuss Linda as if she were a real person. When I moved into the house in 2011 they jokingly warned me about Linda, but I never experienced anything I would call paranormal. 

As fate would have it, the wife and I ended up back in the house together when we exchanged vows earlier this year. I moved in first, and she followed suit a few weeks later. After I had been in the house for about a month, electrical appliances all over the house started dying. Naturally, I called in an electrician but he said that there were no issues with any wiring or the like. Just bad luck, I thought. It was around that time the wife started having bad insomnia and nightmares when she could actually fall asleep, though she could never remember what they were about. She also started joking about Linda more often since she is paranoid at night and likes to try and lighten the mood for herself, going so far as to actually talk to Linda for minutes at a time.

Everything eventually returned to some semblance of normality until last week, when the dryer died. The wife's nightmares and insomnia returned, and so did the talking with Linda. I finally asked where the name came from, and she said that she had arbitrarily named the ghost Linda. Then she shared a story that I hadn't heard before. Sometime after naming Linda while she was living in the house with her family, they received a letter addressed to Linda [their last name]. Now, that's a huge coincidence, isn't it? Mail ends up at the wrong addresses all the time, and companies will sometimes misname recipients, but to receive a letter at the correct address for a person matching the name of an arbitrarily named imaginary ghost is to much. 

It doesn't end there, though. I sat down last night and listed all the appliances that have suddenly died and was startled to realize that they were all mine, and that electrical armageddon had begun the week my wife moved in.

Three friends and I decided to go to the same college and live together. We found this awesome complex that had six bedroom apartments for college students. 
So we all drove our stuff down there and moved in, it was roughly 400 miles from where we lived so we moved in one day. 
After we moved in my friends decided to meet up with this girl we knew but I needed to shower so they said they'd go and meet up and then have everyone come over. 
Everyone left and I got in the shower. I got out and noticed the hall and kitchen lights we on. I usually turn lights off during the day so it was odd but I though oh I just forgot to turn then off. So I went in my room and was just surfing the Internet. I kept getting this strange feeling that someone was behind me in my doorway looking at me. I would look back and see nothing. The feeling kept coming and was getting worse and started to freak me out pretty bad. I decided just to go sit by the pool and wait for my friends. 
They came back and they said the girls were coming later that night. So we goofed around waiting for them. I told them about earlier, they just laughed and said I was just a baby because my mom wasn't there. 
Anyway the girls show up and one of them gets out of the car and just quickly walks away without saying anything. The other two came in and said when they pulled up she just said she had to go for a walk and that she seemed pretty upset. 
We are are hanging out and having a good time and after an hour the girl that ha walked away showed up. She had obviously been crying. We asked her what's wrong? She said why did they let you move in to this apartment? We just said well because it was empty and we had money! She said no, I really can't believe they let you move in? She started crying again. We kept asking her why she was crying and why she kept asking that. She just sat there for a second and said, my ex boyfriend killed himself in that room (pointed to the room that was across the hall from mine). None of us believed her. It really freaked me out though because of what happened to me earlier. She just said look him up. So we did. Found a facebook paige for his funeralTurns out he was a marine and had PTSD. She told us that she got sick of it and broke up with him. He called her one night crying and asked if she still loved him. She said no. She heard a gunshot.
We were all freaked out. We stayed at a friends house that night and went back the next day. I was on my computer messaging someone about it. Right when I was typing about him killing himself, my computer screen went white and stayed like that for a few seconds and then tuned black. Needless to stay I freaked out and slammed my laptop shut.  We went to the front office and demanded a new apartment. They confirmed the story and said they'd gladly give us a new place. 
Still freaks me out thinking of it.
Sorry this was so long! 

TL;DR: marine killed himself in my apartment.

Edit: we were the first ones to move in after he killed himself in there. We moved in roughly 2 to 3 months after he did.  ",Haunting,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1366580216.0,e,,True,t3_1ctja8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ctja8/first_night_at_college_something_paranormal/,

So, to start off, my family has been somewhat into this new age sort of thing since my baby sister passed away in 2004. This sort of thing doesn't necessarily scare me now, but the recent happenings have been very strange, I will now elaborate. 

Ever since I was a little boy my dad's mom (gramma), who has lived out of town always came to visit at Christmas, she passed away in early 2012 from cancer, therefore that Christmas felt empty without her. Instead of having her, we had my mom's side of the family to our house for a massive party. My whole family, especially my dad was pretty upset except it was nice to have something to do on Christmas day to keep our minds off of everything. After our big party at about midnight (technically the 26th then) people were leaving so me and my dad started to clean up, he was hammered. At about 2 am I went downstairs to bed. Seeing as my bedroom is in the basement I can hear where people are in my house when they walk, and I heard my dad on the other end of the house in the kitchen clumsily cleaning up. 

This is where things start to get a little weird. Just keep in mind, that the only people are awake are me and my dad, who is in the kitchen cleaning. 

I was lying in bed, and my mind started to drift to thoughts of gramma and how sad Christmas is without her, then I begin hearing a strange, inconsistent ticking outside my door. Not directly outside, just somewhere outside my room, with my door latched shut. Now, all houses make noise sometimes so I brushed it off as nothing. But every time I brushed it off it got more prominent, so I began to get a little anxious and freaked out. I said outloud ""Gramma, stop it"" and right as I said that I didn't hear any ticking for the rest of the night and haven't heard it since. I brushed this off as a strange coincidence. Anyways, my room did have a bit of a draft but that night I was especially warm, so my blankets weren't on. But all of a sudden I feel a very cool air pass over my body for about 2 seconds, gone as quick as it came. Again, brushed off as a coincidence, however, I had all of my blankets on after that. 

This is where things start to get really weird. 

I was on one side of my bed, and all of a sudden I felt such a strong physical feeling that even my blankets moved, as if someone was in bed next to me rolled over and got out of bed. I spun over and flung my arm around to hit whatever intruder my mind assumed this was. Nothing. 

It must be my dog, she sometimes sleeps with me. But shes not in my bed, must be under the bed or on the floor. 

I turn on my lights and search the room high and low, the dog is nowhere to be found. Now this is really strange, I decide to just go to bed and the next morning ill tell my mom, who will most likely be able to explain all these occurences to me in the morning. 

Now, this is where things get REALLY weird. 

I was laying in bed and it was about 2:30 AM, and I can hear my dad cleaning up in the kitchen still. My eyes are closed, and all of a sudden I just bolt my eyes open, that happens a lot when people sleep, I didn't sit up, I didn't move, just opened my eyes. My door, which was shut and latched (as in you'd have to turn the handle to open it) suddenly swung open. Not just opened, but swung right open. I literally just stare, paralyzed in fear at this unexplainable physical occurence. 

After about a minute, I call for my dad. Who, drunk, stumbled downstairs, and walks in my room. He has no clue whats going on and the next morning hardly remembers it. I tried explaining it but he just bumbled off about nonesense, shut my door, and went to bed. 

The next morning I was so amazed, I called my cousin who is pretty intuitive with this sort of thing. She seemed to think it wasn't gramma or my late baby sister, but something else trying to get ahold of me. I thought this nonsense. 

Fast forward to Janurary 8th. 

My immediate family (dad, mom, sister, me) went to Mexico. We've been here about a week. My mom finds some book in the condo we're renting about angels, and right once it's opened it says ""if this is in your hands right now, someone or something has put it there for a reason"". Interesting. It's full of stories about angels and new age things and such, you get the drift. She's attached to this book so whatever. That evening, I go to bed. My sister and I have to share a bedroom, but whatever. Due to a lack of power outlets I have to go to the washroom to plug in my Iphone. I plug it in to charge and go to bed, with no thought of spirits or anything paranormal in my mind. 

The next morning I wake up, i'm just out on the patio with my mom going through my phone and I notice that, strangely enough, I have over 200 more photos. I go through this and see that in the middle of my night, my phone took over 200 photos and videos, randomly. It was locked before. 

Not only did it take photos AND videos, in a random sequence. Some photos have flash on and some don't. The ones with flash just reveal the ceiling of the bathroom. Not only that, some are zoomed in, some aren't. In a random order. And strangely enough, one is panoramic. I don't even know how to activate panoramic photos on my phone. 

I go through every photo and listen to every video (the videos are just dark with some noise), the video length ranges from 1 second, to over a minute. Keep in mind that my phone was locked and charging in the bathroom with the door shut and two rooms over from anyone. So I listen to every single one of the ~85 videos (there were more pictures), some have strange and infrequent tickings, and the most prominent one has a strange ""moan"" almost, I was able to get that video on my computer, it's saved as a .mov file, I will post it if somebody PM's me or comments how to. 

Anyways, after I went through all of these, my mom was convinced it was gramma or baby sister. But then it got really strange. 


I had about 450 photos before, after going through all of those, my total photo count was 666. 

I was freaked out, even though i'm not very religious. My mom said that spirits like to point out to you their prescence by showing double numbers (ex. you look at the clock at 11:11) my mom seemed to think that that was all that it was. 

That evening, my mom's dad, my grandfather, passed away suddenly from a heart failure. 

I'm not sure if that was a sign or anything, but i've hardly gotten any noteworthy to say since then, seeing as arranging the funeral and such has been very hectic. But if anyone could point me in the direction of anything like this, any theories just anything.

Over the 18 years i worked there i have seen or heard some strange stuff most of them upon applying science and logic were just some natural happening . but one has me stunned i have been trying to figure it out for almost a year now . i should also explain it is a 10 story building with 200 apts  built around 1921 I'm sure if the walls could talk we would hear some interesting stuff. As far as me I'm 50% open mined and 50% skeptic  but wanted to share my ordeal of what occurred  so that maybe someone had a similar experience or can explain this.

Around the holidays the building seems to have a high energy I can feel it  I 'm not sure about anyone else but i can . Shortly after the new year our building was installing a new passenger elevator . Right next to that is a freight elevator that has to be operated by pulling a big lever and due to the age of it and it being easy to get it stuck only our employees are allowed to operate it. That being said  the janitorial daylight guys took shifts to man it 24 hrs a day in case of a medical emergency and to take tenants up the 10 stories.  They kinda moved in to the  elevator  by adding a chair and a make shift table by stacking 2 plastic milk crates together.

One evening while taking a smoke break in the basement a co-worker came down and said the freight elevator is making strange noises so i went up for a ride to listen...what i heard was nothing more than normal wear and tear from the increased use. So i told him i would leave a message for the elevator company  to check it as they would be in the next morning to continue work on the new install. 
It was then i noticed my co-worker had a styrofoam food box on the milk crates I asked what he was eating and he said chicken wings but  it was just bones because he already ate them all ...I thanked him for offering me one (sarcastic) and told him to return me to the basement so i could finish my smoke break. What happens next is in a bout 2 seconds of time.

When we reached the basement i open the 2 metal doors to exit the elevator one foot is on the concrete outside the elevator the other still in the elevator when suddenly the elevator shakes violently i turned to look at my co-worker who is looking up and then moves his head in a downward motion  as if he is following something with his eyes  then a loud popping noise as if someone blew up a plastic bag with air and burst it.  the scary part is my co-worker then pointed to his strofoam food box and was  repeating oh my god 5-6 times before freaking out and saying I'm  going home ...i wanna get out of here .upon inspecting the styrofoam box the hair on my neck stood up dead in the center of it was a hand print  as if it had been burned into it (like a hand shaped iron was pressed on it) I know it was not like that before  and apparently my co-worker knew it also . 

There has been no strange activity in that area of the building since then . And i have conducted several experiments  including pressing my hand down on one of those styrofoam food boxes and then putting it in a pressure cooker but could not get the same effect .i was thinking a pressure differential may have caused it but I'm still stumped ..If anyone has any input I'm all ears

I was very young, around the age of 5-7, and had snuck out of bed to go downstairs and watch television. Don't know what programs I would've been watching at that age, but I had been happily sitting in the recliner watching TV when I saw a shadow pass over the TV screen from right to left. It wasn't part of the show I was watching, and the size of the shadow was as if an adult had just walked in front of the television, just passing by it. There was no light source that could've created this shadow as the only thing on was the television. And there definitely wasn't anyone else in the room with me at the time.

I don't recall being frightened, just kind of confused thanks to the naivety of being a kid. Looked around the room, even looked behind me and out the large glass pane windows into the yard to make sure it wasn't a burglar or a strange man walking around. That's another thing, it was the form of a man.

Eventually, my aunt who was staying over came out to the living room and asked why I was awake and why I wasn't in bed, so I turned off the TV and went back upstairs.

Has anyone else had similar experiences? I remember this so clearly it was definitely not just imaginary or a ""fake memory"".",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_11dh61,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11dh61/has_anyone_else_experienced_shadows_passing_by/,

I consider myself a science-loving, knowledgeable, reasonable atheist, but to this day i have not come up with any other explanation for this than the supernatural. I was 8 and my little brother, who we'll call sam, was 6. It was a rough time for my mom. She had just had my little sister 3 months earlier and was still breast-feeding. It was june, and just a few weeks earlier my great-grandmother, my mom's maternal grandmother, had passed away. My great-grandma was the daughter of italian immigrants and was extremely religious and superstitious. She completely believed in all the catholic saints, witches, and all these other 'bad omens.' this is part of the reason i think this experience happened with her. My mom was sitting in our living room, breast-feeding my little sister. She was by herself, as she wanted some time to just decompress because she was having sort of a rough day with her emotions. Our living room was the first room you would walk into from the front door, so there were plenty of windows to see outside. From where she was sitting, she could pretty much see right up our walkway to the front door. All of a sudden, she started hearing a very faint knocking on our front door. She listened hard, but then it stopped. She passed it off as trees outside or maybe some of us kids attempting a lame 'ding-dong-ditch.' but, if that had been the case, she would have seen us walk up the walkway, right? then, she heard it again. She was sure this time. She called me and 'sam' into the room. She said 'guys, be really quiet. I think i heard someone knocking on the door. Tell me if you hear it too.' sure enough, we heard it- an extremely faint, but unmistakeable knocking on the door. Once we heard it a few more times, my mom stood up. She went to the door, opened it, and in a choked-up voice said 'grandma, if you're there, come in.' she stepped back and left the door open for a few seconds. There was a light breeze that came through and, oddly enough, had a faint whiff of 'old-lady perfume'- you know the kind im talking about. However, this could have just been the scent of the flowering trees in our yard, but... you can't assume anything now. We had to shut the door then because our indoor cat would try to run outside at any chance he got, but we opened a window. After that, there was no more knocking. My mom said for the rest of the day she didn't hear anything else, and strangely enough was put into a better mood, not feeling so down-in the dumps like she was earlier. I didnt really think anything of it then, but as i get older this experience has stuck with me. Not in a scary, creepy way, but just as a sort of memory that i cant explain. Kind of comforting, actually. Just thought i'd share it with you all :)",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_twoh5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/twoh5/my_one_and_only_experience_with_the_supernatural/,

1372853381.0,48,self.Paranormal,1hk94u,The stories thread for people who have had crazy shit happen to them but were on something....,jotarowinkey,60,12,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1hk94u/the_stories_thread_for_people_who_have_had_crazy/,"I used to smoke pot in my teens. Haven't for 8 years due to drug tests in the military and at my new job. 

Some weird shit happened to me one night and if I were to talk about it in a regular paranormal story post, it would get downvoted to oblivion because noone would read it, but to me, these stories have value.

A list of reasons why:


1, Paranormal occurences that apply directly to the drugs you were on and theories about why.

Example: ""back in the days when acid was made in college labs and it was pure, i did some and there was this glowing guy walking down the street. i saw him glowing when he was away from light sources because it was night. he kept pausing and starting at me and i was pausing and staring at him. i went into a store for some orange juice and he followed me. we tried to avoid each other in the store and we kept eyeing each other. eventually we both went to the counter with our purchases. he looked at me and said, ""dude! you glow!""

""I said, ""dude you glow too!""""

""We looked at each other and at the same time we said, ""The acid with the pyramid and the eye with a teardrop on it!""""

My stepdad swears by this story.


2, Your state of mind could attract the paranormal

Come on. I know a lot of people here believe that if you think about paranormal stuff it's like opening a door for them to enter your life and if you want it to go away then you should stop thinking about them. Furthermore, drugs make you EXTREMELY open-minded or they can induce a trancelike state. 


3, You are situationally more prone to paranormal experiences while on drugs.

When I went to smoke weed, I didn't tell anyone where I was going. We would go to secluded private places. We were the accidental mystery machine. We'd drive around to abandoned farmhouses, the woods, just long drives in general in places we had no legit business and they were new places we'd never been to or hung around at.


4, Your word about what happened means nothing.

You were high. That means no one will believe you. Convenient for an entity that wants no one to believe you. Relevant to my story.


So that's my list of reasons. I understand that credibility is lost. I still think it's worth talking about. Most stories on /r/paranormal don't have credibility no matter how cool they may seem and even if evidence is posted, its usually not credible... So let's just enjoy ourselves and share cool stories that we know happened to us even though we can't prove. 

And even though we can't prove them, from stoner to stoner, we may find some correlation between stories about drugged paranormal experiences. Wouldn't it be cool if we could find patterns about this kind of thing that we wouldn't normally be aware of because normally we don't tell our stories for lack of credibility?


Heres my story.

Me and 3 high school buddies live in Vancouver, WA. Friday and we all go to smoke weed in my buddy's mom's minivan. We have an underweight bag of weed we bought for 20 bucks. This is our weekend ritual. We go somewhere and smoke weed till like 4 in the morning. We are veteran stoners. 

On this day, we left at 10 pm. It's a 20 minute drive to this park that's basically a small beach that becomes private property. It's a very wooded area on the way there.

We are driving and we hear this wierd high pitched noise. We are on a secluded road surrounded by trees. The noise goes off an on. Everybody hears it. No discernable pattern. Its not any louder when the windows are rolled down and it's not coming from the speakers.

We finally get there. Its a beach spot 20 feet from a parking lot, next to some train tracks. We each take only one hit.

Suddenly without discussion, we all get up and start walking back to the car. I vaguely remember being annoyed with the change of plans but I don't voice anything, like it didn't even occur to me to say, ""what the heck!""

We are driving back and the high pitched noise keeps coming and going. Not fading in and out but loud or not there. 

We get to a stoplight. We wait at this stoplight for like 10 minutes. We all are bitching about how long this stoplight is taking, getting really angry.

The radio turns on. It cycles through all the channels. The digital clock, which was already wrong is acting like someone is setting it forward. We all see this and are like, ""woah! do you fucking see that!"" all of us.

The high pitched noise comes back and the light finally turns green.

we're all quiet again. my friend drops us off and none of us complain about the wierd fact that we didn't plan on driving for 40 minutes just to take one hit of weed.

i go in my room. i look at my alarm clock. it's like 3:30AM. 

ok... 10pm plus 40 minutes plus 5 minutes smoking on the beach... does not equal 3:30AM.

i call my friends the next day. they all confirm the same thing happened.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1hk94u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1hk94u/the_stories_thread_for_people_who_have_had_crazy/,

Well, before I go any further, the legend behind the creek is this; a lady drowned her newborn kid in the river because daddy didn't want it or he runs off with another woman, so after the lady drowns her baby, she screams in anguish or something. So now she haunts the creek and there are said to be sightings of her today. Well, my friend and I go down there just for shits and giggles, on a Saturday night. We're having a grand ol' time, just wandering around by the water, when we decide to cross the street into the little wooded area on the other side. There's a small trail on that side of the road, and we followed it probably six feet before stopping for whatever reason. My best friends looking up the road while I'm facing the nature stuff in the opposite direction. I hear this odd little chirping noise, and I just blew it off as a bat or something fucking around in the bushes, when suddenly, my friend sees a light up the road. So I turn and look, and sure enough, there's a  glow of light stationary over the incline. But the light wasn't followed by a car, and there was no other possible explanation for the light. A few seconds later, the light was gone. Okay, it's just a light, whatever. Nothing to shit yourself over. But we decide to leave just in case things got weird. Well, right before our shoes were off of the trail and onto the pavement, we hear the most terrible noise two adventurous nearly full grown people could hear. Out of fucking left field comes this crazy mix of cackling/screeching/loud fucking I don't even know. It sounded fucking furious. And I shit you not, no living critter could have made that noise. Needless to say, we booked it back to the truck, but it felt like we couldn't run fast enough, like it feels when you run in a dream. So we're screaming and laughing in fear as we're driving out of those tight roads as fast as they'd let us, when all of a sudden, this white mist is going through the fucking trees and across the road in front of the truck. It wasn't any kind of reflection, this shit was mist. Through the fucking trees. And right in front of the truck. After that, we went to Sonic and got the biggest vanilla raspberry coke's we could handle, and took about half an hour reevaluating all aspects of life as we knew it.

If you want to read another one of my experiences, you could go check out ""Fear Cage""

I live up here in Washington, and so does my older brother and his family. Just this August, my boyfriend and his son went on vacation to Mexico to visit my boyfriend's family. I couldn't go this year because I had to start school early. We live in an apartment with another guy, and I felt a little uncomfortable living with him alone for a month, so I decided to bunk with my brother and his family who have PLENTY of room in their 6 bedroom house. 

Enough backstory...

The first day I stepped into his house to help him get the house livable when they had initially bought it, I felt a spirit. I never said anything because I didn't want to freak them out/seem crazy. Plus, it wasn't a bad feeling. I felt it most keenly in one particular bedroom upstairs that was painted purple. I spent alot of time in that room fixing it up and ripping up carpet, and always felt like there was some one in there with me. I always looked behind me because I thought someone was in the room with me, but there was never anyone. Made me uneasy, but not an evil feeling, just the feeling of being watched by curious eyes.

Anyway, this thought was in my mind when I stayed with them. They had me stay in the room next to it, as the purple room was their oldest daughters' room. I felt it all the time. Downstairs, upstairs, walking around, and especially walking down the hallway upstairs I would get fear cage very strongly, very dizzy, and get goosebumps. It started to really freak me out. I felt like the feeling followed me and was always behind me. I was getting super freaked. 

One day, Sonia (my sister-in-law) and I are downstairs watching T.V. Suddenly she mutes the sound and listens. I frown and look at her and say ""what?"". She points up to the ceiling and I listen. There's something... walking? Thumping... walking, creaking and making noises? I said ""Is it Luna or Raven?"" (the daughters)  She said ""No, this is crawl space that you can only get to from the garage. The upstairs ends that the door jam over there"" (and she points backward from our position about 10 feet) Then I got that fear cage feeling again. 

She begins to talk about how the house is legit haunted. She said they noticed it only about a year ago, when she would hear walking upstairs where we were sitting. She repeatedly had my brother go up to see if there was a family of critters up there, but there was never an animal, or signs of animals. Creepy enough. She told me another story of how her and Aaron (my brother) were home alone with their 1 year old son (Max), and Sonia was supposed to be having a conference call with one of her bosses. Aaron went into another room so she could have her conference, but in about 15 minutes he went back into the room and says ""Oh  my god, are you okay?"" She looks at him and says ""What the hell are you talking about?"" He says ""You were crying... did something happen with the call?"" She said ""No, the call got cancelled, we never even had it."" They went and checked on Max who was sleeping upstairs, and sure enough, he was still sleeping soundly. 

Getting weirder now... But she keeps telling me stories. She talks about feelings that people are standing next to her while she's sleeping, and noises downstairs in the middle of the night. People walking upstairs when no one else is home, etc. One of the creepier stories she told me was of one night she was sleeping, and she had her baby walkie talkie thing on her night stand. She starts to hear Max wake up and cry a little. Suddenly ""It's okay baby, don't cry"" comes over ever so quietly, but it does. She said it was a little girl's voice and she flipped her bucket and high-tailed it into Max's room, where there was only him crying a little bit in his crib. 

So they end up talking to neighbors who have been there since the house was built, and ask if anyone had passed away in the house. That was all that was said. The old man neighbor says ""Oh, the first family who lived there and also built the house had a little girl named Nicole. She died at the Childrens Hospital in Seattle with Spina Bifida.""

I'm flippin' shit by this time that she is telling me this. This is alot of activity. I told her how some of my things were moved, and the curtains are always a little open when I go upstairs to my room (even though I close them, every day), and that one day I went up stairs and the closet doors were open (mind you, these are the sliding 'accordion' style doors, so they don't just accidentally come open). Makes me uncomfortable, I tell her. And now there's a name for the ghost.. Nicole? She said to not worry, she 'talked' to her, and she's okay. I said ""How did you talk to a ghost?""

She starts to tell this story: So she downloads this app on her iphone that reads changes in EMF's. She thought it was something silly, downloaded it and never thought to use it. One day while no one was home, she was watching TV in the same room as where we are at talking, and she hears the footsteps again. She decided to see if her app 'works', and puts it on the sofa next to her and she says out loud, ""Nicole, why don't you come and sit next to me on my couch?"" And this app comes up with 'words' that it 'feels' in the EMF, also. Now, the phone says ""Mine, mine"". Sonia says ""Okay, it can be yours,too. But let me tell you, you are welcome here. But you have to be nice, we only accept nice in this house. If you are nice, everything can be yours, too"". The phone now says ""Mommy. My mommy."" Sonia says she was confused by this, but she says ""Yes, I can be your mommy, too, if you'd like."" Then nothing else happened.

Well I'm good and properly freaked out, now. 

SO that night I go to bed. I hear stuff, I know something's there. I turn on the light, put on my headphones, and go to sleep. 

I have an incredibly vivid dream that night **Keep in mind this is a dream, because there is alot of detail, and it seems real**, that me and Sonia's daughter of my age, Holly, are upstairs in that room. We laying stomach down next to eachother on the bed looking at something on her iphone when suddenly we hear ""Don't scream"". We look at eachother and start to freak a little. I said ""What?"" Holly says ""I didn't say anything"". We hear it again ""Just don't scream, okay?"" Suddenly POOF there is a very solid looking young woman standing in front of us. We both are about to scream, mouths open and she puts out her hands with a pleading look on her face and says ""NO NO! don't scream, please!!!"" And we lay there like deer in the headlights, and stare for a minute. WE're all frozen like this for a few seconds. Then I speak ""Okay.. who are you?"" She relaxes a little, seeing that we aren't going to yell or freak out, and says ""I'm Nicole."" I looked at her odd and said ""You can't be Nicole, Nicole was 3 years old when she died"". She says ""Well, being a ghost, I can choose to appear to you however I want. I could have come to you as a cat, if I really wanted, but I didn't. I thought that a young woman of your guys' age would be less frightening."" She proceeds to sit down next to Holly on the bed, and soon enough she is laying in the same position we are. Suddenly she says ""I hope you don't mind, but I borrowed your hair clip"", and sure enough, she had my clip holding up her hair so it flaired up like a peacock tail, and left her bangs down. ""Nope, it's okay"" I said... then I just start asking her questions. ""So, you died in the children's hospital, right? Why are you here? Why didn't you stay at the hospital?"" She looks at me and says ""Well, there are two reasons. When I died, I learned quickly that only sad souls stay there. And I didn't feel sad, so I didn't want to stay with them. The only thing I wanted was to see my mommy again. So I came here so I could be with her here. But then she left, and I don't know where she went. But I know that if I stay here, she'll come back for me"". I said ""How do you know she is coming back? My family lives here now, what if she doesn't?"" She said ""When she is like me, she'll come back for me."" I sat there for a minute and looked at her. I can still remember how vivid she seemed, how real, and how real the whole dream was. Holly looked like Holly. As if she were right there... I know in most of my dreams there is always something 'dream like' about people. But this was like watching a movie. Everything was so crisp and perfect. She had a very soft face. She had very pail skin, and dark brown eyes, like cow eyes. Long eyelashes, and very small, thin eyebrows. Her bangs went down to her eyes. she had a very slender, long nose, with very slender lips and not much of a chin. She began to speak again ""Listen, you guys can't tell anyone I'm here"" Holly looked at her and said ""Well, everyone already knows you're here"" I said ""yeah, you aren't exactly the quietest ghost"". She says ""No, I know they 'think' I'm here, but I've never shown myself to anyone before. And if you go and tell them, they might get scared and call a medium in, and chase me out."" I said ""out of curiosity, what happens then?"" She looks very sad, ""If we get chased out, we no longer get a 'judgement'. There is no longer a choice of a heaven, or a hell, and no decision to be made as to where we go. If we make a choice to stay somewhere after death, we have to stay. If I get forcefully thrown out by a medium, I will spend the rest of eternity in purgatory, and I'll never see mom again."" I would have asked her more questions, but at that point Sonia suddenly walked through the door to the room, and Nicole disappears. Sonia says ""are you guys doing okay? I haven't heard much coming from in here"" We look at each other and say in unison ""yeeeeahhhh...."" And that's when my alarm wakes me up. The dream is over. 

From that moment on, I was no longer scared. She liked me, that's why it always felt like she followed me. I ended up telling Sonia about the dream. She says ""I'm sure it was a visit.

After doing all the touristy things, we wound up wandering around the side streets. The cemetery is beautiful; similar in style to New-Orleans-style above ground crypts because the coral is too hard to dig into. We spent the better part of an hour walking the paths, until a six-foot iguana came crawling out of a shattered crypt. That was enough creepy for one day, and we noped back onto the streets. 

A block up and over is 808 Southard St. Most of the lots in Key West are small and heavily wooded; 808 is a large lot that is completely denuded of any trees except at its very periphery. It's a yellow-brick building, and very clearly something institutional, although there is no signage indicating what it might have been.  The building exerted a weird fascination over us, and we spent a good ten minutes trying to figure out what it might have been.  All the doors are chained shut, and all the windows are covered in chain link. Posted all around are ""No Trespassing"" signs, which ordinarily wouldn't have been enough to keep me from at least going up to peek into the windows. But as soon as my foot crossed over the boundary of the lot, my heart shot a lemur, and I pulled back. There was something that just felt not-right about the place. We conducted a strategic withdrawal (read: tried very hard not to run away screaming) and thought nothing more of it.

Two nights hence, on our last night before we flew back to real life, we decided to take a ghost tour. Our tour guide, John, was wonderfully spooky, built a great atmosphere, and was a veritable font of knowledge. It's just that none of the sites were all that scary.  He concluded the night with the story of Robert the Doll, reluctantly sharing the details of something that very clearly disturbed him. As the tour broke up, he offered to take us to one of his favorite watering holes.  We would buy him alcohol, and he would regale us with stories that weren't necessarily up to snuff for the tour, but that would still pass the time.

Most of the tour went off to Duval St for liquid refreshment, but my wife and I, along with a very nice couple from Virginia accompanied him to the bar. The husband tied John up for most of the next two hours, while my wife and I talked to the wife. John joined us for the last half-hour, and then the other couple headed off for marital bliss and a wicked hangover the next morning. We'd struck up a quick friendship with John, and he invited us to join him at his favorite bar, where he would show us what the locals drank (it wasn't something fruity and rum-based. It was Jack and cokes for... Let's just say John and I drank for another two hours, never saw the bottom of a cup, and the tab was less than twenty bucks.) The conversation wandered hither and yon, and was just fantastic. More in my cups than usual, I finally remembered the yellow building.

The following, while not verbatim, gets the point across-
Me: So, I've got a spooky question.
John: Go ahead.
M: We headed away from the cemetery, and there's this weird building...
J: yellow, old, square?
M: That's the one!
J: Not going to talk about it. Move on.
M: O...k?

So does anyone have any idea what it was, and why it feels so weird?",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_12jrcv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/12jrcv/curious_about_a_creepy_building_in_key_west/,
1346323027.0,46,self.Paranormal,z2kqm,So I just found out that this subreddit existed so I thought that I would share my story,BlondeJesus,54,8,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/z2kqm/so_i_just_found_out_that_this_subreddit_existed/,"So when i was pretty young my parents purchased a rental house on a small island next to Saint Augustine, Florida.  On the first night that we stayed there I remember waking up in the middle of the night.  Outside the wind was howling.  However, it also sounded like people moaning and on top of that I could hear the sound of chains rattling.  After a minute or two my bead started shaking and then my brother, who was sleeping in a different bed in the same room, asked me in a very frightened sounding voice if my bed was shaking and if I could hear all the scary noises outside of our room.  The next morning we were both convinced that the house was haunted and we told our parents but they just said that it was just the wind.

Nothing really happened at the house until a couple of years later.  Some friends of me and my brother were visiting the house with my family.  Towards the beginning of the trip they told us to go outside and check out this thing they found behind the house.  Sitting in the sand there was a huge old rusty chain, the kind that would have been used hundreds of years ago.  Upon seeing it my brother and me just froze.  We both had a feeling that the chain had to do with what happened on our first night staying at the house.  A few hours after the chain was found it simply vanished.  There is nothing way to explain how the chain could have either gotten to where it was or how it left.  The house is about 200 feet from the beach and between the beach and my house is vegetation.  Also, both my neighbors rented out there houses too but there was no one staying at either of the houses.

After this my family decided to do a bit of research to see if there was anything that could have happened where the house is.  We found out that one time when Saint Augustine was still under Spanish control the French tried to attack the city.  However, there was a tropical storm when they planned the invasion and all of the ships got disorganized.  The ships then came ashore one-by-one on the island that my house is one and each time they did the Spanish chained up the French, marched them across the beach, and then shot them.  The island that my house is on is technically a sand spit (currents push sand onto the shores so it slowly grows over time) which means that my house would have been directly on the beach during the time the French prisoners were shot.

After finding this out one of my Uncles was staying at the house.  After his first night staying at the house he was talking to me mom and told her that while he was laying in his bed he heard the sound of gunshots outside the house.  However, it sounded like musket fire rather than modern day firearms (he has been a member of the NRA for over 20 years).  We have sense then started asking friends and family if they ever heard anything during the night after there first night staying there and they almost always say that they heard what sounds like the rustling of chains and the crackling of gunfire.  However, it's only on there first night that people here something.

So if you like them, take a gander at this story.

This happened to me in 2010 at my parent's house in South Dakota, around the end of november; so it's been almost 2 years since I have had an encounter sadly.

I was heading to bed, just after watching Disney's Lady and The Tramp, enjoying the nostalgia and what I thought of the movie now that I was an adult and could actually think out an opinion of a movie. 

It was around 12 am, I came down the stairs into the basement where my old room was. Closing my bedroom door, I had gotten down to my shirt and boxers, reaching and pulling the string switch for the light and crawled into bed. Only a few parts of my room were lit up from the modem, glowing orange, and my alarm clock, glowing blue. 

I heard the heater kick on and soon felt the warm air filling my room, so I flipped the covers, exposing my legs and feet to the relatively cooler air. My mom always kept the heater on during the winter, even if it wasn't that cold outside.

As I was getting comfy, eyes growing heavy, I remember feeling a much colder part of air ""settle"" on my left foot. I welcomed the cooler air, for I was rather warm thanks to the heater. But the cooler air moved up one of my legs. I didn't think anything of it and soon fell asleep.

I woke up not much later, looking at the alarm clock. 1:40 AM. I rolled over in my bed, facing away from the alarm clock twoards my modem.
And there she was.

She had a very young looking face for a apparition, she looked around the age of 28. She actually had a quite beautiful face, and to compliment it she had long straight hair going down past her shoulders. Although she dissapeared after her shoulders, the rest of her body was a cloudy like mist. She was entirely gray in color. And then I noticed something. She was smiling. 

Her and I stared at each other for what felt like hours, before I finally decided to say something when I realized I didn't find her threatening at all. ""What's your name?"" 

She didn't respond, but instead started to move twoards me. I, like a fool, got out of my bed and grabbed the string switch to the light and clicked it on. She was gone. My heart was pounding. Was I scared? I tried turning off the light again to see if she would re-appear. She didn't. I turned the light back on, and went back to bed.

I awoke the next morning, feeling groggy as usual, so I went to take a shower. A hot one at that to really wake me up. Once I stepped out, I noticed on my mirror it had fogged up. But that wasn't the odd thing. On it, wiped away from the fog with lady like fingers, was a name. 

It spelled ""Leah.""",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1337270813.0,,,True,t3_trrpw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/trrpw/she_has_such_a_pretty_name_i_wish_she_would_visit/,

I will continue to use mirrors, but I have seen some strange stuff that has convinced me that it is not just simply a reflection that I see. 

In the bedroom of the house that I grew up had a full length mirror on the closet door. At night I would occasionally see movement in the reflection, subtle and faint, almost as it was a shadow. This happened for many years and nothing else. That is, until one day when I was getting ready for school when I was nine years old. 

I was just putting on my shirt, when, out of the corner of my eye, I saw my reflection do something that I clearly did not.  It wasn't threatening and I, unfortunately, do not remember what it did. It was so sudden and startling that I was stunned for several minutes. 
Since then, everytime I am at a mirror, I study it for a few. I would say that roughly 99.9% of the time, nothing would be out of the ordinary. However, those times when things are not ordinary truly send chills down my spine. Things such as: objects that are in the reflection but not on my side, the order of objects in the reflection don't match up with the order of objects on my side, sizes of objects don't match up; all sorts of small things that would be missed unless you were actively looking for them. However, the instant I took my eyes away from what I was looking at and back, the reflection would then ""match"". 

If this only happened in one location, I would tend to believe a haunting or something like that. But, it has happened in several different locations with different mirrors. 

I have not yet seen anything ""big"" happen, save for that one time in my bedroom out of the corner of eye. Everytime I study the reflection, I do so with apprehension. What will I see?

The important context is that my Aunt, whom I was incredibly close, committed suicide in late December. I was home from college to attend the funeral and help out with family affairs; by ""home"" I mean my father's home (divorced) in which I didn't have a room, so I slept on the couch. 



The experience was a dream, and although incredibly disturbing, shakes me more when put into context that it only occurred after my Aunt's personal belongings were stored in the house.



I was on the couch, layered in blankets and watching the opposite facing television on low volume as to not disturb. The living room opens to the kitchen, with the couch's back being the divider. 



The back is tall, you have to be sitting up all the way to see into the other room.



The sudden urgency to look around struck me, like that feeling you get when turning off the downstairs lights for bed and racing up the stairwell, lest ""they"" get you. Naturally, I sit up and do a quick head turn, satisfying my anxiety but expecting to not see anything.



But it was standing across the kitchen.



Small in stature, think child height, and completely nude. I say that like it had genitals, but it was smooth like those fish people from the Legend of Zelda (but more gray), so it shouldn't be described as ""nude""; but everytime I recount this I say ""nude"" because I felt...perverted looking at it. Like it was naked.



Hard to describe, but I feel an important trait.



Large eyes but exaggerated almond shape and slanted. Think, if you bunched the skin at the top of the skull and yanked back, stretching it really tight over the skull. This caused the nose to be almost flat. Its mouth was open but just dark, and it stood with its arms hanging at the sides, but they hung low, at least to the knees.



It stared right at me and I was frozen with fear for only a moment before I screamed and jumped off the couch to flee; which is where I bolt awake and sit up quickly to make sure the thing isn't standing across the kitchen looking at me.



It's not there and I sleep the rest of the night with the lights on.



The next morning, my step mother strikes up conversation with me concerning my sleeping condition because of all the lights. I tell her I had a nightmare. She nods, we were all pretty strained, and admits to having bad dreams as well. We don't disclose the dreams.



Next evening, I have the exact same dream. Incredibly vivid, like, I never remember falling asleep, it's as if I'm just watching TV and starting to doze when I glance around during an infomercial to see it staring at me. And then I wake up in terror. But every detail is exact, which is abnormal for my usual dreams of being lost or trying to get to the mall to get a pony for my brother.



Lights go on and the next morning my step mother again asks if I'm alright. I explain The dream and how peculiar it is to me to, not only have such a vivid nightmare, but that the exact same thing had happened two nights in a row. 



During my explanation I see her face get concerned, at the time I thought she was concerned for my feelings, but when Im done talking she is just quiet - not the usual: ""that's so weird. I'm sorry, hun.""



She glances over to the spot where I saw the thing in my dream and says: ""I dream about it too,"" in complete cliche fashion. 



I'm shocked. I've always been a believer in the paranormal, but not outloud in this side of the family. I press for details because my account of the dream labeled the thing as ""this frightening fish boy"". 



She describes her dream as her getting up to check on my siblings across the walkway that looks into our kitchen. As she glances down to check on me she sees it standing into kitchen, but staring straight up at her. She screams and wakes up in ""fall out of bed"" fashion. 



I don't know why I still think this way, and I'll never be able to rationalize it, but I know it had to do with my Aunt's belongings. I immediately say:



""It's here because of Debbie.""



My step mom isn't dumb, but she's not the quickest thinker in piecing together information. Normally, if I had jumped to a conclusion without wording myself like a fourth grader (like when you have to write the question in your answer) she would have responded with: ""huh""



Instead, she tells me: ""I know.""



That day we burned sage around my Aunt's belongings. My grandmother had used it ""to cleanse"" the location of the suicide and had left it to us. Never had the dream again, not did my step mother.



This may just come off as dumb or weird and not paranormal. I don't know how to logically conclude my jump from that thing in the kitchen to my Aunt's belongings being in the house, but I just knew.



I guess I feel there was negative energy surrounding them as all were incredibly personal to her during those dark months. But the vivid dream and the real terror were so intense, I had never experienced anything like that in my dreams.



Out of all my experiences, even the physical ones, this always frightens me the most.

I honestly don't know why I even posted on this paranormal subreddit.

Some people on this subreddit are genuinely interested in the paranormal but most people here aren't.

I post on here because I had this understanding that people liked most things paranormal and/or things that can't be explained. I don't get how you can say ""WASNT IN A LAB SETTING NOT TRUE"" as if anything paranormal has ever been in a lab setting.

The whole logical fallacy of ""well if it can be faked then there's no way it's real"" is beyond comprehension. Sure most things can be faked but it doesn't mean that they were faked. I don't understand the people who even go on this subreddit if all you do is go from post to post screaming ""FAAAAKKEEEE, ANYONE CAN DO THIS HURRRRRR"" whilst playing the skin flute to every single post by skeptoid.

I bet most people here think that the moon landing was faked too...right? Fuck.

When I was about 5 my family moved into a house in Pennsylvania. Nobody had ever lived in the house before us, seeing as how we had it built. Shortly after moving in, I would see a black figure and even asked my mom if she saw the man standing in front of the house. For a while I was the only one who dealt with any sort of phenomena. Even as a child I was plagued with nightmares; mostly of figures waiting in the basement for me to venture down there. Eventually, my mother began to witness the odd things going on in that house. Pictures of my deceased grandfather would be face down, and my mother would fix them, only to find them face down again. We would hear footsteps in the attic, and I would hear a male's voice from time to time. In that house I never felt safe, or even alone. The feeling of being watched went with me anywhere I went. During the day, the only thing odd about that house was the creepy feeling, but at night things changed. A family friend heard a man shush her, someone was banging on the front door in the middle of the night, sounds of glass shattering could be heard, and the voice could be heard. About 8 years later, we moved out of the house and went to North Carolina. We lived there for 6 months and nothing ever happened. After living in a house where I always looked over my shoulder, being in a place with no activity was nice. Then we had to move back to Pennsylvania. 

The new house was nice and everything was fine for months. Eventually we went by the old house that was only about 40 minutes away. After that trip I had an odd nightmare where I asked my mom if whatever was in that house could follow us home, and in the dream whatever it was got in the car with us and went to the new home. Shortly after that nightmare, more ensued. Every night I was struck with nightmare after nightmare of the same thing harassing me. It got to the point where I no longer wanted to sleep. After one particular nightmare, I thought I went completely insane. 

In the dream the thing that had been haunting me preyed on my biggest fear, which is being kidnapped. The day after, I was out shoveling snow in the dark and heard a car coming down the street, which was odd since there was probably at least 6 inches of snow on the ground at the time. Before I even caught a glimpse of the car, for some reason I knew it was familiar and I was consumed by dread. As the car went past, I confirmed that it was the same exact car from the dream. It went past me, slammed on the back, and back up. I couldn't look in the car because I knew it was whatever was 'haunting' me. After asking me a question, they drove up to the neighbor's house, grabbed a pizza box from the back seat, walked up, rang the doorbell, and instantly turned away. The guy threw the pizza box in the back, literally, and sped off. The worst part was the neighbors weren't even home. . .how could they order a pizza? After running into the garage, I threw the shovel in and ran in the house, hitting the button to close the garage. There was a loud bang from the garage, and the door went back up. I went to see what happened and the shovel, which I left in the middle of the garage, was now laying in the middle of the driveway. 

After that night, everything seemed to pick up in the house. The nightmares continued, and I began to feel the toll it was taking on me. During the day, again, everything was relatively normal, but at night the activity picked up. Pieces of my nightmares would come true the next day, which freaked me out to say the least. At one point when I was in the shower, I heard someone knock on the door, then I heard the door open, even though I always lock it, and someone walked in. I knew if I moved the curtain someone would be standing there, but nobody answered when I called out. Eventually the feeling of the presence faded, and when I left the bathroom I found out I was alone on the second floor of the house. The activity got worse and worse until I felt as though I couldn't take it anymore. I finally told my mom, and of course, she said I was just imagining things. Later on, when my parents left, I heard a door downstairs open, and I instantly thought someone was inside. I grabbed a knife and headed downstairs, probably not a good idea, and there was nobody there. I went back upstairs, keeping the knife by me just in case there was an intruder, and I could hear someone on the stairs behind me. Freaking out, I went to the opposite wall and waited for someone to walk up. Of course, nobody was there. This would happen almost every time I was alone, and once I even found the back door wide open, while it was still locked. Then one night, I was alone, and it felt like someone was behind me, watching me. I figured it was just like every other time, but for some reason I felt almost threatened. After about 5 minutes of sitting there, scared out of my wits, I finally got the courage to go down the hall to my room. Once there, I heard footsteps coming down the hall and the doorknobs rattling. I knew it was going to make it to my room within seconds, but for some reason it never did. A little while later, we packed up and moved again. I never thought I'd be so happy to leave everything behind. 

Now, in my current house, for about 6 months, everything was normal. I was happy like I used to be, but again, the activity occurred again. Any sort of happiness I had seemed to just vanish. I became the angry person I used to be as soon as the activity began again. Everyone noticed the change but chose not to say anything. At this point I almost knew I was going crazy. I would hear the door slam and footsteps down the hall like usual. This time I was awoken at about 3 in the morning to a clicking noise. I couldn't figure out what it was until I looked at the door and saw the knob turning slightly. Now thoroughly freaked out, I couldn't get back to sleep. At night, I'll hear odd things, and the nightmares have come back. I'll hear voices calling my name and saying things I can't understand. Once I heard a scratching at my door, thinking it was the dog wanting in, I opened the door, and the hall was pitch black, and the dog was in his bed. After telling my mom everything, she tried to find help and found a woman who said she could. She told us it was something attached to a piece of furniture in my bedroom and to take it out. We then moved the 'haunted' vanity into the garage, and the next day the door to the garage kept swinging open. We tried to debunk it over and over again, but we just couldn't. The door opened against the wind and refused to close no matter how hard the wind blew against it. A few days later, there was a storm with high winds and no matter which way the wind blew, the door to the garage just wouldn't open. Activity in the house still continues though, even with the vanity outside. 

Not only do I deal with the activity in the houses, but every now and then I'll see a spirit or something along the lines of that. Once a woman in a long dress walked across the street and vanished in front of my eyes, and another instance there was a black figure at night which ran from next to a tree. 

I have absolutely no clue what to do. . .Am I just going crazy? Or is there something really there that wants my attention? Help would really be appreciated if there's any to be given.

1323174108.0,45,self.Paranormal,n2fl8,I am a Ouija board virgin and I intend to keep it that way. This is why...,foshiznick,59,14,115,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/n2fl8/i_am_a_ouija_board_virgin_and_i_intend_to_keep_it/,"I was warned off the Ouija board from when I was little. My mother made me promise her I'd never use one and I would never go back on my word. The back story to why is this.

My Mum had a baby brother called David who died at a very young age. Understandably, it was very upsetting for my family. She was about 12 at the time with two sisters and another brother. My Nan had decided to use a Ouija board to contact David. The first couple of times they used it, the spirit they were contacting was supposedly David which my family believed whole heartedly. But a few more times went by and the things that were being said became weird and then eventually scary. My mum never really went into too much detail as I was quite young, but basically whoever they were contacting masked themselves as someone they loved and missed terribly to trick them. Now this is quite upsetting to think about my Nan in such a horrible situation and I will never use a Ouija board and I will make sure my kids don’t. 

Their house was obviously haunted. As they grew up in the house (they would hear doors opening and closing, feel tugging on their bed sheets and footsteps on the stairs when no one else was home etc) and around the time they used the Ouija board it got a lot worse. But as the kids grew up, the house went quiet for years. That’s when me my brother and cousin arrived in the world, the house came alive with paranormal activity again. Now, I can’t remember everything as I was very young but my Nan would ask why we would get up so early when we stay over (about 4 or 5 am) and we would say the little boy behind the curtain wanted us to play!

So what are your views on this Ouija board experience? My Granddad nick named their ghost ‘Molly’. It was never evil as such, but was damn scary. Do you think Molly could have been the spirit they spoke to as she/he was very close to them and maybe knew about David? Has anyone else had or know of spirits tricking people in such a way? 

Also, just a note to say a lot of the houses on the estate were haunted. The whole estate is currently being pulled down to make way for new homes. But it is situated in Liverpool, England, near the docks which was heavily bombed in the 2nd world war and was built on top of the old houses that had been reduced to rubble in which a many died.

1370058218.0,42,self.Paranormal,1fg3t2,MY experience with Ouija,Lillibeth,65,23,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1fg3t2/my_experience_with_ouija/,"Seeing a few Ouija posts and seeing everyone saying they are ""horrible trouble"" really makes me want to share my story, and my very interesting experiences.

This is a little long, sorry. Details will probably be a bit shaky, it has been about a year since this happened.

I was doing Ouija with my friend, both of our first times, but I did research to make sure we were doing it safely and properly. First few times we didn't think we got anything. Numbers didn't make sense. We would ask what year they died and it was always a huge number that didn't make sense. We were confused and kept going.

Again, it didn't seem like we were getting anything until we noticed a pattern. Every spirit that we came in contact with was under the age of ten, and kept giving us the same number for the year of death. They all pointed to the sun when we asked where they were now and they all said they died in New Zealand.

My friend and I were confused so we looked up the number they kept giving us for the year, and it was the zip code for an area in New Zealand. My friend and I flipped shit. I mean, there is just no way we would commonly know that and that our mind would sub consciously pick those numbers. It was very very freaky.

We focused our thoughts on getting some of those children again, and we did. Asked them how they died, they spelled ""Killed"". We asked if they were all murdered, they said yes. They even gave us a name (a name by which I can't remember sadly. Wish I could.). They told us she had died in a fire a few years ago.

So then we focused on contacting her, and we did. We asked how old she was, it pointed to zero (a sign of contacting a demon. But we really really wanted to talk to her. The key to talking to a ""demon"" is to stay very calm and very respectful). We asked where she was, it pointed to the moon. We started asking about the murders, asked if she regretted it, she said no, asked how many she killed, it was a huge number although I can't remember it, we asked if she had help and she said ""husband"", asked if she did more than just kill the kids, she spelled ""rape"". Asked if she ever got caught, she said no.

We ended that session properly, said thank you for the time and information and moved it to Good Bye. We tried looking up more information of this supposedly ""mass murder"" but couldn't really get much from it.

The only thing bad that happened from that was that for about a week after I couldn't even walk into my room. As soon as you walked into my room is was such a heavy feeling, and such sadness. So my friend and I whipped out the board again, and focused on whatever was in the room. Turns out we didn't close a session properly with a little boy we contacted, I asked him if he wanted out and he said yes, I asked him if he was angry and he said no. So I went out and bought some saige, did a cleansing, contacted him again and he said he was out and we closed it properly and then everything was fine! 


Now a REALLY cool story that still makes me smile to this day.
It was the second time my friend and I did Ouija, we contacted a 17 year old boy that died in a fire in Dallas. Died in 2010 I think. I was 17 at the time so it was cool that we contacted someone that was around our age. He was cool, he liked the same bands as me and stuff. Spelled out the word ""beautiful"" and I asked if he was talking about me or my friend and he spelled out ""Lillibeth"". He was really funny, if we said a joke he would even spell out ""lol"" or he would say ""jk"". He talked like a teenager. Eventually my curtains we were sitting by started moving. I asked if that was him. He said ""Yes"" and said he was in the room. I know it wasnt a spirit toying, it was such a comforting feeling and it was full of happiness. We sat for a while, just feeling him around us. My friend starred at me and said ""Your hair just moved against your face liek someone was petting you."" I didn't feel it, but I was smiling so big and asked if he did that, he said yes. I asked him to do it again. All of the sudden I felt like I was being embraced, and at that time he speleld out ""hug"" . My God it was great.

Before we ended the session we asked him if he had any more questions for us; he spelled ""lillibeth... single"" I laughed and told him that sadly, no I had a boyfriend and he spelled ""sad"" and then the we ended the session.

For the next two weeks I felt so comfortable in my house. I was sleeping incredibly well and I could just feel goodness in the home. I contacted him again, and said he was there for 2 weeks. I asked him if I trapped him and he said no and spelled ""Chose"" but said he was ready to be back with his family. So I ended properly, and didn't feel him anymore. 

I tried several times after that to contact him again, but every time I did he was very angry that I did, and I could feel the anger. So I let him be and haven't contacted him in about a year.

So yeah, those are some of my experiences, and I say that if you do everything properly, Ouija isn't all much of a bad thing. Too much of it can be, but it is quite interesting if done correctly.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1fg3t2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1fg3t2/my_experience_with_ouija/,

Pretty sure there is some rational explanation for this encounter but would be interested in any opinions, similar encounters and theories. It's going to be long so to be a bit backward I'll kick off with the **tl;dr** - it's a variant on what I've recently discovered is called the black eyed kids phenomena.

Bit of scene setting. In 96/97 I lived in a fairly old terraced house with a cemetary at the end of the road - cliche I know but it's an important detail - nothing remarkable about the house or the area it was just convenient for college.

Anyway I was up late one night on the PC in my bedroom which looked out onto the street. Was about 2 or 3 am. For whatever reason, probably to give my eyes a rest, I wandered over to the window and looked down the road in the direction of the cemetary (although it was too far down the street for me to see) and I saw 3 people walking slowly down the road.

I could see that they were quite old and appeared to be dressed in funeral clothes which given the hour was weird. There were 2 women and a man, I'd put their ages at about 80 and the woman in the middle was being steadied/guided by the other woman and the man and as they came closer I got the impression that she was upset. My first thought was that given their age she had recently buried her husband and grief had caused her to behave slightly irrationally causing her to try to be out near the cemetary at that hour and that the other 2 were friends/relatives trying to look after her and get her home. Anyway it was all interesting enough for me to carry on watching as they got closer to the house.

Just outside the front of the house was a street lamp, I watched them as they made their way past but when they got to the lamp-post they all stopped and the upset woman in the middle looked up at me and grinned.

This was when things got weird - the grin became a sort of grimace and if there was any colour in her face to start with it was now dead white. At that point I realised I was staring right into her eyes, but her eyes were pitch black. Time sort of dilated. If you've ever crashed a car the final split second before you make impact seems to drag out as you process more information than normal in the timeframe, it was that sort of thing. I'm sure we only made eye contact for a second but it felt like several minutes as my peripheral vision faded and I felt like all I could see was these 2 black holes in her face drawing me in - although the distance between us didn't change she somehow felt like she was coming closer and I was kind of aware although I couldn't honestly say I could see them at that point that the 2 people with her were just continuing to look down the road as if frozen but waiting for this woman to finish whatever she was doing.

I was suddenly hit with this intense feeling of dread and panic so I threw myself on the floor. As soon as I'd broken her gaze I felt pretty stupid that this upset old woman who clearly needed help had spooked me so badly so I looked out the window again and there was no sign of them. It was a longish straight road and the house was towards the middle so Linford Christie would have had trouble getting out of sight in the time I looked away let alone 3 octagenarians.

So reddit - any ideas what this was all about? Tired mind playing tricks? It felt far too real for that and all these years later I can still remember every detail incredibly clearly and I can recall a good amount of the dread I felt staring into those eyes - I get chills just retelling the story.

last night...and it was VERY weird",slackerish,48,8,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/ixp5d/had_my_first_weird_experience_with_an_ouija_board/,"So, I'll be as brief as I can. I believe in the paranormal but Ouija Boards have always been something I've been on the fence about. I know that a lot of what I'm about to say is going to emit a lot of ""you shouldn't have fucking done that, dumbass"" responses and I accept that I handled the situation poorly. So that said, here we go:

Last night me and two friends were using his Ouija Board when we contacted a particularly fucked up ""spirit."" Two of us were high and we were all drunk and yes I realize this is where the first problem enlies. Long story short, he told us he was a demon, he gave us a name we didn't remember or coudln't quite spell (something like Sadijka followed by a series of random letters if I remember correctly). He said he wanted something from us, but wouldn't say what. He said he intended to hurt all of us. We asked him why he hated us,  he said ""Lust."" We asked what we lusted for, he said ""Me."" He did a Figure 8 (I later read this is not something you want a spirit to do), landed on the 6, and started saying other random things but REALLY didn't want us to leave. We finally left, and in our stupidity, contacted it a couple more times. Each time he said 'goodbye' before we were done talking to it. 

so here's where it gets really weird: First off, within about five minutes all of our cell phones act without us touching them. One of my friends gets a ring informing him he has a text, no text. One of them says he has a missed call, then looks to see that he has no missed call. I look at the couch and my phone has dialed the number 0 and is calling it. Shortly after, the stereo turns on without any of us even remotely near it. We decide to go to our friends house.

So here's what it gets REALLY weird. We get back at around 3 am. My friend had lost his keys and lives in a decent part of town so he didn't lock his door, we get back and its locked (at this point his roommate was there and was able to let us in with her keys). we go inside and all of the furniture has been completely rearranged. In the kitchen, every single cabinent has been openened. Initially it looks like a break-in, but we had multiple laptops, a PS3, and a TV, none of which was taken. Nothing was removed, just moved. 

At this point ""it"" hasn't done anything else. We all made it through the night without anything weird happening. So, I ask the experts on r/paranormal: what the fuck is going on?

My daughter found a used ouija board and asked if we could buy it. I said sure why not; I've played with a ouija board when I was a teen. 
So we took the game home, my husband asked me if we found anything interesting, I told him ""nope"" I was not about to tell him about what we bought, because he is dead against anything like that. 
We went to my daughter's room and started to play. Nothing happened, no movement just nothing. We ended the game and put it away in the closet. 
That night when we were getting ready for bed my daughter asked if I could sleep with her I laughed and said, ""hell no"". She looked worried and frighten so I poked fun at her and told her ""see you wanted to play that game, serves you right."" 
Laying down next to my husband, I started to feel uneasy too, that feeling of being watched. I gave in and went to sleep with my daughter in her bed; she was covered from head to toe with her blanket. She told me she felt like a lot of people were hovering over her. I kept my cool because I felt the same way. I didn't want to scare her more. Then my husband woke up screaming at me telling me to come back to bed because I belong to him in this weird dead stare telling I belonged to him. I told him, no thanks I'll stay here with my daughter. Just like that he went back to bed no more screaming just silence. Now, I started freaking out I started quietly praying. I am not a religious person, but I guess when you are scared enough God starts looking pretty awesome. The  the uneasy feeling subsided and we were able to sleep for that night. The following night it was the same thing same screaming from my husband ""YOU BELONG TO ME"" and the uneasy feeling of being watched. My daughter and I started to pray together. That's when I decided to throw the game out. While walking to the dumpster a neighbor of ours saw what we were throwing out and asked for it. I gave it to him and told him to be careful with it. He laughed at me told me it was just a game.

I'm being attacked by shadow people.,KeyboardNinjaWarrior,76,34,89,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1f29dk/help_me_im_being_attacked_by_shadow_people/,"Ever since I was a kid, I've had a hightened perception of the supernatural. It's always been very peaceful though. I waved to a shadow person once and it waved back. Stuff like that.

This is the first time I've actually been scared. I moved into this new house and I'm stuck with a year long contract. Since the beginning, I've had nightmares here.

I haven't had nightmares since I was a kid.

A month in, around early March, I wake up around 6 am completely paralyzed. I knew I was awake, I had my right eye open and I could see the rest of my room, including my sweatshirt hanging on the bedframe. 

Directly above me was this dark figure with his hand on my chest. I felt like I was losing energy.

I kept thinking, ""Not today, not today."" I don't know why Game of Thrones was my first thought but somehow it worked. I managed to regain control over my body. I checked my phone for the time and then I see my door completely wide open.

I lock it every night.

Until today, I've had several instances of my door opening and closing by itself and one instance where a dark hand grabbed my wrist as I was watching a tv show in my room.

I've handled all of that, doing my best to not be scared. But today was different.

At 5:30 am, I was shaken awake. My entire body was paralyzed except for my right eye and my right hand. I felt pressure on my shoulder and I was being shaken back and forth from that area.

I opened my eye half way (I couldn't open it any further), and I saw inches away from me, a dark figure in almost daylight. No hat, but very humanoid. His hands were on my right shoulder and right pec and he kept shaking me.

Then he spoke. It was a male voice. I didn't know they could speak. He said, ""Come on! Come on!""

I tried to get up but the only part of my body I could move was my right hand which I curled into a fist.

I tried to voice a slurred ""Stop."" I think he got the point because when the shaking stopped, I was able to move the rest of my body.

I honestly don't know what he wanted from me, but it's been almost three months and I feel like I'm losing my mind.

Any advice?

Edit: Thank you guys for all the input. I just wanted to say that not all of the hauntings occurred with sleep paralysis. Yesterday night, I was completely awake in my room setting up my laptop. I turned around and I saw just a shadowy foot disappear. Then I moved to another room. It appears that the hauntings only occur in that one specific room. I'm not sure why.

I have considered the possibility that I am imagining things, however, these events are occurring far more often than me just thinking I saw something. But I'll try my best to relax and not think about these beings.

 Well I was 14 with my 2 older sisters (ones 16 and the other is 18) on a quad bike (as some people call them basically a off road 4 wheeler ) and we were going to my grandparents, Now we were not going the usual way which was through a big open feild with a big pile of rocks right in the middle, we kept our horses in it so we always kept it fenced off and closed. So we head off, i tell them I know where the fence was recently broken so we should use this way (me being a lazy kid not wanting to open anything) it's going though the same feild but entering through another feild from the right side, this is where it starts getting strange fast.. we were going though the feild, almost in our main feild when we see a figure sitting on the pile of rocks, ( let me remind you the pile of rocks is right in the middle of this feild, and this feild is not even a km long, ( I can provide google map images with a drawn diagram if anyone wants, I hope not..) so we can clearly see a strange dark human like figure, we think it's our uncle sitting with the horses but this thing is sitting strange, it's almost squatting, very low, if you ever watched the exorcist the beginning, this thing is sitting exactly like the devil, squatting.. We think what the fuck but keep going, it has to be out uncle right ? Well we were wrong.. We get close and this thing slowly gets up.. It's arms are unusually long, I'm not joking this thin had long arms, once I see these arms I know this isn't normal.. I freak out and tell them to stop, now we stop and I instanlty got on the driver spot, my sister was driving.. Now while I'm doing this, this thing starts running at us, with long weird strides, this thing was tall that's also how I knew it wasn't human, and it's swinging it's arms very weird.. It had to be because of how long they were. And let me also ad this thing is pure black, that's all we see no clothes no nothing just black, not some shadow.. it's just black.. So we get out of there as fast as we can, I yell at my sisters not to look at it and they're crying like stupid teenage girls would be.. I'm
Thinking goddammit this thing can hear us now .. So since we werent far from home we lose sight of this at the first corner and almost hit our deck trying to park close to our house.. And that's it, before that I would watch unsolved mysteiries and try solve everything I coud, now I know They're's things we don't know about out there, I'm not lying, I have no reason too.. but this thing freaked us out, a lot. We were so covered in fear that when we went home and told my family my cousin who was the same age as me started crying..  I'm native, I live on a reserve in Canada an we own a lot of land where this happened, so nobody but us travel those trails, we know it wasn't our uncle because we warned everyone. Even before, because of my culture, when I would hear stories about the spirites and bad spirites  I would never believe them.. I'm just a shit like that but now, now I see things different. I don't know how to explain but it opened my mind a lot, when we bring it up now, ( we all grew up, I'm 19 now) we all still say we saw the exact same thing, all three of us.. we know we saw it, we know it chased us and we most defiantly know it want normal. After all this it kinda brought my sisters and I closer together, after experiencing something you know shouldn't have happened but still does, it makes you guess your sanity , but when we were together we felt stronger, we knew we weren't crazy.. we shared a connection we never would with anyone else, and that's my story reddit.

**TL;DR**- working late, went to get coffee with co-worker, encountered black smoke thing lurking in the basement that sounded scary, looked scary, and it hissed at me. I dont know what it was.

_____________________________________________________

It happened June 2, 2012. I was at work,  it was about 11pm and I was doing my normal patient profiles on the 4 new patients that arrived from the ED. I had just finished up on my 4th patient and desperately needed coffee. I asked a co-worker if she wanted to go with me, and we walked though the basement to the other side of the hospital toward the cafe.

On the way, I saw my normal visitors (I've since made friends with the old janitor Vinny, Alice the housekeeper, and Randal.. I am still not quite certain what Randal did.) Anyway, As we are walking though the basement, I pass Vinny and give him a nod, and as we turn the corner toward the stairwell, I notice a slight... humming/buzzy sound? 

The best way for me to describe it is, if you ever lived in an apartment, or have a second story on your home, you know what it sounds like for someone to be vacuuming upstairs. Its muted, but you can hear the tone change as they move from different areas of the room.  

I've never encountered this sound before in the basement, and Julia (the nurse who went with me) noticed it as well. We dismissed it as equipment being used somewhere in the basement. 

When we were on our way back, we exited the stairwell and started around the corner when we heard the noise again, but it was much louder. It seemed to be coming from everywhere but no where... I know that sounds weird, but.. we couldn't pin point exactly what direction it was coming from. And that's when I noticed a dark vaporous apparition , it wasn't shaped like a human, more like an oval-ish cloud with what could be a head on top. It was at the end of the hallway, near the stairs we had just come down. It was outside the stairwell door, looking down toward us. 

I have never seen anything like it before, and it was quite frightening. I've read about demonic encounters and such but never have I come close to anything that would begin to be compared to as demonic. 

We quickly rushed down the hall, and even though I didn't tell Julia what I saw, we both just felt the urge to .. well sprint. When we badged into our unit and sat our coffee down, we just sorta looked at each other, and agreed that it just felt weird... in the hallway. Almost like being watched from a dark room, where you cant see in, but you just know something is looking out at you.

A few hours later, I had to retrieve a bladderscanner from PED's and again had to venture into the basement hall, I passed the same area, heard the same sound, but I didn't see anything. On my back though... It was standing in the hall. Blocking the whole hall, like a huge thick cloud. The junction is a like a  T, the top of the T being the hall I was going through and the intersecting bottom part goes toward another part of the basement and the stairwell opens into the intersecting hall. 

I didn't know what else to do, but firmly shout, ""MOVE! MOVE OUT OF MY WAY"", and aggressively make my way toward it. I was no less than 3 feet away, and it started to ... fade? or evaporate?  to one side of the hall, and I heard it growl and hiss at me as I passed. And once I was passed the intersection, that weird sound stopped. 

Now ive worked since then, I have walked though the basement and up and down the stairwell countless times now. And have yet to hear/see anything like that again. However I do feel, odd when I leave the stairwell sometimes. Julia said that a few  nights back her and Kevin were going for coffee and they could hear the buzzing sound very faintly on their way back, but it was nothing like the night we heard it. 

Ive asked Vinny about it, but he say's he has no idea what it could be. He's never seen it or heard it or heard anything about it for that matter, and hes been there for over 65 years. 


Im not sure what it could be, but any suggestions or thoughts on it would be helpful.

I have posted here a few times, so I guess you can say I've had some unexplainable things happen to me in my life.  Yesterday, at a family gathering, I was reminded of an odd experience that happened to my family on a vacation.  I was quite young, but my mother and father's story reminded me of the feelings and occurrences that happened and I began to recall it.

When I was very young my parents used to take my sister and me down to the very southern tip of the NJ shore.  We would stay in motels/hotels on the beach and take a week away from life and enjoy the shore.  This one year we stayed in a hotel that we have stayed at before.  I was about 4 and my sister was 6 at the time.  The room was a long rectangle.  Entryway, living room with a pull out bed, kitchen, bathroom, and then a large back bedroom with beds.  

The first day we arrived, everything was normal.  We headed to the beach and then went out to dinner.  We came back later and all headed to bed.  Being that we were both young, I slept in the bed with my dad and my sister slept in the bed with my mom.  The next morning we all woke up and, to our surprise, our front room seemed ransacked.  I remember my father going downstairs to the manager and asking what the hell happened.  The manager came up and said he was working the night shift and no one else was working.  My father mentioned he seemed quite sincere.  We have also stayed at that hotel before and had never had any issues.  My father told him that if it were to happen again that he would be calling the police and filing a complaint.  My father said the manager agreed with him and seemed just as concerned himself about the situation.

When we left for the beach that day, my dad told my mom to bring any jewelry she brought with her and did not leave any money lying around.  

When we came back from the beach - everything was fine in the room.  It was just as we had left it and the maid came while we were at the hotel pool right outside of our door.

The day went along normally, as did the night out.  Again, when we arrived back our room was perfectly fine.  Our sleeping arrangements were the same and my father put the Latch-Lock on that night.  I remember he reminded me that we were safe and he would protect us.

The next morning our front room was ransacked again.  Chairs were on the sofa, some clothes were scattered on the floor, and the light was on.  Also, the door was WIDE OPEN.  If someone had a key, they could not have entered because the Latch-Lock.

I remember our family being really confused about the situation.  The only other window was a small window in the back room and that was locked from the inside.

My dad mentioned yesterday that he was, and still is, a light sleeper and he was always confused that he never woke up to any forced entry or noise.  

My father went down and explained to the manager what was happening.  They both were baffled and the only other room they had available was too small for us.  So, that night, my parents decided to test it.  The latch locked the door, filled two suit cases with clothes and placed them in front of the door, and put the two chairs in front of the door as well.  My father was certain that is anyone was trying to get in, that he would hear it.

The next morning the chairs and luggage were neatly set aside and the door was, again, slightly open.  Nothing else was off in the room.

Again, we were baffled.  This continued the rest of the week there.  My father put a note to the manager to please call him and let him know if any other people experienced what we experienced that week.

We never got a call back.  Life went on for us. 

I still cannot, nor can my parents, explain the phenomena that occurred in the hotel that week.  Was it Paranormal?  Maybe.  Was it some creep coming in to mess with us?  If so that's even more creepy then an intelligent ghost.

Has anyone else had similar things happen?


Edit: Update. I spoke to my mom last night again about the incident.  She said that she and my father were too confused at the moment to think it was something paranormal and they did not think someone was coming in the room.  No one was being harmed and it just seemed like something confusing at the time.  
As for photography, she mentioned that it wasn't the age of digital photography yet and they wanted to capture the fun moments on the vacation with disposable one that they had.  So no, unfortunately, no pictures were taken.  Sorry, guys.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1374670489.0,,,True,t3_1iwdll,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1iwdll/hotel_haunting/,

""I've filmed three movies there in the last year, I love that place.
I'm also not a heavy believer in the paranormal, but I've had a few unexplained occurrences go down there.

While the crew was filming in another part of the hospital, I was the only one hanging out in the craft services area.

I sat down at one of the tables and was checking my phone, pretty sure I was accidentally showing a bit of buttcrack.

I then felt what I thought was a finger shove itself inbetween my butt cheeks, thinking it was someone from the set fucking around, I turned around and there was no one there. No one hiding, no one near me.

After realizing this, I quickly ran to where the rest of the crew was.""

[Here are a few photos](http://imgur.com/a/xZd4h) I took while on set.

Lastly, another odd occurrence happened to one of our special effects guys, he was filming in the area and kept going deeper and deeper into the hospital. There was a room that was deadbolted and he couldnt get through. However a window leading into that room was broken, as he put his camera through the hole it shut off.

The camera would not turn back on even though the battery was at least half full. Taking the battery out and returning it still prevented it from turning on.

The crew member made it back to everyone else, took the battery out of the camera, put it back in, and was able to turn it on again, never had a problem like that before, and never had one since.

Reports were the usual kind. Things being moved around, stuff that shouldn't be able to fall over by itself was doing so. Some reports of whispering voices. 

Anyway, the investigation itself did not turn up anything while we were there. It was a quiet and boring time. 

I was going back through the audio we recorded and both of these EVPs were recorded after we had packed up and were getting ready to go. I usually leave the recorders going until we are just about ready to leave.

So, I present to you:

**Number 1**

Client: ""Pay your bills!""

Me: &lt;laughing&gt;

Me: I can't make out what I was saying at the time

EVP: ?????

Me and the rest of the people talking.

I am quite a skeptic about all this stuff, but there are a few of these that give me pause and make me wonder. I don't want to jump to conclusions about certain things that happen that I can't come up with some canned explanation, but these voices are coming from somewhere or from something and I boggle sometimes that other people still hold on to the explanations of radio interference or stray signals or even auditory paraedolia. Granted many EVPs are just that. I've been recording these for many years now and listening to them from other people and just some of them leave you dumbfounded.

One last one, just because :): 

**Number 3**

This one was recorded in an old abandoned mental hospital. 

Me: ""Can you tell me what you did when you worked here?""

I am sure everyone will hear the same on 1 and 2. They are loud. The third one, I would be interested on what you all can make out of it.

Things escalated as one of our friends mentions that her and her roomies have been seeing the same ghost/spirit for 3 years. They've always lived in the same apartment and we always crash there since its close to the bars and campus - so you can imagine everyone was shocked to hear this.

Apparently none of them thought we would believe them, but other people had seen it too. It all started when they were sophomores and one of the girls, lets call her '1,' said a girl walked into her room while she was watching TV and quickly left without saying or doing anything. She kept this to herself. Fast forward a few months, 1 and 2 came back to the apartment with one of my room mates who proceeded to crash on the couch. Upon waking up, 2 found him on the floor and asked why. He said 'there was a girl on the couch after I got up to go to the bathroom, so I just slept on the floor.' Weird, both 1 and 2 were in their own rooms and never sleep on the couch. He described it as feminine, clothed in all black, maybe a cloak or something. Thats when 1 chimed in that she too had seen her before.

A year or so passed and 2 was sleeping one night during the school week, she woke up to a dark figure standing in her room. In a half daze she noticed the feminine features as well as the dark clothing/cloak, as it just disappeared. Into thin air. Her curtains flew up like a gust of wind blew through the room. She thought nothing of it until she remembered that it was December in Colorado... not the time to have your windows open.

More recently the figure has been seen by another friend visiting from out of town while sleeping on an air mattress. She said it was just standing in their kitchen (which is open and appart of the living room), and it was just watching her, so she thought it was one of the room mates. Finally, and most disturbing of all happened a few days ago. This visit or whatever is the reason for us writing this story.

So one of 2's friend from back home stayed in her room for the night and hung around in the morning while she was off running errands. He woke up around 10am with a 'different girl in the bed' and texted 2 about it. She asked what she was wearing, and you guessed it, she was wearing all black. He claims he didn't say or move with her next to him and she got up out of bed and casually left the bed and the room. Not one second later 2 returned home, not seeing her at all. They should have crossed paths, but nope.

Besides just a creepy story, all of us have been trying to Google if any deaths or anything have happened in their building. But I'm starting to think she may want something since she has twice been seen sleeping near guys, but just watching girls. Who knows, any insight, comments or equally spooky stories are welcome.

On 12/19/09, they went with a tour group, armed to the teeth with gear. I usually house sit for them when they're out of town, and this time was no exception. When they come back from a hunt, they usually have me go over all of their evidence; and this time too, was no exception. 



My parents didn't really care if I went over the footage to be honest. They didn't feel anything, and hated one of the tour hosts. The video, which I watched anyway, was pretty funny. The host mentioned was some batty psychic, talking about her pet possessed dolls or something like that. At one point my parents are in another room, next to the room with this lady. My mom was muttering about what a stupid hag she was, when the host apparently heard her the room over, *and started asking the spirits why they were saying such mean things about her*. 



At that point, my family decided to wander further from the bulk of the herd, and found themselves near what looked like pantries and a plain, utilitarian mess hall. I'm not sure what the rooms were, but that's what they appeared to be. 



[This clip](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Syj4nOKa-yU) is the only interesting thing on their camera or voice recorder. Specifically, watch directly behind the wall at :06 - :08. My family doesn't react, didn't even notice. To me, this looked like a small child with glowing 'eyes'. My family, after the clip here cuts out, goes into that room. Its the mess hall (or maybe a detention center? Like I said, no idea) I mentioned previously. Looks like a single table in there, and nothing else. No reflective surfaces, no animals, no windows.



Unfortunately, I'm not tech savvy enough nor have the equipment to slow it down, enhance it, whatever it is people do to authenticate or debunk sightings. I'd love to have your opinions on this video. I don't believe in ghosts in the traditional way (hard to when you don't believe in souls and the like), but trying to figure this out has kinda been an on/ off hobby of mine since seeing it. My family, as a note, think its nothing since they felt no presence that night.

Still to this day I have no clue if it was paranormal or extremely well executed and, frankly, I don't want to know. Figured this would be the best place to post it, considering I am pretty certain it was indeed paranormal and wouldn't mind some feedback or thoughts.
This happened in about late December, a week or so before New Years. I haven't posted anything about it before now because I didn't feel all to comfortable talking about it but now I'm fine with it.

It was Christmas and New Years break and I had decided to spend some time with a friend of mine, I spent the night there and one quickly turned into three. On the third night my mother had called me asking if I had come to the house earlier to collect some clothes or something and, seeing as I hadn't, I said 'no'- she called at around 1:30 am and my mother is not the type of person to call people so late, even me. She hung up quickly after that with no other explanation and I was a bit worried but she obviously wasn't injured and she can handle herself. About half an hour later my friend's sister called and wanted to talk to me. She proceeded by telling me how my mother, herself, and some of their friends had gone out that night for the span of a couple hours or so but what she had told me about what they found upon returning is the disturbing part. They got back to the house to find that all of the lights of the house where turned on, the door and (after checking everything) no other entrance had shown signs of forced entry, all of the windows where locked- even the upstairs ones. When they walked in the living room furniture was moved around a bit but not too much, the scary bit is my room. My door was wide open - this in of itself is weird, as I always keep it shut and so does my mother- and looking inside they saw that all of my clothes had been thrown from my drawers and my belongings strewn about, on the floor was a picture of me when I was in elementary school along with my birth certificate. None of the other rooms or objects, besides the living room, had been bothered.

I stayed another three days because like hell I was going back to the house after that if I could help it. On the night of the third day something happened again. Now my mothers friends had been staying at the house with her and this night they where both sleeping on different parts of the couch, her friend woke up at around 2 am and the room was freezing despite both the heat being on and the wood stove. My mother woke up shortly and they both went to check my room, the door was closed as they had left it and the inside was fine but the door frame was bent in ""like something was trying to get out"" as my friend's sister put it. A couple days later they cleansed the house.

After about one more night I had to go back, seeing as school was starting up again and getting comfortable with the house again took some time- I slept on the couch until about a week before I moved out because I didn't want to sleep in my bed. Now here I am, I thought at least someone would get a kick out of reading this and now I'm putting this up.

It was a decision I made because I desperately needed a change, and not because anything had bothered me into it. Up until that point I hadn't had any problems in my house. When I moved back to start my senior year I started feeling really weird in my room. I had dreams about an old man sitting on the end of my bed watching me as I slept, and other times as I was starting to fall asleep I would hear footsteps walking around my room, and something flipping through my books. At this time I was starting to get into ghost hunting outside of my house, and I had a good friend who was super sensitive, way more than I was come out. She said she felt them too, and said he felt it was his room and he didn't want me in it. We did a salt barrier and banished anything from the space that was there without my permission. You could feel the anger instantly. For a while after whenever I would get in the shower I would feel watched and I would come out with scratches that I couldn't explain. I started to feel weird looking in any mirror in the house to the point where I turned the mirror in my room to face the wall, it is like this to this day. Eventually it seemed to go away, and I was fine in my home again. 

This year I went away to College, and though I visited some, I rarely stayed in my room, for reasons I don't really know. I've been home for the summer for about two weeks now, and I've been sleeping on the couch because I didn't want to deal with the mess in my room that resulted from me moving all my stuff in. I've been really busy with a new job, a new boy, and seeing all of my friends again so I haven't spent that much time at home, especially in my room. Tonight though my brother slept on the other couch in the living room, and with him and the dog I just haven't been able to fall asleep so I decided to go into my room for the first night. Right as I was starting to fall asleep I heard the sound of keys jingling, and then something tug on my blanket. I decided to ignore it, and attempted to not give out any energy except to send out the notion that this was my room, and it was not welcome. I eventually started to fall asleep again, and I felt something run pressure about the size of a hand up my side from my hip to my shoulder. I really thought this was dealt with and over, I haven't felt weird anywhere else in the house since I've been home.

1368599210.0,37,self.Paranormal,1edaro,Long story of 10+ years of paranormal experiences.,PeacefullyBrewed,54,17,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1edaro/long_story_of_10_years_of_paranormal_experiences/,"Like I said this will probably end up being very long but I believe well worth the read. Some, if not all might be able to be explained but no doubt that all of this really happened and changed my life.

First some background. I'm from the Midwest and currently 23. Everything started happening to my family when I was around 7 or 8. The house we were living in at the time was built on an old Native American Burial ground or something of the such. My great-grandfather passed away peacefully in the house long before I was born and my grandparents spent 3/4 of their life living in the house before we moved in and they lived beside us. My grandparents, aunt, and mother never mentioned any paranormal experiences in the house before and had a normal life living there. I will probably break this down into 2 parts because of the length and try to keep everything in order but some things happened a while ago.

Growing up I had a younger brother by 2 years and an older sister by 5. My brother and I were much closer and spent most of the day playing and wrestling since we were closer in age. We were never the most creative or imaginative kids so when things started happening there was no doubt in our parents believing was going on. When my brother was around 5 or 6 he had a new ""friend"". He would tell our family about his new friend, how he would play and talk with him all the time and seemed genuinely excited about this. My mom started asking questions about this friend and my brother told her his name was ""Him"" and that he was a man. First my mom just blew this off as nothing until my brother started spending more time alone with this friend. I remember going into the bedroom we shared and my brother playing with the checkers board we had. I asked what he was doing and he simply replied ""Playing with Him"". I blew it off told him to stop making stuff up and left. I noticed him doing this a few other time a remember a time I watched from around the door and seen the checkers pieces move on their own. 

I told my mom immediately and she called my brother downstairs and asked what ""Him"" looked like. My brother grabbed an encyclopedia that we had and found an old 1800s looking man with a long white beard and very eerie looking and said that he looked like this. My mom a little weirded out told my brother he could no longer play with ""Him"". That night some really weird things happened that has never happened to anyone in our family. When I've talked to my mom much later after this she recalls the event like this, she went to bed that night with my dad just like any other night. After falling asleep she was awoken by feeling like she was being held down. She said she was being held by her ankles, wrists, and that someone was sitting on her chest choking her. She said she couldn't make a noise and could see my dad sleeping beside her but couldn't wake him up.

In the months following my brother stopped playing with ""Him"" and my mom had this happen to her a few more times. The last time she said something spoke to her in a mans voice. It told her that this was because she wouldn't let my brother play with him. After that other unexplained things would happen around the house. Watches and batteries came up missing in the middle of the night, the sound of music would play though one of the walls late at night and when you would get up to it, it would stop. We decided to do some remodeling and tore down the wall that the music would come from to find nothing inside and the music was never heard again. Another thing is my dad would always shut all the lights off and lock the doors after we went upstairs for bed and would get in the shower. He would always try to make a spooky ""OoooOOOOHHOOO"" sound up the stairs to just scare us. One night after shutting the lights off and such he made the noise from the bottom of the stairs and something at the top of the stairs made the noise back at him. Also my mom and dad would hear pots and pans banging around at night like they were being thrown from the cabinets and come downstairs to find nothing being moved.

My mom finally decided to have my dad's brother come over since he was a Pastor at a fairly large church and ""bless"" the house. We were kept downstairs watching tv the whole time while he went from basement to attic praying. I remember his face after being done, he looked drained of color. He told my parents he found and felt nothing and everything should be fine. We never had another problem in that house again.

Fast forward about 1 month, all of my dad's brothers and family would visit their parents house regularly and the uncle who blessed our house went there after leaving our house. Now unexplained things starting happening at her house for a few weeks. Clothes would be ripped of the line outside that were just put up to dry, medicine cabinet in the bathroom would be opened and everything would be thrown onto the floor. Then one week another uncle of mine went to my grandmothers house before church. Towards the end of the church session this woman apparently became ""possessed"". Both uncles were there and I've heard the story countless times from them and others. This lady was around 4'8"" and weighed about 120 lbs. It took 5 full grown men to hold her down while she was screaming in a ""demonic"" voice and seemed to be speaking in other languages. This went on for about 2 hours and when my uncle (the pastor) asked who this demon was he simply said his name was ""Him"". My uncle then knew everything. He said he sent to demon back to hell and the lady was then fine. We figured that ""Him"" followed my uncle that night to my grandmothers, then followed my other uncle to the church where he possessed a woman before being sent back to wherever. We never had any more experiences in that house until we moved when I was 12.

I will make a part 2 if anyone is interested. Like I said sorry this is long and you probably won't want to take the time but if you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer anything I can.

1365533500.0,38,self.Paranormal,1c092u,My experience from a few years back,waffleknight,45,7,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1c092u/my_experience_from_a_few_years_back/,"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to share my own experience with paranormal phenomenon - from around 2010.  I should say that throughout this, I was pretty skeptical, but truly confused, and at times scared, of all this.  I still don't quite know what happened during this time.  I was living in an apartment with my brother, his wife, and my nephew.  The way the place was laid out was basically one large living room/dining room/kitchen, and then a long hall with rooms and one bathroom off of it.  I had, for a while, my computer desk set up such that it was on the edge of the living room, opposite the entrance to the hall, facing down it.  My room was at the end there.

The first experience was when I was home sick from work, and sitting there on the computer.  My bedroom door was open at the end of the hall, and I happened to glance up, and saw a shadowy figure move across the door way into the room.  I only got the barest of glances, I 'caught' it just as the torso moved past the door, and the leg as it moved forward.  To say 'shadow' is perhaps a bit incorrect, I saw it as more like moving, thick, gray dust, if that makes any sense.  I was shaken for a moment, but brushed it off, chalking it up to being sick.  

It happened again, a few days later, but this time I was returning from the kitchen half of the large room, and rounding the corner of my desk, when I glanced over at my bedroom.  This time, I saw the figure appearing to be standing next to a tall plant on the back wall of my room, opposite the doorway.  Like the first time, it was a tall figure, maybe 6-foot plus, and it looked like it was made of dense gray dust.  I did a double-take, and of course, it was gone, but I was very startled and jumpy from that point on.  

I told my brother about it, and he of course got a little creeped out, but I still chalked it up to too much work, too little sleep.  

Around this time, I switched from a PC to a laptop, and set myself up in my room, in a chair adjacent to the bed, hoping to not have anymore problems, if perhaps these sightings were just a trick of the light, or my own momentary 'hallucination', etc.  

I started to have terrible insomnia immediately afterwards.  I couldn't get to sleep until 2 or 3am, despite always having been a morning person most of my life.  The next incident happened at this time - I was using the bathroom connected to my room, and sitting on the toilet.  I heard something that sounded like laughter up above me, out of the little fan unit.  We're on the top floor of the complex.  As I look up, dust starts falling down on my face, out of the fan.  Probably about a small handful of the stuff.  

Things then just started getting stranger.  I didn't like being alone in the house, and trying to get any sleep at night was pretty awful.  I actually ended up taking a little vacation from work, and becoming a night owl - I'd stay up all night, and sleep during the day.  One night, I was trying to head to sleep a little early, and woke up around 4am.  I looked over into the corner, where the tall plant is, and saw an intensely bright light.  It wasn't like light coming from a car through the window, or from something in the room, it was like a blob of light.  I don't remember it very well, I know I didn't get out of bed to check on it, I believe I fell back asleep.  

Later in the week, I was sitting in my computer chair, next to my bed, when I heard a very faint 'tap' sound.  Incredibly faint, and I have pretty good hearing.  I looked over, and saw a dead fly on the bed.  And then another fell, and then another, and then another.  All dead, all in the same spot.  

Another time, I saw another 'whoosh' of the gray dust go by the bed, but this time smaller, like a cat.  I actually had a gray cat then, but I looked over at him, thinking it was him running off, and he was laying on the dresser, sound asleep.  

I fell asleep one night, with the TV on, as had become my habit.  I remember waking up, and I'm not sure here if this was on the TV itself, or just something I was 'seeing', but in red letters, I saw 'Your fucking soul will burn'.  I think it was perhaps a dream, I remember being startled and lunging out of bed, but it was maybe the most intense moment of the whole experience.

Not long after that, our mom came to visit us.  I offered my room to her, but after these stories getting spread around the family, she opted for the couch.  Now, to add some context for this, my mom is a little odd, and always talks about seeing ghosts and spirits and whatnot.  But as I was walking out of my bedroom to get something for her, the door slammed shut.  The house was closed up for the AC, so there shouldn't have been any wind causing it.  I honestly didn't focus much on this at first, but the door was locked as well - something I never did because it was a pain in the ass to turn the little knob in the door handle.  I tried to find something to insert into the pin-hole to pop it open, and my mother (again, an odd one, nothing I personally saw) claimed she saw the 'dark figure' above me, laughing at me while I fumbled with the door.  I still take that one with a grain of salt.

After a couple more 'gray dust man' sightings, I gave up.  My brother called the Orange County Paranormal Society, and got them to come out.  Unfortunately, I couldn't be there for it - though they set up late in the night, I was in crunch time at work and didn't get home until 4am.  My brother told me they basically did the usual stuff you'd expect - walked around the house, had an EMF antenna, etc.  Nothing strange happened for them, but they did give me one HUGE piece of information.

I've always been the type who doesn't care how hot or cold it is, as long as I have airflow.  So, whether at my original desk in the living room, or at my chair in the bedroom, or at my desk at work, I had one of those little black Vornado fans blowing on me constantly.  I don't know about the one at work, but the one at home was, according to them, putting out a 1000 or so mG field practically right next to my head.  

From what I had read afterwards, that kind of exposure can possibly cause some of the issues I had been experiencing, such as the paranoia (in the sense of feeling a presence), insomnia, and so on.  And after months of exposure like that?  Who knows.  I stopped using the fan, and just like that, these things all stopped.

I moved across the country not long after that, but still feel the 'sense' of being watched all the time, though I thankfully have not had any more major issues.  

Anyways, **TLDR** possible paranormal experience caused by a faulty fan - but not entirely sure.

I once read that a 'poltergeist' could be explained as something being caused by a 'Living Agent' and by subconscious telekinetic energy.  This, honestly, intrigues me more than the 'spirit' theory.

OK, here is my story.  Two years ago I moved in with a girlfriend into an older house.  We were looking for a bigger place and I wanted to rent with her before i bought anything.  This girl, let's call her Jen, had some pretty bad emotional issues.  She had a hard time expressing certain emotions, would often throw things when she became angry, and screamed at the top of her lungs at me over nothing.  (We soon split when this became a daily occurrence because I couldn't stand the mental abuse.)

Before I continue I need to explain how to house was set up.  When you walked into the entrance you stepped into a vestibule.  The vestibule had two doors.  One door led to an unfinished basement with a washer/dryer/storage and the other door was the entrance to the house.  When you walked into the house you were in a dining room, with a kitchen to the left, a main bathroom further down, an entrance to a hallway to the living room and second bedroom and then a first entrance to the main bedroom.

One night she was yelling at me about how I was working too many hours in the dining room.  Out of nowhere we hear, and felt, extremely loud banging coming from right below us in the basement.  We stopped talking and both listened.  It continued.  It wasn't the furnace and it was random hits without pattern.  As if someone was hitting the ceiling of the basement with a sledgehammer. I literally can remember feeling the vibrations on the ground.

I went out to the vestibule and slowly opening up the basement door and flipped the switch.  The banging stopped when I opened the door.  I slowly crept down the first flight and braced myself when I turned the corner.  I didn't know what to expect, but was shocked at what I saw.

Nothing.  No one was there.  I checked every inch of the basement with Jen standing on the stairs.  I told her it was empty and to stand where we were before.  With a broom, I hit the ceiling of the basement with some force.  Jen told me it wasn't near what it sounded like before. 

I went back upstairs and turned off the light and listened before entering the house.  You could hear a pin drop.

I close the basement door and then close the main door behind me.  This door had a rather large window frame and a long shade covering most of it except the lower portion. 

We basically stared at each other puzzled.  I am a man of science and logical explanations.  About five minutes later, we near a noise again.  This time it was coming from the vestibule.

SLAM SLAM SLAM.  The basement door was slamming.  Again, their was not a rhythm and it was sporadic.  

We both jump to the floor and stare out the lower window.  Sure enough, that basement door was opening halfway and slamming shut.  Over and over.  I kept asking how this was possible.  Jen was terrified.  

I stood up to open the door and I could still hear the slamming.  When I opened the main door, I saw the door open again and then it just stopped.  Midway opening,  the door stopped.

I could not explain it.  It was not windy that night and it never happened again.

I have a hard time explaining what I saw and felt that night.  I did not feel scared.  I felt like I was witnessing something unbelievable.  

I still live in the house without Jen.  I never had an experience again after she left.  The house always feel calm and relaxing.  I can't explain any of the events that happened when she was there.  If there are spirits in the house, then perhaps they hated her.  A lot of people did.  Yet, maybe she was the one manifesting the events that happened in the home when she was living there.

It happened in my Granny and Grandpa's house. I would just like to point out that I had never felt/seen anything in her house before and never did after this, and my grandpa died about 5 years prior to this happening.

My friend and I were staying in the spare room on the ground floor of the house. I put my phone on charge across the room before going to bed and during the night it woke me up by beeping and flashing. I got up to unplug it and I felt arms tight around me. It didn't feel threatening though, it felt like a big hug. This really freaked me out though so I hopped back in to bed.

In the morning I told my Granny what had happened and she replied, ""oh, that's Grandpa. I often see him"". That's when I realised it was my Grandpa giving me a hug; it was a comforting experience.

My paranormal investigative team and I were in the car on our way to a site that we were investigating that night. These car rides can be long because we like to travel far and wide to investigate. As we are driving, we get on the subject of weird paranormal experiences that we have had in our lives and one of our new team members shared a very interesting story with the rest of us. He was in college (in the mid 90's) and one night his house mates were throwing a party. His room was upstairs and he wasn't in the partying mood so he just decided to study and hit the hay. He was pretty tired after a while so he proceeds to fall in his bed lazily with his head half off the foot of the bed to the point where he is looking upside down at his room. He opened his eyes and saw, what he described, was an eight-foot tall, shadow figure, with deep red eyes. My team member was too afraid to move so he just stared at the entity. He says the entity did not speak verbally, but was communicating telepathically with him, forcing all of these spite-filled and hateful emotions on him. My team member says that it's the worst feeling that he has ever felt.  This entity kept bombarding him with feelings of doubt and shame in many things from his past that he felt bad about. This encounter lasted about thirty seconds until either my team member rolled over or he shut his eyes and opened them again. I can't remember exactly how he said it ended. After that happened he stayed in his room for a while as he tried to comprehend it. Later that night he got together with his house mates to explain what happened and once he was done with his story, two of them had guilty/worried looks on their faces. The two housemates told my team member that they had come across a summoning spell for a Djinn in the ancient books section of the library of the college and they basically were just trying to conjure a genie to say hello to everyone in the house. For some reason the djinn only went to my team members room and was pretty pissed off. 

My team member says that he thinks what they conjured was an Ifrit/Ifritti (there are tons of ways to spell Djinn names) and I've exhausted all of my search engine hits on Djinn and the different types and lore behind them. I literally just searched Google for the rest of the car ride until we got to the place that we were investigating and I came up with some information, but not a lot. 

So has anyone ever had any experience with what they think was a Djinn or does anyone have useful knowledge of Djinn and those types of paranormal entities?

And now, it keeps moving around on its own. A few weeks ago, I woke up in the middle of the night with it under my pillow. I was freaked out but dismissed it as maybe just leaving it there. About a week later, i find it in my drawers under some shirts on top of a shirt that my step-mom got me from Greece with Leonidas the Spartan on it (possibly significant since Plato was an Athenian). So i dismiss this, maybe one of my roommates was fucking with me. I did tell them about it the first time. Then this weekend. I left Thursday for a weekend conference in New York. I left pretty early. I made sure the book was sitting on my desk. I had bought a lock for my door (there's a latch for a lock) and locked it, taking the key with me. I get back here today, grab my key and unlock my door. I open the door to find The Republic of Plato lying open on the middle of my pillow to page 227, the start of the Allegory of the Cave, which I had been discussing with some friends in my house about two weeks prior. The door was still locked. I don't have any windows. There's no feasible way anyone could have gotten in here. Not to mention, everyone went home this weekend. So, i am sufficiently freaked out. I've had very strange things happen to me in the past, but they've always been more or less explainable. This is really the tipping point though. I'm a very rational individual and I'm afraid this could drive me insane.

The graveyard shift is composed of two patrolmen, and dispatcher, who monitors the alarm software, security camera footage, takes after hours phone calls, and coordinates the patrol to whatever may be happening in the field. 

Since being promoted to the dispatch position about 9 months ago, I've spent a lot of nights all by myself in the large community center. Here's where things take a ""paranormal"" turn.

I've never had any experiences prior to this, but I listen to a lot of Coast to Coast AM, and I'm open to the idea that there's something out there. I take most things I hear with a grain of salt, however. I have a feeling that the lack of sleep on these night shifts, combined with hearing some stories of things that happen at night to other dispatchers and employees, it could just be the case of having the willies while alone in a big building. 

Some examples of anecdotal stories from other coworkers. . .

After a telling our janitor a couple strange things that happened, he shared some of his experiences.  One morning, he was cleaning alone and he felt a presence around him which manifested into a feeling that he was being touched on the shoulder. He said the feeling subsided when he said ""FUCK YOU, LEAVE ME ALONE!"" 

His other prominent story involved him seeing the figure of a recently deceased coworker standing in his office just before he turned on the lights. The lights came on, the figure was gone, but he swore there's no way he would mistake the shape of what he saw in that office as that of the coworker. 

Now, between myself and several of my coworkers, we have observed the following small happenings.  

-The elevator door operating itself as if someone was coming downstairs, or going up. I've heard elevators do that from time to time, but wouldn't that happen with some regularity? It's only happened to me once, and to one other coworker in the past 9 months or so. 

-Footsteps upstairs. Usually ending with a door opening and closing ever so slightly. Again, air pressure changes? Rodents? An old building settling? 

Last week things got a little wierd for a couple of us. On the Wednesday before last, I had to leave the office to assist with a problem our patrolmen were having in the field. We have an elderly woman who watches television in our lounge. I turned off the television immediately after she left and I locked the building up for the night. When I returned from the field, the television was on again. 

A few days later, our Tuesday dispatcher (who teases us for entertaining the thoughts that maybe something paranormal is in our office) actually called the patrol back to do a sweep of the building with him. He heard steps and a door closing, about 20 minutes after the elevator operated on its own. He thought I was playing a prank on him, actually, but I was at home sleeping. 

Last Wednesday, I was back on shift, and was strumming on my ukulele (which I do while monitoring alarm statuses and cameras- keeps me awake) and I heard the steps upstairs. I ignored it, and I felt cool air (A/C was off) as the hairs on my arm and neck stood on end. I kept strumming for a few more seconds, then I got on the radio and called the patrol guys (for a random field status update- I had to break the silence) 

So, that pretty much brings it to today. I decided to start small with checking this out. I put my laptop up there with a decent microphone and set it so my laptop won't go to sleep. The display turns off, but it will continue recording until I fetch it in a couple hours. Meanwhile, downstairs, I am taking notes of what I hear or if I do anything that might get picked up on the microphone upstairs. 

I hit record, said aloud ""I've heard someone walking up here, heard doors open and close, if you've got something to say, come say it into the green light, it's a microphone"" And then I walked back downstairs to do my job. 

This is an extremely amateur attempt, but I'm curious to see what audio gets picked up. I'll provide an update when I get to review the audio (more importantly, if I pick something up). As for now, I'm locked down in the building in almost total darkness with exception of the security light by the stairs leading up.

Usually at this time my son and niece are home upstairs playing. I heard people upstairs, little footsteps, so I figured it was them. I thought I heard a woman, which I assumed was my sister. I chilled for 10 more minutes and decided to go upstairs to get my son because there was a chance he needed his diaper changed.

I went upstairs looked around and all the lights were off, windows and doors closed. I heard some faint noise from my sister's room and figured she was watching a movie with my niece. I stopped to look around the living room a bit and then decided to go back downstairs. I was about to leave the door at the top of the staircase open, but decided against it as I still thought my niece was upstairs. As I went to shut it I felt something push the door closed from the other side. I felt a cold breeze which was odd since there were no open doors or windows. I  nearly lost my footing because whatever pushed the door did so with some force.

I just messaged my sister to see if she was home and she said no. She asked if I had gone into her room to see about the noise since she left the door open. I told her the door was closed when I went upstairs. So now the whole hearing kids walking around and a woman makes mo sense at all.

We have always suspected, well we've been pretty certain, that our house is haunted. Ever since we've moved in here we've heard a lot of things. We've had people over downstairs and have heard heavy footsteps above us and furniture being moved. When we run upstairs everything is in place and no one is upstairs. The house is small so even if someone left we would've seen it. We're the first people to live here, but the land has gone through many make overs so we assume a lot can be from that. Many times at night we will hear kids playing in the hallway, when there are no kids at home. I've even heard people knocking at my bedroom door at 2am. My sister has seen her door shake and someone turn the knob only to have no one there when she opens the door. She'll close it and it will happen again.

My first (and only) Ouija experience.,mrshemingway,58,20,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1famqp/i_still_dont_understand_what_happened_my_first/,"When I was 13 years old, I realized it was time for me to make new friends. The girls I grew up with were, for the most part, 'frenemies' who ruined my childhood. I made friends with a girl in my class, Cynthia, and her friends from another school (there are only two schools in my hometown). Cynthia was unlike the girls I grew up with: She could stand up for herself without putting people down. I liked that about her and immediately felt like I could trust her. The girls and I would often spend our weekends at Cynthia. That's where we had our first parties, our first drinks, and our first joints. 

A few years later, Cynthia's parents moved into a new apartment. They rented the apartment on the bottom, and Cynthia's uncle lived in the apartment upstairs. One Friday night, we were bored at Cynthia's and had no idea what to do. We lived in a small town and there weren't many places for young people to hang out. The bowling alley was closed, we weren't interested in hanging out at the skatepark, and the movie theatre played films that had been released over six months ago. 

Cynthia asked me if I had ever played Ouija before. I answered that I had never played before, but I would love to. Cynthia and our friend, Marie, looked at each other and smiled. ""We're gonna have to chance that,"" said Cynthia. I was excited! The girls told me they had played before and it worked. Cynthia's parents overheard our conversation and stepped in the room. ""You know how to do this honey?"" Cynthia's mom asked. The girls said they had played plenty of times on their own, and knew what to do.

We didn't have the typical Ouija board, but Cynthia's mom (Guylaine) said we could easily make our own. We simply had to write all letters of the alphabet, numbers 0-9, ""Yes"", ""No"", and ""Goodbye"" on paper. Then, we cut them all up individually to make a circle out of them. ""You're not playing that game in my house though,"" Guylaine warned us. She said we would be playing in the apartment upstairs. Before we left, Guylaine asked me to pick a letter without looking. The letters were all upside down, yet I was hesitant about which piece to grab. I finally picked up a piece of paper. It was the letter C. Guylaine looked at it, smiled, and said ""You're good to go"". She wouldn't tell me what it meant. The only possible answer for me is that C is the first letter of my first name. 

Cynthia, Marie and I went in the apartment upstairs. We set up the game as instructed: We made a circle out of the pieces of paper with the letters and numbers, and we put the pieces of paper that said ""Yes"", ""No"", and ""Goodbye"" in the middle. We didn't have a pointer, so we used a glass (upside-down) instead. We lit two candles and turned off the lights.

As excited as I was, I soon got bored. We tried to play the game for over 30 minutes and then gave up. We sat at the table and gossiped. Cynthia's parents eventually came upstairs and asked us how we were doing. We said that the game wasn't working and we weren't happy about it. ""You mind if we join you?"" asked Cynthia's dad (Sylvain). We sure as hell didn't, as the game wasn't working for us anyway.

Before we tried to play again, Sylvain gave me some ground rules. He told me not to ask questions about my future, to remain polite, and not to leave the room until we're certain the entity is gone. I smiled and nodded. 

We were now five people at the table, so we could only use and index and middle fingers to touch the glass. Sylvain then began the séance and asked if there was ""anyone"" who would like to speak to us. The glass would slightly move, but whenever it did we would admit that we were the ones doing it. Our arms were extended for so long that we would sometimes involuntarily apply pressure on the glass, causing it to move. 

Then, glass started shaking. We were all startled that every single one of us drew back. The glass was still shaking. It moved very little, but enough for us to notice. We looked at each other and put our fingers just above the glass again. It continued to shake. It seemed like the glass ""wanted"" to move, but it was locked into place. 

It started spinning in circles, and these became bigger and bigger. It was moving so fast that none of us could keep up with it. We were all staring at it with our arms crossed. The funny thing is that I wasn't even scared. I think I was relieved. ""It's all true,"" I would think to myself. I thought about how this could explain my experiences in my parents' home. It meant that I hadn't been imagining these things, and that everyone was wrong to tell me that I had a hyperactive imagination. I was happy.

The glass started doing figure 8s on the table. If I had a cellphone back then, I definitely would've filmed the entire thing. It was moving so fast and none of us were touching it at this point. I even checked under the table in case Cynthia's parents may have been playing a prank on me. Nothing.

When the glass slowed down, Sylvain began to ask questions. I don't necessarily remember what ""it"" answered, but it didn't make much sense. We couldn't put words together. Sylvain looked at me and asked if there was anyone I'd like to speak to. There was. I took a deep breath and asked to speak with my niece, Amina. Two summers before, Amina passed away at my parents' cottage. She was 7 years old. I changed a lot after her death. I was depressed and was also diagnosed with Anti-Social Anxiety Disorder. I blamed myself for Amina's death and felt like my family may have blamed me too. Long story short, we were walking on the beach with my dad. He told us that the area was dangerous and that we should head home. I followed my dad, but heard Amina yell my name. I turned around and she was in the water. I ran towards her, extended my arm to get her out of there but she pulled me in with her. The current was so strong that even my dad couldn't get us both out of the river. I was finally able to reach the shore, but by the time I could find someone to help us, Amina had died of internal drowning.

I don't remember if I asked for Amina myself, or if Sylvain did the talking for me. I just know that as soon as the ""glass"" pointed towards yes, I was terrified. I wasn't scared because of my niece, but I was scared because there were many questions I wanted to ask her. I was scared of her answers. Before I could ask any questions, however, I decided to test the spirit. I asked basic questions, such as ""What is my name?"" and ""How old are you?"" I wonder if she would still answer 7 if I asked her the same question today (she would be 21).

I finally asked her the question I feared the most. ""Did I do this to you?"" I asked. There was no answer. I looked at everyone. I was shaking. I was trying so hard not to cry. ""Was it my fault?"" I asked. The glass slowly slid towards ""No"". I was relieve. Sylvain asked me if I wanted to ask her more questions. I said I didn't know. He started asking her if was in Heaven and questions like that. The glass always pointed towards yes. For some reason, I felt as if I should continue asking Amina for proof that I was talking to her. I decided to ask her on what day she died. For some reason, I remember having the number 5 in my mind. The glass went to 5. I gasped. Everyone smiled. I then thought of the number 2. The glass went to 2. I stood up, slammed both hands on the table and yelled, ""NO SHE DIED ON THE 9TH OF JULY!""

The glass quickly went to 9.

I slowly sat down. I was angry. I was so frustrated I wanted to cry. I told Sylvain, ""I don't want to talk to it anymore."" We continued playing the game for a bit, but I wasn't very involved. I just sat there, looking at the glass move from one answer to another. At one point, Sylvain and Guylaine thought they were speaking with Guylaine's father. They even asked ""him"" to break the circle. The glass would point to ""No"", but it finally did. Sylvain firmly held the glass (still on the table). He had difficulty keeping it on the table, and finally pushed it back in the circle.

We finally went back downstairs. Cynthia's parents were sobbing and not really talking to us. The girls asked me if I was okay. I wasn't. I couldn't understand what had happened. If, at first, I was happy because the game seemed to prove what I had been telling my family for years, it left me with all sorts of questions. Did I really talk to my niece? Was I fooled by a spirit (who could obviously read my mind)?

We were driving past the forest at Bonnybridge in Scotland which is apparently very popular for sightings of UFOs in the sky and a man once claimed he was abducted there. It was around 11pm and the sky was clear... All seemed normal.
All of a sudden the radio cut out and there was plain static for all of the other stations which is unusual for that area and then it happened. Everything lit up, the sky was bright blue and mildly cloudy with the clock in the car still showing 11pm. Me and my mum started freaking the fuck out and then it went back to night. This repeated while slowly getting faster until the sky seemed to be flashing wildly from day to night. I think I was crying and my mum was trying to turn her phone on but it wasn't working. This was some seriously freaky shit. It suddenly stopped back at night after about 10 minutes and my mum drove straight out, seriously it was bloody weird! The next day there were no newspaper reports about it or anything. It was almost as if nothing happened but it did as me and my mum definitely seen it.

My grandfather rebuilt the house, knocking down all but one wall and expanding the foundation. I have lived here my whole life.

For my real issue, please skip to the bottom. Otherwise, continue on.

The first spirit that I want to let you know about is just a pesky guy that I called Till. Till seems centered on one room of the house, my old room that my brother now lives in. Till likes to knock things off shelves, hide keys and randomly turn on the radio. On three occasions when I was about 16, I awoke to him shaking the bed vigorously, even though it did not seem to move. I never saw Till, only felt and experienced him. Since I moved out of that room, Till seems to have gone.
The second entity we (my brother, myself and eight or so of our friends who have seen him) don't have a name for. We only ever see him in our upstairs hallway. He is a shadowy man about 6' 5"" in a long coat and wide brimmed hat. He floats (has nothing below his knees) down the hall slowly, looking into each bedroom, then glances into the living room at the end of the hall before vanishing. This happens at least once a month and that's all he does. He seems to just check on things.
In my basement are the other three.
Two of them are children. I remember playing with them as a child and recall their names are Billy and Amy. I don't know why they're there, but to this day on rare occasions you can hear their laughter as they run around the basement. There are no children near where I live. I have accidentally recorded this laughter one time on a tape recorder. I was on my way out and placed my stuff on the table down there (tape recorder included) and couldn't find my keys. I went up to find them, at some point accidentally turning the recorder on and after I go up the stairs, you hear my keys hit the floor followed by a little girl's laugh. My keys were on the floor when I came back down.

Here lies my problem:

The fifth and final entity we call ""The Wraith"", as it resembles one of the Wraiths from LOTR, however, my brother and I started seeing it when we were both young and before the movies came out. It inhabited in a side room of the basement that holds a tanning booth, weight set and a freezer. The weights and tanning booth are almost never used and the freezer is near the sliding glass door that gives access to the room. The glass of the door is clouded and sometimes you can see it glare out through the glass. This room has no lights and there is nothing to cast a reflection. Even being near this room will send chills down people's spines, and no one wants to be down there alone. Now, when I was a kid, my cousin closed me in there and I remember freaking out but not why.
That thing has been in there for at least twenty two years... until a month or so ago.

For the past three nights, I have been woken up in the dead of night. I have dreams, like a voice telling me something about a fire. I can never remember what exactly, but it tells me that the house is going to burn or I am going to burn or SOMETHING is going to burn. It wakes me up in a cold sweat, this dream, and when I wake I swear I hear a voice in my ears. But I feel like the Wraith is there, and it hasn't been in it's room for at least a month. Any advice is welcomed.

EDIT: Tossed and turned last night. Felt like there was something watching me all night. Tried not to get any REM sleep, as suggested, but still felt the voice in my head. It wasn't as strong, but it spent a good chunk of the night harassing me. It mocked and demoralized me. It was gone by the time the sun came up, and only then did I get some peace, but that didn't last long as I had to rise for the day. I'm off to ward the house, especially my bedroom. I want the Wraith GONE. I'm going to burn sage and throw some holy water around. Hopefully my wards stay this time. Will keep you guys updated, and thank you all for your help. The dreamcatcher is on it's way.

EDIT 2: After putting wards up around the house, doing a cleansing and grounding myself, I finally got a night of uninterrupted sleep. I think the Wraith may be gone, but it's too soon to be sure.

I worked nights at a bar and grill so I would get home late some nights (around 11 or 12). 

One night, I came home from work and as soon as I walked in the house, I felt something. I felt like someone or 
something was watching me from the corner behind the door, so I turned, thinking maybe my roommate was hiding there to scare me but there was nobody there. Then I noticed my roommate's brother wasn't on the couch (where he had sleeping). 

Thinking nothing of it, I started down the hall to my room. As I rounded the corner, my roommate came out of his room, and I asked him where his brother was. He told me Jed had been sleeping on the couch when something woke him up. He looked in the corner behind the door and saw the demon that had been following my roommate around since they were kids. 

I told him about my feeling upon walking in and he said he would feel better if he stayed in my room until I fell asleep. I was inclined to agree. So I'm laying in bed, with roommate chilling/dozing in the recliner in the corner, and I thought, maybe if I pray to the goddess (I was Wiccan), I'll have some protection. As I was praying, I felt like I was getting short of breath. Soon, it felt like there was a hand around my throat, choking me.

I was able to say my roommates name loud enough for him to wake up and as soon as he remembered where he was, he just started yelling, telling me the demon was standing beside my bed. He started yelling, saying 'Leave her alone! Come after me!' And ran out of the house. 

Shortly after, he came back in and before he even said anything, I could tell the demon was gone. To this day, I don't know how he got rid of it but I was never bothered by it again.

Also, both of my dorms I am talking about in these stories are renovated hotels. The first one was more of a motel, so separated buildings with 2 floors and the hallways are outside with railings. The second building has 6 floors and the hallways are also outdoors with railings. There weren't many stories such as murders and all of that in the first building but the second building gets stops on the tourist ghost tours to talk about how fucking haunted it is.

I'll go from the least creepy to the creepiest. (You know to build suspense and such.)

#1: The Sophomore Year Dorm Hooker Heels and Marbles Story:

This story is from my most recent quarter at school. I live in the 6 floor building I mentioned above. I live on the 6th floor and my girlfriend lives on the 5th floor right under me and two doors down. The 6th floor is supposedly the most haunted floor in the building because of one story about room 634. When the dorms were a hotel back in the day a hooker and her young son stayed there. They couldn't afford to live there so the drunken landlord would take sex as payment. She would always send the kid off somewhere so he wouldn't see. The son thought it was a sort of hide and seek game, hid for a bit and played with a set of marbles his mom gave him as a present. Well the last time this happened the landlord was more drunk than ever and she told her son to go hide. The landlord was getting to touchy feely and she wasn't diggin' it, tried to stop him, and he killed her. The son would hide in different places every time so this last time he went to the roof of the building. But as a little kid wouldn't know, the roof doors lock behind them. The kid died on the roof. The story is that you can hear marbles on your ceiling every once in awhile and you can also hear the hooker's heels in the hallways behind you or on the ceiling if you're on the 5th floor and down. About the time of the end of the quarter I was in my girlfriend's room before class at about 11am. Her neighbors upstairs who are two doors down from me always make a ton of noise so we usually didn't think anything of it but we heard the distinct sound of heels walking around. We joked about it and let it go. Later that day I saw the kid outside of his room and thought I'd ask him just to see what happened. He said no one in his room was wearing heels at all that day. I also hear heels all the time when I'm in my bathroom that sounds like they're from the hall but my roommate who's closer to the hallway didn't hear anything. i also hear marbles all the time on my ceiling.

#2: The Freshman Year Dorm Room Netflix Disaster:

Around the end of second quarter of our freshman year, my roommate and I fell asleep watching Netflix on our Xbox. My roommate woke me up in the middle of the night because the Netflix was going through movies by itself. We looked at both of the controllers which weren't in our reach at all and they were both completely off. I thought it was just a glitch but instead of a steady click noise going through the movies at a constant rate, it was stopping on certain ones, clicking them, and then going back to the menu to do it all over again with different movies and shows. 

#3: The Freshman Year Dorm Room Chair Story:

It was around midterms and my roommate and I were up late working on projects till about 2 or 3 am. At this point in the year we were still new to the whole dorm life and we were trying to keep the room as neat as possible, so we would push our chairs into our drafting tables before we'd go to sleep. We finally get into our beds, turn out the lights, and go to sleep. We heard footsteps outside our hallway but only by our door going back and forth. No shadows were going past our blinds which was a little weird. We shrugged it off and went to sleep only to wake up in the morning with my roommates desk chair in the middle of the room facing his bed.

#4: The Sophomore Year Phantom Car Story:

During the last week of school of my latest quarter, my roommate and I stepped downstairs for a cig around 2am to take a break from our final projects. We walk downstairs, see the security guard and no one else. We walk outside, where there is a driveway/parking lot type thing for people to pull up and pick people up or drop them off. There was absolutely no one outside and no cars on the road, obviously because it was 2am on Wednesday. The only thing we saw was a black honda probably from like 2000 pull up to the door right as we walked outside. We didn't think anything of it because it was just a car, we assumed it was someone's ride. We were out there for probably 10 minutes at the most and didn't notice anyone get out of the car or anyone get in the car from the building. Keep in mind it pulled up to the door right as we walked outside. We still didn't think much of it as we were walking inside. I go inside first and hit the elevator button as my roommate is standing in awe in the doorway. I was confused and all he said was get over here. I walked over and he said there's no one in this car. I looked in through the only semi tinted windows and saw the whole driver seat and steering wheel and all of the other empty seats in the car and then it drove off.

I'm so scared.

Last night, I took my dog out to the backyard to go potty for the last time that night before we went to bed (around 10 or 11pm). For some reason, my puppy wouldn't get off the porch so I kind of pushed him off the last step so he could hurry up and do his business. He began crying and refused to go further into the backyard (My backyard is huge and is completely dark at night with no lights other than the small porch light which can't reach the whole yard)  I noticed that my dog was crying and looking up.

Now on one side of my yard there's a huge tree (maybe it's oak? I don't exactly) that's probably a hundred years old or more with large branches that reach all across the yard and about half of my roof.

So I look up where the dog is looking and realize he's looking into the trees branches. The porch light is on at this point and illuminates a bit of the tree. My eyes immediately go to a certain spot high up and close to the trees trunk. There I can kind of see something. I'm not really sure what I'm looking at at first but I begin to feel really weird. There's this odd tingling sensation going all through my body and I begin shaking. The idea pops into my head that I should look away but I can't. As I stare more, I realize that what I'm looking at is an alien. I know it sounds ridiculous but please believe me when I say that I'm telling the truth. I begin to get so scared. I refuse to belive that it's actually an alien that I'm seeing and think that it's one of the tree's knots or something but then it BLINKS and MOVES. I get so scared and I grab my dog and run inside. I didn't go out that night again.

I felt so weird like my body realized what I was seeing before I could. I've never felt that way in my entire life. I spent the entire night pulling all the blinds over all the windows in my house and locking everything. I didn't sleep I was so scared. I still haven't slept.

The alien looked like a grey alien. I know it sounds insane but it did. It was more beige than grey and had these huge almond-shaped black eyes. It was staring at me. We stared at each other for a few seconds but it felt like a lot longer. I know that the grey aliens aren't supposed to blink (I read about it) but this one did.

I had a panic attack at soon as I got inside and I freaked the eff out.

Please somebody tell me I'm not crazy. I need to know if what I saw was real and what's it doing here? What was it doing in my yard out of all the yards possiible?

I don't live in rural America nor do I live in a small town. I live in one of the biggest cities in the world (Los Angeles) and I know I wasn't imagining it. Is it going to keep bothering me? Please somebody help me.

(Apologies for my bad grammar in advance).


It was a normal night nothing special or out of the ordinary about it. My friend and I were heading home from the movies and everything was good. Now my driveway is about a quarter mile long with 2 houses on the right side of the driveway and Forest on the left. So we turn into my drive way and my friend being the wise guy looked over to me and said, ""Lets see how far down the drivweway we can make it with out lights"". So he turned his lights off and continued down the drive way. About 15 ft in he realizes that idea was stupid and he turns the lights back on and things got strange.

Apon turning the lights back on about 20ft in front of us was a man, or something like a man.... He was knelt down, head staring at the ground hunched over almost on his knees. He looks as thought the wind had been knocked out of him. The figure was pale white and bald but the details from the initial sight of him wasnt very detailed. Now before we go on my friend drives a Dodge Ram 2500 diesal with an Air horn installed. So we are looking at this guy who appeared out of no where hunched over on his knees in my driveway and my friend slams the brakes and starts to honk his horn. One horn goes off and this thing didnt even flinch. And another horn and another and still this thing has yet to punch as it stay bent over almost gasping for air. At this point my neighbors come outside and start yelling at us to quit honking and he then notices the man in the driveway as well. I rolled downt he window and told him to keep his distance cause we didnt know if he was armed, or dangerous or ANYTHING! So he stands in his yard and start asking this guy if he was okay. So my friend gets impatient and puts the truck in drive and starts to in forward. As soon as he did this the man in the drive way started to move.

As we sit here and watch this guy get up my friend puts the brakes on again and lays on the horn. Now at this time the guy is having a hard time standing up but once on his feet in our headlights we could see him a little better. He was not normal. He stood at about 6'4 long slender body (Insert Slenderman joke) and unclothed. His arms were long and he had slim fingers. His face was peculiar too in the sense that his jaw was longer then usual and got narrower towards the bottum but not super narrow there was definition to his chin. His nose was small but his nostrals were defined and his eyes were small and close to the nose he didnt have much definition to his lips just the shadow of an upper lip. As to his package.... well there wasnt one not even so much as a buldge. The reason we later deemed him Moss Man was because all over his pale body was little green blotches everywhere like patches almost. 

So as he gets to his feet the figure stands tall and stumbles a little bit before walking towards the car. My neighbor at the time started to walk over and kept telling him he was tresspassing and he knew his rights (He was a Redneck). My neighbor yelled into his house to grab the gun which was about the time we figured we would get the hell out of there. As we are panicing with this strange thing walking towards us my friend slams it into reverse and hauls as out of my driveway and int o the neighbors yard where we hit a tree. 

After this happened it took about a week for me to go back home and to this day I wouldnt be caught outside of my house with out someone with me or something in my hand.

The building where I work is a unfinished building, they somehow just stop construction a couple years back. One afternoon I was riding the elevator with two of my colleagues and we had pressed the ground floor. It completely skipped the ground floor and took us to basement 6. As far as I know basement 4,5,6 were not in use and you can not even press it on the elevator. My colleagues and I taught it was odd, and we decided to go out and check it out anyways. It was dark and it smelled awful so we decided to go back up but by the time we tried to the elevator doors  had already closed. When we pressed the up button it would not light up, we were stuck. Good thing we all had Iphones, we just used the flashlights on our phones to find the fire exit. 


One of our colleagues who was a local was telling us that since we're deep underground we might see some unearthly things, I laughed it off and said as a joke ""Why don't you guys follow us, be my guest"". 

Later that evening I was at my studio apartment (I live alone). I was just online talking to my friends on facebook. I saw short black mist run in to the bathroom, I didn't think much of it because I was tired and I really didn't care. Next morning Around 4:45 am I was ready to go to work since I started at 5:00am.

I, still thinking it was a cat was about to approach it then this black shadow creature steps out of the umbrella. I was shocked, I didn't know what to think, just frozen as we both looked at eachother..It looked like a stubby little person, no bigger than a cat. It stood on two feet, had a big stomach and long arms with slightly long fingers. After I snapped out of it, while it still was looking at me I quickly pressed the elevator and went to work. I didn't tell anyone for a few days. One day my colleague who was with me in the elevator gave me a book on mystical creatures. As I was scanning through the book, one picture caught my eye.

(very long post),BezziVelinov,51,13,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/smeb7/skeptic_to_believer_in_one_night_all_it_took_was/,"I never believed in the paranormal as a kid and throughout most of my teen 
years.... until one night that made me a firm believer. I was a normal 16 year old high 
school girl. Made decent grades, played video games, hung out with my best friend and 
stayed out of trouble. I decided to introduce my best friend, Ali, to one of my favorite old 
school PC games: American McGee's Alice.... a totally morbid and macabre game based 
off the story of Alice in Wonderland. She loved the game almost more than I did. She 
would draw creepy pictures of Alice and the Cheshire cat, quote it and watch me play 
almost every time she came over. At this same time, she started to change. She became 
fascinated with the whole ""Wicca"" thing and started practicing it: Dressing in black, 
wearing pentagrams, even took a whole day of silence. I didnt understand or really ask 
about it too much... honestly I didnt care or judge, it was what she wanted to do.

One day she surprised me at school by pulling a figure out of her messenger bag of 
Alice, accompanied by the Cheshire cat. http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2145/2424936613_5cb82cd9a5.jpg Whoa! I thought it was the coolest thing ever seeing 
as I was a big fan. Actually, I was kind of jealous! I had no idea there were collectable 
figures. I wanted them too! A few weeks had passed and as always, I walked out of my 
Algebra 2 class to her waiting for me. She looked a bit uneasy and before I could say
 anything she handed me a note. I dont remember exactly what it said, but it was along 
the lines of ""I need to talk to you about something... privately. Not over the phone or in 
public."" Naturally, this alarmed me... I didnt know what to expect. Her step dad wasnt the
 nicest guy Id ever met... did he hit her? Omg what if he's doing worse?! All sorts of ""omg 
what if...?"" questions started whizzing around my head and made waiting for lunch almost
 torture. When I met up with her, she took me by the arm and led me behind the art 
building at the limits of campus. I proceeded to ask if she was ok... she said she was fine,
 but was very scared of going home. I instantly thought her step dad was being an 
asshole again. I hated the guy and was ready to pounce on an opportunity to give him 
what he deserved. She swore up and down that she wasnt making this up and if I didnt 
believe her, she'd show me proof...Then she began to tell me about her Wicca practices. 
Immediately I put on my poker face and listened. She told me about one particular 
practice that she did called ""spirit writing"", which to my understanding is pretty much 
inviting your ""spirit guardian"" to control your hand and answer the questions that you 
write. Of course the first thing that popped in my head was ""What the hell.... you scared 
the shit out of me for nothing"". I kept listening though... She told me the names and ages 
of her ""spirit guardians"", what they looked like, where they were from and just vast 
amounts of details about them. It seemed that one of them, who she called Suzanne, 
liked the Alice figure she had shown me a few weeks ago.

Ali's room was about 10x12 with her door in the corner, the parallel wall housing a book case, 
adjacent to the closet doors just a foot or two away. The bookcase was 
roughly 10 feet from the door and the floor was carpeted, keep this in mind... Ali told me 
Suzanne ""played"" with this figure everytime Ali would leave the room. Progressively it had 
gotten to the point to where she hadnt even stepped out of her door completely before 
turning to see the doll gone from its perch on the bookcase and at her feet.  ""Ok, shes 
lost her goddamn mind"" I thought to myself, just staring at her and trying to keep a 
straight face. I wanted to believe her, I really did, but come on. Spirit writing? An already 
creepy doll moving on its own? Whatever. But, she was my bestie and I couldnt find it in 
my disbelieving heart to call bullshit. So I told her I would stay with her over the weekend 
if it really scared her that much. I even offered to help her research on how to fix the 
""problem"" So the weekend came and I went home with her from school. As we walked in, 
her mom was in the kitchen cooking something that smelled amazing. I took Ali's stuff 
from her and carried it to her room as she started talking to her mom in the kitchen. I 
opened the door, tossed her messenger bag on her bed and turned to the bookcase. I slid 
off my backpack and put it in front of the closet doors like I always did. I straightened up 
and looked at the Alice doll that adorned the top shelf. I just... stared at it. Almost felt 
like I was making eye contact with it. Slowly I turned and walked away to join Ali and her 
mother in the kitchen.

We were talking and eating for roughly half an hour. None of us had left each 
others sight. Ali and I started talking about our art projects as her mom started washing 
dishes. I wanted to show her what I had done so far on my piece and hopped off the bar 
stool to go to her room. The door was ajar, just how Id left it. I had forgotten all about 
the Alice doll and its creepy vibe... until I walked in and saw immediately that it was not 
on the shelf anymore. I paused in mid-step, utterly confused. I spun in place, eyes 
darting all over the floor, trying to find Alice. I checked all the shelves on the bookcase, I
 looked under the bed, nothing. Finally I poked my head out of the doorway. ""Uh, Ali? 
Could you come here a second?"" She walked in and noticed what was wrong. She did the 
exact same thing I did: spun around looking, checking under the bed, going through the 
shelves, looking everywhere! Suddenly it hit me. I locked onto my backpack. ""No.... thats 
not possible...."" I kneeled down and grabbed a strap. It was almost painful to lift... but 
there it was. Alice was underneath my bag. ""No fucking way.... how the fuck?"" After a 
moment of well... just staring again, Ali let out a nervous laugh ""Do you believe me now?"" 
My mind ran through all the possibilities it could. ""The wind knocked it over. Someone put 
it there when I wasnt looking. It was there in the first place."" Ok, first off, the windows 
are closed. Secondly, I was with the only other people in the house the whole time. 
Thirdly.... well, I know that bitch was on the shelf the first time I came in. Ali placed Alice 
back on the shelf, with the Chesire cat in front as a prop. I sat in pure disbelief of what 
had just happened. I couldnt think of an explanation. I shook off my creeped out feelings 
and proceeded to do what I originally intended to do.

A few hours later, I completely forgot about the doll again. Ali and I were talking 
and drawing. Her mom popped in to tell us she was going to the store and as soon as she 
left, we bolted into the kitchen for icecream. We loaded up our bowls and returned to her 
room. Alice was gone again. But this time, I nearly stepped on her! She was at the 
doorway, nearly 10 feet away from the bookcase! ""What the hell!?"" I almost dropped my 
icecream and jumped back into Ali, almost knocking her over. She scooped Alice up and 
once again positioned her on the bookcase. Alright, alright! I believe you now! I was 
actually kind of pissed at this point. I wanted to know what the hell was going on. So I 
suggested we perform a few experiments on the bookcase. We bumped it, we threw 
things at it, blew on it, jumped really hard next to it, knocked the walls, opened doors, 
opened windows, EVERYTHING we possibly could to get this doll to fall and the only time 
it even budged was when I took my shoulder to the side of the shelf. Even then, it did 
not bounce on the carpeted floor. How the fuck was it getting aaaaaaall the way to the 
door and furthermore, UNDER MY BOOKBAG?!

The rest of the night, Alice fell off the shelf right on que as we left the room to help 
Ali's mom with groceries, when we went to watch TV, when we went swimming. Every. 
Single. Time. Sometimes she would be a few feet away, still in front of the closet, other 
times shed be almost in the doorway. We spoke nothing of it and just put her back on the 
shelf. I didnt want to think about it anymore, it was maddening trying to think of a logical 
reason. I didnt want to admit that it scared me and I DEFINITELY didnt want to admit 
that it might be a spirit or whatever moving this thing.

Finally, it was bedtime. Ali and I lay there in the dark, talking and gossiping like 16 
year old girls do, trying to stay up as late as we possibly could. It was cold, so we were 
under a big feather comforter... I loved that blanket. I was in the middle of my sentence 
when a rattling sound interrupted me. At first, I was confused... then I realized that it 
was coming from the bookcase. I completely froze... and I could feel that Ali had done 
the same. 30 seconds straight of no breathing or moving and the loudest pulse Id ever 
heard in my life pounding in my ears almost deafening me to the rattling on the shelf. Ali 
sprung up and yanked the chain on the fan to turn on the light. She leaped from the bed 
and snatched the doll off the shelf, yanked open her trunk, threw Alice in and slammed 
the lid shut, attaching a combination lock.Ali left her in the trunk for 3 months. When 
Alice was returned to the shelf, she never fell again. I guess ""Suzanne"" learned that she 
wasnt allowed to play with Alice anymore. The activity didnt stop there at all. Weird and 
crazy shit continued until almost the end of my junior year, but those are stories for 
another day. Even now, 8 years later, I can still recall the fear I felt perfectly that night 
and how it changed my whole life. Sometimes, I wonder if it'll ever happen to me again... 
and in some way... I hope it does.


tl;dr: Best friend starts practicing Wicca, her doll starts moving for no reason and scares the FUCK out of us.

**UPDATE: for anyone looking for further updates they will be available on my blog, however you can contact me here with a PM with any questions you have** 



Ever since I can remember, I have always seen ""Grey People""  ""Shadow People"" or ""The Dead"".

For years my parents thought it was just imaginary friends, but once I was old enough to actually explain to my parents what/who I was seeing they realized I was seeing people, dead people. (After i told them about my nana, who I never met b/c she passed 7 years before I was born.)
Other than my parents no one else really knows that I can see the dead and communicate  with them. But...

I see people everywhere, especially in the hospital I work at. I can feel their presence before I see them. I can hear them when I sleep. Sometimes they come to me for help other times they just look at me and continue to mettle about. 

In my last apartment, I held long conversations with a guy who passed while swimming with friends in a lake. His girlfriend lived next door, and he didnt want to leave her by herself. He was very nice and even helped me find my keys. 

I was little I told my mother that I died near a bridge we drove over. I think I was 6 or 7-ish. But I remember telling her about me being shot in the chest and leg, laying near a creek and dying. I described a very detailed vision of a battle field from the Civil War era? I was never allowed to watch Television that much when I was younger, and if I did it was always with my parents. I had never seen or read anything about that area, nor had I been there before. But my mom said it was creepy listening to me describe the things I was seeing, and that I was a man in this ""story"" as she called it. I asked her many years later where we were when I told her this. After looking it up, it turns out it was an old battlefield from the Civil War. 


In addition I want to add that sometimes I dream about places before I visit them. Houses/buildings mostly. I will dream about place, and then about a week or two later I will be driving or on a trip in an area Ive never been and bam, there is the place I had dreamed about. Its never anything significant, but I thought I would share that as well.


I just wanted to get this off my chest and see what some of you thought. 

I know some will dismiss this as a crazy persons rambles or a troll. 

But for you who are actually interested in what I have to say. Let me know.

I'm going to start with some backround. My sister got knocked up by a deadbeat (happened to be a family friend). He has seen his daughter once, maybe twice, the first few days she was born. Please note that we are dilligent on not mentioning his name, or much about him around her.
 About a year ago he was diagnosed with aggresive bone cancer and recently passed (RIP tony). Now this is where it gets odd. 
My niece has a notebook she draws in and for her age, she can draw fairly well. One drawing in particular (it was an obvious face, with what looked like facial hair, and something floating near the head) peaked my sisters interest. Now I was here for this part and nothing was influenced by anyone in the room. It was my mom, my sister, my niece and I. My sister asked her what the drawing was and she said ""tawney"" (my name is sean and she sometimes starts it with a t, so we thought she was saying ""seany"") so she asked her to it again, and again she said ""tawney"". My sister asked ""Seany?"" And she immediately shook her head and repeated ""tawney"". My sister then asked if she was saying ""Tony"" and she said yes. My sister then asked where she seen him and she said ""in my room"". Then my sister asked if she talked to him and she said ""yes"". When asked what they talked about she said ""barbies, he said my barbies were beautiful"". She then said he gave her a hug. 
Now when he died, he had a goatee and the picture did resemble that. I was really freaked and kinda happy when this all went down. I really don't think its a coincidence, as (like I said) we are very careful with what we say.

Over the weekend my friends and I were in Lake Tahoe hanging out by the water relaxing. We were planning on camping but we met this kid who was there for some wort of business and he was staying in a hotel by himself. We ended up gambling and drinking that night so he offered to let us stay in his hotel room. We accepted the offer. In the middle of the night he woke us all up because of a man that was in the room. He said he saw the man standing there and initially thought it was one of my friends because of the height of the man. He described him as wearing a white (almost 50's) style suit and a fedora hat. He said the man stared at him for a few seconds and walked into the restroom. He said he could here someone taking a piss in the toilet. The only thing is... nobody ever ended up coming out. He was terrified to open the door and when we did there was nobody in there. In the morning we asked the front desk if they have ever had guests describe any hauntings. Turns out the hotel ended up already being known for its hauntings of which we had no idea when staying there.

1375674372.0,36,self.Paranormal,1jpwz0,Just did a private 8 hour investigation at Waverly Hills on Thursday...looking for some input on an experience!,rhenzel,46,10,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1jpwz0/just_did_a_private_8_hour_investigation_at/,"Hi everyone! As the title says, on August 1st I, along with 11 other family members, did an 8 hour private investigation at Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Louisville! It was a very interesting time. I do believe I may have had witnessed one or more shadow people, and balls moving in ways that could not be recreated afterwards among some other strange things that I didn't give too much thought to. 

I have always been a skeptic, and so I am still not convinced I believe in spirits now, but this particular experience I had certainly made our entire group question things. So, I am here to share one particular experience with you and see if anyone has any kind of explanation for this or any other input. I would also gladly answer any questions from you all about anything regarding the general night at Waverly. Please keep in mind this was a PRIVATE OVERNIGHT and not a guided or historical tour.

During this particular experience, our group of 12 was split into half. I was in a group with my parents, brother, aunt and uncle. Each group had 3 walkie talkies so people could even split off into pairs if they wanted and the whole group could still communicate. The first group began their investigation on the first floor, and we began our's on the third, to give a little buffer so we could stay out of each other's way. We tried EVP sessions, using EMF detectors, grid lights, and a whole bunch of other things that really lead us nowhere. We went up to the fourth floor and tried there for a long time too, with the same results. At about three hours in with absolutely no activity, some of the group started to get frustrated. Obviously nobody knows if ghosts actually exist, and if they do, you can't make them do anything on command, so we weren't expecting instant results, but my aunt and uncle had been on about 4 different ghost hunts in other well known haunted places (The Queen Mary, Mansfield Reformatory, and others) without ANY sort of findings afterward, so they really regarded Waverly as the end of the road for their investigations if they didn't find anything.

We just sat there for a minute making jokes and trying to lighten the mood for ourselves, and my dad said ""We can sing Kumbaya or something if that's what you wanna do"" to make a joke, and we laughed. We tried a little longer, and nothing happened still. We decided at this point to go downstairs and meet up with the other group so we radio'ed them and told them we would be coming down shortly.
We packed up our equipment and started walking to the staircase when my dad said ""I firmly believe there are no ghosts at Waverly Hills."" And we all started joking with him that he was going to piss them off, and not to provoke anything. Shortly after, the radio went off. There was a girl singing an old song on it. We thought it was someone from another group even though it didn't sound like any of them. My uncle keyed back ""What?"" and the singing started again. It was on everyone's walkie at first, and then it would cut it and sort of bounce between them, one at a time, and then settle back on all three again. He said ""What?"" again and there was more singing. When the song finished, she broke out into Take Me Out to the Ball Game. 

We decided at this point it must be a kid on the same channel we were on since it was open with no encryption, and we switched everyone over to channel two. We laughed that it was the creepiest thing that had happened thus far and went downstairs to meet everyone else and the guide who was with them. We mentioned something about the singing, and they had never heard it. They could hear my uncle said ""What?"" each time, and heard us say to change to channel two, but nobody at all had any idea what we were talking about. Luckily my dad had a voice recorder on and he played it back for everyone.

I just uploaded this to soundcloud so I could send it out to everyone from our hunt, and thought I would upload it here too and get any thoughts you all have on it. This is 100% unaltered, and it was not done by anyone in our group. We did think for a while it could just be someone else on a walkie talkie, but only us in that room heard it, and it was just an odd coincidence after we had been joking and singing just moments before. [HERE is the soundcloud recording,](https://soundcloud.com/rh330/waverly-singing) let me know what you think! And I would love to answer any questions. 

Also, we listened to it again earlier with better headphones and at about 2:28 you can hear someone say something that we can best make out to say ""You need to practice, little lady.""

It's in a VERY small village (one crossroad) and it gets extremely quiet. The pub was built in the 1620s (so it's pretty old) and happens to have a floor made out of limestone stolen from some abbey ruins down the street. I would be surprised if [this](http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4020/4319266888_80c4e3d726_z.jpg?zz=1) place WASN'T haunted. Anyway, back to the pub. As barmaid, it is my job to shut everything off at night and close the place up. This includes putting the cellar to bed. Pub cellars are usually located underneath the bar, but for some reason ours is in a different building on the other side of the beer garden.


One night (about 4 months ago) I was shutting up the pub, when something felt strange. I had turned off all the lights (it was pretty dark but still light enough to easily see where I was going) and I thought I saw something out of the corner of my eye. I looked over and it was gone but I was really scared. It REALLY creeped me out and I felt like even though the thing only existed in my peripheral vision, it was still there and very real and it wasn't leaving. So I decided it would be best to hurry up. I go outside and am unlocking the cellar  when I feel like I've seen something again. I dropped the keys TWICE (really unusual for me) before finally getting inside the cellar. The cellar is DARK. I have to feel along the wall to find the light switch (which is located behind a shelving unit) and as I'm reaching I feel like something has brushed up against my arm. I flipped out even MORE and felt a really strong urge to run out of there but instead found the light, flicked it on, turned everything off in the cellar, and left. Promptly. I then lock up and RUN to my car. When I get in my car and turn the headlights on, I can definitely, without a doubt in my mind, see a figure standing outside the cellar. Just a shadowy silhouette, but it's not that dark outside, not dark enough for my eyes to play tricks on me like that.


This all happened awhile ago. So yesterday I finally asked my boss why the cellar was located in another building and he responds by explaining how the cellar under the bar was too small and difficult so they moved it in the 1920s to where the mortuary used to be. That's right, the MORTUARY. The building that currently houses the cellar used to be a mortuary. I don't know a lot about real paranormal experiences and ghosts and whatnot, but I know what I saw, and now that I know what the building used to be, it has just reaffirmed in my mind what I already knew to be true. So what's the next step? I will have to continue going in the cellar every night, alone in the dark... Should I try to communicate with the being I saw? Should I be scared?

Under a few boxes of random stuff, I found my mom's Ouija board. I know the stories about the boards and know how it's usually not a good idea but curiosity got the best of me I guess. However, my experience wasn't seemingly evil or malicious or even that big of a deal, but I am wondering what others will think of it.

I took the board out into our downstairs living room and sat on the floor. My friend was over and she was so scared of it that she went out into the yard and refused to come in until I was done with it. I didn't really mind so I said hello,  and asked if someone was with me. It said yes. I asked, ""What's your name?""? And it went to the G. At this point I started to feel uneasy and decided that I should close the session. I moved the piece to Goodbye, thanked any spirits for their participation and dismissed them, and even though I'm  an agnostic (or so I think, it's complicated for me) I said a quick prayer.

It was at this point that I realized that the board was glow in the dark. I picked it up and went into my closet that's under the stairwell, just to see it glow. When I shut the door I was shocked to see three finger shaped areas on the board opposite to where I was holding it that were not glowing at all. Remember I'm in a pitch black closet with a glowing Ouija board, staring at this hand print that shouldn't be there, so yeah I was pretty freaked out.

I tried to debunk it right away by gripping another side of the board and letting go, thinking maybe it was the heat from my hands or maybe the oils on skin or dirt or something making it not glow, but I couldn't replicate the print on the board, no matter what. This was when the fingers faded, not all at once but one by one. So it went slowly from three fingers, to two, then one. During this time I was yelling for my friend to come inside and look, but for one I don't think she heard me and I don't think she would have came even if she did, not that I blame her.

My phone was also out where I was sitting with the board, so I knew I couldn't get to it fast enough to try to film or take pictures of the ""hand print"" on the board. After it was totally gone, I got out of the closet and put the board back in the storage room. I was a little shaken up for a while, but then soon forgot about it until now, and I wanted to know what someone else thought.

I was watching a movie with my family in the living room, while a doll sat next to a lamp about 3ft to the left of me. I was the one to the farthest left, and kept glancing at the doll because I had a feeling like when someone is standing near you. Every 3-5 minutes I would look over to the doll because the feeling of being watched grew. It was very disturbing but I just tried to ignore it. About 20 minutes passed since I started looking at the doll. I then decide to turn once again and that's when it happened. The doll turned its head towards me and just stared at me. I just jumped up and my whole family was wondering what happened. After I told them they didn't believe me of course but they did decide to put doll on storage room. About a month passed and I found out that my dad had donated the doll to an orphanage for christmas. The following Christmas, we went back to donate more and the nuns didn't want anything from us. They told my mom that the doll traumatized some girls at the orphanage, and they accused us of practicing witchcraft. No details were given of what had happened, but I knew all along something was wrong with that doll. Do you guys believe in dolls being possessed?

So first I'm going to explain a few details, of what led me to do this investigation at my grandmas senior complex. I didn't have room to put it in the video as I know attention spans and I myself wouldn't want to sit there and read paragraphs and paragraphs of text, the amount mounting to what's written below this. There are 3 links in what I'll just call, a jumbled journal. One of them being the audio/video, which I'm going to post below this, you can choose to watch it first, or read this first, it's up to you but reading all of this is key to understanding why I chose to investigate this place and a pretty strange occurrence I had there, with a lot of other ""self occurrences"" that happened to me, my dad, and my grandma when we lived with her at her previous senior complex. The other links include an Aerial photo of the complex, and a street view photo with references to my walk and an experience I had there.

YouTube Link:

(if you can, pause and read the first part of the description before watching)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWiUV3y2dfs

The EVPs I've found in the audio so far are..

* **""BURNED YOU""** 

* **""NO, GET OUT""** 

* **""LOCAL? HATER""**

I believe the word ""Local"" is said before a pretty obvious ""Hater"" you'll have to decipher yourself but I'm fairly confident that I've interpreted all of the EVPs correctly, I still have about 35 minutes of recordings left, one session is on the first floor very late at night in the rec room from the same day before heading back home. 

The text in the video is pretty much a short version of things I've included in our jumbled journal here. This was the first kind of ""trial EVP investigation"" I've ever done, I'm pretty sure I'm the only one to ever investigate this place and I chose to do so for a few reasons. I call it a trial because that's pretty much what it is, I wanted to test the waters before bringing better equipment in and pushing further, I really wasn't prepared for what I caught but who is I guess, studying the Paranormal isn't new to me, but investigating it is. My mind is very open, however I always try to find an explanation for everything, and in this case there literally is no other explanation as the place was and is always super quiet, everyone keeps to themselves, I was the only one walking around. 

I lived in another senior complex where we, (my dad, grandma and I) experienced some pretty creepy things, so we'll take a look back at the things that happened a few years ago in my grandmas old complex, as they didn't just happen to me. She never really gave an explanation to why she wanted to move out, it was a nice place but I just figured she grew tired of it, and maybe the landlords, but she seemed to never really want to be alone, now it's the opposite from what I can tell at least.

The experiences I encountered there.

One night I fell asleep on the couch watching T.V and I woke up in the bathroom standing up in total darkness, I put my hands in front of me and around me and thought I literally thought I had died and went to hell or something because I could neither feel, nor see anything, the T.V had been shut off and there was no noise. I had NEVER EVER walked around during my sleep, to this day I wonder what in the world happened for me to do that and just how long I had been standing there.

It didn't just happen to me though, my dad would did the same thing on numerous occasions and talked to me, once he went into my grandmas room while she was sleeping and start talking to her and mumbling about things that made no sense. I remember her waking up asking what my dad was doing, he was standing there up against the dresser.

One night I heard banging on the walls but had no clue where it was coming from, it seemed like it was left, then I thought it was right, or maybe straight.. it just seemed to be there, as a sound in no particular direction which is very odd for a senior citizen complex as the people are just very quiet in general.

This continued for 2 days straight, a few days later an ambulance came and from what I saw, I believe they took a body because it came out with a yellow cover over it and I saw what looked like ""body lines"" protruding from beneath the cover.

Not to long after, maybe a week I was sleeping, got up and was in a form of sleep paralysis, but it wasn't really, my eyes were open, I could move but it was like someone was leaning on me with all their weight while I tried to move as slow as possible but slowly went back to the position I had been trying to break, my eyes began to roll into the back of my head and it was just extremely creepy, it freaked me out for days.

My bathroom in the back master always felt like I was being watched when I showered, right where the previous banging sounds seemed to be coming from, it had a crawl space above the bathroom, like a large attic that had a small crack but all you could see was darkness and there was no light source. My dad and grandma were getting sick all the time, dad was hospitalized twice with pneumonia and everyone developed these crazy coughs, my grandma has Emphysema and her cough was the worst ever, now it's barely ever heard. I live in CA by the way, it's never really cold where I live so the pneumonia was pretty odd as we always kept the house warm for my grandma. These were the craziest things that happened, the little stuff is very debatable, lights going on and off all night and day, stuff missing, etc, etc. 

I try to ALWAYS use a skeptic side when I encounter things like this, some EVPs I see on the Paranormal T.V shows or YouTube channels like HuffParanormal we've heard are just the mind agreeing with what's being shown, other cases they're just extremely obvious so I was very curious to see what my own findings would be if I tried this out. I took my Samsung Netbook, opened up Audacity and hit record, explained to whatever/whoever is there what I was doing, said a quick prayer for some kind of protection just in case, you never know, and that was it, I made it to the 2nd floor on this session and later down in the rec room which I have not reviewed yet.

There was one detail I left out of the video that really made me want to investigate this place more than just what I experienced at my grandmas old complex.

We live not to far from my grandmas, it's maybe 10 minutes away, a quick trip down the freeway and you're there. One day my dad and I came over to pick up some stuff she had for my dad so I just waited in the car.

For referencing, this is the Aerial view of the complex and surroundings.

* http://i.imgur.com/TRnI3GN.jpg

I'm a pretty curious guy, so I like to people watch and know what goes on around me, so as I sat in the car I was just looking at the windows trying to kill time and I noticed an old man in a very old/nice suite looking out of the 3rd story window, not a space, not an apartment uni, there's a picture for reference below. I watched him for a few minutes thinking he would move, he didn't budge an inch, he was locked on to something in the distance. 

Strange but nothing really THAT out of the ordinary, it's a senior complex after all.. until what happened next. First I should mention, the bottom of the window this man is looking out is about 4 ft. from the floor. Out of nowhere a little girl possibly around 6-8 years old pops her head around the back of this mans head and directly looks at me, the man looks to be around 6 ft tall, and for a brief 2 seconds if that she disappears. For a very brief moment it seemed like she came to the side of his head, went to hide again like she'd been seen, then completely disappear.

The way she did this was almost sideways, like she had been sitting behind his head and just decided to peek over really fast, it was the strangest thing to see, in my head I was like whaaat in the wooorld just happened here... the angle and the way she did it was impossible, she would of had to be around 6 ft. 5 to do this and even if it was someone on a chair, the chairs throughout this place aren't like that, they're all the same, very small and you sink in when you sit on them, very low, lower than the bottom of the window at 4 ft. The guy didn't move an inch when this happened, then he looked over at me and stared me down for 5 minutes until my dad came out and we left, it was really crazy.

I know a lot of faces at this place as I'm there a lot to visit and help my grandma, I have never seen a little girl or elderly tall bald man in an expensive suite. Usually people are in the rec room downstairs to do everything, I will be investigating the 3rd floor next with a Blue Yeti Microphone, very sensitive. I figured I would hold it and run the USB to my Netbook in my backpack while recording, that way I'll be more mobile and won't look crazy holding a bright screen talking to the air if anyone looks at me weird.

Here is another reference photo of the events that happened, you'll also get to see the window where I saw the man and girl. The complex no longer looks like this, everything is ""darkened up"" now, this street view must have been right when it was completed because it doesn't look that nice and the paint and surroundings are darker now.

* http://i.imgur.com/YSMD5LP.jpg


That's pretty much it for now everyone, if you made it this far I really appreciate you taking the time to look at and listen to everything, like I said.. I'll definitely be going back and I'm also going to find out what the reason for turning it into a senior housing complex was, the ""BURNED YOU"" EVP really makes me wonder if there was some sort of fire, who knows, I'll post more if anything else in the rest of the audio turns up, so that's where I'm at now, thanks again.


**UPDATE**

8/5/13 

I was just going through the rest of the audio from my walk and it's incredible what else I caught, I had no idea, I should of listened to this whole thing a few times first. I'm getting direct responses to stuff I said or am doing, a name of someone.. like I said below, it's like this place is alive. I will be doing a night investigation there tomorrow with a nicer mic as I'll be staying over and I should have the new video up with the new audio I've found before I leave.

Does anybody else have this? I've done some research and ""claireaudience"" comes up often. The weird thing is, it's mostly negative thinking- I hear the lies people (that I don't even know) believe about themselves and it's said in their own voice, as i pass them by. 

It's also either if they have thoughts regarding their impression of me OR if we're mid conversation, and they're telling me a lie (or their thought process trails off elsewhere) I hear the thought audibly, as they're speaking with me. 

I've even heard my girlfriend say something over Skype.


It doesn't scare me at all, though- In fact, I find it intruiging as hell.

I don't know much of the buildings history, but I have heard stories of a few spirits that have manifested in the rooms.

And just down the road from us is a pub that claims it is ""the most haunted building in town""

Whilst working I've seen things out of the corner of my eye on occasion, but never really thought much of it and just thought my imagination was being colourful.

Onto my story,

Yesterday (7/7/13) I was cleaning our bar area at around 4am when from behind me I heard a genderless voice announce ""hello"" which wasn't unusual as we often have guests moving around at all times of the night.

I turned around to offer my greeting to the person, but when I did nobody was there and all I saw was some sort of arm/hand type thing moving towards me about waist height.
I recoiled in shock, and closed my eyes for a brief moment, when I opened them again there was nothing there.

Confused I walked around the area, checking the doors which were all locked.
This confused me more and with this I went upstairs to our front desk and spoke to my colleague Stuart about what I had seen.
He was perplexed about the situation as I was, and could offer no explanation for what I had experienced.
It also transpired that no guests that we knew of were walking around the hotel at that time.

Today, (8/7/13)
I've just been cleaning out restaurant area, and it's not uncommon for the floor to creak underfoot or the glasses on tables to jingle as you walk past them.
But tonight I've again heard and seen things I cannot explain.
As I was happily mopping away, a headphone in one ear so I could listen to music, I heard a loud-ish clattering sound, similar to that I would hear if someone placed a tray of dirty plates in our pot wash area.

I looked into the kitchen expecting to see my colleague Stuart putting things away, but there was no body there.
Confused and curious I walked around the area to find the source of noise, and could find no evidence of any plates, trays or anything that would have made the noise.

I shrugged it off and went back to my mopping, passing a few tables as I walked.
I got back to the mop and carried on cleaning.
It was then I noticed in my peripheral vision a man in a black suit and white shirt, stood at one of the tables I had just passed.

He was stood in such a way that it looked as if he was talking to someone in the empty chair.
I blinked and looked up.

There was no trace of the mystery person.
I looked around the entire area and couldn't see anybody or anything that could have passed me without me seeing them.

This has just happened to me, not more than 10 minutes ago.
To say I'm a tiny bit spooked is an understatement.

She was playing with colorful post-it notes in the shape of an arrow. She made a mess of them on the floor and as I kneeled to pick them up, there was a little pack of them (around 40 arrows still stuck together) that slid on the floor towards me as if someone gave them to me to pick up. (Everybody was in the kitchen at that point,  I was in the living room.)

They were to the left of me, and slid towards my knee.

Some background as to why I believe this was paranormal; my fathers's wife had an 18 year old daughter who passed away in 2001.  She never met my daughter of course, and I strongly believe it was her helping me picking stuff off the floor!  

I felt a strong feeling of wtfuckery for about 20 minutes after that. My dad's wife asked what was wrong, I described what happened, and she calmly said: you're definitely not alone here! And she resumed playing with my daughter.

I since haven't experienced anything 'paranormal' for eight years and perhaps I won't again.

I think it's important to mention that whilst I am not closed to the possibility of paranormal phenomena, I am aware that the human mind alone is responsible for many supposed encounters and can be mistaken for processing naturally occurring phenomena as something else. 

Perhaps my experiences can be explained as such, I would not be disappointed to discover they were, but intrigued; as an atheist, I do not believe in an afterlife, the existence of a soul and any form of conscious intelligence behind 'ghosts'. I do however subscribe to the notion of scientific theory proposing alternate dimensions and the undiscovered possibilities of our own conscious.

'The little boy' is the first encounter I had with the unknown and I will document the others hereafter. I would be interested to hear your opinions or theories about any possible explanation(s).

I was visiting a friend who was temporarily staying with his dad, his dads gf and her teenage son in an affluent part of Glasgow, Scotland. The house was a large, handsome terraced three story Georgian town-house in a leafy crescent. After an evening meal in the house with the family, my friend and I went to a nearby pub for a few pints and returned before midnight.

I was staying in the spare room in the downstairs part of the house that also contained the master bedroom and my friends room. I fell asleep soon after I got into bed but woke up unusually early as the dawn light started to come through the blinds (it was summer so was quite bright). I don't think it was the light that woke me however for standing in the middle of the room was a small boy who was looking at me and smiling.

He looked around the ages of four or five, had fair blonde hair in an old fashioned 'bowl' type cut and was wearing a white button-less shirt/smock top and a pair of brown shorts and had no socks or shoes on. He was holding his hands up towards me, which were cupped as if he was hiding something inside which amused him as he was smiling.

I remember this clearly as he was completely solid, not transparent or smoky. I didn't feel scared at all, he was just a cute, mischevious looking wee boy. I sat up in bed and heard myself asking him 'What's in your hands?' I say heard because there was a very strange feeling about it all, it seemed absolutely real to all my senses yet there was a 'thick' feel to the atmosphere that made it almost dream like (I have experienced both lucid dreaming and sleep paralysis and this was definitely different) 

At that point he opened his hands and I seen he was holding a small mouse. He laughed then moved towards me then released it under my bed. I twisted round and looked underneath the bed where I couldn't see the mouse, when I looked up the boy was gone too-he had completely vanished!

I felt strange, I looked at the digital clock-it was normal (when lucid dreaming digital readouts do not make sense for some reason) I got up, looked under the bed again, checked the room and looked out the door:the house was totally silent.

I figure I must have dreamed it, albeit of a very realistic and odd nature which I had not experienced before. Although my mind was racing about it, I felt very tired and fell back to sleep after around 10-15 minutes. I was woken up about 10am by my friend and we went upstairs for breakfast, I did not at that point remember the experience I'd had earlier.

His dads gf was dishing up a cooked breakfast as I sat down at the table.As she was putting items from the pan onto our plates her son was talking to my friend and said something about a rat. My mind flashed back  and I said 'hey, I had the weirdest dream about a wee boy and a mouse, he was...'

At that point the gf froze as she was dishing up. She looked at me completely seriously and said 'Did he have blonde hair, a wee white top on and shorts and was barefoot?' I confirmed that this was how he appeared. She said 'You've seen the wee boy who lives here then, your the third person who's stayed in that room that has, I've seen him as well'

I got a shiver up my spine and felt instantly like what I saw was no dream. It was then that my friend said he'd not seen the boy but often he felt like as he was going to sleep he could feel someone stroking his hair. The teenage son also confirmed he'd heard the boy playing and had also seen an elderly woman in the house. My friends dad hadn't experienced anything at that point (he would later) and was gently mocking us.

I have since met a friend of the gf who seen the boy as well when he was staying there. It seems the house was quite active, my friend didn't like staying there and moved out. I'd like to reiterate that I never felt the presence was threatening and neither did those who lived there. My personal opinion is that there is some quirk of time or reality to the house where previous residents cross paths with the current ones.I think perhaps some people are more attune with it than others and it is also possible that unconscious, dreaming minds can 'tune in' to it.

I know this was a long message so thanks for reading until the end. If anyone is interested in other events that occurred in the house or would like to see a photo of it, I will post more.

**Plain Old World**

Nothing supernatural here, folks. Anything ascribed to the ""paranormal"" has a perfectly legitimate scientific explanation, whether it be hallucinations, swamp gas, weather balloons, barn owls, etc.


**Slightly Mysterious**


An eerie howl in the woods, an inexplicable set of tracks, an unidentifiable shape in the sky; *something* unexplained occasionally crops up on the edge of society, but such appearances are ephemeral and fleeting at best. 


**Magic Is For Real**

A hefty helping of the occult and supernatural. Ghosts exist, and can and do toy with mortals for their own inscrutable purposes, though actual communication and apparition is very rare. Telepathy, voodoo, rituals, mediums, psychics, Wiccan magic, ""energy healing"", dowsing, remote viewing, all that psi jazz-it all works, though frauds still abound and actual powerful practitioners are rare. Almost anyone can develop one of these talents given belief and enough time; nobody is ""born"" with it. 


**Close Encounters**

That ""weather balloon""? Yeah, not so much. UFOs *are* piloted by little green/gray men from another world. People are snatched out of houses and probed, crop circles are plowed in the ground, aircraft are shadowed and sometimes outright abducted. Major world governments know, and the MIB are keeping things under *very* close wraps. 

**Creature Feature**

Crytpids are very real. Despite their often impressive size, they are incredibly good at avoiding detection, and their appearance is very rarely publicized. 

**Monsters Are Out There**

Think *Buffy*, *Supernatural*, the World of Darkness, or *Dresden Files*. Not only is magic real, but so are the monsters. *All* the monsters. Bigfoot, werewolves, vampires, Nessie, ghosts, wizards, Mothman, warlocks, and witches, any cryptid you'd care to name; they're everywhere. Priests battle demons with holy fury and necromancers make the dead leap up and dance at their whim. Governments might know, but they're mostly in the dark too; it's the supernaturals who are running the show. The paranormal in society operates a lot like it does in the universes mentioned above, or even in our modern society; most people don't know or don't believe, and though the weird and wild abounds, it is naturally adept at lurking in the shadows. 

**I Want To Believe**

Everything you read about is real. Extraterrestrials, monsters, magic, mutants, classified prototypes, curses, cryptids, secret government experiments, global conspiracies, shadowy meetings in smoky rooms; it's all out there. Basically, *X-Files*. There's a lot of people who know, or at least suspect, but the governments are doing their best to cover things up. 


So, which reality do you prefer? Myself, I think I'd like something like the ""Magic is for Real"" scenario. Enough mystery and wonder to keep me satisfied, but not too much of the really scary stuff. Monsters and the idea of genuine aliens observing us scare the hell out of me.

What is your take on it?,BlueRainstorm,43,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/xfvsy/all_my_life_this_has_been_happening_what_is_your/,"I’m apologising beforehand for the **MASSIVE** read. But it’s nearly everything that happened to me, and I want your guys’ opinions and advice on what I should do.

So ever since I was little, I’ve casually seen things around the house. I remember at my original house, one my father built himself, I saw this beautiful lady walk down the main flight of stairs. After describing her, my father said he had seen the same. You know how children are.. sensitive.. to this kind of stuff? Well my parents told me that when I was two years old, at that same house, I was sitting in my highchair one dinner, and just lifted my plate of food up in front of me, as if I was offering it to someone. Except my parents of course saw no one. And they said that I was staring intently in front of me as if someone was there.

Anyway, when I was older, around 6 or so, I was sitting on a children’s wooden chair in the kitchen, bouncing my baby brother on a [baby bouncer](http://www.google.com.au/imgres?q=baby+bouncer&amp;num=10&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=664&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=31XweTI-5N_4zM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.bebeonline.com.au/blog/category/rockers/&amp;docid=WudGHPK6Pk_RDM&amp;imgurl=http://www.bebeonline.com.au/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/08/babybjornsilver.jpg&amp;w=500&amp;h=332&amp;ei=Tn8XUK3HNo6ziQeVtoGIBQ&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=rc&amp;dur=578&amp;sig=102984396251390387791&amp;page=1&amp;tbnh=132&amp;tbnw=182&amp;start=0&amp;ndsp=22&amp;ved=1t:429,r:19,s:0,i:172&amp;tx=120&amp;ty=67)  . I got up, walked 10m to my mother in the laundry to ask her something, and suddenly heard a crash and crying. I turn around and saw my brother lying on his face on the tiled floor, crying, and still attached to the bouncer. My mother said that he must’ve tipped it over himself, except how could a 6month old baby have managed to somehow lean all the way forward, to tip the bouncer over? Mind you, this was 12 years ago also, so the bouncer we had was set leaning backwards even more than shown in the photo above. And I remember whilst running over to my brother, a sudden empty basket sitting next to the wall, completely toppled over onto the ground, upside down, without anything touching it.

So 3 years later, when I was turning 9, we moved into our new, and current, house. I remember seeing shadows and figures CONSTANTLY whilst growing up. At that young age, I freaked out all the time. But now, as an 18 year old, I’m just used to it. Anyway, I remember when I was 9, lying on the top bunk of my bunk bed, I looked outside my window at night. I saw these two dark silhouettes, standing next to the rose bush, around 7m outside, from where I was inside. The one on the left was taller than the one on the right, I remember. I felt like they were watching me.. and I felt for some reason that if I swore at them, they would go away. So in my head, I called them some kind of swear.. and they.. glided.. towards me! I ended up hiding under my covers and that was that. Also in that same room, I had this lamp on the bench next to me, where you tapped it to turn the light on. One tap, it got turned on, and was dim, the next one, brighter, the third tap, even brighter, and the fourth tap would turn it off. Well back then, I read a lot, so I’d use it a lot. And many nights, I would suddenly wake up, and find the device on, yet on the highest setting. 

The thing is, it doesn’t turn on if something, like fabric, eg. taps against it. I tested it myself by trying to tap it on with my hand through my sleeve. Wouldn’t work. And lastly, I had my arm hanging off the edge of the bed one night, and I felt someone hold my hand. I was only half asleep, so I woke up, called for my sister who slept below me to ask why she held my hand, and found that she was fast asleep.

A year or two later, I remember being in the study room, talking to my sister and my father. As I turned to leave, I saw this face pressed up against the inside of one of these clear, yet coloured, storage boxes that was sitting on the side of the corridor, just opposite the room. I remember vividly – easily one of the scariest things ever – this face; it was a female head, somewhat grimacing at me.. like it was laughing at me because it knew I was scared. It looked like it was decaying, with dirty, ratty hair spread out in the box. Even though it was only there for a mere few seconds, that image has been burned into my brain. I remember that I was so scared that I actually screamed in fright and refused to sleep in my own bed that night, since my room was just behind it.

When I was in Year 6, so a couple of years later, I was working on an assignment in the same study room, one night. The curtains were open, and I casually looked outside the window. As I did, I saw this very dark silhouette.. glide.. it seemed like, past the window, very casually.

After that, I sort of stopped seeing things around the house. Every now in then when I was in high school, so around 12 years old, I would see random figures and shadows around the house, once or twice a year. Then suddenly, last year in year 12, it all changed.

Towards the end of the school year, so around August, I was the only one awake at night, and decided to go to bed. It was around 10.30 at the time, and I decided to go pee before I went to bed. I went to the toilet, and whilst on it, heard heavy-set footsteps outside. Firstly, take note: Imagine a horizontal line, and divide it into thirds. On the left, there is the laundry, which is on the corner of the house; the middle, the toilet, and the right, the bathroom. I heard these footsteps walk around the bathroom’s corner, crunching on the leaves, walk over to behind me, where I was on the toilet. Then it stopped. It was as if someone was standing behind the house, and behind me. I even heard heavy breathing. Being silent, I listened for a minute. Nothing. So I quickly finished, flushed, washed my hands and woke my father up, saying someone was outside, since that was my original thought. He ended up going outside, yet to find no one. The thing is, we heard no running/walking against the crunchy leaves outside, which were EVERYWHERE, once all the lights were turned on. Which is impossible, for the guy to have left without making noise. 

There is a tall fence surrounded our yard, apart from a short fence opposite that same rose bush, where I thought the man came in. My father later confessed to me that he too thought it was something paranormal at the time, but didn’t want to scare me.  Since the toilet light was on too whilst I was using it, I’d have thought that someone trespassing would’ve stayed away from that area, instead of being so noisy right next to it. So, after having found no one, and searching all outside, and hearing nothing, we gave up and went to bed.
Here’s where it starts to get creepy. A few nights after that event, I again heard heavy-set footsteps against the crunchy leaves outside, yet at around 1am. I was in my bed at the time, and heard the footsteps on the lawn outside my room, walking around the house. I woke up my father again, we investigated, and found/heard no movement or anyone. From then on, every few weeks, I would hear this same walking outside my room. And then I started to hear the heavy-set footsteps, which I sounded like a well-built man wearing work boots, walk against the cement porch outside my room. Soon, it was finally 2012, and I still heard the same thing. It began occurring almost every second night. And soon, heavy breathing accompanied the footsteps, as well as things outside being moved. (we have heaps of boxes, some metal poles, loose items sitting on the porch ever since we moved in, that were our items from our old house that couldn’t fit in this house) So firstly, I would hear boxes being hit against/tapped, and even someone shifted. Then a few weeks later, I would hear the metal poles clunking and being moved around. And in order to get to these poles, you have to awkwardly make your way through the boxes until you get to the “middle” of the boxes, etc. (my little brother made a “house” hence the weirdness of everything’s placement.

Then at around April or so this year, I constantly saw dark figures and shapes move around the house. Saw ones in the corridor, in my parents’ bedroom; saw one walk from my sis’ bedroom into my (different) bedroom. (I nope’d when I saw that and stayed in the lounge for the rest of the day, lol). When I started seeing these figures regularly, the occurrences from outside had since stopped.

(real, not in a photograph).",,45,12,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/vo4ue/white_orb_of_light_real_not_in_a_photograph/,"This has been occurring for as long as I have lived at this house and both my sister and brother have witnessed it. My sister and I witnessed it together and we talked about it the next day, so it cannot be a dream. I've seen it the most and was the first to see it, my sister has seen it almost as many times as me and my brother has only seen it once.

There is an orb of light that randomly appears in our house at night. The last sighting of it was last night and my sister discovered that it cannot be photographed (she showed me the failed attempt). It happens maybe once every few months.

This is a description of it, which sounds like nothing I've been able to find online.

* It does not move, ever.

* It is always on the floor, never floating.

* It is the size of a softball and it glows brightly, but does not cast much light on surrounding objects. It is about as bright as a light bulb, but is casts as much light as a candlelight.

* It is far away from a wall, usually in the middle of the floor.

* It has been upstairs, in the basement and on the steps from the basement.


The cruddy part is that this orb cannot be photographed, which makes it different than the typical paranormal thing. I thought it might be ball lightning, however, it is never storming when one of us has witnessed it. Also, it does not move and there is no smell.

None of us has tried to touch it, because we don't know if it's safe.
Feel free to ask more questions, because I'm interested in what r/paranormal thinks about this.

**UPDATE**

Okay, so I got to talk to my sister about it. It was near a desk, so she got up and took a picture.
It didn't work, so she took the nearby rolling chair and rolled it through the ball of light. She said it went through it, but it didn't make it go away. After she was completely creeped out, it went away like a dying candle flame after five minutes of disturbing it.

I had a very intense and very real experience at work a couple of years back.  

I am in the first floor of a 3rd floor building.  The 3rd floor is where the executives are and every Wednesday at 7am I have to go upstairs and join them in the 3rd floor conference room for a big meeting.

This particular morning it was just before 7am.  I was the only one in the first floor and walked out of the first floor and was walking towards the elevator (yeah I know, I should take the stairs) when clear as day I hear someone say ""I'll be there"" just inches from my ear.  

It was kind of breathy, somewhat otherworldly, and definitely very out of place voice.

I immediately ran to the elevator, turned my back against it and was frantically pushing the Call button.  There was nobody in the lobby.  As soon as the elevator came I ran in and hit the Close button to shut the door.

It was freaky and disturbing but I got over it and forgot about it until the following week....

My company had recently let go of a long time employee.  Just a few weeks earlier in fact.  He had been with the company for years, before I started but had fallen into alcoholism after some bad personal shit went down.  The company had tried to help him out but finally too much was too much and they let him go.

He had been an attendee of that Wednesday meeting for years....

The week after my ""I'll be there"" incident his former boss received a call from that employee's father.  He had been trying to contact the son and hadn't been able and finally called police to go check on him.  When they arrived on that Friday they found him dead in his couch.  

The coroner concluded he had drank himself to death... and estimated the time of death sometime late Tuesday, early Wednesday.

When I heard that story I suddenly remembered the voice I had heard that Wednesday morning.  And I was able to put 2 and 2 together as to what it could have been.  He was trying to make the meeting!

Holy shit.

Still kind of freak out about it to this day and since I'm in IT I get to be here at all times of the day/night sometimes by myself and I always wonder... will I have another experience?

Recently, however several weird things happened that forced me to re-evaluate my stance upon such things. The first was roughly 8-10 months ago, when I walked into my house after a late night walk (during this period I often met a girl at 1am and walked around with her til 4/5ish). I got in at about 3am, walked into my kitchen and turned on the kettle and I was leaving the room when I heard a distinct click. The only way I can describe it as a very loud knuckle crack. I turned around and found all my cupboard doors, and over wide open. They immediately slammed shut in unison. 

This incident shook me, but I reasoned that someone else in my house had left them open and the wind had blown them shut. Later, when I was moving from the same house, I followed someone inside the house, who stayed just ahead of me, and subsequently disappeared when I reached the end room of the house. I can't explain this. 

The most recent incident (and there have been many this year) was just a few days ago - I was in the kitchen (at my new house) and I felt someone tug on my arm. Before I turned around I heard someone say, incredibly clearly ""Could you pass me that please?"".

I've never had any paranormal incidents before, yet this year I've had so many the frequency has alarmed me.

About 4 years ago I was laying down for bed, and I had been in my room for probably 10-15 minutes, when my bed started shaking violently for 2-3 seconds. My friend was sleeping in my living room at the time and I got out of my bed and went and slept in their afterwards to say the least, lol.

Anyways, about a week ago I was laying down once more, and I had my dog next to me. I heard my dog sit up and look towards the end of my bed. She let out a low growl, and I opened my eyes and looked to see what she was growling at. It was dark in my room except for the moonlight shining in from the outside. I saw what appeared to be a black figure, with no face. It was like a mannequin of sorts. Taller than my dresser. I dismissed it and figured I was just seeing things. I layed my head back down. Curiosity got the best of me and I took another peek out of the corner of my eye. It was still there. At this point I sat up in my bed, my dog was still staring at it. I sat there and looked at it, telling myself it wasn't real. It then started walking around the corner of my bed, towards me. I jumped up as fast as I could and turned on the light and it was gone. I had done no drugs of any sort that day. I eventually just went back to bed after a few hours, and have seen nothing like it since. 

TL;DR - Black figure appeared at the end of my bed, then started walking towards me.

I've always been somewhat more perceptive of things around me, but by no means am I a paranormal magnet. But one strange thing that happened to me when I was much younger (about 9-10 years old) will never escape my memory. I lived in an apartment back then and my room looked out into the hallway that connected the rest of the rooms. It was pretty late at night when I heard whispering loud enough to wake me up. I figured it was my parents going to bed or something, and when I looked out into the hallway, I saw two vaguely humanoid shapes standing by the doorway, having what looked like to me a conversation with each other, but I couldn't distinguish any intelligible words. The weird thing is that the shapes actually had some color to them, a purplish tinge with the area that would be their face a deep blackish shade. They were there for a good 3-5 minutes just talking until they gradually vanished, or I couldn't distinguish them from the darkness. Here's a visual interpretation of what I saw (mind you, I am no maestro painter, but it gives you the idea of what I saw.)

This island was hit very heavily by the 2004 tsunami. Upon our arrival, my Thai uncle had arranged for his buddy to come pick us up from the airport/take us back to the airport at the end of the trip. This friend of his also runs a taxi service on the island, using a large passenger van. For the purpose of this story I will refer to him as Khun S. 

The following experience did not happen to me. This story follows the experience of Khun S, as he told it to us while taking us back to the airport. Needless to say, we were glad he told us this story as we were getting ready to leave the island.

Khun S explained that ever since the 2004 tsunami hit Phuket, locals have had sightings of unexplained phenomena. They'll see ""ghosts"", especially from one particular hotel near a beach. This hotel is completely abandoned now. Nobody will go near it. When people died from the tsunami, their bodies were stacked in front of this hotel. Thais are very superstitious, so you could blame this on paranoia, I suppose. Other surrounding condos and apartments near that hotel were left half-way built. Nobody will continue to fund the construction of a building that is near that area where the dead bodies were stacked.

Khun S then explained his own personal encounter. Late one night, when he was off duty, he drove his van over to a 7-11 to grab something to eat. A little ""ding-dong"" noise will chime every time a customer enters/exits the store. He entered the store, and that little chime went off, which is completely normal. He was the only person in the store other than the store clerk, who was busy stocking items and not paying attention to Khun S. However, multiple chimes soon followed Khun S, indicating that more people entered the store. But no one else was in there, other than Khun S and the store clerk. As Khun S went up to the counter to pay for his items, the clerk asked him if he came with anyone else. Khun S said no. They both shrugged it off and said good night.

Khun S drove home that night, and nothing happened. 

The next day, Khun S ran into a friend who also drives a taxi. His friend said, ""I saw you working pretty late last night. Where were you taking all of those people?"" This really puzzled Khun S, because he did not transport any passengers late the previous night. His friend elaborated that he saw Khun S's van was full of passengers. 

Completely freaked out, Khun S suspected that some ghosts were hitching a ride with him, and subsequently followed him into that 7-11.  

I'm not sure what to really believe, but I just wanted to share the spooky tale. With so much death that happened to that area, it makes you think twice. I lived in Thailand when I was younger, and I have some strange personal stories to tell, but I think I'll save that for another time. This is my first time posting to this subreddit.

Thanks for reading :)

1359151000.0,34,self.Paranormal,17a3os,You'll See Him Soon,HandBanana1780,59,25,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/17a3os/youll_see_him_soon/,"It all started when I got a case file on my desk (I work in the DA’s office).  A young woman was arrested after she was found in the home of a neighbor about to stab their young son.  The police report had some really weird parts to it.  
[Cop] was patrolling this neighborhood in a bad area of town in the early evening.  He was nearing the end of his shift and was about to head for the freeway when, as he described, ""I felt like I just had to make another round."" Instead of turning onto the freeway he makes a U-turn and heads down the road he just passed when he noticed a young woman climbing in a window of a house with a knife.  He flips his lights on, radios for backup, and runs up to the front door of the house.  He starts banging on the door and identifying himself as a police officer.  He tells me that he hears screams from a male and two females coming from inside the house and something to the effect of ""Don't do it! Stop!""  Just as he is about to attempt to forcefully enter the house (cops can do that if they have reason to believe someone's safety is at risk) the door opens.  There stands a woman screaming for him to help and she leads him into the living room.  There, he sees a man with his young son in in arms running around being chased by a young woman with a knife.  The officer once again identifies himself, produces his stun gun, aims the stun gun at the young woman, and orders her to stop.  When she ignores him he fires the stun gun, hitting the young woman square in the chest and arrests her.
Later, I get the psych report and it's seriously creepy.  The young woman told the shrink that after she lost her baby she wanted to contact him (hence the ouija board).  She says that she was contacted by a spirit who told her that he could bring her son back to her.  The young woman agreed and followed its instructions.  She caught and killed stray dogs, drew a pentagram in their blood, and arranged the skulls around a mirror so that she could better talk to the spirit.  When she had everything arranged she called to this spirit and he appeared in the mirror.  She said he wore a black cloak, was very tall and had piercing red eyes.  The young woman and the spirit talked over the course of a few weeks. It told her that she had to find a living vessel for her son's soul for him to be reborn. 
At the plea hearing a few days later I see the PD and she informs me that the young woman has agreed to take a plea.  During the entire time the judge is going through the plea the young woman is staring directly at me with a blank look on her face.  This is weird as most defendants blame the cops for arresting them and don't really pay the DA's much mind.  But she just keeps staring at me.  Finally, the judge gets done with the legal rigamarole and sets a date for sentencing.  Just before the young woman is led back to the holding area she says ""[my name] he says you'll see him soon and [my cousin] says hi,"" turns to the cop who arrested her and says ""you'll see him too.""  
Now, it's not weird that she said my name, I state my name for the record in court and in full view of the PD and defendant.  What is weird is that I have a cousin who committed a brutal murder before taking his own life.  I've only mentioned this to one of my colleagues and I've never said his name.  
That night, I got back to my house I watched TV for a few hours and went off to bed.  That night I was subjected to the most harrowing experience of my life.  I woke up in the middle of the night to a loud crash.  Getting out of bed, I walked over to my dresser and retrieved my gun, disengaged the safety and checked to make sure that a round was chambered.  
As I open my bedroom door and step into the hallway I notice the temperature in the hallway is at least 20 degrees colder than my bedroom.  I continue down the hallway, first opening the door to my bathroom then flipping on the light.  Nothing.  The next door is my office.  Nothing.  At the end of the hall way there is a dividing wall with the kitchen on the left side, leading into the dining room. The living room on the right and takes up the other side of the house.  The light switch for the kitchen is on the left side of the dividing wall.  I switch it on and see nothing.  When I get into the dining room and flip the switch on it's even colder than it was before.  I start hearing my name being whispered but I can't tell what direction it's coming from.  Slowly, I walk up to dividing wall and put my right shoulder up against the wall.  Just on the other side of the wall is the light switch to the living room that sits above my couch.  I take a deep breath, raise my weapon in my right hand and use my left hand to pull myself around the wall and flip on the lights.  
My living room is large, it opens up from the dining room side to the couch with the light switch above it, a couch on the other wall to the left and a pair of recliners in the middle, all facing my TV and entertainment system on the far wall.  As the light comes on I scan that area first, take a few steps into the living room and turn to my right near the fireplace on the far wall.  
That's when I see it.  Standing in semi-darkness is a hooded figure nearly 7 feet tall, nothing in the hood visible save for two glowing red orbs.  The smell of rotten meat hits my nostrils nearly gagging me.  Behind it and to the right I can see the hallway light was off.  The kitchen lights flicker and go out.  My stomach tightens and my hear feels like it's going to beat out of my chest.  Sensing my fear, I can see the red orbs in the hood glow brighter.  The kitchen lights go out and the far side of the living room grows darker around the entity.  Then, with a voice like a thousand screams in unison it speaks.  
""He was mine,"" it said.  I couldn't respond.  I was frozen with fear.  Some distant part of me remembered the pistol in my hand and I managed to pull the trigger.  The gun clicked but didn't fire.  Nothing.  Then it began moving toward me.  Not walking, but gliding across the floor.  It raised it's arms revealing hands with four claws instead of fingers the flesh white and cracked like an old statute.  It spoke again, this time in a low groan, ""Now I take you.""  Then shot towards me.  I'm not sure if I said it out loud or just thought it but the last words I remember were ""God help me.""  

As it crossed the 25 feet between where it was and where I was standing I stumbled backward and fell onto my couch against the dividing wall near the dining room.  Then, the dining room light, which was still on, brightened to a level that was blinding.  A new voice boomed ""YOU WILL NOT!"" and the last thing I remember before passing out was a blinding light racing toward the dark entity and crashing into it at incredible speed.  

I woke up the next morning in my bed.  I immediately shot out of bed, grabbed my gun from the dresser, and ran through the whole house, checking every room.  After the adrenaline wore off I slumped into my chair and cried for what seemed like hours.  I called in sick to work that day, went to my local church and told the priest everything.  He agreed to come over that day and bless my house.  

Some time later I asked the officer he had experienced anything weird after that day in court.  He told me he hadn't and I didn't share my experience with him.  Maybe it was a dream but I don't think it was.  I can't rationally explain what happened but I believe that I was saved by either God or an angel that night.  I've never experienced anything like that since and I believe that whatever the dark entity was it was defeated.  From that day forward you'll find me in church every Sunday.

Her mother for most of her life was a chronic schizophrenic drug addict who cut herself regularly and attempted suicide on several occasions. Although her mental state had improved the last few years she still struggled with drug use. When they found her, she had been dead for about a day to day and a half range so it was even harder on the family. My wife believes that her Aunt and Uncle were not 100% honest with her (One admitted that drug paraphernalia had been found near the body, one would not) and wonders if she had in fact committed suicide. My wife is fairly religious and like many religions believes that when someone commits suicide they will go to hell which has her really upset. A couple of nights ago my wife prayed for a sign that she was OK or at rest. Nothing happened. The next morning her dad (who had been divorced from her mother for several years called and told her about a dream where he was in bed and looked over at a chair that is near and my wife's mother was sitting there. She asked him if she had seen her lately and he explained to her that all her children had been able to make it to her viewing and funeral but he had not been able to and he was sorry. She replied ""That's nice"" and began to fade away. At that point he woke up but could still see that she was fading away in the chair. Now here is the really weird part. A few minutes after she hung up the phone with her dad. Her phone rang again. The caller ID showed ""Mom"" and displayed her number like it always has. By the time she got over her shock and answered it had stopped ringing. She immediately called the number back. The number is disconnected and out of service. Now I believe that each of these events could be explained away as her dad just having a dream or some crossed wires at the phone company but to occur at close to the same time just hours after the fact that she had prayed for a sign has kind of gotten me thinking. What do you think? Has anyone had any similar experience? Coincidence or not I think it is actually helping my wife begin the healing process.

I have always been fascinated (sp) with the paranormal.  As a kid, I loved watching everything I could find on TV about it.  When I was about 13, my family bought some ground and built a house on it.  We loved ths house so much.  About 5 years later, my moms mom, who I call my granny, was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  She stayed on her own for as long as she could, being a very independant woman, but finally moved in with us so we could take care of her.

I have to admit that the 6 months that she was with us was very hard to watch.  She went from being very active, always running around the house talking and spending time with me and my younger brother, to just laying in bed, looking at the ceiling.  Finally, it got so bad that she had to be placed in a nursing home, where she died 16 days later.

Now, I tell you all that to tell you this...

Weird stuff started happening almost immediately after her passing.  My mom had a painting in our hallway, held up by a nail pointing up at appx a 45 degree angle.  One morning, the painting litteraly hopped off the wall and fell in the floor.  My dad and I went to go look and see if the nail had moved or fell out of the wall, but it was still exactly where it had been put.  The only way the painting could have done that is if there was a force acting upon it to push it off the nail.

The next thing that happened occured several nights later.  My brother and I share a room, so oneof us is always walking around in there.  I was laying in bed, reading a book, when I heard footsteps walk into our room and almost right up to my bed.  I look up from my book and no one is there.  I figured my brother, who was in the livingroom next to our room, had gotten up and it had sounded like I heard footsteps.  So, I go in the livingroom and ask him, but he hadnt moved in a few minutes, so that wasnt it.  My parents were asleep, so no one had moved.  

Two strange occurance also happened to me while I came home to visit my parents during break from college.  On one occasion, I was almost asleep, when my bed suddenly felt like someone had sat down on the side of it to talk with me.  I was laying on my side facing away from the edge, so i figured my brother had sat down on the bed, so i rolled over to talk to him, but no one was there.  There was a clear indention of someone sitting there, and it was very cold to the touch, but I was alone in my bed.  The second time, I was almost asleep, when the corner of my blanket flew back and something very cold grabbed my foot.  I freaked out and pulled my leg to me, but nothing was there either.

All of these things have made me a true believer.  I have tried every way I can think of to replicate these events, but I can't.  Like Sherlock Holmes said (Me paraphrasing) ""Once you've ruled out all other options, what ever you are left with, no matter how implausible, it the answer.""",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_15ko7c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/15ko7c/my_haunted_house/,

I moved in about a year and a half ago (although have since left the flat). 
The first story that I have is one that didn't happen to me, but happened to my flatmate, Gabriel, a year or two before I moved in.
He was on the computer late at night, alone in the house. His parents who owned the house had moved to Australia at this point, and his sister Marina was out for the evening, but she was due home in an hour or two. 
He was sitting in a desk that was positioned in front of a window. This was in the second half of the house, the house was set up so that both sides had a kitchen and bathroom so that the house could be locked from a central door and rented out as two separate properties. He was enjoying himself on facebook or bebo or whatever social media was popular at the time. 
All of a sudden he felt a pressure on his hand. He looked down to see a grey hand quickly retract itself from his hand and recede through the window. 
He went to the door and looked out, shouting ""Marina I know you're there!"", assuming his sister was playing a prank on him. No one answered. He grabbed a flashlight and had a look around the property. It was situated at the end of a reasonably long driveway so he checked the drive first. No one there. He checked around the sides and the back of the house. No one there. The bushes that surrounded the property were over two meters tall, and they were not strong enough to support a human climbing over them.
He went back to the computer to grab his phone and call the police. Someone had been trespassing on his property and being only 17 or so, and a bit of a wimp, he wanted protection if someone was trying to harm him (this wasn't the best neighbourhood, and he had neighbours who were constantly arguing and who he believed had a gun). 
When he hung up the phone with the police he noticed something odd, the window had a security latch on it that allowed the window to be only 5cm open maximum. He tried to fit his hand through the 5cm of open window and he couldn't fit half his hand through, let alone his whole arm. 
The police arrived and searched the property. Throughout the commotion Marina arrived home and wanted to know what the hell they were doing there. Gabriel explained and she told him to stop being so freaked out, that it was probably just his imagination. Their parents came back a few weeks later and locked that side of the house, as it contained a lot of their valuable stuff. They knew the kids were getting to the age when they would have friends over and didn't want anything broken/stolen.

A few weeks after I arrived I told them I had a weird vibe from the house, like something else was there. They told me about the homocide/suicide of the couple who lived behind the house. The husband apparently murdered the wife and then killed himself. They said they believed that the ghosts of the murdered wife and husband sometimes came over to haunt the house. 

The room I had had blackout curtains, you couldn't see anything in the room at all, apart from the little LED light on my charger that would give off a dim red light. I would hear footsteps in my room, turn on the light and there would be no one there. One time I had two friends staying in my room, one on the floor and one in my bed. We all heard a painful moaning coming from the open closet, I asked the friend on the floor (nearest the closet) to turn on the lights and check, in case it was one of our cats. There was nothing there. The moaning sounded so human, I just clung to hope that it was an animal and not an ominous supernatural being. My friend turned off the lights and the moaning continued. I asked him to close the closet door. The moaning continued, just quieter, more muffled. I eventually willed myself to sleep.

Not long after that I would hear voices just before I went to sleep. I'm told this is normal, just your mind dealing with the things it has been exposed to that day. The disturbing thing was the voice that would scream my name: ""Victoria!"" Just before I drifted to sleep. It would always wake me up in a panic. Always the same deep voice of a man in his mid to late thirties. 

I bought fairy lights and would sleep with them on most nights.

I had a conversation with my flatmate, Marina, about how I found it hard to sleep. I told her about the voices and how I would hear my name just as I was about to sleep. She said to me, ""Is it a deep voice? Does it sound like an older man, and he only says your name and nothing else?"" I said it did.

This is getting quite long so I will continue it in another thread.

This happened about 5-6 years ago, i had a friend (lets call him ""Steve"") who bought a cheap pre-pay phone(the ones where you have to buy the card thing for minutes) so Steve used it for a few months until he was able to afford a better one. Anyways, the cheap pre-pay phone wouldn't send or receive calls or text messages unless it had minutes, once he re-uped on his minutes he would receive the missed calls and txts. So Steve left the phone in his closet since he didn't need it anymore, but he left it on. One day it received a txt message that didn't make sense like random letters. The message didn't have any reply or delete options and didn't have the time or date at the bottom or anything and after he would open, read, then close the message it wouldn't save in his inbox.  after a few weeks the random words started to make sense like ""why"", ""hello"", and ""not those shoes""but the messages didn't. Steve thought it was weird so he would always recharge the phone and leave it there. it was three of us that would always hang out at Steve's house and one day we were just chillin listening to some music and we got a random txt from the phone ""turn it down, your moms getting mad"" and sure enough his mom knocks on the door and tells us the music is a little too loud.  We were both amazed and creeped out. Then it started happening so often that we would carry the phone with us and ask it questions and it would answer back with either one word or short senescence. So about the time when we realized it would answer us my older brother(lets call him ""Bob"") dropped by cuz he was bored and wanted to chill. We quickly told him what was happening and told him to ask it a question, he gave us a little skeptical grin and asked ""are you a bitch?"" and right then and there the phone gets a message ""not funny Bob"" then he just threw it back at us and had a WTF face.  The creepy part was that the phone was talking to us three the whole day and right then and there it already knew my brothers name who had barely gotten there.  I start calling bullshit on the phone and start going through the settings and just messing with it and I get a message ""put me down FuhQhardcore"" i just drop the phone and say fuck that shit. The next day We're at my other friends house and we just have the phone there, now to let you guys know, i hate mayo like really really hate it(i had a nasty experience when i was in the 3rd grade) so we start asking each other and wondering who was txting us and we get a txt ""if you want to know who i am eat a sandwich with a lot of mayo"" right away i knew the message was for me. Everyone started laughing and trying to make me eat one but i just couldn't.  then after we calmed down i get a txt "" 'Kim' is calling you FuhQHardcore"" and right then my cell phone starts ringing and its her I was like wtf, I answer and and she just wanted to know what I was up to and if I was gonna go over later. (she was my girlfriend at the time) It would also ask and tell my friends stuff, but I mostly remember the parts that involved me. So yea, this goes on for about a month until the phone stopped charging and died out. 

Sorry if this is a little long and for grammar or whatever.  I know it sounds like bullshit, but it really happened. I don't know how or why just thought id share.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_zy79w,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/zy79w/haunted_cell_phone/,

There is a  cliff wall on our left hand side and a cliff edge to the right of us. The road is winding and fairly thin, so vehicles need to slow down to a crawl when passing on each other.

I've noticed a yellow camper-van approaching us. My girlfriend casually mentions ""watch out..."". We are both watching the van as we slowly approach one another. We are about 20 meters away from it when the curve in the road (and the cliff face) obscures the van from view. When we pass the corner... the van is gone!

Both my girlfriend look at each other shocked and we are both freaked out! I took a pen from the hire car's glove compartment and, without speaking, write ""yellow camper-van"" on one of my maps... I then ask my girlfriend to describe what she saw. She describes it as a ""yellow camper-van that vanished"".

There was nowhere for the van to go. I couldn't have gone off the cliff because of the trees and we would have seen it anyway. It couldn't have turned around and sped off because it was only out of view for two seconds...

I would have discounted this as a hallucination or imagination or false memory... but we witnessed the same thing!

I'm certain it wasn't a false memory because I took the precaution of noting what I saw for that reason. I did this mainly because I am someone who has never experienced anything strange and I felt compelled to attempt to verify it.

I just wanted to share this. I feel confident that we witnessed something very unusual and unexplainable.

My name is Brent. I am a college student but I love to go ghost hunting during my free time which means I'm into paranormal things. This is a back story to the events to come. Everything that happens in this story is true and nothing is made up.


(October 9, 2011)
	I went over to Joe's (one of my friends) dorm to hang out after classes were done. I knocked at the door and his other roommate answers the door and lets me in. ""He's in his room."" he says as I nod my head. I head into Joe's room and he is sitting at his computer, playing a game. He hears me and turns his head over to where I'm standing. ""Hey Brent."" he says. ""Hey."" I respond, ""what are you up to?"" He goes back to playing his game. I'm sitting there watching him and eventually I get bored and start to look around in his room. Nothing really catches my eye. Just some cans laying around, dirty dishes, you know, typical college dorm room. But then I notice a box in his closet, near the back. I reach back and find, much to my surprise, a ouija board. Now, I get all excited because I'm into the paranormal and I proceed to take it out of the box. He looks back and see's me taking it out of the box and he pauses his game. ""Yeah, i've always had that thing but I have never used it."" I look at him and say ""We should use it."" It takes about five minutes to convince him to finally use it. We go out to the living room and set it on the table. Long story short, we talked to two spirits. The first one's name was Resty and he was a 5 year old boy. The second's name was Garlie and he was a 48 year old man. We where talking to Garlie for a good ten minutes but then all of the sudden, the planchette went to ""goodbye."" We looked at each other with concerned looks on our faces, and proceeded to ask if Garlie was still there. No response. We both sat back and let the ouija board sit for 5 minutes while we took a break. ""Something probably scared it off"", Joe said. We laughed at this remark. ""There's only one thing that I can think of that could scare off a ghost"" I said. We were quite for a second and then decided to see if there was anything else there one last time. We asked ""Is anyone there?"" ""Yes"", was the response. ""Are you Garlie or Resty"", we asked. ""No"", it said. We were excited thinking we got another spirit. Without hesitation, we asked ""When were you born."" Our faces went from excitement to fear as it answered with ""I wasn't."" I figured it could be only one thing. A demon. We continued to push faith and ask it it's name. It answered with a long name that we didn't understand. We asked if it could spell it out again. It did, but we didn't get the name again. ""What's your name?"", we asked for the third time. The plachette went to ""no"". ""I think it's angry"", Joe said. I nodded. But still, we pushed our luck even farther. ""Do you have a nick-name?"" I asked it. ""All should ---- him."", it spelled out. We didn't get the third word so we asked ""What was the third word."" The plachette moved the fastest I had ever seen it move that day and kept spelling F-E-A-R-F-E-A-R-F-E-A-R-F-E-A-R. At that moment we just put the ouija board in its case and back into Joe's closet and we swore never to use it again. 

That promise was broken today.

(December 5, 2011)
	This time, there was more than just Joe and I. Joe, Ray, Steve, John, Bob, and I were all here this time and they were all non-believers in the ouija board. We were playing a card game when Joe and Ray noticed something black and fuzzy run past the hallway into the closet in the hallway. ""Holy shit!"", yelled Joe. ""What was that thing?"", Ray said. They told us that they saw something black and fuzzy running in the hall. Jokingly, I said ""We should ask the spirits what it was."" Joe looked at me dead serious and got up and went to his room. He had full intent on using the ouija board to find out what this thing was. Steve said, ""It's just a mouse guys, nothing to be afraid of."" Joe and Ray insisted that it was to big to be a mouse but to small to be a rat. Sure enough, here I am with Joe using this God-forsaken thing again. We ask if there are any spirits in the house. ""Yes"" it says. We ask it it's name. ""Fyn"" it spells out. Now knowing her name, we ask it what the fuzzy thing we saw was. She replied with ""It's her."" We were in shock when it said this, keep in mind it's 4 o' clock a.m. We asked what it's name was. At this point, it spelt out ""Shuvbiraz"". This was just a normal name to everyone except Joe and I. This name was the name we had been trying to figure out for a month or so. This was the being we talked to when we put the ouija board away last time. As if this wasnt freaky enough, we asked it what it is. It's reply was ""You know"". We said tell us. ""The Harvest."" Confused, we asked ""What are you harvesting?"" ""The two."" Now, Bob and I are brothers. In fact, we are identical twin brothers. Immediatly, we looked at each other thinking it was coming for us. Needless to say, bricks were shat. However, we asked it if it meant Bob and I as ""the two."" It didn't. It said, ""the two who summoned me."" That's when I knew it was talking about Joe and I. We where speechless. We sat there in shock and couldn't believe this was actually happening. ""Why do you want us"", Joe and I asked. ""I'm not free."" We figured it meant that summoning it came at a cost. We ended up finding out that our friend Steve was the only thing keeping it from attacking us because of his, what it called it, ""divine connection"". We also found that it is supposedly the mouse rat thing and that it's harvest is going to be swift. We said goodbye to it and put the board away.


Nothing has happend since Steve left and I hope nothing does happen. I should go to bed, but I am to scared to do so. I will end up pulling an all-nighter more than likely with all the lights on. What do you think of this? Have you ran into ""Shuvbiraz?"" Have you ever heard of the Harvest? Any thoughts on what we should do? Mostly everyone thinks that Steve is some sort of ""spirit nullification wall"". Is that possible? Is there a demon that takes a form of a mouse/rat? Let me know. I have a ghost hunting expedition this upcoming Friday and I will post if something happens. Thanks. 


EDIT: Another thing I forgot to mention was that it said something in what I believe to be binary. 0001001110110

EDIT: I tried converting the binary to letters but nothing came up. I managed to convert binary to decimal and came up with the number 630. Is there any significance with the number 630? A date? A time? If you find something out about either 630 or the binary, post below.

It started when my dad passed away a year and a half ago. He was a heavy drinker. My mum left him because of his addiction when i was 9 (i am now 22), he had a bad diet, and smoked heavily too. He went into ICU with pneumonia, because his body was in such a bad state he was soon on life support as his organs started to shut down. After 3 weeks my sister and i were asked the dreaded question from his doctors, to switch of life support. that night my sister, our half brother and our aunty spent his last 9 hours at the hospital playing music and talking about all our good memories while we waited for him to take his last breath. Once i heard the breathing stop i took my last look at him and ran out of the ward and to the elevator, i just felt like i had to get out of there. once i got to the elevator my mum called me and as soon as i picked up I could hear her crying and she said ""he is gone isn't he?"" I replied ""just a minute ago."" I thought her call was just a coincidence until she said to me ""I know, he woke me up and told me to call you now"". I had never really thought much about that call until recently. About 4 months after my dads death I found out I was pregnant, my partner and I were having trouble in our relationship at the time and split up during the pregnancy. I was extremely stressed with work, grief, family feuds and becoming a single mother. One night I was home with just my dog and I started to bawl my eyes out (raging hormones), when my dog came and scratched on the door.. This was really unusual for her to do, I took her to the back door thinking she needed to go outside, but she kept jumping at my feet and running to the kitchen table all excited about something. I had kept my dads dining table which he had kept from his and my mums divorce, as kids he always sat at the head of the table. My dog was jumping up at the chair at the head of the table, like she was playing with somebody there. After about a minute she went back and layed in her bed while she kept staring at the table and wagging her tail. Soon after, Elvis's - love me tender played in my head, i hadn't heard that song in years, dad always use to sing it to me as a kid, and I felt really at ease and happy again as soon as I heard it in my head, it was very odd. 
Anyway, 12 months down the track my partner and I are together and have a beautiful 6 month old son, we are living in an old Victorian style house and this place has started to creep me out, I have had electrical's plug themselves in and turn on, footsteps a few times, invisible items thrown at me (I heard things smash behind my head but nothing was thrown), things disappearing and reappearing. My partner is a big skeptic and thought I was going crazy for a while until he started to notice things too, like my phone disappeared from right in front of the both of us, after half an hour of searching It was sitting on top of the fridge which I can hardly reach. These things I can deal with but the one thing that really freaks me out is the banging that comes from my son's room every single night between 2am-4am. At first I thought it was my son maybe hitting the side of his cot or something, but I thought it was strange that it didn't wake him, over time the banging has gotten louder and I don't think there is any possible way he could make that amount of noise laying in his cot. There is no pattern to it, it's almost like somebody is rummaging through his room, my partner and I listen and when it becomes louder one of us goes to check but every time he is sound asleep. He quite often lays in bed and goo's and gah's and a couple of times I swear I have heard a mans voice reply to him. At first I thought it was my dads spirit checking up on his grandson that he never got to meet but sometimes I feel threatened which makes me think he is probably not connected?
I am a bit confused by it all and would love to hear your thoughts!

No matter how many years have passed, it always freaks me out when I think about it.

When I was a kid I used to go shopping with my mom. We would go to the mall and spend a lot of time in Macy's. Before it was Macy's, it was Kaufmann's. And it was another store before that. In the very back of the store, there's this old, run-down bathroom. Not many people go back there, simply because it's a long walk and the mall bathrooms are closer. The room is divided into two parts: There's a normal bathroom, and then a ""sitting room"" on the other side with chairs and a mirror. You walk through the sitting room to get to the toilets.

I was alone, my mom must have been looking at clothes or something. There was no one else in the bathroom. I was probably 10 or 12. I walked in the bathroom, through the sitting room, and went into a stall. I did my business and came out ... I was horrified. 
There was a woman in the sitting room in one of the chairs. I remember her head drooped to the side, and she had a blank expression on her face. She seemed slightly disfigured in a way I can't explain. There was just something off about her face. I hadn't heard her come in the bathroom, it was like she simply appeared. She was holding a baby who had the same weird face.
She stared at me as I walked out and washed my hands. I remember this was the first time in my life I felt real fear. I don't remember how it felt anymore, but I was horrified. I felt her staring at me and I had the strongest urge to flee, to run as far away from there as I could.

There was something disfigured about her face, and her eyes literally felt like they were burning into me. No one ever looked at me like that before. I was stricken by terror but there was no other exit from the bathroom, I had to walk by her to leave. So I guess I figured I'd get it over with. And as I got closer, I realized precisely what was so awful about her...
Her eyes were pure white with no pupils. They weren't glassy like a blind person's, they were simply a void of white. And the baby's were too.

I walked by her without looking back. I may have even ran out of the bathroom, I can't remember. At the time I thought she might have been an alien because of the weird shape of her head, but to this day I have no idea what was going on or why she was in the bathroom.

I'll do another set of 3 stories. I have a lot, but 3 is not too long and not too short. 
 
  So, this story is my sisters. I have 2 sisters both older than I. One is now 40 and the other is 27. My middle sisterwho was 4 at the time of this occurrence. We lived in a house at this point in time, my mother was home alone to watch me and my sister. My dad was at work and I believe my oldest sister was in highschool or moved out. I was 1 so I don't know much, except what happened to my middle sister that day. My mom was making lunch, while my sister was riding her tricycle around in our driveway. While my mom was in the kitchen she heard a loud thud against the house. My sister came in crying. She said she was walking to her tricycle when all the sudden it was lifted up in the air and thrown against the house. My mom went outside and checked on the bike and to see if it marked the house. My mom said the house had a black streak on it from the bike about 5 feet up the siding. That's not the last time something like that happened either. 

  Second story is also placed in this house, while I was still 1. I think we lived there for a few years, but that was before I was born. So we moved to Florida when I turned 2. Anyway, I had a Big Bird Weeble toy, it weighed about 3 pounds my mom said. She had it in my crib, which was in the living room, because it was next to the kitchen which is where my mom was... I don't know why my mom was in the kitchen all the time when I was a kid... but anyway, I was chillin in my crib... haha... and my mom heard a something slam into a picture. She looked over and my Big Bird Weeble toy was across the room and it had broken one of our framed pictures on the wall. It couldn't have been me. I was only 1 and I don't think I could of thrown something that far across the room and knock a picture down. It also weighed too much for a baby to do that.  I know I'm missing a few stories from this house, if I remember them I will post again. Anyway I have one more and it is about my Aunt.
 
 This happened when my mom and aunts were little.  It will be short. One night my aunt had to go to the bathroom real late. As she approached the door she saw light shine underneath the crack, so she knocked and no one answered. She opened it up and she saw, 4 little men dressed in dirty green attire, with black and red hair and their skin was kind of wrinkly, she said they were no taller than half a foot and were trying to pry the floor boards up in the bathroom. One of them saw her and looked at her and tolder her to get out! So she ran up to my grandparents bedroom and told them that there were little men in the bathroom tearing up the flooring. My grandfather got up and looked with her in the bathroom and they were gone. She never saw them, I don't think she ever tried to catch them anyway afterwards. But the funny thing is my grandfather even said that after that night happened his neighbor was asking him why the light was on in their bathroom at night. He was kind of shocked to hear that. He turned all the lights out at night before he went to bed. 

TL;DR
My sisters tricycle was thrown against our house and was broken. My toy in my crib was thrown against the wall across my living room and broke a picture. My aunt saw little men in my grandparents bathroom when she was little.

I have been in an insane amount accidents, put in a wheel chair for over a year, and been brutally attacked.

My mother says she has felt something ""dark"" every time one of these ""accidents"" has happened to me so much so that even from across the country, she calls my partner to confirm that something has indeed happened. 
 Her mother was also very superstitious and believed in omens, black crows were the one she was most terrified of. She saw them outside the kitchen window while washing dishes and for reasons she can't explain, walked down to the basement and found my uncle hanging from the beams.

 A few other random things: My stepdad dreams things that happen before they happen. The first time he dreamed he was on a houseboat and found a body of a man with blood coming out of his ears, dead and foul play seemed apparent. 2 days later they found his cousin in his house boat dead, the cops ruled it suicide but the family suspects otherwise. The second time wasn't as creepy but he dreamed he was in the emergency room and his knee was bleeding. He woke to a crashing sound (someone had driven there car into our front yard totaling my dads truck that was parked on the street.) as he ran to the living room, he hit his knee on the chipped corner of our glass coffee table.

1366345678.0,34,self.Paranormal,1cnrp2,Worst apartment of my life.,phoenix_II,45,11,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1cnrp2/worst_apartment_of_my_life/,"I'm bored tonight, so I figured I'd share some of my experiences with a terrible living situation I had in college. It was my first apartment, which was exciting until it wasn't.
       
**Wall of text. Long story long:**
         
My best friend from college (who we'll call Martha) and I did a study abroad together in the UK. We made plans to move into an apartment with Martha's dorm roommate and and that roommate's boyfriend when we got back. Let's call these roommates Inconsiderate Susie and Too-Loud-In-the-Morning-and-Uses-All-the-Toilet-Paper Larry. Susie and Larry never experienced anything in the apartment, which may be due to a stupid mistake that Martha and I made which they did not... (I'll get to that.)
         
In the weeks before Martha and I move in (Susie and Larry have been living there already for about 2 weeks), Martha goes down to paint her bedroom before she moves her furniture in. Having no furniture and not wanting to die from paint fumes, she sleeps in the living room in her sleeping bag. She had a dream in which she woke up and saw Susie walk out of her bedroom. Susie stopped, looked at her with dead eyes and in a flat voice said, ""It's time to get up now."" And then Martha woke up. And then Susie came out of her bedroom exactly as in the dream and said, ""Oh, you're up! I was going to wake you up. It's 7."" So, it's a weird thing but we don't think much about it.
       
So, we move into the apartment. My bedroom door has a crucifix on it, which Martha and I agree is just a little weird. Not really sure what to do with it, so we just put on the first stair that leads to the attic and shut the door, and forget about it. We move in and things are going great. Until we make what was probably a stupid mistake.
         
Martha takes some photography classes and figures that there might be some stuff in the attic she can take pictures of. Well, she ends up finding a gold mine up there. Old magazines, newspapers, knick-knacks, personal papers, shoes, etc. Just a plethora of stuff from the '40s on up. Martha then takes me up there, and here is our stupid mistake: we take things. I take a wooden sign advertising a summer camp and a ceramic orange. Martha takes shoes. They are exactly her size and fit her perfectly. (Honestly, you'd think we'd never seen a horror movie before. So stupid.)
          
And spoiler alert: this is when it really starts. Martha and I are constantly being watched. We never feel alone and the air in the apartment is oppressively heavy. We are just extremely uncomfortable in the apartment. It's not so bad when other people are around, but when either of us was alone, it felt like you were descended upon by a huge, angry... thing and the energy became very much ""You better get THE HELL out of here RIGHT NOW!"" There were times it was so oppressive that we would just leave and wait for someone else to get home before going back. Once Martha thought she forgot her wallet, so went back for it. As she was searching, she could feel the energy changed and honestly felt like something was chasing her out, so she ran away without her wallet.
         
I was always tired in this apartment. Always. I was constantly in bed because I was exhausted. Now, I love taking naps. Love it. But this wasn't the same. It was a struggle to get up and go to class. I went and had blood work done because after months of that I thought there was something seriously wrong with me, but it came back normal. I was medically perfectly healthy, but I barely got out of bed.
           
A couple months in, I started to realize there was a woman in my closet. I couldn't see her, but I could feel that she was there. (I've been sensitive in that way since I was a kid, but I always try to keep myself closed off.) She didn't do anything, just sort of hung out and seemed to constantly be looking at me. If the apartment was empty, Martha and I were not comfortable sleeping in our bedrooms and would sleep on the couch. One weekend everyone was gone, so I couched it. We didn't have cable, so I put in Larry's Simpsons DVDs so I could fall asleep. For three days straight, I woke up with the DVD on top of the player. The first time it happened, I assumed that for some reason I had sleepwalked to the player and took the DVD out, though I couldn't think of any reason I would do that. It was harder to tell myself that when it happened the other two times. Because... why?
          
When everyone came back, I went back to sleeping in my own bed. I should note here that my bedroom was next to a sunporch, and one of the windows in my bedroom opened up into the sunporch. (We were on the second floor so this didn't bother me.) One night, I woke up in the middle of the night and through the gap in my blinds could see a black shadow in the window, like it was staring at me. And because of how close my bed was to the wall/window, this shadow was basically right in my face. I freaked out, rolled out of bed like a ninja and turned on the light, thinking that someone had gotten onto the sunporch. (The sunporch had a door that did not lock and the door was across from our front door, so the only way to access the sunporch from actually inside the apartment was through that window in my bedroom.) So, I thought I was about to be murdered by a person. Except when I turned on my bedroom light, the shadow was gone and there was no one out there. And being on the second floor, I would have heard someone if they had run off down the stairs to leave. After recovering from my heart attack, I somehow managed to go back to sleep (and the next day demanded that the landlord put a lock on the door to that sunporch).
         
I got the crucifix back from the attic steps and put it back on my door, thinking that someone obviously had it there for a reason. But things were getting worse, not better. Martha and I continued to be smothered by very unpleasant energy. I got touched once. In the shower. Because why not touch someone when they're the most vulnerable, right? Ugh. I was in the shower before class and felt something touch me on my side just above my hip. It was pretty cold, a lot colder than the water and it was focused on one spot instead of my entire body like would happen if the shower curtain had opened a bit and air had gotten in. It also felt like a hand. I finished my shower and kept telling myself it was just air because I didn't need anything else to happen.
           
It was shortly after this that I had my worst experience ever. Not just in this apartment, but ever. It sounds like a mild experience, but the implications of it are what scare me the most. Anyway. I was home alone one night in my bedroom, typing out a paper. My bedroom opened up to the kitchen and was right next to the front door. I was just typing away when I heard Martha in the kitchen. In the typical sing-songy voice she used to greet me, she said, ""It's meeeeeeee."" And I stopped for a moment. Thought it through. I froze. I knew she wasn't home. I picked up my phone and texted her, ""Where are you?"" She replied pretty quickly, ""At the library."" I asked her to come home ASAP. So, I'm sitting there, with absolutely NO intention of going out into the kitchen. And then the energy starts to get all horrible again. But so much worse than usual. It's so bad that I can feel that there's something the kitchen that is absolutely FURIOUS that I'm not coming out of my room. It was so intense that it honest to God felt like an actual, human serial killer was pacing back and forth in front of my bedroom door. I was so terrified I couldn't move. I was cowering on my bed. I put on my headphones and tried to ignore it, but I was literally shaking with fear that it was going to come in my room. (But I also felt like it *couldn't* come in my room. Like it wasn't allowed to. I don't know if it had something to do with that crucifix or the woman in the closet or what, but I knew it needed me to go out to it. Which... fat chance. No way.)
          
After a bit, Martha comes home and the air instantly clears. I feel fine. I explain to her what happened and said, ""It's gone."" She leaned against my wall and just had an awful look on her face and said, ""No it's not. It's right here."" She was feeling the usual suffocating energy, but 10x worse than normal and I wasn't feeling it at all anymore. Like it turned its attention to her.
           
So we decided to put all the stuff from the attic back because we couldn't think of what else to do. We had our religious friend come over for that. As a joke, I sent our friend into my bedroom with the light off and closed the door on her. Five seconds later, she was like, ""Open the door! Open the door, please!"" So we opened the door and I wanted to know what that was about, but she said it was nothing. Suuurrrreeee.
             
A little bit later we put the stuff back where we found it, said we were sorry and our friend said a prayer. (Before this she said, ""There's a woman in the corner watching us."" And I had never told her about that, so I was just like *fantastic*.) After that, we went back downstairs and thought, oh, good, it's over.
         
Well. NOPE. As we were standing around discussing our dinner options, the suffocating energy was back and it was horrible. It was almost like you could feel it reach into you. Very, very unpleasant. I turned to Martha and said, ""It's behind us, right?"" She just nodded. And then she felt something brush past her/physically touch her arm, so we just left. We went to get dinner.
         
The energy was slightly better after we put all the stuff back in the attic, but it wasn't a real improvement. Martha and I just tried to not be alone there and were out of the apartment as much as possible. We just rode it out until the lease was up and we moved out. We were having interpersonal conflicts with Susie and Larry anyway, so on every level we were just happy to be out of there.
          
I've lived in houses with activity before, but nothing, *nothing* like that.

But i'm still hoping some of you will read it. It's a crazy story. I don't know if I can call it coincidence or not, but it's interesting nonetheless.

Here we go!
When I was ~12, I was using a Ouija board with my cousin. It belonged to my friend's great grandmother. I had used it often before but for some reason this time it wasn't working as it usually did. 

I'm not really someone who's going to get scared by these things, nor am I a devout believer of them. But this time... it was different. Every time I contacted a spirit, instead of saying anything, as soon as we touched the pointer it would fly back and forth, spelling 'ZNZ' over and over again. We tried asking questions about it but they would just leave if we did. It happened about 6-7 times with different spirits.

Finally, we tried calling our grandfather who had passed away recently. And I couldn't get properly a hold of him, but he kept on giving out random numbers and dates. I wrote them all down on a piece of construction paper I had. The last thing he said was 'Zachery'. My cousin was uncomfortable with continuing using it after this. I still to this day have that piece of paper. A lot of the things said didn't seem to make sense. And the date wasn't something that was going to take place for what seemed like a long while. 

A few months later I was Ouija-ing again with some friends, and this time I was given more details to the situation. They said that this ZNZ would be the cause of my death. My friends were a little bit panicky but I didn't stress about it. 
They told me the situation. He was a pilot. When I got home, I brought out that piece of paper from where it was shoved in some notebook, and it started to make more sense. There was a latitude and longitude on it, as well as the number of people who he was going to kill. That was supposedly my 'fate'. I didn't think anything of it. The latitude and longitude said I would be somewhere around Florida. I have never been there nor would I ever have reason to go. I dismissed it. 

Well, when I was 17 my mother told me that we were going back to visit the island that I grew up on- in the Caribbean. I was excited, it was great news.

I didn't think of that piece of paper. 

I had a great time down there, visiting old friends and such. 

Our connection flight on the way back was in Miami. I was sitting in the airport and it suddenly came back to me. Because I always remembered what that paper had said. And I was sitting at the Miami International Airport on the same day that paper told me almost 5 years previously. 

I remember my heart rate spiking up, and getting butterflies, but I calmed down. I wasn't scared. I boarded that plane.

We were all sitting in our seats, waiting, because the flight was being delayed. When suddenly the captain's voice came on the loudspeaker, like always, and tells us about the approximate landing time, weather, etc- and introduced himself as Zachery Zeji (sp?). Z (N?) Z. 

I was shocked at that. But what was I going to do? Tell my mom and brother we had to get off the plane? I didn't really believe this was a premonition that could exist. I didn't say anything. Still, the plane did not take off.
Then, suddenly, we were told we had to change planes because during the last check, they found a fault in the engine. 

Normally they would just check the records to see if it had been reported and looked at previously, if it's a dent or something and the flights wouldn't change. But no; we all had to get off the plane and get reassigned to different flights because they didn't believe the problem could be fixed quickly enough for everyone to make their connections.

Call it coincidence, call it creepy, call it fake or whatever you want to. 
I just find it to be an interesting story I went through to share with paranormal junkies like myself :)

TL;DR: A Ouija board predicted a situation that ended up happening to me.

Edit: Pursenboots (lol, love the name) asked for pics.

Had to go through a big bin of papers (I used to aspire to be a writer and saved everything)

Turned out it wasn't even in there. Just mainly Pon and Zi doodles like this:
http://i.imgur.com/3fdRnLP.jpg (Please forgive the lack of rotation)
And eventually... I found the paper! It wasn't construction paper, sorry, but sketching paper.
http://i.imgur.com/rHNG3nA.jpg
Explanations:
For some reason I had written my old address on it, so that's that blotted out part.
#1) My name, next to my Cousin's. 
#2) The date I wrote all this down
#3) I was flying back to California, also doodles.
#4) The first time I wrote it down.
#5) 'He will kill 401' after further 'investigating' we found out they meant 401 people were going to die. Seeing as it was a large plane, this number I assume is correct.
#6) First time we saw his name, after my grandfather had spelled it out.
#7) The date, a little bit out of order.
#8) HIJ stands for Henry Irving Jacob, a famous ghost who always gave his initials out. That's why I knew ZNZ were initials from the beginning. 
#9) I don't know what this is, but as I was putting the red 9 next to it I realized it might be a gate terminal at the airport.
#10) The latitude and longitude. Didn't realize what that was until after watching Lost, lol.

And as annoying as it was to do all that searching, kind of cool... look what I found!

My boarding pass! From the same day. However, that was my first flight, to Miami, not departing from it. I couldn't find the other one but nonetheless it proves I was in that airport on the date written down.

My friends suggested I post this on /r/Paranormal  since it has kind of become a campfire tale of mine. It is a short read, sorry that I don't really have any answers.

So this was about 13 years ago, when I was about 6 or 7. There is really no date, don't think it matters much though. All I know is that this story was from before my parents got a divorce.

Let me explain the layout of the rooms in the story that matter real quick. My room as at the top left corner and my bed is against the right wall. The room is connected to the hallway by the door near the end of the bed. Right across from my room is the kitchen, and in the kitchen my dad was making some popcorn before he and my mom popped in some movies. If this adds any depth or theories to the story, the house was actually where the fire fighters used to live. It is directly across the street from the fire department.

""Nothing was really off about the night, we hadn't even watched any horror movies,"" he had told me.

He threw in the homestyle popcorn my mom really loved and was sitting there. 

""I heard something from your room, I think it was just a noise from the attic,"" he says.

My dad went to check it out and he says he saw something that totally freaked him out.

""I wasn't on drugs, I swear, that was when I was when I was already clean a few years.""

What he saw at the end of my bed was a little girl in a black gown, sitting in a playful position, staring at me with her arms crossed. She turned around, looked at him and then went back to staring at me.

""Holy shit, Ryan, I ran and got your mom. When we both went back she was gone, we didn't let you sleep in there. We brought you into the living room and you fell asleep with us later that night, well I didn't sleep much.""

So that is what most people think is the end of the story, though it continues into the next few days.

It rained pretty hard that day, exceptionally hard. Though it wasn't anything strange, we were living in a coastal town, sometimes the ocean threw nasty little storms at you.

Well that night, they didn't let me sleep in there again. Everyone went to sleep relatively early. When we woke up there was an odd smell. My dad got up and walked to the bathroom, figuring someone didn't flush. On the way there he looked in my room...

He was always a very earth and nature centered person, taking great interest in the paranormal, science, natural medicine, and, most passionately, native american lore and lifestyle. Despite that half of our family being strongly southern Baptist, he was not a strongly religious when it came to those views. He was also an avid bird watcher, taking particular interest in hawks and birds of prey. The day after his passing, my uncle was woken up in the morning by a shrill crying. He went out onto his back porch and there was a hawk sitting in a tree along his property line. Associating hawks with his father, he took it as a ""personal sign"" that his father was still with them in their hearts, all of that emotionally comforting stuff. The next day, my father (who is currently staying with my grandmother) stepped outside to smoke and found a hawk sitting in the tree next to my grandfather's garden. It sat there the entire time my dad was outside, just watching him. By this point, we all began to get a strange but peaceful feeling, taking the hawk sightings to be his way of letting us know ""he was okay."" Christmas day, my other uncle was sitting outside and, sure enough, both a hawk and an eagle flew directly over head twice before flying away. New years day, we all gathered at my grandmother's house since Christmas day, the usual day we all get together, we were all still reeling from our loss. We were all talking about the hawk sightings and how odd it was that it kept occurring. My uncle stepped out for a smoke, but poked his head back in after a few seconds. He called us onto the porch, and sitting in the tree directly next to the porch, there was a hawk sitting at the top. And now, over the past five days, my grandmother has seen seven hawks at various places, all of them not being the least bit shy. Normally, we never see hawks around here. I have never seen this many in this short amount of time. After doing a little research via some books on native american culture, I found out that a hawk is considered to be a messenger from the spirit world, as well as a symbol of a great and wise leader. Maybe this is all a sign from him, communication after death. Maybe we are reading into it too much. Either way, it has been a strange series of events. Does anyone has any more information/thoughts/opinions? I'd love to hear them.

So here we go. For ten years of my child hood, I lived in a very small town in northern Oklahoma, almost in the panhandle. We had bought a very large Victorian style house for a ridiculously good price. It was in good condition, it was just cheap because no one in their right mind would move to this little town in the ass crack of nowhere. I believe that once upon a time it was a plantation house. It had three stories plus an underground level  that was pretty creepy in my recollection. And you knew this place was legit when you saw the heavy wooden doors with crystal door knobs, and old laundry chutes with the elevator thingy that went straight down to the basement like you see in old hotels. Anyway, there were plenty of happenings experienced in this house by my family that didn't add up. I was home alone one day while both my parents were at work, playing Nintendo 64 in my room with the door open when, without warning, the heavy solid oak door slammed shut and opened again. It did this three times in succession. I jumped up, and ran into the hallway expecting to find one of my brothers, who loved playing pranks on me. But they were all at friends houses. I quickly pushed it out of my head and went back to crash bandicoot. Another situation that always really stood out from the others happened when I was home alone, again. My mother had always told me not to climb into the laundry chute because it had a 20 something foot dead fall to the concrete laundry room floor in the basement. But the platform had always been jammed at the top floor so when she was gone, I'd sneak in and read books in the small space inside. One day I did this alone (again with the house empty) and about ten minutes into reading the square door to the chute shut and latched on me from the outside. I was so terrified, I just sat there and balled. I would have kicked the wooden door open but I was afraid of bouncing and dislodging the platform and falling 20 feet in the fetal position onto concrete. So I slept in there for a handful of hours until my mom got home from work and heard me yelling. I got in a load of trouble. But I never fucked with that chute again. That's for sure. 

TL:DR, The ghosts in my old house were dicks.

As a small child he was my best friend, and protector. One sad day, he died suddenly without any warning. I was in the bath tub at the time. My mom came to get me, and took me to see him. I remember there being a certain unearthly quietness about my life during the year following the tragic event; though as a five year old I hadn't yet been told about death, there was a strong understanding I held close, and it comforted me. I told myself that death was the most permanate thing, and I accepted that. 

Little did I know the things that would happen in the next ten years of my life would change what I believed forever. 

At first the haunting started out as small things, like pawsteps and jingling collars sometimes following me around, and on rare occasion even seeing a big fluffy yellow Labrador watching me out of the corner of my eye as I did my daily chores. At first I was a little bit freaked out and scared, but as time went on I began to accept it as a normal and welcomed part of my life. 

A few years later, when I was about ten, we got a huge snowfall during the winter. It was four feet deep, the most we've gotten in decades. I had just gotten into bed when I remembered something I had left in the car. I went down stairs, took the keys and headed out into the cold, closing the door tightly behind me. Once I had retrieved my belongings from the car, I headed back to the house, only to discover that the door had locked behind me. I frantically went around the house checking all doors and windows for possible entry ways. There were none. I tried banging on the door, but no one responded. 

I soon gave up and sat down on the frozen ground where there was no snow. I shivered. I was wearing a tanktop and some flanel pajama bottoms; no clothes for temperatures below freezing. Just as I couldn't stand the cold anymore, warm fur brushed up against my side. I looked over to see a dog I recognized as Bear. It was impossible, I told myself.  It appeared to be true though. 

Bear laid down next to me, and I curled into his warm, fluffy tummy. I fell asleep after a while, and awoke to being hurriedly carried into the house by my parents. They asked me if I was ok; I told them yes. 

It was later discovered that I had no health issues from my night outdoors, which was a miracle. I still had one question.

""Are there any golden retrievers in the neighborhood?"" I asked my parents. They told me that no, there weren't any. 

On that day I was convinced of one fact. Bear was still with me, watching me grow up through every part of my life, and would always be my guardian angel.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_z4md1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/z4md1/bear/,

If anyone has had anything similar happen, I'd love to hear about it. 

This experience is what got me so interested in the paranormal world and I just have to share it with everyone, hopefully someone has had something similar happen so we can compare.

When I was 16, I went to my friends house during the summer. It was great because his parents were both at work and we had the whole house to ourselves to do whatever we wanted. So we call my other friend over and she comes with a Ouija board. (I now know I should have never played around with it. THEY ARE NOT A TOY.) Myself being a skeptic with the whole ouija concept at the time, decided hey, let's mess around with it. So the three of us headed down to the basement and began asking it questions. I wanted to be a turd and scare them so I started moving the pointer around saying ""yes"" and ""no"" and what not, until my friend caught on and they said ""Let's all just hover our fingers over the pointer!"" I agreed, and thought nothing would happen and this was a waste of time.

When the pointer started moving again, I thought something was fishy still. My one friend asked all the questions. ""What's your name?"" ""Baba Yaga"" it spelled out, which to me meant gibberish. ""Can you give us a sign?"" ""Yes"" ""Now?"" ""Yes"" So we sat there in silence and nothing happened. Not even a flicker of a light or anything. We were all disappointed so we pushed the board aside started talking about how this was all a hunk of crap.

My one friend decides to go upstairs and grab us some ice cream bars from the freezer. The two of us just chilling in the basement where startled when the friend BOLTED back down the stairs, tears streaming down her face.

""The kitchen.."" she whispered as she huddled behind me.
I felt my knees tremble, because I had never seen her scared before, and I know something must have happened. So slowly the three of us hiked up the stairs and I peered around the corner into the kitchen.
Every single cupboard in the entire kitchen (there was a lot of cupboards) was wide open and EVERYTHING that was in the cupboards was piled into a pyramid type shape in the centre of the room. I felt sick because I couldn't explain how it happened.

I knew neither of my friends had done it because you go through the kitchen to get to the basement and everything was normal beforehand, and when my friend went up to grab the ice cream bars she was literally gone for seconds.

Being scared and worried, I told my friend to leave his home and to come hangout at my house until we figured out what to do next.
That night, his parents called mine to say we couldn't hang out anymore, and for him to come home not only because the kitchen was a mess, but ALL THE wallpaper in the ENTIRE house had been ripped down and thrown in the centre of his parents bed.
All three of us stopped being friends after that. I hadn't heard from either of them until my one friend called after seeing a scene in the second paranormal activity where the cupboards explode open I guess. She wanted to confirm that what happened with us was real. And I told her it had indeed happened.
It also took a few years for find out that Baba Yaga is known as a trickster witch in russian folklore.
To this day I still don't understand what else could have caused this all besides spirits of some sort. And because of this experience and MANY more after that occurrence, I've really dipped into the Spiritualist way.

Also I want to note that I've had paranormal events/experiences my whole life, I learned the tarot when I was 10 and still do it now, but it's as if since this experience, it's amplified, in good ways and bad.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_v5rbn,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/v5rbn/the_cupboards_one_of_my_true_experiences_xpost/,

One day around Halloween we decided to make our own haunted house in the guest room and invite the younger girls from across the street in hopes of getting a scare out of them. We went all out...dressed up like ghosts, hung dolls from the ceiling, and recorded scary noises on her barbie karaoke machine. We had a whole skit planned out where I was to be the ghostly tour guide while she stayed under the bed making scary noises. About half way through the whole thing I started hearing this rather creepy noise of a young girl singing and thought my friend was doing an amazing job...I saw her slide from under the bed with a disturbing pale face and throw the karaoke machine on the bed. The noise was still going on and we all thought it was still part of the act. My friend began to get frantic, started crying, and ran out of the room. One of the girls ran after her to see if she was okay and I went to the machine to turn it off...only to realize it was already off. That's when it finally dawned on me.

Videos and photographs could always be tampered with in one form or another, but it used to take skill and equipment. These days, it's so simple that there are a plethora of online tutorials on ways to [fake a ghost picture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNKtybQO6TM) or [fake a ghost video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=skXos1JPngk). This, of course, would also apply to film or video footage of shadow people, UFOs, cryptids, and so on.

The other major form of evidence I've seen is from EVPs. Aside from studies showing that they're most likely [picking up radio waves](http://www.modernageparanormal.com/kb/the_science_of_evps.asp) along with [TV signals, CB radios, and baby monitors](http://www.skepdic.com/evp.html) (let's not forget how incredibly polluted our airwaves are), they're also creating a situation ripe for [auditory pareidolia](http://www.polysyllabic.com/?q=node/259), where the human brain's instinctual need to make patterns out of nonsense works to fill in the blanks. That doesn't mean the EVP phenomenon isn't real, but it's likely that the vast majority could be explained away as, well... normal.

Now let's say that someone actually captures a legitimate voice from beyond the grave or from the ether. For example, perhaps they'd say entire sentences, or you'd overhear them having full conversations, as opposed to the fragments usually intercepted. And perhaps, in the content of these recordings, they'd say things that support the supposition that they have retained their consciousness after their brains and hearts and bodies have died. Unless you're the one capturing the footage, how would you know that the audio wasn't just made up?

If you're approaching it from the position of skeptical inquiry, I don't know how videos, photos, and audio recordings could be accepted as evidence these days. And if you aren't approaching it from the position of skeptical inquiry, then... well, then you just believe because you've chosen to believe, which is fine, but then how could your descriptions of paranormal events that you've experienced be taken seriously by others?

So what are your thoughts? I'm not posting this in an attempt to debunk photography or video/audio recordings of paranormal phenomena. Rather, I'm wondering how everyone reconciles this.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,True,,,True,t3_tcyzi,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/tcyzi/considering_how_easy_it_is_to_fake/,
1335456039.0,35,self.Paranormal,stpoa,"Carl Sagan said ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."" - What are your thoughts on this?",ofthe5thkind,50,15,63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/stpoa/carl_sagan_said_extraordinary_claims_require/,"You can loosely trace this sentiment from the Enlightenment onward. In 1748, David Hume said the following in An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding: ""No testimony is sufficient to establish a miracle, unless the testimony be of such a kind that its falsehood would be more miraculous than the fact which it endeavors to establish...""

Pierre-Simon Laplace later said ""The weight of evidence for an extraordinary claim must be proportioned to its strangeness."" Marcello Truzzi stated that ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof."" Carl Sagan modified this, ever so slightly.

Extraordinary claims include spirit/demonic possession, the ability of mediums to use tools such as ouija boards, tarot cards, etc. to access the spirit world, that there is a spirit world at all, that we can communicate with biologically dead people, and so on. Virtually anything that falls under the ""paranormal"" umbrella would be considered an extraordinary claim.

However, the ""proof"" of the existence of paranormal phenomena, by its very nature of being extraordinary in its claims, is not extraordinary. I see many posts here stating, in matter-of-fact tones, the extraordinary abilities of crystals or water memory or incantation or ghosts. The replies, in general, are agreeable, with many contributing their own experiences to add to the plethora of accumulated data. Yet, all it ultimately amounts to is personal experience.

What I'm struggling with is the strong and sometimes passionate belief in paranormal phenomena that I observe in others, but without the extraordinary evidence required to prove that any of it is even remotely true. Yet the believers believe it, swear by it, insist upon it.

I guess what this post ultimately boils down to is this question, posed with the intent of courteousness: how do you reconcile your belief in something that has no proof outside of the fallible condition of personal experience? Is it because you wish it were all true? Is it because you have extraordinary evidence that has yet been shared?

1324750803.0,33,self.Paranormal,npbc1,Aunt's old house is haunted. Here's our stories.,Udub,37,4,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/npbc1/aunts_old_house_is_haunted_heres_our_stories/,"My Aunt lived in this house about 8 years ago. It was a house on Magnolia Bluff in Seattle. It had a fantastic view. The house was built in 1914 and had been renovated on the ground floor and the upstairs (not the basement – it was stuck in the 60’s). 

The first big thing that happened was about a year she and my uncle moved into the house. My aunt was sleeping upstairs because my uncle was snoring too loud in the master bed on the ground floor, and she couldn’t sleep so she was reading. She heard a loud bang, like a gun, and a man yell, “HELP!” She sat her book down and ran down the stairs only to encounter my uncle. My uncle had heard a bang and then a woman yell, “HELP!” They were completely freaked out but tried to blow it off, and then my Aunt felt something brush up against her leg while she was hugging my uncle. 

They both went back to bed, and my Aunt found her book closed on her bed when she went upstairs. She vividly remembered setting it down cracked open. She read for a little bit, and then just as she was turning out the light she heard footsteps. However, they weren’t footsteps going up the stairs – just from the landing (all hardwood). She didn’t see anyone out there from a shadow, and she hid under her covers. She felt the ghost touch her, before disappearing. My aunt says she stayed under the covers for an eternity before peaking out and going downstairs with my uncle despite his snoring. 
She would have similar instances with the footsteps, but nothing quite as extraordinary as that night, at least until my cousin was about one year old.

However, after this event they asked some of the older neighbors if they knew the people who owned the house years ago. They said that they did, and it was rather odd. They would have people come in the middle of the night (in the 40’s, 50’s) and they owned a Rolls Royce. They often heard loud arguments coming from the house as well. 

When my Aunt and Uncle remodeled the house, in the basement behind the drywall under the stairs was written a poem in red ink. The last line of the poem is the only one anyone remembers, and says, “And the rose lies beyond the wall.” My Aunt is just speculating, but her thoughts are that someone with a Rolls Royce who gets frequent visitors in similar cars and has a poem in the basement about a rose could very well be a member of the Seattle Mafia – leaving a rose on the body of the dead. Also, there were bullet holes in all of the walls in the basement (previous owners said it was target practice – still illegal in the Seattle city limits afaik). 

While remodeling, a plumber was in the basement while my uncle was at work and my aunt was getting her hair cut. All the windows in the house were closed, and he was 100% alone. He heard someone right behind him whisper, “what’s happening?” and he turned around only to see no one there. He ran out of the house and sat on the grass outside waiting for my uncle to come back home to go get his tools. His visit was free of charge.

When my aunt and uncle had my cousin, things started to get weirder. My cousin would wake up in the middle of the night screaming in the corner of his crib, and the second my aunt would walk into the room he’d stop and crawl over to her. His electronic toys would go off in the middle of the night all at once, even though they would all be in the off position. My aunt had to take all of the batteries out to stop them from going off. 

My only experience caused me to never go into the basement again. I always felt creeped out, like I was being watched even when I wasn't alone. Anyways, me, my mom, and my little 5 year old sister were babysitting my cousin while my aunt went shopping. We were in the basement where the Xbox was and I was playing. My mom and my sister went upstairs to check on my cousin. About 10 minutes later I heard some running around and voices which I assumed meant that my cousin was up. I turned off the Xbox and then as I turned to go up the stairs, I froze. The hair stood up on the back of my neck, and then out of the corner of my eye I saw a white figure go past the glass door that led to the laundry room. I went upstairs and my mom exclaimed that I looked like I saw a ghost. Not only that, my mom and sister were just reading a magazine the whole time since they went upstairs and hadn’t said a word or walked around or anything – my cousin was still asleep. 

I also forgot to mention the attic doors. Upstairs, there were two doors that led to the attic and they were latched. From time to time, they would slam open and continuously hit the walls over and over. My aunt would latch them, but they’d just do it again later. My uncle tied the doors shut so they’d quit coming undone. There was nothing we could do to mimic the unlatching – not stomping, kicking, blowing a fan at them from the attic or the inside, nothing. Also, the front door would fly open even when shut. It blew a hole in the drywall and had to be patched twice before my aunt and uncle just always padlocked the door. 

My aunt moved because of these events. I don’t know the people who live there anymore but I’d like to visit them and ask if they’ve experienced anything, as it’s changed hands 3 times since my aunt lived there 8 years ago. 

That’s my story – I’ll try and answer any questions as they arise.

My father didnt say anything about what i saw, just that i had seen some things. this guy who was 900 km away from where i had this experiance called back 2 days later and said that there was a man, a woman, an older lady and a kid and that they have moved on now. and that was what i had seen. 

A few years later i had a problem with my ankle that wouldnt go away. i had been to the doctor a few times, but nothing helped. so i went to visit him for healing. I havent had a problem with it since. same with my brother, he had a back injury that wouldnt go away and this guy healed him. 

sadly a few weeks ago he passed away from throat cancer. But 1 hour before he passed away when my parents where in to car driving to our cabin he talked to my mom in her head saying that he was going to die soon, but that it was okay and she shouldnt worry. they later found out he had passed away 1 hour after he talked to her. 
My dad also said that he could sense his pressence in his funeral, because he had a verry special kind of parfume he always used and my dad smelled it a few times as if he was walking by",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1jzbq5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1jzbq5/i_knew_a_guy_with_special_powers/,

I apologise if you may have already read this on /r/nosleep 


The last few days have been a bit odd, where children are concerned.


*Tuesday*


On Tuesday I was walking back from the store, a Pakistani boy around 7-8 years old was walking about 10 feet ahead, he kept turning around, I thought he was looking at me, but it seems he was looking past me, kind of up and over my shoulder.

I disregarded it the first few times, but then started to look behind me when he looked back to see what the fuss was about, but nothing was there, and no one was further behind me.

He frequently did this over the span of 1-2 minutes before doing a prayer(?) and sprinting off.

(He did 'The father, son and holy ghost' touching his forehead, chest and each shoulder.)


*Wednesday*

Wednesday I was walking back from a different store, there was a white girl sitting outside doing some sort of rhythm game, she must have been a little younger, maybe 6 or 7 years old, she was clapping her hands, then tapping the table with her palms, she turned to look at me as I was walking past, she covered he face with her hands and hunched herself over until I was gone.


*Thursday*

On Thursday a little black boy, younger again, I would say between 4-5, was standing outside my house while I was standing outside, his mother was on the phone just a few feet away.

He said something to me which I didn't quite hear, I said 'Hello' to him and he began talking in some foreign language pointing to my front door. He then went on to mimic the way I was standing and stood right next to me.

He then ran up to my front door and pushed it to see if it was open, still talking at me. He kept trying to get the attention of his mother while pointing at the door, when she ended her call she took his hand and began to cross the road, he kept pointing at the door saying 'I want to go, I want to go!' and began to cry as she dragged him away.

As they were leaving she said 'We'll come back later' in an attempt to shut him up.

*Today*

I live about 100 feet from a primary school and on my way back from work there was a child and his mother talking to another woman across the street from my house.

The child (Small white boy, toddler again) just stood staring across the street, I assume it was at the door or entrance in general before I arrived in front.

Again nothing strange about the door or the building as far as I know...

Although I don't believe in the paranormal it has left me a little spooked.

Is there something following me that these children are noticing?



*Yesterday Night*

(Probably unrelated, but may as well mention it)


Also, whether this was brought on by my thoughts of it all, or whether it is actually something with me I had a nightmare last night that my living room was haunted and that a drawer was moving of it's own accord, out of the chest of drawers, on the floor, then sliding across the room towards me / the bedroom door.
As if it was being pushed a few inches at a time.

Needless to say I woke up in the middle of the night absolutely scared stiff, eventually managing to get back to sleep.
It probably isn't relevant, but I found it odd I'd have a nightmare the night after talking to people about it all.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1in4za,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1in4za/children_acting_weird_around_me_for_a_few_days_x/,
1373473391.0,30,self.Paranormal,1i0kpa,The Friendly Cable Box Ghost,DBrickasaurus,51,21,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1i0kpa/the_friendly_cable_box_ghost/,"Short preface: I've always been highly skeptical of the paranormal. Although my skepticism has waned a bit as a result of this isolated experience, I still feel that there might be a rational explanation for what happened. That’s why I’m posting this, to see if anyone has any viable theories. Also, I'm a first-time Redditor, so I apologize if this post is improperly formatted, in the wrong sub, or too long. Anyway...

In July of 2011, I signed a one-year lease for an old (c. 1918), towering row house in Baltimore's Fells Point neighborhood with two very good friends. Let's call them ""Ed"" and ""Mitt."" Within a few weeks of moving in, we'd set ourselves up with a 47"" Vizio HDTV and a Comcast digital cable box, which received approximately 400 channels.

Several months into our lease, Ed, Mitt, and I began noticing that our cable signal would occasionally freeze for about one second, then switch to a new channel without any of us touching the remote. We jokingly attributed the phenomenon to a ""ghost"" in our cable box. Oddly enough, the channel it’d switch to would often be something we were at least marginally interested in watching, e.g. a good movie on HBO or a show we'd never heard of but wound up liking (this is how I discovered Storage Wars on A&amp;E). Now, this observation might be colored by a selective memory bias, but the following sequence of events definitely **is not**:

One Thursday night in late September, Ed, Mitt, and I come home from the bar at around 11:30pm. Ed and Mitt head up to their bedrooms to Skype with their girlfriends (both were in long distance relationships), while I plop down on the couch to watch SportsCenter. When SportsCenter goes to commercial, I reach for the remote to change the channel to Comedy Central, wondering aloud if a new Colbert was on. Before my fingers touch the remote, however, the TV signal freezes for a beat before switching to Comedy Central. I thank the “ghost” for the assist, chalking it up to improbable coincidence. 

When Colbert goes to commercial several minutes later, I jokingly ask the ghost to check what’s on HBO. Once again, the channel switches to HBO before I can touch the remote. Now a bit intrigued, I decide to press my luck by asking him to switch to the HD HBO channel (the box had switched to the non-HD version). As soon as the words leave my mouth, the channel switches to HD HBO. At this point I’m getting sufficiently creeped out, so I call Mitt down from his bedroom to make sure I’m not going insane.

When Mitt arrives, I place the remote in the middle of the room and ask him to say a random channel out loud. He says “History.” Several seconds later, the cable box switches to the History Channel. Now, we *never* watched the History Channel. Even if we’d have wanted to, we’d have had no idea which number it was. Mitt suggests that Ed might be playing a joke on us by changing the channel from a remote in his room, which I refute by arguing that a) it’s totally out of character, b) he’s out of range, and c) he’d never know which number the History Channel was. Just to make sure, I quietly ask the “ghost” to switch to PBS (literally no louder than a whisper). Of course, the channel instantly changes to PBS. Mitt is also now also sufficiently freaked out. On his advice, we do a quick sweep outside to make sure nobody is peering through our windows and changing the channel, finding nothing suspicious.

Next, we call Ed down from his bedroom to do a little experiment. When he arrives, I confiscate everybody’s cell phones (thinking one of them might have an app that simulates a remote) and remove the batteries from the cable box remote. Keeping our eyes on the two living room windows to make sure nobody is there, we ask Ed to name a random channel. He says “ESPN News.” Nothing happens for around 30 seconds. But just as Ed is about to return to his Skype session upstairs, the channel changes to ESPN News. We all fall back on the couch, dumbstruck.

Now, here’s where it gets really weird. After successfully engaging the ghost several more times (if I remember correctly, we had him switch to MASN, AMC, and Cinemax – not that it matters), I try simply *thinking* of a channel (Showtime). Lo and behold, after around twenty seconds of concentrating on nothing but Showtime (specifically the red letter logo and the channel number), the channel switches to Showtime. I shit you not. Ed and Mitt don’t believe me, so I tell Ed to think of a channel as hard as he can. Around twenty seconds later, the TV switches to MTV2. Ed’s jaw drops. He was thinking of “MTV.”

At this point it’s getting pretty late. Ed and Mitt call it a night, as they both have jobs that require them to get up early. (At the time, I was dumbfounded by how they could simply walk away from what was hands down the strangest thing any of us had ever experienced.) Before Mitt goes to sleep, I go up to his room and ask him to think of a single topic, then I head back downstairs to the TV. Seconds later, the cable box switches to Top Gear on the History Channel. I head back up to Mitt’s room to ask him what he was thinking of. His answer: “fast cars.” When I told him the box had switched to Top Gear, he straight up slammed the door in face and NOPED into bed, hiding under his covers.

It suddenly occurs to me that if anyone else (read: the Internet) is going to believe what we've witnessed, I need to record it on video. I head back downstairs, take out my phone, and prop it on the couch so the camera is capturing both the TV and me. I say “BET” out loud. 30 seconds pass. I say it again. A minute passes. I try saying other channels – ABC, Home Shopping Network, MSNBC – but the TV remains on the History Channel. Feeling defeated and foolish for not setting up the camera earlier, I head up to bed.

After that night, the “ghost” in our cable box more or less disappeared. The channel spontaneously changed maybe three or four more times over the next few months, but never to what we were saying or (shudder) *thinking*. Eventually, it stopped happening altogether. I still regret not setting up a camera to capture what was happening, as to this day it continues to defy all logical explanations we can come up with.

So, Reddit, I ask you: What the fuck happened that night? Was there a telepathic ghost manipulating my cable feed? I feel absolutely ridiculous typing that question, and asking it out loud to friends who weren't there just draws concerned looks. But until I figure out what transpired, I’ll remain open to the possibility that there are paranormal phenomena in this world that can’t be explained by science or logic. Even if the phenomena are just benevolent, telepathic, remote-hogging ghosts.


TL;DR: A ghost gained access to our Comcast cable box, and potentially our minds. Yep, I fully realize how dumb that sounds.

Sorry.,Hi_Im_Stupid,41,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1hb7zc/the_house_we_lived_in_a_very_long_post_sorry/,"I stumbled onto this subreddit and figured I should post the tales of the things that happened at our house when we lived in Tyler, TX. I'm not a storyteller, this is more of a listing of events that I can remember happening while we lived in that house. I'm mainly posting this to see if anyone has an explanation for any of this. If this belongs somewhere else let me know; I'm still slightly new to the reddit, so I don't know about all the subreddits yet.        
    
This will probably be very long, so bear with me.
     
About the house: The house was built in a newer housing development just south of Tyler, north of Flint, right next to 49, between S. Broadway and Old Jacksonville Hwy. Near the Centaur Arabian Farms. It's a really nice house with an odd shaped heated pool with a hot tub, most every house in the neighborhood has a pool and/or hot tub. It has 4 rooms, 3 full bathrooms, 2 car garage, laundry room, great room, small foyer, kitchen, dining room, breakfast nook, upstairs storage area  (unfinished attic type entrance from garage), and the secret room. We'll get to the secret room in a little bit. 3 of the bedrooms and 2 of the full baths are on one side of the house, my room with it's own bathroom are on the other side, with it's own entrance/exit to the driveway. I explain this because it may have something to do with stuff, who knows.  The house is currently up for sale, again.     
   
    
Residents (over the years family came and went): Main residents over all time were my parents, my brother, and me. My sister and her daughter stayed for a while. My brother-in-law stayed for a while.    
    
Master bedroom (parents' room): Center of room was always cold no matter what. Sometimes, we were not able to get a phone signal, or calls would drop or be interrupted by some *thing*. Electronics seemed to work fine, except for a few incidents of the clock turning the alarm off on it's own and sometimes changing the time (either the clock time or alarm time, no discernable pattern). (Me and two of my friends were the only one's in the house for this next incident.) Placed recording device in one of the closets in the master bathroom, pressed record, closed closet door and went to another room with my two friends; I went back and grabbed the device after 5 minutes, it only recorded for 45 seconds. All it recorded was us leaving the room (you could hear us talking before leaving the room), then, what sounded like movement across the carpet, a slight hissing sound (like a snake or something), a voice saying ""no"" (almost whispered), then it stopped. While on a phone call with my mother, I was standing in her room; I put the phone on speaker, while she recorded on her end, and asked, out loud, ""What do you have to say?"". I could not hear the response, my mother did (if she still has the recording I will upload it), it said, in an almost demonic voice, ""GET OUT NOW!""  Empty room, had just moved out, with camera placed near wall and pointed towards center of room; it picked up lots of voices and would go in and out of focus the entire time (auto focus was turned off if I remember correctly.) Hi8 Sony Handheld with view screen. Similar, if not exact, to this - [Camera](http://i.imgur.com/C03lbJM.jpg) I no longer have the camera, but I still have the tapes in my storage unit. I need a way to get them onto my computer to be able to upload them.
   
Bedroom #1 (Brother's room): General creepy feeling, feelings of being watched, feeling that someone is right behind you. Reports of being touched and of apparitions. Objects being moved and/or ""missing""; objects that went ""missing"" would reappear in other parts of the house, sometimes within hours, sometimes within weeks, no discernable pattern.     
    
Bathroom: Lights would turn on and off at random times. We had an electrician come and check it out, he had no answer. Toilet would sometimes flush on it's own. It had two sinks, the sink on the right would turn on and off randomly (no discernable pattern), plumber had no idea.    
    
Bedroom 2 (Sister, niece, brother-in-law stayed in room at different times): Same as Bedroom 1.    
    
Great Room/Kitchen/Dining Room/Breakfast nook: Same as Bedrooms. While in the great room I was talking on the phone to my at the time wife and recording with the camera. My wife asks me, ""Who's there with you?"" I respond, ""Nobody."" She then says, ""Oh, it sounds like there are a lot of people there with you. You're not lying to me and having a party while I'm away are you?"" ""No, in fact I'm filming right now. I'll play it back for you when you get home."" The recording would intermittently pick up what she may have been hearing, lots of voices. I could not really make out what any of them were saying. (Next incident) While returning from the grocery store one evening (mother, brother, and I; Father worked nights), we came in through the back, as usual, and noticed a shadow and then the figure of my niece running from the great room, through the kitchen, breakfast nook, area towards the hallway that leads to my room, the secret room, and the garage. We thought my sister was either there visiting or had dropped off her daughter so she could go out for the night with her husband. We walk in, nobody was in the house. There was no way for a person to leave the house in the direction they went without us knowing. We checked everywhere. We called my sister, she was at her house with her family.    
    
Garage: No discernable events.    
    
Bedroom 3/Bathroom 2 (my room): Same as the other bedrooms and bathroom. There were sounds of somebody walking above my room, multiple witnesses. TV would sometimes flicker and the image of a face would appear, then return to normal (no discernable pattern). My computer was almost unusable at times; it would do things on it's own, turn on/off, run/close programs, etc. (no discernable pattern) Tried everything to no avail. I finally just unplugged it and did not use it until I moved out, worked fine at other places. PS2, N64, PSP, Gamecube, all and any gaming systems would be rendered useless while in this room. A knocking sound would come from the bathroom door sometimes (no discernable patterns). Apparition of figure standing in doorway would appear at random and then vanish during some nights (no pattern).     
    
Laundry room: Same as bedrooms. Multiple apparitions and sounds. Everybody gets touched.   
   
Kitchen: Touching, apparitions, voices, opening and closing of drawers and doors. (no pattern)    
   
Storage area: Very, very creepy feeling. Most everybody was scared to venture up to the storage area. I was always tasked with being the one to go up there due to my lack of giving fucks.    
    
The Secret Room: In the hallway that leads to my room, and near the door that leads to the garage, next to the laundry room, there was a door that opened to a closet. Push on the back wall correctly and voila, secret room. We turned it into a make shift office space. Shadows, apparitions, voices, noises, touching, etc. This was probably the creepiest room in the entire house. People could not stand to be in the room for longer than a few seconds without needing to quickly vacate at a very brisk speed. Some people were known to run from the room to get out as quickly as possible.     
    
Backyard/Pool: The pool was very difficult to keep clean. I have never had this much trouble keeping a pool clean. It would constantly turn green. If you walked around the pool, or sometimes just stood out there, you could look across the pool and see yourself. It would not be you exactly. Some things about your features would change, hair may be longer or shorter, clothes may, or may not, be different, etc. (This would also happen inside the house, but happened more around the pool, which is why I listed it here.) Pool/spa features would turn off/on at random (no pattern) Note - Pool/Spa control panel located in laundry room.    
    
Entire house: Dog would chase, bark, and/or growl at what would seem to be nothing. Animals did not like coming into our yard. Squirrels, possums, neighborhood cats, etc. all avoided our yard. The closest they would get would be to walk along the back fence as quickly as possible if they had to go through our area. They would do this to avoid the dog that stayed in the house behind us. Dog in house behind us would randomly bark, growl, and/or scratch at our back fence for no foreseeable reason. I tried to figure out what it was barking or growling at. I thought might be us, or a random animal, but it would do it with nobody, or thing, in, or around, the backyard. The entire house had a extremely creepy, don't want to be here type of feeling. Randomly, when talking on the phone, cell phone or land line, a loud banshee type scream would come over the phone, both parties could hear it. The scream would last anywhere from a few seconds up to about almost two minutes. I have never heard anything like it, before or after, in my life. I could not recreate the sound in anyway to be able to get an explanation for it. I thought, at one point, that it may be interference from a satellite that passed over head, but could not explain why it would also affect the land line, and why there was no pattern to it.    
    
There was never any pattern to any of the things that went on in that house. I would like to go back there and see if this type of stuff is still going on. Nobody has had any problems of this sort, except for a few incidents, since moving out of that house. The incidents that have happened were few and far between and most were not noteworthy to us, or at least not as out there as some of the things we experienced in that house. The only noteworthy incident that I can mention was when I was walking through my parents new house during the middle of the night, between 1:30 AM and 2:30 AM CST (can't remember exact time), when a disembodied(?) hand, that looked like rotting bone and was very cold and felt like a slightly slimier version of a bone hand, reached out and grabbed my left arm. It was just the hand only, a right hand to be exact. I saw it reach out, grab me, and, after holding on to my forearm for around three or four seconds, it just seemed to vanish. It did not let go before it vanished, it was still holding on. It left a hand impression that lasted between ten and fifteen minutes. Also, ever now and again, I will wake up with scratches on my body. They are mostly located on my chest, though they have appeared on other parts of my body. They are three long scratches, around three and half to four inches long, and are evenly spaced by one inch, every time that it happens. There is no pattern as to when these happen. It will sometimes be months between scratches and sometimes they will happen every night for a couple of nights. Not sure if any of that is connected to the house or not, may be something tagged along, I don't know.   
   
There are probably many, many incidents, or stuff, that I am forgetting. If I can remember any of these, I will add them at the bottom with an edit tag.       
    
If you know of how I can get Hi8 tape recordings onto my computer please let me know and I will find my tapes and upload them for your enjoyment. Also, if you have any explanation for any of this stuff, do tell. Any thoughts at all, put them out there, I would like to hear them. Thanks for sticking with this the whole time. I'm currently trying to shove your favorite snack, drink, or item of want through my router right now as you are reading this; I hope it makes it through the internet and to you. :)      
     
Lastly, I would post images from what the current owners posted for trying to sell the house, so you can get an idea of how it's set up. But, due to reverse image searching, I feel it may hurt them. One thing I did notice when looking at their pictures, the pool is still green, it looks like they are having trouble keeping it clean as well. Maybe, the stuff is happening to them as well, or it may just be residual from what may have been there.     
     
   
TL;DR - Lots of creepy, strange, weird things happened, voices, apparitions, moving things, touching, etc. People were too scared to stay in house, especially certain rooms. Sorry it was so long (the girls never complain ;) buh dum tsh).     
   
Edit: It was pointed out to me that I probably shouldn't have mentioned that I recorded stuff and not post what I recorded. When I scanned over the guidelines I thought it said I couldn't post links to videos or youtube. I re-read them and saw that I could post youtube videos if it is OC and related to my post. I apologize for any frustration this may have caused. As soon as I can figure out how to get the recordings onto my computer, I will upload them and post links to them in a new post and reference this post for clarification on the recordings. Again, I apologize for any frustration this may cause to anybody.      
      
Edit 7/13: Okay I have a friend with a VCR that is willing to let me use it. And somebody else has given me advice on how to hook it up to my computer to record it; hopefully I will be able to do that with my system. I will be trying to find a Hi-8 adapter when I get paid next. Now, to rummage through storage and find the box that has the tape.

On more than one occasion, I have had some strange experiences that I've only shared with a handful of people. The first strange experience was when I was in grade school, perhaps second grade. I've always had trouble sleeping and would often catch my mother getting up in the middle of the night to check on me and my sister. One time while I was lying awake, I saw my mom walk out of her room, look into my sister's bedroom and then stand in the doorway of mine to check on me. I didn't say anything because I'd usually be told off for not being asleep. When she moved away from my door I watched her head into the bathroom. The moment she went through the bathroom door, my mother appeared in her doorway and the whole thing happened again. I just decided I was dreaming.

A few years later I had a worse experience. My street is a dead end and the alleys are perfect for racing down. Each kid would take an alley and whoever made it to the end first won, clearly. Well, I knew I was going to beat the girl I was racing, she was always slow, but as I got towards the end of my alley, she was there. She had actually beat me and come out of her alley and into mine just to show off. I was astonished and got off my bike to talk to her. She laughed at how surprised I was and then because we happened to be standing by her backdoor, she went in to get cookies and lemonade. It was a short conversation and I hopped back on my bike to meet her out front. When I came out of the alley, she came out from the one across from me. She was exhausted and slow, like always. It was clear that she hadn't been to her house at all, and when she got off her bike she said she was going to get some cookies and lemonade, did I want any. I was so scared that I was losing my mind that I never told her that I just spoke to her behind her house just a few seconds before and that she already got something to drink.

There are a few other similar stories. Watching events play out, carrying on with my business and then watching it all happen again seconds to minutes later.

I was slightly out of breath afterwards but that may have been the fright. First thing I did was check my watch/motorbike clock to see if I lost any time (throw back to the old X-files)

 The particular road I was on was not sheltered from the wind/elements and was pretty flat/straight with nothing on either side of the road which would cause normal pockets of wind gusts etc.

Not really sure how to explain it, I have hit wind gusts and tail wind which has made things feel a little odd before, but never anything this extreme.

He was a recovering drug addict and swore never to touch anything like that again. We ended our relationship after a lot of arguing and yelling got the better of us. He passed away a little over a month after we broke up from an accidental overdose. Naturally I was devastated. Now to my story...

This incident occurred about 3 weeks after he passed. I had just returned home from work around 6 30 in the evening I was all alone, no appliances were on, except for one light in the living room. So I changed out of my work clothes and started doing my make up. My ex lived three houses down from me and since his passing his room mate and I had become very close and I was getting ready to go visit him. It was very silent in my house, when suddenly I heard a loud slam on my front door. So loud and hard it made my doorbell almost ring. I froze, thinking it was one of my friends stopping by, then it occurred to me that no one had told me they were coming over and why would they not just knock like a normal person?? So I very very slowly walked into my living room and approached the door. I looked out the window. No one. I opened the door (with a bat in my hand, naturally. Gotta be cautious.) No one. I shut the door and turned around only to see that my tv had come on. I looked at the remote sitting across my living room confused. Then I stood and listened very carefully cause I knew in my gut something else was going to happen. Sure enough I hear noise in the kitchen. My keys were laying on the counter and what I heard sounded like someone picking them up and jingling them. I quietly whisper my exes name, and with that everything stopped. I stood in the living room in the same spot waiting for something else to happen, but nothing.

Granted, I have never gone looking for one, these things just don't happen to me.  Possibly because I've lived in brand new suburb housing my whole life until recently.  Now I'm living in a rental that's almost a hundred years old, down in the South.  Onto the experience...

Really early this morning, I think it was around 6 AM, I was awoken for some reason.  Usually at this time my two dogs start to get restless and want to go out and have their breakfast, but they were both sound asleep in bed with me.  Currently the wife is out of town and the only other lifeforms in the house are my two cats.

The door to the bedroom is slightly open, and from the other side, I hear a floor board creak.  Nothing amazing, the old house makes noises.  Then within three seconds I hear another creak, albeit closer.  Then three more creaks, each closer than the last.  And finally, as if out of a horror movie, I hear the door creak open very slowly.

I think it's some sort of intruder so I shout and kick my dogs out of bed to pave the way for my attack, only for them to calmly walk into the kitchen.  I hear no retreating footsteps of an intruder, and check the house to find it empty.  The only thing I can think it was was the cats, as they were waiting at their food dish.  I'm not sure, however, as upon testing this morning, you have to have a pretty hefty weight to make the floor boards creak in my hallway.

Anyway, I just wanted to share with you all.  Freaked the hell out of me. ",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_16bfr0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/16bfr0/my_first_paranormal_experience_occured_last_night/,

During this time I have spent just over 2 1/2..2 3/4 years in Iraq doing various missions, mostly combat oriented, as I was in the artillery and when there was no artillery mission assigned to us we just assumed the role of infantry. Anyway, all this started back during my first deployment. My family has a long, proud, history of military service. There has been someone from my family serving in every major, and minor, conflict the United States (and the colonies) have been in as well as conflicts spanning back to Europe before we came over here. I had always heard stories of the demons soldiers bring back from war (figuratively of course, not ACTUAL demons) and part of me attributes this to my PTSD. My first major engagement occurred back in early 2006. We had been in country for several months at this point. During this time Iraq was a much more violent place than it is now. In fact it's argued that it was more violent then, than it was at any other point during the insurgency. It was night time, I would say around midnight, we began taking fire from some houses located in a palm grove. During the course returning fire, I demolished one of the, what I am only assuming was, a house. Since that night I have had this feeling of a presence near me, always out of vision...or in the corner of my eye but never quite there. Sometimes I dream of it...a man...in a black robe like the kind men wear in the middle east, I forget what they're called and it isn't really important. When I dream I can make out the figure to obviously be a man in such a garment. However they never do more than stand in the corner of a room. When I'm not sleeping I will always see them, like I said, out of the corner of my eyesight, or at times in the corner of a room. 

My girlfriend has always been a perceptive person. When we first started dating she was climbing into my truck one day, around midnight I think, with me and said that there was a man sitting behind me. She said he looked all burnt up and he kept, not so much saying as projecting, that he was sorry for something. When I was in that engagement the building I had blew up, so this struck me as some sort of connection, maybe this burnt man was the same one I had seen in my dreams and in the corners of my vision. I don't know...and honestly I don't know why I'm sharing it. I haven't really talked to anyone about it, save for my girlfriend and like two or three other people.

When I was a kid, I lived in a mildly haunted house.  When I say mildly, I mean little weird things would happen but nothing huge or scary.  Things like shower stopper ends disapearing out of the bathroom when there was no physically possible way and then turning up years later sitting atop the toilet bowl.  Vaguely creepy but not terrifiying, right?  There were always other little things too.  But this incident takes the cake.

For backround, I am not a morning person, and this held true as a child.  It was a Saturday morning, early as hell.  My younger brother and I had stayed up particularly late (or what my 12 year old self deemed late at the time) and, he being an early riser regardless of how much sleep he got, I had politely warned him that if he woke me up early (as was his wont) that I would beat the crap out of him.

So, I was sleeping soundly when I heard a knock on my door.  It registered in my head but only in my dream, you know?  Then it came again, the knock.  Three taps, both times.  The third time I heard the tripple rapping, I was starting to come to.  I grumbled to my brother to leave me the hell alone.  Three more knocks answered me.  Awakening more, I told my brother that I would kick his ass if he didn't go away.  In response I heard three more knocks.

It was at this point that I came out of my sleepy state and recalled that I did not *have* a door.  My brother and I had torn it up while jacking around and, as punishment, my father deemed that I would not have a door, and thus lack privacy, for a month.  Coming to that realisation, I opened my eyes.  At that moment came three more knocks.  

I have terrible eyesight but my hearing makes up for it in subtle ways.  I pinned down the source of the repeated rapping using a crude form of echolocation.  It was coming from direcly in front of me, from inside my room, just above where I should be able to see.  Then came three more knocks, confirming my echolocation, except I still could not see anything.

Up until that point, I had held out hope that it was all my brother screwing with me, but at that moment I gave up rational hope.  Then my *concrete* floors began squeaking.  In front of my bed, just out of eyesight.  At that point, irrational hope set in that the squeaking would creak around my bed and there would be my brother.  I would beat the life out of him but we would later have a good laugh.

When the creaking crept around my bed into my sight range and there was nothing there, that was when I began to panic.  I stared at my floor for a few heartbeats, mind unable to grasp the sheer impossibility of what was happening.  Then, I snapped.  

I threw the comfortor over my head and began praying to God (I was a devout Christian at the time) to protect me.  The squeaks kept coming.  When the noise was even with my head, the left half of my face (the half nearest the noise) went numb and that ear filled with pressure, just like I was riding in a plane.  As soon as the noise passed the area of my head, my ear popped and the numbness vanished.  Then, the sound creaked out of my wall (an experience as odd as it sounds) and I was left alone with my mumbled prayers.  

Eventually, after quite some time had passed and my rational mind returned, I grabbed my glasses and fled my room as fast as my young legs would carry me.  I am not ashamed to say that I was absolutely terrified and can proudly say that I kept complete control over both my bladder and bowels in the single most horrifiying moment of my life.

During it all, I never felt threatened per se, but I cannot see any other conclusion than whatever being I encountered wanted me to know it was there and then do its best to scare the piss out of me.

I'm very new to reddit but the Paranormal section seems like it won't just point and laugh here and I'm dying to know what happened. 

My Grandfather was near death and the family was called in to his room.  Living in the same town as him I was the second person to arrive, the other was my aunt, and the hospice nurse was there as well.  We knew he was maybe minutes away when he suddenly rattled his bed rail and said ""let me out of here guys"" as plain as day.  I said to him ""Grandpa I can't.""  Then he said ""that's ok buddy (he always called me that) they will do it"" and he sort of lifted his finger and pointed towards the corner of the room.  Before I even looked at what he was pointing at I got the coldest feeling I have ever had and I turned and looked and up near the ceiling in the corner was this black mass.  The blackest black I've ever seen.  Now granted the lights were off in the room but it was daytime so it wasn't pitch black in the room by any stretch.  You could have easily navigated the room and even read in the dim light, but this mass was so black.

I was scared, I asked the others in the room if they saw it and they did, my aunt was scared too, the hospice nurse said she had seen it before but offered little details almost implying it was common place.  

A few minutes later my Grandpa's breath slowed and he muttered ""thank you Momma"".  He seemed much more calm and at peace now.  The black mass was gone too.  Finally more family arrived and not long after he passed rather peacefully.  

I'm sad to say I've seen several people die and it is not uncommon for them to make an odd noise or face right before death, but I've never seen anything like what I saw with the black mass and with my Grandpa asking to let him out, then finally being at peace.

So I'm now 18 years old and live with my Brother in our parents house. My Father left us when i was a little two years old child. Then when I was 12 years old I've lost my mother..and there it begins.
First of all I want to tell you what happened before her death. I came back home and she was lying as always sick in her bed, not moving, not eating, just doing nothing.

I was young and I thought, she has a Husband, he will take care of her, I can't do anything for her as a child. So at night I went to her bed and gave her a kiss, that was at eleven o'clock at night. She wished me a goodnight and so I went to my bed, because the next day was the day when the first school day starts.
I fell asleep but one hour later I woke up an that was maybe at 1 AM.
I felt not good, maybe a little bit sick, I turned around all the time and I forced myself to fall asleep again but it didn't work.
I was sweating and my stomach hurt a little bit. I was awake for thirty minutes, then finally I fell asleep.
In the Morning I wake up and heard people voices, the husband of my mother was crying. I know at this moment that she wasn't there anymore... I don't want to go in details but what scared me was that the ambulance man said that she died around 1-2 o'clock, that was then when I woke up and couldn't fall asleep..
Everytime I'm asking myself If i felt that she was dying at that moment.. 
Sometimes it scared me, but sometimes I wish I would know that something was wrong, perhaps I could have saved her..

But now I'll tell you what I experienced after her death. The days after her death were sad, but I don't know, maybe because I always knew that one day it could be late for her, I was not so much afraid of it, to being without her... It was like she was already gone for a long time and that at least the last part of her, her body, left us... Maybe someone understands what I mean. So however, one evening I went to bed to sleep.
I started to dream. I was sitting in our living room, at the table in the kitchen I saw my mothers husband sitting on a chair and reading a newspaper. Then I turned around my head to the floor, where at the right my mother's bedroom was, because there was such a light blinding me and I kept my eyes focused right to this direction. The light becames brighter and I wondered what this could be.Then I had a closer look and what did I see?
I saw my Mother.. She was beautiful, surrounded by a beautiful dress, and then here smile on her face, this smile seemed so unworried, peacefully and I saw that she was happy, but I also saw that something was wrong, that there was something that gave her not the rest she wanted.. 
She came to me and in my dream I know that she was dead, so that couldn't be my mother I told myself.. 
I was looking to my mothers husband and said to him: "" Do you see her? There is my mother!"" 
And he just said : "" I can't see her"" I was a little bit afraid and scared because I didn't know what would happen... 
She came closer and then she stood in front of me. And I was still amazed about her beauty, which I never saw because she was terrible sick since years and an alcoholic for her life.
It was exactly her face, I knew, that's my mother. What then happened makes me still crying after all these years. 
She looked into my eyes and said: I'm sorry ( I think this sorry was for what happened all these years, that she never really could be that mom that I needed) and I saw a tear rolling down her cheek and she said at the end: "" And I miss you"" ..Then I woke up and I was crying.. 

It was sad and happy at the same time. I was sad because I missed her too, because I knew she would never come back, but happy that She gave me for one last time that love, that she never gave me for all these years, because she was depressed and never had feelings like love, happiness or joy, for one last time she told me this words I wanted to hear the most... And that she said goodbye to me.. 
I told my sister that story and she cried too and said: U know what? That was our mommy... I wasn't crying when she said that, I smiled, I was...happy even if it sounds strange...

Maybe that sounds like a story written in a book, because I know about all these stories seeing angels or something like that, but no one, really no one can take me my believe that this was my mom saying goodbye to her little child...I hope that you like my story and that there are maybe also people who made the same experiences",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,1344936928.0,,,True,t3_y6iwl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/y6iwl/my_mothers_last_goodbye/,

I, of course, brushed it off, knowing that he was old and probably just going a bit crazy, seeing things and what not.

Well, anyways, enough with the dog stories. A few months after we got Jack, he started doing the same thing as our other dog. He stood in the same corner as our other dog (his name was Bogey).

At the time my then GF and i were renting a 2 bedroom basement in a Split Duplex in Calgary, in the Fonda area (the exact house is here. http://goo.gl/maps/Re1q we lived on the bottom right.). 4 apartments, each taking a quarter of the house, an upstairs apartment and downstairs on each side of the house. the layout was very straight. there was a hallway with the 2 bedrooms, bathroom and house entrance, then a kitchen and living room with a floating wall between them. our couch was against the floating wall. from that spot, we could see straight down the hallway.

it was about 11 pm, lights were on in the living room and kitchen. Me, my then GF, and a close friend of ours were watching a movie. it was some action movie with guns and explosions.  we were talking about something that happened in the movie being completely unrealistic when i felt something watching me from the hall. i looked over and saw an unusual shadow in the hallway. there didn't seem to be anything making the shadow. i went pale. my friend and GF both noticed me looking down the hall, and looked where i was in time to see this shadow (which we later described as a person crouched down) stand up, turn, and walk into my bedroom. as soon as it was out of sight, i launched myself off the couch over my gf's lap, down the hall, and was in that bedroom within 3 seconds. turned the lights on and..... nothing. 
it was gone.

i did a through search of the bedroom. there was no one there. it also could not have come in any of the windows in the back of the house, they all had bars over them to deter home invasion, and were locked besides.

we all saw it. we all separably wrote down descriptions of it, then looked them over and we ALL SAW THE SAME THING.

i never saw that again, though some other creepy things did happen in that house. i'd be happy to share if there's any interest.

So, I've lived in my house for almost two decades now. We moved here in 1994. I live in a small town in Illinois, close to Wisconsin and Iowa. It's seriously super normal here, if incredibly boring. The house was built in 1880 by a guy named Whiteside and housed his wife and several daughters. Apparently, the house remained in the family until the 30s or 40s and then had a bunch of extremely short-term owners until we moved in.

Things began happening as soon as we moved in - the home was, sadly, in disrepair and to make it safer for two young girls, a toddler, and a soon-to-be-born fourth child, my parents went about renovating. My mom tells me that since she and my dad stayed up late back then, they'd be up until as late as 2 in the morning and they'd smell strange things in our laundry room. Lavender and smoke were the most common. Nobody in our family smoked or used lavender products, especially at 2 am! It wasn't until a decade ago, long after she stopped having this experience, that she learned there'd been a fire in that room in the 1910s or so. I'm pretty sure when I heard that I just laughed nervously like ""yeah okay mom""

I'm a fairly scientific person, so I try to debunk everything that happens. Tapping? PIPES. Noises? IT'S MY CAT! See a full-bodied apparition? DUST., etc., but some of the things that have happened to me are just... weird as shit, especially because they've happened over a number of years!

The most clear experience I've had is upstairs. My bedroom is up there. In the back of the house is a sitting room we've used for various things, as well as the bathroom, and then a hallway down to the bedrooms and the stairs to the first floor. Since I was maybe four or five, I swore up and down a lady was watching me from the sitting room when I went down the hallway. I've been terrified of this woman for years. I have no idea why she's watching me, and why she's ONLY in that room. My bedroom is next to that room, and my bed is against the connected wall. I hear noises in there fairly often, such as shuffling and just strange, creaky noises that aren't just old houses settling - I know the difference by now, haha. I assumed EMF fields for a long time, until I took an EMF detector into the room - it's completely normal. I know one reading isn't good scientific method (lol) but it was still bizarre!

And then my mom gave me even more information earlier, which just made me nope it out of there. Evidently, the wife of the original owner was disabled in some way (I don't know if it was illness or what) and she'd stay pretty much all day in a certain room, with a maid going up there to help her throughout the day. She stayed in that room for years until her death. The room is the creepy room where I felt someone staring at me. Great. I didn't know about this until very recently, and I had no way of knowing a lady was in that room when I was as young as four or five - because nobody else in my family knew, and I never told anyone about this until I confided in my mom that I'd been scared of that room for most of my life.

I hope you enjoyed my story! I have more experiences, both from my house and from various theatres I've performed in. I'll share those later! Thanks, Reddit. &lt;3",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,i,True,t3_1j2vrq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1j2vrq/my_house_is_haunted/,

What do you think?,theYouerYou_,51,21,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1i22ni/ouija_board_prophecy_what_do_you_think/,"Okay, I already know fucking around with ouija boards is not smart. Please don't attack me with that garbage.

My best friend (let's say, Whitney) has an ouija board, and she's supposedly spoken with her grandmother and several other family members several times. According to the oodles of research she &amp; I have done, deceased family members are aware of future deaths &amp; arrivals in the family. We decided to talk to her grandma again. We were both skeptical about the predictions made, but soon after, we had no doubts.

So on Whitney's birthday, we decided to have a little fun. We set up the board &amp; contacted Whit's grandmother on her mom's side. Soon into the 'conversation,' her grandma told us that Whitney's cousin (who was with child at the time) would miscarry. Okay, so we were still a bit skeptical. We played with the board some more. We chatted with granny a good while, and when we were about to say goodbye, the piece spelled out ""Cookie 3 AM"" over and over. There happened to be a large cookie cake on the kitchen table. It was the room next door. I looked at the clock, it was about 2 AM. Whitney asked ""Are you gonna mess with my cookie?"" The piece moved so quickly, our fingertips left the piece as it still moved. (I get chills every time I think about it.) It stopped over the word ""yes."" I looked at Whit &amp; was like ""Want me to go check it out?"" Before I could even look back down at the board, the piece shot over to ""no."" We shrugged it off, said goodbye, and put up the board.

Well there was definitely more creepy shit to come. Whitney and I were sitting on her couch watching a movie. We were both starting to doze off when I hear this noise coming from the kitchen. To me, it sounded like someone shuffling through a box full of Styrofoam peanuts, you know? ""Uh.. Whitney? You hear that?"" She was asleep. I look at the kitchen, and no one's there. I automatically assumed it was Whitney's cat, but that's when I noticed she was curled at Whitney's feet. ""What the hell is that?"" I said in Whitney's direction, stirring her from her sleep. ""Listen,"" I told her. We stared at each other and listened as the shuffling continued. ""Oh God,"" she says, ""The clock."" Goosebumps cover my entire body and I look over. 3:00 AM, on the dot. At that point, we just stared at each other and eagerly listened for the shuffling to stop. As soon as it did, we creeped into the kitchen. We made our way to the table, where the cookie box was sitting patiently. Whitney didn't hesitate to fling the lid open. We found the cookie cake, once laid flat and beautifully with bright colored icing that spelled, ""Happy Birthday Whitney"" in pretty, cursive writing, now crumbled and wadded up in a mound right in the center of the box. It made no significant message or shape, but it was definitely fucked with. It was probably the coolest thing we'd ever experienced, and I have no clue why we didn't take a picture.

Time went by. We didn't mess with the ouija board again until my birthday (a little over a month after Whitney's) came around. This time, I wanted to talk to my grandpa. He passed January 1st, 2011.

So we contacted him, I asked a personal question (just to clarify we were ACTUALLY speaking to my grandfather), and the fun began.

(FLASHBACK -- For the previous 2 weeks, I kept dreaming that I was either pregnant, giving birth, or already had a baby.)

The conversation with my grandpa was amazing. But anyway, before I said goodbye, I asked if there was anything he needed to let me know. He said ""Yes, 2."" I thought about it for a bit, ""You need to tell me two things?""
""Yes.""
""Alright, shoot.""
""Cheater.""
At the time, I was dating this real asshole (Let's name him Anthony). I knew he was no good, but I hadn't had proof yet &amp; I was incredibly stupid for him regardless.
""Who?""
""Boy.""
""... Anthony? Is Anthony cheating on me?""
""Not yet.""
Sure enough, about a week later, I found out about all the other girls. Scumbag.
""Okay, what's the other thing?""
""Baby 2""
""Oh shit... What??""
""Baby 2""
""2 what?""
""2 years""
I didn't respond. I was a bit shocked. The piece began to move again.
""Boy. Blond hair. Blue eyes.""
""I'm going to have a baby boy, with blond hair and blue eyes, in two years?""
All I could think was ""Please say no, please say no, please say no.""
""Yes.""
GOD DAMMIT.
""Am I going to have this baby before I graduate?""
""No.""
""Will I be with the father still? Will he at least help me?""
""No. Single.""
Why. Why me.
That hasn't happened yet.

So about the miscarriage prophecy.

As you read earlier, Whitney's grandmother warned that Whitney's first cousin, Sara, was going to lose two children before a successful pregnancy. Almost exactly a year ago, she lost her unborn baby girl. It was preeeetty traumatic for their family. So shortly after, she announced her second pregnancy. Whitney and I braced ourselves for another miscarriage. Luckily, she carried her (now 9-day-old) son with zero problems. He was born a little early, but is healthy.

So I'm unsure if the predicted miscarriage was wrong, or if she just lost the baby super early in her pregnancy. I've heard a good percentage of women miscarry before they even know they're pregnant, but that could be bullshit. I dunno.

So what of my pregnancy prediction? If it's true, it would happen around or shortly after this September. Thoughts? I'd LOVE to hear about your ouija board experiences.

Because this is already ridiculously long, I'll wait to tell you guys about the message my grandpa left me in a lighthouse puzzle.

I used to have tremendous paranormal experience when I was younger. I used to have sleep paralysis all the time and I can't tell weather it was lucid dreaming but I felt like I had been places and all of a sudden feel a shock and then wake up. I also used to hold seances with my friends and we've had really strange and accurate responses to certain things that we had asked. 

So here is the story. I had a friend from high school that I haven't spoken to in a long time. He is half Caucasian/half Korean. He was always selling drugs and guns so I decided to stop associating myself with him a while back. We went our separate ways. I got a job at a Loan Office and he kept selling drugs. I got a call about 4 days ago from him and he wanted to meet up with me to talk to me about stuff after work so I did. We went to a Taco Bell to eat and he was telling me about how the Mexican drug cartel is out to kill him because he was fronted 10 grand of cocaine that he was supposed to sell for them (which he had done before). It turns out his roommate robbed him so he had to tell them that and they wanted to kill him. He was trying to get money from me so start flipping cocaine to potentially pay them back soon. I just started my job and have rent and car payments so I could only give him about 80 dollars. I then went home and about 2 days later on the news a young male got shot and killed on the same block that he lives at. Right after I saw that a few of my old high school buddies called and told me that was him that got killed... So then i immediately call him and he picked the fucking phone up... He sounded different and didn't say much other than, ""I'm okay man, i'm fine"" and then hung up.. Turned out it really was him that got killed and I spoke to him after he had passed.

First, some background.

A few times throughout my life, I've had some rather odd experiences that, while probably having rational explanations, I've hidden away in a folder in my mind labelled ""Paranormal."" Four years ago, I met my current boyfriend and after a year of dating, I moved into the house he was staying in. It's him, our older roommate that we rent from, and me living in a three bedroom house. 

Early in the relationship, he told me a few creepy stories about supposedly paranormal stuff going on in the house. It's the same old song and dance: hearing your name in the middle of the night, hearing footsteps when no one else is home, and a general feeling of not being alone. After I moved in, I encountered my own creepy situations, though I'm still living here so I clearly don't feel like I'm in any sort of danger. One of my best friends has a boyfriend/fiance that, supposedly, is a sensitive. The story goes that after attending a party we had here, they left and he mentioned to her that there was indeed a ghost and went on to accurately describe our own personal reactions to her (we had always considered it a female, going so far as to call it Delilah). My friend insists she never told him any of the information, which makes sense because he hates talking about paranormal stuff, supposedly because he's had to deal with a lot of it in his life. 

All of this got me thinking, though. There's three guys living in a house, two of which are a couple. I really don't want to seem crude, but, I mean, dirty stuff happens in this house. So, without further ado, my question is this: Is this ghost watching us when we're doing stuff we only do when we think we're alone? Is it watching us masturbate? Is it watching us have sex? Does it politely leave the area when private stuff is going on? Does it even care?

Alright, well here it is:

I'm going to sound like an absolute nut but bear with me. I'm only telling my story here, under anonymity, and just praying no one I know finds this! But my youngest sibling, we'll call her Pam, well Pam is 9 and our parents were evicted a few months ago because they're poor and make horrible choices.
Pam has been out of school since about March that I'm sure of, my mother's fault, poor kid doesnt know she has to repeat 3rd grade. They moved into a remote log cabin (no really) with my grandparents and she's REALLY depressed. She spends all day alone on the computer, she lost her house, her school, her friends, all her siblings are nearing 30 and living faw away. I try to see her as much as possible but I'm not in the best of health at the moment. She's my whole world and if I had the financial means to do so, I'd snatch her up in a heartbeat. 
Anyway, sorry this pulls my emotions and its hard to summarize such a gift to this world and how tragic her life has become, mirroring my own. She doesn't sleep much, she's sick more often than not, I could just cry myself to death because I cant help her.

About two weeks ago I took the train to spend the night and hang out with her. She draws amazingly well, but her pictures are so violent and gory now. She turned her barbies into monsters and witches. No future serial killer here, just a major horror fan. She's obsessed with ghosts and death, she told me she has a black cat following her but that he's more of a shadow. She also said she's afraid to sleep without tinkerbell, a light she says she sees and thinks is tinkerbell. But what chilled me to the core was the shadow people above her bed that she ""talks"" to in her dreams sometimes and when she wakes up in the dark she still sees them. I asked her what they say but she doesn't remember except for being scared. When she was 3 she told me all about how she died in a fire in a red house and she had a different mommy and daddy. 

Big sigh, okay, here goes nothing and God I hope my family aren't redditors...

I was born into the Leeds family, you know the tale, Mother Leeds cursed her 13th child and he was born a devil. There are shows, movies, restaurants, sport teams etc based on this ""devil"" presidents and Napoleon claim to have seen it. Imagine my mortified face whenever yet another relative is interviewed about ""the curse"" on television.
Well, there are people from my hometown, where my grandparents reside, who think we are connected to Satan. They used to steal my mothers pets when she was a child and theyd find them mutilated in the woods, sacrificed to Satan. Every paranormal everything comes back to us. Our family history is riddled with tragedy after tragedy. My uncle swore a demon was chewing on his feet at night he was so frightened he shot himself in the head and survived. He still wont talk about it. My grandmother has been attacked by birds, my mother nearly died twice after her horses spooked up and went after her. We are not allowed to say ""drop dead"" or anything like it, because its happened several times. My mother has predicted dozens of family deaths within days of their passing. All of these stories (and there are many many more) are second hand to me. I thought it was cool and have always had a healthy interest in the paranormal. 
Freshman year I'd stopped believing in God, we were always poor and sick with all kinds of ailments. Everything that could go wrong did, a literal Murphys law. I had been molested and horribly abused mentally and physically by relatives while my parents spiraled into self destructive behaviors of their own. I was isolated in school for being ""the devil girl"" and cast out of sleep overs in the middle of the night upon revealing my parentage. I had been kidnapped twice by relatives who prayed over me for my soul only to beat and molest me once alone.
It was around this time I started having sleep paralysis and insomnia issues. I started seeing people darker than the night in my room just hovering above my bed, too afraid to move or speak. Every night I'd see them and have vivid nightmares of being burned raped and beaten. We even had someone put snakes in our home and burn a pentogram into the lawn.

I found out later why my birth father was in jail, I was told as a child he was in the army. My evil paternal grandmother took me to see him annually until I was ten. I realized it was prison long before but never dared to ask why. Turns out he brutally beat sexually assaulted and burned a woman alive in a dumpster. I asked him why he said he was young and it wasnt his fault, he wrote me a letter saying he loves fried chicken because cracking the bones reminded him of her crackling burning body. Needless to say contact was ceased. Ive read articles of him describing her death without emotion, he claimed to hear the devil through led zeppelin records, blamed my families curse, and said he tried to make it seem as if a ""mad strangler"" attacked her. If you're sluethy this happened in the 80s at a well known army base in the ""devil"" state. Please refrain from posting those links here for my safety and privacy. He does not know what I look like nor my name.

Hes set to be released soon into the same town as my family, and by soon I mean August 15th. I've moved away in fear, Ive always felt like if I stayed there I would die. Im married and now have a strong relationship with God, all the shadows and nightmares have ceased for 2 years until yesterday.

I was dreaming that I was at a party and there were several dead relatives, one being my molestor who died of testicular cancer after I told him to drop dead, and of course, my father. I left terrified he'd turn around and see me, then my dream flashed forward to lying in bed with my husband. When I opened my eyes in the dream a shadow person was nose to nose with me and in my father's voice it said ""Mother and Pam"" except it had said their names. I woke up startled to see this white orby looking thing with a tail float out of my room.

Im absolutely terrified and asking that you pray for them. I wish I could give you a  name, but maybe God will understand the sentiment. I think they are preying on Pam because she is a depressed child, as I was, they're trying to lure her from God. I just dont know what to do. Ive resigned myself to killing my birth father.. He is obsessed with my mother and this is the only way to be sure they are safe. Call it bullshit, but I had  to get this off my chest I have to show them that Im not afraid.

The first experience happened years ago. I think I was in the seventh grade (I'm in my second year of college now). I used to have a neighbor that was basically my best friend until high school. Every so often, I'd go over to her house and we'd just hang out to kill time. Most of the time, her little sister would hang out with us too. 

One night, I remember going over to their house because we both just got Nintendo DS's and we wanted to play games with each other. After a while, we got bored of the games so we started taking stupid pictures on one of those disposable cameras. Eventually, of course, we ran out of film and set the camera down on a desk across the room. I should mention that we were the only three (me, her, and her sister) at the house. The mother was at work, and didn't get home until very late. We ended up going back to playing games, and suddenly, we all three hear the sound of a picture being made. We thought at first something fell on the camera and took a picture, but we remembered there was no film left. We ignored it, and eventually I went home for the night.

About a week later, she comes to school and tells me she needs to show me a picture. Instead of just one picture, though, she hands me the whole stack and says ""count them."" I was confused, but I started. The camera she had only allowed 40 pictures, so when I got to 41, I was a little confused. However, when I looked at the picture, I was dumbstruck. It was a picture of the three of us, sitting on the couch, playing our games. No one could have taken that picture, and shouldn't have been able to take that picture with that camera. To this day, I still wonder if it was some sort of paranormal entity. As a side note, I do believe that house is haunted. I see things a lot over there, but also, many people have moved in and out of that house over the last few years. None of them stay longer than a month.

**tl;dr: Went to a friends house (who's house might be haunted) while her mom was gone. Played with a disposable camera. When pictures were developed, there was one more picture than there was film, and the picture was of us sitting on the couch. No one could have taken that picture.**

My second experience happened eight months ago. This one is much less physical and much more personal. 

At the time, this sounded really stupid. Even when I talked to my mom about it the next morning, we laughed it off as me just being a dumb ass. But the more I think about it, the creepier it makes me feel.

Now, keep in mind, I have never sleep walked. Not once. Ever.
Also, I remember doing this. So I don’t really believe it was sleep 
walking.

Anyways, at about 2 in the morning, I woke up. And I got this awesome idea to go tell my mom about the man in my room. And I’m sitting in bed for a good five or ten minutes seriously contemplating if I should or not, saying “Well, I don’t wanna wake her up. But, this is super important. Like, she needs to know now.” I mean, I’m talking to myself like there’s someone else in there with me. Also, my mother has a VERY difficult time sleeping, so me waking her up is a very big deal.

I get up after a bit, walk to my mom’s room, and ask “Hey mom. You awake?” Thankfully, she was. So, I did’t feel bad about waking her up. Then it goes,

**Me:** There's a man in my room.

**My mom:** What?

**Me:** Never mind. He didn't want me to tell you. He's angry now.

And then I just went back to bed.

I can’t explain it. Maybe I'm overreacting. Or maybe I really did have a visitor. But I'd just like some other opinions on this.

**tl;dr: Woke up, walked to my mom's room, told her there was a man in my room. Immediately said ""Never mind, he's angry."" and went back to bed.**

But the simplicity and strangeness of what happened has always stuck with me. Here goes:

A couple of years ago, I was over at my friend's house with my brother, my friend's brother, and two other friends. The six of us were alone at the house and talking in the kitchen. My friend and I stood next to the island while the other four sat around the kitchen table approximately five feet away.

I'm in the middle of telling a story, nothing real special, when I reach over and grab a drink from my can of soda. I put it back down, look up at my friend, and talk for another minute or so before I decide to take another sip of my delicious fizzy beverage. As I reached over to grab the can, when my hand was still about four inches away, it moved.

It fucking moved about six or ten inches toward my friend. *All by itself*. I looked up at my friend, who was staring down at the can and wearing a face that made it seem as if Elvis himself rose out of the floor and slapped him upside his head. I asked him if he saw what happened, and he just nodded. No words.

It wasn't just the two of us that saw it, either. After about five seconds my friend sitting at the table muttered a soft ""What the *fuck* was that?* None of us have ever been able to explain what happened, but we all saw it. Nothing more happened; no voices, no coldness, no things that go bump in the night.

I was wrong. She was wary to talk about this incident which happened 2 years ago.

First off we are of a eastern European background and there are remote villages where magic is seemingly practiced. I have heard of white witches, and black witches. This grandma of my mother was a black magic witch.

Anyway, when she got old she grew very ill and couldn't die for years. She was suffering but never could die. I never knew the full story until today my mother told me that she wanted to ""pass on"" her magic somehow to one of our family members but no one visited her or wanted anything to do with her. Ultimately she ended up giving a little girl this power and died the week after she did. Its like she couldn't die unless she transfered it.

The weird stuff started happening after her death when my mother and my aunt were tasked with going to her house in the village and getting her stuff to prepare for the funeral. So a week after her death they drove to this remote village on the outskirts of Tver.

As soon as they walked into the old house they smelled cigarette smoke. This was odd but not too odd since the grandma witch did smoke heavily. What shocked them was when they walked into the kitchen and she swears to me that a lit cigarette was in an ashtray, burning. This left them confused because the lady had died a week before and only they had keys to the house.

After trying to explain it away they had to stay the night because the drive was far and they were attending the funeral the next day. 

At night was when things started getting unpleasant. Both my mom and my aunt witnessed shadows, the overwhelming smell of cigarettes, and kitchenware clanking throughout the night. 

I spoke to my aunt and she looked scared and had goosebumps and I asked her why. She said that she woke up for no reason at 3 in the morning and saw a shadow thing/person hunched over in the corner of the room. She said it looked like it was crawling on the ground and then scurried up a wall, then she started screaming.

Now I am a skeptic but this is my family and they have never seen or experienced anything like that in their life.

Could r/paranormal shed some light on how this happened, and if black magic really is that powerful?",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1d1efv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1d1efv/mother_just_told_me_about_a_family_member_who/,
1362620662.0,29,self.Paranormal,19te5g,My family's experience in our 100 year old house.,zomystro,39,10,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/19te5g/my_familys_experience_in_our_100_year_old_house/,"The house that I grew up in as a kid had been bought by my Dad from his Mom. He also lived there as a kid and wanted to keep it in the family when my Grandma decided to sell it. I moved there when I was very young and shared a room with my brother. When I got a little older my parents decided I needed my own space and turned, what was at the time, being used as storage into a 2nd bedroom for me. I was always crept out by this room because they always kept the door locked (probably so we couldnt play with all the boxes in there) but it was right at the top of the stairs and there was always a really cold draft only on the very top step... almost as if you were walking through an invisible wet blanket.

Anyway once i moved in I started noticing strange things happening in the evenings. The most prominent thing happened when I was about 7 years old. I was asleep and I woke up to my blankets hovering over the bed, as soon as i opened my eyes they were ripped off the end and laying on the ground... but no one was in my room. I jumped up, ran down the stairs to where both of my parents were watching TV and told them what happened... they didnt let on that they were freaked out but they were. Another experience I had was there was a tall closet in the corner of the room that was independent from the wall. On numerous occasions i swear i could see it moving across the floor. That room was also really cold compared to the rest of the house and I always felt like someone was watching me when I was in there. I continued living in that room until we moved out of the house and had a few other strange occurrences during my stay, like objects being moved around and things like that. 

A few years later we were discussing that event at a family gathering and I started to hear stories from other family members who had also stayed in that room who had never shared their experiences. 
My grandma would have been the first in the family to experience anything. She said that more than once she woke up to the feeling of someone sitting on the bed beside her. One of those times it was right on her feet and lower legs.

When my Dad was a kid it was his room for a while. Since it was a really window moldings had warped and couldn't be opened and had they been nailed shut to prevent rattling. My dad says on numerous occasions he would wake up to the curtains ""blowing in the wind"" and when he would get up to check the window - it was obviously closed. He also woke up one night to the closet banging against the wall (same as mine). 

Once my dad became a little older he moved into a bigger room and his younger brother stayed in there. My dad is quite a bit older than his little brother and he and my mom (who were dating at this point) were babysitting him. Only the 3 of them were at home. He heard his brother screaming from upstairs and he ran up to see what had happened. He had seen a hand come around the door and then it slammed shut.

My dads sister claims that she rolled over while she was in bed and saw someone walk out of her room, when she got up to investigate, no one was there.

I don't know of the history of the house or anything about the previous owners but everyone seemed to be sick all the time and we didnt notice it until we moved and realized that no one had had a cold in a few months. Men seemed to have really bad luck in that house. My grandmas 2nd husband died there right after I was born, a great uncle died the day following a week stay at the house and once we sold the house to move to Canada the new family that moved in dealt with a death less than a month after they moved in. Their youngest son (who was probably no older than 8) choked at the dinner table and died before he got to the hospital.

When we went back to the UK in 2007, my Dad (who is a skeptic) went to visit the house and see if he could get some photos. The new family who lived there were home and invited him inside. As soon as he walked through the door he felt violently ill and had to excuse himself to throw up. He had a migraine for about 20 minutes after he left and then he was totally fine like nothing had ever happened. 
Since this house I have never had any strange experiences, although the dark still freaks me out lol... I don't know what it was to this day that was doing this but it has crept the whole family out. Even my mom wouldn't sleep without the hallway light on and if my dad ever had to go out of town we were forced to stay in her room with her.

The old man tells him to look at the camera, Nico looks at the camera and sees something so he runs back outside this time with a flashlight turns it on points it at the direction of where this ""person"" is at and the light starts to flicker points it away from where this supposed person is at and it stops and repeats it once more gets the same thing.

I'm from Morgantown, WV. My family lives in the Cheat Lake area, which is a pretty wealthy area. There are a few mansions that dot the shores of the lake with docks along the water. There is one mansion that is relatively new (I'd say 15 years old at the most). It's probably the most recognizable property on the lake. (I need to go get picture.)

After a New Year's party at my house, a couple of my friends went to stay with their friend who lives at this mansion. They told me they don't like staying there--that it's definitely haunted. I said, no way, I mean, that place is pretty recently built. My friend told me that she had stayed in this mansion a few times before, around Christmas time. She said she's seen a young boy and a young girl, both wearing winter garments and holding Christmas presents, in the basement of the home. She also saw a man in overalls walking along the docks of the property at night.

For those of you that have seen The Mothman Prophecies, you're familiar with the Silver Bridge collapse on December 15, 1967. Everyone in West Virginia would cross the bridge to Ohio to Christmas shop. There was a traffic light at the end of the bridge as people were coming home, and the bridge was packed with cars. It collapsed from a structural failure with people trapped in their vehicles. 46 died. Rescue and salvage crews found wrapped gifts floating in the collapse wreckage.

So this is where everything comes together. The man who built this mansion decided to get some cheap steel for the foundation. Where can I get cheap steel? Oh, there's this steel lying around from the Silver Bridge collapse down in the southern part of the state. So he buys this steel and uses it to build his home.

So now his home is made with cursed steel from Silver Bridge. And the spirits that haunt this house get especially perturbed around Christmas time when they died in that tragedy.

Interesting, if you're into detective work.",,45,13,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/tbdwh/how_i_figured_out_who_possibly_haunts_my_house/,"Hi guys,I'm new to this sub, but thought you might be interested in my story, though it's not very out-of-the-ordinary compared to other /paranormal posts. Here goes:

My parents moved into a three-story house back in the 70's, (where they still live) and raised me and my two siblings there. We rent out the first floor and live on the second, and have always used the third floor for a big bedroom. From what I've researched, I know that the house, in some form, has existed since the mid-1800s (In New England, everything's old). Since childhood, I've felt at times that I was being watched, have heard doors shut on their own, have seen toys turn on by themselves, etc. You know, the basic ""Could there be a ghost?...Nah!"" kind of stuff. 

Anyways, last summer I moved back home for a few months to help out my parents with odd jobs and general upkeep on the property; winter storms had uprooted an enormous evergreen tree and some bushes in front of the house. I do landscaping and was happy to help. I was working with earth pretty deep below the surface, and found some interesting stuff (picture a giant 8'x8'x4' hole where the tree's roots had been). There were some white porcelain plates with blue painted detail, some silver utensils and several big planks of wood that looked like they were part of beams, or some house structure. They were, unsurprisingly, rotted and brittle. Some were up to ten feet long and about a foot in girth. There were *tons* of big, rusty nails scattered about - so many that I had to be careful of how I moved. There were also coins, which were too eroded to have visible markings. Lastly, there were several pink and purple ceramic beads together in one spot, which were clearly part of a necklace but the string had rotted away. 

I showed the treasures to my family, but they didn't think much of it. My mother said that an old neighbor once mentioned that a fire had taken place decades ago on the plot, and that these things were probably just left behind when they filled in the property post-fire. I just shrugged it off.

Then it got weird.

A few weeks into my work, I started to have vivid, extremely realistic visions while sleeping in my old bedroom. One night, I awoke to find the dark silhouette of a woman standing over me, looking down. I couldn't make out much detail, but I do remember the outline of a hat on the figure's ""head"". For some reason, it reminded me of the fancy hats people wore to church back in the day. I felt so afraid that I couldn't move. I closed my eyes and told myself it was a weird lucid dream. I felt goosebumps all over my body, but was sweating profusely. My chest felt heavy and I could feel my heart pounding in my throat. Somehow, though, I managed to get back to sleep. 

I told my parents and siblings, but they didn't believe me. It must have been a dream. I started to believe this, too, until we had a huge family reunion on the fourth of July. There were relatives there who I didn't really know, but got into an interesting conversation with two older, female distant cousins. My extended family had never really moved away from our city, and the adults all played together in the same neighborhood when they were children, as far back as the early 60s. Somehow, we got into discussing paranormal-type stuff, and I mentioned the weird occurrence that happened a few weeks before. To this, one cousin said something like, ""Wait you're Bill's kid, right? (my father)..And he still lives over on XYZ Street, right?"" I said yes, and the two women exchanged a look of utter shock. They explained that they used to play in my house sometimes, back before my parents had ever lived there. Apparently, one of our distant relatives or family friends (This is still unclear) lived in the house for a short time, and all the kids used to bounce around from house to house, playing in the neighborhood as kids do. They said they stopped going to my house when they started to experience unexplainable happenings as well: a laundry list of all the things I had been experiencing since childhood. I've since moved out.

About a month ago, I came across a site through which you can look up your property and track down the names of the people who lived in your house in 1940, all using census data. After about thirty minutes of desperation, I finally found the information for our house: one family, including a husband, wife, mother-in-law, and six children lived in my house. By the wife's name was an asterisk, with a note which read ""unable to work - very ill"". 

Did the woman die shortly after this data was recorded? If so, the ghost of the young mother could be the explanation for all the weird happenings in my house over the years. Who knows. I still don't understand. Like, does the fire have anything to do with it? What exactly happened in the fire? Was the family there when it happened? My sister, who finds this all very interesting, believes that I unearthed property belonging to ghost (whoever it is), which caused it to increase its activity, hence my visions. Farfetched or legitimately spooky?

Anyways, here's the site

http://stevemorse.org/census/unified.html

It takes some time, but definitely worth it. 

**TL;DR** I always felt there was a ghost in my house. I used released census data to find out who it could possibly be: a young woman who was reportedly ""very ill"" in 1940.

I'll just explain some particular instances of what may have been visitations. Then I'll get to the reason for the title of this post. Apologies in advance. This will long and boring.

As long as I can remember, I suffered from night terrors and sleep paralysis. I don't remember any of the terrors, but I remember each episode of sleep paralysis.

**The Old Lady**

It all began with the old lady. I'd hear her down the hall, dragging one foot after the other. Each step brought her closer to my room. I could never move or even close my eyes. The door would creak open, and I'd see her silhouette. She was hunched over. She wore some sort of loose fitting robes. A hood shrouded her face.

I'm actually scaring myself now.

The old lady would creep towards my bed. I would try to scream, but the best I could manage was a pitiful moan.

Then she would lean over my bed and... the moment before I could see her face, she'd be gone and I could move and scream again.

This happened countless times, and only once, when I was maybe 12 or 13, did I actually see her face. It was a familiar face, and not particularly frightening. It was similar to my aunts on my mom's side of the family (the Lebanese/Armenian side).

If I recall correctly, that was the last time I experienced that particular episode until I was much older. I was in the Air Force. Just like when I was a kid, she came down the hall and into my down room. This time she couldn't seem to find my bed, which was in the corner. You had to turn to see it. She walked past my bed, and then she was gone. 

That was the last I saw of her.

**My mom's best friend. Died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.**

My mom's best friend killed himself when I was maybe fifteen or sixteen. No one is really sure why, but it might have had something to do with his boyfriend at the time.

The guy was really cool, and thought of him as part of the family.

Anyway, so around that same time I was going through some typical teenage angst and depression, including suicidal thoughts. I can't say how serious I was about suicide; but I'd think of it often, and felt more at ease when I did.

I slept on the living room couch often at that age. My parents didn't get along and slept at separate ends of the house, so I kind of had that whole area to myself.

Anyway, so one night I was lying on the couch, pondering suicide. Then he was standing there, my mom's friend, just a foot or two away from the couch. I wasn't paralyzed. But I couldn't turn away.

His face was swollen, and it was an almost pale blue. There was a hole in his shirt, crusted with blood, where his heart would be. That's where he shot himself.

He looked down at me and said, ""Don't do it, Kurt. You don't go where you think you go.""

And then he was gone.

I told my mom about it the next day. She wasn't the one who found his body, but she saw him before he was hauled away. She said his face was swollen. But a lot of dead people have swollen faces. That's not so strange.

Then I described what he was wearing. It was exactly what he had on the day he died.

I never seriously considered suicide after that.

**My childhood friend killed himself too**

Rich was my best, closest friend. He also had a lot of emotional issues and a fucked up family. A year or two before I left for the Air Force, his parents divorced and he moved out to a neighboring city. It was a whole fucked up situation and I just kinda stopped hanging out with him.

A few years later, I'm home on leave. I start thinking about Rich, and how bad I feel for abandoning him. As I search around for his number, the phone rings. It's the parents of another friend. Rich had been found parked alongside an old country road, dead from car exhaust asphyxiation.

I was laying in bed a year or so later, feeling really guilty about Rich. Always felt like I abandoned him when he needed me most. Over and over again I'd just repeat how I wished he was there, so I could apologize, tell him what a terrible friend I'd been, and ask for his forgiveness.

I rolled over, facing the wall. And that's when I felt him there, standing over the bed. I don't know how, but I knew it was him. In my mind, I saw his swollen, discolored face. It looked nothing like the the showing at the funeral. There, his face was caked in makeup. Hard to the touch (yes, I touched him).

I was terrified. Too afraid to turn around and face him. So, I just cowered in bed with my back to Rich until I no longer felt his presence.

**Recently**

My episodes sleep paralysis tapered off quite a bit as I got older. I have them now maybe once or twice a year. Sometimes they're not even frightening at the start. My last two were *really* close to lucid dreams, except my physical body couldn't move.

During one of them, it was like I was watching a film projected on all the walls of my room. In the dream/film, I was hanging out with a couple, helping cook a turkey. It was interesting and quite a trip.

Then things in the film started to get weird.

Then they got downright frightening.

Then I heard the voices. And, over them, I heard The Voice.

**The Voice**

In every one of the last ten or so episodes of sleep paralysis, there has been one constant: The Voice.

Sometimes the episodes start with shadows that become twisted creatures that swirl around me. Then come the voices. Dozens of them. Whispering. Laughing. Deep voices. High pitched voices. I don't know if they whisper in another language, in jibberish, or if I just can't understand them because they all talk and laugh at once.

Then I hear The Voice.

The Voice is loud. And, unlike the others who swirl along with the shadows, I hear The Voice as if its right next to my left ear (which is, oddly enough, the same ear that gets clogged most often).

Before I hear him, I'm terrified. But, after I hear him in my ear, I feel a kind of Lovecraftian terror I couldn't possibly describe.

Up until Saturday night, I can't recall whether or not The Voice has actually spoken to me. It laughs, I know that.

That brings us to Saturday night. I'd fallen asleep on the couch, and began a slightly off, yet fairly routine dream which I can hardly recall. I was somewhere doing something, when things started to get weird. And, for some reason I asked myself, ""Am I possessed?""

I heard the same voices, swirling around. Laughing, whispering.

Then I was back on the couch, paralyzed.

The Voice laughed in my ear and said, ""Correct.""

Edit: Added something I remembered about Saturday night.

Edit II: My wife often says that I ""go places"". I often do things I don't remember doing, or say things I don't remember saying. It's never violent or prolonged. Sometimes I'll find myself in a room and not know why I'm there.

I read someones post about past life experience and it reminded me of something that I experienced a few years back. I went out of the country to a resort in the Caribbean for some vacation time. I would say it was either my first or second night there and I went to sleep and dreamed that I was in the very same room in the same bed with a girl. I can remember her vividly. She had white sweat pants, a pink tank top, a pink thong (white pants) and pink flip flops. Mind you I have never seen this girl in my life. So in my dream we were in the bed making out getting ready to have sex. I wake up the following morning and grab breakfast with some cousins then head to the pool that had a bar. It became later in the evening when I was shooting pool in one of the areas and guess what. The girl from my dream was standing in front of me with a group of friends. Needless to say I was in shock. This was the same girl that I saw in my dream. I had never seen this girl in my life and she was wearing the exact same clothing from my dream. A pink tank top, white jogging pants, a pink thong, and pink flip flops. I was speechless and did know what to do. 

I will be up for another hour or so if you guys are interested in discussing.

As I start to coast down this stretch I started to hear another biker came up along side me, I couldn't see much but I heard the rider's bike and it had to have been about 5 feet away from me, I was going to say hi but a car started to come around the bend a head of me so I turned off to the side of the road and thinking the rider was going to do the same but as soon the headlights shined my way I looked only to find that no one was there. 
It caught me off guard but I knew I heard another bike, as soon I got to my in-laws to meet up with my wife and son, I had to tell them my experience. I soon learned that there was an accident on the same stretch of road, a hit-n-run and a young man was killed there 2 years earlier. Could of that been his ghost I hear riding along beside me?

Also, sorry about length. TL;DR to follow.  
When I was about 4 years old, my family moved into the house that I would grow up in. The house didn't seem to have much of a history, apparently. The property was an acre in size, so it was pretty large for our family home. I heard my dad talking about how the property, and how the backyard was so big because it and the properties surrounding it used to be part of an orchard and nursery. The land was to be split up and sold after the orchard began to fail, and eventually the owner, who lived on the orchard, had lost everything, and hung himself from a tree.  
Now that's just the story—my mom never believed that that's what really happened. Years had passed, because the house was obviously built after that incident, and nobody that I've ever asked really knew much about what my house's history was.  
Anyways, now on to the good stuff. When we first moved into the house, I was about four years old. Apparently I used to wake my mom up at the crack of dawn and ask her why it smelled like Nanny, (I call my grandmother ""Nanny,"" and she is an avid smoker.) Eventually my mom got up and explored the house, and realized that the kitchen smelled like cigarette smoke and coffee, even though my parents didn't drink coffee or smoke.  
As we started to recognize the smell, it grew less frequent. Mom figured that the previous owners must have left behind the smells, because they're both a very distinct smell and they probably just needed time to fade away.  
Later, when I was six or seven, I started to concern my mom with my sleeping habits. My mom insisted that my door should be open at night, I guess just because of an overprotective instinct. But the problem was that I would stay up late every night, unable to sleep. Sometimes my parents would check on my sister and I before the went to bed. I could hear them enter the hallway, make a couple shuffled footsteps, then turn around to go upstairs.  
Now I don't remember this at all, but apparently my mom would hear me calling for her when I was in bed. She would rush downstairs and ask what I needed, but I would just ask her why she was standing in the hallway for so long. Se explained that she was in bed upstairs, but I explained that I clearly saw her shadow. I thought she was spying on me, waiting for me to go to bed, but she wasn't.  
Eventually it got to the point where I decided that I was going to surprise her one night while she was ""spying"" on me. So when I noticed the shadow, I snuck out of bed, and jumped out of the door. I expected to see my mom, but instead I saw a shadow turning the corner. I ran after her, but then heard my mom's voice saying ""Hans, is that you?"" from upstairs, the opposite direction of the shadow.  
It was at that point that I started to think that something was in the house. I was very curious about ghosts, and started asking my mom all about them. She never wanted to answer many of the questions, because she was afraid that talking about ghosts would bring them into the home.  
One day, while I was playing in the basement at around age 9 or 10, I saw my mom coming down the stairs out of the corner of my eye. I turned around to see that it wasn't my mom, but before I could make out what it was, the figure disappeared.  
I thought forever that the figure was a ghost, but my mom wouldn't ever take any of that talk and said it was my eyes playing tricks on me.  
As a teenager, I never felt comfortable in the house, I felt watched and didn't ever like to be home completely alone.  
So fast forward to present day: my parents got divorced and my mom moved into a condo about 10 minutes away. My dad lives in the same house. I'm living in my own apartment now, and was talking to my mom on the phone about those weird events from my childhood. I said I was dumb for believing in ghosts back then, but she interrupted to tell me something she'd kept from me for years: apparently she saw shadows and figures in our house all of the time, and tried to protect me from being scared of what she believed to be the spirit of the orchard owner.  
Nowadays it's not uncommon for me to stop by and visit. My sister still lives there, and I store some stuff there. One night I went over to my dad's house for dinner, and he asked me if I had ever smoked in the house. obviously I said no, because I hadn't. It's especially weird though, because if I'm ever at my dad's house alone for some reason, I can sometimes smell coffee and cigarettes.  
**TL;DR** I lived in a house that was on an old orchard's property. The orchard owner hung himself. I saw shadows, figures, my mom told me they weren't real. She now tells me she was trying to protect me and was experiencing that same thing. And I still have experiences there.",Experience ,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,d,h,True,t3_1itojm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1itojm/childhood_experiences_and_mysterious_smells/,

I arrived back last night from a long weekend away.  I was exhausted and passed right out around 9pm.  When I opened my eyes again I burst up with energy, slightly scared, with the memory of a dream I just had.  I immediately said to myself, it must be like 4:32 in the  morning.  Sure enough, it was exactly 4:32 when I looked at my cell phone and a text from my mother, which I had yet to read yet.    

I put my phone down for a second and thought about the dream I just had.  I was at my high school and my deceased great uncle was in the auditorium with me.  It was packed, but I didn't know any of the people.  My great uncle comes up to me and sits down and thanks for me for inviting him for this event.  I asked him why we were here and he said that it was just the right scenery.  He told me to tell my mom that her aunt was OK and to not worry.  I asked him what aunt and he said your great aunt - the only one that was still alive from NC.  She's moved on and that it isn't what you think it would be, but it is a new type of life.  

This is when the dream became weird, which is a usually occurrence for me.  My great uncle and I were walking in what seemed to be the back corridor of the school.  He turned into this vampire with hoofed knife arms and said he had to go.  He then whipped into this large cabinet and then Nicolas Cage, the actor, walked up in front of the cabinet and began telling me really mundane, boring stories about his life on Hollywood movie sets.  I slowly walked away and this banging came from the cabinet my vampire great-uncle was in.  I figured was getting tired of Nic Cage's stories.

So, that dream went off on a really random and ridiculous path.  BUT, as I laughed to myself I went to check my phone and finally read the text from my mom.  ""I hope you got home safe from the shore.  I just wanted to let you know that your great Aunt died.  Hope you can make it to the funeral, the rest of the family will be there!""

Weird.

Background info: Me, my girlfriend and our cat just moved together to a small apartment, one bedroom, bathroom, living room/dining room, and a kitchenette. We live on a second floor, I would describe the whole thing but it's not really important to the story so I'll just describe my bedroom since it's where all this is happening.


Our bedroom it's the last room in the apartment, it has a big closet to the right and a window facing an alley to the left, it's pained dark blue which at night makes it really dark, our bed is placed in the middle of the room.


My girlfriend works in the morning and I work second shift at a restaurant, so I'm by myself all morning, my routine includes going to the gym going back home, showering and then go to work. One day I was taking a shower when out of the corner of my eye I saw movement in the bedroom. The way the bathroom is built let's you see the bedroom when you're taking a shower (we have just a clear plastic curtain.) At first I thought it was my cat jumping to/from the bed, but when I got out my she was outside the bathroom staring at the room and moving her tail really fast. Up until now she refuses to go inside our room unless we carry her inside.


I didn't pay much attention to this so I just went with my day as usual. Everything was normal until one night something woke me up I heard little creaks and scratches inside the closet, I thought we had mice or something so the next morning I checked for holes but found nothing, I still placed some traps just in case, I kept hearing the noises but not only in the closet now they came from different places around the room. I check the traps every day and they are always empty.


Last week I woke up around 3:00 or so to the creaking and scratching, I looked around the bedroom to see what was making the noise but like I said our room it's really dark so you can just see shades, and that's exactly what I saw, two human shadows moving around my room, they would disappear and then come back, I was fucking scared I just got close to my girlfriend and hugged her, she woke up and half asleep asked me what was going on, I just told her that I was cold and wanted to cuddle. I haven't told her anything, I don't want to scare her. And ever since that night I see those shadows. And two nights ago I heard knocking on my window, I want to know what's going on, but at the same time I'm scared to find out.

1361187237.0,33,self.Paranormal,18qvgz,A paranormal experience that happened when I was in the first grade,MitchSorrenstein,39,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18qvgz/a_paranormal_experience_that_happened_when_i_was/,"I was in first grade so 6 or 7. Me and my mom were talking to this guy who was renting this home. He started showing us around the home and then the basement. When we walked down I saw butchered meat all over the place like it used to be a slaughter house. I didn't say anything because my mom and the dude didn't say anything about it. Years later I finally tell her what I saw and she told me she just saw a regular basement. He told my mom it used to be a full basement but they walled off 3/4 of it. I forget the reason he told my mom.
My mom ended up renting the house and sometime later saw a loose brick in the wall and she told me it looked like it had furniture in it but had sheets over it. We both thought it was odd that if they were to seal a room up why would they leave furniture in it.

Months later my mom marries my now ex step-dad and odd things started happening.
My brother has never slept walk in his life, but at that house I would wake up and see my brother standing up and just staring at me in the middle of the night. It scared the hell out of me because I was in the first grade and he didn't look like my brother from my perception. He started doing this often.
Strange things started piling up. I didn't find out a lot of the strange things because my mom and brother and sister didn't want to freak me out.
She told me about how in the middle of the night she would hear dishes and pots and pans in the kitchen being moved loudly and would investigate and see nothing.
Another time a handyman was supposed to come over and fix the stove. Not a cooking stove but a heater. So she hears a ton of noise like people fucking around with pipes. She assumes it's the guy but then the guy knocks on the door and he isn't dirty so it couldn't of been him.
She told me once in the middle of the night she work up to hearing someone laugh in an evil voice and then look at a portrait above her bed and see red eyes on it.
One time she told me she went some where and when she came back to the house from going some where the window curtain was open and the string that you had to pull was pulled to it's maximum length and it was pointed to the basement.

My brother and sister told me that one time my parents were away at a store or something and they were doing dishes. I was sleeping, I think as I don't remember it. They suddenly see this man staring at them from the kitchen window. My sister got scared and my brother went to investigate as my parents were pulling up. Needless to say they didn't find anyone.
I'm sure there are more stories but the last one I remember because I was there. My mom was walking up the cement steps to the front door (it was only like 3-4 steps) and she fell backwards hard and was hurt and was bleeding from her legs. She said later it felt like someone pulled the legs out from under her. She goes to the doctor and finds out, because of that fall that she had a miscarriage (she never knew she was pregnant at the time to begin with).
After that happened things returned to normal and the weird things stopped happening and we moved. She said she asked the new people who moved in if anything weird happened and they said no.

I'd be curious as this happened about 31 years ago so I wonder if there is some database of haunted properties to see if anyone else experienced anything bizarre since then or how to look up the history of a house/property.

Something that I couldn't see not only knocked me down but decided to talk to me too. I’m still kind of freaking out but I needed to write it out before I forgot anything. Please pardon any grammatical errors.

I was walking home from school tonight and I have to walk through this tunnel underneath this set of train tracks. It’s pretty creepy but I’m used to it by now since I walk through it every day. Anyway so I’m walking and ordinarily I don’t really see anyone else going through there, but I heard footsteps behind me. Not entirely unheard of. The footsteps get louder though and like they’re getting faster and I start to get a little paranoid.

Then as I was passing by the space between the two train tracks (which is a really creepy overgrown, weedy looking alley type thing that I make sure to never look in at night), I hear a voice that sounds like it is right next to me. Like, it whispered right in my ear. I don’t even know what it said but I felt breath. It legit scared me so freaking much, I couldn't even breathe. So I’m standing there like an idiot completely unable to move feeling like my heart is going to burst from my chest. I’m scared to even look around to see who it could have possibly been but it was right in my ear I would have seen them, but there was absolutely no one. So I stand there a little bit waiting for something else to happen but nothing ever does so I take a step forward and then something physically hits me. It was like a really hard gust of wind except it was like, solid and it hit me in the neck/chest so hard I fell back on my ass.

I’m not kidding I sat there for probably a good 15 minutes hiding my face in my coat before I could even make myself crawl away and then finally get up and run home.

Sorry this isn’t eloquent or anything but I think you understand lol. I’ve had weird experiences in houses and stuff but never anything like this. Seriously, my roommates think I’m a crazy person right now.

I jump out of bed, run to this window and see nothing. So I sit with him and wait to see If it happends again. 10mins later I hear a few taps, I fly to the window phone in hand ready to take a picture of the pervy bastard and no ones is out there. My son starts screaming ""Do you see  him he is right there.""  After we pray and I calm him I asked him to decribe the man. He said "" I couldn't see his face. He was dark, all black mami from head to toe. Very tall but I could kinda see thru him"" 
What was it? 
I'll be praying in his room Every night from now on.




Update:  We had a few interesting things Happen. 

Two nights after this situation, I was walking by my son's room and saw a shadow outside thier window. Impossible because we are on a risen first floor, I wouldn't be able to see the top of a persons head. It was gone so quick I said I was just seeing things. 

This weekend I went to see a friend and was sitting in her kitchen and saw a shadow pass her windows on the sides of her door. We were expecting another friend so I opened the door and no ones was there.

I believe something attached itself to me. I took my family to get prayed over, annointed my home in oil, and firmly told whatever it was It's not welcomed here. I even annoited my windows and doors. I have had other situations like this when I was younger. I think I am good now, better than I thought. I feel like I have more energy and I am happier. Apparently this thing was around longer than I knew.

So my girlfriend was breaking up with me and I had a panic attack and passed out and when I came to the entire apartment was dark. As it turns out the entire apartment building's circuits were blown. Also turns out that my roommate's subwoofer is blown as well as anything that wasn't plugged into a surge protector. You'd think it was a coincidence, but stuff like this happens all the time around me.

Sometimes lights will literally burn out as I walk under them, especially if I'm upset. My parents noticed it and teased me lovingly about it growing up.

Constantly, street lights go out when I go under them. Yeah, I know the controversy around this, but even my girlfriend had noticed that it happens way too much to be coincidence around me, because it almost never happens when she's alone. Some of my other friends notice the same thing. Even my parents noticed this too and acknowledge that it's really weird.

Also, while this might not be connected, but sometimes I'll have dejavu in which if I'm fast enough I'll be able to name things that haven't happened yet. And then sometimes, for inexplicable reasons, when I'm depressed or in need of help, like clockwork a friend I haven't talked to will come from out of the blue and call me or text me.

So last time I posted the banging on the wall had just happened. That was absolutely terrifying. I started to feel uncomfortable in the shower, if I washed my face and would have to close my eyes I would be terrified that when I opened them the face from outside the window would be looking at me. I started to shower with the shower curtain open even though that would mean the entire bathroom floor would get soaked. I was too scared of the unknown.

The voices at night got worse, sometimes angry, sometimes urgent, sometimes terrified. Always the same guy in his mid to late thirties screaming my name though. He never said anything else.
At a party one night I knocked a bottle of perfume out my window and it shattered everywhere on the concrete below my room. We had a gardener who would clean up accidents like that so I didn't bother sweeping the glass up.

About a week after I dropped the glass I woke up suddenly during the night. This was not uncommon as I had insomnia. I looked at the clock. Three A.M. Witching hour. I turned over and tried to get back to sleep. Then I heard footsteps. I was used to the sound of the soft padded footsteps that I would often hear in my room. These footsteps sounded like heavy workbooks coming from outside my room, along the concrete below my window. I heard pacing for a few seconds, then the unmistakable sound of glass crunching under heavy boots. The glass perfume bottle I had accidentally dropped from my window a week prior. The crunching footsteps continued for a while as if someone was walking back and forth outside my window. Then they stop. Silence for a minute or two. At this point I was utterly terrified. Too terrified of what I would see if I were to pull back my curtain and face whatever was out there. Then the scratching started. Barely noticeable at first, but then louder. The sound of fingernails on glass. The sound of something scratching to get in.

The scratching eventually stopped, and the sound of crunching glass underfoot began again, until it eventually faded away. I thought, thank god, I am safe. That feeling did not last long. It was about ten minutes before the footsteps resumed, then the crunching glass, then the scratching. I was petrified, too scared to leave my bed to go and get one of my flatmates. Eventually it stopped altogether, and I fell asleep.

The next morning my flatmate came into my room, and what she said chilled me to my bones. She said ""vic, last night there was someone outside my room. I would hear their footsteps outside for a while, then they started scratching on my window. After about ten minutes they would leave, and in ten minutes they were back again"". Someone, or something, has been outside my room, and then would go to my flatmates room (which was the next room from mine) and then would come back to my room. I pulled my curtains open, to check if the glass had been trampled, and there was a handprint on the outside of the window. The glass was completely gone.
Not long after that Marina was in her room, getting ready for bed, while the rest of the household (Gabriel and his boyfriend, Luke, and I, Jarryd and Dion had left at this point). We heard a blood curdling scream, and her screaming in tears for us to please come into her room. We all ran in and she was sitting up against the closet, hysterical. We asked her what was wrong. She pointed to the window opposite her, the second window of two that she had in her room. The window that was about two metres off the ground from the inside. The window that would have been at least three metres off the ground from the outside. The window that someone from the outside could not have possibly reached.

There was a fresh hand-print on the window.

Luke immediately went outside to investigate. There was no one outside, no sounds. He came back inside to investigate the hand print. He rubbed his finger along it. It smudged. The hand print had been made from inside the house. It was the hand-print not of a nineteen year old girl, but of a full-grown man.

Are there others like me?",Devistator,39,6,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/jj6ma/im_agnostic_but_have_a_huge_interest_in/,"To elaborate, I'm an Agnostic who is borderline Atheist. By that I mean I don't actually believe in a higher force, but that I don't discount the possibility that there is such a force. I'm very much interested in paranormal activity, but on a scientific basis. In the case of what I've seen, heard, and felt... I want to explore all possibilities, while finding some scientific explanation to why. I'd also like to add that I was into paranormal activity long before all of the shows started appearing on TV. 

Also, I've posted similar threads in both r/AskReddit and r/Atheism saying I'm more of a skeptic that wants to find scientific explanations for myself rather than prove to anyone that such and such exists. They ignored the whole scientific skepticism and went straight to the ""Ghosts don't exist... downvote for you."" This is even though I never said they existed or not, but rather explained some instances where I could not debunk what I witness. I also pointed out that I completely understand skepticism or personal explanations for those not there when it happened were welcome, and that I am also skeptical of other people's stories. That went on deaf ears.

Here is one of the oddities I had encountered:

One of my friends bought and completely renovated a house from an elderly woman (or couple, I don't know). I don't know if they died there or not. During the renovation, my friend and others had numerous paranormal events happen. The most common one was when walking through the house, people were either poked or pinched on the shoulders. At one time, two of my friends (the only ones in the house) heard tools tools being shaken in the basement when renovating. They came down to find no one there. All of the doors and windows were locked.

Well, we threw many drunken parties in his newly renovated house as well as bonfires outside. Some people said they had been poked or touched. I actually witnessed my cousin walking through the crowded kitchen stop... say ""huh?"", and look behind him. He though someone was trying to get his attention by tapping on his right shoulder. No one was around him within the radius of 4 feet. 

What happened to me was also in the kitchen along the open path others have felt something. To give a visual, it's a large, open kitchen. Nothing comes in contact with you, nor are there any air vents or windows that could push a breeze to that point. 

One day during a bonfire, I had my own little encounter. Everyone was outside, with the exception of one guy in the bathroom taking a piss with the door closed and probably was locked. I was alone in the kitchen washing my hands off after I spilled some beer on them. All the windows were closed, the AC wasn't on. I proceeded to walk out from the kitchen to the door leading to the deck when what I thought was a cicada hit me in the top/back of my head. We have cicadas like crazy here in the midwest. I slapped around my head saying, ""What the fuck?"" trying to find out what hit me. I looked around for a bug only to find nothing. It was silent in the kitchen. No fans, no heat/AC, no windows open.

Let me explain the feeling in detail, so you can see what I mean: Take a hand (either one), and curl your 4 fingers in and leave your thumb out. Now take that hand, hold it close to the top of the back of your head and flick the 4 fingers upward across your hair/skull.

This is what I felt. Well, not just felt, but heard. Just the same way that you can hear the scratching when you scratch your head. This is why I though I was a cicada given the size of the insect, but there was nothing around me. A draft or blow of air couldn't have caused this same sensation. 

----

That is the most unexplainable paranormal experience I've had. I've had others, but nothing like a touch. Again going back to my lack of religious beliefs and overall intrigue and skepticism, I want to find a scientific explanation for it. I'm interested in the theories of parallel dimensions/universes. I am extremely skeptical of everything I come across. I only rely on what I have personally experienced, and am skeptical of the stories of others as I would understand they would be to mine.

This happened last fall with a very good friend of mine. In SE Portland there is a very old pioneer cemetery known as Lone Fir. It's very spooky, tons of graves and crypts from the late 1800's. It was around 11:30 at night and me and my friend were waiting to meet with another friend around the corner. He was running late so to kill time we decided to hop the fence and explore the cemetery. We were walking along the road inside and noticed a figure standing still about 50 yards ahead of us. Thinking it was someone trying to scare us I yelled ""what up"". No reply. So we kept walking towards it attempting to play along with this persons joke. When we finally got within 20 feet the person went completely catatonic and violently jerked there head up towards the sky. At this point me and my friend were a little taken back. However I still couldn't see the persons face or clothes because it was so dark (the cemetery is covered with old growth trees). I walked closer until I could make out the face of a old man with a longer beard. He was wearing a white shirt and black pants. He was still staring up at the sky until I said ""hello"". He let out a bloodcurdling yell and jerked his head violently in the direction of my friend and I. His eyes were completely blank looking and he just stared, then yelled again. After that me and my friend booked it out of the cemetery. We had no idea what we saw. We were freaking out. However I have always had interest in the paranormal so we immediately went back to see if it was some homeless guy on PCP. We scanned through the cemetery and not a single person was there. My friend was so terrified he refuses to talk about what happened to this day.

This took place around 2002 because my parents split in 2004.

My father has a green house in the backyard and one day my mother was watering the plants and whatnot and had a bizarre encounter.. 
My dad had put a plastic lining around the green house to help trap in some heat, and you could see through it, but it was pretty blurry.. 
Either way, there was an old couple who lived next door to us and the elderly wife would usually come over and help my mom garden because she enjoyed gardening, and the company.
So, Mom was doing her thing and she said she looked up and saw who she thought was Mrs.Horwood, (the elderly lady), outside of the green house kind of looking in at her through the plastic. My mom was like ""Hello Mrs.Horwood, how are you doing? Come in the green house, ect..ect.."", but apparently the woman just.. stood there.. staring at her.
My mom got kind of freaked out and also worried, thinking it was still our neighbour. SOOO after a few seconds my mom asked what was wrong with her and the ""woman'' looking in at my mom just turned away and walked behind the greenhouse. 
(Behind the greenhouse was a small path leading to our neighbours yard, and then behind that, all forest... for miles, and miles.)
Mom left the greenhouse to go catch up to ""Mrs.Horwood"" because she was concerned. Not seeing anyone, she went into Mrs.Horwood's house and there she was, sitting at the table with her family and husband..

It may not be as accurate as it was back when it first happened, but that night (february 15, 2009, to be exact) was one of the few times that I've ever encountered something bizarre or as 'ghostly' as this.

It started out with me and a couple friends deciding to get some snacks and head to my house to watch the NBA All-Star game which we couldn't watch at my friend A's house because his TV was being used by his mom, who wouldn't let us watch it. So my house and A's house are very close, about 7 minutes walking distance, and between my house and his house was the gas station where we got snacks. After buying the snacks, we began heading up the sidewalk towards my place. That's where shit got weird.

Right after leaving the gas station parking lot, the temperature dropped at least 10 degrees and the winds picked up. This isn't that strange for winter here, but everything also seemed to get really quiet besides the wind. There were absolutely no people or cars outside at the time. Not that unusual for a sunday night here, but still really creepy. As soon as we passed a headstone shop we saw a figure of a man heading towards us on the sidewalk. He appeared to be hastily jogging towards us, and as we got closer, we saw what he was wearing and it was out of place. The man was dressed in a 50's style brown suit and had a briefcase and a cane, with slicked back white hair and a beard like the dos equis guy. We said hello to him as he passed, but he apparently didn't even notice us and kept on walking as fast as before. 

We all agreed that he didn't really seem human in some way, as if he just sort of exuded some mystical quality, as dumb as that may sound haha. After he had passed us and we let a few seconds pass, we all looked back to see what the fuck had just happened and he was gone. Not far away, not in a house, just completely gone.

1352831826.0,29,self.Paranormal,134uaf,At what point does an unexplained experience demand a paranormal explanation? What is your standard of evidence before attributing an event to a supernatural source?,ofthe5thkind,45,16,51,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/134uaf/at_what_point_does_an_unexplained_experience/,"Whenever I browse this subreddit, these two questions go through my mind more than any other:

**At what point does an unexplained experience demand a paranormal explanation?**

One of the most common openings to experiences recounted here in /r/Paranormal is ""When I was a child..."" The problem is that [adult recollections of childhood experiences are about as accurate as chance](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2000/06/000602073735.htm). Because we know this, is it dishonest to use a childhood experience as evidence of a paranormal experience?

Perhaps you've experienced a series of extremely unlikely coincidences related, in some way, to a dead loved one. Whether it's our brains' insistence on creating patterns out of random data (see: [apophenia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia), the [Baader-Meinhoff phenomenon](http://www.damninteresting.com/the-baader-meinhof-phenomenon/), [this article on ""patternicity,""](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=patternicity-finding-meaningful-patterns) and [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/tq3rh/addressing_the_most_common_paranormal_claims/)), or whether it's a matter of statistics (see: [Black Swan theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory) and the [Law Of Large Numbers](http://www.probabilitytheory.info/content/item/6-the-law-of-large-numbers-/-the-law-of-averages)), we do know that unlikely things happen *all the time*.

Maybe you've taken audio, video, or photographic evidence of something unexplained. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem that there's [any way it can be considered evidence](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/tcyzi/considering_how_easy_it_is_to_fake/), as all three forms of media are too prone to defect and hoax to consider empiricism. Maybe you've seen something unexplained with your own two eyes, but [optical illusions](http://bigthink.com/artful-choice/do-my-eyes-deceive-me-optical-illusions-framing-and-choice) have shown us just a sliver of our brains' annoying ability to [deceive us](http://blog.brainiyak.com/?p=2151) via things like suggestive intuition and imaginative eyewitness testimony, not to mention the previously-mentioned problems with [the accuracy of our memories](http://www.skepdic.com/essays/teachingCT.html):

""*...neither sense perception nor memory work like video or audio recorders. We construct our perceptions and memories out of bits of data that have been filtered, organized, and completed by our brains. The process is heavily affected by our worldviews, our interests, expectations, and purposes. We’re not truth-seeking machines by nature...*""

Or, as Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman famously said about making honest observations, [""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself - and you are the easiest person to fool.""](http://www.lhup.edu/~DSIMANEK/cargocul.htm)

**What is your standard of evidence before attributing an event to a supernatural source?**

As we all know, Carl Sagan once said that [extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/stpoa/carl_sagan_said_extraordinary_claims_require/). This is often countered by the old Sherlock Holmes quip: ""When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth."" Those who use this as a reply, I think, aren't truly grasping just *how extraordinary* a paranormal claim is, and so it is much easier to resort to a paranormal explanation in order to explain something that they cannot explain. This is evident when looking at polls of paranormal beliefs. [This one, from 2005, shows that 73% of Americans believe](http://www.gallup.com/poll/16915/three-four-americans-believe-paranormal.aspx). This means that roughly three out of four Americans, with only subjective experience to offer as support, were comfortable making extraordinary claims 7 years ago.

I wonder, sometimes, just how widespread of a misunderstanding it is that ""knowledge"" and ""belief"" are the same thing. They are very different. Belief demands nothing of you other than belief itself, but knowing something... that takes rigor, study, patience, repeated experiment, revision when evidence demands it, care, a constant openness to critique. I've seen many people in /r/Paranormal say that they ""*know*"" that ghosts / spirits / demons / astral projection / ouija boards / etc. are ""real,"" but this is an incorrect use of ""know."" This isn't knowing. It's believing, and beliefs do not dictate what is real.

But beliefs are strong, and thanks to [cognitive dissonance](http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html), they are exceptionally good at protecting our established worldviews from evidence that would demand that the worldview changes. You can explain the [Ideomotor effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideomotor_phenomenon) to someone who believes that the Ouija board is a legitimate portal to another realm until your face turns blue. They will still believe. You can suggest that they try using an Ouija board with a blindfold on to see if the planchette can successfully spell anything at all, in an attempt to show them that the Ouija requires thinking, observing, cooperative humans in order to ""work,"" but it won't make a difference. If someone wants to believe something badly enough, evidence is often considered irrelevant, wrong, or part of a conspiracy. [This article](http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2010/07/11/how_facts_backfire/), titled ""How Facts Backfire,"" explains this phenomenon very well.

Usually, we are then reduced to statements like: ""If you aren't open to paranormal activity, then you'll be spiritually blocked off from experiencing it."" This is essentially no different than proclaiming ""It isn't real unless you believe."" Again, we're back to a core problem -- beliefs do not appear to dictate reality. If they did, the Earth would be [flat for these people](http://theflatearthsociety.org/cms/), and [located at the center of the solar system for these people](http://www.galileowaswrong.com/galileowaswrong/). Beliefs, as best as we can tell, cannot change the shape or location of an entire planet, and just the same, they cannot be presented as evidence for the paranormal.

**TL;DR**

The dorm that I lived in was called Babcock, named after Mary Renolds Babcock, who I don't know vey much about, but died rather young. During the first week there we began to hear stories about the dorm being haunted. Right as you enter the dorm there is a large painting of Ms. Babcock, and the story was that if you politely said hello to her when you walked in that her ghost would not bother you. So we all did it kind of as a running joke, at the time I was very skeptical about matters of the paranormal. Strange things indeed happened however. At night you could hear footsteps on the floor above you at different times in the night, but this was to be expected living on the second floor of a three story dorm, however the students on the third floor heard the steps as well. About a week after we got there one of the students decided to yell profanity at the picture and mooned it. One hour later while walking down the stairs, he fell for no apparent reason and sustained one of the worst leg breaks that I have eve witnessed personally. My own experience came about a week or so later in the middle of the night. We always left the doors to our rooms open because the dorm had no AC and is was cooler with the doors open. I woke up in he middle of the night to use the bathroom, and as I sat up in bed I noticed a figure moving past the door. I saw it as it had almost passed the door, and all I saw was the back and tail of a long dress, very old timey looking. I stepped into the hallway to investigate but saw nothing. I did howeve feel a vey cold breeze which was unusual because usually it was so hot it was tough to sleep. Take my story for what you will, but it is true.

The thing is, I created the original, and im reposting here because r/nosleep just trolled me. Plus, I believe its more fitting in a paranormal community rather than ""spooky story"" because this legit happened to me and my family. We've never really told anyone, I've told maybe 3 people in my life.

When I was a kid, I didn't have friends. I had brothers and cousins. We spent all of our time roaming the woods. We lived in a fairly secluded hollow in a southern state, so the majority of our time was spent running through the woods, swinging on vines and shit. Real country boy activities. I remember only bits and pieces of this, because I was 3-4 when it started, but what I clearly remember is waking up one night to the sound of my own voice. I thought ""I'm not talking?!?"" and then I looked in the corner of the room. There I saw a little boy, my size, huddled in the corner rubbing his arms as if he were cold. I don't believe I said anything, but he looked over at me, ran towards the window, and leaped through it. Now, You would expect the glass to shatter and it be this loud bang, but nothing happened. I began to get scared and started crying and screaming. My mom runs up the stairs to check on me. Turns out I just had a ""bad dream."" or atleast that what she came too. Well, for the next few days, I felt like someone was following me, and I kept catching this little motherfucker peeking at me from behind walls and shit. Those are the memories I have at that house, because shortly after I told my mom what all was happening, we fucking dipped out and moved. Apparently, I had been told several strange things by this ""little kid"" and I would go tell my mom. Things like ""Tomorrow a snake is going to crawl in the cabinet, you need to close the hole up."" My mom would laugh it off, and sure as shit a snake would be in there the next day. She told me later in life the reason we moved is she woke up in the middle of the night to me sitting on the couch talking plainly to someone who wasnt there. I dont remember it, but she said I just kept saying ""I'll be your friend if you leave them alone. I love them. Don't bother them."" and when she said something to me, I turned my head... stared directly at her.. and smiled. She told me that when I smiled, she heard ,as she put it, a ""god awful"" roar that shook the room, then a blast of air hit her, knocked her down. She said the worst part was when I jumped off the couch and screamed ""YOU PROMISED YOU WOULDNT DO THAT. YOU NEED TO GO AWAY... GO AWAY BAD MAN... GO AWAY"" Remember, This part I have no memory of, and I to the day remain skeptical of this shit... but it keeps going... My mom apparently had some big deal where she went into my room and strongly told whatever it was that it wasnt welcome and had to go........ She never told me what happened next, but a week later we had a new home. I liked this home. It had a bunch of race cars and shit on the wall... a real knock out place for a 4-5 year old kid. Everything returned to normal. My brother went to live with our biological mother (I lived with my grandparents.. they adopted me because my mother said she didnt want me... they saved me from abortion) so it was just me in the home with my mom and dad. I had started a preschool literally a quarter of a mile from my home because my mom started working to help pay for our new home. Then... shit got wierd again. I was a preschool one day when a teacher called my mom going bat shit crazy... Apparently I told the woman that ""Susie said she loved you, and that her shoes that she loved were lost in the water."" That might not seem like much, but susie was her sister who was kidnapped raped and dumped into the river. That lady never got onto me or anything after that... She always would stare me down and make me nap alone... Then the shit started happening at home. This time, my parents thought it was just a kid having and imaginary friend. This is were shit gets strange for me, because I can remember most of this. I'll indicate when i cant. I was 5, and had been preoccupied with my imaginary friend Uncle Daniel. My mom thought I was terrible at giving imaginary names, and that being my name is Daniel, I just projected it from my imagination. Anywho, I had become best buds with Uncle Daniel. I can never remember seeing what uncle daniel looked like, but I remember the voice. I would play with toys in my toyroom, and that homie was right beside me! Cowboys and indians and shit ya know? Then one day, he told me to go tell me mom that when we went to the beach next week, that we needed to take the VCR (kids, this was before DVD) because the television was broke and if we wanted to watch anything, we would need it. She laughed it off and just went on with business as usual. This hadn't been the first time Uncle Daniel had told me to tell her things... Usually I wouldnt and he would be angry with me. This time I did, and when we went into our condo at the beach, My mom turned pale. -I dont remember this part I am about to tell you, this is from my mothers mouth.- She grabbed and started shaking me saying ""Who told you that... who told you that"" she said I went completely blank faced and said to her ""MARY (moms Name) TAKE YOU HANDS OFF OF THE BOY"" and pushed her back with force. She said she started crying, and we left the beach after being there only 3-4 hours. She told me she couldnt look at me. We went home. My mom was wierd around me for the next couple of days. She wouldnt really look at me when talking to me, and had been calling about getting me evaluated by therapists (sp.) She said she didnt even have the chance to set up an appointment before things went CRAY CRAY. She said she woke up one night, and there I was on the couch again, talking just plain as day to someone she couldnt see. -No memory of this- she said she was apprehensive about saying anything to me, but she listened for a while. I was argueing with my imaginary friend Uncle Daniel. Apparently, he and I didnt see eye to eye with something he was gonna do, and I was basically breaking up with him. She said I told him I didnt want to see him anymore, and that he needed to go back. She said she had no idea what I meant by go back, but I stood up on my feet and started screaming ""GO BACK GO BACK GO BACK"" and thats when 2 pictures fell off the all, she heard HEAVY footsteps in the kitchen, and the door opened by itself. She said she spent the next 30 mins crying until I walked up to her and told her it was ok, and he was gone and she shouldnt be sad anymore. Wierd right? Well, He didnt go away. I remember this clearly, i was laying in bed with my dad one night because he had been particularly nasty to me that day and I didnt want to be alone... I all the sudden felt something tugging on my shirt, and when I turned, nothing was there. The bed we were in was up against the all, so there was a tiny crack between the wall and bed. I felt fingers... I to the day can remember each finger grabbing my side and pulling my shirt under the bed. I started screaming.. my dad hops up and asks me whats wrong... I tell him, and he instantly drops to the floor and looks under the bed... Nothing. At this point, my mom burst in from the other room and is freaking out. Now, This part gives me chillbumps still, and I'll try to explain completely. My parents have different versions of what happened, but ill give both. My dad, A non religious man who just believed I was being a kid, said to me later in life that he was looking at me, but suddenly I didnt look like myself anymore. I had changed and he couldnt figure it out. He said he asked me ""Are you ok."" and thats when I supposedly told him ""The boy is my friend. I'm not going to hurt him."" My dad said that it was in such a creepy voice that he fucking booked it out of the room. Each door he would go to would shut in front of him as if someone was slamming them shut. Then he said it just got calm again. He said he didnt sleep that night, but shrugged it off the next day after talking to co workers. My moms version of the story is different. She said that she felt someone holding her hand, and when she looked, I was standing beside her, but I was also on the bed. She said that the ""version"" of me on the bed looked contorted. She said she had an overwelming sense that things were ok, and that she looked at the ""Version"" on me holding her hand and said ""Please, He is a good boy, just leave him alone. You are scaring him all the time now."" She said that somehow, The me on the bed looked normal, and the thing holding her hand howled and dissappeared. When I woke up the next day, Uncle Daniel was gone... And I didnt see him again until a few years later. The next couple of years were simple... I didnt have any sort of scary shit happen other than watching scary movies and being afraid of the dark. The next couple of weird things are actually comforting to me. My sister passed away when i was 8 years old. My mom had received a call from a Colordo police department and she was on the toilet seat crying (no she wasnt shitting or pissing.. she just broke down and had been folding towels) She said she walking in my room to wake me up, but say me sitting on the bed talking to someone. She tells me that I was giggling and saying ""So I wont see you again? Sissy dont go?"" I believe you should know, I called my sister sissy. My mom said she saw an impression on the bed next to me that lifted when she came in... She broke down. I apparently kept telling her ""But no, sissy is here. Sissy is here"" Weird I know. but this HAPPENED. I turn 10. A few months later my grandfather and grandmother pass away. It was about 3 months apart. I had a dream they were on their couch. They told me to tell everyone they were ok... So I did... this oddly brought peace to my entire family... but I was just a kid. So, remember Uncle Daniel? Well, I am 10 years old and my family decides to go on a road trip to las vegas... its a long ass drive, and it took us three days. One night, We were in Arizona and the while we were asleep, the water faucent turned on in the bathroom. I went and turned it off being the only one awake. I lay down... it cuts back on. I walk in there, and cut it off again, irriated because I was tired. (I rememeber all of this) I went to go lay back down, And there was Uncle Daniel, sitting in a chair next to our bed. I SCREAMED, and my mom woke up. She said I was shaking, and she knew what I had seen. she said some shit like ""Begone foul spirit... i told you to leave him alone"" or something like that and he just disappeared... We left immediately.

So, Thats pretty much sums up my story. I know there it will be met with a lot of reddit skeptisim, but I promise you, these things happened. I never had any experiences after this other than things you can chaulk up to coincidence (basically being able to call when someone was going to get hurt, something would go wrong, or an accident would happen) I have never told any of my friends, they all wouldnt believe me anyhow. I did tell 2 different girlfriends that were pretty serious, and my mother backed me up. They somehow felt closer to me after hearing these stories. I would expect that they would turn tail and run. Anyhow, I guess the reason I am posting this is to see if anyone has had similar experiences, Or maybe when they were a child this happened. I'm not some freak of nature, and I'm a normal contributing member of society. Still, sometimes when I dream, Im talking to people I shouldnt be...

It wasn't until age 17 I realized I'd had my fair share of ""paranormal"" experiences. After this realization I'm not sure if the reoccurring events are slightly influenced by paranoia or poor ""debunking."" Slowly the incidents became more and more difficult to explain and made their way in to my personal life.

Here's a quick summary of what I've experienced.

At 16 I was playing xbox home alone when I heard various bangs it the bathroom adjacent to the room I was in. I knew I was alone and walked to the bathroom with my fists up, assuming someone had broken into the house. A small picture frame from above the toilet had been thrown onto the floor. (This had never happened before, and has yet to happen again.)

Same year, home alone and playing video games again, I heard a violent ""bang"" sound right behind my head. I jumped and turned around to notice the window behind me had cracked from the top right corner to the bottom left, and only on the inside of the two window panes. My father blamed me later, saying that I ""threw the controller at the window,"" which wouldn't make sense because the crack was a clean and fairly straight line, not ring shaped as I assume it would be from an impact.

Same year, After using a Ouija board at a cemetery with friends (PLEASE NEVER USE ONE) A friend and I kept hearing footsteps from the bushes so we went to go check it out. After finding nothing, we went back to the table where the board sat and I continued to look at the bushes where the sounds came from. I saw a white mist appear in front of the bush line and walk in a familiar bipedal way before quickly disappearing. I screamed and pointed after my brain determined that there was no way what I saw was at all possible. No one else saw.

By 18 I'd had my fair share of strange experiences (more than those above), but most notably, on reoccurring occasions, my bed would shake when attempting to fall asleep. Not only that, but on occasion I'd wake up in the middle of the night with a sort of a 6th sense that someone was in the room with me. I never physically saw anything, and can't explain how I've seen what I've seen, but I'm come to determine that on these nights, a middle age women with blonde hair(maybe 35 or 40), is in the room. This happened on multiple occasions and I never really felt threatened, so I learned to live with it and didn't really talk about it with anyone.

I went to college, and quickly learned that my roommate was very open and would understand anything I told him about my personal life. After two weeks, I told him these stories and apologized should anything affect the room we shared. He shook it off and didn't mind for the time being.

About half way through the year, I woke up in the middle of the night with my head next to the door. Attached to the door was our metal towel rack. At about 4 am, the rack shook on occasion, making banging sounds against the wood door. It became more violent over about a 30 second period and I could physically watch the rack (about 5 feet from me) move back and forth, separating itself from the door. In the morning I checked to see if you could move the rack from the outside, and it was impossible. I didn't mention it to my roommate, but later the next day he asked if I too saw the rack move in the previous night. This happened on 2 occasions during the school year.

I've had more similar experiences, and fail to explain the majority of them. Like I said before, the worst of these experiences is knowing that someone is in the room with you. I can't actually see anything, but I have woken up to the woman laying next to me. It's like my eyes at the time had a filter between what was ""actually"" there, and not.

I've come to live with the fact that sometimes, this woman is in the room with me, and luckily it hasn't affected my life negatively.

Excuse more poor explanations, but hopefully someone else has similar experiences or can help me explain ""seeing"" the same thing I do.

Cheers

I was born in Tuscon, AZ then moved to Mesa, AZ shortly after. My family had bought a one story house (Alicia) then when I was 10 we moved to a two story house (Naranja). Although we moved out of Alicia we still kept the house, but we rented it out. 

**At the Naranja house**

A few months after moving into the Naranja house, I was watching T.V. downstairs in the living room. After about an hour I drifted asleep, but only to wake up around 2 in the morning. Back then I used to never wake up that early, so it gave me a weird vibe. I glanced up to the loft, which was visible from the couch, and saw a dark figure. I instantly covered myself with the blanket I was using. A couple of minutes later I slowly looked for the figure, and it was still there. After I woke up the next morning I ran upstairs to see if anything in the loft could create the figure, but nothing stood tall enough for it. 

A couple weeks after I was sleeping in my room upstairs, and I woke up in the middle of the night again. My throat was extremely dry, so I started to head down stairs. While stepping off my bed, a hand gripped around my ankle. I instantly ran down the stairs screaming, and waking up my parents. After they calmed me down I told them what happened and my dad took the bat in his room and ran upstairs looking for an invader of some sort. Yet no one was in my room. 

(In the billiards room by the front door of the house there was a little figurine of a man holding up a sign. It was pretty creepy.) One night I fell asleep on the same part of the couch that I saw the figure from, and I yet again wake up in the middle of the night. As I look down I see the figurine from the billiards room standing in front of me at the end of the couch. I proceeded to run upstairs into my room.

*After a few years of living in the Naranja house we moved back into the Alicia house*

**At the Alicia house**

A couple months after moving back into the house, I laid down in my bed. As I started to drift asleep, I felt a large pressure on my chest. Almost as if someone was trying to push me further into my bed. I was alone in the house. 

**At my friends house**

Down the street from the Alicia house, was my friend Billy's house. I would always head over there and we'd play videogames all night long. 

While on these all nighters, Billy and I would always hear noises. Not only that, but we would feel a presence at the end of the hallway. 

One day we were heading out to Fudrucker's with Billy's dad, and we started discussing the presence. I started to describe what I thought the presence would look like, then Billy finished my sentence with what I was going to say. We both described the same features to each other without previously talking about it. 

We came up to the full description of a short old woman, with a black dress and a black vial over her face. The woman was also pale with black eyes. 

**TL;DR I've had shadow people stare at me while sleeping, a hand grab my ankle, I woke up and a figurine was staring me down, been pushed into my bed, and my friend and I described the same presence without previously talking about it.**",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1ffz7l,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ffz7l/paranormal_experiences/,

She started to walk around with her phone out and took a picture of the convex mirror to see what or who was there. In the picture in the lower left hand corner she saw what she believes to be a face in the one of the back rows of the shop. She went around back and found nothing.

I'm interested in what others think of the photo. Our family friend believes she saw a ghost but I'm not one to jump to any conclusion. I'm skeptical but the picture is interesting. I imagine there may have been something there that made the face IE: Pareidolia.

When I was a kid, I was staying with a friend who lived way out in the backwoods, at the extreme end of a valley. Neighbours were like three or four miles apart. The area had once housed a reasonable size farming community that had been decimated by a flood. The community never recovered due to the long term loss of viable road access. As a result the area has these weird patches of cleared field in the middle of the rainforest, kind of dotted about at random. We went of playing in the hills one afternoon. We came across this house in a very remote location. It was modern, brick, huge and surrounded by a perfectly manicured lawn and pampus grass. We turned back thinking we had just wandered onto someone property. We told my friend’s parents about it when we got home and they were shocked and a bit confused. There were/are no houses locally like it and only then did we realise it was miles from any kind of road. We went out the next day to try and find it again but could not.

Small house, 3 bedroom (can't count the last bedroom as it is like a broom cupboard). Any who, since I was a child, I have noticed some screwed up stuff. This post is basically me just venting all this fucked up stuff that has happened since my parents refuse to believe it.

So it started when I was around 4 years old. It wasn't even in my house, it was at King Henry VIII's castle in Wales (I think?). My dad was taking me around the ruins with my baby brother. There, in the courtyard where there was a pillar, I kept seeing a family of 5 dressed in big, heavy clothes. It was only shadows. I kept asking my dad ""who is that daddy"" and he thought I was imagining things. The feeling of them got so distressful I burst out crying and my dad had to literally carry me out of the place. I had no fucking idea who King Henry the VIII was then, let alone he has a family of 5 and wore ridiculous clothing. Since then, things in my house have been weird.

I think the creepiest time in my house ever is when it's dark, around 3am. I'm writing this at 00:30 so I'm very soon going to hide under duvet and hope for the best. When I was around 5, I woke up in the middle of the night. I looked at the end of my bed and I saw a guy dressed as a victorian. Just sitting there. Yet again, a silhouette. I went under my bed, thinking it was a dream, pinching myself and yet again, peaked over the duvet and he was still there. Frozen in fear, I  just convinced myself I was imagining things and went back to sleep.

Over the next few years, whenever I would jump into bed at night, I would hear a conversation between a man and a young girl. I had no idea what they would day, but every so often, she would start giggling. I live in a detached house, so there is no way it was neighbours who were talking. On top of this, I would hear someone go up the stairs a few steps and stop. Even the banister would creak. Yet again ""It's all my imagination, go to sleep"". 

Stuff even started to happen in the day time. If I was on the sofa facing away, I would be able to ""feel"" someone there. I don't know how to explain it, I just knew they were there. Then, when I was 12, I went upstairs in the daytime and I swear to God I saw my mum's hand curl around her bedroom door. There was her rings on the hand, yet she was at work at the time. I couldn't stop crying and a few years before hand I read that if you saw a families ""ghost"" then they or their relative would have a serious health scare or die. Not even 2 months later, my grandad had an anyurusm and died twice on the operating table. Fortunately he pulled through, however that room became a no go zone. I was brushing my hair, ready to go to school and I heard and felt someone breath down my neck. Even at 20 years old, I can only be in that room for 5 seconds tops before needing to run out. It just feels as if someone is watching me in there.

When I was 18, I moved away to university. I came home when I found out my friend's dad had terminal cancer and we went for drinks. I came home, went upstairs to get ready for bed then realised I left my phone downstairs. I ran down, fumbled with my coat then that's when it happened. I heard someone knock on the hollow wall next to me 3 times. I ran upstairs, got under the duvet and put it down to the alcohol.

Unfortunately, my friends dad died later that year. My friend came over one night when I was alone and we were watching Pearl Harbor. I fell asleep on the couch and suddenly got woken up by him ""We have to leave right now"". I replied in a haze ""what?"". He ran upstairs grabbing my arm and after he stopped sobbing, I asking ""what happened"". He said ""I was watching the film and I heard a creepy old woman say hello to me"". This is a fully grown, 21 year old man and he doesn't believe in anything paranomal, but he refuses to come to my house anymore. I have never seen him cry that much, even when his dad died.

The other day, I asked my mum and dad whether they believed in anything like this. Previously, they have always denied it. This day, I suppose they were feeling a bit more open. My dad said that when he was younger, he use to have an older friend who use to play with him. However, no one else saw him and swore it was an imaginary friend he had. My mum then went on to say when she is upset, she can hear her dead grandad telling her that everything is alright. They then went on to say they did an ouija board before I was born and a dark spirit lifted the glass and flung it across the room and broke the damn thing. In this house.

Since my younger experiences, when trying to sleep, I have felt something prod at me, even though no one is there. I've even seen shadows in my broom closet room that shouldn't be there. As I write this, I feel a strange presence and hear the floorboards moving, without anyone being awake. I don't know what the hell it is. Maybe it's my deceased great grandad, looking over me? Maybe my parents invited an unwelcome visitor into the house? Who knows? All I know is I'm glad as hell I live 300 miles away and only come back for a few weeks a year now.

a bit of backstory: My aunt has always been the sensitive one in the family having paranormal experiences her whole life whether it be at her own home or on family vacations.  She has tons of stories and I loved listening to them.

Continuing with my story, Kyle had a friend sleep over that night too. So there were two 12 year old boys, my 17 year old cousin, my girlfriend, and myself.  So we end up going out to dinner and coming back to the house to watch a movie before bed.  After the movie, Mal goes to bed but of course, the boys want to play.  So I build a fort for them in the computer room, which is upstairs with the rest of the bedrooms.  I remember building it in such a way that the bedsheet was tied to the inside door handle so that they couldn't leave the room (they wanted to sleep in the fort) or the fort would fall apart. Genius, i know.

So everyone goes to bed eventually.  My girlfriend and I sleep in the master bedroom in my Aunt and Uncle's bed, door closed, lights off, everything.  Here's where it get's weird.  Out of nowhere I wake up from a deep sleep to notice the ceiling fan on as well as the ceiling fan light.  The bedroom door is wide open.  The master bath door is cracked open and the light is on in there as well.  And to boot, the dog is in the room staring at me and she shit on the carpet next to the bed, something that I was told NEVER happens.  

I got up to check things out and everyone in the house was sleeping.  The fort was still intact, so it wasn't the boys. Mallory was fast asleep, and I woke up my girlfriend, so it wasn't her either.

Such a weird night. Nothing else happened after that. I turned off the lights, cleaned up the dog poop, and went back to sleep.  It was just really freaky to wake up in someone else's house with no explanation of the lights being turned on and doors opened.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_16eey0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/16eey0/housesitting_for_my_sensitive_aunt_i_had_my_first/,

I have always been sensative to paranormal activity and immediately got the feeling as if something was here the day we checked out the house and brought our first boxes over. I dismissed it as being paranoid because I almost always experience something in New places and figured I was just anxious. A month goes by and its quiet enough, a few sounds here and there. Last week on Sunday or Monday I started smelling things that didn't make since, a strong scent of alcohol from the bathroom, etc. I started hearing scuffles, it started to become more prominent. While up late drawing in our game room which is directly below the attic I hear a crash and scuffle and then silence in a matter of 5 minutes there was banging as if someone was pounding on the floor with their fists or a large man in boots was stomping right above my head. My boyfriend looked at me laughed and said damn mice. I got extremely anxious and tight chested. We then went straight to bed. 

About 2 days ago at 2-3am we were in the kitchen down stairs, I heard something to my left and saw a LARGE black figure move from the kitchen door way across the room and up the stairs. I was filled with a sense of anger, pure pissed off kill someone anger. I pulled my self out of this feeling and began to have a panic attack. I've been dealing with ghost and spirits since I was a kid, I ussually get a small indication of what the spirit is all about, if its depressing I feel like my mood gets slightly heavier. if its happy or comforting, i feel a warm sensation. Never in my life have I had such a strong rush of emotion from a spirit. 

Last night my boyfriend said something to me about how everytime he closes the shower curtain I open it, I haven't been messing with the shower curtain at all.

As to the setting of all of these, nearly every experience I've had has happened in my house. Ok, the way my house is set up. My room is at the front of the house, just off the kitchen through a very small hallway that also has the washer and dryer in it. In an open circle of rooms is first the kitchen, then the Den (living room) and the living room (fancy dining room). The living room and den both connect to the entrance way and then you turn to the left and around to the big hallways, which has three bedrooms connected to it, two on the side and one at the end, and a bathroom. The majority of these experiences happen in my room, the kitchen, and the Den.

I had my first experience 6 years ago, at the age of 13. Me, my 9 year old nephew, and 5 year old niece were all in my room having a pillow fight and just generally making a ruckus. I was standing with my back to the closed door and the two of them were standing on the bed. All of a sudden, in the middle of the pillow fight, my nephew yelled ""Look!"", which stopped us all in our tracks, and I looked back at the door. For what felt like minutes the three of us all stared as the doorknob slowly turned from side to side.
Me, being the oldest, finally worked up the courage to grab it while it was moving and I could feel it continuing to try and move in my hand as I opened the door to find nothing on the other side. All three of us ran into the den to make sure that my sister and Grandmother hadn't been messing with us, which, sure enough, they hadn't.

Later the next day after they had left, I tested the door out to see how that could possibly have happened and I found that the doorknob was so stiff and rusty that the only way it could be moved from the inside of the door would be if someone had been standing next to me, turning it back and forth themselves. Now, when I say this doorknob was rusty, it was *rusty*. My Grandmother, niece and nephew, and occasionally even me had trouble opening that door.

Over the course of the next three years only minor things would happen; a feeling of being watched at night, footsteps outside my door, and going through three digital clocks because the radio would go on and off by itself. For a while, I was scared to be alone, but I eventually got used to it. Over the course of those three years though, I had become very interested in the occult, and had finally convinced my dad to buy me a Ouija board, which I tried out at the first chance I could with my older brother, who had been visiting at the time.

I didn't realize how big of a mistake that was until the next night.

The next night was the first night things started to pick up. The footsteps that had been originally confined to outside my door moved to beside my bed, and continued nonstop every night for months after that. However, it didn't take quite that long for my bed to start shaking. That took about a week. The first time it happened was the first time I got scared enough to run and sleep with my mom since I was a little girl. After that, however, I never did that for a shaking bed again, despite it happening several nights a week.

One night, after having put up with this for a few weeks, I woke up on my back in the middle of the night for no reason. This was unusual as I couldn't sleep on my back no matter what, and I was an extremely heavy sleeper so nothing ever woke me up. I realized what had woken me up when I opened my eyes, however. Right there, above my face, was a huge shadow hand reaching for me. I jumped out of bed and across the room, turned on the light and looked around and saw nothing, and I had never and have never seen a shadow like that since. That was the second time I ran to sleep in my mom's bed.

The final major event that has happened in my home to me was probably the scariest. 
I had just laid down to go to sleep around midnight when I felt a slight burning on my thigh, in the shape of a hand that would have been twice the size of my brother's, which would have been nearly impossible for a human hand to get to. I laid there trying to figure out what was going on for what felt like forever until I felt a second hand on my other thigh and I noped my way right out of the room and jumped into my mom's bed, god be damned if it disturbs her.

I have other stories of my own from outside of that house, as well as my brother's, mom's, and my brother's dad's. This has already gotten too long so I'll post the others later if there is enough interest. Also, no, I don't use the Ouija board anymore and very little has happened since then.

I was pretty young. Me and my older sister had gotten into some kind of argument and in a rage, my dad grabbed me and threw me into my room. Now, its about 8pm, my room is dark and the lights are out so naturally, I'm scared. But what happened next scared me even more. Instinctively, i try to leave my room. As i open the door, the doorway is blocked. Not by my dad or my sister, but something else. All i can remember is... it... Blocking my way by holding its arms outwards... and another four arms stretching up and down diagonally, think of the shape the red takes on the Union Jack flag and you've got the right idea. Of course, i slammed the door, dived under my covers and hid.
Never really thought about it after that.
Until my sister told me a few years ago that she had seen the exact same thing. Bear in mind, i didn't tell her about my encounter.
Then, 2 years ago.
I'm hanging out with my friend Brian and his roomie John. I'd known John previously as his family lived across from me in the same flats complex as i grew up in. One night, while smoking a few joints and talking about scary experiences, John tells us about something he saw while living in the flats. A tall figure who stood in front of his door with six arms. No features, just black. Same as i am now while typing this out, my eyes started to well up as i told him that myself and my sister had seen the exact same thing.
That was the last time i ever spoke about it. For those interested, the flats in question are called St. Teresas Gardens in Dublin, Ireland.

It was all about this infamous, long road (I think it was in Australia or Germany or something?) going through this heavily forested area where people have experienced all these different sorts of weird and paranormal phenomena: strange lights/orbs, unexplained loud noises, UFOs, an exorbitant amount of vehicular accidents, etc...

Then there was this audio clip lower down on the page from some ""Coast to Coast"" type radio show. The host was calling some guy being held in an insane asylum and this was his story: So he was a truck driver (hauling cargo of some sort) driving down this road surrounded by forest when realized he was gonna run out of gas soon (at this point he was about halfway along the road). So he flags down this other truck and asks if the driver could bring some gas back to him, just enough that he could get out of the heavily forested part of the road and find a gas station. The driver says no because in order to bring this guy some gas, he would have to drive through the forest **AT NIGHT**; and apparently creepy shit happens at night along this road. And the guy who ran out of gas doesn't wanna leave his truck and cargo along the side of the road overnight, so he suggests to the other driver that he'll just spend the night in his truck and maybe the other driver can bring him some gas in the morning? The other driver says sure, but really warns this guy not to spend the night there. The guy says he'll be find and settles into his truck to sleep as the other guy drives off.

A few hours later, this guy awakes to his truck being shaken a bunch from the side. It stops and so naturally this dumbass **GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK TO INVESTIGATE**. He's looking down this ravine or something when suddenly he gets hit on the head and he comes to finding himself being dragged along the ground by some big, hairy creature. This creature drags him to its little camp site like area and this guy sees a bunch of human legs hanging on a close line of sorts. Somehow, he escapes and finds his way back to the truck where he takes refuge for the rest of the night. This must have messed him up bad because, as I said before, he was in an insane asylum.

Has anyone ever seen this and can anyone point me in the right direction? Do you even just know the name of the road? Thanks erbody.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,e,True,t3_sn2nx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/sn2nx/i_need_your_help_rparanormal/,

Somehow by himself he cut, lifted and placed the stones with out the help of any tools other than simple hand tools,  pulleys, a yet to be understood tripod and a hand-made power generator. 

[In Search Of: *Season 5 - Episode 16* ""The Castle of Secrets""] (http://youtu.be/jqyH8ueCAsY)

The theories on how the place was built are endless... Aliens, Magnetism/Anti-gravity, wormholes... They are all there. I plan on being there for a few hours in the morning and while I doubt I'll crack it, at least I can get you a picture of the parts you are interested in as well as ask questions of the caretakers and guides and report in tomorrow night.

**UPDATE 1:** Well after a long series of events going wrong we are currently in an Inn near the MIA. We are going to be heading over in the morning when they open. Here are the things I will focus on:

* Get pictures of the roof of the ""engine house"" (I may not be able to get ontop or high enough to see it, but I will try.)
* Get Pictures of the rotating stone door's joints
* Video of me Rotating the door (That will be your ""proof,"" though I'm confused why you want me to verify when the whole exercise is pretty much a ""Take a picture of this for me"" thread...)
* Anything else I find interesting that I have not yet seen

They open at 9AM EST and I will be there around that time. I have the ability to save pictures to my Skydrive Account where I have made this folder accessible for viewing by the internet. As long as my battery holds out and I have cell service I will try to upload pictures every spare moment I have. Cant upload videos on the go to skydrive. I will have to send any videos I make to youtube or something, so expect that later. 

Folder is at [https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=E3914FE6DDC4CC35&amp;id=E3914FE6DDC4CC35%211563](https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=E3914FE6DDC4CC35&amp;id=E3914FE6DDC4CC35%211563).

As always, post anything you come up with, and I'll do my best!

**UPDATE 2:** Well I just got back from the Miami area and I am now trying to upload my pictures. 

While the staff there are very friendly and answered all kinds of questions I ran into two issues. First, they watch you like a hawk. Over the years several parts of the castle have been broken or have hurt someone, so when some crazy looking black guy in an overcoat starts running around taking pictures they may stop him to ask questions. While they where happy that /r/Paranormal/ was interested in the place (They asked that I tell you they have ""invited"" you all to come sometime and see it for your self) they have a strict no video policy. They then pointed me to the large collection of DVD's in their gift shop... 

... Anyway, while I did get to touch the rock gate and the 9-Ton Gate I discovered the extent of the damage from the 1986 ""repair."" While the gate still moves, the replacement barrings have proved to be a poor stand-in for the original Model-T parts. Bundle that with the fact that nobody but Ed knew what the center of balance is for this stone the joints have too much stress and over the years since have made the door very hard to push. While not as dramatic in size, The Rock Gate at the entrance was made in the same way as the 9-ton Gate but has never rusted out or been taken apart and as such still ""glides"" with a single finger. The sight is quite stunning and I wish I could have taken video of it. They where kind enough to let me climb up a bit and take pictures of the top and bottom joint of the 9-Ton Gate as well as a picture leaning on it. It seems that although areas some are barred off, they will still let you touch if you ask.

I was surprised to learn how much Ed explained to others. While the knowledge of stone lifting and placement died with him, he did let people know how he got his raw materials. He would carve the shape of the stone out as a block and then place wedges along the bottom. Each line on the side of a stone in any of the pictures you see is a wedge mark. When there was enough pressure wedging them up, the block would pop loose. He would not tell how he lifted the stones but once ready to be moved he used a series of tree trunks strong and steady enough to be used today as light poles. The Poles would be then moved to form a track to wherever the stone needed to be lifted or placed. Again, nobody is to clear on that.

All in all, the place is amazing! I will go again in the future, but right now I'm still slack-jawed.

I wanted to share something that happened and, I guess, is still happening to me regarding the number 6 and Roulette.

About five years ago, my friends and I went down to Atlantic City for the night.  At this time in my life,I didn't have much money so I just used to enjoy being at the casino/nightclubs with my friends and not gamble much.

In the first hour of arriving, a group of us were by the roulette tables looking onto a table where my friend was playing.  I was talking to my other friend behind the one at the table.  Our conversation had ended and I was watching people place their bets on the table when I heard, and felt, ""Six..."" in my ear.  I quickly turned to look around me, but no one was even close to me.  The only way I can explain this voice was if, literally, someones lips were half an inch away from my ear and it let out more air then vocals.  It was a whisper and it even tickled a little.

I immediately turned to my friend and tapped him on the shoulder.  He turns around and I say, 'Put something on six.'  He looked at me like I was an idiot and turned back to the table.  Right after, my friend who was not playing strikes up another conversation and, submersed in a story, I briefly forget about what just happened.

Then I hear my player friend. ""Hey...hey!  It hit six.  So..what else you got?"" He said half-jokingly.

I was shocked, but also amazed.  Purely coincidence I thought to myself.  Nothing else happened that night.  Purely coincidence.

Fast forward to last night.  After a few beers my friend talks me going into a local casino with him.  This place doesn't have live table games, but you can grab an electronic roulette table and place some bets on the second floor.  I don't care that much for high gambling, but I took out a hundred and entertained my friend while he gambled.  After a few rounds I was hitting numbers and decided, before I lost it, to ticket out and go get my money.

My friend was continuing to play at that same roulette table as I walked around the casino checking out other games and just observing the community.  There wasn't much I was into so I walked back to that same table, sat down next to my friend, and take out my phone to answer a text.

This time, I did not hear it.  I felt it.  With every ounce of my brain and body.  It felt as if someone was screaming at me to do something.  SIX SIX SIX SIX SIX SIX!! 

I quickly took out and dumped 20 bucks into the machine and was able to drop 15 dollars on six before all bets were off.

Just in time.  Six.  It hits.  I cash out and go get my money from the machine.  I come back quietly and sit their puzzled.  Oddly enough this is the same friend who wouldn't take my advice five years ago and also remembers.  He looks at me and says, ""You really like six, huh?""  

Do any of you have occurrences similar to this?  Can anyone help me identify what is happening?


TL:DR - Something paranormal is telling me when the roulette table will hit six.

1376409097.0,29,self.Paranormal,1ka7zg,Haunted Pharmacies,vi0letwaves,33,4,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ka7zg/haunted_pharmacies/,"I worked at a CVS for about seven years, during that time I moved around to a couple of stores and I had paranormal encounters in more than one of them.

I think first it's important to learn the history of the properties that these pharmacies were built on. The first one I had experiences at was built on a plot of land that housed several types of businesses before CVS ended up there. Before CVS it was a restaurant (that my mother worked in and had her own paranormal experiences at) and before that it was a carriage house/tavern back in the 1800's. The carriage house burned to the ground and a woman died in it. 

I worked at this location for about a year and had some really strange things happen that I just can't for the life of me explain logically. One night I was walking past our photo counter and a pack of labels (basically the same as a ream of paper, except labels) came flying off of the counter at me. I don't mean just slipped off and fell, it flew about 5 feet across the floor. This wasn't the only time objects went flying, our stock in the back had a nice habit of doing that as well. My mother said when she worked at the restaurant that was there (years ago, back in the 80's) that they would come in to find bread all over the place. Like someone had just thrown it around. 

Another time our fire alarm got ripped off the wall (the red, emergency pull handle type). It was in the back, completely blocked off by a heavy display and it just became completely ripped off the wall. We had cameras facing that aisle and there was nobody there when it happened. We had to evacuate and close the store while the fire department came and made sure everything was okay. When they went to see about the alarm that had been pulled, they discovered it had been violently ripped out of the wall. They had to duct tape it back up to get the alarm to stop sounding. 

Some of the other employees had different experiences, but those were the ones I had before I moved to my new store, which was far more strange than this one.

The second CVS I had paranormal experiences in was built on part of the old Huber farm here. There was at least one confirmed murder on the land and part of the original land included a good sized cemetery down the road. I worked overnights at this store and I think that's why we had so many more experiences here. I'm honestly not even sure where to begin with this one. Mind you, I worked the 10PM - 8AM shift, there was rarely anyone in the store except me and another employee. The front door had an alarm that went off every single time it opened. No one could come in or leave and we wouldn't know about it. This was especially helpful overnight because we would often have work to do upstairs in the stockroom. I can only think of one occurrence I had there when a customer was present, everything else I'm about to tell you happened with just me and my coworker there.

The first weird thing that happened to me there was hearing children giggling. This happened once in a while and sometimes I would think I'd catch a glimpse of a shadow in the direction the sound came from. 

Another time I was walking back up to the front of the store and I passed an aisle and saw a man. About 6', white t-shirt, blue jeans, dark hair, attractive. I stopped really quick and backed up to double check because I didn't think anyone was in the store. He was gone in the two seconds it took me to take two steps back. I walked through the whole store twice over and there was nobody in there. 

Another time I was standing in our backroom (on the main floor) in the middle of the room. There wasn't anything within ten feet of me, nothing I could have snagged myself on. Something tugged the back of my shirt with enough force that it made me step back a few steps. Like if someone pinched a section of your shirt and tugged you to come closer. 

Many of us heard disembodied voices. One girl, Brittany, was about 8 months pregnant at the time and was getting ready to walk down the steps with a box when she heard a woman say ""be careful"". Another time I was upstairs working by myself and I heard a woman ask me ""What are you doing?"". And one time my coworker, Jeff, and I were walking up the steps together after clearing the store and we both heard a man yell ""hello?"". We both stopped dead in our tracks and ran back down to make sure nobody was there. The store was empty.

The next few things happened when my friend, Tabby, and I were working together. The first is the ONLY occasion I ever had something happen when a customer was around. Tabby had just finished ringing up this young woman and we were walking out the door right behind her to go smoke a cigarette. As we're all heading to the door, Tabby and I see a guy dressed all in white ran past the front door. It was enough that it triggered the motion sensor and opened the door/rang the bell. I said something to Tabby about the guy moving so quick and she was like ""I know, right?"" and the woman in front of us just turned around and said ""What guy?"" We all ran out into the parking lot and there was no one there. We checked the cameras and he wasn't on them. You can see the doors opening, but there was no guy. There was no guy coming through the parking lot either. 

I think the scariest thing though was the thing that happened just before I left CVS. It was about 3AM one night and it was just me and Tabby in the store. We were standing at the front counter talking. I had my back to the office (our office was elevated above the coolers with the one way mirror deal going on. You could sort of see in when the lights were on - only the managers had a key to get in) and Tabby was facing me talking. Out of nowhere she stops mid sentence and gets this creeped out look on her face. ""I just saw something in the office."" she said. At this point, we had all established that there was weird things going on here so I said ""okay, well let's go look at the cameras"". Our cameras were all motion activated and only recorded when they detected motion. So we walk upstairs and sit down at the camera monitor and I pull up the office camera. It started recording a full 30 seconds before we came up there and I have never in my life seen anything like what I saw. First, our cameras were bolted to the ceiling. They didn't move, they didn't turn, there was no wiggling them. Right after the camera started recording it started violently shaking, like there was an earthquake or something going on. Then, right before you see us appear from the steps this green, demonic looking face appeared in the glass. Mind you, there was no motion in front of that camera until we reached the top of the stairs. I saved the security footage, but I lost the DVD sometime during the years since I left there. I wish I still had it, it was some of the creepiest stuff I have ever seen.

So anyway, those were my experiences at my old job. I have other experiences, unrelated to CVS, but I'll save those for another time.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1ka7zg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ka7zg/haunted_pharmacies/,

Since this first encounter I had why by myself I have brought my still digital camera, camcorder and gopro to work in order to catch something worth bringing to you folks. Sadly this has yet to happen.

However last night, Aug-4-2013, I invited my close friend over to walk around the building with me. He is very interested in the paranormal and likes a good scare every now and then as well. A hour or so went by with nothing more than a few little bumps here and there. Most could be explained by the either the building settling or the floor boards bending under our feet. It seemed like my friend wasn't going to be experiencing anything tonight. Then he suggests we split up and search separately.

Reluctantly I agree to this and we part ways. Using our iPhones we kept in close contact using a walkie app. After close to twenty minutes my friend calls me.
""Did you just go up to the 4th floor?"" he asked
""No I'm on the ground level. South corridor.""

It was silent for what seemed like forever. It was only about a minute but when all you can really hear is your own heart beat it seems like a long time. Then I damn near jump out of my skin when i hear my friends voice over the phone telling me,
""Nope! Done! I'm headed back down to the front doors.""

I quickly went to the front doors and my friend tells me after hearing what sounded like a door in the stairwell closing he went to go check it out. He explained he thought at first it must have been a worker but I assured him that he and I were the only ones in the building when he first showed up. Once we got to the top (4th floor) he was met with a long dark hallway.
[This Hallway](http://i.imgur.com/o6QctvD.png)

He told me once in the hallway it felt really quite to the point that it was unnerving. He tells me he walked about halfway down the hall then heard a shuffling behind him and turned around to see nothing. He calls down the hall thinking I'm just messing around with him. He turns back and continues down the hall then hears a loud bump similar to how it would sound if someone one floor above you were to jump up and down. That single hollow thump was unheard by me but he tells me it was right behind him and right after the thump he hears a low groan by his shoulder. Then he ran.

He then apologized to me and told me he is leaving. I told him good night and let him leave.

1372471378.0,29,self.Paranormal,1hadz2,I think there's something in my room,TheDroidYouWant,35,6,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1hadz2/i_think_theres_something_in_my_room/,"A few weeks ago, I was sleeping my room when I suddenly woke up with my heart pounding. When I opened my eyes, there was this weird, short...creature standing a few feet away from me, staring at my bed and me in it. For a minute, I was sure I was still sleeping, because there was no way it could possibly be in my locked room. 
There's really no good way to describe it...it was maybe three feet tall, and it was black/brown all over. It's eyes were too big, relative to our human eyes, and it could see in the dark (clearly, since it was looking at me). **I should note at this point, my room never gets completely dark, I live right by a well-lit street and it's never entirely black in my room.** As soon as I came to the realization that I was, in fact, awake, the thing turned around, bolted across the room, jumped on my counter, and vanished mid-step. 

Needless to say, it scared the crap out of me. I spent the rest of the night with my light on, barely sleeping because I was terrified of whatever had been in my room. 

Now, I'd pretty much managed to convince myself I was going crazy, and hadn't actually seen anything in my room. Then, last weekend, I saw the same thing again in my room. This time, I woke up and it was sitting on my counter (right by where it disappeared last time) and was sort of kicking its legs while staring at my room. It looked kind of like a kid sitting in a chair, honestly. I sat there staring at it in the dark for probably a full minute before I reached for my lamp. While struggling to find the lamp switch, I turned my head for barely a split second and when the light turned on and I looked back, the thing was gone.

Now, other weird stuff has been happening. My radio will turn on when I am nowhere near it, and things I have left in a certain place will disappear for days, then turn up in some other place. 

I don't know what it is going on, and frankly, I feel like I am going crazy. So, I am turning to you, Reddit. Does anyone have any idea what is going on? Am I just losing it?

**Edit: After reading the comments, I realized I didn't include much description. I am horrible at describing what things look like for people, but here goes...

Like I said, it was probably around 3 feet tall. I say this because it was a bit taller than my couch. Like I said, the eyes were too big. They were pretty much round or I guess the word is oblong? It was very skinny, and its skin had a weird texture. For whatever reason, I thought it looked like bark. It also had kind of large ears.

Also, I don't know if this matters at all, but I am a girl, not a guy. I hope that helps a little bit. Thanks a bunch, everyone!**

I'm not going to say I'm a psychic, but most of the ""experiences"" I've had are from touching objects and seeing things. It's not predictable, and I'm not even sure what it's called. Sometimes the images aren't really clear or what exactly I'm seeing. I also experience deja vu a lot. 

Anyway, on to the story. Around 9 years ago, my husband and I were house hunting. The houses in our area that were in our price range were usually fixer uppers and older construction from around the 50's. It wasn't fun. There was one house we went to that was a very unique experience. The house was from the 60's, it was small very plain with a main level and basement. There wasn't anything particular  off about the house, except that it was very empty. We were at the end of the open house, around 4 pm. We were just going to run through it really quickly. We look through the first level, three bedrooms, very outdated kitchen, nothing off. We get to the basement and it was pretty nice. It was a basic, ""60's"" finished basement with a bar and tile. Looks like the previous owners entertained down there with mad men style cocktail parties. So my husband and I decide to leave and I go up the stairs first. Suddenly, I felt two hands on my back and a man's whisper saying ""GO GO, UP THE STAIRS!"" I say, ""Stop pushing me! I'm going!"" thinking it was my husband. I get up the stairs, turn around and my husband is at the bottom of the stairs looking confused at me. He was able to walk up the stairs fine. We left really quickly, both freaked out. When he got outside, he said, ""When I walked up the stairs, it felt like it was 30 degrees colder!"" We both were pretty freaked out. We didn't want the house anyway because it was very small. I do wonder if the person who bought it is dealing with a haunted house now.

With that said, let's get the ball rolling.

I was sixteen or seventeen at the time and my relationship with Leighanna had grown to the point our parents didn't mind if we shared a bed. More often than not I spent the night at her house because her mom was far more lenient than my parents. For obvious reasons I took full advantage of this and spent several nights with her.

She and her little brother had told me several times of the strange and terrifying things they had experienced here, but I never really saw anything worth noting. My doubts were quickly abandonded though.

We were asleep together in her room when I was woken up by the sound of scratching. In my addled state I assumed a rodent or something of similar size had gotten in her wall. Naturally I got up, put my ear to the wall and awaited more shuffling. Upon hearing nothing I gave the wall a few sharp taps to scare whatever it was out so I could go back to bed. I had no idea what a mistake I had made.

I got back into bed and not a moment after the air had escaped the blanket did I hear the scratching again. Being young and fueled by testosterone, I promptly got back up and hit the wall with a closed fist. Thinking this had surely done the trick I turned back to get into bed when the scratching started again, on the opposite wall.

My skin tightened and the grog of waking up unexpectedly wore off. Something wasn't right. I walked to the opposite wall and put my ear to it to assess the disturbance. Hearing nothing again, I attempted my previous method and banged the wall with my fist. I put my ear to the wall again and paused. Silence.

I stood up, pushed my chair in, and took about four steps into the kitchen (it's a very small space) and heard the screeching sound the chair makes when it moves across the floor.

It was slid out at a 45 degree angle from the desk, like you would do if you were turning it outward to sit down, except there's no one there. The only people here are me and my 3 year old, who was in the kitchen with me. The dog was sitting on the other end of the kitchen from the desk.

They have two kids, an eleven year-old girl, and a three year-old boy,  two dogs, and a black cat.

Last time I talked to her she told me about this issue they have, that their son often doesn't sleep well and wakes up at night. He will tell about a 'mister' and 'mrs.' that are in his room when he wakes up.
According to him, the mister will use a saw to saw the feet of his chair, or saw at his face. He also calls him 'the sawmister'.
The daughter also says she can see faces in her room at night, at a certain corner in her room.

My aunt and uncle didn't see anything, but they also noticed scratching sounds in her closet at night. She thought it might be their cat, but they checked a few times and there was nothing there.

My cousin also notices sounds sometimes.

I thought this was interesting, and then I also remembered the two times I slept over at their place, once in the room with the 'sawmister' and once in the 'faces' room. I remember being extremely uncomfortable and somehow being unable to sleep, especially in the sawmister room. At the time, I had that feeling you probably all know, of being watched, or that there was something there.

Gotta go to work, will rewrite and  update later....

EDIT: So my mom is a huge believer in ghosts and other paranormal phenomenon, and I'm quite interested too, so we were discussing it today, but I don't really know what to think of it.

My aunt and especially my uncle are not the type of people to believe in this stuff, I was kind of surprised that they brought it up. My aunt knows someone who claims to be 'psychic' and said she's going to make an appointment with her to find out what's going on.

One night I had this dream, which didn't seem abnormal at all--just a weird dream like everybody has. 

In the dream, my family and I were seated at a table in a room decorated with all sorts of golden ornaments and decorations. There were other people around too, I just didn't pay any attention to them in my dream. Anyway, I specifically remembered the seating arrangement. It was a small four person table and on one side was sitting my mom, and then me next to her, with my stepdad sitting opposite my mom and my sister sitting next to him, opposite me. Were were talking about dream gibberish but I specifically remember my mom all of a sudden talking about peanut butter. Weird.

Anyway, I though nothing of this weird dream. The next night, my family says they want to go out for dinner. I insist chinese, but they want to have thai food, which I had never even had before. They want to go to a restaurant called Bangkok West which I had also never gone to before. So we get to the restaurant, and my sister, being a teenage girl, has to call one of her friends about some bullshit, so she stays outside in the parking lot to do so. My stepdad gets caught up in a business call or something and so he does the same, staying in the car. So my mom and I go inside to get a table for four. We sit down at the table without my sister and stepdad. I first sit in the chair across from my mom. But then I get this weird feeling or compulsion to sit next to her, so I do. It didn't feel like a *weird* desire to do so, it just seemed sort of more appropriate. Anyway, after a few minutes my stepdad comes in and sits across from my mom, and my sister comes in and takes the only remaining seat, across from me. 

At this point, I still don't realize anything odd. So we are all sitting there, sipping water, chatting the way you would when just sitting down at the table. My mom starts talking about other thai restaurants she's been to before. And then she starts talking about peanut butter. About how one time in a thai restaurant she saw a cabinet in the kitchen stocked with jars of skippy peanut butter. And then I realize the familiarity of everything. From what I remember from the dream, my mom had been talking about skippy peanut butter. And the restaurant was decorated wall to wall with golden statues of Buddha and that sort of thing. And the seating arrangements were exact. It blew my mind how accurate, down to every detail everything was--the decoration of the restaurant, the seating arrangements (and my weird compulsion to sit next to my mom), and my mom talking about skippy peanut butter. I can't think of any explanation for this.

**tl;dr** In a dream I predicted the seating arrangements and decor of a trip to a restaurant I had never been to, and specifically what my mom started talking about when we went there the next night.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_18oels,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18oels/i_guess_ill_share_my_most_intriguing_paranormal/,

I'm in college now, but when I was about 12 years old I went to my (then, recently deceased) great grandmothers house which is the oldest house in its county(if I remember correctly its original one room log cabin frame dates back to pre-revolution). Every time I go there something happens, but i digress... 
One night I was sleeping in the ""green bedroom"" which is the one where my great grandma kept most of her personal belongings. My mom was sleeping next to me in the bed, and she's a deep sleeper. I was having trouble falling asleep, I was tossing and turning trying to get comfortable when I noticed a glowing human sized blob in the doorway. It almost looked like bright moonlight being cast on the door, but the door was open so there was nothing for moonlight to be cast onto. I looked at it for a while then realized it seemed ""alive"" (alive as a ghostly apparition can be). Being a 12 year old girl I immediately assumed the worst and dove under the heavy quilt even though it was incredibly hot in an old farm house with no air conditioning. I layed under the blanket for a long time just listening for any sign that the weird blob was moving. As I lay there I started to hear a female voice saying, ""it's okay."" and, ""don't be scared."" I didn't want to believe that the apparition could be talking to me so I just tried to ignore it and eventually I was able to fall asleep. When I woke up the next morning I asked my mother if she had said anything to me in the middle of the night, such as comforting words because I seemed scared. She had no idea what I was talking about. I now assume it was my great grandma visiting, but you never know those things for certain. Later that day my mother and grandmother were getting into an argument in the kitchen when a potted plant started rocking back and forth violently to the point where it was almost falling off the table. My mother took notice and said, ""ok! we'll stop."" and the pot stopped shaking.

Moved to Maryland about 10 years ago, love it down here. I grew up in a town called Medford in Mass. , it was a good sized house and very old. My mother and her family had lived there for years, she was the youngest of 9 kids and I had uncles who died of old age before I was even born!

I had 2 of my uncles die in the house years ago, along with a family friend all between 1935-1955. When I was 6 my older sister was crossing the street with me and was hit by a car, she was just badly banged up. later that night she didn't want to be alone so she had me sleep in her room, I was about 6 years old at the time and I had seen shadows moving, heard things for months prior.

That night after the car hitting her I heard some footsteps coming down the hallway towards our room, a tall figure...thought it was my dad. the figure came into the room..patted my sister on the head and left. about 10 minutes later my dad came home from work and I heard him come into the house! Told my mom about it and she said that her Dad's ghost has been seen on this floor of the house before!

I would see faces on walls here and there as time went on, it was a very active old house. We moved away to Reading Mass. a few years later and I spent the majority of my life there. I have stayed over night at the Lizzie Borden house, been inside the Danvers State Medical Hospital numerous times before it was converted into the Avalon Apts. also been to Spider Gates Cemetery, and the Blood Cemetery in Hollis NH.

Bottom line is over the years I have become a fan of the supernatural and have visited many places over the past 20 years all over New England. I still continue to see spirits on a regular basis and also have predicted a few deaths from being in contact with people before they died..which I don't like at all. I can also detect strange smells in certain places.

I'm looking for a possible group to go hunting with that are possibly in MD. anyone interested let me know, or to just be friends on here. I have a wide area of knowledge on the occult, and many books as well.

These spirits, we call them george and matilda, are very active in their home. They are a welcome part of our family and we are very proud of them and their antics. For a few decades, several handprints have marked the transom light over the inner front door of the house. The handprints are usually always there, but sometime they disappear for years without reason or they will arrange themselves in odd fashions. These handprints are not on either sides of the glass (I have personally taken windex and elbow grease to both sides) The handprints seem to be inside the pane of glass. What I am wondering, for you paranormal investigators, is this: Are there any other incidences like this? Why would a spirit do this?

He sent out an invitation to anyone willing to prove that their house was haunted. If willing, a group of independent paranormal investigators would investigate and then submit the results to the governor.

The whole topic has been very hush-hush with her family for years.  Recently, a woman called her out of the blue to talk to her.  She was in town and had a dream about my wife and tracked her down.  Whe needed to meet my wife and ""tell her some things.""  My wife and her best friend met her at the hotel this woman was staying at and had a very interesting evening.  The woman (who keep in mind had never met my wife before today) told her that she could see her brother's aura (Jade in color) watching over her, and asked if we ever found random spare change.  Oddly enough, we continuously find spare change in small piles throughout our house.  Have for years.  We never really use much cash and try to keep things picked up, but we always will find a few cents here and there, probably once or twice a week where there shouldn't be.  

This woman explained to us that sometimes powerful energies/auras will do things like that as a sign that they are around and looking over us and that it was my wife's brother saying ""Hello.""  

Edit: a few more details to add after my wife read the posts and comments:
The lady contacted my wife several months after my wife called a ""mind and day spa"".  The person my wife wanted to talk to wasn't in that day and my wife never called back.  The woman who called us was her friend who had come into town to visit and felt compelled to call due to a series of dreams she had had.  When she called she asked if my wife was the lady who called about her brother.  My wife had never mentioned why she had called originally.

It's a mix of coins, old and new and different denominations.  In fact my wife and I are laughing right now because she just found 41 cents on our bedroom floor which she had just cleaned this afternoon! 1 penny, 1 nickel, 1 dime, and 1 quarter.

I need your take redditors!!!,arthur_montague,33,4,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/kwnua/odd_happenings_at_my_new_abode_i_need_your_take/,"My girlfriend, her three kids and myself all just moved into a new house last week and we are having odd occurrences taking place. Before I continue I should also mention the house was built in the late 1800's.

The first thing experienced was the other day my girlfriend came home to find her toothbrush and toothbrush holder laying on the bathroom floor about four feet from the sink. No one had been in or out of the house since I left with the kids that morning. I was the last one in the bathroom and the items were on the sink when I left.

Yesterday morning I woke up (I was the only one awake) went downstairs to use the bathroom after I did so I returned to our bedroom to get ready for work. I went back down approximately 10 minutes later (still the only person awake) and walked into the bathroom to find a small bottle of shampoo sitting vertical in the middle of the floor.

Last night we had all gone to our old place to clean up and returned later that night. My girlfriends son went into the front room where the front door and it was open and unlocked. My girlfriend and I know for a fact that it was locked and closed when we left since we are security freaks. The other odd part is the screen door which you must travel through (it's an enclosed porch) was still locked. 

Other odd things include unexplained sounds (and not just house settling sounds) these including knocking, footsteps, and general rummaging through our belongings. 

I should point out that her son is 15 and could be labeled as a troubled teen, and one of her daughters is 10 and is about to hit puberty. From what I have read about poltergeists they tend to use the energy from kids like ours.

Another interesting thing is the house was rented to us at a to-good-to-be-true price and the previous tenant moved out three months prior to the end of their lease yet continued to pay rent but also refused to come back and get belongings. Our landlords also asked us about five or six times on whether we were positive that we wanted the place with almost apprehension in their voices.

If these kinds of things are already taking place only a week into our new lives there I am very curious as to what may happen in the coming months. What more should I expect to have happen? Should I have a paranormal group come investigate? Or should I just enjoy living in a haunted house?

My little brother used to always have nightmares when he was little, and he had a bad habit of always coming into my room and sleeping with me in my bed because he was scared.. He was 4 years old at the time..

Anyways.. One night.. he started crying.. It sounded like a painful cry, or a bothersome cry... I went to his room to find him under his blankets, and every time I would try to uncover his face to talk to him, He would shake and let out a terrible whine/cry... I had to keep reminding him, it was I who was in the room... 
I asked him why he was crying like that, and he looked towards his closet and pointed to ""the boy"". At that moment, all I felt were goosebumps all over my body.. 
Doing whatever possible to Make the situation more comfortable, I would assure him it was only me and him in the room.... 
As I hugged him.. He backed away while looking at the closet and screamed... He said the little boy wanted to pull him by the arms... That he was his friend, but he had to give him his arms to be able to continue to be his friend. He cried for days.. and there came a time where he would stay awake for days, until he finally crashed out in random places.. He wouldn't sleep because he said the boy would try to take his arms when he was asleep, and he wouldn't feel it, because he doesn't feel when he sleeps.. 
We called in a spiritual reader, and our house was said to be filled with an unsatisfied soul. That the soul had many duties he needed to fulfill, and he needed some extra help. Someone needed to give him a hand....

Ever since that day, we have continuously been purifying the room with holy water.. 
It is impossible to be comfortable in that room at night...

Now I can't sit through an episode as it just seems like Stephen King fiction and not a retelling of a true event.

Paranormal Witness S01E01 was a great example of a proven real event with multiple independent witnesses experiencing phenomena. Now Paranormal Witness just seems like a ghost in my house/restaurant/farm story time.

My Ghost Stories is, as we all know, basically the ""My Camera Saw A Bug And I Am Saying Its An Orb To Go On Tv Story"".

People like Steve Huff walk around a new suburb in Arizona making out that every noise he hears is a ghost (see: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y_BeIHb-Tc). He has the sound of his footsteps, cars, pets, his clothes brushing together, the wind, sound from neighbours homes and he makes it out to be EVPs and even created something called a reverse EVP where the EVP has a message played forward and also backwards (Beatles songs anyone?)! How could a dead person work out how to do that? It is just you or me, now not a mortal being. So, we start to talk backwards after we die?

Anyway, my point of this post is to ask for links to genuine, believable evidence of life after death. I have basically grown out of this stuff and I want to believe again!

I don't know whether to call these paranormal encounters or overactive imagination. 

My first encounter was when I was about 6 or 7. I was taking a shower before going to bed one evening. My mom had just opened the door to throw me my pj's. I heard the door open again and peaked out of the shower curtain to see what I thought my mom wanted. Instead of my mom, I see a mass of stringy red ""rubber bands"" dangling through the cracked door. The mass just dangled for about 2-3 seconds then it retracted and the door shut. I thought it might be my little sister and shrugged it off. I got out of the shower and went to ask her what my sister wanted but she was already asleep. I asked my mom if she was trying to throw some rubber bands in the bathroom but she didn't know what I was talking about. My parents laughed at me when I explained what I saw. 

Flash forward 6 or so years later my family moved and a had another encounter. Funny thing, I was in the shower again. In the new house the bathroom had an entrance from my parents room and a main hallway. The new shower had a sliding glass door that was clouded. I heard the door from my parents room open. This happened sometimes when the front house door was opened. There was some kind of pressure thing and the door didn't really latch and would open on its own. I didn't think anything of it until I glanced in the direction of the door and saw through the clouded glass some moving red object. I slid open the shower door to see the same mass of red rubber bands. The mass stayed for about 3 seconds before disappearing out the cracked door. This time I jumped out of the shower to see what it was but when I opened my parents door nothing was there. I ran through there room to the hallway and other bathroom door, but nothing. My parents were watching TV and my sister wasn't home. 

This has happened 3 more times. The other incidents were later at an apartment I moved in to involving a window when I was 19. Another incident in a hotel hallway around when I was 23. The last time was about 3 years ago in my garage while the garage door was closing. All incidents the mass is just out of site and doesnt stick around for more the a few seconds.The last couple of times I've tried to talk to ""it"" but get no response. 

I have never really experienced anything else paranormal like. I'm a pretty sane guy but could never explain this. I'm 30 now and I'm half expecting another visit sometime soon.

This is not a normal /r/paranormal loud bangs in the night deal, this needs attention and I need serious input. In fact, most of the encounters and experiences aren't in my apartment at all, but in the complex and area surrounding a recent murder.

I moved into these apartments right after this horrible event happened, near or even maybe on the same day even, and I've had one of the most recent experiences on the same day a month prior to the date of his murder, July 30th.

When we first came here, my father and I, the landlord was going to give us a smaller place and we didn't like it, so we asked if there was a better unit available and she showed us what is now our apartment. When we said we would take it, she was almost shocked, it was strange enough for me to remember how she acted when we said we wanted this unit, the condition and space is 100 x's better than the other one so her reaction was very odd. I'm not sure if Quietens mother (Quentin is the guy that was murdered) where he was going before he was murdered lived here, or if this was one of his friends or family members apartments or anything, but I've had a list of very strange experiences in this area and recently, across the street at the store near where he was murdered.

These are 2 one of the many articles, I chose them because one (the longer one) is my towns newspaper, it explains what happened from beginning to end, including the results from the criminal trial against the murderer. The other one does also if you would prefer a quick read, if you have the time please read both.

*Full story from my towns paper.*

http://www.thereporter.com/ci_22439653/jury-weighs-mans-fate-vacaville-murder-trial

The recent events I've experienced are quite strange and extremely telling, one of them happened on the same day EXACTLY 1 month before he was killed, last month on 6/30/13 and the others ranging from around 2 days to 10 days ago, and a list of them since we moved in to this complex.

I'm going to start with the one that really stood out to me and the store clerk, this happened on the same day he was murdered but a month prior on 6/30/13.

It was very late at night, around 2 in the morning. We ran out of bathroom supplies so I made the walk, which is about 5 minutes, literally right across the street. I walked into the store and went to the corner wall near the bathroom where they keep what I needed, it's the only spot in the store that has an ""odd"" feeling, I'm not quite sure how to describe it other than when I walked over there I could feel the environment change.

So I take my stuff up to the counter and all the sudden I see a white cloud figure rush from the wall I just described, dart towards the back of the stores employee section. I froze for a second to process and then looked in the direction to see if a real person was in the store, I was the only one, then I said, ""wow did you just see that?!"" it took her a second to determine if I was nuts or heavily drunk, which I was not, so when she said ""no, what?"" I said ok, I'm not drunk or crazy, but I just saw a white figure run from the wall to the back, you sure you didn't see anything?""

She said ""nooo don't say that I see shit all the time"" (whatever that means) she walked a few feet and took a breath, it was very apparent I had spooked her so I apologized a few times for scaring her. I then took my arm and moved it back and fourth to see if it was some kind of reflection off of the freezers where they store the drinks and quickly tried to duplicate it to no avail. I looked to see if there were cars that pulled in, nothing, 2 am in the morning, no pun intended but it was a ""Ghost Town"" like night, totally silent around our area.

This was one of the most obvious apparitions I have ever seen in my life, actually it's the ONLY one I could actually identify as a legit apparition, as a child I experienced a lot of things in another state on land with very rich history and suicide, but never saw anything with my own eyes like I had just seen.


Let me take you back for a second, for awhile I've been wondering if anything had happened in this area or in my home due to the experiences I've had here and in our complex, so a few months ago I decided to Google it up, this is how I came across the story of the guy that was murdered in my complex. I have had experiences in my unit, which led to me actually set up my webcam on the hallway while I walk to the store, I've only done this twice so far and I caught something on audio falling down from somewhere, which is probably why I stopped setting it up as I kind of just didn't want to know if it got worse. I will see if I still have it, the audio on the net-book I used was really bad but the object falling was very apparent, almost like a loud clapping sound. I may of deleted it due to how bad the recording sounded but I will post edit to update and post if still available. Most experiences happen outside of my unit, which now brings us to recent timing, the next experience, two nights ago.

My computer and desk face a wall and at night I'm able to see shadows of people that walk by due to the streetlight shining through my window, illuminating the wall in front of my computer that sits next to the window. For the past month I've seen what I thought, to be actual people literally rushing by, as if they were running very VERY fast, every time I see these shadows I immediately look out my window and never once find anything. The only ones I find are the slow moving people walking to their vehicles, never have I see the objects that rush by.

Last week my dad was outside, he came back in and said ""maan, that security guard is weird"" (we have a security guard that patrols, she sits in her car until it's time to do her rounds) I never asked what he meant until I had this experience I'm about to explain.

I was sitting at the computer and I saw one of the shadows go past, I looked out and saw nothing, I then looked further to the left to see our security guard, she was slowly walking down the path, something just seemed off about how she was walking so I continued to watch her..

I've made a diagram of our whole area and her path so you can understand what I'm talking about. Sorry for the sloppiness, I don't have the time to do it in Photoshop so I just used paint.

**Diagram**
http://i.imgur.com/jjswxJT.png

I saw the shadow where I've written **HER START** she then walked very.. what I can only describe as ""oddly and control like"" she then walked straight over to the front door of **UNIT #2** stood there not moving an inch, after about 15 seconds she pivoted around, paused and began to walk towards **UNIT #3** I then said ""what is this lady doing, I need to know"" she LITERALLY at the same time my last word ended, turned around, and stared RIGHT at me through my window, all the lights off in my house, no WAY she could have known I was peeking through the blinds. She then proceeded to the **WINDOW** of **UNIT #3** walked right up to the corner of it, stood there for around 10 seconds and walked behind the unit, out of my sight. It wasn't even like she was trying to look inside, she just stood right next to it, not moving. Imagine yourself doing that, security guard or not, walking up to a door and staring at it, then slowly over to a window and doing the same thing, walking so slow it's like you're being controlled. Any normal person, let alone a 40 year old female security guard would have no reason to do this.

I then went back to ask my dad, ""remember when you said the security guard was acting strange? what did you mean by that"" He said.. ""she was up against peoples windows, just acting very odd"" I said ""right on the money, and explained to him I had seen her doing the same exact thing just now, she was moving like a robot, very strange behavior.""


Those are the latest experiences, but we're not even close to the root of this whole thing.

There are after very loud bangs and noises outside of my unit, no explanations, I've looked around, nothing. I'm an extremely observant person, someone could walk behind me while i'm blindfolded with headphones on and I would still know, nothing goes unnoticed by me around here. The car alarms go off every other night for no reason, sometimes 10 min straight until someone notices. (in my conclusion you'll see why all of this is important)

I've seen other people act like our security guard, one night I looked out of my window and saw a guy just standing there, 2-3 am. Not moving an inch, right out in the middle of the parking lot, for 10 minutes, turn and walk off the same way out guard did. Another time I saw a man walking towards the other path in the diagram screaming at the top of his lugs ""AHHHHHH!!"" *5 second pause* ""AHHHHHH!!"" *5 second pause* ""AHHHHH!!!"" then RUN off as fast as he could screaming until his voice faded away as his vocal cords reach maximum throat breaking level towards around the back of my unit. This was a few months after the murder, maybe 5 max.

At least 5 times a month ambulances come here, park right outside of my window next to the path where these experiences have happened, (not always the same person) the most recent was a few days ago, before that a young girl was screaming at the top of her lungs and had to be restrained on the gurney as she was put into the back of the ambulance, screaming and trying to get away for her life it seemed.


Those are the ones that stick out the most, recently (3 months now) I've had what I can only describe as extremely violent ""demonic like dreams"" the most recent 2-3 nights ago, so bad I had to come sleep on the couch because I was scared, 27 year old tough as nails California guy, real thick skin. I woke up and my stomach was in shambles, the fear in my stomach I felt was extremely intense. I get a feeling of ""let me get your attention from these."" One experience that happened recently not sure if paranormal at all, but will mention. I was walking home from the store, a very old lady was trying to cross the street so I ran over there and helped her cross. The next day walking back in the middle of the day on a well trafficked path to the store I found $13 at the exact point I started to run to the lady from, right in front of the store I saw the apparition at. Haven't seen the lady since, but couldn't believe in the middle of the day I was the one that would find this, and at the same place? strange.


**Conclusion:**

Now this is the most important part. First I need to tell you that I have left some experiences out to cut down space and not confuse you, focusing on some of the most telling, these are the tips to the many icebergs I've witnessed in this place and area. I've left out the parts like ""being watched feelings at night when I walk"" ""being followed feelings"" other ""signs"" ""web like feelings"" of electricity some paranormal detectives have shared, like you're walking through webs but there are non. Just a TON of things like this, so I've chosen some of the experiences that are ""well up there"" and down right just not normal in general. 

I always have a skeptic side when something happens 50% Skeptic and 50% Experience. I work on an even level with both cylinders operating when what I believe to be an a paranormal or strange experience of any kind, like the store apparition for instance, I immediately tried to debunk it first. I just don't want what happens here sometimes when others share an experience and have it blamed on imagination, I believe I'm **legitimately** being asked for attention from Quentin, or someone else telling me I can help him. It may even be others around here also but I may be the one that can help the most and he can sense it. I just don't want anyone thinking I'm ""seeing things"" or he's ""believing what his mind is interpreting to his eyes."" If the apparition sighting at the gas station was in the same direction the clerk was facing she may of seen it if it wasn't only for me to see, but the cash register was facing the door while I was facing in the direction of the wall and register.

July 30th is coming up, the anniversary of the death of Quinten. I need to know your opinions, if you think he's still very angry he was murdered and is acting his rage out through others and not passing through to the other side yet. I kind of took the apparition I saw in the store as a sign, him showing me his light, feeling trapped in a corner and wanting to escape, hence the fast running motion I saw of the apparition in the corner, white symbolizing his good heart and intentions. Could he be trying to communicate with me? due to the fact I may be the only person in this area with a ""knowing and interest"" in the paranormal. 

I'm sorry but, it's almost obvious that I saw this apparition at the same day he was murdered here a month prior. All the events leading up to this is almost like one of those ""life tasks"" could I of been lead here to help a lost soul? I feel like I need to help this person move on, my car is broke down right now and I have no transportation and there is a place outside of my town in the country that sells white sage but I can't get there, is there a substitute? locally available at a grocery store maybe? I went out there once a few years ago to check it out, they have a lot of healing stuff, I went for white sage to do around my home just as an experience, 3 years ago, I wasn't THAT into the paranormal as I am now you could say. On his anniversary should I sit on the bench across from our apartments and do some kind of cleansing? I need to know how to protect myself also. It's about 50 feet from his murder.

I'm 26, male, he was 20, so I feel this is another reason he may be trying to grab my attention as we kind of came from a similar lifestyle at one point and are around the same age.

I know this was long but I can't hold all this in, to myself, I legitimately think something is trying to communicate with me or is just lost in general, wondering why no one will give him any attention. 

If you made it this far I really thank you for reading, and if you can, please give some advise and input on what to do.

Thanks everyone.


**UPDATE**

So after writing this I left to go do some work on my dad's friends car, they are in a tight squeeze so we have been helping them out with the car for about a year now no charge.

I came back into the house and my air conditioning was changed from Cool to Auto, the temp was set at 72 and it's right next to the window I talked about earlier, a stand up one, RIGHT before I walked out the door I took it down to 68, put it on Cool and walked out the door, I specifically remember checking the temp and changing it from the 70's where my dad likes it to 68, he walked out the door first after I changed it and I locked the door behind us, I come back and the whole thing is just wrong you would have to hit multiple buttons for this to happen, a sequence. I walk into the kitchen and our stand up mirror is laying on the ground on top of the lunchbox I had it propped up on for height. This is getting bizarre, nothing has happened for a few days until I wrote this post. 

On our way out of the parking lot it was almost like clockwork, the ambulance and firetruck I spoke about pull right in and park right outside the path shown in the diagram, coincidences?

Even my dog is freaking out.,MunchomonFumbleuzar,39,13,35,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1g7kin/heavy_presence_followed_me_even_my_dog_is/,"So, I don't even really know how to explain this. I just moved into my boyfriend's apartment like three months ago. In the house I lived in before, I really felt like there was a presence there. It didn't necessarily feel EVIL, but it definitely had a heavy, watchful feeling to it. My brother, mom, boyfriend, and best friend all told me about how they felt it and their experiences with it separately. I never told any of them how it made me feel or my experiences with it (which I just realized I should probably put on /r/paranormal too). So, I definitely believe that it was real. When I moved, I felt freed from it.

 Fast forward about two months, I was home alone (Zach was at work) and taking a shower. All of a sudden, a large shadow moved from the bathroom door to immediately in front of the shower. I felt a breeze as though someone walked through the bathroom door (hard to explain, but when I'm showering and Zach comes in the bathroom, I always feel a breeze before I actually see him). I pull the curtain, happy that he was home early, but there was no one there. I stood there for a moment shocked, because I felt and saw him/someone come in. I grabbed my towel and walked through the house. No one. I called Zach at work and he picked up the phone. He was sympathetic to my fear, but thought I was just being silly.

Now, I feel it. It comes when I'm alone. Never when Zach is home. We adopted a dog a week ago. When Zach's at work, the dog constantly sits at my feet. He acts like he's protecting me. He growls randomly at nothing and sometimes he cowers in fear, but he never leaves my side. As it gets dark outside, he gets more insistent about staying with me and gets more skiddish around the door to the extra bedroom. Last night, I felt that heavy presence and looked at Bam. He had his back to me, standing between me and something. He was poised to pounce. Not growling really, but non-verbally asserting himself.. towards the extra bedroom. Obviously there was nothing there. I slammed the door to the extra room and took Bam for a walk. We walked to Zach's work (like 1/4 of a mile) and waited for him to get off work. 

Has anyone had experiences like this? Does anyone have any theories on whats happening? I'd love a good solid debunk right about now. I'd love to have someone convince me that I'm just being crazy, but I really don't think I am.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1g7kin,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1g7kin/heavy_presence_followed_me_even_my_dog_is/,
1369242930.0,24,self.Paranormal,1euffh,[Experience] Strange camping trip,Zanki,40,16,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1euffh/experience_strange_camping_trip/,"When I was 14 I went camping in the summer with the girl guides. We only traveled a few miles away to a place we had visited a few times for game nights. Each year, our guides would merge with the two others in the area for a huge camp out for around five days. The place we were staying in was rumored to have a ghost in the main house, the story says it only shows itself to members of the family.

We where staying on the large estate near the woods, right away from the house. I had been there quite a lot and knew the grounds pretty well which was awesome. I was staying in a tent with the younger girls, ranging from aged 10-13 because I didn't have my own tent like the other older girls. The first day and night went smoothly, we built a climbing frame, lit candles in the dark and pretended we had landed on an alien planet (a silly fun game, it is part of the story later). 

The next morning, me and one of the other girls get up early, our groups job was to collect firewood for breakfast, so we ventured into the woods on our own. We where joking around, grabbing wood as we walked. We ended up at the obstacle course and decided to play on it for a while, even though it was out of bounds. When we were done, we grabbed the firewood and started walking back to camp. The woods, to me, they felt and looked strange. It was as if the place was slightly different. I decided to start trying to scare the girl I was with, just messing around, trying to spook her because it was fun. She got spooked and ran off and left me behind. I wasn't bothered as I slowly walked back, that was when I saw movement to my left, then again up ahead. As I was about the leave the woods, I saw a man out of the corner of my eye, he was wearing a white T-shirt and a cap, carrying something long. I think it was a shotgun. There was no one there. I just shrug it off, stuff like that doesn't bother me, I've seen stranger. Once out of the woods, everything goes back to normal, I looked back and the woods where as they should have been, not like they where a few moments ago. I don't know how to explain it, they just seemed newer for a while, not as wild I guess, but everything was kind of grainy, misty I guess, but there was no mist. 

So I don't say anything more, I enjoy the camp out, we play games, sing songs and just have fun. On the second to last day, we play a game. We had landed on the alien planet and once we had breakfast, we had to go hide in the woods, build a shelter, a fire to make food and people had to go steal food from the campsite without being seen. I am left in the woods on my own for ages as the other girls go about getting the food. I build a pretty awesome shelter, but I realised I needed my pen knife which I had left in my tent, so I went to get it. I get to the tent to find the kids I was sharing it with crying their eyes out, terrified. I eventually get the story out of them. They had been making their food when a man, wearing a white shirt and cap had appeared and then vanished in front of them where I had seen him. I assured the kids it was fine and that it couldn't hurt them and they eventually went back into the woods, but they where seriously shaken. I got the blame for telling them a scary story, but I had only tried to scare one girl at the very start and hadn't mentioned anything about the man to anyone. 

That night was the camp fire. As it ended, we all ran through the pitch black woods back to camp, leaving the person looking after us all alone in the woods. She had a light so no big deal. She had to make sure the fire was out. I found out a week after that she had been terrified walking back to camp and refused to go into the woods again after that. She has refused to camp at that site ever since, but she won't tell us what she saw. 

The last day, I got bored packing up, after everything that had happened, I was in a ghost hunting mood. So me and two other girls go into the woods. I'm in the lead and I'm walking along a path. I stopped walking and hear footsteps in front of us. Clear footsteps walking on dead leaves, but there where none. No one was walking anywhere near us. I followed the sounds along a path, someone had heavy boots on, it was so strange. We all had trainers on. The girls I was with were silent, they could hear it as well. I followed the sounds around to a clearing at the very edge of the woods were it stopped. I decide to sit down on the grass, the other girls followed me, but they sat behind me because they were scared at this point. I do the whole ""if there is anyone here, can you give me a sign"" routine. As I finished, a white mist suddenly fell over the woods, you could see things moving behind it, nothing clear. It hung in the air as the other two girls ran off screaming. I sat for a minuted and watched it, before saying ""thank you"". As I said this, it was like a gust of wind hit and it was gone. There was no wind. It was just awesome. 

That was the last of the strange stuff for that camp. We had to finish packing up and left the camp that afternoon. I've been back a few times since and nothing strange has happened, the woods have always felt normal since then.

A few years after that, I found out that I am actually related to the family who owned the house and estate. I'm always curious if the activity picked up because I was staying in the grounds.

Here's the whole story-

A few years ago, I lived in a apartment with my cousin. It was on the second floor of a two story house, with other tenants living on the first floor and in the basement. The house was in an urban area and was about 100 years old from what we knew.

Shortly after we moved in we starting hearing things. The ""living room"" area was right up against the stairwell leading to our apartment. Often when we were sitting in there, we would hear the very clear and discernible sound of someone entering the door from the street on the first floor, close the door behind them, and start up the stairs. They would walk right up to the door of our apartment and the footsteps would just go away. This happened every day, most often early in the morning but at all hours. Many times I'd be laying in my bed with my girlfriend and the sound would wake her up. I went and checked a few times and there was never anybody there. One I heard what sounded like a man say ""hey,"" like from the top of the stairs and into the apartment. No one was there. Many people heard this and we eventually started to joke about the ghost. The door at the top of the stairs led into the kitchen, and another thing that happened a few times was that you would hear the person coming up the steps, the sound would go away, and then things would start falling in the kitchen. Like, a loaf of bread would fall off the counter or something would fall off the top of the fridge.

The incident I'm wondering about happened only one time but I remember it clearly. My cousin always woke up earlier than I did to go to work. The door into the stairwell didn't close properly and would remain open unless you forced it shut. I woke up one morning and went to drain the lizard. As I walked into the kitchen(the bathroom was off the kitchen), I saw a dog in the apartment. It was a big fluffy white dog, kinda like a Samoyed. It just rounded the corner from the living room, through the kitchen, and out into the stairwell without even looking at me or acknowledging me in any way. My only thought at the time was ""great, my cousin left the door open and now there's a dog in the apartment."" I went to pee, listening to see if the dog would walk down the stairs. Didn't hear anything. Finished, went out to find the dog. It was gone. There was no where it could have gone but down the stairs. And let me be clear, this is a pretty small, old building- I would have been able to hear a dog this size going down that many steps. It was really, really creepy. I just got back into bed and didn't tell my girlfriend because she would've been freaked out.

Anyone ever seen anything like this before or heard of it happening?

**TL;DR** I saw a ""ghost dog,"" or a ghost decided to manifest as a dog, I guess.

Some background about the location - This is in an Asian country, a small one BHK house, row of houses lined on either side of the street and backside of the houses was 
sort of abandoned area and next to it a railway track, and beyond that forest.
My parents had moved to this location newly, as my dad got transferred to this new place and rented this place to stay. As everything was in a hurry there was no time for proper inquiry about the place and it was really difficult to get a place to stay within a short period of time. So we were four, my parents, my elder sister, she was four yo and I was one.
My mom was not having a job at that time and staying home taking care of us kids. 

This was the very first night at that new house. So at night around nine my dad left for work, and mom put us kids to bed. At around ten my mom was in the kitchen washing utensils and she starts hearing this wired sound from the backside of the building from the railway track side. The front door was open and she thinks it maybe some thieves or something so goes across the hall to close the door. As she reaches the front door from the hall she sees someone standing right in front of the door in a long white dress. It was the figure of a woman with long hair across her face and standing there looking down and not showing her face. My mom calls out and asks who is it but no response from the women. She is just standing there without moving. And behind her is the dark street outside. Of course there are houses nearby but as it was a new place and around ten at night she didn't know what to do and was scared as hell. The woman stood there like that for some time with no movement at all. And my mom didn't dare go near her and couldn't go in as she needed to close the front door. She went back into the kitchen and grabbed a knife in order to scare her or for self defense I don't know, but when she came back there was no one standing there. She took this opportunity and ran and locked the door and came back to bedroom where we were sleeping. There was a window on the bedroom side which was facing the railway track side, but was closed. 

After some time she starts hearing this paper shuffling type of sound from other side or the window. And smell of kerosene. This sound continued long into the night and she couldn't sleep and was scared.Somehow she made it through the night and next day morning she straightaway went to the house owner who stayed in the neighboring house and asked and told about her experience the previous night.

The guy told the people who stayed there earlier had experienced similar events and that his wife had committed suicide in that house couple of years ago using paper and kerosene to burn herself to death. It seems the husband was out on the street when this happened and ran inside when he heard the screams and tried to save her from the fire. but it was too late and she died. His hands had marks from the burn he got while trying to save his wife. 
Needless to say, we shifted from that house to a different place that week itself.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_14x49x,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/14x49x/something_that_happened_thirtyfive_years_ago/,

A marine was on my tour and he stood in a corner I was told was haunted with an ""evil energy."" I was having a hard enough time accepting ghosts let alone psychic phenomena. The marine was pulled to the ground as he stood in the corner. He said that the energy was following him all over the basement after that. I told him to go get some fresh air and stand outside for a bit. he said, ""No, are you kidding!? This is to much fun!"" and he went to stand in the corner where he was again grabbed.

 There was an archaeological dig at the house a few years back and the house was built on top of a mass grave for British revolutionary war soldiers. The Brits were killed in 1779 and buried in a mass grave. We are told to explain that the father of the original owner of the house killed one with a cannonball. Well after this i did a little research and found the marines were founded in 1775. The marines and the Brits were at war when the British soldier died.

It is my conclusion that the ""evil energy"" in the corner is a frightened British soldier and that he attacked because his enemy stepped into his turf. ",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_vzpvl,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/vzpvl/second_post_about_the_ghosts_where_i_work_i/,

Alright, I finally got proof of something pretty crazy going on in my dorm. A lot of stuff has been moving around in my room ever since I moved in last semester, and I am the only one with keys! I confess, I nearly thought I was going crazy for a bit there, but now I know it isn't just me. 

For the past few days, I have been leaving my computer running every time I leave my room. I setup my web-cam to take photos once every second to see if I can catch someone (or something!) coming in my room and going through my stuff. What I found was amazing.

The image in the link is a segment of 6 frames that I pulled from the program after having gone out to eat dinner last week. In the first few frames everything is normal but then you can clearly see something in the process of moving my towel. By the next second, my towel has been moved a few feet over, and the creature is gone. I have no idea what this thing is, but whatever it is, it can't be human because no one could move that fast.

I really want to take summer classes, but I am too scared to sleep in my room now. Ever since I saw this last week I have been sleeping in my friend's room, but he is going home for the summer, so I am going to be screwed if I can't figure this out soon.

If anyone thinks they know what this could be, how to make it leave me alone, or has any information about this, please get in touch with me. I am getting kind of desperate!

We couldn't drink at home because of our parents and the streets were not always a good place with cops harassing. We found a cemetery was the solution. We would go there and get drunk at night without any harassment. We only went there at night when the place closed and all we had to do was climb the gates. One particular winter night my friend and I had two girls with us. We were drinking and decided to get some privacy, so he went one way with his girl and me and mine went the other. 

I was making out with the girl and things started getting interesting when we heard foots steps. It was a cold winter night so there was some snow on the ground and the grass was crisp. The foot steps seemed to be heading towards us so we got startled. We stopped what we were doing and I assured her that it was probably our friends trying to see what we were up too.

I followed the sound of the foot steps to try and see what was really causing them. The foot steps were getting closer and I still did not see anyone. The sound of dry grass crushing under their weight with a pause between steps was an unmistakable sound of foot steps. The sound was so close that I should have seen who was causing them by now. They kept getting closer and at this point I stopped walking towards the sound and made sure I was still within view of my girl.

The steps halted directly infront of me and there was nothing there. I could not believe my eyes and maybe it was the darkness so I swept my arms infront of me in a scissor like motion to see if I could touch anything, but nothing was there. I carefully walked backwards with my neck hair standing on ends and colder than I have ever felt. I kept walking backwards until I found the courage to turn around. Turning away was like embracing death. Even though I could not see what was there I felt that turning my back was like inviting it to do as it pleased. I walked towards my girl probably pale and managed to still lie to her. I told her it was my friend checking on us and I told him we were fine but we were leaving.

(wall of text)",clue124,34,9,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/pktgv/esp_ufos_and_ghosts_my_experiences_wall_of_text/,"To start off, I wasn't always superstitious. When I was little I was very gullible and I was never told why to avoid black cats or walking under ladders but I did anyway.  Also, I believed seeing the air/objects move and unusual things in the sky were normal (until I grew up of course).

When I was very young living in military house in South Korea, my brother and myself had this ""sense"" where we could ""hear"" people approaching or close by.  I can't describe it exactly but if you think of the static white noise that televisions make when the volume is set to zero, that is what we could ""hear"".  Up until I was about 6 or 7 we would never be able to be caught off guard unless it were already very loud.  It was very convenient for us siblings when we wanted to stay up late because we could hear this ""noise"" as soon as our parents woke up.  But that wasn't even it.  Sometimes we would both suddenly hear this ""noise"" in our doorway and both suddenly look towards the doorway of our room to see a figure that we mistook for our mother but would fade away.  After several years we could not hear the white noise anymore but we still remember how it felt when we could ""hear"" it.

The same house, like I mentioned before that I would see this figure in the doorway.  Just remembering it freaks me out now.

Still the same house, I was always annoyed that whenever I was alone I would have random little objects land on my head.  Dominoes, keys, coins, thimbles, maybe even food would just hit my head like it fell on me.  I asked my parents several times why I was falling into their traps where they would drop things on me and they would just laugh and change the subject.

After a night from having a babysitter over, our parents returned from their dinner and my brother and myself ran outside our house to see a disk-like object appear in the sky with some unusual blinking blue and red ""spotlights.""  The object suddenly blinked with a blue flash and was gone.  We both freaked out to share the story with our parents to no success.  Later that year, I suddenly woke up to see blue and red flashing lights outside my window.  Thinking it were police lights I went to inspect the flashing and as soon as I peeked through my curtains I saw no police cars but up in the sky was a giant chrome oval shaped colossus.  It let off an unusual aura and it had those red and blue spotlights blinking from it.  I quickly closed the curtains and looked back at my brother who also woke up to see my surprised look and suddenly there was the blue flash and it was gone.

One Halloween, a group of high school kids in the neighborhood got their hands on a pair of bolt cutters to break into an abandoned train station office building.  Upon inspection we could see at the end of the main door hallway was a desk with a picture frame and a few other objects.  I could not confirm whether this were a prank or not but nonetheless it freaked me out.  Later that night the highschoolers had gathered everyone who was daring to go exploring and we left to the train station.  The bolt cutters were used and as soon as we opened the main doors, all the window shutters in the entire building shut and the desk at the end of the hallway ignited and the picture frame turned around.  The picture was just of a red car and probably held no significance other then the fact that it flipped around.  Needless to say, we all shit ourselves and scattered.
The next day, we all went to check the building and all the doors and windows into the building were boarded up.

I don't have any fancy dialogue, I'm just going to tell the story straight up. 

* Since age 8, I had been complaining about something being with me in my room. I would complain and whine for a few nights but my parents shrugged it off and made me sleep in there. They thought it was just a 'phase'. It wasn't. 

* At age 9 (I had managed to ignore the eerie feeling I had) I was sleeping in my room, but I knew something was up. I quickly hid under my quilt and peeked out to see if anything was there. I noticed my closet was open, and it wasn't before (it looks like [this](http://www.executivemirror.com/Designer_Series/mirage-white%20lami.JPG) and they slide left or right). But I did not hear or see it open. So I told my mom, and she said I had probably left it open. I knew I hadn't, but I figured it would be a one time occurrence. Days pass and it happens again. I wake up to find it open. In the middle of the night as well. It's as if whatever was doing it was toying with me. Me, being scared, crept to sleep in my younger brother's room where I felt safe. 

* At age 10, I was walking passed my sister's room with laundry and one of her dolls (I will defend this with my life) was THROWN across the room. And it didn't just fall, because when I told my mom what happened and she came up to check it out, the doll was more that 2 feet away from where it originally was. I still can't forget that. Something was trying to hurt me. 

* Months pass and I work up the courage to sleep in my own room, but the first night I do, I get that feeling again, but decide to sleep with my lights on. I go to sleep. When I wake up in the middle of the night, I hear something slam. I looked to see what it was and one of my model planes I had was broken into several pieces on the floor. Not only was I shitting bricks, I was pissed off. I have no doubt in my mind it liked that. Determined, I slept in the room one more night, but had my parents check the closet (that's where I thought the monster was) and there was nothing. I figured it had left because I slept good that night. 

* I slowly built up confidence to face the monster, if it ever showed itself. I would insult it (calling it out, saying it was scared, etc.) but actually I was the scared one. A few nights later I wake up in the middle of the night (that's usually when shit went down) and I knew something was up. I had lost all the bravado in me and all of my skin color when I look above my covers to see an eye. A fucking eye. My closet was cracked open maybe 3 centimeters on the right side, and on the lower portion there was an eye. Just looking at me. I wanted to scream, but I waited for something to happen. I thought I was crazy. Just as I was thinking this, the eye went from looking at me over to the left side of my room. It just stared at a small table I had there. After what felt like an eternity the eye just vanished. Now I knew I was crazy. I never told anyone because I didn't want them to think I was a nut, so from then until 6-7 months after this I would sleep in my brothers room so we could 'save money on our energy bill'. My parents didn't mind. 

* After that incident shit started to get worse. I was alone at my house. My brother was in karate and my sister was in ballet. I never had a fear of being alone in my house, but tonight was different. I would feel like someone was just watching me there in my vulnerable state. I would refrain from going into other rooms because it felt like if I did there would be consequences. The fear got so intense that I called my mom and told her I'm really scared of the house. She told me she would be home so so we could talk and see what was going on. When she got there and we went around the house, nothing was different and I told her how I felt and she understood. She said she went through something similar at my age when she thought she was seeing things. So I said I'd be fine knowing it's just me and not anything else. 

* 2 months pass and I get relatively comfortable staying alone at the house. Again, my brother was at karate and my sister at ballet. I was sitting down doing my homework in our living room and a sudden chill hits me. I look around and everything normal, but my dog was in her cage and she never goes there unless we put her in. I ignored it and continued doing my work, when all of a sudden books from the near-by shelf. They just fall flat on the floor. Unprovoked. I couldn't move. I was in shock. I called my mom as fast as I could and told her to help me. She was getting annoyed of this happening but came home anyway and said that it was just a one time thing. The books could have fallen because they weren't steady. I was getting annoyed with my mom, because she didn't believe that something was targeting me. So I stopped telling her weird things that happened to me, but not much else did until I was 14. 

* This scarred me for life. I was in my bed, and I woke up in the middle of the night (I even remember the time.. 3:06) and I was wide awake. I kept tossing and turning, and for one odd reason or the other, I started singing [this song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1TsfShR5ZY). I don't know why, and those of you who want to laugh can, but it's what I did. I started singing it louder and louder and then I stopped remembering things. Our maid said she heard me singing and came in my room to see of I was alright. She said we had a normal conversation and I said I needed to get my sleep. The last thing I remember I quickly turned on my side and I could not move. I remember the last thought I had was the words 'you wouldn't'. I couldn't move my arms, legs, hands, feet. Nothing. Then the bed started shaking. That thing I had been fearing finally attacked. And then it all stopped. I could move again, but I knew it would come back for more. I screamed bloody murder and my parents rushed in and I told them what happened. They told me that sounded demonic (us being Christians, that thought had always been in the back of our minds) and they quickly got their Bibles and started to pray over me. I don't remember what happened after that. But I came to and my dad was standing up and tears were pouring out of my mothers eyes. I asked them what was wrong and what happened, and they said I had been yelling in what sounded like a hateful rant of something in another language for 5 minutes. I couldn't believe it. I still ask her to this day to explain it to me because I have no memory of it. I now have a scar where I felt the demon press against me. I will upload a pic if you want. I'll even go to a before and after for the skeptics. This is my first time telling anyone, so please be kind. Nothing like this has happened since then.

* TL;DR: There is none. It's all pretty important.

* Edit: Thanks for all your comments :) You all are so nice.

Alright so I was streaming with my friends last night Starcraft II, and all of a sudden I hear like a little girls voice. It is around 12 at night, so everyone is asleep, no one was in the room with my. One of my friends had his brother in the room (who is 15, and has a relatively deep voice for his age), but I was the only one who heard the sound, and it sounds like it came from my mic/computer or something. So when I started joking around about it being a ghost or something, my friend went back after the stream to listen cause he didnt believe me. He then found multiple times it seems a little girl/boy speaks. One time he/she clearly says ""Can you hear me"". I did not hear any instances except the one where I freak out, the majority of the others happen when I leave the computer to grab a midnight snack. Here are the times it happens: 1:02:02, 1:02:13, 102:18, 102:47, 103:14, 103:59 and finally the one I hear is 104:20.


102:02 - Weird moaning sort of sound 

102:13 - ""hey everybody"" 

102:18 - no clue 

102:47 - Muffled attempt at talking? 

103:14 - ""can you hear me"" 

103:59 - sounds like ""Michael"" 

104:20 - ""i can... weird noise""



After 104:20 I kinda start to joke around, was not serious about being a ghost. They didnt hear it, it was just me. Our skype call with Coolaid began at 12:03am, I have a screen cap of my skype to confirm this. Chandler disconnected when a lot of this went on.

I am thinking maybe you guys can slow down the audio so we can make out more clearly what the speech is.

I'm very new to reddit but thought this might be an interesting read for the paranormal addicts like myself.  About 5 years ago, I did a semester abroad at my school's castle in the Netherlands.  There was always chatter about it being haunted (by a ghost named Sophie) but I never really took it seriously being a bit of a skeptic and all.  The story goes that the castle is haunted by the ghost of a young girl named Sophie who will open and close doors, turn lights on and off - typical ghost behavior.  One night I got into my bed and the SECOND I turned the lights off, it was as if someone was right by my ear struggling to breath and just about choking.  I freaked out and turned the light back on but no one was there.  Since people always ask - I was not drunk or stoned or anything like that.  I turned the light off again and it happened again.  I jumped off that bunk bed so fast and ran to sleep in another room.  The next morning I told the RA what had happened and he told me it had happened to students in the past as well.  There was a rumor that Sophie died from tuberculosis when she was 19 which would make all of the sense in the world seeing as you basically choke to death with that disease.  I've had small weird things happen to me since but nothing as unexplainable as this.

Little quick backstory, my wife &amp; child live with her elderly Grandma. The house was built on a plot of many track homes. Her Grandpa died in the house. Ok. 

So almost every night at 3-3:30am I wake up. Complete silence except the air conditioner and fan. I put my headphones on and watch some ASMR videos on YouTube and try to go back to sleep. But some nights I'm awoken by a touch. It could be on my leg, back,head etc. like last night for instance, I felt someone rubbing my leg really slow then it stopped, then it sat right next to me on the bed. You could feel the weight drop down and everything, that's when I sat up and looked around. The weight never left. But somehow it wasn't there anymore. 

There's been other times when this happens in the middle of the day. One time I was laying down messing with my phone and something licked my leg by my ankle. But it didn't feel like a normal tongue, it was rough and prickly like a dogs tongue. I immediately got
up and checked my ankle and it was dry. But I totally felt it get licked. My friend told me there's entity's that take form as a Dog and that those are most likely demons.

A little background: My husband and I moved into our apartment about a year ago. The building is about 100 years old and on a main street downtown. I reaserched my block and what I found was that in the early 1900s, a house was where my parking lot is now. As storefronts were built, they were attached to the house. When the structures were compromised by the stress, the house was torn down (says an article). After a murder took place, the house was torn down and the lot was built (says the guy who tore it down). In my apartment, an older lady with multiple health problems died after having a heart attack and being taken to the hospital. 
Outside my door, there is a little breezeway that only connects to the 3 apartments and goes to the lot and street. Im on the end by the street, the middle tenants were old and never left, and a guy lives on the end nearest the parking lot. Peroidically, I hear running (like children) in my breezeway and several times I have opened the door and no one has been there or anywhere near. After asking the guy at the end who runs around up here, he told me its no one; he hears it, but when he looks, there's no one there (at this point, I hadn't told him I had looked before and saw no one). My kitchen cabinets open and close on their own, and sometimes I have to leave the kitchen because a presence is so strong behind me. One morning after my husband went to work, I was laying in bed and something patted my shoulder.  
Whatever this is seems to be somewhat friendly and I've adopted the philosophy that as long as it leaves me alone, I will leave it alone, but I can't help but feel a little freaked out by something else sharing my home. I've burned sage all around and it seems to calm down for a few days, but it always comes back. I feel like it's a child, a woman, or both. My husband thinks I'm a nut; he's a huge skeptic. 
What else do I do? Whether its advice on helping it calm down, or advice on helping me calm down, anything is appreciated.

The last one I had was a few years ago when I was dating a guy named Skyler and it was about his car getting robbed and him getting shot. It happened 2 years later, he heeded my warnings and all went ok. The one I had last night.....was scary to say the least. My husband and I were standing in our driveway talking. Then out of nowhere, a person parachuting in the sky flew very low over our house, like the wind caught him. When he landed, the strongest wind I have ever felt (yes, I could feel it.) started up. It was so forceful the houses around us blew over and fell apart. After the wind ended, we just both kind of blankly stared at each other like ""WTF just happened?"". That is when we heard a HUGE explosion ( seemed more like a collision, like every plane just fell from the sky.) happened and I could see huge chunks of rock flying up into the air, followed by a tidal wave of lava. Without a word, we both ran towards the back yard. My husband got ahead of me and then I woke up. This dream, was so friggen real and happened in like 2 mins. Scared the crap out of me.

Has anyone ever experienced something similar? Do any of you have regular premonitions that come true and could give me some details on them? This is only the second time this has happened to me and I am a pretty worried about it. Even if you could just confirm that I am crazy or something, that would be helpful too. Thank you in advance and please, be gentle. I am baring my soul here and I do not tell people about these for fear of negative judgement. 

Edit: While I am aware I have no proof of the dream I had last night, I would also like to say that I am not looking for validation, more like an explanation and advice. This is why I do not see the need for me to provide proof at this moment. If I can find a way to prove it, I will. This is a self post, I am not getting karma for it, I am only looking for a place to at least, get all of this out of my head. I am saying this because someone decided something I said here warranted downvoting everything I have ever posted. I was not trying to trick or anger you, I apologize. Please, if you dislike my post or comments, just move on. Thank you, guys. 

Edit 2: I tried to look up online police logs to prove the incident at King Richard's faire, but I would have to put in a request as they only put daily records online. I will continue to try and provide proof. Suggestions for it? Please share them.

It was pleasant and we we're standing outside the family home (which has been in the family for 36 years), bright beautiful day. He told me that on my birthday (and it was my birthday) that he would visit me every year. In reality he didn't visit me in my dreams and was only that one time. The second, again in the family home. He was sitting in a casket with his eye sown together as my grand mother was showing him a picture album, he then after sat up in his coffin and it was bloody terrifying so I proceed to wake the fuck up. haha. 



My second experience, was a lot more vivid. My uncle (who died at the young age of 42) I had a dream that was very similar to the ones my mother and aunts had of him. He was walking up the stair (once again in our family home) with a presence of whiteness behind him. It was very peaceful and told us all that he loved us and told me to remind my aunt(his wife) the same. Eventually I had another dream of him sitting on a couch with my dad drinking beers like they use to, but he looked at me with a strange look. Like I was the only one in the room who knew he was dead. He kept looking at me in the corner of his eye. It was creepy but It is always a pleasure the be in his presence.   

The reason our family home was so important, was because all members of our family have lived in that house at point or another. It was ours. And was somewhat haunted from what I've heard.

Are you there.,patchy911,39,11,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/zzske/mom_are_you_there/,"I have recently posted a video on /r/Paranormal and when I did I wasn't really sure about the type of stuff submitted to this page.  Well after looking at some posts I figured I'd share a story of something that happened when I was 18 and my family and I moved into a new house.  I apologize in advance for the long post.

We had moved into this house about 3 months before the incident.  Our family consisted of myself, my mother and step father, my brother (age 14), and my sister (7).  The house is a single story with 4 bedrooms, 2 on 1 side, the master bedroom and a small room next to it which belonged to me.  On the other side of the house were the other 2 rooms and in between was the living room kitchen an office area and the laundry room.  My room was in the front left side and my little sisters was in the back right.  Sorry about the detail just feels needed.  Now to the actual story lol.

It was 3:09 one night and everyone was sound asleep when I'm woken up but a little girls voice faintly saying ""Mooooom"".  It wasn't a quick 'Mom' like people usually say but the way someone would say it when calling for someone in the distance or one they can't find.  I roll over and look at my clock and sit up my bed wondering if I had heard what I thought I heard.  Maybe it was just a dream that I was having and surely If I waited I would hear either my sister calling for my Mom or nothing and I would go back to sleep knowing it was a dream.  I sat there listening for a few minutes and after hearing nothing I laid back down.  Within 30 seconds of me closing my eyes I hear ""MOOOOM are you there?, this time louder sounding as if it was right outside my parents door and mine.  I jump out of bed to see what my sister wants or needs and am greeted with darkness.  I have an instant feeling of uneasiness and I quickly walk over to my sisters room to see what was going on.  When I opened the door to my sisters room I stood in the doorway for a few seconds and said her name.  After getting no response I went over to her bed and said her name louder while seeing if she was sleeping.  She was sound asleep.  I made my way back to my room very confused.  As I reached my door my mother opened hers.  She walks out to me not wanting to wake my step father, and asks me did ""Lucy"", made up name, just call for me.  My jaw dropped! ""You heard it too?"" I asked her.  Yea she called for me twice I was getting dressed to go check on her she said.  I told my mom that I had just come from her room I had heard the same thing but Lucy is sound asleep!  Without saying a word we both knew what we had just heard, we looked at each other and I watched her cautiously, best word I can think of, make her way back to her room looking around.  I slowly made my way back to bed and didn't hear anything else.

Two months later we were driving down a back road that we had never drove on because our neighborhood had just connected to it giving it 2 entrances so we thought we see what was back that way.  We turned out of our neighborhood and about a mile down the road we see a plaque, a nice one, on the side of the road.  We pulled over to see what it said and read something like this, 'In 1702 a massacre of the Apalachee Indians happened on this site.  Men, Women and Children were slain without remorse.  We hope that they find peace in the after life that was unreachable on this planet.

1340846478.0,26,self.Paranormal,vpt8i,Mysterious Message From Beyond? Please help me understand what happened to my dad. (Cross-post from /r/christianity),betteporter,46,20,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/vpt8i/mysterious_message_from_beyond_please_help_me/,"Here's what happened to my dad yesterday:

First, a little background: My dad is a Christian, as am I. In terms of the paranormal, I have typically believed that ghosts, aliens, and the like have a demonic nature. I particularly believe that demonic entities can take the form of ""familiar spirits"", in which they take on the identity of a deceased loved one. My mom passed away in 2008, and ever since, my dad has experienced some strange happenings in his house. But what happened yesterday has me baffled.

My dad was awoken yesterday morning a few minutes early by one of his dogs. So, he got up, went downstairs, made himself a cup of coffee, and settled in to watch the local news. He heard an unfamiliar cell phone ring, which he assumed was coming from the tv. He thought it strange that the news anchor seemed to be unbothered by it. The station went to a commercial break, and the ringing continued. Convinced that it must be his own cell phone, my dad walked into the kitchen to answer it. His phone was not ringing, and there were no missed calls. On his way back into the living room, he caught glimpse of a flashing light in the tv cabinet. It was coming from my mom's old cell phone that he keeps next to her ashes. It was ringing. Weird? Yes. Why? #1: the phone has been disabled/unregistered for over 4 years now. #2: I was the last person to have the phone on (this past Christmas), and I turned it off when I was done looking at it. #3: even if I hadn't turned it off, the battery would have run down by now, seeing as how Christmas was 6 months ago. Now... here's where it gets weirder: My dad decides to open the phone, and he sees a message in black text on a white square background.

It simply said: ""God is good.""

My dad claims that it opened just like a text message, and had no phone number or name attached to it... just the words: ""God is good.""

Now, my dad is a lot of things... but crazy is not one of them. He is a sane man, and I 100% believe that this happened to him. But how? Do you guys really think this could be a message from my mother? Or perhaps simply God's way of comforting my father? I honestly don't know what to believe.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_vpt8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/vpt8i/mysterious_message_from_beyond_please_help_me/,

Me and my sister were in my bedroom watching tv, when an advertisement came on, we were talking, the way i was facing her looked straight out my window. I saw something emitting blue light hovering around, silent, not a noise. My sister also watched. At first it was flat going slowly to the side, then it turned around and went the other way, then repeated a few times. When it turned it went on it's side, allowing me to clearly see the shape of the object, triangular, with a smaller triangle on the bottom - connected as one. It was blackish in appearance with the blue glow.

After it did the turns, it just went..BANG..Silent, but it left so fast you couldn't see it.

Here's the weird thing. What this means, I don't know, maybe one of you could help me out...Within 2 minutes of seeing this, i felt light headed, and i saw a massive meteorite crashing into the earth, like it was really happening, i was 100% awake, un drugged, like a premonition kind of thing. I went out and ran to my nan.

To this day no-one believes me, even my sister says it was a plane or something? How could a plane move like that?!

My earliest encounter with the paranormal happened when I was around seven years old. At the time I was living in a waterfront home that was built in the 1950s. Like most old homes it would creak, shift and make the occasional odd noise.

I was a superstitious and meticulous seven year old. I had a regimen before going to bed. Al the lights would be on, my door slightly open (2ft), and I would sleep on my side facing the wall. I had a giant window facing the backyard and at night it would always scare the shit out of me. I always felt something or someone was looking at me in the backyard. 

On one particular night I saw what could only be described as a black silhouette in my room. For no apparent reason I woke up in the middle of the night and shot up into a sitting position. In front of me at the base of my bed was a black figure. It was a two-dimensional silhouette of a man. It was not transparent but simply black and around the edges everything was distorted (almost wavy). I wanted to scream yet I could do nothing. I sat there paralyzed and that's all I remember. I don't even remember going back to bed. In fact, I don't remember anything after seeing the black distorted figure. I woke up the next day with this horrible memory that I didn't want to share with anyone. It was only 19 years later that I told my mother. She later confided to me that she experienced something similar in that house. 

**Second experience**


The second time I had an encounter with the paranormal was when I was attending university. I was living in a townhouse with two other friends. From the moment I moved in I felt this feeling of dread. It was so unsettling living there. There was this aura of evil that permeated throughout the house no matter where you were. Since we were students we were cheap and decided not to buy blinds for the living room. We had two big windows facing a forest as a backyard. At night, it felt pretty weird sitting in the living room watching TV and seeing nothing but black. But you got use to it. 

In order to properly tell the story I need to set up the scenario. I was in my living room and the television was on. The windows facing the backyard were completely fogged due to the cold of winter and me forgetting to take the pot off the stove. I had just finished eating spaghetti and was watching my favorite show of the time, CSI Las Vegas. I returned to the kitchen to wash my dishes and to take the pot off the stove. Five minutes later I returned to the couch to watch some more. Keep in mind that my television was in front of the window and we had no curtains or blinds. The windows were completely fogged similar to mirror after a hot shower. After several minutes of couch surfing I noticed something behind the television. My eyes slowly moved from the t.v. to the window and I completely shat a fucken brick. On the window were fresh imprints of a hand being dragged across the entire diameter of the window. The moisture was dripping from the imprints of the hand cascading across the surface. I could hardly believe what I was seeing. I got up and moved closer and realized I wasn't dreaming or hallucinating from the Ragu. I bolted out of the door and crashed at my friends house that night. In the morning I returned and told both my roommates what had happened. Neither of them believed me and laughed it off.

 ~~Two~~ Three most memorable:

The first one was when I was younger, twelve or so. I used to go to my friends house, a place where even the ""adults"" would comment on the house just feeling weird.  Her parents were out one day, and we went to hang out in the downstairs suit (not rented at the time), attached to the house. We weren't allowed to be down there. Which is why we went, of course. 
Before her parents came home we came back upstairs to continue to play and hang, and we thought we heard rummaging going on downstairs, but were to scared to look. 
Her parents came an hour or so later, and I guess had gone downstairs for some reason. They came and asked us if we had gone downstairs, we confessed. And her parents started yelling at us for leaving the place a complete disaster. We told them we had left it the same because we didn't want to get caught, and they then asked us how it became such a mess? We went and looked and it looked like someone had thrown a party. We said at some point we thought we heard someone down there, and her parents investigated, nothing was stolen, the doors and windows locked. It was weird. They grounded us anyway

**TL;DR - Played downstairs at a friends place, left it clean as to not get caught, her parents came home, yelled at us for making a disaster, we had nothing to do with it**

My boyfriend, a friend and myself went to visit another friend in a place he was living/working. The owner of it was the daughter of the man who built it. He had built it deep in the woods on an island, and had spent most of his later years in life designing and building it, knowing he would eventually pass it on to his daughter. His heart and soul.

At the time, the daughter and her boyfriend were visiting family in the States, so the four of us had the giant house to ourselves. 

The friend who was living there, David, told us to pick a room. My boyfriend and I chose a room with a view of the forest and a balcony. 

That night at dinner, I told David how the house just seemed weird. Gave me the shivers. And he laughed and said, ""Well, it's haunted."" He went on to tell us about things flying at people who disrespected the house and lights going on and off at their own will. Other things that spook you. I thought David was pulling our legs, as he has a tendency to do so. As he finished his tales, and the four of us were rolling cigarettes to go outside for a smoke, there were distinct footsteps from the stairs before us. We all looked, saw nothing. David laughed, said ""I told you."" And the rest of us gave our fair shares of ""what the fucks?!?!?!"" and nervous laughter.
We returned, the lights for the stairs to the basement were on, along with the basement lights. We had all been outside. Odd.
David informed my boyfriend and I that we had chosen the old mans room, with his secret study above us.
My boyfriend and I were kept awake most of the night with the sounds of shuffling papers a scuffling. Rats, maybe or something.

The next morning my boyfriend and I slept in. As we were lying in bed trying to laugh off the night before, we heard a smokers cough from in the house. We heard it periodically for about a half hour, assuming it was the other two boys. We got up, to an empty house. 
The boys showed up an hour later, said they had been out in the woods since about 9 that morning doing some of Davids work trade for living there, three hours before we had woken up. We asked David if anyone else would have been in the house. He said the carpenter working on a shed outside. We had seen him drive up as we were getting out of bed. Odd things continued to happen while we were there, but nothing as notable as those.

**TL;DR - Visiting a friend out in the woods, claims house is haunted, spooky things like footsteps, lights, rummaging, and coughing happened**



Yeah, my grandparents old place. I used to live with them on and off for years. Through the ages of 4-10. The same town as the first story.

A lot of disconnected things would happen.

In the younger years, five through eight probably: I firmly belived that Santa existed and elves were real because every year November through December I'd frequently see small people I can only describe as spektors. Faint, white, small people sitting in my grandpas room, which was also the computer room. Where most of the creepy shit would happen. They wouldn't stick around long, I'd get a glimps, have time to register what I saw, and then they'd be gone. I never felt threatened.

Things in my granpa's room would often just fall off of things, and I remember always seeing impressions of a person sitting or laying down, even after I'd straighten out the bed. Almost like a test, I'd straighten the bed out to see if the impression would be there later. They usually were. This also didn't really scare me, it seemed like a game.

One time in particular in my grandpas room I was on the computer playing dress-up dolls. Don't know if you young girls ever played thoughs, but essentially you'd dress up girls in clothes on the computer. This time in particular when I went on a certain site, a girls voice, rather loudly said something like ""Do you have to play that again?"" It freaked me out, and i refreshed the page to see if it would do it again, thinking it was something that happened when you logged on. It didn't happen again, and I checked the speakers, which were turned low. I left the room, the only time I felt really spooked. Perhaps because I was a little older.

The lights in my room would inexplicably be turned on when I'd wake up in the middle of the night. I used to get mad at my grandparents thinking they checked on me and would forget to turn off the light. After numourous times of them saying they hadn't even checked on me, I eventually just accepted it.

My grandma went to Scotland once, and it was just my grandpa and I in the house. I woke up just at dawn (a weird thing for me, I was a late sleeper) and couldn't go back to sleep. A couple minutes later, I heard the drawers in the kitchen open and slam, the distinct noise of the cutlery. And then the cubboards doing the same. I ran to my grandpa's room (right next to mine) and it took me a long fucking time to rouse him from his sleep, which was another unusual thing. He investigated, nothing out of sorts, of course.

I just thought I'd share a more fun experience here, since some of them are super creepy and/or scary. Also, I apologize for not adding a tag... I'm not really sure how to do that? 

When I was fourteen or fifteen I was having a sleepover with one of my friends. We decided to sleep in the old wicker sleigh bed upstairs over the garage, because it was king sized and my room just had a twin loft. Now, my parents are antique freaks. Dedicated to watching ""Antiques Road Show"" and attending Round Top in Texas and antique auctions whenever they can. They'd purchased this bed at some point.

My friend had a boyfriend who was a very...weird character. Seriously strange. A teenage punk rocker with serious Jewish pride. (Not that him being Jewish is all that relevant, but this boy was severely dedicated to both his sense of style and his faith!) He claimed he could talk to the dead. Or at least to ""spirit guides"" that follow everyone around. He was kind of a loser, but really fun to be around!

We decided to call him up because we liked putting him on speaker phone. He'd always stop mid-conversation to go, ""WHAT?"", and when we tried to talk he'd say, ""No, no, it's someone else."" The someone else would, supposedly, be a dead person.

So we were chatting with him when he did his characteristic pause and said, kind of creepily, ""There's an old lady in the bed with you."" He told us she had died in the bed, and that it was hers. And that she liked us being up there because that room was rarely used (it was my mom's hobby room and the A/C was regulated separately from the rest of the house, so we really didn't use it much because it was always kept so hot). I was a little creeped out, but whatever, we spent the night and I stopped worrying so much about it. (Though every time I'd go up there afterwards, I'd talk to her, saying hello, how are you doing, etc. I didn't really believe in her, though.)

A few years later, the bed was relocated to my parents' new home in another state. One of my mom's best friends was visiting for Thanksgiving. When we were sitting in the living room, chatting together (just her, my mom, and I), she suddenly froze. She said, ""You repaired the bed back there?""

The wicker had been old and coming apart, so my dad took the time to fix it up. My mom told that yes, he had been working on doing just that.

She said that the old woman really appreciated it, and that she had developed a crush on my dad as a result. She wasn't going to leave it any time soon.

So, yeah, apparently old ladies can haunt even the most mundane things. And, you know, become enamored with the living. :)

(I hadn't told my mom about the bed-lady at this point, and it was several years later. The reason I never mentioned it to her was because I had mentioned some other things this crazy boyfriend had told me and she strongly disapproved of me associating with him as a result, so I kept my trap shut after that! Of course, after her friend mentioned the old woman, I let them know what happened.

The Old Talbott Tavern is a popular tourist destination in Bardstown, KY. The tavern has been around since 1779 and has seen many famous guest from Abe Lincoln to Jessie James. At one time it was ranked the 13th most haunted inn in the US. 

I worked there for 4 years and had many unusual experiences but this one took the cake. Ghost hunters would stay over night frequently and we would sometimes stay with them to see if they could catch anything on tape. This video is of the upstairs hallway in which there are rooms on the right side, but NONE on the left. The figure enters the video at 0:42. Enjoy!

Sometimes I went downstairs and tried to talk to my parents, but they were unresponsive, like they didn't notice I was there. 

These experiences occurred sporadically up until I was maybe ten, then stopped. Now I am 18, and I have been noticing a lot of weird things happening in terms of dreams. I have a mild problem with sleep paralysis, which started when I had mono for a while when I was 16. Recently, I've had sleep paralysis in which I've felt myself get up and check my phone or do other things, but then I wake up and realize that it didn't happen. I assume that would be considered lucid dreaming. This happened a whole night once and really disrupted my sleep. On one occurrence, I felt like I was two different people, and one was coming out of my body. I literally saw myself being pulled out of myself from the left side. I told myself ""oh shit!"" when this was happened because I was basically terrified, then woke up as normal. On another recent occurrence, I woke up (or so I thought) and looked into the hallway and saw this white ""spirit cat"". I was going to run to my mom's room to tell her, but I couldn't interact with her nor turn on any lights, just like when I was younger. I sort of floated down the hallway. The other night, I woke up and went into my living room and started floating toward the ceiling and playing this game of sorts. It wasn't scary, it was actually really fun. Then, I tried to interact with my dad who was on the couch but of course he did not hear me. He seemed to notice me though, in a way I can't really explain. I was just wondering if anyone knew what the fuck was up. 

Side note: I smoke weed in moderation, sometimes to help me sleep. I can't do it a lot because I need to focus in school, but I definitely have done it more often than normal lately because it's been spring break.

The wedding was pretty low key. It took place at his brother's house. The couple already had two children and they were pretty adorable. I offered to watch them most of the night because I love being around children.

Well, as we were walking, I was asking them a lot of questions. I asked them if they had fun at the wedding, and they agreed.

Then, I asked to one of them, ""Are you going to get married one day?""

""NO,"" he almost screamed.

I was a bit taken aback. 

I questioned why he would not want to.

""I was already married once,"" he replied, ""when I was big.""

""What do you mean?""

After that he lost his train of thought and went off somewhere else. I had chills.

I tried to tell others about the story, but they all dismissed it as ""kid talk.""

I would like to stress straight away that I am completely scientifically minded and up until this time last year I was 100% a non believer. I live with my girlfriend, we have been together for about 3 years, and she has always been open about believing in the paranormal. Not in a crazy way, she's just had experiences and is open minded about what it could be.

This time last year I was at work, and she was at home sick from work. She had been having a really traumatic time at work, (being assaulted the people she supports with disabilities) and was very stressed out. I would also say that for a couple of weeks, she was taking sleeping tablets and anti depressants, but this ceased prior to the following incidents. I just mention it because Like I say , I am open to all explanations and want to be completely honest.

I was at work and she phoned her sister and mentioned that she felt that there was something in the house watching her. This progressed to doors slamming after her sister (who is a bit of a tool) started inviting the ""whatevethehellitis"" to show itself. (She was on loudspeaker, because my girlfriend is also a bit of a tool). My girlfriend phoned me, told me and I was obviously completely sceptical and thought they were letting their imaginations run away with them. When I got home, several things happened, but the last really spooked me. Our pet dogs and cats started reacting to something in the corner of the room under the stairs (in our front room). Growling etc. Several things were being dropped and smashed but as we didn't see the point of origin this did nothing to convince me. However at bed time, she was in bed and I was stood up on the other side of the room, and a bottle of moisturizer caught my eye. Due to the fact it was floating in the corner of the room, and as I looked at it, it dropped to the floor. That night, shit got heavy. The bed covers kept getting tugged slowly off the bed.  And these weird little glass beads were getting thrown around the room and placed on my girlfriends body. ( They would just suddenly be on her chest etc.)

The next day, exhausted, I went to work. I really didn't want to leave her, but she said she would be OK. She phoned me at several points in the day though, quite upset as doors were being slammed as she walked through them, and she was starting to think she was going crazy. Her other sister visited her that day, and ashtrays and heavy objects were being thrown about the room. Her sister had to leave in the end, as she has two small children and was getting worried for their safety.When I returned from work, her other sister, whom she was on the phone to when it kicked off to begin with, decided to come down with her mother in law (who dabbles in the occult) to see what was happening. This did not help. They all went up to our bedroom, where the majority of the weird things were happening, and tried to communicate with the ""whateverthehellitis"". It began to throw beads, as if communicating with them. For example, it would throw a bead to them, and then they would throw it back, and ask for two more and it would comply. My girlfriend, very freaked out at this point, tried to leave the room, and felt a sharp pain in her back. I was downstairs, and heard shouting, and came up to see them all looking at a deep 9"" scratch down her back! Every time she went into the room, she would get another scratch, despite everyone surrounding her. Though it only targeted her physically, we all saw the effects of  ”whateverthehellitis” were having on her body and our house.

Things just went from bad to worse over the next couple of weeks, with scratches appearing on her face, things being thrown at her, and a wardrobe being pushed on top of her. The scariest was when she was in the bath lying down, and her legs were lifted out of the bath so that her head went under the water and I had to pull her out. 

I should also mention that just before and during this period of time, she was having very bad night terrors, which involved sleepwalking, hitting herself, swearing and even trying to choke me. 

Things got so bad, we left to go to her sisters, but it followed us there and even followed her to work. The only respite we got was a weekend at my others during which we experience no activity except on the first night, when we entered the bedroom we were staying in and found a glass bead on the middle of the bed. My mother is also very sceptical of these things, but as she dropped us off and came into the house with us, she witnessed my girlfriend being scratched deeply across the face twice, as soon as she stepped through the door. As things were so bad, we got in touch with a priest to bless the house. Not much use, as while he was doing it she was being scratched. We also were in contact with a witch who sent us some oils and spells to protect and bless the house. These things did seem to help as over time the occurrences seemed to lessen though it seemed to really drain my girlfriend. 

 And for the past 6-9 months, we have experienced nothing. But the past few weeks My girlfriends bad dreams have started up again, and the other night whilst in bed with the light off, a blue circular light with definite depth appeared momentarily in the corner of the room before flashing once and disappearing. Doors have begun to slam again and last night the weirdest and scariest thing so far happened.

Whilst asleep (her terrors are always about 15-20 mins after she falls asleep) she began to natter nonsense that sounded like Latin to me. I started to write bits of it down and when she woke up we looked at what I had written and googled a few of the words.  I wrote it all phonetically, so the spelling is wrong, but we found phrases that matched perfectly to what I heard/wrote.

This is a few of the phrases she kept repeating first* my phonetic* spelling, then their correct Latin spelling alongside their translations. 

*domines vomestrom* / Dominus vobiscum / Lord be with you

*Ante morte*/ante mortem /before death

*Cynnes*/Cunnus /cunt

*Ocules infernum*/Oculus Infernus /eye of hell/fire

*Egetet provoko*/ego te provoco/ I dare you

*Copse evaile* /Corpus vile /worhtless body

*Abetad morales*/abiit ad maiores /Gone to the ancestors/died.

So yeah.  Bit weird. Some of these phrases she could of picked up subconsciously, but not all of them, and why do they all have a dark theme/undertone?

We are willing to accept logical ideas, but not that we are crazy and imagining things, like I say all our family have seen this happening and full on atheist/sceptic/scientific minded people (friends) have refused to come back into our house after seeing this stuff.

Please help!!!

TL;DR Girlfriend got haunted last year, things flying round, scratching her. Stopped after a while. Beginning again. 
She spoke Latin in her sleep last night!

December 27, 2007 is a date i will remember for the rest of my life as one of , if not the weirdest events to happen to me my ever. So i was at my friends house his name is Will (much easier than me saying my friend all the time). Well will and i decided to go to the library to use the internet. Will lived in a trailer park well more of a trailer home community it was an actual neighborhood with a water tower and everything and the nearest library was about a 4-5 min car ride or a 20 -30 min walk depending on how lazy you were lol. 

Anyways we started walking at 7:40 i remember the time because will had mentioned that they closed at 9. Walking there isn't a problem its just go straight down the street in front of his neighborhood then take a right and then take a left onto a long road  where the library is located on, which is about 2,000ft in length(i am using the measurements i saw on MapQuest i will post a link of the picture at the end of the post). So we walk on the left side of the road because the library is located on that side, we make it and we stay until they close. Its 9pm at this point we start walking back down the road we came with the library being on right of us because we are walking away from it, this road is a little long so we get to chit chatting and what not and we walk down the sidewalk never leaving it we walked for about 5-7 min down this road when we came to the end of the street and we are back at the library... us being on the same sidewalk never turning around or anything and the library being on our left as if we just arrived. We freaked we kinda just stood there in front of the library for about 5 mins trying to pull our selves together, we were so scared we called his mom to come pick us up. 

His mom arrived about 10min after we have called she pulled up to see us in the same spot we were in when we stopped lol we were too afraid to leave that spot. We drove home, this trip took us about 4 min. So we finally get to wills mom's place we are there for about 5 seconds before we leave to go to wills grandparents place which is about a 5 min walk to the other side of the trailer park, on our way over there we see in the sky this ""shooting star"" type object falling from the sky it looked like an orb we did not know what it was, we arrived at wills Gparents place relieved to be there due to the fact of how weird the day was at that point will told me something that terrified me till this very day.. the time. it was 11:30!

I'm posting this from my phone, so I apologize in advance for any spelling or formatting issues. I believe a little back story is in order first.  I am 14 years old, and very skeptical. Please don't assume I'm just some skittish teenager that jumps to conclusions, because I'm not. My friend (we'll call her Amanda) has had some experiences in her new house but chalked it up to her senses playing tricks on her. If anyone is interested in hearing these small things she's heard and seen, just let me know. Her family consists of two small dogs, her twelve year old brother, and her parents. Now, on to the story. 

Over summer break, I went to Amandas' house several times. I had heard her stories about things she heard and seen in her house, but I hadn't experience anything paranormal yet. Anyways, I spent the night, and the next day her parents had to leave for work by 7:00. My mom was getting off work at around 4:00, so we decide to stay at Amandas' house until then. Her brother was at his friends' house, so we had the whole house to ourselves. At around 12:00 AM, I ran upstairs to use the restroom, and left Amanda sitting at the kitchen table. After doing my business, I started walking down the stairs. When I was about halfway down, I heard a door softly close. Not one to jump to conclusions, I naturally assumed it was Amanda looking around in the pantry for something to eat. I jumped down the stairs, as I was going to try to scare her, and found her sitting at the kitchen table where I left her. 

At around two, we were upstairs in her room listening to music and talking when we hear the front door close. ""Hold on, I think my dad's home. Turn down the music for a bit."" I turned it down and heard what sounded like someone wearing work boots walking around downstairs. We looked out the window, but there were no cars in the driveway. There have been break-ins in her neighborhood recently, so we grabbed weapons and snuck down stairs to check it out. We looked everywhere, but there were no intruders and the house was locked up tight. 

Satisfied, we returned to her room. I had just turned the music back on when we heard another noise. This one was also coming from downstairs, and sounded almost like a large marble rolling around on the hardwood floor. I paused the music, and we started listening. After about fifteen seconds of sitting in silence, I started hearing whispering coming the hallway outside her room ( I know, how cliché. It really happened though.) Bewildered, we looked at each other, our expressions saying 'did you hear that?!' The whispering was very faint, but at the same time sounded almost like a stage whisper-as if someone was saying the same word or phrase over and over again. I look at her and ask if she wants to leave, and she slowly nods her head. We casually start walking down the stairs, and the whispering moves so it's right behind us. I push her and she starts running, and I jump the last few steps in my haste to get outside.

After sitting in her driveway for around fifteen minutes, we realized we needed to go back in to get our shoes. We unlocked the door and slowly went inside. We heard banging coming from upstairs. ""Did you hear that? It sounded like this."" Amanda whispered, banging her hand on the table. No more than three seconds after she made the noise, a similar noise came from about halfway up the stairs. We started walking to the door, shoes in hand, when we heard more whispers. At that moment, my mom pulled up and we had to leave. 

I'm going back there tomorrow night, so I may have more stories.

We were watching the news to see the first contact of Earth with an alien race.  It wasn't happening for a while so me and a few of my family members went into my backyard.  In the sky we look up and see three ufos all flying overhead. We ran back inside to go see on tv if they were landing yet.  When I ran in the first thing I did was ask my sister if they were peaceful she said they aren't greys so I would assume so.  I was really confused and then happy by that statement. When it started on the TV I ran upstairs to get my dad who then ran downstairs.  I took a minute because I kept hearing weird noises.  I looked outside and saw an odd vehicle circiling my block.  My dream skipped forward in time a bit.  My mother and sister were vomiting in the bathroom and I asked if they had seen them. My mother guys well thats why we are in here I don't think you should go look.  As soon as she said that I ran downstairs and I was suddenly face to face with one.  It had tron-like armor on with a large yellow circle on its face.  It was tiny like a child in fact when it removed its mask it looked like a child.  The best way to describe them was like those Nordic aliens people say abduct them except their legs were bent the other way. then a few more came.  I was the only person not frightened by them.  The dream ended with me and one of them staring at each other and giggling.  When I woke up I went downstairs and the first thing my mother says is did you get my email.  I go no what about.  She says about the ufos over ------ (I don;t want to reveal where I live).  I went and looked at it and apparently in the month or two there have been three really good sightings in my town this year.  Then shortly afterwards I found an odd hair on my hand it was blond like the aliens.  I was freaking the fuck out.

TL;DR  I dreamt about ufos and aliens and made some crazy prediciton about a story my mother told me.  And I found alien hair.

She says the cats hear it also, they'll look up or run over to the door like I'm home. From my experience I've heard her voice before a couple of times as well when she wasn't home.

I went to the bathroom and then went to plug my phone in on the kitchen counter to charge overnight. 

As i was walking to plug my phone in, i felt like i was being watched and then kept getting chills down my spine. After I had plugged my phone in and started walking to my room, it felt like someone was right behind me about to grab me the whole time. 

Once I got to my bedroom and started getting ready for bed, I felt alone and at ease, but that feeling of being watched slowly came back. As i was climbing into bed i felt like someone was following me at my heels once again, and after i got in bed and turned the lights out, it felt like someone was standing at the foot of my bed just watching me, but when I would open my eyes and look, nothing was there.

She had just signed up for fall courses. She was in a one car accident, braked and over adjusted so hard she slammed into a bush which broke her window, the momentum swung the car around into a lightpole. 

  She had met up with some friends after working closing at her job. I vividly remember her coming in, telling my folks she was going back out, and she'd be back later. I also remember wanting her to stay home, this irrational need for her not to leave. But, I couldn't make myself get up to ask her stay. I was literally paralyzed with fear. She was life support for 3 or 4  days. It felt like weeks. I remember begging her to stay, I  wasn't ready for her to go yet. 
 
   After her subsequent passing, and funeral, when everyone had left, I moved into her room. I changed her clock from her time to actual time, and set an alarm for school the next day. After making other minor adjustments, went to take a shower. I opened the door and rush of warm air and smelled as if someone had recently taken a shower. No one had, it  was the bathroom my sister and I shared, no had taken a shower in there since the day before. While I was investigting the bathroom, the alarm in my bedroom went off. It was back on the old time. I changed it back,   and over the next couple of days things my sister used to do as jokes, or even the clock changing times would happen sparodically. It eventually pettered off, and while the spanish captions would still popped from time to time, life went back to normal. 

  We moved to Seattle when my stepfather's duty station changed. I got married, had kids, and due to very unfortunate events ended up staying with my mother in the same house we had lived in when my sister died, earlier this past year not long after my second was born. When she old enough to be put on the floor to play, she would always stare at the same corner, and babble. Sometimes when she was feeding, she would stop and crane her neck backwards, and smile at nothing. My mom and I joked that she was talking to her auntie. Somehow I think my sister came back to see her two nieces that I desperately wanted her to see...

2) What exactly did you perceive with any of your senses? This includes any unsubstantiated dire feelings.

3) Were/are you on any drugs, including prescription ones?

4) Were/are you consistently deeply stressed and/or deeply depressed?

5) Were/are you on or visited an area that had a horrible event occur upon it?  Such as concentration camps, sites of massacres, etc.

When I moved to my house that I rented with my friends, I would say things changed a bit. First experience, me and my friend were up one night around three playing xbox and we hear two distinct knocks coming from the hallway behind us. Startled, my friend got up to check it out, we then heard two more knocks coming the ceiling touching the wall, not very exciting. A couple weeks later we are sitting on the same couch, at some ungodly hour, and my friend freaks out and says ""I just heard singing in my ear"" he turned beet red and started shaking and sweating. 20 seconds later my whole body had the biggest chill of my life run through it like electricity, it was the strangest feeling ever.

While in bed one night, I dont know if I was sleeping or awake, I saw a dark entity rush over my body and really freak me out, sweating heart race etc, and another night I saw a face directly beside my bed looking at me. 

This is where it gets freaky. Im in my bathroom one night at three am, popping zits (a hobby) when I hear the door knob turning open. I said ""what do you want furbee?"" (furbee is my roomate) and the door opens up by itself right behind me. At this point Im freaking out and saying hello and trying to figure out who opened the door. My roommates were fast asleep. After a minute I hear clawing at the front door of my house, after seeing the dead bolt locked, I promptly went to my bedroom and retreated to the safety my covers.

Little did I know it got worse, I woke up like at 9 am with a tingling feeling on my chest. I went back to bed then woke up a few hours later and looked in the mirror while brushing my teeth to find I had three pencil thin scratches on my chest. Having no nails (i bite them) I found this to be a bit odd. A couple weeks later I notice the same tingling on my chest, realizing what it was this time, I said ""i bet i have scratches on my chest"" sure enough three pencil thin scratches again.

I have written these events in chronological order. I found out after a couple months living there, an old woman had died in the house ten years earlier, I was told this by neighbor across the street who has lived there for quite some time. Also, to note, I lived three blocks away from a cemetery. I also live about a quarter mile away from a park where two girls were murder and hanged from trees in the 70s. I knew about the cemetery and the girls, that had no affect on me before these incidents.

You can believe these stories or not, I dont care, I know what happened to me. To be honest, I wouldn't waste my time writing this if it didnt happen.

My sister (We'll call her Diana) used to see what looked like a cat out of the corner of her eye at night in a small foyer between the bedrooms at her home. She has two cats: one skinny, tan, and with a long tail; the other grey/black, fatter, more squished end-to-end and with no tail. The one she saw prancing about was more like the no-tail one, though it was skinnier and had a tail. The color was also the same. Her husband, a non-believer, actually admitted to the possibility of him seeing something as well.

Fast forward to the past week, and my nephew (we'll call him Romeo) has been having nightmares. Romeo barely speaks as he is only 2 1/2, but knows his words enough to tell a story. He's told Diana that over the last few days, this cat comes into his room, jumps onto his crib, walks along the edge of the crib, then jumps onto his face where he promptly freaks the f out. Today, Diana finally asked Romeo what this cat looked like, using the other cats as examples. He said that it looked like the grey one, but had a tail like the tan one. Diana made the connection and called me to share the news.

Just something fun to read, but honestly, has anyone ever heard of or dealt with a ghost cat? This is the first time I've heard anything about this, but apparently Google brings stuff up when you search it. If it were your case, how would you go about stopping it from scaring my nephew?

I was fully awake and alert. My husband is a few feet away on his laptop and we are just waiting. I hear someone whisper my  name, loud and clear. We both look at each other immediately. He went to the door to see if someone was outside of it, thinking maybe it was someone afraid I was asleep, but there was no one in the hallway. No nurses or doctors nearby. It was strange and very distinct. I am wondering if was my husband's best friend who died 10 days before of a drug over dose. The whisper did not have  male or female tone though. 

Another weird experience that happened within a month of the birth was at our home (not our current one). My husband I got into a major argument about drugs on a few occasions. (He is much more liberal on the topic and I would rather not bother with them). Every time we were arguing about this particular topic, the light in whatever room we were in would start flickering. It did this in both the living room and our bedroom, and it would only happen when we argued about drugs. 

What are your thoughts on this? I almost feel like his buddy was trying to send us a sign when we would argue about it. The other weird thing is I really hated his friend and never got along with him, so I can't imagine he would be in the delivery room, but it would make sense since it was so close to when he died....",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1ir7r1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ir7r1/ghost_in_the_delivery_room/,

He lived on an old farm house which a pioneer family lived in for the great part of the 1800's through 1990 until my Uncle inherited the land. Creepy land too, had Indian graves and old farm equipment still in the barns and things like that.

Anyways, we stayed up late playing games and it came time to goto bed. Being that the house was creepy, at night it would horrify me so when I would wake up to goto the bathroom at night, I would wake my cousin up too. This night, before we went to bed, he told me that he had a double header in baseball the next morning and not to wake him up for anything, even if the house was on fire! Reluctantly I said ok.
I woke up at 2:00am. I went downstairs to goto the bathroom only to find the bathroom light on and the door halfway open. Right outside of their bathroom they had a dresser with a mirror on it, so I decided to look in the mirror to see who was in the bathroom. Inside there was a figure standing looking inside the bathroom mirror (different mirror) with its arms down to its sides. I decided to go back upstairs and wait 10 minutes to come back down. I figured it was just my older cousin getting home and taking off her makeup for the evening.

10 minutes passed by and I went back down stairs. The light was still on, the door was still open so I peaked again. The person was still inside doing whatever it was they were doing, so I decided to wait 10-15 more minutes before trying again. I went back downstairs the final time, but this time things were different. I was wide awake so I could not have been dreaming. The door was completely open and the light changed from an incandecent orange color, to a flourecent blue lighting color. I looked in the mirror and this time whatever was inside turned and looked at me through the mirror. It had deep dark eye sockets, no nose and a mouth that kinda just was opened. It had no pronounced facial features. It lifted its arm up to point to me and sort of backed up and came after me. I turned around and ran as fast as I could back to his room where I pulled the blankets up over my head. I then proceeded to piss my pants and wait until morning to come out of the blankets.

For a number of years I have lived in the southwestern part of Russia, Russia's Dixie as I call it. It is an agricultural area close to the sea and it was very nice to live in a small town there. And this area is what probably fueled my interest in the unexplained ever since I was a kid. It seemed everyone had a story to tell. I thought I'd share some stories that have been relayed to me and happened to myself as well.

A taxi driver was driving home late at night on an empty road when he noticed a white human-like shape appear on the road in front of the car. Before he could react, he passed clean through the apparition. Shaken up, he floored the car to get home as soon as he could and went straight to bed. Leaving home in the morning, he noticed something unusual, the dusty car had a clean stripe approx 1 ft wide going all the way from the hood to the trunk, as if someone took a rag and dragged it across the car.


And very often I would hear stories that are just insane, from people who have no intention of lying and who have absolutely nothing to gain by lying other than ridicule. It seemed the whole area is a huge paranormal hotspot. Also, many locals believe in the existance of invisible creatures called Domovoi, which roughly translates to something living (or attached) to a home. And this was indeed a common belief. Even some traditions and superstitions exist that people perform when they move into a new home, whether or not they want this entity to move along with them. Most commonly, it is known as a peaceful playful entity, however some stories - even though they might be different phenomenas entirely - are far from being peaceful. One story I recall is of a family witnessing a black shadow flying around the room, not being able to see what creates the shadow. Often it would leave feces on the floor all over the house. You could look on the rug, move your eyes away for a second and there will be a pile of crap (pardon my french) sitting in the same spot. And they could not attribute it to any animal as they had no animals in the house. Other reports show classic poltergeist activity.

We ourselves lived in a big three level home, which had plenty of paranormal activity going on.

Once, when I was home alone a whole bunch of years ago, I was around 14 years old then I guess, I was sitting at my computer. My room was set up so that I was facing the room, I couldn't stand facing the wall with the whole room behind me. Straight ahead across the room from me was the door and I could see a part of the hallway, so all it takes for me to see the door and the hallway is to move my eyes slightly away from the monitor. It was very quiet in the house, no one else was home, TV wasn't on, nothing else was going on. As I was minding my own business, doing stuff on my computer, I saw something in the hallway. I move my eyes and I see a bottom of a plastic bottle (that I cut off the bottle earlier for whatever reason and kept on a desk in my room) flying on a parabolic trajectory into the room and falling onto the floor, as if someone threw it gently into the room.

We did have a cat, but the cat was white, so for one thing it would have been impossible not to notice it on the darker floors of the hallway from where the thing came. Secondly, I knew every sound that the house made, I could identify who was walking the stairs (my mom, dad, brother), and the direction they were going just by the sound the stairs made. The floors in the hallway also made a distinct noise, and if the cat was playing there I would have definitely heard it before or after the event. And if something the cat plays with jumps out of its paws, any cat would naturally jump as well, making more noise. Again, I have not heard a single sound before or after it happened, nor did I see the cat, so I am 101% positive it wasn't the cat.

Very frequently when coming home, when no one else was home, I would enter and clearly hear mumbling voices, as if the TV was on but quiet enough so you can't distinguish what was being said. It would appear the sound was coming from the living room which was 10 ft along the corridor, through the door. I would move towards the living room and still hear the voices. As soon as I would pop my head into the room, silence.

I don't talk about paranormal stuff, because I consider myself to be a skeptic, but I couldnt hold back from telling you guys, so I signed up to reddit just so I could maybe have my questions answered.

This memory is almost burned into my brain, I remember it like it was yesterday, and it makes me feel like a nutcase, because I can't think of a reasonable explanation. For some reason, this makes me really emotional when I think about it, so I'll try not to ramble.
I was about 16 or 17 at the time, in bed. I never slept with any lights on or without my tv on, and I had been laying in bed for quite sometime, to the point where you adjust to the darkness, and you can still see things from the light coming through the blinds.
Anyways, onto the point, I remember being in bed, looking towards my wall &amp; my bedroom door. I was just laying there kind of thinking, when movement caught my eye (remember, my blinds are closed, theres nothing in my room moving that can cause a moving shadow). I remember getting a bit spooked out, and putting my head under my blanket until I couldn't breathe anymore, so I pulled my blanket down, and looked near my door, and thats when I saw something that was black. It was darker then a shadow, thick, and I couldn't see through whatever it was. It was shapeless, like a blob with a head and two 'arms', and it was short. I know it was short because I remember looking over and seeing that it was only slightly taller then the height of the doorknob. It was hard for my eyes to focus on it, and it seemed to move to a way that just seemed odd, but I cant put it into words, it was jumpy, and ..'sketchy' if that makes sense. It was flailing and swinging its arms, swaying, but not moving from the spot it was in. 

I remember not being *that* scared, but I was scared enough to not be able to get out of bed to walk past it to get to the door. My gut reaction was to yell at it and try and scare it back (I have no idea why, it seemed like the best idea at the time?) and nothing happened. I ended up feeling my bedside table for my lamp, and flicked it on, when I turned back it was gone, and I never had anything like that happen to me again.
I told my brother about it a few years after, and he's convinced I was probably asleep (not possible, I physically turned the light on), or that I was in a weird state of being asleep or awake, but I know I wasn't.

Please be honest and truthful with me on your opinion about what is happening in my house. Thanks!

I have lived in the same house throughout my whole life but never really noticed anything out of the ordinary except for the occasional bump in the night that most 40-50 year old houses make. The layout of the house is nothing too special, just a big living room/kitchen with a hallway that leads to to a guest bedroom and my parents bedroom as well as a staircase that leads to my brother's room. On the other side of the living room is another hallway that leads away from the rest of the house, almost as if it was a separate building at one point. This hallway goes to my room.

Like I said earlier, I never noticed anything strange until when I was in middle school. I used to be able to fall asleep almost as soon as my head hit the pillow but then going to sleep became much harder for me as I would start getting really creeped out in my room for no apparent reason.

The first thing I remember actually seeing was when I was laying in bed reading one night. I noticed that I left my bathroom light on as I could see the light coming from beneath the door. Planning on turning it off after I finished with the chapter I was on, I resumed reading. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something block out part of the light from beneath the door so I looked up and sure enough, there it was as if there was someone standing on the other side. After staring at it for about five minutes it ""stepped"" to the side and the shadow vanished. This freaked me out enough that I spent the night in my brother's room.

The next event has become a regular occurrence. I would be asleep and always in the early morning (anywhere from 2-3:30) I would be awaken by this sense of someone in my room so I would jolt up and at the end of my room, behind my drum set, I would see this very tall shadowy figure. My first reaction was to plug my ears because I honestly thought some one was about to play the intro to ""Hot for Teacher"" on the drums. My brain started to process what I was seeing and that's when I would become terrified. I would always close my eyes very tight and shove my face into the pillow. When I would work up the courage to look again, it would be gone. I have seen that same shadow figure several times in my room since then and usually in a similar fashion. I recently moved off to college and my sleep has gotten a lot better and I don't see anything anymore. That is until I come home to visit. Every time I come back to my house I see that figure at least one time and I get this huge sense of dread just thinking about sleeping in my room.

BACKSTORY (don't have to read if you don't want to, just skip to the next part): So ever since I was maybe 12 or 13 I've always noticed strange things, my mom did sometimes too but being an adult (and now that I'm an adult I can understand it) she always brushed things off. I was the one that experienced things more often, anyway. 

The two things that stick out the most were when I was about 13  I woke up to my lights turning off and my TV going static. This could most likely be debunked quickly but 13 year old me was terrified, the lights never came back on until the next morning, though all the other lights in the house were working. The TV was fixed about 10 seconds later, however. 

The second thing was about the same age, maybe a little older, I woke up very early in the morning to my door knob shaking. My door knob was and remains to be loose, if you try to open it, it will make a very loose, metal to metal clinging sound so if you shake the entire door, the door knob will shake to. But it was shaking VERY rapidly and VERY loudly, not unlike someone trying to break in to my room. This frightened me.




ANYWAY, ON TO WHAT JUST HAPPENED ABOUT 15 MINUTES AGO....



I'm sitting on my computer, writing music (I'm a musician, sort of), minding my own. I get up to go to the bathroom, do my business and start to leave.

As I'm barely starting to leave the HALLWAY that the bathroom is in, and I mean just barely 3-4 feet from the bathroom door, there is this LOUD, and I mean LOUD banging. Three bangs in rapid succession. I  ran to the living room (for some reason, don't know why I chose the living room, fight or flight I guess) and laid down head first in to the couch, thinking something had exploded.


I got up and saw that all was clear, my rationality started kicking in and living where I am living, I started to think someone was breaking in.


Well that wasn't as rational as I thought. The more I walked around the house, the more frustrated I got. A lot of things didn't make sense:


1) If someone had broken in, or tried, there's no way the bangs would have been that LOUD for that LONG and in that RAPID of succession, I mean they were bangbangbang not even a second between each othe. 

2) The more I started thinking the more I realized the banging sounded like it was coming from the corner between the kitchen and the office/computer room we have here...That doesn't make sense. The best way for someone to break in is to break the glass of the sliding door we have in the office and walk right in. Why three loud bangs? And the only other windows we have are either WAY TO HIGH (in the office) or WAY TO SMALL (in the kitchen)







I think what I just experienced was the 3 knocks phenomena, but while I am not afraid of the paranormal a whole bunch, I am genuinely shaken up by this experience. I really want to hear what you guys think, any input?

After several experiences and reading up on the different topics, a lot of people say the same thing.  

Here's a list of some of my experiences:
* When I was 8 or so, my mom had picked me and my brother up and was taking us home.  When we got to the house, it was in between twilight and dark, so the sky was a beautiful purple.  (It's my favorite time).  She was taking my brother inside (he was in a baby seat) and I stopped by the car to look up at the sky.  All of a sudden, I saw a bright white shape go across the sky. I could see the shape of it, and it was VERY big, so I know it wasn't a shooting star.  I kept staring at it, and another big object flew by as well.  My mom was shouting my name, and she ran over to me.  She told me that all of a sudden, everything got incredibly bright and she couldn't see me.  I didn't see anything get bright, just saw the objects.  Later in my life, my husband was stationed in New Mexico and we took a trip to Roswell. At the UFO museum, I saw a picture that looked EXACTLY like what I had seen. 

*When I was around 11, I was in my former step-father's home.  I shared a large room with my brother and my step sister (who was only there for 1/3 of the time).  This night, I was by myself...my brother was at my grandma's.  Our room was split in half, divided by a dresser. My part on the left as you enter, their part on the right. I was watching TV on their side of the room and could hear my mom and ex step father upstairs fighting. All of a sudden, I saw a dark shape enter the room. It had the height and width of a man with very broad shoulders...but was entirely dark...like a shadow. It wasn't on the wall.  It stopped, the head turned toward me as I lay frozen. It turned back, went to my side of the room and went into my closet.  I've never been more afraid in my life.

Skip forward, I am around 13, staying with my grandma while she undergoes chemo. She is in the living room sleeping, quietly moaning in pain in her sleep.  I was still awake, hard to sleep in that situation, so I went to the living room to get some paper to draw on. I bent down next to her desk and heard a voice whisper in my ear, ""It's ok, go back to your room."" At first, I said, ""Ok."" I then realized that no one was near me enough to say anything. My grandma was still sleeping on the couch across the room. After I went back to my room, I heard my grandma sigh deeply and she started to sleep peacefully.

I'll leave you guys with one more, although there are many more to share.

*When I still lived with my parents (probably 16 or 17), I would come into the house through the garage.  The door led into the kitchen, which had an opening to the living room. One night, as I walked in, I happened to glance over at the doorway between the living room and the kitchen. I saw a man standing there with a blue button down shirt and dark hair (styled like they do on Mad Men). I glanced away, and then looked again, after realizing what I saw. When I looked back, he was gone. I ran to get my dad thinking someone was in the house. We looked in every part of the house and found NOTHING.

He said that he had gone to a town, Bancroft, in Ontario, to visit his friend's cottage for snowmobiling and stuff.My dad and his friend Rick waited until it was night because it was the best time for snowmobiling with the moon being so bright.They suited up in their gear and then left. At this point, it's about 10 pm. They bombed around for a couple hours and Rick's snowmobile broke down. It was nothing abnormal, since the snowmobile was already at least 12 years old. They had left all of the needed tools back at the cottage because there was no where on the machines to keep them, and my dad couldn't possibly leave his friend in the middle of the forest. So they both hop onto the working machine, and a couple hours later, they're back at the spot where they left Rick's snowmobile. They begin to work on the snowmobile, and they see a light. Not a light post, or any form of street light, but a red light. Floating about four or five feet off the ground and at an indefinite distance away is a floating red light. It wasn't that big, or too small, otherwise they wouldn't care. They continue working on the sled and they check back on the light. It has moved. The light had change positions within a small amount of time. They finish working on the snowmobile, and fire it up and it works fine. They're very creeped out by the floating red dot, and try to get back to the cottage as fast as possible. When they see what time it is, it's 7 am. My dad said that there was absolutely any way that they spent more than an hour on the sled, and it should have only been about 3am. Any similar things happen to you? Any possible explanations?

1341551811.0,20,self.Paranormal,w46s7,I have a couple stories about my Grandma who passed last March. It's a tad long.,DundahMifflin,38,18,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/w46s7/i_have_a_couple_stories_about_my_grandma_who/,"Before I get started, I've had my fair share of eerie experiences with ghosts, demons, unexplained voices, etc. But, despite all that, I've never seen anything 'positive', per say. 

My Grandma died in March 2011. She was the first person my entire life who really meant a lot to me, that passed away, so I was very depressed when she died so suddenly. The only thing I've encountered of her post-death, was the night she died.

My dad, grandpa and stepmom were all getting very obviously stressed out throughout the day, and especially when we were having to write out the obituary. Throughout the time they were writing it out, I was telling myself I should just go and sit somewhere else. Once I cooled off, and was walking back into the front room, I *very clearly* hear my Grandma's voice say *something* in my right ear. I still don't know what she said, but it was definitely her. It made me feel at peace for quite a while.

Now, skip to last night. I was at my Grandpa's house following July 4th celebrations, and we got to talking about Grandma again. He said it took him quite a while to get used to not having his wife sleeping next to him. But he said some nights he honestly felt someone was sleeping next to him, but when he turned around, nothing would be there. He even mentioned one night waking up for no apparent reason, and hearing her voice call his name out.

I asked him if anything 'odd' has happened somewhat subtly, as he doesn't believe in anything paranormal. Both he and I are Christians, but have very different beliefs, in terms of ghosts, demons, etc. Anytime I told him or my Grandma about the things I've seen in my old houses, my Grandma would believe me, but my Grandpa would attempt to tell me that it was my imagination.

Anyways -- last August, my aunt and cousin were in town from Minnesota. The first morning of them staying at my Grandpa's, my Grandpa got up early, about 8 AM or so, and so did my little cousin. My cousin was watching TV in the front room, and my Grandpa was making coffee in the kitchen. As he walks into the front room, my cousin asks, ""Who was that?"".

Of course, my Grandpa laughs and asks what he's talking about, but my cousin (who's 12 this year) is insisting he saw a shadow walk *very slowly* across the wall opposite the window in the front room. The sun had only been up for a while, but my Grandpa went ahead and tried to show him that it could easily just be a shadow of a person walking in front of the yard, but to his surprise, they could barely even make out the shadow.

My Granda asked my cousin again what the shadow looked like, and he described it as a large person walking very slowly across the back wall. My Grandma was a somewhat larger lady when she passed away. And, to make it even stranger, the wall the shadow walked across was where the recliner she was always sitting in, sat.

I have no doubt it in my mind that was my Grandma. If this makes any sense at all, hearing that story made me fully realize she was gone. I've obviously accepted the fact she has passed away, but hearing a ghost story kind of sealed the deal.

As much as it makes me happy to hear that, it also makes me miss her more than I ever have.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_w46s7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/w46s7/i_have_a_couple_stories_about_my_grandma_who/,

Black spot likes to wander my house.,vodkasasquatch,31,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/v6btr/not_sure_how_to_title_this_black_spot_likes_to/,"coming close to 6 years ago my dad passed away in a flying accident (he was a crop duster). Needless to say he was my best friend and i loved him very much. I've often passed what i'm about to tell you as just my way of grieving but since coming to college its stopped and hasn't happened. 

Walking around our house is very odd for me. Its never felt the same. And i'm not one who really takes the whole ghost and paranormal thing very seriously. However i am a christian... Funny. But whats been happening is not only strange but it happens in the regular places my father was seen most.

Various times when i have walked around our house i've had to stop and look again because its been something out of the corner of my eye. Obviously i have no proof what i'm telling you. But i don't care. I just want some consolation on the issue. 

Like i said it hasn't happened at college mainly because my father has never been here. Here goes. While walking from one part of the house to another, out of the corner of my eye. I would see a dark fuzzy spot, about the shape of my father, in various places in the house. Mainly in his chair that he would always be sitting. I remember VERY well walking down the hall and walking past the chair only to stop and look back at the chair being CERTAIN somebody or something was sitting there only moments before. 

Another encounter was when i was walking up the said hallway and i walked THROUGH whatever it is in our house. I wasn't creeped out or scared but infact it felt like somebody there to calm me and protect me. I've been very comfortable with whatever it is in the house.

Next thing. I used to talk to myself a lot as a kid. Interpret that however you like. But recently i've taken to talking TO the house. However bizarre it may sound i spoke to the house while it was being very creaky and irritating. Almost instantly it stopped and everything was silent. I just took this as coincidence and left it at that. I'm probably right to. 

As for the dark spot that floats around the house i have seen it various times just 'standing' in one spot. As if its watching me. Only problem is if i turn to look directly at the 'thing' once i've noticed it being there, it instantly disappears.

So r/paranormal. Can you tell me your thoughts on this? Is there something living in our house? Could God (if you believe that or not) have sent my father to 'visit' or is it something bad that i should actually be scared of? As i said before, I have never seen this 'being' outside our house.

Not battle, but all I remember of it was being very hungry and feeling sick, even after I woke up. I think it might've been the Civil War or something around the same time but it scared me senseless and it was all I talked about to my parents that day. I asked my dad earlier about what he remembers and he said that I did not watch any war documentaries at that age but I had knowledge of battles and generals around the Civil War/Mexican-American War era. There is almost no way a toddler could have knowledge of this stuff without being shown by their parents. I need to know if anyone else has experienced something like this or knows anyone who has.

One morning, I was in the middle of a dream in which I was exploring nature, suddenly I felt pulled by some force. Next thing I know, I'm floating in the middle of my bedroom in spirit form, looking across the room at my sleeping physical body. I observed how dead, grey, and cumbersome the physical body looked, just laying there sleeping.  So at this point I am aware that I have spontaneously astrally projected. And never had I been so lucid and in control. My astral body (spirit body) turned slightly.....I could see through the wall into my friends bathroom! She was washing her face and brushing her teeth! I sensed that she paused for a moment....uh oh she could sense me observing her. I did not want to make her uncomfortable so I turned away to the window and thought, ""let's go outside."" Just then, another amazing thing happened. My consciousness projected out of the astral/spirit body! I became my true self/living lite/orb of consciousness/soul!  Immediately all human hang ups dissipated. Such as fear, anxiety, even temperature! I was this body-less orb of consciousness, I felt completely crystal clear, with 380 degree vision/perception, and completely connected to everything and everyone, yet separate, yet with my own energetic print, my own will.  I just was, and it felt like home, totally natural and normal, like ""oh yeah, I remember this.....no biggie."" Now get this, I am simultaneously aware both physically, spiritually and at a soul level. My physical body is warm and comfortable and sleeping in bed, while my astral/spirit body (I guess you could say ghost?) is keeping watch over the physical body, watching to make sure nobody comes in the room, while my soul/consciousness is outside having an amazing lucid experience.  Back to the soul. I turn away from the house, and towards to beautiful forest. In particular, one tree at the edge of the lawn. Just by thinking, you create, do, manifest, go. I think about moving towards the tree, and it happens so quickly as if I was already there. Like an instant zoom in feature or something. I'm about three feet away from the tree. I see a droplet of water on the bark. I zoom in, and am inside the droplet of water! The water ""knows"" that it is on the side of a tree, it can sense it's surroundings! It says ""I exist"" I feel the water, I twirl around within the droplet of water, seeing the house and other trees warped by the lens affect of the water droplets surface. I leave the water droplet ""ahhh now I know what it's like to be a droplet of water."" I hover in the yard again. Next I zoom into the tree, I travel through multiple layers of bark and juices. I can feel and taste each layer, the acidic rough bark, there is a sugar, watery tast to the layers, but also chemicals of some kind. I hover there for a moment, inside this tree. This tree ""knows"" it's position and place near the house, it can sense the presence of the house via warmth, wind, sun, and the energetic pattern that the house gives off. This tree knows that there are other trees around it, below it and beyond.  I leave the tree ""ahhh now I know what it is like to be a tree, thank you tree.""  I hover above the grass. I want to go DOWN! I zoom through layers of soil and pipes, gravel, sand, clay, then DARK HEAVY ROCK, very black........then I sense heat, I can see yellow,orange, then red, black heavy rock, lighter rock, clay and sand and soil then I see blue and a different type of heaviness and I shoot up through the ocean on the other side of the planet! I breach the waters surface, I think I'm in the middle of the Pacific Ocean!  Okay that's enough time to go back! Hurry.......Lynn, my friend is stirring within the house, she's coming closer to the bedroom, I have to pee, it's almost time to wake up! My soul reunites with the astral body, the astral body snaps back into the physical body and BOOM! My eyes open, I'm back, and just as I lean up in bed, Lynn knocks on the bedroom door! ""It's time to get up, want some coffee?"" 

Later that day we sit down and I tell her what happened. She cuts me off mid sentence, ""wait a minute, I knew you could see me in the bathroom, I hope you didn't see me on the toilet.....oh no....okay, just washing my hands, alright. How funny, I knew something was happening, wow.""

Need some answers Please.,IloveaMILF,37,11,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/q1kz5/anyone_have_an_explanation_need_some_answers/," Not really sure if this is supposed to be be here so if I am in the wrong spot let me know. I just have some questions because of stuff that has happened and the culmination of everything is starting to bother me in some ways. 
 
So when my dad's real dad( we will call him Ray) died of cancer in the 1970's the clock sitting above the piano in the house stopped. He died in the middle of the night. He had to use the bathroom and when my grandma helped him out of bed his skin was cold. He didn't say anything and a few minutes later he passed away. Anyways... yeah the clock died at the time of his death. 
 
 Another oddity is that the man( we will call him Hank) that she got remarried to passed away last year and he passed in the morning. He was a big guy and had one of those electric recliner lay-z-boys that has the remote to go up or all the way back in a reclining position. Well  the chair was working perfectly fine. Then he passed away and it went down to a normal sitting position and didn't work anymore.( someone used the remote it didn't do it by itself). Anyways. My son(his great grandson, also 2 yo) loved sitting on his lap and making the chair go up and down. my son was the last person to get it to work.( My son and grandpa were oddly close. closer than any of the other grand kids. My grandpa could walk very well because he had very bad knees but would get down on the floor and play tractors with my son). Another thing... the week before my grandpa died, it was like he almost knew.Examples- he called all of his kids and told them that he loved them and was proud of them(even the one he didn't get a long with), he was not a big eater, but the last meal he had he asked for his favorite(fried Chicken) and ate a lot, then he would almost stare longingly at my grandma like he knew he wasn't gonna see her for very much longer.
  
 Well about a month before my grandpa passed away. My son started being bothered(or haunted) by a "" big scary man with long spaghetti hair( we only eat angel hair pasta so I am guessing string blonde hair) claws and no lips. Like a Zombie"" he has a very good vocabulary. The thing would come out of his wall and try to touch his head or bite him. It got to the point where my son would not go near his room at all. The about a week after my grandpa's death. We found my son playing in his room. He told us grandpa Hank came and told the scary man to leave him alone. After that we would hear my son laughing and talking in his room like he would talk to my grandpa. Also my newborn would lay in the room in his crib and would stare at a certain spot and smile and coo. 
We live in a small 800 sq.Ft. apartment. and along with the scary man, we see shadow people walking from our room to the bathroom or my sons room out of the corners of our eyes. 

  So I guess I am looking for answers or sources to look at as to:
1) why do things stop when someone dies?
2)  Do people subconsciously know they are going to die? or about to?
3) What the hell was in my sons room. Any ideas please tell me. and...
4) Are my wife and I crazy for seeing that kind of stuff?",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,True,,,True,t3_q1kz5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/q1kz5/anyone_have_an_explanation_need_some_answers/,

From where I'm from, on the second floor, it sounds like someone is starting from the bottom of the stairs and ending up on the landing in front of my room, then back down again.  We also hear doors opening and sometimes closing randomly.

Today, my mom sold a lot of my stepdad's things, including his catering equipment, which he was very fond of.  The guy buying the equipment was freaked out because there were (I guess) over 100 dragonflies circling the area, which isn't very common here. 

I don't know why I shared this, it's just creeping us out.

edit: Also, a few months after my stepdad died, I had a dream that I was in the room above the garage (now my sister/nephews apartment) and that my stepdad came through the back door (a separate set of stairs, at the bottom of the stairs)  wearing his usual attire.  I dreamed my stepbrother on the couch, catching him come in and looked as startled as the rest of us.  Stepdad walked in the back door and said ""Hey, where have you guys been?""  My mom relayed to me that she had this same dream, from a different angle (her room), before I told her about my dream.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,True,,,True,t3_kz3u8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/kz3u8/dont_know_why_im_posting_things_are_just_creeping/,

Maybe it's browsing this thread that conjurs up old feelings or my never subsiding fear of the dark I have always had as a kid.

Background: I live in an old hotel built in the 1900s that was converted into an apartment (I always have a pension for creepy Shinning type apartments). I moved in here and I notice there was a lot of damage to the wood floors in some areas like severe wood rot or burning but I digress. Basically this place has had a fair share of shady characters due to its relatively affordable rent/available subsidized housing. 

Well a few months ago I fell asleep after work relatively early with daylight still out. I felt like I woke up in my dream but I was still in my room but this time it was dark out. Everything was the same the door was cracked, but it looked like there were lights I could see shining in my hall were almost like the bright tinge of yellow orange fluorescent street lamps peaking in (I live on the top floor apartment so there was no way the street lights would be able to reach me). Shortly after waking in this lucid dreaming state I thought I heard my dog wandering by my bed on the floor beside me. I wasn't too startled until I realized he was under my bed sleepin (this part was actually true which makes this a really weird dream/reality mash up). All of a sudden I see  and feel this black female  like figure craw up on me. She was kinda like a spider but all black. I just remember black spindly fingers and her grabbing my neck and face trying to get me to look at her face. But it was really weird cause I could almost imagine what her faced looked like without me actually looking at her (almost like she was trying to project the fear in my mind). Anyways, I could feel my back arching and her just kind of trying to pull towards her while I restrain. At that moment I wake up mid writhing (haha sorry doesn't make too much sense). In my room, door cracked, dog asleep and completely out if breath. 

I dunno if I was just loosing it. Or just stressed from work (creates a lot of my fatigue). But some nights like last night just leave me an eerie feeling when I think about that moment.

1374495712.0,22,self.Paranormal,1it3ao,I think my house is haunted....,xProtoz,30,8,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1it3ao/i_think_my_house_is_haunted/,"Okay to make the first part quite simple, I am a 16 year old who just moved to Germany. There has been some strange things happening in our new house. The only things we've encountered so far were sounds. The creepiest one was last night, but we will get back to that in a moment. So for the first night here, I had this really, really weird feeling while sleeping in my room. I don't know if it's just because it was a new house or what. But the next day was fine. It was fine for about 2 weeks. 

Then one morning I come downstairs and my mom says ""I was so scared last night... I was laying down trying to sleep and it sounded like somebody got up off the couch, walked straight to the side of my bed and just stood there."" (My mom couldn't get wifi on her laptop so she put her air mattress down in the living room.)

I sort of just blew it off and thought it was her just over-reacting to a random noise. So the next night I am downstairs at 2 AM by myself with all the lights off playing my laptop at the dining room table. (I also don't get great wifi from my room.) I was just about to get up and grab a snack when I heard the exact noise that my mom described the day before. It sounded as if from across the living room, somebody got up off the couch. I didn't hear footsteps like she did, but I turned on the light and both the living room doors were closed and nobody else was in there with me.

I didn't think much of it being paranormal because it could have been just some freak occurence that happened to me and my mom...

EDIT: I forgot to include this: My mom was upstairs by herself while me and everyone else in the house was downstairs. We all heard this very loud slam like someone just slammed their door shut. It clearly came from upstairs. Worried, I went up to check on my mom and she came out of her room also wondering what that noise was. We checked all the rooms and every single door upstairs was open. We left all of our doors open to get air flowing but still we heard a door slam shut even though all of the doors were open.

Last night is where it really stuck in my mind that it might be paranormal. I just got back to my room from eating a snack and it was about 1-3 AM ish, I didn't really check the time. It was kind of hot in my room due to my laptop being on maximum performance mode, so my window was wide open with the blinds and curtains open too. There is this gate on the side of my house, right under my window, which is a bit creaky, but it opens pretty smoothly. Anyway, I got back into my room, sat down on my bed, grabbed my laptop and started watching some youtube videos. I paused the video to open up another tab and I heard the creepiest thing I have ever heard in my life.

The gate right underneath my window creaked open slowly and it was very, very loud. There was a couple seconds of silence after it creaked open, and that's when I heard it creak slowly shut again. I didn't visually see the gate open and close, but I heard it clear as day.

I looked out my window and there was nothing there, the gate was closed. I thought it might have been a neighbors gate, but the closest neighbor is about 300 feet from our house. There is no way it would have sounded that loud from that far away.

The worst part is that earlier in the day, I remember my cat escaping, so I walked through that gate. I VERY CLEARLY remember closing that gate, and checking multiple times that It was actually shut and wouldn't open. 

I will keep this updated with any other things that happen around my house. (This is not one of those made up stories you see on here, this is real experiences I have had at my new house. If someone has a suggestion as to how I can capture this, I will be more than glad to try.)



EDIT: Some people are saying that it could be wind or an animal that pushed my gate open. Here are three pictures that I think should prove that wrong.

Almost every other experience I've had was before I turned 16. 

Both started with me being woken up from my sleep by a loud electrical crackling sound in my ears. As though it was being done right by my head. When I've sat up in my bed, fully conscious, there are weird lights in my room. They're difficult to describe,  but they look like multi-coloured disembodied lights dancing around eachother around 6 feet off the ground, and for some reason have on both occasions put the fear of God into me. It's weird to me that I find this so terrifying. They're only lights. But I'd love to know if anyone else has ever seen anything like it, or heard of anything like it.

Here's what happened.

The last few months, as my stress levels (from working too much) have increased, weird things have been happening to my house. In May, the day I was about to go out of town and visit a friend, part of my ceiling tile in the hallway collapsed and woke me up at about 3 in the morning. Needless to say, I canceled the trip to take care of that.

Last month, as I was drying off after getting out of the shower, the light fixture in the bathroom fell out of the ceiling and shattered all over the bathroom floor. Completely unprovoked. I avoided the glass and closed the door behind me, then took care of it later (again, it was a workday - I didn't have time to stop and sweep up glass).

This morning, right at 4:45 AM, my dog and I were both awakened by a loud crack, something unmistakable as a window breaking. I rushed out to the living room and sure enough, one of my windows looks like someone took a bat to it. 

Note: my house is in a small town, flooded with tourists at this time of year. It's also up on stilts, so the main floor is on the second floor (as is the custom around here) and the main floor is only a carport.

Back to the window. Knowing that, I would have heard and felt someone running down the stairs if someone had taken a bat to my window. I went outside and walked around the porch to the window, thinking maybe a piece of hail (it did rain overnight) or a bird had crashed into my window. Looking at the window, it dawned on me: there's a screen on the outside of the windows, and the screen wasn't damaged.

Back inside and I took another look at the window. A closer look. The window was broken from the inside. No shattered glass, just a big ugly crack. Once it's bright enough, I'll take a picture if requested.

My question to all of you: is my stress manifesting and causing these damages, or do you think there's something else at work here? Any and all respectful opinions are welcome.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1i57sa,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1i57sa/unexplained_something_is_wrong_with_my_house/,
1373566471.0,24,self.Paranormal,1i3h2k,Growing concern,BigMoveThrowaway,28,4,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1i3h2k/growing_concern/,"Eight years ago I bought a house in the suburbs. It's not an old house, it was built in 1991. As far as I know, there's nothing particularly historic about the area. It was settled by German farmers and eventually transitioned into suburbia as urban sprawl engulfed it.

My ex-wife picked out the house. She seemed happy, so I went with it. The purchase went smooth except for one odd moment at closing when the broker said, ""The sellers must disclose any deaths that occurred in the house,"" and the very nice couple selling house immediately broke in with, ""deaths that weren't by natural causes. No, there weren't any."" 

Ok, it was a little weird, but we were just excited about buying our first home. Also, I had zero belief in ghosts or anything supernatural, so it crossed my mind that maybe grandma or grandpa died there, but who cares?

Six weeks after we close on the house, the wife is gone. All sorts of revelations about how she never wanted to live in the suburbs, she hates the house, etc. Divorce ensued. We only put 3% down on the house because at the time they were handing out mortgages like candy, so there wasn't enough equity to sell without losing at least $10k. I was left living alone in suburbia in a four bedroom house with no furniture and a black labrador retriever.

Because the house was empty, we played ball quite a bit. I could throw a tennis ball down a hall and through both the living and dining rooms for the dog to bring back. Good times.

The first strange event occurred about four months in. I threw the ball and instead of coming right back with it, I hear the dog bark. I walk into the kitchen to find the ball sitting in the middle of the floor and the dog cowering right at the edge of the kitchen area, timidly stepping forward towards his ball, but then nervously looking up and backing up, then barking at the air. Even with me there, I could not coax him to walk into the middle of that kitchen and get the ball. I picked it up, walked out of the room and attempted to repeat the experiment.

Sure enough, once again he wouldn't go get the ball, he just kind of nervously cowered.

I picked the ball up and we tried it again. This time, he bounded right through the kitchen, pounced on the ball and brought it back to me like nothing had ever happened.

I laughed off the incident.

The next weird thing to happen was also in the kitchen. I was washing dishes by hand because living alone, I didn't have that many, and I just did them every day or two. I set a cup on the counter and it started sliding away from me. The first cup traveled about a foot. Mesmerized I set a second cup on the counter. This one also slid down the counter and passed the first cup. I set a plate on the counter and it slid halfway to the cups. My scientific mind said, ""That's kind of eerie but easily explained since the dishes are wet, and they're essentially just hydroplaning."" 

Then came the touching.

I had an elliptical trainer, and one evening after work I was running on it shirtless. (Yeah, I know, working out shirtless is cheesy, but I live alone, so it was less laundry. I'd often just run on it in flip flops and boxer briefs. I would have just used it barefoot, but the foot areas had texture that hurt my feet. Anyway, the only part that matters is that I was shirtless.) I'm running along. I'm probably about 15 minutes into the 20-minute program, and someone puts their hand on my back.

I live alone, I'm working out in my living room ALONE, and someone puts their hand on my back. Yeah, I flipped around fast and almost ate shit jumping off that elliptical. Nobody there. My heart is racing, but I assess the situation and get back on the elliptical to finish out the set. I run another two or three minutes, and it happens again. 

Once again, I flip around to find nothing behind me. I'm legitimately spooked by this point, so I say, screw it, that's enough cardio for tonight. I also decide never to do elliptical without a shirt on again.

I get a couple guy roommates and the weird stuff stops. I've had guy roommates for almost seven of the eight years I've been in the house.

Then I get engaged. The guy roommates are still there for now, but the fiancee is also in the process of moving in. She's been sleeping there every night for about a month.

I've got two dogs now -- the lab is gone and these are smaller dogs. One, who is a total lap dog and follows me around has started disappearing. When I go look for her, she's always sitting by herself in the study. I'll call her back into the living room with us, and she'll come in for a few minutes but always disappear again to that other room.

The other dog is now staring and barking at the air. 

The fiancee seems happy and hasn't noticed anything ... yet. However, she has big plans to start renovating the house in a couple months once she gets moved in and the roommates find new places. 

My logical, scientific mind says this is all coincidence. The dogs probably hear squirrels on the roof or something. 

But I have this growing concern that there is an entity in the house that is angered/awakened or maybe just derives energy from a female presence. Maybe the entity is female and is jealous?

The past few months, it seems she is having an encounter with a spirit or entity. Many times in the night she will cry out of nowhere similar to cries she makes only when she is pinched or hurt in some way. Other times she will stare up at the ceiling and often while avoiding eye contact with me and just laugh. She will many times look up past her net of stuffed animals that we hung from the ceiling or laugh or cry. We use monitors for when she naps or sleeps through the night and many times we have heard tapping or whispering, and while we have neighbors on both sides, it's typically always when they are asleep and the building is completely silent. The speakers/studio monitors I use with my computer often times pick up radio frequencies(which is normal) but we've started hearing the whispering and tapping on there, too. Out of nowhere, even when they are turned off, it will send out a loud popping sound or a large static-y quick yelling type sound out of nowhere. We hear many noises from upstairs that sound like my cats walking or knocking things over, but I will investigate only to find them sleeping downstairs. Any thoughts?

Also: it's normal for an occasional blurry or distorted picture to occur, and having a baby that moves a lot, it seems more common, but it seems to happen too commonly with our daughter. We've caught quite a few pictures that we usually delete, but I've posted one from the Fourth of July that we took and it is sort of creeping me out how often it has been happening.

The TV was off and my friend Jim was asleep. We were in the den, and the closest room to it was visible because the door was open. I looked through the doorway, and I saw something I still can't explain. It was 3 greyish figures. Their position was almost like that of a pose for a family photo, but they were people; human sized. It appeared that they stood there just staring in my direction. Not even at me, it appeared they stared past me. There was a woman, a man, and a younger man standing behind them. I blinked several times and made sure that I wasn't dreaming or hallucinating. After a while I just went to sleep. I told Jim about it later and he said he had always had a weird feeling about that room, too. It always felt cold and uninviting.

When I was about twelve, I had a Ouija board. There were a few odd situations that came up, but they could all be explained by the ideomotor effect. Except this one.

We were at a birthday party, playing with the board. At the time I was a believer and completely neurotic about ""proper"" use of the board. So we were called for cake, said our goodbyes to the spirit and I flipped the indicator upside down and placed it beside the board. I even, in my need to be thorough, moved the indicator once it was on the table towards the board to make sure it could not be slid onto it without lifting; the board was too thick for the indicator to slide up due to random vibrations or something.

We went downstairs, me bringing up the rear. We ate our cake. Everybody in the house was at the table this entire time, nobody got up to use the toilet, and the stairs to the floor with the Ouija board were within my sight the entire time. Nobody could go upstairs without me noticing, and there was nobody in the house to go there if I had missed them.

When we were done, I lead the group of girls back up the stairs. Only to find the indicator is sitting, right side up, in the middle of the board. I was the last one downstairs, the first one up.

I was 19 at the time, and though I had experienced mild inexplicable occurrences before, this was the first time I ever had a full on reality shattering event.

A friend and I decided to go to Magic Springs, an amusement/water park in the city we lived in.  From the moment we walked in the park, everything seemed strange.  The place was crowded as usual, but nobody seemed to be happy.  There were flocks of children and families, yet no one was smiling.

I noticed immediately upon entrance that there was something not quite right.  I don't know if my friend noticed, but we did our usual rounds of roller coasters and rides.  

I remember a specific event, where we were on this ride that straps you in a pod in a seat, next to another pod and seat.  My friend and I were in adjacent pods, and the ride got stuck while we were in the air.
We both looked at each other, and the look in his eyes was empty and...defeated.

The last ride we took that day was the log ride.  You get in this plastic ""log"" with seats and handles, float along a lazy river until you get pulled up a slope and fly down until a huge splash.

We got in the log, and it was just he and I.  At the beginning, you kind of snake your way around this part with a fence along the bank where spectators or family members can see you, and wave or take your picture.  

As we come around a corner, I see this woman standing at the fence. The instant she comes into view, the hair on the back of my neck stands up.  She is in her early 50's, black, with graying hair.  She looks almost exactly like the Oracle from the matrix, but there is nothing happy or holy about this woman.

She looks mean, and intense, and she is staring fucking daggers right at my friend, who is seated in front of me.  She is in our frame of sight for about 20 seconds, and she just glares right at him.  Follows him with her gaze, from right to left.

We go around a corner, and I am like ""Dude, did you see the way that woman was looking at you?"" and he is like ""Yeah, What the fuck was that?""  I replied ""Dude, I have no idea, but that scared the shit out of me.""

We complete the ride, and having been thoroughly scared shitless, we call it a day.

Less than a week later, my friend was dead, from suicide.

Perfectly normal. I've had odd things happen before, but nothing recently, and nothing as odd as yesterday. Which I've told her about. In her personal opinion (though she's nonreligious) the supernatural/paranormal is an actuality, as she's seen too many sane people experience things in her 30 years of work to simply write it off as nonsense.
I've been seeing her for about 9 months now, and were I to be suffering with something, she'd have noticed by now. She's been in her line of work for a hell of a long time and after a while I'm sure it gets easy to spot the true crazies.""*

Original: http://www.reddit.com/r/Thetruthishere/comments/1cl6et/today_has_been_full_of_odd_occurrences/

I've had an exceedingly paranormally active day, it seemed every corner I turned something would happen. I'd think I was crazy, but I wasn't the only one to witness the happenings.

First things first, this morning I was alone in the house doing my makeup before school. Not one other person in the building, no music on, nothing. Utter dead silence, when suddenly I hear tiny whispers from a few feet away. The voices become more distinct, and I recognize them to be female. They giggle and talk for a while, and I try my best to ignore it. I was late, and didn't have time to deal with it.

Driving to school I was panicked because I had about 8 minutes to do a 15 minute journey. However, when I actually got there, only 6 minutes had passed. Speed limits had been kept to, and I hadn't misread the clock, due to my double checking in disbelief of how late I really was. (This ones more /r/Glitch but oh well.)

Everything was normal and dull at school, nothing else happened until three hours after I'd arrived, at about 11. We had a free day, and were allowed to do whatever as long as there was complete silence. The teacher's not one to let someone off without a detention, so everyone was abiding by the rule. Suddenly, I heard the whispering again. Closer this time. I looked around, no one was talking, no one had moved. The same voices, it sounded like. Giggling and talking.

About ten minutes after this, I heard someone say quite clearly and in a normal tone: ""The next one should be easier.""

I jumped at the disruption of the quiet, and looked too see who had spoken. Not one person in the room had reacted, no one was being written up. The phrase started repeating in my head. Over and over and over. The only thing I can think of is either I'm going insane (I seriously hope not) or someone thought that, or some sort of entity said it. It made no sense to my thought pattern of the time.

Later on I was returning from lunch, and the cafeteria is across a courtyard from the main building. The buildings are modern, and the doors are heavy and metal. They're the kind where you have to push a bar to open them. The wind was blowing heavily, and I was expecting to struggle with the door, considering that the winds direction should have been blowing it shut. No sooner had a laid a hand on the bar that the door swung open, gently. I walked through, and it closed just as gently behind me, rather than being slammed closed by the wind. A guy I don't know was standing in the courtyard staring at me, and asked: ""How'd you do that?"" I just shrugged, and kept walking, but was inwardly freaked out. (These doors are not, have never been, nor will they ever be automatic in any shape or form.)

Lastly, I spend the evening at my boyfriends house. I walked from his room into the living room, and could have sworn I saw an older woman sitting on the sofa. Looking directly at me. She felt/looked grumpy with my presence. She gave off the feeling of being someones mother/grandmother. I was freaked out, and turned the light on. Still the outline of her form and the feeling she gave lingered. I was freaked out, and told my boyfriend. He said I'd described his fathers mother, who I hadn't known. Nor had I known she was passed.

For the remainder of the evening both my boyfriend and I continued to see orbs and lights in his room, darting about.

So, that was my freaky day. Pardon for any spelling mistakes, and my laziness when it came to the story telling, etc. I'm exhausted.

The room I had in my teenager-time at my parents house liked it to let things disappear. Sure, it's a common phenomenon, but I think my case is a little different.
I remember two days where it was really strange. The first one is kinda short. I had some friends over at our house and wanted to get a coin out of my wallet. It slipped and we all saw it rolling over my carpet and then landing on a dark spot. Naturally, I wanted to pick it up immediately, but it was gone! We searched everywhere, under the carpet, flipped the carpet and such things, but it was gone. That was totally strange, but we laughed a bit about it and that was it.
The next event happened some years later, same room (my room). I wanted to check the website of a local video store, so I got the card out of my wallet and it slipped (again, lol). I saw where it was falling, but I decided to check something on the computer first. After 2 minutes or so I wanted to pick the card up, but it was gone. Again, I searched everywhere, even at impossible places. I thought ""Shit happens, I get another one"" and so I did, not minding what happened to the card.
One or two years later, I was sorting out some books and magazines in my room. I began with the bottom, which is near the ground. The moment I grabbed a magazine in the middle of a staple, my lost video store card fell out of it, like it fell two years ago on the ground, bounced, and landed between the pages of that magazine.
I felt weird, but I'm glad that nothing like this happened again in the last years. Since then I try not to let things fall to the ground in that room again.

Well, how I said, not that spectacular, but I can't find a proper explanation.

Please take this seriously because I do.

Back in 2008, my girlfriend and I decided to go to an abandoned mental asylum off of Highway 82 in Alabama called Old Brice.  It shut down a few years back due to malpractice, and some of the ghost legends, like the number 2 ghost, involve murder by staff at the facility.  

Essentially, this was a dumping ground for people that society didn't know what to do with.  Thousands of people were sent there, and died there.

The facility consisted of 4 buildings: Brice (the residence hall), S.D. Allen (the medical facility), the crematorium, and the guard shack.  I have seen two ghosts in the residence hall, the bigger of the two I share with you now.

My second visit to Old Brice was strange.  It was my first time inside the building, and I came prepared.  It was me, my girlfriend, and our friend Chris.  I had a flashlight and a DVD camcorder.  Through the main entrance is a staircase on the right, which zig zags up to the second floor, complete with anti suicide fence at the top.  Make a left, then another left, and then a quick right, and you are in the hall that led to the children's corridor.  I had the flashlight in my left hand and camera in the right, scanning, trying to catch something.  On the left at the entrance to that room, there was a bathroom with only a tub in it.  

I thought I saw something in the bathroom and shined the light that way...nothing.  Moved the camera and light, thought I saw it again, and shined it back...nothing.  Our night continued and finished without incident.  

The next day, I reviewed the footage.  In that bathroom, I shined toward something I thought I saw, and I was right.  When the light pans to the right, a blue-ish white, illuminated little girl's face peers out from behind the door to follow the light.  As the light shines back in her direction, over the course of two frames, she is half behind the door, next frame she was gone.  

My heart felt like an ice cube ran through it I was in such shock.  I proceeded to show everyone I knew.  The girl's appearance was that of younger than ten, hair parted in the middle, unusually large forehead, and had some apparent deformation or disorder.  I made the mistake of leaving the camera at a friend's house overnight, who apparently was not my friend, and he stole it.  

This is where it gets weirder.  Two and a half years later, I was living in a different city.  One of the legends of Old Brice is that windows grow back, and if you do any damage to them, spirits will follow you home.  I broke a window.  

I was laying in bed one night, about 3-4 AM.  I was on the verge of sleep, aware of where I was, and very comfortable.  Out of nowhere, this...immobilizing tingling sensation started at the tips of my toes.  I was laying on my stomach with my arms under the pillow, completely helpless as this sensation crept its way slowly up my legs, midsection, and eventually entire body over the course of about 20 seconds.  Once it covered me, I heard the whisper of a little girl, directly in my ear, say ""I'm in your room..."". I cringed tight and for some reason said aloud, ""I love you"".  The feeling stopped and left me on the verge of tears.

It may or may not have been that little girl from the asylum, but according to legend, it makes sense.  Let me know if you want to read about my other experiences.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_194dx4,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/194dx4/the_girl_at_the_asylum/,

Last summer while being 6 mos. pregnant with number 2 (1st one is his and 2nd is not my ex's, we just did business together), my ex-husband and I were tag teaming a smallish house in South Bend.  All utilities were off to this house.  It was not our first time there either. Tiny house in poor condition, mold, one floor, stone/concrete basement.  Houses have vibes and this one gave me a feeling of dread and anxiety in the basement.  I grab the ex to go in the basement with me.  We do our thing and head back up (take photos, check it out with a flashlight for new damages).  

When I say tiny house, I mean 700 sq. ft. of tiny.  Basement stairs were in the kitchen.  At the top of the stairs was an old phone that was not plugged in.  This phone started to ring.  I flipped and just stared.  It rang and rang and rang.  It was loud, shrill, and echoed through out the entire house.  I said a little prayer (I even have a cross tattooed on me for comfort) and picked up the phone.  Dead silence as if someone was just listening.  I slammed it down and ran out of the house.

Thankfully it only happened once.  We even had to visit the house again several times before it sold.  The creepy feeling never went away and the unplugged phone never rang again. My ex was puzzled by it.  He is seriously religious and I used to be a long term Catholic school girl.  I hate when weird crap happens to me or around me.

We moved into this house about 2 years ago.  But soon after, my brother and I started experiencing strange occurrences.  Though neither of us spoke up about it for awhile.

Both of us would hear what sounded like a small child running down the hallway.  Our hallway is tile, so there is no creaking.  At times, we may also hear laughter or talking.  But we don't recognize the voice.

I have two small children (ages 5 and 3).  But the reason these occurrences stand out is because they happen when the kids are asleep or gone.  The voice and footsteps sound like they are from a small child.  The steps are about the same as when my 3 year old runs down the hall, but the voice is a higher pitch than his.

The first time I realized it wasn't just me was one night after the kids had gone to sleep, I had just entered the hallway when my brother rushed out his door.  ""Where's B (my 3 year old)?!""  I was confused as to why he was so worried.  I told him B was in bed perfectly asleep and had been for awhile.  He told me he had been hearing a kid run down the hall and laughing.  I checked and both my kids were deep asleep.  He still hears running at night.

I have a couple of occurrences that did not take place in the hall.  I was laying with my 5 year old daughter in her bed as she was taking a nap.  No one else was home.  Her bed is in the corner.  I was facing the wall.  Suddenly, it seemed like something ran beside the bed, kicking some toys that were on a the floor.  I was still staring at the wall.  As it went by, it cast a shadow on the wall.  But when I turned over, no one was there.  Also, one night, I was alone in my room sleeping.  I woke up thinking to myself that I was cold and wanted to cover up.  My blanket was half off me though.  But before I could move, I felt almost like a tapping on my side.  My blanket slid over me.  Then I heard footsteps run away.  I looked but no one was there.

This last part was the strangest, though part of it does not take place at my home.  My son B, has always been fearless.  It has led to many injuries. -_-;  These occurrences happened the year he was 2.  He still could not speak that well and had trouble communicating what he wanted.  We were visiting my mother-in-law on Easter.  He had been to her house many times and never exhibited this behavior.  He started behaving very strangely.  He was staring into her bedroom.  He seemed torn between his natural curiosity and fear.  It caught everyone's attention and we watched him watch something we couldn't see.  He stepped back and seemed to follow it cautiously past us and watched it go into the kitchen.  But he would not go in there.  This is important for this next part.

A couple of months later, I had come home late from work.  It was raining.  B was not asleep.  I found him on the couch just sitting by himself in the dark.  I asked him what was wrong.  I want to state now that he still didn't have a great vocabulary, but he very much tried to tell me what was wrong.  Paraphrasing:  He said he was sad because there was a little boy crying.  He was crying because he couldn't find his mom.  He was outside at night and hurt his leg and he died.  He said the little boy now lives in the hallway and plays with the kids' toys.  But the boy is afraid of the grown-ups.  The boy is nice though.

I also asked him if there was someone like the little boy who lived at my mother-in-law's house.  He said yes.  But not a little boy.  It was a man.

We rarely talk to the adults in the family about it.  And we NEVER talk about it around the kids.  Why did he know it was a kid?  That lived in the hallway?

B is 3 now and no longer mentions anything about the boy.  I don't think he sees him anymore.  Probably doesn't even remember.  He also has not seen anything else at my mother-in-law's.  The adults in the family no longer talk about it either.  There was a long time there I could not sleep.  I still won't sleep with out a light on.  I always have music or some kind of noise playing to drown out any other noises I might hear.  And from time to time, I do still hear it.

I figured it would be easier to post a link to the pic so you knew the background a bit better than just posting a pic alone.

My best friend and I investigated a mansion in California last year. The owner gave us permission to spend that night and we chose to do so.

So earlier in the evening of the investigation, another investigator on our team took a series of 3 photos. The lights were off in the room, I was sitting on the bed that I'd later be sleeping in. I wore all black and wore no jewelry on myself.

His flash was on in these pictures.

We didn't look at them right away.

Hours later my best friend and I crawl into the same bed to go to sleep. As I close my eyes, I get the most intense feeling of someone wrapping their hands around my throat and pushing me into the bed. I opened my eyes immediately and nothing was there. I tried again, but once again that feeling was so strong that I felt like my oxygen was being cut off. I woke up my friend and she said ""Don't worry, you're in a haunted house, you're just having nightmares.""

I slowly agreed with her and closed my eyes again. Again, it happens. Every time I closed my eyes, I felt like I was being choked to near death. 

An hour or so later I finally fell asleep without that feeling around my neck. I chose not to mention anything to the other investigators since my friend had said it was just nightmares. I didn't feel the need to bring it up because of it.


Until one of the investigators (the one who took pictures in that room hours because I slept there) came up to me asking me to look at some pictures. I hadn't yet told him of the experience I had in the room.

I was shocked and horrified by what I saw. Even now, I still get goosebumps.

The first link you'll see is me on the bed. No edits. Directly given to me from the camera itself.
The second link is the same room but a second picture slightly to the right of where I was.

So I'll go right into what happened (pardon the horrible grammar, I mean it's baaaddd):

It happened in 1991 when I was only 5 years old, I lived with my mom, big brother and twin brother.  My twin and I shared the same room and since my mom didn't have beds for us we slept on matresses on the floor.  We had a lamp that stayed on because we were scared of the dark, we were really scared of monsters.  Anyways, I woke up in the middle night and glanced around my room; closet to my left, lamp ahead of me, brother to my right and then a window above him.  As I looked through the window this statue of an angel quickly approached the house, it must've been at least 8 feet tall.  I looked at it with amazement and wonder, it had long flowing robes, no wings, and held a tall staff with an open bowl at the top of it.  The entire angel looked pale like a statue but the flame in the bowl was real and flickering in the wind.  I looked at it in the eyes and the whitest light started shining out, it was really cool looking until light started coming out of its mouth.  That scared the shit out of me so I quickly hid under my covers.  From my right I started to see a shadow creeping over my body starting with the head, it was huge and I was freaking out.  But from out of nowhere I started feeling really good, almost euphoric, and because of the feeling I felt comfortable enough to spread my sheets out so I could see the entire image.  Once it past over me I was still a little edgy, but I remembered a girl in kindergarden telling me that diamonds fell when angels flew over you.  I creeped out my my face from beneath the covers and peaked around my room for diamonds...nothing.  I looked to my left at the closet where the shadow headed, nothing.  I looked to my right through the window and simultaneously there were two reflections of light on the wall beneath it, like someone was shining two flashlight beams from behind me.  I didn't waste a second and once again dived under my blankets, then I passed out completely the second my head hit my pillow.

I woke up completely under my blankets all sweaty like I was under them for a while and lift the covers from in front my face.  There it was right in front of me face to face, except this time it it looked almost like the fuzz you see on the tv with a bright blue tinge.  I closed off the opening scared shitless again.  This time I was really cautious and slowly opened the blankets.  I looked around my room and there was nothing until I looked out the window.  I saw huge balls of light flying through the sky going house to house and playing in the sky, it was really amazing.  I could see them flying through the clouds overhead diving and twisting about.

Here's the ""proof""

I woke up my brother.  The weird part he saw something slightly different, he saw green balls of light surrounded by smoke.  Either way he saw something so that was enough proof for me.

So, have any redditors seen an angel like this before?  I've been looking my entire life for a meaning to what happened and found a few leads, I want to see if anyone else comes up with the same result before I mention them.

The floor is yours!

Ever hear of this type of entity?,jeffmath,28,5,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/jxfot/calling_all_ghostparanormal_experts_ever_hear_of/,"I was in bed one night, and thinking I was having a night terror/sleep paralysis moment. I could see a mist above my bed. It seemed to have vines and electricity. Almost like an electric smoke. It seemed very alive. I tried to wake up at first but when I couldn't I convinced myself it was a weird dream and tried to fail asleep.  The mist then hovered right above my face. I felt drawn to it. My face went into it. I freaked out, causing the mist to fly up and hit the ceilng, swirling around from the force. The mist then flew along my ceiling, and exited my open bedroom door. 

This all occurred in the span of a few seconds. as the mist flew out of the open door my girlfriend sat up quickly, grabbing me by the chest. ""Something just flew across our room!"", she yelled. I snapped out of it and was completely terrified that she saw it too. She assured me it was nothing and told me to go back to sleep. 

Upon awakening the next morning I asked her if she saw what I saw. She didn't realize that I saw it, at the time, and didn't want me to get creeped out. We both saw it.

It creeps me out because it looked and acted like no other ""ghost"" that we have been conditioned to see. I would expect a ghost to have a humanoid form that could dissipate or float through walls. This thing had no form or shape but was animal like, as it scurried along the ceiling and out the open door. 

I have searched about everywhere on the internet and have only come across one blog post that tells almost the exact story, verbatim. This is unsettling to me. 

Has any of you on reddit experienced this, or know what it could be? I've been trying to solve this mystery for a few years now and can only find the one blog post, titled ""a haunting in wisconsin"", I believe.

Well, he unfolded it and nailed it on his wall in his bedroom right above his bed. One day, him and his friend were sitting on his bed talking and the flag fell off the wall and landed on top of them. Keep in mind, it was NAILED.

Our dad asked him why he was taking a shower and my brother said that mom came in and told him to get ready for school.

I heard these stories one after the other in a period of 3 months, and they all overlapped each other in odd ways. These were stories told to me a couple of years back, so I'm sorry in advance if i'm not able to clarify. 

The first one involves my friend, we'll call him ""Mike"" because that's his name. Mike and I had been friends for a long time, and he's always been one of the most skeptical people I have ever known. Deeply irreligious, he had a strong disdain for anything mystical or magical, and a couple of upside down crosses tattooed on his body. One night we were talking about the paranormal, about some of my family's experiences with apparitions and the long tale of my uncle's alleged alien abduction, to which he replied that he thought it was all a bunch of bullshit. ""I don't believe on none of that stuff"" he told me. ""Witches, ghosts, UFOs, all of it is fake, all of it...all of it except shapeshifters.""
""Huh?"" I replied with a questioning tone

""Yeah, shapeshifters. Skinwalkers. I've seen one. They're real dude""

I had never heard about skinwalkers up until that very day, and then he proceeded to tell me his tale. He told me all of the myth and legend around skinwalkers, the native american aspect of it, the shapeshifting, etc... Apparently in the mid 2000s there had been some mumblings around his town about people finding creepy shit up in the hiking trails by the mountains. I'm assuming this was in Santa Barbara because that's where he grew up, but I never asked. The murmurs around the high school were that there was some creature who had frightened some hikers past the bridge that crossed the ravine, and a couple of days later a woman on an evening jog had stumbled upon a very large coyote. Mike and his friends decided to go up into the canyons to check it out. The first trip took them all the way up to the bridge, and since it had been getting dark and they lacked flashlights, they decided to go back. They didn't see anything out of the ordinary but did notice the lack of animals in the area. The second time they took flashlights and made it past the bridge, onto the deeper part of the canyon. Again, they heard no birds, no coyotes, just utter silence in the dark canyons. The creek was dry as it was summer, so the sound of running water was also absent. They hiked for a good amount of time until eventually someone heard some rustling on the other side of the ravine. Mike shined his light across the creek bed and couldn't find anything. He scanned the opposite bank in search of the noise, until one of his friends yelled out ""stop!"". 

Mike halted and his friend again told him. ""To the left, I think I see something""

Mike focused the light on 2 yellow dots across the ravine that were staring back at them. Suddenly the dots started rising, and they caught the first glimpse of the creature. He stood well over 6 feet, and covered in silver, grey fur. The creature was facing away from the group, but looking back at them over its shoulder. It had silvery, long fingers that came down to his hips, and contorted face features. He looked at them for a second, turning his body to reveal a plume of silver hair on its chest, and then moved into the brush without making a sound. 


The group was visibly shaken, but they couldn't say a word to each other, so they decided to make their way back to the car. They began power walking, and then trotting, and then eventually sprinting in a panic. Across the ravine, a thrashing could be heard as if a the creature was making its way through the thicket. The group kept running, and the flashlight was dropped over the bridge, shattering. They made their way back to the car, where 2 of their friends had decided to stay as they didn't want to make the hike. From the car, they could see the bridge, and a shadow was standing in the middle of it. They got the fuck out of dodge as soon as they could, with the rest of their friends asking what the fuck had happened. 

The story ends here, but Mike did tell me that some of his friends decided to go up to the ravine upon hearing about the sighting. Allegedly they saw the creature, and it chased them all the way to their car, and kept up with them up until they exited the preserve, rattling its hands against a wire fence. 




That's the first part of the tale. 

Second part picks up 2 months later. I was touring with a friend's band through the southwestern US. We had arrived in Albuquerque that night, and after the show, we had gotten invited to a house party with some locals. There was a good amount of people and we were just shooting the shit. Somehow the topic of skinwalkers had come up. We had been messing around while in New Mexico and kept saying ""Don't say its name!"" whenever we could. Anyways, some of the partygoers had grown up on the reservations nearby. And one of these kids had actually seen one. Intrigued, I asked him to explain what he had seen.

As a child, he had been walking in the res' with his friend at night. Out of nowhere, his friend told him to keep walking. He asked him why, and he just said don't look to your right. Whatever you do, don't look to the right. He told me that he nearly shat his pants while walking, and after a couple of minutes, he gave in to his curiosity and looked back. On top of the roof of a house stood the creature, tall and skinny, shining a dull silver under the moonlight. It's long, skinny fingers dragged down as it paced back and forth on the roof of the house. He turned away and booked it, and refused to walk alone at night for months after that.

The moment he said silver fingers, my heart sank. I had never been a believer in weird coincidences, and this was just too weird to be a coincidence. I asked this guy if he knew Mike, and he said he'd never met him. 

The third story involved my friend Julie. Out in San Clemente testing out her new telescope, she had set up in the middle of a golf course near her house. Out of the corner of her eye a black shadow emerged from the water. It looked at her with yellow eyes, stood up, and walked into the forest. Julie packed her shit and took off. 



Over those 3 months I heard these stories, the absolute worst feeling was the coincidences between them. I live near reservations here in California, and I refuse to get near them alone at night.

Last night we stayed out of the house between the hours of 1-5am to avoid anything happening to us. When we returned, everything was in it's place except in our bedroom. We have a tall oscillating fan (the kind you can talk into and it changes your voice =P ) We have it facing our bed to keep us cool at night, but when we walked into our room it was turned the opposite direction, blowing at us when we walked in the room and our window was open. 

Mind you our bedroom is on the second floor and the window is furthest from our balcony. No one could have opened it from the outside. 

We were too tired to care so we just faced it towards our bed and went to sleep. 

Now things are getting weird. Both my bf and I are getting feelings of fatigue. We got plenty of sleep last night, (woke up around 2:30 in the afternoon) and feel fine but as we went into the living room to eat a late lunch and watch tv, we both felt like we hit a wall and got extremely tired. My bf looked really concerned suddenly and decided he'd rather play xbox in the bedroom. I didn't question him since I felt it too, but I'm still sitting in the living room.

So lets say that I'am being haunted by one particular Ghost. He's haunted me for aslong as i can remember. I've moved houses too get away from it but whereever I go, it never leaves me alone.
So what if i moved in with a person who has the same problem as I have. Lets say my girlfriend, and we share the same room. 
Would my personal Ghost intervine with her personal Ghost? Would they get in eachothers way of doing scary shit? would we be left alone because they are too busy trying to get rid of eachother? or would they team up and work togather?

Most things I hear I think usually are the neighbors. But this happened year or so ago.. 

I was taking a nap, and I was awoken by a knock on my bedroom door. (This happens, as I live with my brother and he always knocks before coming in or waits for a response before I saying something.) So I didn't think anything of it and shouted out yeah? My brother replied asking if I wanted to go see a movie. I said no, and that I wanted to sleep. I hear him heavily sigh as he often does when I don't want to do something that he does. So I lay my head back down and as I'm laying there I remember my brother was working. So I get up and open my bedroom door calling my brother's name. No one answered. I walk out and look into his room, as it is right next to mine and it is empty. I check the bathroom, living room and kitchen all which were empty. Thinking he had left, I go back to my room to get my phone to text him. I asked him why did he leave work early? He said he didn't and that he was still at work. This made me feel a little uneasy, because I know I heard my brothers voice and his heavy sigh. 

I asked my brother again when he came home, if he really came home and knocked on my door. He said he didn't and that he really was at work all day. He isn't the one to pull pranks or try to scare me or anyone.

But they are certainly notable. And I'd like to know why they happened. I know people have experiences all the time but mine, they seemed to be more personal.  The very first experience I ever had was out in Kentucky. I was working on a house for Habitat for Humanity. It was about 3 am and my cousins and I along with some people we met at the facility decided to go out for a walk. We started making our way down this long dirt driveway, that led to a mans house on the other side of the valley(we were in the smokey mountains) when I stopped to look behind me. I wanted to make sure people were with me. I looked to the top of the hill and saw a black figure. I tossed the idea out immediately. My eyes were playing tricks on me. But then it started to move. It was running repeatedly into the woods. The best way I could describe this is the lights in Las Vegas. The images are still but are angled so when they light up it appears as if the sign was moving. Well this is what it was doing. I was a little freaked out at this point and asked people to look in that direction. I asked them if they saw anything. They said no, and I was just tired and my eyes were playing tricks on me. But then I turned around. And whatever was at the top of that hill was now staring me right in the face. If it had a nose, mine would be touching it. Problem was, it's face was static. No features but I could make out expressions. And it smiled. At that point I decided it was time to leave. What do you think this was? Was it just my mind playing tricks on me?

Experience 2: I was in my friends trailer park around midnight. We decided to walk down the street to get some fresh air. Trailer park roads run parallel to each other and are connected at the end. My friend and I made it to the end and headed on the connecting road. It was no more than 20 ft long and had no street light. We both happened to be looking down at the road as we walked. I decided to look up and I stopped dead in my tracks. I saw a little girl, in a white dress. Her dress had stains on it, and honestly looked like blood. But I can't confirm that. I looked at my friend and said...""dude..do you see what I'm seeing?"" He said yes. Then we proceeded to sprint back to his trailer, because we were so afraid.

My last experience happened only a few months ago. The first 2 were when I was much younger. I was driving down a road that is known to be haunted. It was about 4 am. It's all farmland so there were fields. And eventually a dirt road. I looked in the fields and saw people standing in them. Shadow people if you will. Now this area is an Indian burial ground. When I hit the dirt road I saw this huge cloud of brown smoke. First thought came to mind was someone just passed through here and that is just the dust they picked up. But as I approached it I was sadly mistaken. It went from point A to point B in a split second. It zig zagged at my car and through me. Needless to say I was now in my friends lap. I was so scared. This thing was easily 10 ft tall and was the width of the road. It was just off to the side of the road. My friend yelled and said what the hell. I asked him if he saw what I just saw. He said he saw nothing. I had suffered from depression, anxiety, and a whole mess of everything else. I was an emotional wreck. But after this ""went through me"" I felt relieved. As if it had taken everything bad out of my body. I went home, and decided it was time to go to bed. The next few night I dreamed of this happening over and over. The incident. I saw it shoot through me and grab this ""black type energy"" from me. It would hover over my head and consume my body. As if I was standing underneath a tornado funnel that was about to touch down. I decided to seek council in a few people that might know a bit more about it. And they all said the same thing(they didn't know each other and they were all different experts). It was an Earthbound Elemental. A spirit that protects our realm from the other side. Combats all the really bad stuff. I was asked to check my ancestry because it was Native American, and I might have Native American in me. I was also told that they rarely EVER appear in front of us. Like it never happens I guess. So it saw something in me. They apparently need to do good deeds to become stronger in their realm. Call me crazy, but what do you think? What was it? And why did it present itself to me?",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1fie8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1fie8i/encounterunexplained_thought_id_share_some/,

On something of an impulse we decided it would be fun to make our own ouija board and give it a go. I am a very skeptical person and I am still trying to figure out whether or not what we experienced was real or just projections from our subconscious minds. Anyhow, we lit some candles, burned some incense and began. We started off the session stating that only good spirits were welcome. As we put our fingers on the handmade planchette it took surprisingly little time for it to begin to move. At first in response to our questions we got many letters that didn't seem to spell out anything. But as time wore on it seemed that the ""spirit"" became more comfortable with the board. It told us that its name was Joe Eckman, and that *he* was married to a woman named Jennie Eckman. When we asked him if Jennie was still alive he replied ""yes."" We then proceeded to ask him if he would like us to speak to his wife; yes again. ""What do you want us to tell her?"" We asked. The planchette moved over the word hello back and forth repeatedly. Then upon more prompting the planchette spelled out ""Joe says help."" This took us both by surprise, we assumed he was going to spell out hello. After this remark the planchette spelled out ""Did I die"" repeatedly, about three times. We told him that yes, he was dead. In response we got ""I am somewhere."" We did a quick search online because we figured we should help him move on, we asked him if he saw a light. ""Yes."" Go towards the light we urged him, but he quickly said no. When asked why he would not go ""J-E-N-N-I-E"" was spelled out before us. Our hearts sank. We told him that we were now going to close the session, it had gone on for about an hour at this point, ""do you have anything else you'd like us to tell her?"" The planchette slowly but deliberately spelled out: ""I am ok and I love her."" We then gave him one last chance to tell us anything and he said he was finished. I should mention that during the session we both became very cold and felt a particular cold spot near the table. What is now troubling us is that we can't seem to find anyone via the internet with these names. Are Jennie and Joe Eckman real? Were we being lied to? Or was it all made up? I'm really not sure.

**TLDR: a friend *might* have been possessed and here is my account and question.**

First off, I am a paranormal investigator and remain very much skeptical, including of this event. But here it is as a question the other day was asked. While it sparked some debate, I remind all everything paranormal is a theory, hypothesis or a guess. Everything else is the story. Here is my account:

I was a warm December on the west coast somewhere around 1990. My mother had attempted to raise me in a non-Baptist Baptist Church. Meaning, the broke from ABA but maintained name and influence. I rebelled until Jr. High. She'd take me since I can recall but the transients at the nearby park were more entertaining  than sermons and I'd simply walk through the church grounds to the park from first to 6th grade. It was 7th grade where they hooked me with entertainment, but I got into the gospel. 

Fast forward through my believing years one Sunday I picked up My friend K and then went to pick up C before heading to church. Normally he was spot on ready, but we waited. And waited. After about 15-20 minutes of our usual 'Donut run time', k &amp; I talked. I didn't know much of C's home life but they lived in decent apartment. K filled me in that C's mom was a pagan occultist and hated him going to church and they might be exchanging words. (Filter years of common sense learning, she simply associated Wiccan but to us then, she could've been Satan incarnate).  Cruising the empty main drag of our town at speed limit as it was a popular speed trap we started approaching downtown. We see this cute girl in her simple, yet girl next door,  church dress, light sweater, bible clutched in hand walking to church, presumably the Methodist church around the corner a few blocks. K &amp; I make a comment and C, in the back seat of my 1978 2 door Ford Futura! (Yea I was cool, not) leans forward over K's shoulder to the open window and screams putrid profanities to this girl in a growling voice we've never heard.  It was to the effect of a 'fucking whore slut covering her sins at church, we know what you really are, you'll burn!!!' 

K &amp; I just looked at eachother. Took me a second to realize I was driving 35mph completely distracted... Staring right as this girl was just stopped dead in her tracks scared. 

C calmly sat back in his seat put his head downward like looking at his bible in his lap and we both asked *""What the Fuck was that?!?!?"" (Good Christian response!)

C looked straight at my rear view mirror and said ""What are you talking about, I didn't say anything"" without even a raise in blood pressure or winded talk... We came to a red light. I looked at K, he shrugged, and we started laughing thinking C was messing with us. Though C kind of remained quiet the rest of the ride. 

No other issues. This week at least. Next week was Winter Camp. Four days of repressed horny Christian girls running around in the sexiest ski bunny wear their conservative parents would allow them to troll potential young men of god for a lifetime of marital servitude, in other words, one of the highlights of Winter for us. Occurred usually the weekend right after Christmas during Break. The camp was a remote camp not too far from the Yosemite National Park areas of California. The worship hall/cafeteria was at the end of a long several mile gravel road drive descending to a small canyon clearing with a large activity field along a small river/creek with a wooden bridge spanning 30-40 feet over the creek. The south side if the bridge the gravel path forked and about 100 yards to the east, female dorms. About 40 yards to the west, male dorms and then south of the dorms a decent mountain side with a good snow slope. The area in the middle to the southwest was the sled runs. 

First day, C &amp; K got in a large snow tube. Descended. In four years tubing at this camp we'd never seen injury. Somehow, right before our eyes, that tube launched straight instead of banking left with the contoured slope and slammed a few girls between C &amp; K, the tube and the tree. Two left camp early due to injury. One in an ambulance. It's ice. It happens. Didn't happen again though. 

Next day. Boys cabin catches fire. C had laid his jacket over the heater to dry out. He had no recollection of doing so. So we shifted cabins and made room as their cabin was uninhabitable, but still standing. This was during lunch. 

That night, Stryper, the Christian Metal Band was scheduled to play in the hall for us. At the onset of the concert C got very nauseous. So K &amp; I decided to walk him to the cabin. As we exited church staff, our peer leaders, stopped us, inquired and told K &amp; I to return to concert and they'd take him. Fair enough. 

Two hours the bands wrapping and a leader approaches them on the ""stage"" and whispers. The lead guy in the band says ""hey, I guess we can't return to cabins right now, so we're going to play a bit more!""  It was only 1030 or so, okay! K &amp; I got worried about C so we decided to skip out. As we exited a side door, intercepted. ""Go back in!"" ... ""But we just want to check on C?"" ...

A moment later we tried another escape, intercepted. Scanned ... All exits surrounded and blocked. Recognized a few pastors who were not at camp before?? What? 

We never got out but after the band's union limit was reached they wrapped, signed autographs chatted. Approaching midnight.. Still locked up. Girls getting ancy. Escorted walks to the separate restrooms about 30' downhill. Then we are advised a member is Ill. No names, can't go to cabins, quarantine. Let's break into groups and pray. 

We did. Falling asleep praying. About what? K and I made several escape attempts, all intercepted. We knew something was up. Pastors were driving in by the carload on the road to the cabins as fast as ice, snow roads allow. When K recognized his Dad's car, our alarms were peaked. 

Then we were finally released to cabins. At cabins told to pray for protections as we fell asleep. I still to this day can't explain the paranormal effect but out the windows of the cabins I started seeing white glowing floating orbs circling the boys cabins. Of course it was ""angels""... 

The girls reported the same the next day. 

I heard what happened. One of the pastors called up was K's father. But even among family details were scarce. It was the next Sunday a full week later church service was changed from sermon to a multiple pastor panel of reselling the accounts of the exorcism of C. It was a bone chilling account of violence, superhuman strength, God's power over evil, a list of the demons by name ""Deception, Lust..."" All the way to the ""Anti-Christ"" himself. Of course the hardest to expunge from his human host.

It was also the first time I realized the effort a church can go by belief and lie to thousands to use a bad night to sell God with fear to many. There were certain aspects that didn't add up. Many did. I had my own questions but their 2 hour tidy lets praise Jesus moment wasn't the answer. 

What K &amp; I knew, the other's didn't was that C dabbled in shrooms and other herbs. I never did. Had a brother who... Taught me better when.. But I'd seen it enough when I drove C &amp; K around stoned. C was a perfect target as well. The fear of his mother (whom I bet sued the church and did never let him return). I've had a chance to speak with C twice since the incident. The first was just a few months after. He claimed no memory, stated he doesn't know what to believe. Explained the beating he got. Was hospitalized. But unsure. A few years later another random encounter to which his memory seemed clearer but he was guarded to talk specific. He did make comments about never going to church again and no further episodes. 

The inside information I had, K's Dad second hand reported he was picked up and thrown across the room. K's Dad was *a lot* taller than six feet and wasn't thin. C was about 5'11"" and thin build. It would've taken 4-5 sober C's to move K's dad. 

The story, the physical evidence both to the trashed cabin and members present. All add up to a violent alleged demonic possession. So why did I still have questions?? 

I still do. First, if I believed I were possessed and freed by a church, I'd want to return. Embarrassment, yea I could see it. But he would have been a god among men for such a horrific story of redemption, he'd get more pie than the rest of us. His mom likely had a stronger opinion after the medical bills. 

The only truth I can speak to, is if you haven't seen for yourself, don't assume demons or angels are real. Even if all accounts by 35 people you know and trust add up, but you are still denied open access to the evidence. Be skeptical. 

I lost a friend that day because he got his ass handed to him by several trusted members of a church, put in a hospital, and when all dust settles. I think he needed a detox or psychiatric help. 

It was the naming of the demons, and the thoroughness of the list of names, sins and scripture used that even a panel of twelve men choreographed to tell it a certain way couldn't hide the shift in their eyes. No one, would talk of it after. It took a few more straws for me to leave the church, technically they removed me. 

I've yet to meet a demon actively hunting paranormal. Few claims, but no demons yet. 

Question everything, especially when the answers are handed to you on a silver platter. If I could find C today, I'd ask one thing: ""I want to know what you recall""... I already asked if he thought he was possessed. Oh and, what was his blood toxicity the morning after?? lol 

That close, that real. K believes he was possessed and the church events mostly true to this day.

Of course this place hasn't been heard about by many as it's just one of those local legends to scare all the little kids or at least that is what we believed before going there last night. The legend goes that about one hundred years ago three witches were hung on this very road, but seeing as how that would be in the early 1900's I find it hard to believe. We got there around 11:45 and when we entered the thicker part of the woods my radio in my car started spewing static, but we thought nothing of it decided to get out and see if we could catch any of these so called spirits. The first 30 minutes were dedicated to walking the whole road and seeing if we could get to experience any of the creepiness that everyone else had experienced there, but we had no such luck. That was until we started to head back to my car and we decided to make our presence known. We announced each of our names and told the spirits we were skeptical and wanted proof of the other side. They didn't answer to me, but as soon as my friend asked them to show some signs something started to tap on a tree right next to us. We thought this was pretty cool and good enough for us tonight. So we got back to my car and I decided before we leave I would take a few pictures which ended up giving me some orbs, but the last pictures I took is the one that freaked me out the most and made me get the hell out of dodge.
Anyways here are the pictures I took in order.

I have many of ""ghosts"" living in my house. A man who is taller than 6'4 stands in my bedroom door and follows me in my halls, I have an old woman who stands at the end of my hall and smiles. I have a young girl who runs in my room, then suddenly takes off sprinting down the hall and out my kitchen door. I also see my great grandmother on random occasions.

One day my mother walks out of her bedroom and practically sprints out to me and says that she just saw a man standing in front of my door and she could feel her watching him. We slept on the couches in the living room that night and she woke up at around 3 am screaming for me, because she thought I ran through the room and into the kitchen, but when she looked over I was still fast asleep.


A couple weeks later my dad is walking down the hall and stops in his tracks, turns around and asks if we see the woman at the end of the hall. By this point she's just vanished. we sit down and talked about our experiences.
I went to a therapist to discuss this with her, fearing I had schizophrenia , but she told me I was in perfect mental health, I only had a little bit of depression. She said that she also has experiences like this, and to think of the human brain as a radio. Each one is tuned to a different frequency, and can perceive different things. Our brains are tuned to the point where we can see ""energies"" that normal people wont. Also these ""apparitions"" target you when you are weak. My mother was able to see because her mother was dying, and she was upset. My dad was able to see the woman, because his father had just been diagnosed with a tumor, and he's not good with dealing with stress. I was able to see because my depression was getting a hold of me and I was on the brink of suicide. My brother was the only person in that house who didn't see anything, because he didn't have anything happening to him. The apparitions can also choose who they show themselves to. They pick those who wont panic. They are also disturbed by any construction in the house, or any sense of change, because this affects things they have known forever.

I then get startled by an alien like noise that you hear when two cats start to fight, the only thing off about this is that its coming from the lounge. I only own one cat, and the front door doesnt have a cat door, only one in the house in in the garage. So I jump up and walk to the lounge, only to be meeted by a cat shaped shadow darting across to the kitchen, and my cat is lying on the ground looking exhausted. I run round and see that there is nothing there, I checked all the cupboards and the pantry, checked to see if the window was opened, but to no luck. It looked as if it had seemingly disappeared, There is no way the 'cat' could have gotten outside or hid in the kitchen. I walk back to the lounge, my cat is now sitting, staring blankly into the kitchen, I start petting him, he is very tense, and he makes a soft growling sound as I do it, which is not at all normal. I picked up my cat and walked back to my room, closing the lounge door behind me, incase something was in there, It took me a while to get to sleep, but I did, my cat ended up sleeping on top of me, as per usual. I checked the lounge the next morning and there was no sign of the 'cat' being in there. Any idea what the hell happened?

Edit: Sorry guys im stupid and forgot to tell you about the neighbours cat, im on on my phone sorry.

Ok so my neighbours cat was a dark grey cat, which makes it all more creepier, he would usually stroll in to my garden, whenever he saw my cat, they would fight, but he has never once walked into the house, when he died, my neighbours were pretty sad about it, they told me once they had found out. He was a cool cat as well, he was very cute. I knew him since i had moved in.

We certainly have a wealth of words associated with them, and most of them have strong negative connotations. Poltergeist, doppelganger, shadow people, demon, etc. Reading books and articles on the subject yields, at best, a handful of neutral, or marginally good accounts of spirits. Occasionally there is an account of an encounter with a benevolent or helpful spirit, but those are few and far between. Even then, the encounter is usually trivial or of little significance. There are accounts of omens/warnings from the other side. Sometimes preceding a disaster or a life changing event. Still, these don't seem to be in the same league as what we see from the actively ""evil"" spirits. Certainly there is a market for this material as fear sells media. That, however doesn't explain the disproportion in all accounts. So why don't we see a more balanced spectrum of entities? Why don't we see active extremely good entities as we see active extremely evil ones. I realize this borders on some religious discussions, as the question itself begs some speculation on things different religions try to answer. I'm more interested in what investigators and researchers think about this question.",,False,self,t5_2qjxn,False,,,True,t3_1b888f,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1b888f/existence_of_entities_of_extreme_good/,
1362017700.0,21,self.Paranormal,19db72,I believe my high school band hall is haunted.,abbeys13,27,6,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/19db72/i_believe_my_high_school_band_hall_is_haunted/,"Hi there.  I'm a senior in high school.  I go to a small school in the western part of Texas, really close to the New Mexico border.  I'm active in band, and I think the band hall is haunted.  People have told me about paranormal things happening there, and I've had a few experiences with myself.  I just wanted to share, and maybe get some opinions.



I'll start with what I've been told by others.  Our band hall is very easy to break into.  The doors are old, and you just have to pull really hard and it pops opened.  A few of my friends decided to go to the band hall (""just for giggles"") around ten o'clock one night.  As soon as they walked into the band hall, they all got chills and heard a very distinct voice whispering ""get out"".  So they did.



Another one of my friends was in the band hall's bathroom doing her hair.  The faucet started leaking.  Again, very old band hall, so she brushed it off.  The leaking gradually got worse and then jumped to full blast before suddenly shutting completely off.  She doesn't go to the bathroom alone anymore.



Different friend was in the same bathroom in a stall after a football game.  Everyone had pretty much left, and she was waiting for her mom who was running late.  She heard the bathroom door open, somebody walk in, slapping their hands against the wall.  When she came out of the stall, nobody was in the bathroom.  She asked her friend who was standing outside if somebody had come in and she said no.



Band director was teaching a few junior high kids in the high school band hall when he heard his name being called, as did the kids he was teaching.  They turned, but no one was there.  Someone went to go look, and found nobody.



Band director was teaching high school kids when he stopped and asked us ""did you see that?""  We said ""See what?"" He pointed to the far corner of the room and said ""somebody was standing over there, and they were mimicking me.""  Someone suggested he was seeing his shadow, but it was too far away for him to be making a shadow.




More than once, all of the lockers have been shut before everyone left for the day.  When we return the next day, many of them are opened.




Now for what I've personally experienced!  When I was a freshman, before I had ever heard about the supposed ghost in the band hall, I was in the bathroom washing my hands.  I felt like somebody was watching me, but I was alone in the bathroom.  I tried to brush it off, but the feeling was so intense that I almost had a panic attack.




This past summer, I was at the band hall at ""drum major camp"" (I was doing the cleaning the directors were too lazy to do).  I was in one of the offices when my director came in.  He asked me, ""Weren't you just in the bathroom?"" And I said no, I didn't go into that bathroom by myself.  He told me he could have sworn he just saw me go in there.  But I was the only female at the band hall.



So, as I said, I just wanted to share these tales with the people of r/Paranormal.  I'd love some feedback, opinions, or perhaps logical explanations for some of these things :)

1361081471.0,22,self.Paranormal,18oilm,Some things I've experienced over the years.,peterpootereater,28,6,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/18oilm/some_things_ive_experienced_over_the_years/,"I have had many weird experiences ever since I was real young. I'll just share a few from when I was a little older.

My first job was at a grocery store when I was 16. One night after we closed, I was going to the back to use the bathroom and clock out. That night, it felt really weird. It felt like I was being watched and there was an electricity in the air. I hurried to the bathroom and washed my hands. I noticed it felt very ""heavy"" in there. I threw the paper towel away in the trash can next to the door and turned my head to look at the mirror. That's when I saw this tall white figure looking at me. It had a milky appearance and it was tall and thin. It had a large elongated head and black holes for eyes. I froze with my hand on the door unable to push it. We just looked at each other for what seemed like forever and that's when my brain was like, ""no thanks. You need to get out now."" 

My legs wouldn't run. I just speedwalked out of there and was trembling. I couldn't believe what I just saw. I felt stupid but decided to tell the lead cashier what had happened. Her eyes got big and I thought she wouldn't believe me but I felt relieved when she said that there have been a number of customers and employees, over the years, who have said they had seen what I had described too. It was always in the women's bathroom.

I never experienced it again while I worked there but didn't stay much longer. I quit about two months after that. I still remember it like it just happened.

Another weird thing that happened to me occurred when I was working for an insurance company when I was 19. I was just working there part time doing data entry in the evenings while in college. Anyway, one night I'm driving home after work. I'm coming up to an intersection when out of nowhere, I see this heavyset man wearing a 70's style navy blue suit quickly walking out right in front of my car and turning his back to me so I brake hard because I don't want to hit this crazy guy. Just as I brake is when he disappears. It was like he burst. Poof! I sat there in my car trying to figure out what the hell just happened. There was only one car going the opposite direction after this happened and nobody else. This ghost man just appeared and then disappeared. I kept thinking about it and looked in my rearview mirror but there's nothing.

Back when I was in middle school, I had to go to church camp. The cabins the kids stayed in were so old and creepy. After the bonfire one night, we were walking back to our cabins. I was tired and was walking behind a few friends but was looking down at the ground trying to make sure I didn't step on anything bad because I was stupid and wore jelly shoes. I was just following the sound of what I thought were my friends walking in front of me. I followed the sound of crunching branches but thought it was a little weird because the pathway was just cleared dirt and I didn't remember walking over branches and more and more of them but didn't bother looking up because I had some other things on my mind too. That's when I hear my friend calling my name but from behind me to the right. I looked toward where she was calling from and then in front of me. I realized I was off the path and walking into the woods. My friend asked me where I was going. I ran over to them and said I thought I was following them because I was following the sound of their footsteps. Instead, I was about to walk into the dark woods. I'm so glad my friend called my name because who knows what would've happened.

Sorry about typos and stuff. I have more stories but this is all for now.

It didn't quickly vanish either, they saw it for several minutes and it appeared to be interested in them.  Anyway, I was talking to this friend the other day after a while and he said he and a different group went back to Big Bend and had yet another experience, this time seeing three orbs.

Full disclosure, they *were* on mushrooms.  However, they all saw the same thing and my friend swears he's never actually seen something that wasn't there while on mushrooms.  He's always viewed being on mushrooms as more of a spiritual experience and thinks the mindset may have been necessary for the encounters.  I completely believe him, but I haven't seen anything online where others have had a similar experience so I thought I would try my luck here.

Summer of 2007 my grandmother was getting really sick, sicker than usual, and her health was deteriorating. My mom didn't want my brother and I to know about her state because she didn't want to ""frighten us"" so she kept it all somewhat low key. One night I had a really vivid dream, I don't even know if it would be a dream. It didn't feel like a dream at all. I was completely aware of the entire situation and in complete control of what I was doing. In this ""dream"" I was standing in a never ending room filled with a bright white color. It didn't really feel like I was anywhere, I just *was*. In the middle of this vast open space was my grandmother in her rocking chair. She looked exactly like she would on any given day: hair permed, dentures missing, blanket over he legs, glasses on. I walked over to her and as I got closer she began to smile. I felt afraid and asked her what was going on. She smiled even more and began to speak to say (paraphrased from memory), ""I'm so proud of you, you've grown so much and you're becoming a fine young man"". At this point, I'm still a little frightened, not sure what's going on, why she's saying these things, what's the point of this? She didn't answer my question. She continues, ""You and your brother have always been so good to your parents and know that they love you. I'll keep watching over you and I can't wait to see the success you guys experience"". She holds her arms out to me and I lean in for her hug. I'll never forget that, it was the warmest and most comforting hug I've ever felt, even thought it was a ""dream"". I kiss her on the cheek, like I usually had, and she said ""I love you mijo"" (spanish for ""my son""). I told her that I loved her too, choking on tears. I pull away and look at her, still smiling. She starts to wave and moves slowly away from me in her chair. I open my eyes and I'm back in bed at home. I felt no grogginess like I had just woken up, it was almost like a blink. I sit up, feeling completely awake, and look around. A few seconds later I hear a knock on my door and my brother walks in. He has tears in his eyes, so I ask him what's wrong and he says, ""Grandma during the night"". It was definitely a rough day on all of us, especially my mom. I wasn't sure when would be the right time to share this story with her, so I waited for about a month. One night I tell her I have something I wanting to tell her. I sit her down and explain in great detail what happened. As I'm describing the words that came out of my grandmother's mouth, my mom completely breaks down into tears. I immediately stopped and apologized, but she told me to keep going, so I did. When I finished the story, she hugged me as hard as she could and cried even harder. Of course, I broke down as well, mostly because it hurt to see her this way, I was afraid I had really upset her, I felt like a dick. She looks at me and explains that she was there with her as she had her final moments and spoke to each of her children, mom's brothers and sisters, separately. The conversation my mom and grandma had was nearly identical to the one I had in my ""dream"". My mom said it was nearly word for word, only that my grandma would say ""and tell the boys(......) for me"" because she couldn't see us. Then we cried some more. We haven't really spoken about it since because we were both freaked out by the incident but in the moment felt incredibly happy that we were able to experience it.

**TL;DR - Had a conversation in a dream with my grandmother who died the same night**

Do you guys have any *weird* encounters that you'd like to share? I definitely want to hear them
