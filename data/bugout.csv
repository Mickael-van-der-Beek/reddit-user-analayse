1371138586.0,107,self.bugout,1g9v4y,It doesn't take a natural disaster to expose how useless your BoB is,dblcross121,116,9,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/1g9v4y/it_doesnt_take_a_natural_disaster_to_expose_how/,"Two nights ago the fire alarm in our apartment building went off at 2:30am.  My wife and I stumbled out of bed undressed and were completely bewildered while trying to get out of the apartment.  We spent a couple of minutes stumbling around trying to find clothes and shoes, then another couple of minutes trying to find the leash for our dog and the keys to our car.  My well-stocked BoB was useless during all of this. All in all it was almost 15 minutes before we were finally walking out of our apartment.  

I'm embarrassed to realize that I was guilty of building a BoB that was tacticool and loaded with great survival gear, but neglected all practical aspects of leaving the house in a hurry. I should've had a change of clothes and shoes right there in (or with) my bag, along with the dog leash, key copies, etc.  I realize now that being able to evacuate on a minute's notice - especially in the middle of the night - should be step #1 in building a BoB, having the gear to survive for days or weeks on end should follow after that.

Learn from me... help me.,brotherashe,76,15,46,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/1eo50h/my_first_actual_bug_outin_woefully_unprepared/,"Today a giant tornado was bearing down on us. Direct hit imminent. Felt confident in my gear. Grabbed my bags and headed to the basement. Lights went out. I couldn't even find a flashlight. I realized then and there I stuffed a giant pack full of shit without rhyme or reason, as long as I kept adding, my confidence rose.

There were a couple of obvious fully kitted tear away EMT pouches on the outside. Swedish Wildlife Hatchet, Amazing knife, fire steel, bunch of random 'survival' shit all handy. But Where the fuck was my flashlight or headlamp? or anything I needed at the moment? I couldn't tell you. It was a mess. I was embarrassed at myself. It was obvious I had fucked myself over. 

The Tornado hopped over us. Literally. By few houses. Then left. Then I get a call from my parents. All of there windows were blown out, and I needed to head over to board everything up as another (less threatening) storm was an approaching. I headed out, BoB becoming a GHB. I can live out of this thing for 3 days! Right?! Yes. I could. If I had time to take inventory and repack.

But I had no time. And I needed essential stuff. 

The pack has spent its time sitting in my office, collecting gear. Read /r/bugout - Oh I need one of those! It arrives, stuff if in the pack somewhere. 

This was a giant wake up call for me. Never will it be likely that I'll be bugging out and arrive at a place to set up camp, start a fire, hunt some food, purify water, etc. It's going to be something simple, like a tornado, or a hurricane, or an earthquake, or whatever you have in your neck of the world. 

So. Test your pack. I never ran a drill. I walked around with it to make sure it was the right weight. But I never tested finding something quickly. Test your memory/knowledge of your pack. Make an inventory, and flash cards of each item. Pull a card, and if you can't find it in a couple seconds then it's in the wrong place, or you need to familiarize yourself with with it is. 

I'm glad we were lucky. All of the shit I've bought over the years would have been worthless.

Tomorrow, I'm going to dump the entire thing out, and try to make some sense of where things should go. 

So, how do you guys organize your bag? Do you label everything internally? How should I go about organizing outside (external molle attachments, direct attachments, etc.) to inside.

The first few versions followed the standard format: a mixture of hiking gear but heavier on tools and self defence.  Then a while ago while reassessing my bag I had a realization; bugging out is probably not going to mean going into the woods for a few days.  The things you will likely need are much more run of the mill and less sexy.  I realized I was preparing for a disaster that is was very very unlikely.  My gear, which looked very similar to many bags I see on this sub was suitable for a disaster or personal emergency that would last less than five days, force me to go out into the woods with a small group of people and camp, also this imaginary disaster could not be too wide spread because I was not setup for large groups of people all camping (and competing for resources).  What I changed in my philosophy is this: prepare for the most likely disasters first, even if they mean filling your bag with everyday items instead of tacticool gizmos.  This is how and what I currently prepare for:

**Most Likely**
House fire/ serious burglary/ injury to me or someone nearby / family or friend emergency
In the scenarios I have listed here I may have to leave my house on very short notice (something common to most disasters) or I don't have access to the resources I normally rely on (the things in my home).  This does not require any camping gear, or self defence gear (unless you are around for the burglary).  It does require the following things, and I firmly believe that this should makeup the base of most bug out bags and preparations:

* List of contacts and important phone numbers like friends, family, insurance, none emergency police, neighbours

* Cash and credit card.  The credit card is for traveling incase you needed to rent a car, or check into a hotel.

* Well stocked medical kit in easily accessible location

* Method of quickly securing my home so I can leave it for long periods of time. -&gt; Safe or good hiding spot in home, good locks, good neighbours etc.

* Full tank of gas in vehicle.


**Medium Likelihood**
Local or regional disaster such as utility failure, storm, or flooding.  In these situations you might have to leave your house on short notice, contact friends, family, and insurance, and stay somewhere other than your home such as a hotel or a shelter (school gym or stadium setup with cots and food).  The biggest challenge is going to be deciding when to leave and the actual traveling.  Therefor the next level of gear on top of what I listed above is:
* Compact, complete toiletries to make life a little more comfortable.

* Food; candy and protein bars for energy which you will burn up quickly when stressed.  Perhaps a few full meals that can be made and eaten easily such as in a car, or in a hotel room.

* Clean change of clothes

* Entertainment for waiting in long lines, or in traffic; book, cards etc.

* Phone charger for keeping in contact with people who are concerned about you.

* Sleeping bag, or sheets for comfort while waiting in shelters or for privacy screen if in busy area (think stadium during Katrina)

* Low profile self defence, something that you can keep in your vehicle, hotel or shelter without attracting attention.


**Unlikely**
Large scale support system failure such as major blackout, war, terrorist attack, bank run.  Although I believe that a bank run or other financial crisis might one day get moved to the ""medium likelihood"" category at the moment I don't feel it warrants it.  In this situation you might be leaving the place you live for anything from weeks to forever, competing with others for very limited resources, and not having much information on the situation.  This is really a different level of preparedness and takes real commitment to be fully prepared.  The bugout bag in this level of emergency becomes a get home bag.  The bag should contain everything you need to get to a place you have already prepared for long term survival.  You can probably throw away most of the stuff I listed above.  Instead pack load it out much like a conventional hiking pack:
* Good pair of hiking boots, already broken in.

* High density food, freeze dried is most weight efficient

* Water and water purification

* Shelter and sleeping equipment

* Defence, both discreet and obvious

* Medical kit

This last list is similar to bags I see many people putting together, my criticism is that most people don't actually have anywhere to bugout too.  If you are serious about preparing for a serious interruption to everyday life then you need:
* A place that has food for months, and equipment and space to grow more.  

* A community already established to help support you mentally, emotionally, and logistically.  

* Things of value that can be bartered with.

I know its fun to shop and load up with high tech toys, but the best preparations are much harder then that, they require discipline to update your contacts, keep the car full of gas, and not use the emergency cash stored in your pack.

**TLDR:** Most bugout bags are better for going camping then dealing with scenarios that are likely to happen.  Think of the disaster that is most likely to happen to you, and prepare for that first.  It's more likely that your house burns down then a nuclear war starts.",,False,self,t5_2s4l5,False,,,True,t3_xjvb8,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/xjvb8/the_realistic_bugout_bag/,

here's my quick list of things that might not be in your bag but probably should be:

1. cash, including small bills that will work in a vending machine
2. a keychain with a copy of every significant key in your life (car(s), home, etc.)
3. a copy of ID and other important documents
4. a small headlamp or other non-tactical light in an outer pocket that is easily accessible, so you can actually see what's in your bag
5. extra AA and AAA batteries, and 123s if you carry a light that uses them.
6. Advil, Neosporin, Benadryl, and bandaids. first aid kits never come with a large supply of basic medication
7. hand sanitizer
8. very small toiletry kit, with travel-sized soap and shampoo.
9. maybe some reading material, cards, etc.; shelters used to house evacuated people are often fairly safe but exceedingly boring and you could be there for several days.
10. toilet paper: bodily functions still exist in the woods. leaves take some getting used to, and might not be available depending on the time of year.

all in all, the most important thing IMO is to think a little less like a soldier and a little more like a backpacker. this is true even if you're planning for the end of the world, because your objective is to cover ground, and get somewhere safe fairly quickly. even if you need to have weapons, etc. available just in case, they probably aren't the most important part of your kit, and even if society collapses (I'm not a big fan of the ""end of the world"" predictions, but I admit prepping has a fun air of fantasy to it) you likely have a higher chance of dying from disease from not being able to wash your hands than you would from sudden involuntary lead poisoning syndrome.",,False,self,t5_2s4l5,False,,,True,t3_1gj6w7,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/1gj6w7/my_thoughts_after_several_recent_my_bag_was/,

It is a bit overwhelming at first, wanting to buy land, start growing food, get off the grid, etc, but then you wind it down to practical things:  a get home bag, or some camping gear.   

Then a bug out bag, and how it overlaps and how far do you take it?  How much food do I need to hoard or carry?  And water?  And a space blanket or compass?

But after a while you realize the most rational thing that will happen is a weather related event that forces you to just stay home for a few days while they plow the roads.

I live in New England and this happened just last week:  a driving ban on all roads.  Not marshal law by any means, but they really wanted to convey to people the importance of being safe, etc.  

And last week I was fairly ready:  we had food, ingredients to make more, plenty of water, ways to stay warm, etc., so I thank reddit for helping me get ready.

However, I have delayed buying to much mobile gear, I've delayed stocking and prep'ing a real bug out bag.  I ~~feel~~ felt that I was just being a gear-head wanting some new toys.

But tonight I bug'd out.  Literally.  I am typing this from a local hotel room.

Here's my story:

I went home after a day of chores to my CO2 alarms going off.  Not really knowing what to do (something I should have known!), I opened all the windows and turned on all the fans while I turned off the alarms and ""looked around"" for a pile of CO2.

(I know it is odorless and tasteless, etc, but I felt safe with the windows open and needed to see for myself).

After about 20 minutes my wife came home with dinner and we started to cook, but then thought it would be best if we left the windows open and went out to eat.

We stopped by the local fire department just to ask the pro's what we should have done and they pretty much looked at us like we were morons, told us to go right home and they would follow us.

So they walked around the house with a meter, but since we had aired out the house for at least an hour by then, they detected nothing.

They were fairly confident it was a defective/old alarm so they left and we went right out and bought 2 new detectors and set them up...and waited...

But nothing happened so we ate dinner and did our usual evening stuff...

....as my headache got worse. Then my wife started feeling bad, then nauseous.  Then I started feeling it.


TL;DR:
Whether it was real or imagined, we decided to not risk it and we ""bug'd out"", but it took well over 30 minutes to do so, all the while the fumes (if real) were building up, making us worse.

Each minute we spent there was potentially extremely dangerous but we needed this, and where was that?, and don't forget these.

We are at a hotel now and already feel better.

So, the short version of this is :  Don't wait.  Get ready.  Get ready to stay in AND get ready to bug out.   It is not only the zombie apocalypse that is on it's way, it is real life, every day situations that are so trivial and minor (or even possibly just imagined) that you need to be ready for.

TL;DR, PS:  Check your smoke alarms and CO2 detectors.  If they are old, replace them.  If you don't know how old they are, replace them.

And get ready to bug out!

In the event that something extremely bad has happened in your personal life (someone wants you dead or captured) anonymity holds the highest value.

Tails is an operating system that holds a few computer tools and can be booted entirely from a USB flash drive or DVD. On the flash drive option, files are automatically encrypted (strong) as they are stored. The internet browser works through the Tor onion proxy. Basically it works by routing your traffic through so many different computers it would be impossible to trace it back once it reached the destination. It is open source and free to use. Your info can be intercepted technically, but not by people you're avoiding, and would be without context.

https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html

What all this means is that you can use a computer to keep your head down as much as possible, vs. trying to avoid computers and government tracking all together. To say that internet/phone traffic is not traced is ridiculous, although it would be difficult to know its efficiency. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_(software)

The way the drive would be partitioned (in USB or SD card) would allow for storage of ID scans, family photos, and survival manuals that would be viewable on a ereader or laptop.

You could walk into a local library or hotel, subtlely put your flash in and reboot the computer making it totally anonymous. Perfect for looking up directions, updating your IDs, transfer money from a Paypal acct., or SSH into your home/work computers and initiate a multi-cycle overwrite (or even a thermite detonation on the hard drive!.)

Because of that I've realized that I have to get a water plan in place, and I have to get my bag in order. This isn't the first time I've left my house wondering if it would be there when I got back. So I've compiled a couple of questions for you guys.

What's the best way for water storage? I'm so ignorant I don't even know that water can be allowed to sit for months at a time without becoming stagnant.

Also, I realize that I won't be jumping into the woods. I understand the need for a self defense weapon as, my father was attacked by a looter shortly after the May 3rd Tornado.

I just thought I'd share mine and maybe get a conversation going. This is the document I have on my phone, my google drive, and printed out in my go-bag and purse. It's organized by most to least likely disaster in my geographic area (North Dakota). We put a little more trust in government/military direction than others on this sub do, but we are aware of the dangers of bad orders or contact/conflict with desperate refugees as well, and try to be alert for them.

We store our go-bag, mostly geared around apartment destruction in the form of fire or tornado, in the car rather than the apartment, because there's little to no car burglary in our area. The disaster we are most prepared for is crashing on the road in winter, because it is the most likely and most likely to be dangerous; therefore in addition to our apartment's-gone-oh-shit go-bag, we have a specific travel winter survival kit in the car's trunk and a backseat bag full of warm clothes and first aid stuff so we can get to those things before we retrieve anything from the trunk at all.
---

COMMUNICATIONS (all disasters)

* am/fm radio in go-bag

* charge phones from goalzero battery in storage closet or from car charger

* texts get through easier than calls

* calls outside disaster area get through easier-- lines less congested. [Redacted] in virginia to get messages to [Redacted]; [Redacted] to get messages to [Redacted].

* post-disaster, listen to public works officials and go to ready.gov, but take government advice with a grain of salt (i.e., don't trust blindly and put yourself in danger from other refugees; take care of yourself if you can)

* copies of personal identification, medical information, and coded financial documents in go-bag

WINTER STORMS

at home if heat/power goes out:

* run bathtub and sink full of water for washing

* fill bottles of water for drinking

* insulate windows and doors with plastic and towels

* do not leave candles unattended

* go-bag has plastic, emergency foil blankets

* use goalzero battery sparingly to charge electronics

* extra batteries for flashlights in footstool and go-bag

* if possible (not blizzarding) retrieve car winter survival kit: crank lantern, etc.  

* stay warm and bundled up

in car:

* immediately bundle up (backseat bag)

* retrieve winter survival kit from trunk

* tie bright fabric to antenna

* run engine periodically, not constantly; clear tailpipe first

* do not sleep with candles on; in fact, do not sleep at all if you can help it

* alert emergency personnel to location asap

TORNADO

at home:

* grab computer, keys/wallet/cell

* pillows and blankets to bathroom

* shelter in bathtub, surrounded by pillows and blankets

in car:

* do not try to outrun in urban area; instead find a building and get inside

* can attempt to drive away from it in country, but watch for other cars doing the same

* if close, get to a low-lying, flat area, leave car, and lie facedown; cover your head

elsewhere:

* get to an inner, windowless room on the lowest level possible

FIRE

at home:

* grab cellphone/wallet/keys

* close doors and turn off lights

* get out; stay low if smoky and test doors for heat before opening

* go-bag in car has change of clothes, hygiene and medical products, copies of life/coded financial information, etc etc

elsewhere:

* get out; stay low if smoky and test doors for heat before opening

NUCLEAR/BIOCHEMICAL THREAT

at home:

* stay indoors; you don't need your go-bag, you have your apartment's resources

* fill sinks and bathtub for washing; fill water bottles for drinking

* insulate windows and doors with tarps and tape

* use gas mask in storage closet if necessary

* wash body and discard clothes worn at time of attack

* [military family member] will follow air force direction

elsewhere:

* grab go-bag if possible and get inside, far from doors and windows, underground or in the middle of a high-rise, and insulate them if possible

* wash clothes and body asap

* follow public official's direction via cells or internet or radio, but don't put yourself in danger from other refugees

* [military family member] will follow air force direction

PANDEMIC/ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE/POTENTIAL SOCIETAL BREAKDOWN 

first stage (isolated cases):

* become suspicious and hygienic; study the threat as much as possible. what are the dangers? what does the worst-case scenario look like? what isn't being said?

* if appropriate (trust your research), follow public officials' directions to prevent transfer; try not to gather in groups more than necessary

second stage (sweeping cases):

* gather supplies

* keep safe, suspicious, and hygienic

* do not go to work/school/hospitals/other places of transmission if you can help it

* otherwise, if appropriate, follow public official/air force direction

third stage (pandemic/societal breakdown):

* follow air force instructions unless zombies

* if zombies, leave for the farm with go-bag, water, weapons

* keep safe, suspicious, and hygenic

* if gas becomes unavailable, bike or hike, staying away from populated areas

* upon arrival at farm set up defenses and food sources for long-term survival

I get bugging out. Getting away from the mass people. But some of my thoughts are, why? If everyone bugs out then everyone will be going to where you want to go. That defeats the purpose.

Also, I know my house, neighborhood and surrounding areas way better that I would know any bug out location. Even if I have been there many times, my house and neighborhood is where I live everyday. My house is also shelter, much better shelter than a tarp in the woods can make. I also have wood for fortifying, and furniture for blocking some areas. 

Also also, I have food and water at my house. Way more than I could bring with me, so why not stay where I have more food and water? 

I have a 72 hour bag. Basically its a camping bag. When I go camping I just grab it and I can camp for 3 days or so out of it. When I get home I go through and replace anything that needs it. But that's 72 hours, so after that it's going to get rougher.

[Pack:](http://imgur.com/a/RXxlO) I’ve gone from the Marauder, to the Pointman, to the EMR. Even though you can compress Kifaru’s packs pretty well I opted to upgrade my “all around” pack to the ZXR with XTL. The ZXR works well all year round even for winter overnights, especially with a large POD attached. That baby swallows up winter sleeping bags. For extended trips and winter multiday outings I still use the EMR. The ZXR and all accessories are MultiCam. The EMR and all of its accessories are Olive, but with multiple coats of tan/brown Krylon. The EMR served me well during three trips to Iraq. 

The modularity of these packs and accessory pouches gives me the ability to streamline or add volume as my needs dictate. Besides just looking sloppy it’s a great way to lose kit and get hung up on every stick or branch. The ability to use any manufacturers MOLLE compatible pouches is also a huge plus. I always use a few add-ons with my packs. Since Kifaru packs come with 27 miles of straps I started using Velcro One Wrap to tame them all and moved on to Web Dominators.

 When the rain and wet snow fall I protect my packs with Outdoor Research’s (OR), HydroLite pack covers. I protect the contents inside with OR HydroLite compression dry sacks. Definitely needed since all the packs and pouches have grommets. Should things get dramatic and I need to get off the X quickly I can cache my main pack while beating feet with the E&amp;E Pack detached.

**Medical:** My medical training is intermediate at best, most if it coming from my time in the Marines.  The most advanced I get is IVs (no meds just LR, NS, or Hextend.) needle decompressions, nasopharyngeal airway, oral airways, etc. Most of my ""real world"" experience occurred on the battlefield, but I'm pretty good with skinned knees as well.

Certs:

* Basic/Advanced First Aid
* Combat Life Saver Course
* Tactical Combat Casualty Care
* Bits and pieces picked up from hanging out with 18Ds. I learned more from these guys in a couple hours than I did the rest of my career. They're teachers by trade, seek them out. Very few of them would turn down a motivated person wanting to learn.

One thing I know I still need to find a solution for is water. Do I have some ready to go? If so, how do I carry it? How much? Any insights on this or the other contents of my bag would be helpful.

Guidelines:

- Try to keep it to stuff you actually have.
- You should be able to carry all of it.
- This is assuming that weather-/terrain-appropriate clothing is a given. If you find that a particular product is commendable, feel free to add it. It doesn't count as a slot.
- This is assuming that you already have an appropriate bag. You can give more details if you want, but it doesn't count as a slot.
- Things such as ammunition, MREs, etc. count as one slot--within good reason.
- Please include a general idea of the type of weather, terrain, most likely bug-out scenario, and types of region-specific challenges you will be facing.
- Lastly, how do **you** think you could **make it better**?

I guess I'll start.

- *Area*: Pacific NW

- *Weather*: Rainy and mostly cold, except for a few short months during the summer

- *Terrain*: Urban/Mountainous with tons of forests

- *Challenges/dangers* (listed from most likely/dangerous to least): Other two-legged critters, exposure, injury, wildlife

- *Most likely bugout scenario*: Massive earthquake or fire

1) Fire steel.

2) Ka-Bar

3) [Sawyer Water Filter] (http://www.rei.com/product/786393/sawyer-complete-water-filter-system-2-liter)

4) Large super heavy-duty tarp

5) Big water bottle

6) Compact 5"" x 10"" x 3"" first-aid kit (I'll spare you the details)

8) About a week's worth of relatively light, yet high-calorie rations

9) Marlin Model 60 (made in 1983)

10) About 800 rounds of varying .22 LR

11) [Serrated ""Spartan"" Swiss Army Knife] (http://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Serrated-Spartan-Pocket-Knife/dp/B00932EP8Y/ref=pd_sim_sbs_sg_10)

12) Small cooking pot--in which the food and some utensils are also stored

The area I would like to discuss specifically is shelter. I know many are minimalists, where one lightweight tarp is all they carry for shelter. That's great, but I may need something more encompassing. I plan to keep my BOB in my vehicle all the time, so it tends to be an INCH bag as well. [This](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045TDU4K) is my 68L bag. I don't want to skimp out on quality for gear. The ideal aim is to get the most compact/lightweight (backpackers style) gear as possible. Living in Canada, I'd like to make it as 4-season as possible, while still keeping it compact. Not sure how possible this is, and how likely I would really consider camping out at -30 degree Celsius weather (I guess one wouldn't have a choice!). I want to add value to the BOB, but realistically it'd likely be most used to get me to a BOL/retreat and/or when the car breaks down.


These are the items I am considering so far:

* 1) Tarp - [Kifaru ParaTarp](http://www.kifaru.net/paratarp2009.html)

* 2) Bivy Sack or Tent - [Integral Designs Unishelter Expedition Bivy Sack](http://www.mec.ca/AST/ShopMEC/Tents/BivySacks/PRD~4006-996/integral-designs-unishelter-expedition-bivy-sack.jsp) or a [Hilleberg Akto](http://www.hilleberg.com/home/products/akto/akto.php)

* 3) Mattress - [Thermarest NeoAir XTherm](http://cascadedesigns.com/therm-a-rest/mattresses/fast-and-light/neoair-xtherm/product)

* 4) Sleeping Bag - [Western Mountaineering Antelope](http://www.outdoorgearlab.com/Sleeping-Bag-Down-Cold-Weather-Reviews/Western-Mountaineering-Antelope-MF)

Both situations taught me something different, so I'm sure we have a lot to teach one another.

The first time I was a foreign student in Beijing during the SARS outbreak. Young and foolish as I was, I stayed in the city far too long and didn't acknowledge how serious the situation was until I was threatened with quarantine. I ended up slipping across the border into Mongolia then Russia, finally making it home from there. I learned how important it is to 1. read multiple news sources and 2. act proactively with an eye towards self-preservation. What I wish I had at the time: An n95 mask and a thorough understanding of the book ""How to Win Friends and Influence People.""

The second time happened more recently when a gunman seized control of my office building. I was in a meeting and didn't have time to make it back to my desk before we were evacuated. Fortunately, I had my wallet, transit pass, and apartment keys in my pocket so I could get home but I did not have my phone so it was a few hours before I could connect with concerned friends and family. I learned that when SHTF, your bugout bag is probably going to be whatever is on your person or within an arm's reach at that moment. What I wish I had at the time: A phone with 3g (to get updates on the situation via Twitter, etc. from those on the outside and to connect with friends and family immediately afterwards).

tl;dr: Mastery of interpersonal communications &amp; human relationships and having a smart everyday carry are incredibly valuable in a bugout situation.",,False,self,t5_2s4l5,False,,,True,t3_yjotg,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/yjotg/ok_gang_lets_hear_your_real_life_bugout_stories/,

Well, now I'm emboldened. Here is my ""stage one"" bag, which I keep in a nightstand by the side of my bed.

The ""bag"" is a [humble and very nerdy travel pouch](http://www.amazon.com/SE-TP101-Travel-Pouch/dp/B001MTUJRM/). In it I have a small zip lock-style sandwich bag filled with:

* A (second) driver's license 
* A (second) credit card
* A (second) insurance card
* A US passport card
* 5 blank checks
* About US$300 in mixed denominations
* A FAT32-formatted USB thumb drive with scans of all my important IDs and documents
* A laminated index card with important phone numbers, account numbers and addresses printed on it
* An unused ""minutes"" card to charge up a Tracfone
* An international calling card ([kind of like this one](http://www.amazon.com/ZapTel-Extreme-Talk-International-calling/dp/B002GCDVI8/))

In the pouch I also have an old [Nokia 2600 Tracfone](http://www.amazon.com/Nokia-2600-Tracfone-Prepaid-Phone/dp/B0077EX1GW/) and battery (I keep it separate in the bag). On one of the zippers I have a [little LED keychain](http://www.amazon.com/MICRO-BLACK-KEYCHAIN-BRIGHT-FLASHLIGHT/dp/B001I9EICI/).

That's it. Just enough to continue living in society and begin piecing my life together again if for some reason I had to leave my apartment on extremely short notice.

Last week, the revealed part 1 of a 3 part reveal, [Glock ID](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151344895316797&amp;set=a.158024376796.112283.106625151796&amp;type=1&amp;theater). 
* Remington will be showcasing their new [783](http://www.remington.com/en/product-families/firearms/centerfire-families/bolt-action-model-783.aspx), filling the budget gap between the excellent 700 and the disenchanting 770. Looks like it has a very Savage-Accutrigger-like trigger, which, in my mind, is a great move.
* Winchester's new caliber, .17 WSM. We're talking 3,000 fps with a 20 grain bullet [compared with a mere 2,350 from a .17 HMR].
* Ruger will finally introduce the SR45, a commander-sized SR1911, as well as a .22 mag chambering of their popular LCR, and possibly a .380 LC9 [not sure I follow the logic on that one…]. 
*Additional Beretta Nano models [good move for them, pocket autos are hot hot hot].
* Maxpedition is set to reveal a new line of CCW-specific gearbags [excited about this one], original morale patches, and the official launch of their Knives and Tools line. Let's hope, for their sake, the new line of knives has a warmer reception than their new Ferox.
* A bunch of new [Buck Knives](http://www.lawofficer.com/article/product-announcements/buck-knives-debut-new-knives-2)  
Make sure you don't miss anything, stay tuned here!

I have my own list of things to check out while we're there [and hopefully a lot of it will lead to better prices and new products for you guys!], but, if you have any special requests, let me know. I would be happy to make specific inquiries to any vendor, take pictures of specific things of interest, whathaveyou.

 Also, if you're going, hit us up! I hear Hooters has great hot wings…

There are three main components:

1. **Get Home Bag** - which is an [IFAK leg platform pouch](http://www.rescue-essentials.com/S_T_O_R_M_Operator_IFAK_p/30-1461.htm)

2. **Smaller, more mobile, [modular backpack](http://hazard4.com/products/packs/evac-slings/rocket)** by Hazard 4
. And finally

3. **The large ""when I have to leave home"" [pack](http://proforceequipment.com/product-details.php?id=163&amp;catid=28)** by snugpak.

*Contents of each are as follows (and subject to change of course).*



**The Get Home Bag:**
* seatbelt cutter with glass punch 

* K-Bar necker-becker knife 

* 16"" collapsible baton

* chemical flare X2 

* 2 large zip-ties

* led flashlight w/ 2 sets extra batts 

* leatherman multi tool (I think its the wave) 

* bandana 

* first aid kit 

* protein bar 

* 25ft paracord 

* small whetstone 

* compass 

* signal mirror 

* binoculars 

* lighter 

* matches 

* thermal/solar blanket 

* trioxane (fire starter) 

* pair of leather work gloves 

* pen and paper 
 



**The Smaller modular backpack (also camping slingpack)**

* bivy sac 

* mess kit 

* granola bars 

* water purification tabs (looking to get steri-pen) 

* wind-up/solar radio 

* small lantern (with extra batts) 

* more intense first aid items (larger bandages, cravats, etc) 

* 32 oz nalgene 

* 16 oz stainless cup by klean kanteen 

* bandana 

* matches 

* trioxane (fire starter) 

* 100' paracord 

* notebook and pen 

* ""how to avoid being killed in a war zone"" 

* sleeping pad 

* fleece jacket 

* Gerber LMF II with sheath 

* small crossbow w/ bolts 

* larger whetstone 

* toothbrush, toothpaste, TP, floss 

* [Maxpedition roly-poly pouch](http://www.maxpedition.com/store/pc/MEGA-ROLLYPOLY-FOLDING-DUMP-POUCH-26p233.htm) to carry -my [sleepingbag](http://proforceequipment.com/product-details.php?id=177&amp;catid=4)




**The Leave-home-bag (the snugpak rocketpack)**

* The center space holds the Hazard4 pack (without the sleeping bag) with room for extra equipment such as

* 50' rope

* large gerber hatchet
 
* sleeping bag would then hang off back, lashed to bottom.

* side compartments would be filled with more clothing, food, or other supplies.


**NOTE** - And don't worry- there is still room for ammo. (I have an AR-7, and a shotgun).

And the ultimate use-all-of-this scenario would obviously be 
be someplace with car (and thus the get home bag), and make my way home.
and then from there decide either to stay put and bug-in or head out with the sink on my back.

I guess for me I'd want 2000 .22 rounds, for my rifle and pistol. And perhaps another 1000 rounds of 9mm for another pistol I'd have. I guess after I've expended all of that, I'll want to be making my own ( which requires some tools I dont have ) or scavenging for more... 

Now, WITH weight being an issue... what's realistic? I've already got 50 lbs of BOB on my back. How much ammo can I REALLY carry? Not much is my guess. maybe 1000 rds of .22 and 500 rds of 9mm. How long would that last me?

So I started doing some research into desalination options (purely for drinking water). My initial feeling is that the Katadyn Survivor 06 is the way to go. At $1000 it's pretty pricey, but I don't see me needing to replace it anytime soon - or ever. It is slow (about 4.5L of water an hour), which means that for the wife and I we'd need to pump for about an hour to two hours a day.

I live downtown in a fairly large city, so my ""get out of dodge"" situation would likely involve a really long walk with thousands of others, all migrating on foot (think NYC or DC on 9/11).


With that in mind, I've heard it wise to avoid conspicuous packs in cities because they can potentially make you a target for people looking to upgrade their survival gear. I'd much rather my kit be carried in a laptop case or a messenger bag or something like that. Everyone will have one of those, so I'll blend in nicely.

One of my questions is do you rotate your stored food?

I was thinking that if I plan on having 6 months of food on hand, would it be smart to buy 6 months now, then in 3 months eat 1/2 the food as part of my regular life and buy 3 more months for storage.

If I keep this going, I will always have 6 months of food on hand, and the oldest stuff wont be more than 6 months old.

Is it necessary?   

I just see that buying a ton of food might (hopefully) expire before I need it (hoping I never will).

This would also lower the over all cost since I would be supplementing my regular diet with stored food.

So, what am I missing and is there anything I should to remove?  

I know I need a spare change of clothes in addition to my normal clothes (usually wear shorts + t-shirt if warm or sweat pants + waterproof jacket if cold).  I am thinking [this shirt](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LNCAPS/), [these pants](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058YW3TO/), and [these socks](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000TA74BY/), unless someone can recommend something else of similar price.

Also, what are other good kinds of food to bring?  The canned stuff doesn't seem that efficient, but I want something that I can heat up.  The bars seem good, but they are no hot meal.  I want something that has good nutrient density, but also tastes like a meal.

The guns I take will depend on the situation, I do have a concealed carry licence.

I wanted to create a pack I can keep at the office in case the SHTF during the work-week.  Unlike a typical BOB:

* It's not intended for any long-term sustenance -- just to get me home.
* It has to be small and inconspicuous enough to avoid odd looks from my co-workers.
* Due to building/city rules, weapons are frowned upon.

Without further adieu...
The entire kit fits in a nondescript black backpack.

In the outer-most pocket, I've got a few miscellaneous items (beef jerky, booze, lighters, spare batteries, AC/USB phone charger, first-aid kit supplemented with IOSAT pills, and emergency ration bars (coconut).
[First Pocket](http://i.imgur.com/B0tel.jpg?2)

The second pocket adds a few more items: a detailed map of Chicago (for walking home), a small solar/battery USB power source, a head lamp, compass, flashlight, knife (with fire starter, whisle, sharpening stone), and zip-ties.
[Second pocket](http://i.imgur.com/q3aRn.jpg?1)

The largest rear pocket contains a polar fleece blanket, 4 liters of water, 10 chem light sticks, a gas mask (with drinking tube), collection of rain ponchos, and a Mylar emergency sleeping bag.

Not shown, but stored nearby, are a pair of comfortable athletic shoes.

We just got our passport photos taken and there are spares enough for the BOBs. I was wondering what /r/bugout thought about the idea.

I'd like some critique on anything I'm missing, as well as anything truly redundant that can be removed. I haven't added in the specific brands/models that I've purchased (although feel free to ask) - but suffice it to say that this has been thought through. Everything electronic in the bags runs off AA batteries, and there's a solar charger to ensure they are good to go etc. When it comes to hardware choices, too, I've gone with gear like Fallkniven knives, Gerber torches, etc. Incidentally, I do 3-4 hikes every year that run from 3-7 days each, so all of this equipment is stuff I've carried on hikes, tested, and trust.

The bags weigh in at about 20kg's without water, which is a little on the heavy side, hence the question. I know I've doubled up on stuff, but it's really meant to be for any eventuality. But maybe I've gone really overboard with certain things, so tell me where I need to curb it. Ok, here goes.

I will be purchasing my first pack this week and thought I could use some input so I don't end up with something that I will regret at a later date.  Things I'm considering: 

Capacity, Comfort, Durability, Adaptability, Ability to integrate with sleeping gear, canteens/camel back. 

So far the only 2 packs I've looked at are the Large ALICE and Large MOLLE.  I realized soon after that I would need some solid advice from people who have used/owned and can make a solid suggestion. 

Things to consider about me/environment: I'm a big dude and very fit(6'4"" 210lbs). The bag would be used in a climate with warm summers and extremely cold winters so the bag must be able to take a pounding from the elements.

Any good resources/marketplaces, general advice would be greatly appreciated.  I'll be slowly building a bag throughout the next month so I'll be posting soon after buying the pack regarding other gear :D

I would like it to also function as 'oh &lt;insert crisis here&gt; happened and I can't drive home' bag.  The reason I want that is because I work about an hour and half from my home.

I have the bag I want to use, an old Navy Guard book bag, and an idea of a few things.  I have been reading threads on here to see if I need more or less things, let me know what you think.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

List:
+Braided Paracord (I would braid/knot it so that it could hang outside the bag to preserve space)

+One hunting/survival knife w/ compass, water proof matches, and a couple of fishing hooks with string in the hilt, bout 11"" long and serrated on side

+Blacked out divers knife that would be taken from bag and strapped to my person also about 11"" long

+Regular pocket knife bout 4"" to 5""

+1 set hot weather clothing (I never wear shorts so this is [removed] zip off pants and a T)

+1 set thermals for cold conditions

+1 good quality blanket

+1 inflatable pillow

+1 sleeping bag - attached to bottom of bag using some of the paracord

+1 box of pop tarts(between 3 to 4 packs depending on where I buy them

+Packs of stove top ramen noodles

+Box of matches (250 count)

+toothpaste and brush

+Hair brush (female with long hair)

+A few rags (I never see this but ladies, this is what they used to use before 'sanitary napkins' came about.  Just wash and reuse)

+2 Soap bar (one for person one for cloth)

+1 trap

+1 5'x5' piece of netting

+Zip locks (assorted sizes)

+basic first aid kit

+Plastic utensils

+Metal container to boil water

+extra socks/some foot powder

It runs on 3 AAs, and handles alkalines and Eneloops equally well. It isn't waterproof, and it certainly isn't a Yaesu VR-500 (although those are scarcer than hen's teeth these days) nor is it anything close to an Icom IC-R6, but it is a fraction of the price of either and it is quite well shaped and sized to fit into a bug out bag.

I welcome your feedback. The idea is pretty simple: Each bag extends and requires the previous one.

It's a work in progress.

The kit is designed to help me through progressively more serious and less likely scenarios, grouped into three categories which can be classified in terms of the time away from home they can cover, approximately: ""less than 24 hours"", ""up to 48 hours"" and ""more than 48 hours"", which I have labelled ""EDC"", ""Overnight"" and ""Bug out"" respectively.

EDC Bag:

I have put this together and carry it every day. I have empty pockets now and feel liberated. It's simply a cheap leather shoulder bag containing everything I've ever carried in my pockets.

Contents:

* tissue
* mints
* pocket FAK
* fenix LD10
* vic farmer
* keys
* change
* wallet
* carrier bags
* pencil+paper
* phone
* lighter
* playing cards

Overnight bag:

A small pack that will fit inside the BOB in the top section. It will be stored there when not in use so I don't have to scramble around to find 3 bags in an emergency. The contents of this plus the EDC bag should cover a night or two spent at a friend's house or hotel.

Contents:

* toothbrush
* toothpasta
* change of clothes
* hair bands
* hairbrush/mirror set
* deodorant
* mini shampoo
* razors
* mirror
* phone charger
* camera
* camera charger
* loo roll
* soap
* nivea creme
* flannel

BOB:

This is the bag I hope never to use. It's the least well thought out because I've never in 29 years of life had need of one of these, nor do I personally know anyone who has.

It's designed, in conjunction with the previous two bags, to cover me in case of natural or social disaster which makes bugging-in impossible. In the UK it's difficult to think of a likely scenario within the next 50 years that would necessitate the use of this bag. The worst we had was localised riots in London last year, and there's no way I would have ventured out with a big bag on my back if that kicked off near me. If the power goes down for a few days that's no reason to head for the woods; I can cook in the garden. We don't get extreme weather. Another problem is that once you strike off the obvious scenarios, the remaining ones are so diverse it's difficult to do a one-size-fits-all kit list. One bag to cover anything from local flooding to national warfare to mass civil unrest?

So TBH I'm dubious as to the value of a BOB and I think a bug-out-vehicle is much more practical than a bag, but for completeness' sake here's the theoretical kit list:

* USB stick with encrypted scans of personal documents, ideally including linux and windows decryption programs (probably blowfish, or maybe just a zip file with a password, which is really crackable but any computer can decrypt it which is handy)
* Printed, laminated photos of family/friends, with their basic details printed on the back (name, dob, medical conditions, last known address and phone, car model+colour, licence plates)
* AA batteries
* AA-powered radio (airband?) with headphones
* PAYG WiFi dongle
* Shoes
* Hat
* Scarf
* Cash (ideally £150/$230 but at least £100/$150 including change)
* Local 1:50000 map
* UK Road Atlas
* Compass
* Tarp
* Cord
* Blanket
* Lighters, matches.
* Stove (probably emberlit)
* Cutlery
* Trangia set
* Coffee
* Cocoa
* Cupasoup
* Dried meals
* Beef jerky
* Peanuts+raisins
* Chocolate
* Metal cup
* Tritan bottle
* FAK
* Painkillers, diarrhea tablets, hayfever tablets
* Second skin/blister gel
* Loud whistle
* Vic Huntsman
* Towel
* Tealights
* SAS manual
* Food for free book
* Bin bags
* Multivits
* Loo roll
* Vaseline
* Cotton wool
* Binoculars
* Glowsticks
* Foldable spade
* Prybar/crowbar/EOD Breacher bar
* Extra socks+underwear
* Large fixed blade knife.",,False,self,t5_2s4l5,1343901303.0,,,True,t3_xk0vg,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/xk0vg/my_3_stage_kit_list_and_explanations_long/,

My ideal food would be light, doesn't taste half bad (for my son), and has a shelf life long enough that I don't have to rotate it too much.

Is it possible to get my contents down to just a regular sized back pack? I am feeling very discouraged about this and not sure where to start....and I am ""over"" prepared with regards to long term.

*Med Kit for Me and Family.

Note: Having had 2 prior knee surgeries, it is imperative that I strip my pack down to the main essentials.....or maybe keep the same essentials but fewer quantities.

1349585608.0,9,self.bugout,112r6p,EDC + car-based BOB + BOB for a cat,thirtystars,11,2,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/112r6p/edc_carbased_bob_bob_for_a_cat/,"I'm trying to be realistic in planning my EDC/BOB for the things that I'm most likely to have to deal with- namely: a house fire, family/friends' emergency (probably a 2-3 hour drive at most), being stranded away from home, a tornado, or if minor SHTF at the nuclear plant nearby (unfortunately, I think I'm close enough that if there's a major problem it won't matter what I've got packed). When I have the money to spare I'll start work on a kit to deal with anything that this/bugging-in won't cover.

My EDC right now is my purse. [This is what I have in it right now or will have shortly.](http://imgur.com/a/YIutF) The wallet always has credit &amp; debit cards and my driver's license and will have cash. The levothyroxine is the thyroid medicine that I have to take daily. My phone isn't listed, but I always have it with me.

The BOB is a large plastic box I keep in my car- I've had a much smaller version since I got the car and it's come in handy several times when dealing with smaller things (mostly forgetting clothes on overnight trips or not having time to pack before leaving). I have a Honda Element, so space isn't a major consideration at this point. If I have access to my BOB I will definitely have access to my EDC, so I've tried not to double up on anything besides electronics and first aid. [This is what is/will be in the car.](http://imgur.com/a/yS6vn) I'll definitely be adding more food but I'm still researching what else to put on the list. ""Blue jacket"" is lined with Mylar or something similar and holds in heat very well. I plan to add a solar charger but I don't know when I'll be able to. I'm not currently putting together a walking/biking-based BOB because neither would allow me to take my cat, and I haven't listed a tent because I think I should be able to camp in my car.

I'm also trying to plan a BOB for the cat. So far I plan to include her carrier, food, extra water, two bowls, treats, a toy, towels to line the carrier in case of long car rides, a blanket, and her harness/leash.

Suggestions for things I should add to/remove from any of these three kits would be great. Guns aren't an option right now because of lack of money &amp; training (and they shouldn't be necessary for any of these situations anyway), but I might be able to look at something later. I'm sure there's something important I've missed since I haven't been actively doing much more than basic EDC preparedness for very long.

In particular, a couple of days ago, with the vestiges of Isaac moving across the country.  I was leaving work and the tornado sirens started going off.  It was dark, and there was a lightning storm and it was pretty scary and intense.  I should have stayed at the store, but I wanted to go home and be with my husband and dog.  Everything worked out and we didn't see any tornadoes, but it brought up the topic of a bugout bag, for situations like this, and if SHTF, and I figured the best place to ask about it would be here.

Here is what we have so far, just from what we've bought before deciding to make a bugout bag:

* Two first-aid kits, one small and one large-ish; the small one is in the car, and the larger one is in our closet, where we've been going when the sirens go off.
* A battery-powered LED camping lamp.  We bought this 6 months after we moved here, when the power company unexpectedly turned off our power for 3 days, when we had been paying them without fail every month.  They claimed that we had never signed up for power, which is bullshit, since we obviously had signed up for power.  The account was under my phone number, in my husband's name, and they had been accepting our payments for 6 months with no problem.
* A fire-striker my husband's mother gave us for Christmas a couple of years ago.
* A couple of Leatherman knives (just small ones, but something I probably wouldn't leave behind anyway).
* A bedroll
* Several emergency blankets

I found a couple of good resources online for what to carry with you in a BOB, like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/bugout/comments/s6q7v/my_bob_xpost_from_rthesurvivalguide/) from here, and [this](http://hdivs.com/ep-113-what-to-put-in-your-eeb-bugout-bag/) from Homestead Dividends.

My main focus is that I want to keep this bag as cheap as possible.  While we're far from destitute, I don't really want to spend $55 on an Alice pack, then still have to buy a bunch of stuff to put in it.  I would like to keep the entire kit under $50, if at all possible, though if it's not possible, I understand.  Can I use any kind of bag, as long as it's comfortable?  What is the best style to use and why?  I've had my eye on a computer backpack that I can get for around $12.  Currently I have [this](http://www.wengerna.com/synergy-12338) bag, but I use it as a day-bag for travelling, and I'd like to not have to tie it up as a bugout bag.

You'll occasionally see the odd bag with pet gear, passport, car and home title, meds, etc. However, every single kit looks like something out of a Davy Crockett movie. We're living in the 21st century people. Without further ado, here is my computer kit.

* Dual Boot Linux/Windows netbook
* Spare cell phone charger
* 1 full size usb cable
* 3 small size usb cables
* Solar charger
* Drybag large enough to stuff the entire kit into, plus enough extra room to fill with air to make it buoyant in case of flooding
* USB stick with important papers/photos/etc
* Kit sits next to my computer, where I can quickly and easily remove my external harddrive. (That's what the large USB cord is for.)
* Crank flashlight with usb charger
* 4 AA batteries
* High powered wifi adapter/antenna, because onboard wifi in netbooks sucks.
* Pen/Notepad
* Sunglasses, cause I'm cool
* Gerber with additional hex attatchment for phillips head and star shaped drivers
* allen wrench. Not sure what size exactly, but seems to fit most.
* Bic Lighters
* Butane saudering iron
* 1 car USB adapter
* 3 USB wall plug adapters
* hobo tool
* Wireless bridge/router
* 2 ethernet cables
* 1 crossover ethernet cable
* RTLSDR adapter for scanning a wide range of frequencies.

All of this is kept in a separate bag from my 72 hour kit. Phone stays with keys. If the cell towers go down, I can still receive calls via sip. I can also point a google voice number to my sip address. As long as I can find internet, I can send/receive calls.

Here is the list for my BOB/system. granted I'm 17 and I don't have a lot of money, but any advice at all will be appreciated.


Bug Out Bag- CamelBak Big Jump. (Yes it's expensive, I got it new from an Ex-Air-force sergeant, they let him keep his gear after deployment. A lot of my gear is from him.)
Inside pack- extra tshirt, extra flannel shirt, extra pair of pants, undies and socks. 3 MRE's, 2 packages of beef jerky, and Bouillon cubes.( Trying to fine pemmican locally, which will be added.) extra bullets,  large tarp to be used as shelter, ground tarp.sleeping pad and skinning knife on the outside. I have a wool blanket for sleeping while I try and find a compression sack for my Mil-Spec Patrol Bag.

Web Belt with canteen and canteen cup, halazone tabs, my Gerber sheath knife, ammo for rifle, A.L.I.C.E. buttpack with extra tarp ,Mylar blanket, wire saw, and e-rats. med kit, and drop leg platform for my Beretta 92A1

In pockets- Swiss Army Knife, Leatherman Wingman,phone, Wallet w/ID and money. 


Oh and I forgot to put  Paracord, fire steel, and matches on the lists for backpack and web belt.



I also plan to carry my M91/30 Mosin Nagant once I get a sling, and a cleaning kit since my ammo for it is surplus so it's corrosive. I know I'm not legally allowed to carry a long gun or a pistol but in a SHTF scenario i would much rather break the law and be protected and around here in NE Georgia the sheriffs wouldn't mind in such a scenario.


I've probably forgot to list something, but please any advice will be appreciated.

I've been creating a master list of stuff for a comprehensive bugout bag. Something I can have packed and ready should I need to GTFO, just throw it in the truck and head off into rural America. 

I've got a list, quite a list of things, but first and foremost I need the proper bag to accommodate these things. 

I'm thinking a duffel type and a backpack. Got my eyes on a vulutre/falcon II backpack for the massive compartments and organization and considering a voodoo mojo load out bag(http://www.amazon.com/Voodoo-Mojo-Load-Straps-Black/dp/B0091V326I). 

Actually that's why I'm here. 

The mojo seems to have it all, capacity, configuration, compartments, durability. But the cheapest I'm finding it is around 105$

For what it offers this is a good price I imagine, however...perhaps the experts know of something on par at a lower price point?

* I know it's a heavier pack, but it is designed for load hauling, and the frame can easily be used as a load sling even without carrying the [optional load sling](http://www.mysteryranch.com/hunting/nice-frame-packs/nice-load-sling). In a bug-out scenario that may be worth the extra 2kgs.

* The day pack lid is a nice addition. It's not an absolute necessity, sure, but it is nice.

* I prefer the look and robustness of the Mystery Ranch pack - I am convinced that it will outlast the Deuter in a pinch. I know there are some schools of thought that say that a ""military"" style pack may draw attention, but I think the NICE 6500 in the Coyote colour isn't overly military.

Although I'm not a Glock guy (At all) I think any in .40S&amp;W would be a great choice. 

***

***Compatibility***: This is the strongest advantage Glock pistols have against others, due to the company's popularity.
It can be converted to:

9mm

.357SIG

.22LR(with a special upper)

Parts are extremely common, and 9mm, .40S&amp;W, and .357SIG all can use the same magazine.

***Reliability/Durability***: Of course, Glock pistols have a legendary record of reliability, and the polymer frame is almost indestructible.

***Ergonomics***: This is where the Glock fares worst. For most shooters, the angle of the grip is too steep and makes it very uncomfortable to shoot. An M&amp;P or a CZ75 would fare much better in this category.

1911,
Hi-power,
CZ75,

Ideally I'd find one that was both exceptionally energy efficient, and reliable, but if I had to choose one quality over the other, I'd need it to be reliable.

Does anyone have any experience with these, or anything like this?  I could probably go with a chest fridge/freezer that wasn't intended to be portable, as long as it's something two people could lift, and transport, in a van or truck.

Under any normal bug out situation, well be going with the Dodge ram. Its a standard 3500 with a cummins. Its rough, tough, helluva machine. I know a lot of you say ""Fuel efficiency!"", which is important to me, but having a capable vehicle is more important. I dont want to drive a sedan when all hell is breaking loose. I plan on loading my BO-bike setup into the pickup bed. This will not only act as a backup, but if i need to make a run, i wont be using up precious diesel. 
I can load plenty of supplies for me, my family, and whoever else is coming with in the bed. 

In case of an EMP type scenario, i will be taking my Honda dirtbike. I can carry a load on it and have my INCH bag on my back, and carry spare fuel. (It will get literally 50 mpg, so im not concerned about taking too much fuel with it). Its a non electric start so under a CME or EMP situation it will be safe.

The first one is inside my B.O.B. it is more of a general medical/hygiene kit and will be inside my main bag with my other gear. Second on the list is my ""medical kit"" it has more serious medical and is an overflow for what I can't carry on my back. It is a sturdy tan burlap strapped bag with zippers, pockets, buttons, ect. It contains more/different meds and materials but also contains extra of whats inside my B.O.B.

I don't know much about medicine but have a general understanding of the basics. The kit I'm aiming for is more of a novice medical bag to treat injury and illness with essential tools and medicines.

The third would be a small kit with only a few things in it and would be quite small (pocket size) and would be kept in my car most of the time. I have not started making this one yet. Honestly I'm not sure where to start so any links to small kits or a list of useful medical that will fit in a altoids can or small baggie would be helpful.

Criticism is welcome, and advice/guidance would be extremely appreciated.
