&gt;Google Inc. (GOOG)’s services in Syria are now inaccessible, the operator of the world’s most popular search engine said.

&gt;Google’s transparency report, which tracks the status of Google products available to users around the world, showed a dropoff in Internet traffic in Syria, which is in the midst of a civil war. Services became inaccessible just before 3 p.m. New York time, according to the report.

&gt;Umbrella Security Labs, part of Web traffic-services provider OpenDNS Inc., also reported a “significant drop in traffic from Syria.”

&gt;Both Google and a Web security company called Umbrella Security Labs are indicating that the entire country of Syria may have been severed from the Internet.

&gt;The outage appears to have begun at 2:45 p.m. Eastern time, or 9:45 p.m. in Syria. According to a blog post by Umbrella’s chief technology officer Dan Hubbard, “On closer inspection it seems Syria has largely disappeared from the Internet.”

A bit more on the joint presser earlier:

&gt;“We are not interested in the fate of certain persons,” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a midnight press conference with visiting Secretary of State John F. Kerry. “We are interested in the fate of Syria itself.”

&gt;Kerry did not repeat the stock U.S. demand that “Assad must go,” although he said it is impossible for him to imagine how Assad could remain after accusations of atrocities.

&gt;“I’m not going to decide that tonight, and I’m not going to decide that in the end,” Kerry said.

Neither leader threatened specific retaliation in response to Israel's airstrikes in Syria last weekend, but Salehi said ""it is time to deter the Israeli occupiers from carrying out these aggressions against the peoples of the region.""

**[3:55 AM GMT]** 

&gt;Syria’s access to the Internet was cut on Tuesday. The most likely culprit, security researchers said, was the Syrian government.

&gt;Syrian Internet traffic came to a halt just before 3 p.m. Eastern time. Google reported a drop in Internet traffic around that time, as did the Local Coordinating Committees, an antigovernment activist group in Syria.

&gt;Four physical cables connect Syria to the Internet — three under the sea, and the fourth over land through Turkey. For outsiders to cause Tuesday’s outage, security experts say, they would have had to physically cut all four cables simultaneously.

&gt;That does not appear to have happened in this case, according to security experts. Instead, someone with access to the physical connections dropped the Border Gateway Protocol, or B.G.P., routes into Syria in such a way that any information trying to enter the country was not able to find its way.

&gt;“It’s akin to someone removing all the street signs into Syria,” said Matthew Prince, the founder of CloudFlare, an Internet security firm that distributes large volumes of traffic across the Internet. The firm put together a video illustrating Syria’s outage.

&gt;The same technique was used to shut down the Internet and mobile phone service last November. Syrian government officials said terrorists, not the government, were responsible for that outage, but evidence pointed to government involvement.

**Major Update:**

&gt;The Syrian army captured a strategic southern town from rebel fighters on Wednesday after a ferocious two-month bombardment, in an advance likely to result in President Bashar al-Assad's forces regaining control of an international transit route, opposition sources said.

&gt;The fall of Khirbet Ghazaleh, situated in the Hauran Plain on the highway to Jordan, came after a Jordanian-backed Syrian opposition military council failed to supply weapons to the town's defenders.

&gt;Rebel fighters, operating under the umbrella of the Free Syrian Army, cut off the highway to Jordan two months ago. But keeping the road off-limits to Assad's forces depended on retaining Khirbet Ghazaleh, which is at a crossroads leading west to the contested city of Deraa, the sources said.

&gt;About 1,000 rebel fighters withdrew from Khirbet Ghazaleh on Wednesday after losing hope that reinforcements would come from Jordan, which has been cautious about provoking a military response from Assad, activists and opposition fighters said.

&gt;""Assad's forces started advancing from the north and west and I can still go back to Khirbet Ghazaleh but I cannot do anything,"" Abu Yacoub, commander of the Martyrs of Khirbet Ghazaleh brigade, told Reuters by telephone from Hauran.

&gt;""Tomorrow, the big tragedy will happen, the regime's supply route to Deraa will reopen and the officers will go back and ammunition will be resupplied and the bombardment will resume,"" said Abu Yacoub. ""For 61 days we had choked them by controlling Khirbet Ghazaleh.""

&gt;Syria’s main opposition National Coalition on Wednesday said any political settlement to the country’s two-year-old conflict must start with President Bashar al-Assad’s ouster, implicitly rejecting a U.S.-Russian initiative for dialogue with the regime.
U.N.-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, meanwhile, hailed the agreement between Washington and Moscow to push both sides in the Syrian conflict to end the bloodshed and sit down for talks.

&gt;“The National Coalition welcomes all international efforts which call for a political solution to achieve the aspirations of the Syrian people and their hope for a democratic state, so long as they begin with the departure of Bashar al-Assad and his regime,” the opposition umbrella group said.

&gt;The response could be a blow to the U.S.-Russian initiative, which is based on an international deal agreed in Geneva last year that makes no mention of Assad stepping down.

&gt;‘We saw the whole incident,’ he said fighting back tears. ‘They were hacking at this poor guy, hacking him, chopping him.’

&gt;Mr Heneghan claimed one of the suspects had pointed a gun at his wife before they jumped back into his car and called the police.

&gt;He went on to claim that after the men had attacked the victim they dragged him into the middle of the street ‘like a piece of meat’.

&gt;A group of women then rushed to the victim to shield him from further attacks, Mr Heneghan continued, as the two knifemen stopped a passing bus and encouraged passengers to take pictures of them while they posed with their knives.

&gt;Greenwich council told Metro there were no new safety warnings for local residents in place.

&gt;""....when I saw this guy on the floor I thought it was an accident then I saw the guy was dead and I could not feel any pulse.

&gt;“And then when I went up there was this black guy with **a revolver** and a kitchen knife, he had what looked like butcher’s tools and he had a little axe, to cut the bones, and two large knives and he said 'move off the body’.

&gt;“I asked him if he did it and he said yes and I said why? And he said because **he has killed Muslim people in Muslim countries, he said he was a British soldier** and I said really and he said 'I killed him because he killed Muslims and I am fed up with people killing Muslims in Afghanistan they have nothing to do there.”

&gt;“He was not high, he was not on drugs, he was not an alcoholic or drunk, he was just distressed, upset. He was in full control of his decisions and ready to everything he wanted to do.

&gt;I said 'right now it is only you versus many people, you are going to lose, what would you like to do?’ and he said I would like to stay and fight.”

&gt;Syrian Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal al Mekdad called the Sunday attack on a Syrian military research facility a ""declaration of war"" by Israel

&gt;In an interview with Frederik Pleitgen in Damascus, al Mekdad said the attack represented an alliance between Islamic terrorists and Israel. He added that Syria would retaliate against Israel in its own time and way.

&gt;The Israeli military did not comment on the U.S. claim of an airstrike. But Israel has long said it would target any transfer of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups, as well as at any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel.

&gt;""We are watching everything when it comes to the movement of these types of weapons. We have the means to do that,"" a senior Israeli defense official told CNN's Sara Sidner. The official is not authorized to speak to the media.

&gt;While no official casualty number has been made public, rumors on Syrian social media say that at least 300 soldiers stationed at Mount Qasioun have been killed and hundreds of others injured, Mawazini said. Many Syrians are calling for retaliation as the possibility of a full-scale war with Israel is speculated upon.

&gt;During the attack, one Israeli jet was reportedly shot down by Syria's Air Force, according to Hezbollah's Manar TV channel, citing security sources in Damascus. Two Israeli pilots of the downed IDF jet have been taken to a military area in Damascus under Assad’s control, according to reports in Lebanese and Syrian media.

""Secondary explosions continued for about four hours.  They shook all of Damascus. There was still smoke in the air as the sun came up.”

&gt;From its Damascus media office, the Free Syrian Army listed 9 apparent targets, including the Syrian Revolutionary Guard, the 104th brigade headquarters, a weapons depot in Qasyoun and a military research center at Jamraya.

&gt;The FSA said power was cut in parts of Damascus at 1:48 am local time Sunday (6:48 p.m. Saturday ET). A FSA spokesman said the fires and explosions ""made Damascus look like the day at night.""

News Conference by Syrian Information Minister Omran Zoabi, via Al-Jazeera stream: 

(My own transcription; a bit rough. The translator was a bit tough to follow)

&gt;The Israeli aggressive attack on Syria, using missiles to attack military facilities in violation of all international laws. Violating all commitments and concern. The Gov't of Syria asserts that this open the door to any possibility. The proponent of the element against Syria, the Takfiris and the Zionists. 

&gt;The Syrian government affirmed this link a long time ago. The link between the takfiri ideology and Zionism. The Syrian government has presented evidence about this. This latest attack is more evidence, coming at a time when Syria is fighting terrorism funded by some Arab countries. Israel has proved by this attack that it is linked to the Takfiri groups. We urge the international community; the situation is becoming more dangerous. Our state doesn't allow this to happen. Israel and its allies cannot play with the destiny of Syria. Syria has affirmed the progress of the army in fighting all groups. It has the right to protect the state and the people, internal or external, by all means. Long live Syria... [Indiscernible] 

&gt;We are all in a state of anger. It is not just a single attack. It is practiced daily by the terrorist groups on the ground. When we talk about the connection between Israel and these terrorist groups on the ground, everything has become clear. [Indiscernible]  All these questions are on the table, in all cases.

Takfiri is an Islamic term meaning one who has turned against one's own people and religion, from my understanding. Please correct me if I am mistaken.

&gt;Amid reports of a second Israeli airstrike on Syria over the weekend, an Iraqi Shiite leader on Sunday urged Damascus to retaliate against Israel and called on his followers to defend Syria’s prestige in the face of alleged Israeli aggression.

&gt;Analysts said the call by Muqtada al-Sadr was unlikely to translate into concrete action by Iraqis, but suggested that the reported Israeli strikes could provide the Shiite powers — Hezbollah and Iran in particular — with a means of turning attention away from their intervention in Syria.

&gt;A militia commander-turned-politician who led a guerrilla war against American and allied forces with his Mahdi Army, Sadr spent three years of self-imposed exile in Iran before returning to Iraq in 2011. His political party, the Sadr Movement, holds 40 seats in Iraq’s 325-seat parliament and is widely regarded as an Iranian client. 

&gt;According to the Iraqi newspaper Shafaaq, Sadr “ordered his resistance fighters to respond to the Israeli shelling [of] Syria.”

&gt;While the likelihood of an Arab world united against Israel is virtually nil, it could prompt the unification of Shiite Muslims against the Jewish State — Iran included, Professor Moshe Maoz of Hebrew University told The Times of Israel.

&gt;Egypt's president condemns the alleged Israeli airstrikes against Syria, calling them a violation of International law and warning they complicate the ongoing civil war in that country. Sunday's statement Sunday from President Mohammed Morsi's office says Egypt ""strongly objects"" to the bloodshed and the use of Syria's military against its people. But it also rejects the violation of Syrian sovereignty and ""exploiting its internal crisis under whatever pretext."" It says the Israeli attacks ""increase the complexity of the situation."" Egypt launched an Arab bid to bring a peaceful end to the 2-year-old civil war that pits President Bashar Assad against rebels trying to oust him, but little came of it. Morsi's office says the Israeli attacks are a ""real test"" for the international community's commitment to respecting international law.

&gt;A look at the missiles reportedly targeted in Syria, via AP

&gt;Israel has carried out airstrikes against Syria twice in the past three days, targeting what officials say are shipments of highly accurate, Iranian-made guided missiles known as Fateh-110s believed to be on their way to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group. Here are some details about the missile:

&gt;The Fateh-110, or ""Conqueror"" in Farsi, is a short-range ballistic missile developed by Iran and first put into service in 2002. The Islamic Republic unveiled an upgraded version last year that improved the weapon's accuracy and increased its range to 300 kilometers (185 miles). Iranian Defense Minister Gen. Ahmad Vahidi said at the time that the solid-fueled missile could strike with precision, making it the most accurate weapon of its kind in Iran's arsenal.

&gt;Israel decided Sunday afternoon to close its airspace in the North to civilian air traffic following alleged Israeli air strikes on Syria in the past 48 hours, Channel 2 reported.

&gt;The report cited a statement from Israeli airline Arkia as saying **""due to IDF instructions on the closure of airspace in the North until May 9, Arkia is forced to announce the cancellation of interior flights from Haifa to Eilat.""**

&gt;The alleged closure of Israel's airspace in the North came after the IDF deployed two Iron Dome batteries in northern cities due to tensions with Syria following the alleged IAF air strikes.

&gt; The United States believes Israel has conducted an airstrike into Syria, two U.S. officials tell CNN.
&gt;U.S. and Western intelligence agencies are reviewing classified data showing Israel most likely conducted a strike in the Thursday-Friday time frame, according to both officials. This is the same time frame that the U.S. collected additional data showing Israel was flying a high number of warplanes over Lebanon.
&gt;One official said the United States had limited information so far and could not yet confirm those are the specific warplanes that conducted a strike. Based on initial indications, the U.S. does not believe Israeli warplanes entered Syrian airspace to conduct the strikes.
&gt;Both officials said there is no reason to believe Israel struck at a chemical weapons storage facilities. The Israelis have long said they would strike at any targets that prove to be the transfer of any kinds of weapons to Hezbollah or other terrorist groups, as well as at any effort to smuggle Syrian weapons into Lebanon that could threaten Israel.
&gt;The Lebanese army website listed 16 flights by Israeli warplanes penetrating Lebanon's airspace from Thursday evening through Friday afternoon local time.
&gt;The Israeli military had no comment. But a source in the Israeli defense establishment told CNN's Sara Sidner, ""We will do whatever is necessary to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to terrorist organizations. We have done it in the past and we will do it if necessary the future.""

&gt;Following a week of increased Israeli Air Force activity over Lebanon, Israel reportedly struck Syrian targets with their air force either Thursday or Friday the 26th of April.

&gt;Initial reports said the target was a chemical weapons facility, which was under siege by rebels at the time and had sustained no reported damage. Instead, according to CNN reports, it looks like Israel may have struck another convoy containing possible transfer of weapons — just like the last air strike.

&gt;""We will do whatever is necessary to stop the transfer of weapons from Syria to terrorist organizations. We have done it in the past and we will do it if necessary the future,"" an unnamed source told CNN's Sara Sidner.

&gt;And just as they did in the last strike, Netanyahu had told his staff to remain silent on the matter.

[7:56 PM CST] Israel strikes Syria to keep ‘game-changing weaponry’ from reaching Hezbollah

[7:57PM CST] Israeli launch airstrikes into Syria, possibly targeting delivery systems for chemical weapons, US officials say

&gt;It’s believed the primary target was a shipment of weapons headed for Hezbollah in Lebanon, they said. A senior U.S. official said the airstrikes were believed to be related to delivery systems for chemical weapons.

&gt;This would be the second time this year Israel conducted airstrikes inside Syria. In January, Israeli fighter jets attacked a convoy of sophisticated anti-aircraft missiles believed on their way to Hezbollah.  

&gt;Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon publicly acknowledged the January airstrike inside Syria in a joint press conference with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel in Tel Aviv on April 22. Ya’alon said any Syrian delivery of sophisticated weapons to rogue elements like Hezbollah would be a “red line” for Israel and “when they crossed this red line, we operated. We acted.”

**Israeli officials confirm IAF strike targeting missiles headed for Hezbollah: Officials say shipment not of chemical arms, but of 'game changing' weapons from Syria.**

&gt;The officials said the shipment was not of chemical arms, but of ""game changing"" weapons bound for the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group. They say the airstrike was early Friday. They did not say where it took place.

&gt;The attack took place on Friday after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet approved it in a secret meeting on Thursday night, a security source in the region told Reuters on condition of anonymity.

&gt;Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly warned in recent weeks that Israel would be prepared to take military action if chemical weapons or other arms were to reach Hezbollah.

&gt;The Israeli air force has so-called ""standoff"" bombs that coast dozens of kilometers (miles) across ground to their targets once fired. That could, in theory, allow Israel to attack Syria from its own turf or from neighboring Lebanon.

&gt;Israeli warplanes have bombed a convoy carrying missiles from Syria to Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, Israeli officials said.

&gt;The air strike, which is understood to have been carried out from Lebanese airspace, took place on Friday after the prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and his security cabinet approved the attack in a secret meeting on Thursday night.

&gt;The target was a convoy carrying a shipment of advanced long-range ground-to-ground missiles to Hezbollah and not a Syrian chemical weapons facility, according to unnamed Israeli officials.

&gt;The attack was first reported in the US media on Friday, with US officials claiming the Israelis had hit a building.

&gt; The airstrike that Israeli warplanes carried out in Syria was directed at a shipment of advanced surface-to-surface missiles from Iran that Israel believed was intended for Hezbollah, the militant Lebanese organization, American officials said Saturday.

&gt;It was the second time in four months that Israel had carried out an attack in foreign territory aimed at disrupting the pipeline of weapons from Iran to Hezbollah. The missiles, known as Fateh-110s, had been sent to Syria by Iran and were being stored at an airport in Damascus when they were struck in the attack, according to an American official.

&gt;Syrians with knowledge of security and military matters confirmed the strike, which took place overnight Thursday, saying that Iran had sent arms and rockets to Damascus International Airport intending to resend them to Hezbollah.

&gt;When Israeli warplanes struck what is thought to have been Iranian missiles intended for Hezbollah in Damascus earlier this month, Assad's forces did not respond.

&gt;But yesterday Syrian foreign minister, Walid al-Moallem, told Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV that his government ""will retaliate immediately"" if Israel strikes Syrian soil again, Damascus's most serious threat yet.

&gt;Silvan Shalom, a cabinet minister from Israeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu's party, told Israel Radio today that Israel would ""take actions"" to make sure the S-300s do not reach rogue groups.

&gt;Two days ago defence minister Moshe Yaalon said:

&gt;""Regarding the S-300, the matter obviously came up because of Russia's intention to provide Syria with this missile system. Clearly this move is a threat to us, even though at this point I cannot say that there is a step-up in the shipment of the S-300. The deliveries have not taken place, I can attest to this, and I hope they do not. But if, by some misfortune, they arrive in Syria, we will know what to do.""

&gt;Reuters is reporting that the Syrian National Coalition umbrella opposition group has agreed to admit a liberal bloc in order to broaden its Islamist-dominated ranks.

&gt;Yesterday’s statement from four opposition factions – the Syrian Revolution General Commission, the Local Co-ordination Committees in Syria, the Syrian Revolution Coordinators' Union, and the Supreme Council for the Leadership of the Syrian Revolution – complained that “the recent attempt to expand membership in the SC is no more than a feeble attempt to add persons and groups that have no real impact on the revolution, and we reject this attempt”. The statement described itself as a “final warning” – presumably of the groups’ intent to leave the umbrella of the SNC. I have contacted the LCCS to ask them if it was liberal groups they objected to and will post their reply when I get it.

&gt;Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah has ordered Palestinian Islamist group Hamas out of Lebanon effective immediately, the Middle East Online news agency reported on Thursday.

&gt;The move, the report says, is due to Hamas support for the opposition forces fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar Assad. Both Hezbollah and Syria are allies of Iran, which provides the two with financial and military support.

&gt;Hamas representative in Lebanon Ali Baraka denied the report to Lebanese paper Aliwaa, saying Hezbollah officials in Lebanon were were surprised by the report.

&gt;Lebanese Islamic Jihad representative Abu Imad Rifai also stressed to the paper that Hamas remains in Lebanon and that no changes have been made.

&gt;Hamas has denied any support for the Syrian rebels, but the Times of London reported last month that Hamas' military unit has broken ties with Assad, and has begun training members of the opposition’s Free Syrian Army in Damascus.

&gt;Hamas is a Sunni Muslim organization, as are the Syrian opposition forces. Hezbollah and Iran are both Shi'ite Muslim.

&gt;Even so, Hamas long enjoyed Syrian patronage, with political leader Khaled Mashaal basing himself in Damascus. In 2012, however, Mashaal relocated to Qatar, citing the ongoing conflict in Syria, which is now entering its third year. But the London-based Arabic language newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat said at the time that the move was due to Hamas' support for the Syrian opposition. There were also reports at the time that all senior Hamas operatives in Syria had quietly relocated to various other Arab states, including Egypt and Jordan.

We will target markets, schools, public institutions, and parks.""

&gt;Comment: The term rejectionist is a derogatory description of the Shiites, Hizballah. Syrian opposition sources claim fierce fighting is occurring in al Qusayr, Syria, which is close to the northeastern Lebanon border. Hizballah is fighting in support of the Syrian army forces.

&gt;The significance of the statement is that it means al Qaida could have a franchise operating in Lebanon by next week. The Al-Nusrah Front has the capability to carry out this threat and spread the Syrian fighting deeper into Lebanon.

&gt;Turkish troops fired into Syria after one of its armored vehicles patrolling the border came under fire from unidentified gunmen, the Turkish military said on Thursday.

&gt;The troops returned fire after three to five gunmen shot between 15 and 20 rounds at the vehicle patrolling a stretch of the shared border in Turkey's southern Hatay province on Wednesday afternoon, it said. There were no Turkish troop casualties.

&gt;Syrian President Bashar Assad says his forces will respond to any future Israeli strike on his country.

&gt;Assad spoke in an interview broadcast Thursday on Al-Manar, a TV station owned by the Lebanese militia Hezbollah, a close ally.

&gt;Israel struck near the Syrian capital of Damascus earlier this month. Israeli officials said at the time they were targeting suspected shipments of advanced missiles purportedly intended for Hezbollah.

&gt;Asked whether Syria would respond to such strikes, Assad said: ""We have told countries that we will respond to any strike with a similar strike."" He says that the manner of the response ""depends on the circumstance and timing"" of the attack.

&gt;He also says he agrees 'in principle' to send negotiators to peace talks

&gt;""There is a pressure by the people to open a new front in the Golan,"" Syrian President Bashar Assad said in an interview broadcast on Thursday.

&gt;In an interview with Al-Manar TV station, Assad added: ""Even amongst the Arab world there is a clear readiness to join the fight against Israel.""

&gt;Speaking on a possible response to the recent cross-border firing between Syrian troops and the IDF, Assad stated: ""If we want to respond to Israel, the response must be strategic,"" adding that it is difficult to say what the military action would be, as it would be up to the military leadership.

&gt;""But we have several possibilities,"" Assad suggested.

&gt;Regarding the recent reports over a delivery of S-300 missiles from Moscow, Assad said Russia remained committed to military deals signed with Damascus before the outbreak of conflict in the country.

&gt;In a text of the interview on the Al-Manar TV website, Assad said that Russia is ""committed to the deal and neither [Prime Minister Binyamin] Netanyahu's visit nor the current crisis will influence the importing of arms.""

&gt;Asked by Lebanon's Al-Manar television about delivery of Russian S-300 air defense missiles, Assad said: ""The contracts with Russia are not linked to the crisis and Russia is committed to implementing these contracts.""""Everything we have agreed on with Russia will take place, and part of it has already taken place,"" he said.

*Update on earlier report:*

&gt;Turkish authorities have arrested a group of Syria's al-Qaida-linked al-Nusra Front militants who allegedly had been planning an attack inside Turkey and were in possession of the nerve agent sarin, local media reported on Thursday.

&gt;While they could not be immediately confirmed, the reports highlight the growing concerns that Syria's civil war is dragging in neighboring states.

&gt;In the worst example of the spillover into Turkey, 52 people were killed when twin car bombs ripped through the border town of Reyhanli on May 11. Turkey has accused Syria of involvement in the attacks, but Damascus has denied any role.

&gt;“We don't support any single person, we support Syria as a nation,” said an SEA representative to GlobalPost on Wednesday. ""We are not pro-Assad, we are pro-Syria.”

&gt;As Salafist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra continue to edge out the country’s more moderate Free Syrian Army, the SEA fears an Islamist takeover of the religiously diverse country at the hands of foreign fighters funded by foreign donors. The SEA’s primary objective is to bring that perspective of the war to western audiences.

&gt;Secretary of State John Kerry said Thursday the transfer of advanced missile defense systems from Russia to Syria would be a ""destabilizing"" factor for Israel's security.

&gt;Kerry said the U.S. has expressed concerns about what such defensive systems in Syria would mean for Israel's security. He wouldn't address what the missiles might mean for Syria's civil war.

&gt;He spoke to reporters in Rome after the Wall Street Journal reported that Russia was preparing to sell the weapons to President Bashar Assad's regime.

&gt;Coming just days after Kerry hailed what he described as a U.S.-Russia breakthrough on Syria, the report suggested Moscow may already be angling to further strengthen the Assad regime two years into a war that has killed more than 70,000 people.

&gt;""We have previously stated that the missiles,"" Kerry said, ""are potentially destabilizing with respect to the state of Israel.""

&gt;""We have made it crystal clear that we prefer that Russia would not supply them assistance,"" Kerry told reporters alongside new Italian Foreign Minister Emma Bonino. ""That is on record. That hasn't changed.""

&gt;Turkey's prime minister is charging that the Syrian government has used chemical weapons against its people and has called on the U.S. to take stronger action, he told NBC News' Ann Curry in an exclusive interview Thursday.

&gt;""It is clear the regime has used chemical weapons and missiles,"" Turkish premier Recep Tayyip Erdogan said.

&gt;Erdogan gave no specifics about when and where the weapons were allegedly used, but he said he believes President Obama's ""red line"" for the U.S. in deciding whether to take action has been crossed.

&gt;""It has been passed long time ago,"" said Erdogan, who is meeting with Obama on May 16.

&gt;""We want the United States to assume more responsibilities and take further steps. And what sort of steps they will take, we are going to talk about this.""

&gt;Erdogan cited as evidence the ""remainders of missiles"" — at least 200 by his count — that he believes were used in chemical attacks, along with the injuries of Syrians brought over the Turkish border for medical treatment.

&gt;""There are patients who are brought to our hospitals who were wounded by these chemical weapons,"" he said.

&gt;A top U.S. military commander on Thursday warned that Syria would descend into a spiral of sectarian violence that would likely tear the country apart if President Bashar al-Assad fell from power.

&gt;""I would not be surprised to see Syria break apart entirely,"" said Adm. James Stavridis, NATO Supreme Allied Commander, Europe and head of U.S. European Command, about the country’s post-Assad future in an interview with The Atlantic.

&gt;“When people say, ‘what does Syria look like the day after Assad?’ That's the wrong question. It's not what it will look like the day after; it's what will Syria look like a decade after,” Stavridis added.

&gt;Stavridis’s comments come as the White House weighs action against Syria’s leaders after reports of chemical weapons use and with the Pentagon and U.S. agencies already preparing transition plans for a post-Assad Syria.

&gt;The UN-Arab League mediator in the Syria conflict, Lakhdar Brahimi, has agreed to stay on despite his frustration at the international deadlock that has prevented UN action to halt the two-year-old civil war, the United Nations said on Thursday.

&gt;A dispute over Syria between Russia, which supports and provides weapons to the government of President Bashar Assad, and the United States, which says Assad must go and backs the rebels, has left the UN Security Council paralyzed.

&gt;But in recent days Russia and the United States agreed to seek new peace talks that would bring together Assad's government and the rebels in an attempt to push for a diplomatic resolution of Syria's civil war.

&gt;It is a move the United Nations praised as long overdue.

&gt;Fierce clashes between rebels and fighters loyal to President Bashar al-Assad have raged  around insurgent-held Qusayr in central Syria, a monitoring group has said.

&gt;An army officer told AFP the military seized control of Shumariyeh village near the town of Qusayr.

&gt;""The Syrian army seized back control of Shumariyeh in the Qusayr countryside, and troops are currently on their way to the village of Ghassaniyeh"" which has been under rebel control for more than a year, the officer said.

&gt;The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights confirmed the report.

&gt;""Backed by pro-regime militia and Hezbollah fighters, the army is advancing in the Qusayr area,"" Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP.

&gt;""They have superior firepower and their campaign to take back Qusayr is fierce."" 

&gt;The town is strategically located near the Lebanese border and just south of Syria's third city, Homs, which lies on the road linking Damascus to the coast.

&gt;Weeks after radical Lebanese Sunni sheikhs called on men from the country to join Syrian rebels fighting Assad and Hezbollah, two Lebanese fighters from the northern city of Tripoli were killed in Qusayr, a Lebanese security source said.

&gt;On Thursday, three shells hit Hermel in eastern Lebanon, and two others hit Masharia al-Qaa nearby, a security source told AFP.

&gt;Fighting also raged in flashpoints across Syria, among them Barzeh in northern Damascus, said the Observatory, which relies on a broad network of activists, doctors and lawyers for its reports.

&gt;Southwest of Damascus, the air force bombarded rebel positions located between rebel strongholds Daraya and Moadamiyet al-Sham, which the regime has been fighting to reclaim since last year.

&gt;In Damascus, a shell hit the Zablatani district in the heart of the city, while three others landed in the Qasaa area nearby, causing material damage, said the Observatory.

&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey would support a US-enforced no-fly zone in Syria and warned that Damascus crossed President Barack Obama's ""red line"" on chemical weapons use long ago, according to an NBC News interview released Thursday.

&gt;A no-fly zone to prohibit Syrian military aircraft from hitting rebel targets has been mentioned by American lawmakers as one option the United States could use to put pressure on Syrian President Bashar Assad.

&gt;""Right from the beginning ... we would say 'Yes,"" Erdogan said when asked if Turkey, a NATO member that shares its longest border with Syria, would support such action, according to an NBC.com report.

&gt;But setting up a no-fly zone would require US air strikes, and possibly forces sent into Syria, at the risk of casualties. There is little chance the United States would undertake that anytime soon, US security officials say.

&gt;Turkey launches a military operation at NATO air base 60 miles from the Syrian border during time of heightened tension; the exercise will test readiness for battle and coordination with government ministries.

&gt;The Turkish military launched a 10-day exercise at a base near the border with Syria on Monday, where fears of a spillover of violence and of the fallout of any chemical weapons use have escalated in recent weeks.

&gt;The exercise at Incirlik, a NATO air base outside the city of Adana where U.S. troops are also stationed, will test the military's readiness for battle and coordination with government ministries, the general staff said in a statement.

&gt; ""(The exercise will) test joint operations that would be carried out between ministries, public institutions and the armed forces at a time of mobilization and war,"" it said.

&gt;While the exercise in Adana province, some 100 km (60 miles) from the border, was described by NATO's second-biggest military as ""planned"", it comes at a time of heightened tension.

&gt;Israel's weekend airstrike on a military complex near the Syrian capital of Damascus killed at least 42 Syrian soldiers, a group of anti-regime activists said Monday, citing information from military hospitals.

&gt;The Syrian government has not released a death toll, but Syrian state media have reported casualties in Sunday's pre-dawn airstrike, Israel's third into Syria so far this year.

&gt;Testimony from victims of the conflict in Syria suggests rebels have used the nerve agent, sarin, a leading member of a UN commission of inquiry has said.

&gt;Carla Del Ponte told Swiss TV that there were ""strong, concrete suspicions but not yet incontrovertible proof"".

&gt;Ms Del Ponte did not rule out the possibility that government forces might also have used chemical weapons.

&gt;Later, the commission stressed that it had ""not reached conclusive findings"" as to their use by any parties.

&gt;The Iranian recruitment call appears mainly on a site belonging to supporters of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, according to the Iran-Israel Observer, which is run by Israeli Iranian commentator Meir Javedanfar. Would-be volunteers are asked to call an Iranian number or send a text message. The Iranian site also bears the logo of Hezbollah, which recently said it was “ready to prevent Syria from falling into Tel Aviv and Washington’s hands.”

[11:36 PM CST]/[5:36 AM GMT]
&gt;BEIRUT — Huge explosions were reported in Damascus early Sunday, just two days after a reported Israeli airstrike in Syria targeting surface-to-air missiles possibly destined for neighboring Lebanon and the militant group Hezbollah.

&gt;Syrian state media also blamed Israel for Sunday's predawn onslaught, saying that Israeli jet fighters had launched rockets on the capital.

The site targeted was a military research facility in Jamraya, just outside Damascus, state media reported. That was the same complex targeted Jan. 30, when Israel launched its first known airstrike into Syria since the onset of that nation's civil war.

&gt;Unverified video released early Sunday showed balls of fire soaring into the night sky. Witness accounts from Damascus indicated there was a thunderous explosion about 2 a.m., heard throughout the city, that was followed by smaller explosions.

&gt;There were no immediate reports of casualties from the reported blasts, and no immediate comment from Israel or the United States.

&gt;The Western intelligence source said Israel carried out the attack and the operation hit Iranian-supplied missiles which were en route to Hezbollah.

&gt; Israel launched an airstrike in the Syrian capital Sunday targeting a shipment of extremely accurate guided Iranian-made missiles believed to be on their way to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group, an intelligence official in the Middle East said.

&gt;The attack, the second in three days, signaled a sharp escalation of Israel's involvement in Syria's bloody civil war.

&gt;The confirmation came hours after Syria's state media reported that Israeli missiles struck a research center near the Syrian capital, setting off explosions and causing casualties.

&gt;The official told The Associated Press that, as with Friday's strike, the target was Fatah 110 missiles, which have very precise guidance systems with better aim than anything Hezbollah has in its arsenal.
The official spoke on condition of anonymity in order to disclose information about a secret military operation to the media.

&gt;He said the raid near Qasioun targeted a military position for the elite Republican Guards that is in charge of protecting Damascus, President Bashar Assad's seat of power.
Mohammed Saeed, another activist who lives in the Damascus suburb of Douma, said ""the explosions were so strong that earth shook under us."" He said the smell of the fire caused by the air raid near Qasioun could be felt miles away.

&gt;The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an activist group, also reported large explosions in the area of Jamraya, a military and scientific research facility northwest of Damascus, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from the Lebanese border.

&gt;Hezbollah's al-Manar TV said the research center in Jamraya was not hit. It added that an army supply center was targeted by the strike.

&gt;Al-Manar quoted unnamed Syrian security officials as saying that three sites including military barracks, arms depots and air defense center were targeted by the strike.

&gt;Lebanon's Al-Mayadeen TV, that has several reporters around Syria, said one of the strikes targeted a military position in the village of Saboura, west of Damascus and about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the Lebanon border.

&gt;NEW ORLEANS -- NOPD Superintendent Ronal Serpas says that at least 12 people were shot at a Mother's Day second-line parade in the 7th Ward.

&gt;The youngest victim in the shooting was 10 years old.
Police say there were 200 people at the corner where shots rang out, and 300 to 400 people at the second line in all.
EMS took nine people to University Hospital; eight were suffering from gunshot wounds, while another was injured in a fall while escaping the shooting. Three of those victims who were shot are in critical condition.

&gt;There were about 10 cops on the scene trying to control the second line when the shooting happened. There were reportedly two different guns involved.
Police believe three suspects were involved. They were seen fleeing toward Claiborne Avenue.
We have a reporter at the scene and will have the latest during the 5:30 p.m. newscast

&gt;The victims include a 10-year-old who sustained a minor wound. At least four people were in surgery mid-afternoon and patients had been taken to four area hospitals.

&gt;No suspects were in custody and it was not clear what motivated the shooter or shooters. Police are looking for three people in connection with the attack.

&gt;""Shots just started ringing out and everyone started running,"" one eyewitness told WDSU's Rachel Wulff. ""Next thing I hear, 10, 15 people got shot.""

&gt;The incident happened shortly before 2 p.m. in the 7th Ward.

&gt;Syria’s main opposition National Coalition on Wednesday said any political settlement to the country’s two-year-old conflict must start with President Bashar al-Assad’s ouster, implicitly rejecting a U.S.-Russian initiative for dialogue with the regime.
U.N.-Arab League peace envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, meanwhile, hailed the agreement between Washington and Moscow to push both sides in the Syrian conflict to end the bloodshed and sit down for talks.

&gt;“The National Coalition welcomes all international efforts which call for a political solution to achieve the aspirations of the Syrian people and their hope for a democratic state, so long as they begin with the departure of Bashar al-Assad and his regime,” the opposition umbrella group said.

&gt;The response could be a blow to the U.S.-Russian initiative, which is based on an international deal agreed in Geneva last year that makes no mention of Assad stepping down.

&gt;The White House says that Syria's future cannot include President Bashar Assad.

&gt;White House spokesman Jay Carney said on Wednesday that the US viewed Syria's future as being a post-Assad future.

&gt;But he said it was up to the Syrian opposition to decide which elements of Assad's regime could be included in a transitional government.

&gt;Carney was asked to clarify the US position a day after Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States and Russia would convene a conference soon to seek peace talks between the Syrian government and the opposition.

&gt;Obama has long said Assad must leave office, but Kerry said Tuesday it was up to the Syrian people whether he should leave.

&gt;Iran has condemned what it calls a Syrian rebel attack on a shrine where remains of a 7th-century figure revered by Shias were dug up and taken away.

&gt;Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi's comments, quoted by Iranian Press TV, came in the wake of a report of the desecration of the Hojr Ibn Oday shrine near Damascus, posted with photographs on Facebook in late April, highlighted how Syria's civil war was inflaming sectarian anger.

&gt;The report could not be verified but it prompted the Shia leadership in Tehran to urge respect for holy sites in a conflict where the rebels include Sunni Islamists hostile to Iran.

&gt;Salehi urged international organisations to safeguard sacred Islamic and Christian places in Syria, an ancient crossroads for religions.

&gt;There have been increasing reports of some of Syria's many Shia shrines being desecrated as Sunni rebels gained ground since late last year, but these were difficult to verify, given restrictions on independent media access to the country. - Reuters

&gt;The United States is to donate another $100 million (76 million euros) in humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees boosting its total to $510 million, the State Department said Wednesday.

&gt;The additional funds, to be officially announced Thursday by Secretary of State John Kerry, will fund U.N. programmes for shelter, food and help to refugees in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey as well as inside Syria, it said in a statement.

&gt;Washington has also given $250 million in non-lethal assistance to the Syrian rebels fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad, and it is by far the largest single donor to the Syrian people caught in the bloody conflict.

A Reuters article about what American intervention would potentially look like, worth reading in full:


&gt;While the effectiveness of Syria's aging air force is unclear, most experts believe its air-defense missile system, considerably upgraded after a 2007 Israeli strike on a suspected nuclear site, remains more potent than any the United States has faced since it bombed Serbian forces in 1999.

&gt;""These recent events have not changed our assessment of the sophistication of the Syrian air defense system,"" said a senior U.S. official.

&gt;That said, the United States does indeed have the power to wipe out Syria's air defenses.


&gt;Before the Syrian civil war began, Western analysts estimated that Assad had around 25 air-defense brigades with some 150 surface-to-air missile launchers.

&gt;The first U.S. official noted that Syrian air defenses have been strengthened in recent years. Still, the extent to which its civil war may have degraded those defenses is unclear.

&gt;Many of Syria's anti-aircraft missiles are mobile, which means Assad's forces could choose to locate them near schools or apartment buildings, hoping U.S. forces might avoid targeting them for fear of causing civilian casualties. The density of the defenses raises the risk of civilian deaths.

&gt;According to one Western defense planner, taking down the entire Syrian system would involve a heavy opening salvo of cruise missiles and then air strikes. The Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank estimates that such an assault would take the combined combat power of at least two U.S. aircraft carriers, although U.S. and allied aircraft could also be based at nearby land bases in Turkey, Jordan and Cyprus.

&gt;The United Nations has pulled peacekeepers back from an observation post in the Golan Heights ceasefire zone where four Philippine troops were abducted by Syrian rebels, a spokesman has said.

&gt;The move on Wednesday came as countries which contribute troops to the UN Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) expressed renewed concern about security in the zone 
between Israel and war-stricken Syria.

&gt;The Philippines called on the UN Security Council to ""exert all influence"" to obtain the release of the Filipino troops.

&gt;The four were seized by Syrian rebels on Tuesday, only two months after 21 Filipino soldiers were abducted by the same group for four days.

&gt;The e Filipino troops were at an observation post in the Al Jamlah zone of the Golan Heights. Syrian activists said fighting has continued in the zone.

&gt;Syria's main armed opposition group, the Free Syrian Army (FSA), is losing fighters and capabilities to Jabhat al-Nusra, an Islamist organisation with links to al-Qaida that is emerging as the best-equipped, financed and motivated force fighting Bashar al-Assad's regime.

&gt;Evidence of the growing strength of al-Nusra, gathered from Guardian interviews with FSA commanders across Syria, underlines the dilemma for the US, Britain and other governments as they ponder the question of arming anti-Assad rebels.

&gt;Illustrating their plight, FSA commanders say that entire units have gone over to al-Nusra while others have lost a quarter or more of their strength to them recently.

&gt;""Fighters feel proud to join al-Nusra because that means power and influence,"" said Abu Ahmed, a former teacher from Deir Hafer who now commands an FSA brigade in the countryside near Aleppo. ""Al-Nusra fighters rarely withdraw for shortage of ammunition or fighters and they leave their target only after liberating it,"" he added. ""They compete to carry out martyrdom [suicide] operations.""

&gt;Saudi Arabia on Monday called for U.N. action to end Israeli strikes on Syria, describing the raids as a “dangerous violation” of the sovereignty of an Arab state, the official SPA news agency reported.

&gt;The Saudi cabinet voiced “deep concern from the worsening situation in Syria” and urged “swift action by the U.N. Security Council to stop these Israeli attacks on Syrian territories and ensure they are not repeated,” said SPA.

&gt;The kingdom has repeatedly voiced support to rebels in Syria battling President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and severed diplomatic ties with Damascus since 2011.

&gt;But its government on Monday described Israel’s raids as “flagrant attacks and a dangerous violation of the sovereignty of an Arab state, warning of its dangerous effects in the region's security and stability.”

&gt;Shi'ite Muslim Iran is Assad's closest ally and has provided money, weapons, intelligence and training for his forces against a mainly Sunni Muslim uprising in which more than 70,000 people have been killed in two years, by a UN estimate.

&gt;""God forbid, if there is any vacuum in Syria, these negative consequences will affect all countries ... No one knows what will happen,"" Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi told reporters during a rare visit to Jordan.

&gt;Western officials and experts fear that a pair of Israeli airstrikes on Syrian military targets in recent days increased the risk of attacks on Israeli tourists and other civilian targets in the coming weeks as Damascus and its allies try to retaliate.

&gt;On Tuesday, Syrian officials repeated warnings that “Israel will suffer” for destroying a cache of advanced Iranian-built missiles apparently intended for Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group closely allied with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

&gt;U.S. and Middle Eastern officials say any retaliation would likely come in a familiar form: attempted attacks by Hezbollah operatives against Israeli or Jewish civilian targets, perhaps far outside the Middle East.

&gt;Republican Sen. John McCain has revived calls for a no-fly zone. And introducing legislation to arm the Syrian rebels in the U.S. Senate on Monday, Democratic Sen. Robert Menendez said: ""There will be no greater strategic setback to Iran than to have the Assad regime collapse, and cause a disruption to the terror pipeline between Tehran and Hezbollah in Lebanon.""

&gt;But more than two years since the revolt against al-Assad began, regional analysts say Syria is in danger of becoming the next Somalia, which collapsed into fiefdoms 20 years ago and has been stalked by anarchy, terrorism and hunger ever since. Except Syria would be worse. Its religious and ethnic fault lines extend across borders in every direction; Somalia's anarchy was largely self-contained. Somalia never had chemical weapons, nor the missiles and modern armor that make Syria one of the most crowded arsenals in the world.


&gt;As veteran Middle East watcher Anthony H. Cordesman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies has put it: ""The Assad regime seems ready to escalate in any way it can to either preserve power or effectively divide the country.""

&gt;A U.S. State Department official on Monday would say only: ""We take any reports of use of chemical weapons very seriously and we are trying to get as many facts as possible to understand what is happening.""

&gt;But understanding and countering the threat are miles apart. The Pentagon estimated last year it might take 70,000 troops to secure or destroy Syria's massive stockpiles -- and the situation on the ground has deteriorated since then.

&gt;In a confidential paper, seen by The Daily Telegraph, diplomats set out two ""options"" allowing Britain and France to start supplying arms to the official Syrian opposition by amending the embargo when it comes up for renewal at the end of the month.

&gt;""The situation in Syria is deteriorating sharply. With the likely use of chemical weapons and the growth of extremism, the conflict has entered an even more dangerous phase,"" the paper argues. ""We must consider all the options, [including] the ability to give further assistance to the moderate Syrian opposition. It will also protect civilians, and save lives. Crucially, it will ensure we can respond flexibly to a major escalation in the conflict, such as chemical weapons attacks.""

&gt;The proposal will be discussed by foreign ministers at a meeting in Brussels on 27 May where it will run into opposition led by Germany which also has the backing of Baroness Ashton and her EU diplomatic service.

&gt;British diplomats however stressed that while Britain wants the embargo lifted, Whitehall has taken not made a decision to arm the rebels in London.

&gt;The proposal also suggested ""safeguards"" must be set out to ensure the Syrian National Coalition keeps control of military aid.

&gt;British officials want the EU to either ""fully exempt the National Coalition from the arms embargo"" or ""remove 'non-lethal' language to allow lethal equipment to be supplied to the Coalition"".

&gt;The message also said that Tehran recognizes that the real target behind Israel's alleged attacks on Syrian soil were Iran and Hezbollah.

&gt;The paper quotes Iranian sources as saying the response to Israel's alleged strikes will be made on two levels. The first being “blows under the belt in several locations,” which could be done inside Syria under the policy of ""contain, squeeze and crush,"" or outside of it, while maintaining the ""terror balance.""

&gt;The second possible way of response will be calling a meeting of ""the friends of the Syrian people"" in Tehran in two weeks, in which Iran will ""announce a new initiative for a Syrian solution."" More than 40 countries will be invited, and President Assad will be represented by ministers Ali Haidar and Qadri Jamil.

&gt;The Iranian sources also told Al-Akhbar Israel's ""aggression against Syria"" was a part of “an attempt to enter Damascus and cause mayhem before the meeting between US Secretary of State John Kerry and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow,"" but that ""the attempted coup was aborted.”

&gt;Turkey is stepping up chemical weapons tests on casualties arriving from Syria's civil war to help ensure the perpetrators of any such attacks are held accountable, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Thursday.

&gt;The United States has said it views any use of chemical weapons in Syria as a ""red line"", hinting this could lead to some form of foreign intervention. But chastened by the false intelligence that was used to justify the 2003 war in Iraq, Washington says it wants proof before taking any action.

&gt;Turkey confirmed last week that it had begun testing blood samples taken from Syrian casualties brought over the border for treatment to determine whether they were victims of a chemical weapons attack.

&gt;Hezbollah chief Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah said Thursday that Syria would supply his organization with 'game-changing weapons' in response to recent air raids near Damascus, which foreign news sources said were carried out by the Israel Air Force.

&gt;According to the Daily Star, Nasrallah said Israel sought to achieve two objectives through the strikes: neutralize Syria in terms of the Israeli-Arab conflict, and prevent Hezbollah from building up its arsenal.

&gt;In response to alleged Israeli strikes, Nasrallah added, Damascus would provide the Lebanese resistance group with sophisticated weapons that it has not received in the past. He also said Hezbollah would support any group seeking to target Israel in the occupied Golan Heights.

&gt;The Hezbollah leader emphasized that his forces would support any Syrian effort to recapture the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.

&gt;""We announce that we stand with the Syrian popular resistance and offer material and spiritual support as well as coordination in order to liberate the Syrian Golan,"" he said in a televised speech.

&gt;Syria is ready to receive a UN team to investigate claims of the use of chemical weapons in the country's conflict, Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Muqdad told AFP on Thursday.

&gt;""We were ready and we are always ready, right now, to receive the delegation that was set up by (UN chief) Ban Ki-moon to investigate what happened in Khan al-Assal,"" Muqdad said.

&gt;Syria first asked for the inquiry shortly after accusing opposition rebels of using chemical weapons at Khan al-Assal near Aleppo on March 23 in an attack in which authorities say more than 30 people died.

&gt;Syria is under mounting international pressure over the possible use of banned arms. The United States said in April it believed the Syrian government has used chemical weapons but was awaiting definitive proof.

&gt;“We don't support any single person, we support Syria as a nation,” said an SEA representative to GlobalPost on Wednesday. ""We are not pro-Assad, we are pro-Syria.”

&gt;As Salafist groups like Jabhat al-Nusra continue to edge out the country’s more moderate Free Syrian Army, the SEA fears an Islamist takeover of the religiously diverse country at the hands of foreign fighters funded by foreign donors. The SEA’s primary objective is to bring that perspective of the war to western audiences.

The dry ice appeared to have been placed in a plastic bottle that was left in a trash can. The explosion was confined to the can, according to the Anaheim Police Department.

The device appeared similar to other devices that have exploded in Anaheim neighborhoods in recent months, Sgt. Bob Dunn said.

“Unfortunately,” Dunn told The Times,  “it’s an all too-common occurrence.”

He said police were investigating whether there was any connection between those explosions and the blast at Toontown.

Investigators Tuesday night had not established a motive or determined why Toontown was targeted.

Dunn said investigators planned to review video surveillance footage and examining Internet postings and social media to find out who was responsible for placing the device in the trash can.

A 22-year-old Disneyland employee has been arrested in connection with the detonation of a so-called dry ice bomb in the park's Toontown, Anaheim police said Wednesday.

Long Beach resident Christian Barnes, an outdoor vending ""cast member,"" was booked on suspicion of possession of a destructive device and is being held in lieu of bail of $1 million.

""Barnes is cooperating with investigators and has indicated this is an isolated incident with unanticipated impacts,"" Anaheim police Sgt. Bob Dunn said.

Police described Barnes as a vendor who peddled sodas and water on a mobile cart. They did not give a motive for the incident, which did not cause any significant damage.

It does not appear to be connected to similar dry-ice explosions in Anaheim in recent months, Dunn said.

&gt;Former al-Muhajiroun head Anjem Choudary told The Associated Press that the man in startling video footage that emerged after the killing as Michael Adebolajo, a Christian who converted to Islam around 2003 and took part in several of the group's demonstrations in London.

&gt;Omar Bakri Muhammad — who now lives in Lebanon but had been a radical Muslim preacher in London — also said he recognized the man seen on television as Adebolajo and said he attended his London lectures in the early 2000s. Police have not named Adebolajo.

&gt;Bakri said he remembers Adebolajo as a ""shy person"" who was keen to learn about Islam and asked interesting questions.
""He used to listen more than he spoke,"" Bakri said. ""I was very surprised to learn that he is the suspect in the attack.""

&gt;A second person hospitalized following the attack has not yet been identified.

&gt;The two men suspected of butchering the British soldier had been part of previous investigations by security services, a British official said Thursday, as investigators searched several locations and tried to determine whether the men were part of a wider plot to instill terror on the streets of London.

&gt;One of the two men suspected of hacking to death soldier Lee Rigby in Woolwich was well-known locally as an Islamist activist.

&gt;Michael Adeboloja apparently handed out leaflets promoting radical Islamic ideas in Woolwich High Street.

&gt;People who claimed they know him also said he sometimes ran a stall from which he gave out leaflets condemning the UK government over the involvement of British troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.

&gt;Sky's crime correspondent Martin Brunt said: ""If that is the case, then it suggests that he is somebody who should at least should have come to the attention of local police.

&gt;""There is this whole government strategy which is supposed to pick up people like him.""

&gt;One schoolfriend said he rememebered him as a ""nice guy"", and said he was shocked when he discovered that he was implicated in the attack.

&gt;Simon Collings, 25, from Romford said: ""He was just a nice guy really, he didn't do anything bad to anyone, he wasn't a bully or anything.

&gt;""If anything, I would have expected him to go the hip-hop route than the Muslim route. Just your standard East London kid.""

**[New footage of the terrorists attempting to ambush police officers responding to the attack](http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/woolwich-attack-watch-shocking-video-1907772)**

&gt;This is the moment two terrorists who butchered soldier Lee Rigby also tried to kill a hero woman cop who was first on the scene of the carnage.           

&gt;Shocking footage obtained by the Daily Mirror shows how the calculating pair lured officers to the scene by dragging the body into the middle of the road and brazenly waiting for armed police to arrive.

&gt;When the first police car arrived the pair split up in a pre-planned manoeuvre with knife-wielding Michael Adebolajo charging them head-on, while his accomplice ran up alongside, aiming his revolver at them.

&gt;The film of the 10 seconds of terror show how Adebolajo got within TWO FEET of the terrified female cop who was driving the armed response vehicle.

&gt;She was armed with just a Taser as she sat in the driver’s seat of the BMW X5 and was only saved when a male colleague sitting in the back made a split-second decision to fire his machine-gun from point blank range through the window.

&gt;As he is sent sprawling to the ground by the force of the two shots and the two cops jump out to cover him they appear to fail to spot the other suspect aiming his hand gun at them.

&gt;Luckily a third SO19 marksman running round from the far side of the specialist Trojan unit spots him and he is brought to the ground as a further volley of six shots ring out in the suburban street in Woolwich, south east London.

**[The Guardian]**

&gt;The two suspects in the butchering to death of a British soldier had been known to the domestic security service MI5 and the police over an eight-year period, but had been assessed as peripheral figures and thus not subjected to a full-scale investigation, it has emerged .

&gt;Adebolajo, from a Nigerian churchgoing family who later converted to Islam, had complained of harassment by MI5 in the last three years after he came to the intelligence agency's attention.

&gt;The suspects, shot by police shortly after the incident, remain in separate but unidentified hospitals, too badly injured to be questioned.

&gt;Detectives investigating Rigby's death also arrested a 29-year-old man and woman on suspicion of conspiracy to murder the soldier, suggesting there may have been a wider conspiracy to carry out the attack. The 29-year-old woman was arrested at a flat in Greenwich, south-east London.

&gt;""If Syrian President Assad reacts by attacking Israel…he will risk forfeiting his regime,"" a senior Israeli official told the New York Times on Wednesday.

&gt;The Times' White House correspondent Mark Landler wrote that the official contacted the newspaper on his own initiative.

&gt;Landler added that the official had been briefed in the last two days by other senior Israeli officials, who have intimate knowledge of the recent developments in Syria. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic.

&gt;The official added that Israel is considering further strikes in Syria in order to prevent the transfer of advanced weapons into Hezbollah's hands.

&gt;""The transfer of such weapons to Hezbollah will destabilize and endanger the entire region,” the official said. ""If Syrian President Assad reacts by attacking Israel, or tries to strike Israel through his terrorist proxies, he will risk forfeiting his regime, for Israel will retaliate.""

&gt;“Israel has so far refrained from intervening in Syria’s civil war and will maintain this policy as long as Assad refrains from attacking Israel directly or indirectly,” the official added.

&gt;A senior Israeli official noted that the decision to contact the New York Times was made at the highest levels of Israeli government. According to him, the objective was to make Israel's position regarding the smuggling of weapons from Syria to Hezbollah clear to Syria and the international community, as well as the dire consequences that a Syrian attack on Israel would have on the chances of survival of Assad's regime. The Prime Minister's Office refused to deny or confirm that they were behind the story in the New York Times.

&gt;Four suspects were arrested in Turkey late on Wednesday in connection with car bombings that killed 51 people in a town near the Syrian border at the weekend, state-run Anatolian news agency reported.

&gt;The two bomb blasts in Reyhanli fanned fears that Syria's civil war is dragging in neighbouring states. Damascus has denied Turkish allegations it was involved in the blasts.

&gt;Turkish prosecutors sent eight suspects to a court in the southern city of Adana after questioning and the court released four, remanding the other four in custody, the agency said.

&gt;It was not clear what charges they were facing.

&gt;A total of 17 people have been detained in connection with the attacks and police were continuing to question the remaining suspects.

&gt;Small amounts of chemical weapons have been used at least twice in Syria, but Washington is seeking more information as it mulls its response, a top U.S. official said Wednesday.

&gt;“The intelligence community has agreed with varying levels of confidence that chemical weapons were used in small amounts in at least two instances in Syria,” Under Secretary of State Wendy Sherman told U.S. lawmakers.

&gt;“But having high confidence up in the intelligence community, for which I have great admiration, is not in fact all that one needs to take some of the actions that many people have contemplated.”

&gt;Sherman did not say which side was believed to have used the weapons in the bloody conflict in Syria now in its third year, in which rebels are seeking to oust President Bashar al-Assad.

&gt;But she told the House foreign affairs committee that U.S. President Barack Obama -- who has said the use of chemical weapons would be a red line for the international community -- was right to proceed cautiously.

&gt;“We have unfortunate experience in our history, where we've taken action and it turned out that the intelligence assessment was either misinterpreted or not accurate,” Sherman said.

&gt;The US government on Thursday blacklisted four Syrian government ministers, an airline and a television station it said helped the Assad government in its two-year crackdown on opposition forces.

&gt;The move follows broad US sanctions on any aid to Syria since the beginning of the civil war between President Bashar al-Assad's government and opposition groups that has killed an estimated 80,000 people.

&gt;The US Treasury Department said the government-owned airline, Syrian Arab Airlines, helped Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards ship illegal cargo - including rockets, anti-aircraft guns and ammunition - to aid the Syrian government.

&gt;The United States also accused the privately held Al-Dunya Television of assisting Assad's propaganda by airing forced confessions. Al-Dunya also helped the government disseminate fake weapons busts and arrest people it had interviewed, according to Treasury.

&gt;Treasury also blacklisted, or designated, four Syrian officials: the ministers of defense, health, industry, and justice, as part of its broader steps to stymie the government's activities. The defense minister, Fahed Jaseem al-Freij, has been in charge of Syria's armed forces during air strikes and executions of civilians, according to the U.S. government.

&gt;Syria's foreign minister says President Bashar al-Assad's government has agreed ""in principle"" to take part in peace talks in Geneva planned for June.

&gt;Walid Muallem told reporters in Baghdad that the conference was ""a good opportunity for a political solution to the crisis in Syria"".

&gt;Russia and the US hope the talks will bring a negotiated end to the violence.

&gt;Syria's main opposition coalition has said it is willing to take part if President Bashar al-Assad steps down.

&gt;A spokesman for the National Coalition, Louay Safi, told the BBC on Friday that the government would have to agree to a framework that involved a handover of power by President Assad ""and his associates"" as part of a settlement.

&gt;No date for the conference has yet been finalised, and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State John Kerry are due to discuss the planned talks in Paris on Monday with French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius.

&gt;The comments represent a departure from the traditional Arab view of Hezbollah as a main force against Israel and show the widening sectarian divisions in the region over the war in Syria.

&gt;""Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sheikh Khaled bin Ahmed al-Khalifa, said that Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah is a terrorist and is declaring war on his own nation,"" the Bahrian News Agency reported, quoting the minister's twitter account.

&gt;""Stopping (Nasrallah) and saving Lebanon from him is a national and religious duty,"" he added, according to BNA.

&gt;Two rockets hit a Shi'ite Muslim district of Beirut on Sunday, driving home the risk of spillover from Syria's civil war, after the head of Lebanese Shi'ite militant Hezbollah said it would keep fighting on the Syrian government's side until victory.

&gt;It was the first attack to apparently target Hezbollah's stronghold in the south of the Lebanese capital since the outbreak of the two-year conflict in neighboring Syria, which has sharply heightened Lebanon's own sectarian tensions.

&gt;Jordan, which shares borders with war-torn Syria, said on Sunday it is in talks with “friendly countries” to deploy Patriot missiles on its territory after a similar move by Turkey.

&gt;“Jordan wishes to deploy Patriot missile batteries in order to boost its defense capabilities and help protect the country,” Information Minister Mohammad Momani told a news conference.

&gt;“We are currently at the stage of talks with friendly states,” said Momani, who is also government spokesman, declining to elaborate.

&gt;A NATO source told AFP last week that four batteries of Patriot missiles have arrived in Turkey as part of a mission by the alliance to protect the Turkish border from any spillover of the conflict in neighboring Syria.

&gt;NATO approved their deployment in December, saying the use of ballistic missiles by the Syrian regime posed a threat to Turkey.

&gt;Jordan, home to more than 500,000 Syrian refugees, has similar concerns as Turkey.

&gt;“We wish and we demand Patriot missiles. We always talk about this because we want to protect ourselves,” Jordan’s Prime Minister Abdullah Nsur told Qatar’s Al-Sharq newspaper last week.

&gt;In April, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel revealed that some 150 U.S. military specialists have been deployed in Jordan since last year and that he had ordered a U.S. Army headquarters team to bolster the mission, bringing the total American presence to more than 200 troops.

&gt;Eleven rebels have been killed in clashes in northern Syria with Kurdish rebels of the main Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD), the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Sunday.

&gt;""Fighting last night (Saturday) in the Afrin region between PYD armed wing the People's Protection Committees (YPG) and rebels left 11 dead and 20 wounded"" among rebel forces, the Britain-based watchdog said.

&gt;It also reported clashes in the same area of Aleppo province several days previously at a checkpoint installed by rebel forces south of the town of Kubani, without saying whether there were any casualties.

&gt;Since the beginning of Syria's uprising more than two years ago, the Kurds, who make up about 15 percent of the population, have tried to stay out of the fighting, stopping both rebel and regime forces from entering their areas.

&gt;However in some areas, such as the Sheikh Maqsud district of Aleppo city, rebels and Kurdish groups have joined together to fight forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.

&gt;Kuwait urged its citizens on Sunday to avoid traveling to Lebanon and those who are there to “leave as quickly as possible,” following a speech by Hezbollah chief Hasan Nasrallah that pointed to an imminent escalation between Lebanese factions.

&gt;The country’s foreign ministry said in a statement published by the KUNA news agency that Kuwait is closely monitoring developments in the security situation in Lebanon with “grave concern and expressed hope the fellow Arab country overcome this period soon.”

&gt;On Saturday Hezbollah leader officially announced the group’s engagement in Syria, fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad’s forces. Nasrallah vowed “victory” and challenged rival Lebanese factions to fight his group in Syria.

&gt;“I say to all the honorable people, to the mujahedeen, to the heroes: I have always promised you a victory and now I pledge to you a new one” in Syria, he said at a ceremony marking the 13th anniversary of Israel’s military withdrawal from Lebanon.

&gt;Nasrallah said Hezbollah would always stand by its allies in the Syrian regime of President Bashar al-Assad, stressing that its own interests were at stake.

&gt;“We will continue along the road... bear the responsibilities and the sacrifices,” he said in a video link of a speech delivered live on a huge screen.

&gt;A rocket was fired from southern Lebanon towards Israel late Sunday night, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported.

&gt;The news agency said the rocket was fired from a location near the southern town of Marjayoun, about six miles (10 kilometers) north of the Israeli border. It was not immediately clear who fired the rocket or whether it caused any damage or casualties.

&gt;The Israeli military did not confirm that a rocket was fired, but said residents in northern Israel reported hearing an explosion. The military said it was searching the area and trying to determine the circumstances behind the explosion.

*Firmer details on the suspected Islamist attack on a soldier in France yesterday.*

&gt;A uniformed French soldier on an antiterrorism patrol in the western suburbs of Paris was wounded in the neck Saturday by a robed assailant wielding a box cutter, police and subway authorities said.

&gt;The soldier was reported to be out of danger after being transported to a nearby military hospital. But the attack sent a shudder through the French capital because it recalled the gory killing of a soldier in the streets of London on Wednesday allegedly by a pair of homegrown Muslim extremists, an act that the British government called terrorism.

&gt;The lone attacker was described as a young man wearing a Muslim prayer cap and a North African-style robe called a jellabah. According to a police account, he was monitored on security cameras and seen shedding his robe and fleeing in European clothes before disappearing into the crowd in a subway and train entrance.

&gt;A broad manhunt was launched to track him down. President Francois Hollande, in a televised statement from Ethiopia, where he is on a state visit, urged security authorities to “look at all the possibilities” as they investigate the assault.

&gt;Syria has missiles aimed for Tel Aviv and is ready to use them should Israel decide to conduct a strike on Syria, UK paper The Sunday Times reported on Sunday.

&gt;The report comes amidst a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the Middle East and Syria in particular after Israel allegedly carried out an airstrike on multiple targets in Syria a couple of weeks ago.

&gt;Until now, Syria has restrained from a military response.

**[Al-Arabiya]**

&gt;Battles raged in Qusayr between fighters from the Lebanese Shiite militant group Hezbollah and the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA), as activists reported the killing of at least 10 Hezbollah members.

&gt;Sources told Al Arabiya early Sunday morning that Hezbollah fighters are reportedly heading to Qusayr, located in the central Homs province.

&gt;The town is a strategic boon to the rebels, AFP said. The opposition uses it as a base from which to block the main road from Damascus to the coast, impeding military movement and supply chains.

&gt;Bashar al-Assad’s forces, backed by Hezbollah fighters, continue to battle the rebels in order to gain full control over the city.

&gt;Qusayr is very close to the Lebanese-Syrian border.

&gt;According to Al Arabiya, a battalion of opposition fighters had earlier set a trap along the banks of the Assi river on the Syrian side of the Lebanese border. The battle saw the deaths of at least 10 Hezbollah fighters and wounded dozens more as they attempted to enter Syrian territory.

&gt;Activists told AFP on Saturday that Qusayr is surrounded by government forces on three sides, and approximately 25,000 residents are believed to still be in the city.

&gt;A military source told AFP last week that the Syrian army dropped leaflets over Qusayr warning civilians to leave before an attack is launched on the rebels who are allegedly holding the town and won’t surrender.

*A bit more on the story about Syria having trained its missiles on Israel, from Haaretz:*

&gt;Syria is making preparations to strike Tel Aviv in case Israel launches another attack on its territory, The Sunday Times reported on Sunday.

&gt;The Syrian army has begun deploying advanced surface-to-surface missiles, the report said, adding that it has received orders to strike central Israel in case additional attacks against Syria are carried out.

&gt;The Sunday Times said that the information was obtained by reconnaissance satellites that were tracking the Syrian forces. According to the report, Syria was deploying advanced Tishreen missiles which are capable of carrying a half-ton warhead.

&gt;Syrian activists say regime airstrikes and heavy shelling of a strategic town near the Lebanese border have killed at least 16 people, including opposition fighters, the Associated Press reported citing a watchdog.

&gt;The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says 16 people were killed Sunday in the rebel-held Qusayr but that the death toll is expected to rise.

&gt;Qusayr is home to about 20,000 residents and has been besieged for weeks by government troops. Opposition activists say members of the Lebanese militant Hezbollah group are also fighting with President Bashar Assad’s troops in the area.

&gt;Hezbollah denies taking part in Syria’s two-year conflict – which has killed at least 80,000 people, according to the U.N. However, the group – an ally of the Syrian regime – has held regular funerals of Hezbollah fighters, who – it said – were killed serving their “jihadi duties.”

&gt;Early May, spokesperson of the rebel Free Syrian Army (FSA) Louay Almokdad told Al Arabiya that Hezbollah was using artillery shells containing fatal Mustard Gas in the area.

&gt;The town is strategically important because it links Damascus with the coast, where regime loyalists are concentrated. This includes Alawites, followers of a Shiite offshoot to which the Assad family belongs. The rebellion against Assad is largely driven by Syria’s majority Sunnis.

&gt;The Syrian Revolution General Commission, a network of activists on the ground, also reported an intense bombardment of Qusayr, which the Syrian regime has been trying to recapture.

&gt;“A rain of shells on the city, at the same time as artillery fire and mortar fire from dawn. Homes were destroyed and burnt down,” AFP reported the group as saying.

&gt;The Qusayr district of Homs province has been the focus of fierce fighting between government forces and the rebels in recent weeks.

&gt;Syrian government forces have surrounded the rebel stronghold of Qusair and are storming it from several directions, says Syrian state TV.

&gt;Fighting has gone on around the town, near the Lebanese border, for weeks.

&gt;Syrian opposition activists said government air strikes and heavy shelling had killed at least 16 people in the town so far.

&gt;Opposition groups say militants from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement are fighting alongside government forces.

&gt;There are also reports that hundreds of Lebanese Sunni militants have joined the fight on the rebels' side, says the BBC's Jim Muir, in Beirut.

&gt;Both sides in the conflict describe fierce hostilities around Qusair, where rebels have been under siege for weeks.

&gt;Activists have reported heavy bombardment since the early morning.

&gt;Our correspondent says the town is of strategic importance for both sides.

&gt;It would give the government command over routes between the capital Damascus and the coast, while for the rebels, it means they can come and go freely from neighbouring Lebanon, our correspondent says.

&gt;Last week, the US state department said it was concerned about reports that Syrian forces had dropped leaflets on Qusair, warning that it would come under attack if opposition forces failed to surrender.

&gt;An Arab League committee on Syria will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday ahead of an international peace conference on ending the country’s civil war, the bloc’s deputy leader said on Sunday.

&gt;The foreign ministers of Algeria, Egypt, Iraq, Oman, Qatar and Sudan would discuss a U.S.-Russian push for a conference aimed at finding a political solution to the Syria conflict, Ahmed Ben-Hilli told reporters.

&gt;Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would also join the meeting “to follow up on developments in Syria in light of the U.S.-Russian understanding,” he said.

&gt;The conference is meant to include both rebels and members of the regime -- a difficulty considering some opposition members’ refusal to recognize President Bashar Al-Assad as a negotiating partner.

&gt;Moscow is also calling for the inclusion on this occasion of its trading partner Iran and U.S. ally Saudi Arabia as a counterweight.

**[The Telegraph]**

&gt;Jabhat al-Nusra, the much-feared militant jihadist group that has taken control of large rebel-held areas of northern Syria, has split in two following its leadership's public declaration of allegiance to al-Qaeda.

&gt;Some of its fighters have withdrawn from the front line against the Assad regime in the northern Syrian city of Aleppo, rebel leaders there have told The Daily Telegraph, and appear to have turned their back on their Syrian leader.

&gt;Many Jabhat fighters had been recruited from other, rival militias with the promise of better-funded and better-organised units rather than for ideological reasons.

&gt;But they are said to have become disillusioned since their Syrian leader, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, affirmed his loyalty to al-Qaeda after an apparent takeover at the top of Jabhat by hardline jihadists from Iraq.

&gt;""The group has split,"" Mohammed Najib Bannan, the head of the Aleppo Judicial Committee's military arm, said. The committee is backed by the major rebel brigades and runs civil and criminal courts in Aleppo alongside the city's Sharia court.

&gt;Jabhat al-Nusra is also said to have withdrawn from the court system. Mr Bannan said this appeared to be the case, although Jabhat al-Nusra had made no statement on the subject. ""Some of Jabhat al-Nusra supported al-Jolani's statement, and some disagreed,"" he said.

&gt;There has been an upsurge in fighting in the strategic Syrian town of Qusair, both sides in the conflict say.

&gt;The army, which began an offensive to recapture Qusair last Sunday, says it has now launched a three-pronged attack on the rebel-held town.

&gt;The rebels say they are under heavy bombardment from Lebanese Hezbollah militants, who back Syria's government.

&gt;The fighting in Qusair, a strategically important town between Homs and the Lebanese border, intensified early on Saturday.

&gt;The town was hit by heavy bombardments, including two ground-to-ground missiles and an air strike as well as artillery and rocket fire, activists say.

&gt;They say Hezbollah fighters, who are widely reported to have played a major role in the attack on Sunday, were trying to advance again.

&gt;Syrian state media said the army had launched a three-pronged offensive in the north, centre and south of the town, and was making big advances, killing many rebel fighters.

&gt;However the official media made no mention of the part played by Hezbollah.

&gt;The Lebanese group is also known to have lost a number of fighters in Qusair, prompting Lebanese President Michel Suleiman to warn the Shia militia against getting ""bogged down in the sands of discord"".

**[Al-Arabiya]**

&gt;Iraqi forces mounted a massive operation on Saturday to better secure the country’s western desert amid concerns it is being used by Sunnis heading to fight in neighboring Syria.

&gt;Some 20,000 troops attacked suspected hideouts of fighters linked to Sunni militant groups, including Al-Qaeda, and looked to secure a key road leading to Syria, top officers said.

&gt;Troops were also moved to the 600-kilometre (375-mile) border with Syria.

&gt;“The operation is large and backed by the air force,” Staff General Ali Ghaidan Majeed, the head of ground forces, told AFP. “It has resulted in the arrest of several Al-Qaeda members and the destruction of some of their strongholds.”

&gt;“The target of the operation is also to clean the desert of the terrorist elements that exist there.”

&gt;Two senior commanders in Al-Qaeda’s local front group, the Islamic State of Iraq, were among those killed.

&gt;Majeed did not say how many troops had been sent to the border.

&gt;The operation is being carried out in parts of border provinces Anbar and Nineveh, where Iraqi and Western officials are concerned that Sunni militant groups opposed to the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and to Iraq’s Shiite-led government have set up camp.

&gt;Among the mostly-Sunni rebels fighting Assad’s regime are groups allied to Al-Qaeda. That has fuelled fears in Baghdad of a spillover from neighboring Syria increasing tensions and violence in Iraq.

&gt;The leader of Lebanese guerilla movement Hezbollah said his group would stay in the Syrian war ""to the end of the road"" and bring victory to its ally President Bashar Assad.

&gt;Hassan Nasrallah, head of the militant Shi'ite Muslim group, said in a televised speech on Saturday Syria and Lebanon were under threat from radical Sunni Islamists.

&gt;""We will continue to the end of the road, we accept this responsibility and will accept all sacrifices and expected consequences of this position,"" he said, speaking from an an undisclosed location. ""We will be the ones who bring it victory, God willing,"" he added.

&gt;Meanwhile, Hezbollah’s deputy secretary general said on Saturday: “We help anyone willing to provide resistance against Israel, and we have the power to deal with any folly by the Zionist regime,” according to semi-official Iranian news site Mehr News Agency.

&gt;In an interview with Al-Mayadeen, Sheikh Naim Qassim, said:  “Our position on Syria is based on righteous demand, and anyone who is with resistance movement we'll be supporter of him as well.”

&gt;According to Mehr, Qassim commented on recent efforts of European countries to include Hezbollah on the list of terrorist groups, saying that ""the defeated and frustrated [West] has described Hezbollah as the ‘Party of Satan’.”

&gt;Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler blamed groups supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to be behind the twin car bombings in Turkey on Saturday, which killed at least 43 people and left 140 wounded.

&gt;“The people and the organization who carried out this attack have been identified. We have established that they are linked to groups supporting the Syrian regime and its intelligence services,” Guler told national TRT television, as quoted by Reuters.

&gt;Turkey reserves the right to take ""every kind of measure"" after car bomb attacks which killed more than 40 people in the southern town of Reyhanli near the border with Syria on Saturday, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said.

&gt;Speaking to reporters in Berlin, Davutoglu said he would discuss the matter with Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan but said he saw no need for an emergency meeting of the NATO military alliance following the attacks.

&gt;Turkey has in the past invoked NATO's article four, which provides for states to ""consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened.""

&gt;Syrian rebels have released four Filipino peacekeepers captured earlier this week, Al Jazeera reported. A Syrian rebel group identified as the 'Yarmouk martyrs brigade' abducted four UN peacekeepers monitoring a ceasefire line between Syria and the Israel-occupied Golan Heights. The peacekeepers were reportedly transferred to Israel. 

&gt;The rebel group claimed it detained the UN troops for their own safety. The men were seized while on patrol near the Syrian village of Jamla, the same area where 21 Filipino observers were taken and held for three days in March, a UN spokesperson said. The Yarmouk martyrs brigade was also responsible for the March abductions.

&gt;Turkey accused a group with links to Syrian intelligence of carrying out car bombings that killed 46 people in a Turkish border town, and said on Sunday it was time for the world to act against the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

&gt;The two car bombs, which ripped through crowded shopping streets in Reyhanli on Saturday, increased fears that Syria's civil war is dragging in neighboring states, despite renewed diplomatic moves to end it.

&gt;Damascus denied involvement, but Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said those behind the attacks were from an ""old Marxist terrorist organization"" with ties to Assad's administration.

&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey will not fall for a “dirty scenario” and be dragged into the conflict with Syria.
Erdogan was speaking Sunday, a day after two car bombings in a town near the Syrian border killed 46 people and raised fears that Turkey may be drawn into the conflict.

&gt;Erdogan says “we have to maintain our extreme cool-bloodedness in the face of efforts and provocations to drag us into the bloody quagmire in Syria.”

&gt;He say that “those who attack Turkey will be held to account sooner or later.”

&gt;Officials say that nine Turkish citizens believed to be link to the Syrian intelligence agency have been detained in connection with the bombings.

&gt;Nine Turkish citizens believed to have links to the Syrian intelligence agency have been detained in connection with twin car bombings that shattered a Turkish border town, officials said Sunday, as Syria rejected allegations it was behind one of the deadliest attacks in Turkey in years.

&gt;The bombings left 46 people dead and marked the biggest incident of violence across the border since the start of Syria’s bloody civil war, raising fears of Turkey being pulled deeper into the conflict.

&gt;Harsh accusations from both sides signaled a sharp escalation of already high tensions between the two former allies, with Turkey vowing a strong response and Syria branding Turkey’s prime minister “a butcher.”

&gt;“This incident was carried out by an organization ... which is in close contact to pro-regime groups in Syria and I say this very clearly, with the Syrian mukhabarat,” said Turkish Interior Minister Muammer Guler. He did not name the organization.

&gt;Among the nine people detained overnight was the mastermind of the attack and more were expected, Guler said.

&gt;“We have determined that some of them were involved in the planning, in the exploration and in the hiding of the vehicles,” he said.

&gt;A Syrian opposition commander has accused Israel of working with Iran and Hezbollah to support Syrian President Bashar Assad in his two year effort to topple opposing forces, Turkish news network Today's Zaman reported on Sunday. 

&gt;Abdulkader Saleh, a commander in the al-Tawhid Brigade of the Free Syrian Army told Today's Zaman that ""Assad has protected Israel's border for 40 years,” and that is why ""Iran and Hezbollah are cooperating with Israel to be able to support Assad"" in Syria's raging civil war. 

&gt;Despite previous media reports that last week's airstrikes in Syria were an Israeli initiative to aid rebel forces and stop Hezbollah from helping Assad attain destructive weapons, Saleh apparently told Zaman that these reports were false.

&gt;Syrian forces fired into Israeli territory on Monday night, the third such incident this week. At approximately 1:00 AM, Syrian forces fired at IDF troops patrolling near Tel Fares in the central Golan Heights. No one was wounded, but an army jeep was damaged.

&gt;Following the incident, the Artillery Corps returned fire with precision Tammuz missiles. IDF officials said that a military response to the firing incidents on the border was being considered in detail and in accordance with a situation assessment in progress. It is not yet known whether the gunfire was aimed at the IDF troops or was stray fire from the nearby fighting between the Syrian army and the rebels.

&gt;Earlier this week, IDF troops were fired upon near Tel Hazeka in two separate incidents. There were no injuries or damage in either incident. While the IDF did not return fire, IDF officials sent a message to the UNDOF troops charged with maintaining the cease-fire between Israel and Syria.

&gt;This is the third time the IDF has fired a Tammuz missile in response to Syrian fire at Israel. The Tammuz missiles, which are fired by the Artillery Corps, are capable of precision strikes at targets up to 25 kilometers away, using an electro-optic sensor. The estimated cost of every Tammuz missile is half a million shekels.

&gt;During the Shavuot holiday, mortar shells were fired at Mount Hermon for the first time since the stray gunfire from the civil war in Syria began. A Palestinian group took responsibility for the gunfire, which took place on Nakba Day. After the incident, IDF officials closed the site to visitors and later reopened it. After the chief of staff met with the Northern Command to discuss the incident, a decision was made not to retaliate.

&gt;Dozens of people, mostly combatants, have been killed in ongoing battles for the Syrian town of Qusayr, a watchdog said Tuesday, as Hezbollah sent new elite fighters to the rebel stronghold.

&gt;Meanwhile, in northern Lebanon, new shells launched from inside Syria injured nine people, an official said.

“Hezbollah has sent new elite troops to Qusayr. They have already taken many prisoners from among the rebels, including non-Syrians,” a source close to Hezbollah told AFP on condition of anonymity.

&gt;Meanwhile, the Observatory’s Abdel Rahman described the rebels’ resistance in Qusayr as “fierce”.

“The rebels are putting up a fierce resistance, refusing to abandon the civilians,” he said.

&gt;“But Hezbollah and the loyalist army are staging an extremely fierce assault,” he added.
At least 40 Hezbollah fighters were killed in the Syrian town of Qusayr late on Sunday, sources told Al Arabiya, following clashes between Syrian rebels and regime forces who attempted to enter the town earlier in the day.

&gt;Sources also told Al Arabiya that tens of Hezbollah members were wounded during the fight and had been taken to hospitals in Beirut, Lebanon for treatment.

&gt;The assault on Qusayr appeared to be part of a campaign by President Bashar al-Assad’s forces to consolidate their grip on Damascus and secure links between the capital and the government strongholds on the coast via the contested central city of Homs.

&gt;State news agency SANA said the army had “restored security and stability to most Qusayr neighborhoods” and was “chasing the remnants of the terrorists in the northern district”.

&gt;Lebanese Hezbollah fighters and Syrian soldiers, backed by air strikes and artillery, renewed an offensive aimed at driving Syrian rebels from the town of Qusair near the Lebanese border on Tuesday, opposition activists said.

&gt;They said fighting was raging in Qusair, as well as in areas to the east where several army bases are located, and in the Hezbollah-held southern and western approaches to the town.

&gt;One activist, Tareq Murei said rebel brigades in the north and west of Qusair were trying to repel the latest attacks, in which three residents had been killed, bringing the number of rebel and civilian deaths in the last 48 hours to more than 100.

&gt;Syrian state media have said President Bashar Assad's forces had reasserted control over most of Qusair, but Murei said the army-Hezbollah offensive had been ineffectual.

&gt;Authorities will hold a war drill next week based on the scenario of missiles pouring in from multiple fronts, with some carrying chemical warheads. The “targets” in the drill include population centers and strategic facilities.

&gt;Named “Steadfast Home Front 1,” the exercise will simulate the firing of missiles from Syria, Lebanon, and Gaza, and will include two air-raid sirens that will ring out across the country next Monday, May 27.

&gt;During the sirens, members of the public are encouraged to seek a preselected safe zone and drill their responses to missile attack.

&gt;The first siren will sound at 12:30 p.m., and is mainly aimed at schools and work places, while the second, at 7:05 p.m., is to drill families at home.

&gt;The drill will test the responses of all first responders – police, firefighters, and paramedics – as well as the IDF Home Front Command and national and local government, said Home Front Defense Minister Gilad Erdan during a press conference in Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

&gt;“This is one of the lessons the government and emergency responders learned from the Second Lebanon War, when they were caught unprepared, and suffered from a lack of coordination,” Erdan said.

&gt;He added that the risk of an actual chemical attack on Israel was low, and that the main threat remained a conventional missile attack. Some enemy projectiles have conventional warheads made up of several hundred kilograms of explosives, Erdan said.

&gt;“Today, the scenarios we see are different than before. We see Hamas equipping itself in the south, and we see the abilities of Hezbollah, Syria, and Iran,” Erdan added.

&gt;“Our enemies have despaired of trying to conquer Israel and will try to exhaust and terrorize Israeli civilians instead,” the minister said.

&gt;“We once asked if the enemy would dare fire missiles on Ashkelon, Tel Aviv… and Haifa. I think these questions no longer have a place. The answer is clear. The question now is, when will they fire on population centers? It can happen tonight, or next week.”

&gt;The M6 is closed in both directions between two junctions amid reports of a suspicious vehicle at a service station.

&gt;Warwickshire Police have closed the M6 in both directions between junction two near Coventry and junction four near Coleshill.

&gt;There are huge tailbacks and drivers have been advised to avoid the area and plan alternative routes.

&gt;The Highways Agency said they were made aware of the incident by the police at 3.30pm.

&gt;A spokesman said he understood the vehicle was parked in the car park of the northbound side of Corley services.

&gt;John McDevitt - who saw police clearing people from the area - says the van is parked 50 yards away from a petrol station.

&gt;He described a ""massive police presence and traffic chaos"" as a remote-controlled police vehicle made its way towards the suspicious van.

&gt;In a statement Warwickshire Police said: ""Police are dealing with an incident on the M6 motorway near Corley services.

&gt;""The motorway has been closed in both directions and motorists are advised to find alternative routes.""

&gt;Police, firefighters and other emergency responders have spent hours at Plaza Towers Elementary School in Moore, desperately searching for students and staff still unaccounted for after Monday's deadly tornado.
The tornado struck Moore just after 3 p.m. Monday, around the time school normally lets out. As teachers, students and staff took shelter at the school, located at 852 S.W. 11th Street, the massive tornado hit the building. The powerful twister destroyed the school, collapsing walls and turning the structure into nothing more than a large pile of twisted metal and splintered wood.

&gt;Several children and adults were pulled alive from the school. There have been no confirmed deaths at the school, but as many as 20 children are still reported as missing. There are also several adults who are missing.

&gt;Prime Minister Tayyip Recep Erdogan is leaving for Morocco, the first stop on a trip to North Africa as his country is hit by anti-government protests.

&gt;Al Jazeera's Emre Temel sumarises what he had to say in a pre-departure speech:

&gt;* The recent protests were organised by 'extremist elements'.

&gt;* They have nothing to do with Gezi Park (the scene of the first peaceful protest last week over concerns of redevelopment and the loss of green space).

&gt;* Removing off trees from the park is not on the agenda.

&gt;* Out citizens should not be part of this ‘game’.

&gt;* Turkish intelligence is investigating foreign links to the events. 

&gt; * People who are talking about a ‘Turkish Spring’ in their coverage of events do not know Turkey.

United States Secretary of State John Kerry has made comments on Turkey:

""The United States supports full freedom of expression and assembly, including the right of people to peaceful protest, because that is fundamental to any democracy,"" Kerry told reporters at the State Department. He maintained that his comments were not intended as interference in Turkey's internal affairs, but rather an honest expression of the importance the United States places on such values in all countries.

""We are concerned by the reports of excessive use of force by police,"" he said at a joint news conference with the visiting foreign minister of Poland. ""We obviously hope there will be a full investigation of those incidents and full restraint from the police force with respect to those incidents. We urge all people involved ... to avoid any provocations or violence.""

&gt;Syrian rebels including the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front have counter-attacked east of Damascus to retake a town that served as a conduit for arms from Jordan into the capital before it was seized by government forces last month, rebel sources said.

&gt;The rebels' struggle to end four decades of Assad family rule has been complicated in part by internal divisions along ideological and political lines, as well as a shortage of heavy weaponry that could decisively turn the tide of conflict.

&gt;But in a rare move, brigades operating in Ghouta, a largely agricultural region on the eastern outskirts of Damascus, have united under one command to wrest back the town of Otaiba, two miles (3 km) northeast of Damascus international airport.

&gt;""This is a huge target no brigade can deliver on its own, even al-Nusra cannot do it alone, so we all agreed to unite to retake it,"" said a commander whose brigade is one of the 23 taking part in the battle.

&gt;""With God's will this will be a decisive battle in rural Damascus that will stop the advance of the regime army and reopen the supply route.""

&gt;Brigades from the Western-backed rebel General Command and Islamist units joined forces over the weekend and pledged to share weapons and fighters. They took as their flag a white banner with the Muslim declaration of faith: ""There is no god but God; Mohammad is God's prophet""

&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday firmly rejected a Syrian proposal to hold a joint probe over a twin car bomb attack that killed 51 people.

&gt;“The administration in power in Damascus is illegal ... how can we recognize a structure that isn’t even recognized by its own citizens,” Erdogan told reporters before leaving for a meeting with U.S President Barack Obama in Washington on Thursday.
Syria said earlier Tuesday it was willing to carry out a joint investigation with Turkey into the deadly attacks in the border town of Reyhanli that Ankara has accused Damascus of masterminding.

&gt;“If the government of [Prime Minister Recep Tayyip] Erdogan calls for a joint, transparent investigation by the two countries, we have no objection, in order to find the truth,” Information Minister Omran al-Zohbi had said.

&gt;“The truth must be announced to the Syrian and Turkish people,” he was quoted as saying by state media.

&gt;Saturday’s twin car bombings also wounded dozens.

&gt;Turkish police have arrested 13 suspects.

&gt;Hizbullah fighters have been advancing swiftly into southern Syria and have reached the flashpoint southern town of Daraa near the border with Jordan, media reports said on Tuesday.

&gt;A source close to Hizbullah told the Kuwaiti al-Qabas newspaper that Hizbullah fighters played a significant role in helping the regime troops to take full power of the strategic town of Kherbet Ghazleh near the highway linking the capital Damascus with Jordan.

&gt;The source pointed out that Hizbullah fighters are not just groups backing the army regime but comprehensive fighting units that includes a full logistic team.

&gt;It said that Hizbullah's military leadership is organizing the transfer of the units and providing them with weapons.

&gt;Last week, rebels withdrew from Khirbet Ghazaleh area after several days of fighting.

&gt;Government forces conducted house-to-house searches Monday as troops reopened the highway, restoring the supply line between Damascus and the contested provincial capital of Daraa.

&gt;A Syrian rebel leader says he ate the heart of a government soldier as revenge for atrocities committed by the government.

&gt;Gruesome video footage, which has sparked international condemnation, shows Khalid al-Hamad taking a bite from the heart.

&gt;US-based group Human Rights Watch says he then urges his followers to do the same to Alawites - the Muslim sect that Syrian president Bashar al-Assad belongs to.

&gt;Time magazine says it has talked by Skype with Hamad.

&gt;It says Hamad claimed he was driven to the gruesome acts by footage on the dead soldier's mobile phone, showing him ""humiliating"" a naked woman and her two daughters.

&gt;""Hopefully we will slaughter all of them,"" he told the magazine, referring to Alawites.

&gt;""They were the ones who killed our children in Baba Amr and raped our women,"" he said, referring to a neighbourhood of the central city of Homs.

&gt;""We didn't start it, they started it.

&gt;Four shells originating in Syria struck the outskirts of the Lebanese border town Al-Qaa in the Bekaa Valley Tuesday, marking the first time the area has been subject to attack, security sources told The Daily Star.

&gt;The sources said the rockets, which fell on the foothills of Mzar al-Saydeh, were fired in the afternoon and added that there were no reported casualties.

&gt;Al-Qaa borders the Syrian village of Jousieh in Qusair, where regime forces and rebel groups have been engaged in a fierce battle over control of the area. Hezbollah has said its fighters are helping the Lebanese of Qusair defend themselves against rebel attacks.

&gt;This was the first time that shells fell on Mzar al-Saydeh, located some 1,500 meters away from Al-Qaa, a small town with an estimated 10,000 Christian population.

&gt;Britain and France have delayed a Syrian request for Islamist al-Nusra Front to be designated by the United Nations as a terrorist group because they want the militants to instead be listed as an alias of al-Qaida, diplomats said on Tuesday.

&gt;The UN Security Council's al Qaida sanctions committee is due to discuss the counter-proposal by Britain and France for listing Nusra later this week, said council diplomats, speaking on the condition of anonymity.

&gt;The issue is procedural as either way Nusra would still be listed on the al Qaida sanctions list and be subject to the same arms embargo, travel bans and asset freeze. All 15-members of the sanctions committee must agree for Nusra to be listed.

&gt;US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met late on Tuesday for a discussion focused on the war in Syria and plans for an international peace conference, a senior State Department official said.

&gt;Kerry updated his Russian counterpart on his discussions with the Syrian rebels and officials from countries involved in the talks and his plans to participate in a meeting in Jordan next week ahead of the international conference, a senior State Department official said.

&gt;Russia has been a staunch ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, blocking new sanctions against Syria at the United Nations and supplying the government with arms.

&gt;Kerry had said earlier on Tuesday he expected the proposed peace conference to be held in early June, and denied reports that the Damascus government did not plan to attend.

&gt;Last week, a 12-member delegation from the Syrian opposition visited Saudi Arabia, for an unprecedented two-day official meeting.

&gt;Saudi authorities had consistently declined to meet the opposition, despite repeated requests. This was partly because the kingdom has opposed Muslim Brotherhood dominance in the Syrian National Council and then the National Coalition, owing to the Brotherhood's alliance with Qatar and Turkey and opposition to inclusivity.

&gt;Lebanese members of the Syrian leader’s Alawite sect fear their tiny community will be a casualty of the civil war raging in the neighboring country.

&gt;Already, Sunni Muslim extremists have stoned a school bus, vandalized stores and beaten or stabbed a number of men in a wave of attacks against Lebanese Alawites, stoking fears of even more violence should Syrian President Bashar Assad be removed from power.

&gt;In one particularly humiliating case, angry Sunnis tied a rope around an Alawite man’s neck and dragged him around the streets of Tripoli.

&gt;“The Alawites are being subjected to an organized campaign that aims to eliminate them on all levels,” said Ali Feddah, a prominent member of Lebanon’s Arab Democratic Party, which is mainly Alawite.

&gt;The U.N. General Assembly is set to vote on Wednesday on a draft resolution that condemns Syrian authorities and accepts the opposition Syrian National Coalition as party to a potential political transition.

&gt;Russia, a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, is opposed to the resolution, which was drafted by Qatar and other Arab nations and circulated among the 193 U.N. member states. Some Western diplomats said it was unlikely to win as many votes as a resolution that passed last year with 133 in favor.

&gt;No country has a veto in the General Assembly.

&gt;""I'm convinced a lot of countries voted for this text because they believed they were voting for the winning side,"" a senior western U.N. diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in reference to the August, 2012 resolution. ""They are not so sure anymore.""

&gt;""Now also you have the Islamist, terrorist factor which is much more conspicuous,"" he said.

&gt;Iran persuaded Syrian President Bashar Assad to allow Hezbollah to open ""a new front"" from which to attack Israel in the Golan Heights, Israel Radio reported Wednesday citing a report by the pan-Arab newspaper Al-Hayat.

&gt;According the report, an Iranian source told the newspaper that Tehran is determined to prevent the fall of Assad's regime in Damascus, because the Syrian president has been convinced to open the Golan to all Arabs and Muslim wanting to fight Israel.

&gt;The UN General Assembly on Wednesday condemned Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces and praised the opposition Syrian National Coalition, but support for the Gulf Arab-drafted declaration was less than a similar text received last year.

&gt;While the non-binding text has no legal force, resolutions adopted by the 193-nation assembly can carry significant moral and political weight. The vote result - 107 in favor, 12 against and 59 abstentions - contrasted sharply with that of a resolution that passed last year with 133 in favor.

&gt;UN diplomats said the decline in support for Wednesday's resolution showed growing unease about Syria's fractious rebel groups fighting Assad's forces in the two-year civil war.

&gt;The website of Britain’s Financial Times appeared to have been hacked on Friday by the Syrian Electronic Army, a mysterious group seemingly aligned with the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.

&gt;The hackers posted messages on the prestigious newspaper’s technology blog reading “Hacked by the Syrian Electronic Army,” while several Twitter feeds run by the Financial Times were also plastered with posts saying: “Syrian Electronic Army Was Here.”

&gt;A spokeswoman for the FT said: “Various FT blogs and social media accounts have been compromised by hackers, and we are working to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.”

&gt;International sanctions have piled up against SyrianAir but the carrier is operating at full capacity as civil war has made domestic road travel perilous and Syrian expatriates have few alternatives to get home to see family.
The U.S. Treasury imposed new restrictions on the airline on Thursday accusing it of ferrying weapons for the military but SyrianAir’s domestic flights all have long waiting lists as it offers civilians the safest way to get around.

&gt;“Now that the summer has arrived, we going to increase our flights from the Gulf as many Syrians want to come home for the holidays despite the situation.” 

&gt;But it is SyrianAir’s internal flights that have seen the biggest surge in demand as travelers have abandoned the coaches and shared taxis that used to be the preferred means to get around and taken to the skies.

&gt;“The troubles have changed the mindset of Syrians,” Wahiba said.

&gt;“Before, they’d have never thought of taking the plane. Now it’s the other way round, they’d not even think about travelling by car.”

&gt;Al Qaeda's Iraq-based wing, which nurtured Nusra in the early stages of the rebellion against Assad, has moved in and sidelined the organization, Nusra sources and other rebels say.

&gt;Al Qaeda in Iraq includes thousands of foreign fighters whose ultimate goal is not toppling Assad but the anti-Western jihad of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri - a shift which could extend Syria's conflict well beyond any political accord between Assad and his foes. The fighting has already cost 90,000 lives.

&gt;The break-up of an important part of Syria's opposition, already splintered into hundreds of armed groups, worsens the dilemma faced by the West as it debates whether intervention to support the rebels will result in arms being placed in the hands of hostile Islamist militants. And the if the West were to intervene, it may now be under pressure to attack al Qaeda opposition forces rather than Assad

&gt;""Nusra is now two Nusras. One that is pursuing al Qaeda's agenda of a greater Islamic nation, and another that is Syrian with a national agenda to help us fight Assad,"" said a senior rebel commander in Syria who has close ties to the Nusra Front.

&gt;""It is disintegrating from within.""

&gt;Russia’s shipment of alleged missiles to Syria could “embolden” President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and prolong the country’s civil war, a top U.S. military official said on Friday.

&gt;“It's at the very least an unfortunate decision that will embolden the regime and prolong the suffering, so it's ill-timed and very unfortunate,” General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at the Pentagon.

&gt;Dempsey said his comments were referring specifically to the anti-ship missiles. Reuters reported earlier on Friday that they had been sent by Russia to Syria.

&gt;Meanwhile, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki expressed U.S. concerns about Russian arms shipments to the Arab country.

&gt;Psaki, however, downplayed the reports as nothing new. 

&gt;“We remain concerned about any aid that is being provided to help the Syrian regime by the Russians or anyone else, including any form of missile,” Psaki said as quoted by AFP.

&gt;“That’s a concern we’ve expressed publicly, and the secretary and others have expressed privately as well.”

&gt;According to a report released on Friday by The New York Times, Russia sent Syria a shipment of upgraded Yakhonts anti-ship missiles that would make any naval blockade of Syria more difficult.

&gt;Recent deliveries of advanced Russian missiles to Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces could embolden the regime into making a critical ""miscalculation,"" triggering a regional war. 

&gt;The shipments of Russian-built anti-ship missiles to Assad's forces was ""an unfortunate decision that will embolden the regime,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Martin Dempsey said Friday. 

&gt;Russia had previously provided the anti-ship cruise missiles, Yakhonts, to the Syrians, but the latest shipment includes advanced radar technology, The New York Times reported Friday. 
Those weapons and Moscow's continued support of Assad's bloody offensive against Syrian rebels in the three-year-old civil war, could create a false sense of security among government forces, Dempsey told reporters during a press briefing at the Pentagon. 

&gt;That sense of security, Dempsey added, could prompt Assad's force into making a ""miscalculation"" in their efforts to quash rebel forces, such as using chemical weapons against the opposition. 

&gt;That action, or similar actions, would all but guarantee the civil war boiling over into a regional conflict.

&gt;The prospect of enhanced cross-border aid access to crisis-torn Syria is being mulled by the U.N. Security Council as the bloc considers a plea from U.N. aid officials to demand access through bordering countries.

&gt;U.N. diplomats told Reuters news agency late Friday that there are millions in need of aid inside Syria, while the influx of Syrian refugees into neighboring Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq reached 1.5 million.

&gt;“The key element (of a humanitarian resolution) would be insisting on cross-border access,” said a senior Security Council diplomat, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity.

&gt;“We don’t want to open up divisions (between the permanent five council members) ... just before Geneva,” he said. “If (the Western council members) are going to have that battle with the Russians then it may be better to have it after Geneva.”

&gt;But a decision on a new resolution in the 15-member council could be left until a planned Syria peace conference in Geneva next month, U.N. diplomats said.

&gt;Western leaders have been cautious about the prospects of the Syria conference in Geneva achieving any breakthrough, and Russia’s desire that Iran should attend has complicated matters.

**[AP]**

&gt;A Syrian group that tracks the country's civil war says 23 fighters from the militant group Hezbollah have been killed in fierce clashes in a strategic town near the Lebanese border.

&gt;The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the fighters died in the fighting Sunday around the rebel-held town of Qusair. More than 100 have been wounded.

&gt;Observatory director Rami Abdul-Rahman cited ""sources close to the militant group"" but declined to reveal their identity. The Observatory relies on a wide network of activists in the ground in Syria.

**[09:49 UTC]** **Major Update**

**[Al-Jazeera]**

&gt;Sporadic gun fire continued on Monday in Lebanon's Tripoli between residents of neighbouring areas.

&gt;The largely Sunni neighbourhood of Bab al-Tabbaneh supports Syria's predominantly Sunni rebels, and the adjacent Alawite neighbourhood of Jabal Mohsen supports Syrian President Bashar Assad.

&gt;The army is returning fire, and has been raiding certain areas since the morning.

&gt;Schools and the majority of shops are closed, but the rest of main Tripoli is operating as normal. 

&gt;As of yesterday, two people were reported dead and more than 40 wounded.

&gt;Lebanese soldiers were seen in the area, with troops in armoured personnel carriers opening fire with heavy machine guns at unseen targets.

&gt;The clashes broke out on Sunday in the afternoon.

&gt;Overnight gunfire from Syria hit the central Israeli-occupied Golan Heights near an Israeli military patrol, an Al Arabiya correspondent reported on Monday.
An Israeli military spokeswoman confirmed that shots were fired, but it was not clear whether the gunfire was intentional.

&gt;The shots were ""most likely were stray bullets, we don't know if it was intentional,"" the spokeswoman told AFP news agency, adding that the Israeli army had not fired back and that Israel had submitted a complaint to the United Nations force in the region.

&gt;Israel seized 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) of the strategic Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War, which it later annexed, a move never recognized by the international community.
The Golan Heights have been tense since the beginning of the conflict in Syria more than two years ago.

&gt;However, there have been only minor flare-ups in the region to date, with Syrian shells crashing in the occupied Golan and Israel firing in retaliation.

&gt;In recent weeks there were four incidents of fire coming from Syria and straying across the ceasefire line.

&gt;At least 40 Hezbollah fighters have been reportedly killed in the Syrian town of Qusayr late on Sunday, sources told Al Arabiya, following clashes between Syrian rebels and regime forces who attempted to enter the town earlier in the day.

&gt;Sources also told Al Arabiya that tens of Hezbollah members were wounded during the fight and had been taken to hospitals in Beirut, Lebanon for treatment.

&gt;The assault on Qusayr appeared to be part of a campaign by President Bashar al-Assad's forces to consolidate their grip on Damascus and secure links between the capital and the government strongholds on the coast via the contested central city of Homs.

&gt;State news agency SANA said the army had ""restored security and stability to most Qusayr neighborhoods"" and was ""chasing the remnants of the terrorists in the northern district"".

&gt;Meanwhile, sources said that Hezbollah official Fady al-Jazzar was reportedly among those killed. Al-Jazzar is considered to be a high ranking Hezbollah officer and was imprisoned in Israel until he returned to Lebanon in a prisoner-exchange deal.

&gt;News on his death came after contact was lost with the group that was under his command, Al Arabiya said.

&gt;Hezbollah MP Nawaf Musawi said on Monday that the Syria crisis is not turning in the US and Israel's favour, amid an ongoing and tense battle between the Hezbollah-backed Syrian military and opposition forces in Qusayr.

&gt;""If some were betting on weakening our ally in Syria [Assad] and toppling him, [they] should keep in mind that two years ... have passed while betting on delusions,"" Musawi said.

&gt;""Those who were banking on US power and Israeli threats of war, and victory of the US-Israeli attack on Syria, are mistaken,"" he said.

&gt;""If the enemy – through its aggression – is practicing brinkmanship with the resistance and its allies in this region, the resistance is not afraid to push the enemy itself into the abyss,"" Musawi said.

&gt;Hezbollah, he warned, has ""enough potential to make any Israeli official aware that the threat of war applies to him and that he will be the first to lose as a result of his behaviour.""

&gt;Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must realize that “no option is off table” if his government fails to negotiate seriously at peace talks in Geneva, Britain’s Foreign Secretary William Hague was reported saying by Reuters Monday.


&gt;“We must make clear that if the regime does not negotiate seriously at the Geneva conference, no option is off the table. There remains a serious risk that the Assad regime will not negotiate seriously,” Hague told parliament.

&gt;Earlier in the week, Assad welcomed the proposed peace talks, which were originally agreed by Russia and the U.S.

&gt;However, he voiced skepticism about their forecasts for success, claiming that many powers are not really looking for a solution. The Syrian President made his comments to an Argentine newspaper Clarin.

&gt;The U.S. and Russia are attempting to bring the Syrian government and the opposition to an international conference in Geneva for peace talks. The reported aim is finding a peaceful resolution to the conflict.

&gt;The gathering is expected to take place next month.

**[Reuters]**

&gt;Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Monday it is crucial for Syrian opposition envoys to engage in peace talks without setting preconditions, apparently referring to demands for President Bashar al-Assad's removal.

&gt;Lavrov also reiterated that Iran must be invited to the conference that Russia and the United States are trying to organize to seek a resolution to the more than two-year-old conflict that has killed at least 80,000 people.

&gt;Days after U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in Russia that the conference should be held ""as soon as possible"" so that momentum is not lost, Lavrov said timing was far less important than ensuring there is a chance for success.

&gt;""It's important to put the main things first, and in this sense I am convinced that timing is the last thing that should be decided, when the most important things are agreed,"" he said after talks with the visiting Council of Europe secretary-general, Thorbjorn Jagland.

&gt;""The main thing is to ensure the agreement of opposition groups to participate in the conference without preliminary conditions,"" he told a news conference. He said Western nations should press Assad's foes not to demand ""unrealistic things"".

&gt;Lavrov also said he had ""no doubt that it is obligatory to invite all neighbors of Syria without exception. Iran, as you know, is a neighbor of Syria."" Iran shares no border with Syria but has long been Assad's staunchest ally in the region.

&gt;The Syrian opposition is demanding access to arms before planned peace talks next month, amid a growing consensus that it may take a shift in the balance of power on the battlefield before any meaningful negotiations can take place.

&gt;Khalid Saleh, a spokesman for the Syrian Opposition Coalition, said Thursday that his group is pushing for “serious arming” of the rebels ahead of the U.S.- and ­Russian-backed negotiations. His comments come as European nations consider linking the lifting of an E.U. arms embargo to the talks.

&gt;“We’re not going to sit at the table while Assad continues to kill, supported by Russia and Hezbollah,” Saleh said. “What we are asking for is arming the Free Syrian Army or Supreme Military Council — before the talks.”

&gt;""Britain and France are pushing the European Union not to renew an arms embargo on Syria that expires May 30, hoping to use the prospect of weapons shipments as an inducement to the opposition to join talks while simultaneously increasing pressure on Assad.

&gt;“We need a stronger, more capable opposition that can make Assad feel vulnerable,” said one European diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive developments. “That is why amending the arms embargo now is so important.”

&gt;Assad “will know that if he does not engage seriously in negotiations, we have the option of sending lethal support to the opposition to force his hand,” the diplomat added.""

&gt;Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that Moscow planned to go ahead with its shipment of S- 300 missiles to Syria, saying the deal had been sealed before the recent air strikes on Syria, reportedly carried out by Israel.

&gt;“Missile defense systems are delivered to protect the country that buys them from air strikes. But these contracts were signed long before air strikes on Syria were launched last year and now,” Lavrov said in an interview with Lebanon’s al-Mayadeen TV channel.

&gt;Moscow is honoring previous agreements and has not signed any new contracts with Damascus, he stressed.

&gt;“Those who do not plan aggressive actions against a sovereign state have nothing to worry about, because air defense methods – and this is clear from the name – are a purely defensive system required to repel air attacks,” Lavrov said.

&gt;Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu reportedly urged Russian President Vladimir Putin in a summit in Sochi on Tuesday not to sell the state-of-the-art S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Syria.

&gt;Israeli officials declined to comment on Lavrov’s latest interview, which appeared to contradict a statement he made last week that Russia would not sell the S-300 advanced air defense system to Syria

&gt;Russia has sent advanced antiship cruise missiles to Syria, a move that illustrates the depth of its support for the Syrian government led by President Bashar al-Assad, American officials said Thursday.

&gt;Russia has previously provided a version of the missiles, called Yakhonts, to Syria. But those delivered recently are outfitted with an advanced radar that makes them more effective, according to American officials who are familiar with classified intelligence reports and would only discuss the shipment on the basis of anonymity.

&gt;Unlike Scud and other longer-range surface-to-surface missiles that the Assad government has used against opposition forces, the Yakhont antiship missile system provides the Syrian military a formidable weapon to counter any effort by international forces to reinforce Syrian opposition fighters by imposing a naval embargo, establishing a no-fly zone or carrying out limited airstrikes.

&gt;“It enables the regime to deter foreign forces looking to supply the opposition from the sea, or from undertaking a more active role if a no-fly zone or shipping embargo were to be declared at some point,” said Nick Brown, editor in chief of IHS Jane’s International Defense Review. “It’s a real ship killer.”

&gt;Hundreds of Iraqis in a southern city have attended the funeral of two Shiite fighters killed in Syria.

&gt;In Basra, mourners on Friday carried the coffin of Mohammed Aboud, who they say was killed by a sniper fire near the shrine of Sayida Zeinab outside the capital of Damascus five days before.

&gt;The coffin of the other slain fighter, Hassan Ali, was rushed to Baghdad at the start of the funeral. Relatives said both bodies were transported from Syria via Iran before being returned to Iraq.

&gt;For months Iraqi Shiite fighters have trickled into Syria, where mostly Sunni rebels are fighting a regime dominated by a Shiite offshoot sect. Their relatives say they are drawn by a sense of religious duty to protect the Sayida Zeinab shrine.

*A bit more on the Russian anti-ship missiles via BBC*

&gt;According to the New York Times report, a recent Russian shipment to Syria included an advanced form of the Yakhont, a 6.7m-long (22ft) missile with a range of 290km (180 miles) and carrying either a high-explosive or armour-piercing warhead.

&gt;The initial order - for 72 missiles along with launcher and support vehicles - was placed in 2007 and the first deliveries received in early 2011, said the paper. It quotes two unnamed senior US defence officials as saying the most recent shipments had more advanced radar guidance systems, enabling it to evade a ship's defences.

&gt;Sergei Lavrov said on Friday he did not understand ""why the media is trying to create a sensation out of this"".

&gt;Facing international criticism for his country's decision to sell the S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Syria, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Friday contended that the arms deal would not alter the balance of power in the region.

&gt;During a meeting in Sochi, Russia with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, Lavrov was quoted by AFP as saying ""this does not in any way alter the balance of forces in this region or give any advantage in the fight against the opposition.""

&gt;Lavrov claimed that Russia's arms deals with Syria do not violate international agreements. ""I do not understand why the media is trying to create a sensation out of this,"" AFP quoted him as saying. 

&gt;""We have not hidden that we supply weapons to Syria under signed contracts, without violating any international agreements, or our own legislation,"" he added.

[Reuters]

&gt;Turkish police have detained a man they believe to be one of the main perpetrators of car bombings that killed more than 50 people near the Syrian border, officials said on Friday.

&gt;Turkey has accused Syria of involvement in the two bombings last weekend in the town of Reyhanli, which fanned fears that Syria's civil war is dragging in neighboring states. Damascus denies any role.

&gt;Local governor Celalettin Lekesiz said police had detained a man identified only by the initials M.G. shortly before midnight on Thursday in Samandag district, near the Syrian border, and that he was being treated as a prime suspect.

&gt;Huseyin Celik, deputy chairman of Turkey's ruling AK Party, said the two vehicles used in the bombings were registered to the man who was detained, and that he had driven one of them to one of the blast sites in Reyhanli.

&gt;Lekesiz said police were still searching for two other suspected perpetrators, who along with M.G. had been trying to cross over into Syria from Samandag but had failed because of stepped-up security along the border.

&gt;The debate over the situation in Syria and President Bashar Assad's chances for survival has sharpened recently within the Israeli defense establishment. A senior defense official claimed recently in closed conversations that Israel has erred in its estimates of how quickly Assad would fall from power in Syria.

&gt;According to the official, Israel has ""underestimated"" Assad's strength and the inner life force of the Syrian regime.

&gt;Currently, their are differing opinions within the defense establishment about what to expect in Syria and what outcome for its northern neighbor would benefit Israel.

&gt;Turkey has shut its side of the last border crossing with Syria still controlled by Syrian President Bashar Assad's government, stepping up security following two deadly bombings this month.

&gt;Fifty-one people were killed when twin car bombs ripped through the Turkish border town of Reyhanli in the southern province of Hatay on May 11, heightening fears that Syria's civil war was dragging in neighboring states.

&gt;Turkey has accused Syria of involvement in the attacks. Damascus has denied any role.

&gt;Customs Minister Hayat Yazici said the Yayladagi gate, some 90 km (55 miles) from Reyhanli, would remain closed for a month, during which only Turkish citizens arriving from Syria or non-Syrians transiting through Turkey would be allowed to cross.

&gt;Nobody would be allowed to cross from Turkey into Syria.

&gt;Lebanese supporters of rival factions in Syria's civil war battled overnight in the city of Tripoli in the worst such bout of spillover violence since the conflict started two years ago.

&gt;One person was killed and many were wounded as Sunni and Shi'ite Muslim gunmen fired mortar bombs and rocket-propelled grenades at each other in a fifth day of clashes in the coastal city, security sources said on Wednesday.

&gt;Syrian activists said the fighting in Tripoli was triggered by an assault on the Syrian border town of Qusair, where fighters from Lebanon's Shi'ite Hezbollah movement are helping Syrian government forces.

&gt;At least 33 people have been killed and more than 120 wounded in Tripoli since it started, the security sources said.

&gt;Tripoli has suffered sporadic sectarian violence since the Suuni-led uprising against President Bashar Assad broke out in February 2012, but residents said this was the fiercest so far.

&gt;US Secretary of State John Kerry said on Wednesday that if Syrian President Bashar Assad was not prepared to discuss a political solution to end Syria's civil war, the United States and others would consider increasing support for his opponents.

&gt;Kerry also told a news conference in the Jordanian capital Amman that there were several thousand fighters from the Lebanese group Hezbollah taking part in Syria's conflict, with Iranian support.

&gt;Commenting on recent offensives by Assad's forces, Kerry said they had made gains on the ground in recent days but said he regarded those gains as ""very temporary"".

&gt;Russia said on Wednesday that the Syrian opposition had not yet shown enough commitment to efforts to arrange a peace conference with President Bashar Assad's government.

&gt;""We also hope that a constructive reaction from various opposition groups ... will follow. So far, however, the news is not hopeful.""

&gt;The United Nations is receiving increasing reports of the use of chemical weapons in Syria's civil war as the violence escalates, a senior UN official said on Wednesday.
&gt;
&gt;""The Secretary-General [Ban Ki-moon] remains gravely concerned about the allegations of the use of chemical weapons,"" Robert Serry, the UN Middle East peace envoy, told the Security Council.
&gt;
&gt;""Amid mounting reports on the use of chemical weapons, we once again urge the government of Syria to allow &gt;the investigation to proceed without further delay,"" he said.
&gt;
&gt;A team of UN-led chemical weapons experts has been ready for more than a month to enter Syria to investigate allegations by rebels and the government that chemical weapons have been used, but has been held up by diplomatic wrangling and safety concerns.

&gt;The threat of a conflict suddenly erupting between Israel and its enemies is very real, Israel Air Force chief Maj.-Gen. Amir Eshel warned on Wednesday.

&gt;The advanced S-300 Russian air defense system is “on the way to Syria,” he added.

&gt;The IDF chief of staff, Lt.- Gen. Benny Gantz, echoed Eshel’s message. The chance of a multi-arena conflict breaking out are “substantial,” he said.

&gt;Eshel, addressing a national security conference held by the Fisher Brothers Institute for Air and Space Strategic Studies in Herzliya, said that “the Assad regime has invested much to achieve the best air defenses that it could buy,” including the SA-17, SA-22, SA-24 and the S-300 platforms.

&gt;“These systems are not only an operational threat.

&gt;They also lead to an increased sense of security that can lead states to do things they would not otherwise do. This is a totally different generation of weapons, which does not resemble anything in the past. But there’s no system that has no solution. The question is only the price,” the air force commander said.

&gt;Syria is “changing before our eyes. If it collapses tomorrow, we could find its vast arsenal dispersed and pointed at us,” he said.

&gt;The threat of a war erupting is “many times more relevant today. A surprise war could be born today in many forms. Lone incidents can escalate very quickly and obligate us to be prepared within hours to act to the edge of the spectrum... meaning using the full abilities of the Israel Air Force,” Eshel said.

[CBS] from last night:

&gt;BELCHERTOWN (CBS) – Shortly after midnight Tuesday, seven people were caught trespassing at the Quabbin Reservoir.

&gt;State Police say the five men and two women are from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore, and “cited their education and career interests” for being in the area. The men told police they were chemical engineers and recent college graduates.

The Quabbin, in Belchertown, is one of the country’s largest man-made public water supplies. Boston’s drinking water comes from the Quabbin and the Wachusett Reservoirs.

&gt;State Police say there were no warrants or advisories on any of the individuals and “there was no evidence that the seven were committing any crime beyond the trespassing.”

&gt;All seven were allowed to leave and will be summonsed to court for trespassing. The FBI is investigating and routine checks of public water supplies have been increased following the incident.

&gt;The seven individuals currently live in Amherst, Cambridge, Sunderland, Northampton and New York City. Police have not released their names because a court date has not been set.

**From the Worcester Telegram:**

&gt;The FBI and state police are investigating seven people — from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Singapore — who were allegedly found inside the confines of the Quabbin Reservoir's watershed area shortly after midnight Tuesday, state police said. 

&gt;Trooper Adam LeBlanc was on patrol at 12:30 a.m. when he noticed two vehicles parked on Route 9 near the middle entrance to the Quabbin and stopped to investigate. He saw five men and two women, who he said he later learned were from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Singapore, emerging from the woods headed to the vehicles. 

&gt;State police spokesman David Procopio said the “young adults” told police they had stopped to look at the reservoir because it was of interest to them. The men told police they are chemical engineers and had graduated from the nearby University of Massachusetts at Amherst. 

&gt;All seven will be summoned to Eastern Hampshire District Court in Belchertown, where they will face trespassing charges. Their names will not be released until they are formally charged, state police said. 

&gt;They had addresses in Amherst, Cambridge, Sunderland, Northampton and New York City, police said, adding that their citizenship status was unknown. 

&gt;Because area water supplies are a potential target for terrorism, state police who patrol watershed areas are always on heightened alert for suspicious activity, Mr. Procopio said. The Quabbin Reservoir provides drinking water to the Boston area. When it is full, it holds 412 billion gallons of water. The reservoir comprises 39 square miles and is surrounded by hundreds of acres of forest land. 

&gt;Quabbin Park was closed for some time after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and the roads atop the Goodnough Dike and Winsor Dam have been closed to motor vehicles since then. In the hours after the Boston Marathon bombing, the park was again closed but reopened the following day. 

&gt;After finding the alleged trespassers, police were concerned and did extensive background checks on them using the Warrant Management System and International Criminal Police Organization. Information about the seven was provided to the state's Fusion Center, which helps police departments share information. 

&gt;“There were no red flags,” Mr. Procopio said, and in a news release he added, “Police did not find any evidence to suspect terrorism or a crime beyond trespassing, but the late hour, the curious explanation for their interest in the reservoir, and the fact that they were inside a restricted area marked as such clearly warrants a closer look and further investigation.” 

&gt;The FBI was alerted, and officials from the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority and Department of Conservation and Recreation were notified. Ware police also assisted. 

&gt;State police said the investigation is ongoing.

**From Boston.com:**

&gt;State Police and FBI agents are investigating seven college-aged individuals from foreign countries who were allegedly trespassing at the Quabbin Reservoir in Ware just after midnight Tuesday morning, State Police said. The seven people, five men and two women, told authorities that they were recent graduates from the University of Massachusetts and Smith College and were at the reservoir for education and career interests, State Police said. The men said they were chemical engineers. A preliminary investigation found the individuals are from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Singapore, but State Police said there are no warrants out for them. All seven were charged with trespassing.

**Update** **[19:57 GMT]**

&gt;Testing done on water samples from the Quabbin Reservoir showed no abnormalities after seven people were seen at a reservoir park entrance shortly after midnight, officials said Wednesday.

&gt;The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority said water quality samples were analyzed at its lab Tuesday and all came back normal after the alleged trespassing incident.

&gt;The central Massachusetts reservoir supplies drinking water to Boston.

**[04:00 GMT] May 16th**

&gt; Water quality at the Quabbin Reservoir remains unchanged two days after a statewide terrorism alert was triggered when state police found a group of people from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Singapore trespassing at the reservoir shortly after midnight Tuesday.

&gt;Officials with the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, which operates the reservoir, said additional testing of the water supply showed the water quality to have normal readings.

&gt;“There is no evidence of any water quality issues at the Quabbin Reservoir following the trespassing incident,” said MWRA spokeswoman Ria Convery. “Any abnormalities are detected immediately.”

&gt;“Further investigation is being undertaken because of the late hour when they were observed, their curious explanation for why they wanted to see the reservoir and the fact that they were in an area marked no trespassing,” he said.

&gt;Special Agent Greg Comcowich, public affairs officer with the FBI office in Boston, said 
the FBI is aid the state police in the investigation, but to this point there is no indication is was an act of terrorism.

##**Community News: Announcing the Establishment of /r/NewsCrowd Teams**
****


****
**Would you like to see more [Live Updates] threads, with more frequent updates?**

****
**We can make it happen. However, we will have to work as a community to do it. We will need your help to make this work.**
 ****
**With your help, we want to begin organizing interested volunteers into ‘coverage teams’.  I’ll do my best to explain this idea.**
****
**What would a NewsCrowd team look like?**

* 1 Team Leader

* 1 or more Team Member(s)

****
**What would a NewsCrowd team do?**

* A NewsCrowd Team would cover, or prepare to cover, news related to some specific or general topic of interest.
* Examples of specific coverage topics include the ongoing crisis in Syria, the 2013 presidential elections in Iran, and the ongoing battle over immigration reform. 
* Examples of general coverage topics include U.S. politics, crime and punishment, finance, the environment, and technology.  
* At the end of the day, what you choose to report on is up to you and your team. If you're interested enough to help cover it, you can be sure that there will be redditors interested in following your coverage.

****
**Why should we bother with something like this? Wouldn’t it just be a whole lot of effort?**

* While it will take a fair bit of effort to make this work, the result will be great. NewsCrowd teams can, if they wish, choose to create a shared account that can be used to run [Live Update] threads for periods of time that would be unreasonable for any one single individual, given the limits of human perseverance. 

* With a team, the workload can be distributed a bit, meaning that the coverage doesn’t have to end when OP goes to sleep. 

* If we have enough coverage teams, we can be ready to cover the next big breaking news event, whatever that may be. I’d like to see more [Live Threads]. Wouldn’t you? 

P.S., [This is me whenever I see a new Live Thread.](http://i.imgur.com/WiW9W.gif)

****
If you’re like me, and you want to make this **happen**, then I’m sure you’re asking the question: **How do we do this?**

* In short, we will have to work together. So let’s make this happen. 


****
**If you want to join/lead a NewsCrowd Team, and you have a topic in mind, here's what you can do:**

To begin planning your NewsCrowd Team, please contact the /r/NewsCrowd moderator team with a message containing the following information:

1. Any expertise that might relate to your desired area of coverage (No expertise is necessarily required. In most cases, all that is necessary is a keen interest in some newsworthy subject)
	
2. Your desired area(s) of coverage
	
3. Your desired role (Team leader or team member)

****
Once you have contacted us, we will get back to you with the information you need to start organizing your team, and planning your coverage. 

A private, invite only subreddit has been set up to facilitate behind-the-scenes collaboration between team members. Team leaders will be responsible for inviting their team members to the subreddit, and for coordinating their team’s coverage, to the best of their ability, given reasonable constraints. 
****
Our first team, assembled in total secrecy, is working on our first NewsCrowd Teams project as we speak. Expect to hear more about it as June approaches. That's the only hint I can give for now. ;)

****

If you have any questions, or if you would like to express your interest in this project, please PM the /r/NewsCrowd moderator team, or DM /u/NewsCrowd.

Thank you!

* **The Story So Far:**
****

* **The Mirror** 

&gt;The FBI was last night hunting a 12-strong terrorist “sleeper cell” linked to the Boston marathon bomb brothers.

&gt;Police believe Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were specially trained to carry out the devastating attack.

&gt;More than 1,000 FBI agents were last night working to track down the cell and arrested a man and two women 60 miles from Boston in the hours before Dzhokhar’s dramatic capture after a bloody shootout on Friday.

&gt;A source close to the investigation said: “We have no doubt the brothers were not acting alone. The devices used to detonate the two bombs were highly sophisticated and not the kind of thing people learn from Google.

&gt;“They were too advanced. Someone gave the brothers the skills and it is now our job to find out just who they were. Agents think the sleeper cell has up to a dozen members and has been waiting several years for their day to come.”

&gt;A specialist team of CIA and FBI interrogators was yesterday flown to a Boston hospital to grill wounded Dzhokhar, 19, about the secret group. The University of Massachusetts student was caught on Friday after hiding out in a boat parked in a garden in locked down Watertown the day after a gun battle with police left his 26-year-old brother and a rookie cop dead.

&gt;Two Russian speaking men in their early 20s later arrived at the apartment and told reporters they were journalists from the Boston Globe. They then entered the apartment through an unlocked patio door. When asked what they were doing they said: ‘We are friends of theirs. They are talking, they are talking’ and closed the door. When MailOnline rang the City desk of the Boston Globe, a man said: ‘We’re very busy right now. Consider us informed’.

&gt;A source close to Hezbollah told AFP on Thursday that over 75 Hezbollah fighters had been killed in Syria while fighting alongside the regime forces.

&gt;According to the source, 57 of the Hezbollah fighters were killed in battle, and an additional 18 succumbed to their wounds after being involved in clashes, mainly in the rebel-held town Qusayr.

**[Al-Arabiya]**

&gt;Lebanese supporters and opponents of Syrian President Bashar Assad fired heavy machine guns and lobbed mortar shells at each other Thursday in some of the worst fighting in the port city of Tripoli in years.

&gt;The battles raised the five-day death toll to 16 and fed fears of the Syrian civil war spreading to Lebanon and other neighboring countries.

&gt;Lebanon has been on edge since the uprising in Syria began in March 2011. The country, which is still struggling to recover from its own 15-year civil war, is sharply divided along sectarian lines and into pro and anti-Assad camps. The overt involvement by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah Shiite militant group alongside Assad's regime has sparked outrage among many Sunnis in Lebanon who identify with the overwhelmingly Sunni rebels fighting to topple Assad.

&gt;Deadly sectarian street fighting has erupted on several occasions, mostly in Tripoli, Lebanon's largest city and a hotbed for Sunni Islamists. This week's fighting there has been linked to a Syrian regime offensive against the rebel-held city of Qusayr in western Syria that has included Hezbollah fighters supporting Syrian troops against the rebels.

&gt;Tripoli is overwhelmingly Sunni but has a tiny community of Alawites, members of Assad's minority sect, which is an offshoot of Shiite Islam.

&gt;Residents reported more than six hours of fighting that began late Wednesday and continued through Thursday morning. Mortar shells were used for the first time. Ambulances rushed back and forth, transporting casualties to hospitals as officials used mosque loudspeakers to urge citizens to take shelter in basements. Schools and many businesses were shuttered Thursday as sporadic fighting continued.

&gt;Five people were killed, pushing the overall death toll to 16 since fighting began Sunday, with 200 people wounded, a security official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with military regulations.

&gt;Turkey is constructing2.5-km-long (1.5 mile) twin walls at a border crossing with Syria to increase security at the frontier following three deadly bombings this year.

&gt;The concrete walls will be built on either side of the road leading from the Turkish side of the crossing at Cilvegozu tothe Syrian border gate and will be topped with barbed wire, the Turkish Customs Ministry said in a statement.

&gt;Cilvegozu was the scene of a bombing in February which killed 14 people and this month 51 people died when twin car bombs ripped through the nearby town of Reyhanli.

&gt;Since July, Turkish vehicles have not been allowed to cross at the Cilvegozu gate for security reasons, but it has remained open to allow in Syrian refugees and for humanitarian aid from Turkey to be carried across.

&gt;Approved Turkish vehicles are currently allowed into the unoccupied buffer area between the Turkish and Syrian gates to unload goods before turning back.

&gt;The Bab al-Hawa gate on the Syrian side fell under the control of rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last year. February's bomb struck inside the buffer area very close to the Turkish gate.

&gt;Vehicle screening equipment and x-ray machines as well as wire fencing and extra lighting and security cameras will also be installed, the ministry said.

&gt;Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan will visit Reyhanli on Saturday, the first time since the bombings.

&gt;The regime of Syrian President Bashar al Assad has agreed ""in principle"" to attend international talks on the crisis planned for June in Geneva, Russia said Friday. Representatives of Syria's rebel opposition are also expected to attend.

&gt;Syria's most powerful ally Russia said Friday that the Damascus regime had agreed ""in principle"" to attend an international peace conference on the crisis that world powers hope will take place in Geneva in June.

&gt;But Moscow also criticised Syria's various opposition groups for presenting tough demands that in some cases included the exclusion of President Bashar al-Assad's representatives from the negotiations.

&gt;Russian foreign ministry spokesman Alexander Lukashevich said Russia had received the Damascus government's agreement to take part in the Geneva conference during a visit to Moscow by Syria's Deputy Foreign Minister Faisal Muqdad.

&gt;""We note with satisfaction that we have received an agreement in principle from Damascus to attend the international conference in the interest of the Syrians themselves finding a political path to resolve the conflict,"" Lukashevich told reporters.

&gt;The United States expressed concern Friday that Lebanon could find itself dragged into Syria's civil war and expressed support for efforts by the country's army to halt an outbreak of fighting.

&gt;""The United States is deeply concerned about the situation in Lebanon,"" State Department deputy spokesman Patrick Ventrell said.

&gt;Clashes have erupted in the northern Lebanese port of Tripoli between two armed factions, one sympathetic to Bashar al-Assad's Syrian government and the other to the rebels fighting for his removal.

&gt;Meanwhile, Lebanese Hezbollah fighters have crossed the border into Syria in order to support Assad's forces battling to control frontier communities.

&gt;""The United States fully supports Lebanon's security, stability, and sovereignty and welcomes efforts by Lebanon's leaders to take all necessary steps to put an end to the violence"" Ventrell said.

&gt;""The latest clashes in the northern city of Tripoli, in which at least 23 people have been killed, constitute a stark reminder that the conflict in Syria poses an increasingly dangerous threat to Lebanon's stability and security.

&gt;""We call on all parties in the region to avoid any actions that would exacerbate that crisis, increase the propensity for spillover violence, and negatively affect civilian populations.""

**[BBC]**

&gt;There has been an upsurge in fighting in the strategic Syrian town of Qusair, both sides in the conflict say.

&gt;The army, which began an offensive to recapture Qusair last Sunday, says it has now launched a three-pronged attack on the rebel-held town.

&gt;The rebels say they are under heavy bombardment from Lebanese Hezbollah militants, who back Syria's government.

&gt;The fighting in Qusair, a strategically important town between Homs and the Lebanese border, intensified early on Saturday.

&gt;The town was hit by heavy bombardments, including two ground-to-ground missiles and an air strike as well as artillery and rocket fire, activists say.

&gt;They say Hezbollah fighters, who are widely reported to have played a major role in the attack on Sunday, were trying to advance again.

&gt;Syrian state media said the army had launched a three-pronged offensive in the north, centre and south of the town, and was making big advances, killing many rebel fighters.

&gt;However the official media made no mention of the part played by Hezbollah.

&gt;The Lebanese group is also known to have lost a number of fighters in Qusair, prompting Lebanese President Michel Suleiman to warn the Shia militia against getting ""bogged down in the sands of discord"".

**[CBS News]**

&gt;A friend of Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev implicated himself and Tsarnaev in an unsolved triple homicide before authorities say he instigated a violent confrontation that resulted in his death early Wednesday morning, CBS News correspondent Bob Orr reports.

&gt;Law enforcement sources told Orr that the man, a Chechen identified as Ibragim Todashev, implicated himself and Tsarnaev to authorities in the 2011 killings in Waltham, Mass., under questioning Wednesday at Todashev's apartment in Orlando, Fla.

&gt;Authorities went to the apartment after having obtained what the sources described as strong evidence to suggest that Todashev, Tsarnaev and his brother Dzhokhar were involved in the killings on the tenth anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The FBI had already interviewed Todashev more than once before Wednesday

**[AP]**

&gt;Officials say a Chechen immigrant who was being questioned about his ties to one of the Boston Marathon bombing suspects was shot to death after a violent confrontation with an FBI agent.

&gt;Three law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said earlier Wednesday that Ibragim Todashev lunged at the FBI agent with a knife before he was shot. However, two of those officials said later Wednesday it was no longer clear whether Todashev lunged at the agent with a knife. The third had not received any new information since earlier in the day.

&gt;he FBI has publicly characterized the incident as a violent confrontation, providing no other details of what happened inside a townhouse in Orlando, Fla., before Todashev was shot.

**[ABC]**

&gt;The man shot dead by an FBI agent in Orlando, Florida early today was ""about to sign a statement"" admitting to a role, along with Boston Marathon bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev, in an unsolved triple murder in Massachusetts in 2011, two people with direct knowledge of the case told ABC News.

&gt;Ibragim Todashev ""just went crazy,"" and pulled a knife during his interview with the FBI, said state and federal law enforcement officials briefed on the latest strange twist in the investigation of the Boston Marathon bombing.

&gt;One official said an FBI agent was stabbed several times, although his injuries were described by the FBI as ""non-life threatening.""

1366627821.0,6,self.NewsCrowd,1cuuhn,Brainstorming Thread: NewsCrowd going forward,JustSmokedOne,8,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewsCrowd/comments/1cuuhn/brainstorming_thread_newscrowd_going_forward/,"Hi everybody. The entire idea behind /r/NewsCrowd is to replicate the best aspects of the sort of crowd-sourced news reporting that we saw during the week of the Boston Marathon Bombing. 

Between the Live Update threads in the new, but somewhat general /r/inthenews, and the REALLY live update threads over in /r/ScannerPorn,  something amazing and unprecedented was happening. Revolutionary even. Reddit way way ahead on the story in Watertown.

We want to reach out to the community and get your input.

1. **What did reddit do right?**

2. We should try and identify 'best practices'. 

3. If we were to begin to compile an open database of news sources, what would the best way of doing this be?

4. Can we be prepared to cover major news evens even faster than last time? What can we do to prepare for the next big story?





5. **What did reddit do wrong?**

6. Obviously posting the details of officer movements needs to be kept to a minimum during some situations. What else can we do to ensure that we are not damaging active investigations, while still managing to effectively share useful information? 

7. I think we are all aware of the situation with the fellow who I will not name here out of respect. We definitely want to avoid trying to tie online profiles to FBI pictures in full public view. If you see something, pass it on to the FBI. Don't post it on reddit. I don't think we need to rehash this debate here. That being said, if you have any ideas for how to avoid such things from happening, we should definitely consider our options. 

9. How interested are users here in a news subreddit that delivers **all of the information**, as it emerges, in such a way so that the user can make her or his own mind about the story? That happened to an extent during the past week. I saw a lot of really interesting debates, and a lot of critical thinking from reddit. I saw something glorious. Do you think we can do this again?

10. Do you have any other thoughts to share about crowd-sourcing news coverage? I wish I had more thoughtful and insightful comments to make. I guess I will just reiterate how much amazed I was by some of the incredible reporting I was seeing by redditors. Crowd-sourced news is the future. But that's just like, my opinion, man. Please share your perspective!",,False,,t5_2x02z,False,,,True,t3_1cuuhn,http://www.reddit.com/r/NewsCrowd/comments/1cuuhn/brainstorming_thread_newscrowd_going_forward/,

****


1. Try to make sure the links are recent, reliable, and informative. We do not want to be spreaders of gossip. If a source is unverified, please indicate as such if you decide to share it. Please use your best judgement when deciding whether to share unverified reports.

2. Please introduce sourcing in your posts, especially when you are posting information general audiences may be unfamiliar with. If you are using information gathered from a Twitter user, please indicate why that user ought to be considered a valid and reliable source. With U.S. news stories, it's a lot easier to verify the veracity of eyewitness reports than it would be if we were trying to verify the veracity of a source from, oh, lets say, China. For this reason, do your best to identify the veracity of social media news sources.

3. Keep all discussions civilized. 

4. Personal attacks will not be tolerated. Unnecessarily vulgar language is strongly discouraged, and posts that are found to contain such language may be removed at the discretion of moderators. Trolls, memes, pop-culture references, and jokes are not permitted.

4. Moderators can delete posts and ban users at their own discretion. 

5. All Meta discussions should be kept to /r/MetaNewsCrowd, unless otherwise specified by a NewsCrowd mod, such as would be the case if user input was directly requested. Meta discussions would include, for example, any discussion of the community's rules and expectations. Please keep that sort of thing in /r/MetaNewsCrowd.

Thank you in advance for your compliance. We will do our best to ensure our moderation is fair and transparent.

We've been planning /r/PoliticsCrowd for a while, but recent events in Washington forced us to reevaluate our roll-out schedule for this sub.

We don't want you to miss what's happening in the world, and having a separate sub for political news will help to ensure that NewsCrowd can continue to focus on major national and international news events. 

At the same time, we don't want to neglect political news. PoliticsCrowd can focus on the nitty-gritty of American politics.

**[CNN]**

&gt;At Wednesday's daily briefing, White House press secretary Jay Carney said Obama is ""considering a range of options"" to reduce the prison's population. Senior officials say there is a focus on repatriating and transferring detainees.

&gt;""I would say that one of the options is reappointing a senior official at the State Department to renew our focus on repatriating or transferring those detainees,"" Carney said.
""We're in the process of working on that now; we're looking at candidates"" who could lead the process of helping close Guantanamo, Attorney General Eric Holder said this month. 

&gt;""The president has indicated that it's too expensive, that it's a recruitment tool for terrorists, it has a negative impact on our relationship with our allies, and so we're going to make a renewed effort to close Guantanamo.""

&gt;But with more than half the facility's inmates engaging in various forms of hunger strike, more than 20 of them being force-fed, the failure to close the facility established in 2001 is a continuing problem for the administration.

&gt;There are 86 inmates at Guantanamo who have been cleared for transfer, 56 of them from Yemen.

**[Reuters]**

&gt;Obama was to say that the United States will only use drone strikes when a threat is imminent, a nuanced change from the previous policy of launching strikes against a significant threat.

&gt;Under a new presidential guidance signed recently, Obama will say the Defense Department will take the lead in launching drones, as opposed to the current practice of the CIA taking charge.

&gt;And any drone strike will only be launched when a terrorism suspect cannot be captured. The United States will respect state sovereignty and will limit strikes to al Qaeda or associated targets, according to senior administration officials who briefed reporters ahead of the speech.

&gt;""Importantly before any strike is taken, there must be a near certainty that no civilians will be killed or injured in the strike,"" a senior official said.

&gt;The use by the United States of armed drone aircraft to attack extremists has increased tensions with countries such as Pakistan and drawn criticism from human rights activists. He said earlier this year he wanted to be more open about the issue.

&gt;The largely Sunni neighbourhood of Bab al-Tabbaneh supports Syria's predominantly Sunni rebels, and the adjacent Alawite neighbourhood of Jabal Mohsen supports Syrian President Bashar Assad.

&gt;The army is returning fire, and has been raiding certain areas since the morning.

&gt;Schools and the majority of shops are closed, but the rest of main Tripoli is operating as normal. 

&gt;As of yesterday, two people were reported dead and more than 40 wounded.

&gt;Lebanese soldiers were seen in the area, with troops in armoured personnel carriers opening fire with heavy machine guns at unseen targets.

&gt;The clashes broke out on Sunday in the afternoon.

&gt;KHQ has a crew on scene in Browne's Addition where we are told a warrant is being served nearby and it is related to ricin-tainted letters sent earlier this week. They were postmarked May 14th. One was addressed to a Federal judge in Spokane, the other to the Postal Union.

&gt;Spokane Police said Saturday morning, ""The FBI, US Postal Inspection Service and the SPD are executing a search warrant in connection with the threatening letters intercepted Tuesday at a U.S. Postal Service facility in Spokane.""

**[15:24 GMT/UTC]**

&gt;Spokane Police are in Browne's Addition Saturday morning conducting operations in conjunction with the investigation into two letters that preliminarily tested positive for Ricin found at the Spokane Post Office earlier this week.

&gt;The law enforcement action is happening at 1st and Oak in Browne's Addition, where police and a HazMat team are participating in law enforcement action. It's not known yet if any persons are in custody or what led the investigation to Browne's Addition.

&gt;Two letters arrived at the post office earlier this week that tested positive for Ricin, a highly toxic substance made from Castor beans that has no known cure. A very small amount of Ricin -- 500 micrograms -- can kill a person.

&gt;The FBI confirmed earlier this week it was assisting in the investigation; its not known yet if it was participating in the law enforcement action in Browne's Addition.

&gt;A Washington National Guard unit, the 10th Civil Support Team, whose mission it is to investigation weapons of mass destruction, was deployed to Spokane after the discovery of the letters to also aid in identifying whether or not Ricin was found in those letters.

&gt;A news release posted to the American Postal Workers Union website earlier this week said two letters addressed to the Spokane Post Office and a federal judge were postmarked May 13 and arrived at the post office on May 14. Both preliminarily tested positive for Ricin.

&gt;The APWU website report stated ""they have no reason to believe that any employees are at risk from handling the suspect letters as they passed through the mailstream in Spokane.""
