1. Apply hair conditioner
2. Rinse

Sorry to gross everyone out this morning, or if this is the wrong forum, but after dealing with this every week or two since puberty and finding an easy fix, I feel the need to shout from the rooftops. 

For those of you who are like ""Wha?"", under the right (wrong?) conditions, usually after rubbing one out and falling asleep, I would develop a fish-like smell downtown. It's not the sort of thing (to the best of my knowledge) that anyone not intimately involved with my genitalia would notice, but sometimes I, you know, want someone to be intimately involved. No amount of soaping or scrubbing (or, as I also experimented, just rinsing) would make it go away. It usually lasted a day or two. Having been a 20-year-old virgin, I'm confident that it wasn't due to some kind of STI. 

It seems to basically come down to pH. Both sexy time fluids and soap raise the pH on the surface of your skin, which seems to (under the right dark, warm and/or moist conditions) facilitate the growth of whatever microbe is responsible for the fishy smell. 

I remembered reading somewhere that hair conditioner is designed to correct the pH of your hair (for different reasons), and at some point in the last year had a Eureka moment and decided to try it. Anyway, it worked like magic, so give it a try if you happen to share my problem. 

EDIT: I wasn't sure if this would go anywhere, but it looks like I struck a nerve. A couple of notes: 

Yes, this is more of an issue for uncut guys, but seems to afflict most guys from time to time. 

Also, I didn't mean to imply that you shouldn't wash first. This is for when soap-and-water washing doesn't do the trick or just makes things worse. ",,True,nsfw,t5_2s4uu,True,,,True,t3_s6e5s,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/s6e5s/cure_for_fishy_junk/,

They aren't selling to you because you aren't a tool douche bag.  Forget about girls saying ""oh, i like the smell of axe body spray.""  They haven't smelled you yet. Or the new you after I'm done with you, rather.  After they do, their taste will either be more refined or you'll make them feel terrible for liking that stuff.  

It's really simple:  First, **unscented everything.**  Unscented body wash/soap (dove makes some, as do a bunch of companies.)  Unscented deodorant (mitchum, Arm + Hammer, etc.) Lighter scented shampoo.  No body spray.  No after shave unless it's an unscented facial moisturizer (kiehl's makes some good ones.)  

Then, you go spend some cash on some goddamn colognes.  You'll need at least two: fresher day time scents (something blue and sporty) and classy night time scents (something green or otherwise dark.)  Since you don't smell like anything else, your one or two spritzes of cologne are going to impress people who catch small, light ""walking past"" whiffs and girls (or guys) who get close to you.  Remember your smell isn't a long range tractor beam.  It's an aura that should reward the girl (or guy) you've sweet talked enough to come in a little closer.

I'm not saying you need to use both cologne types i've recommended in a day. Or even use either one every day.  If you aren't going to be around anyone you need to impress, don't use a scent!  Scent-free is better than axe or old spice...too many men are casualties in these companies' douche-smell arms race.  Think of it this way:  everything in the bathroom has a purpose. Body wash washes oil and dirt off of you.  Shampoo cleans your hair. Aftershave moisturizes.  Cologne provides your scent!  Don't mix it all together.  Keep that division of labor going.  Don't trust the body wash to give you a good smell, just like you wouldn't trust the butcher to give you a hair cut.

I hope this helps.  As for buying colognes, go to one of those classier department stores like Nordstrom's or whatever, and go to their cologne counter.  The people there are paid to help you find a good scent.  Then go to basenotes (see this reddit's sidebar) and find a reputable (counterfeit cologne is a problem) online retailer for a cheaper price.

I am a fairly hairy guy and never really took care of grooming in my life. Grooming history: I would often have to shave facial hair and occasionally, I shave my lower back due to a birth mark creating a rather hairy and disgusting situation there. lastly, I exclusively use a razor to shave because I don't know any better

Lack of Grooming history: however, I have left the rest of my body wild and hairy for some years. I have been quite embarrassed about this for some time and never did anything about it. I recently found this subreddit and thought a perfect time for learn and gain some confidence in myself. 

Thus, I have a lot of questions:

1) What does [/r/malegrooming](/r/malegrooming) recommend as a body shaver since I have experience only in razors? (especially if one need to shave parts like armpits, ass, and groin?) 

2) Should I leave parts unshaven? I seem posts about chest hair and how you should not be embarrassed about it. Does the same go for armpits? legs? 

3) How does one go about shaving parts like armpits, ass, groin? Should I completely shave it (armpits, groin, ass)? Trim it (same parts)? I am thinking about only trimming ""downtown"" areas, but how much should I trim off? Being a fairly hairy guy, I am afraid of trimming too much and it looking odd compare to the rest of my body. 

4)* How much should I shave/trim and the other half leave alone due to a natural hairy body?

5) I have back hair....should I get it professionally waxed or is there another way?

TL;DR - a fairly hairy and embarrassed guy trying to get a beginner's guide to male grooming and to trim his wild and hairy body. 

I did not know if this garnishes a NSFW tag, but just protecting my butt if it does. 

edit: I added questions


**Edit 2: I really thank everyone who comment on this. I think I have a better understand and a good jumping off point now! I appreciate everyone comments especially ones that say I should respect myself more. I have my game plan and ready to start trimming and experimenting.

I'd like to make some formulations for Redditors, simple effective ingredients without all the marketing and filler. No fragrances, no ""magical"" ingredients that don't really work. Just things that are tried and researched to be effective.

My current idea is to do a cleanser, exfoliating water, UV/antioxidant water, heavy moisturizer and a light moisturizer (these are products i formulated for personal use...and friends and family [because they steal them *sigh*]).

Depression most certainly is the key here, so we will be taking some steps to remedy that. Since I was finally honest about how much it really bothers me, and that it is actually affecting my attraction to him, he plans to make several changes and listen to my advice on products and the like. (He was convincing himself it wasn't, and frankly so was I.)

Thank you for the advice, everyone. 

----------------------------------

Everything else in our relationship is near perfect. We've been dating for several years now, though, and he appears to be caring less about his appearance. It's gotten to a point where I hardly find anything about him attractive, physically.

I've tried to talk to him gently about it, telling him it bugs me when he doesn't shave properly, or refuses to get hair cuts (although when his hair gets longer it seriously makes him look like he's balding). He refuses to use shampoo or conditioner, which makes his hair frizzy and damaged.. I've tried buying them for him since he says he doesn't know what to get, but that doesn't seem to matter.

He won't use any sorts of lotions or anything (because ""it's gay/girly""), which wouldn't be an issue if he didn't get horribly dry skin on his face that flakes, and gets patchy.

He's also gaining quite a bit of weight, which isn't helping either.. (I'm not petty, I don't need a guy to be super in shape or anything, but this is becoming a bit much. He has acknowledged this as an issue, but won't change it either.)

I was tempted to post this into AskReddit, but I thought I'd try here first. It seems that a lot of guys here are new to this, and maybe have had similar issues or could relate to him.

Please help? Any ideas on how to approach this?

Edit: Thank you very much, everyone. I am going to speak with him about this, and I believe depression may be the underlying issue. If I talk with him about the depression being a problem, and a concern of mine, then I can casually explain that his lack of grooming is going along with it. This way I hope it won't sound to him like ""You're disgusting, and ugly, and don't touch me.""

I have always had issues with my appearance. I was overweight for a large majority of my life, and add in the ridiculous amount of back hair I was getting at a young age and my self confidence had never been lower.

I have recently lost about 70 pounds, and I am getting to a point where I am almost proud, and not ashamed of how I look.

My problem is.. The hair still affects my confidence. I can't wear tank tops or basketball jerseys because of the amount of hair on my upper arms (delt/tri/high bicep)

The chest hair doesn't bother me THAT much, but the arm/lower back / upper back hair makes me sad.

Below are a few pics of my before/after/and the hair.

I was wondering what your opinions on it were.

I  am pretty sure waxing is out of the question, so it comes down to laser, one of those chemical nair/veet type products, shaving it (which I hear can be annoying) , or just leaving it as is.

I would appreciate any and all input.

Thanks

1. [Chris Evans:](http://i.imgur.com/pr1LN.jpg) Notice his low, very straight beard line that also drops down before his lips. It has almost no curve to it, but it works. Maybe this is because his face is less contoured?
2. [Ryan Reynolds:](http://i.imgur.com/Li9Am.jpg) Very angular beard. It goes straight out, then down toward his chin at a 45 degree angle. It looks great, but I'm wondering if that has more to do with the fact that he's Ryan Reynolds than it has to do with a good beard style. Reynolds has a flat, less contoured face, so maybe he'd be better off with a more straight beard line, like Chris Evans'?
3. [Johnny Depp:](http://i.imgur.com/blaJV.jpg) He doesn't have the natural hair to create this, but it seems like the best kind of beard for him would accentuate the contours of his natural face, hugging his cheek line and dropping prematurely before his lips - forming a vertical ""S"".
4. [Jason Statham:](http://i.imgur.com/zuHU0.jpg) Straight beard line, no drop off at all. It hugs the bottom of his cheek bones.
5. [Jake Gyllenhaal:](http://i.imgur.com/e2iVM.jpg) Another less contoured face paired with a straight beard line.

I saw a comment in some unrelated subreddit. I don't even remember what the thread was about, but someone piped in saying they switched to baby oil instead of gold bond or other related products.  

I have been getting my downstairs waxed for the last year or so, and it was more important to keep it all dry and fresh. I tried baby oil, and haven't powdered since. It keeps you perfectly fresh, everything feels natural instead of extra dry, and it is good for your skin instead of damaging. I have recently switched over to coconut oil instead of baby oil, but either one will work great. Baby oil is probably easier to start with getting the right amount.

Start with only a drop or two, right out of the shower while you are still damp. It is easy to add more, it is harder to de-oil yourself if you get too much on. :)  You don't need much, a very very thin coat rubbed in pretty well will suffice. You shouldn't feel particularly oily, but even if you do it will fade pretty quickly.

Give it a try, easy enough to switch back if you don't like it.

I've been craving an order in which to do my daily hygienic activities and I'm sure I'm not alone, so I felt like I needed to share this.

FOR STARTERS:

1. The first thing you need to do when you wake up is to drink a cup of water, and then rinse your mouth with water.

2. After putting toothpaste on your brush, brush each tooth, especially along the gumline, as well as the backsides, lightly on the inner cheeks and tongue. (Clench your non-dominant hand to prevent gagging). Preferably use an electric toothbrush, you should brush from 1:30-2:00 minutes.

3. Floss between gaps and around teeth.

4. Mouthwash for 90 seconds, gargle and spit. Rinse your mouth with water or get a sick stomach. 

SHOWER:

5. Now it's time to shower! If you brush in the shower, that's fine too. Rinse hair, shampoo, rinse, conditioner (optional).

6. Put your soap/body wash into a wash cloth and wash your chest, arms, underarms, back, lower-body (ahem), legs, and feet last. Soap that cloth up again and rinse it. 

7. Dry off your body first from your face to your legs, but wait before drying your nether regions and between your toes. Dry from your face down your legs, then your hair, then your nether region, THEN between the toes. Feet should be the last things you dry.

SHAVING:

8. Now is the perfect time to shave. Use a facial scrub and then put on the foam. Shave, then put on a moisturizer. Every two days you should exfoliate AFTER you shave, THEN put on the moisturizer, eye cream (vaseline works great), and lip balm. 

MISC:

9. Clean your ears with Q-tips. It's disgustingly awesome how much better and cleaner I can feel and hear after doing so. (Yes, this has risk of being counter-productive and even damaging. Hydrogen Peroxide works better and is safer, but Q-tips in a clockwise/counter clockwise fashion while not entering deeply into the ear canal works fine).

10. Put on your anti-perspirant. In my experience, body sprays are terrible and they do nothing. They don't even smell all that great. I'm a Gillette man, and while gel isn't for everyone, it works great for me and my girlfriend goes crazy for it. 

Products I use:

Oral-B toothbrush, Crest Pro-Health Whitening/Mouthwash, Orbit White after all said and done, American Crew volumizing shampoo when short, Head and Shoulders Sport when long, Gillette moisturizing body wash when ordinary, Bath and Body Works Oak when fancy, Gillette Pro-Glide power with warming facial scrub, clear shave gel, and cooling moisturizer, microbial Q-tips, vaseline, burt's bees, and Gillette cool-wave anti-perspirant. 

*EDIT* Boy, some things I didn't think through. Changed the order of some parts because reasons.

I'd like to start maybe a bi-weekly or monthly thing on malegrooming...

I'd like you to submit product names and I'll take a look at the marketing and see if the ingredients justify the claims...I'd like to do about 10 each edition

For example:

Dove's VisibleCare Renewing Creme Body Wash - $7.25, $0.32/oz on Amazon.com

http://www.dove.ca/en/Products/Body-Wash/Dove-VisibleCareTM-Renewing-Creme-Body-Wash.aspx

Designed to nourish and replenish skin, this unique formula – with our highest concentration of NutriumMoisture® – contains skin natural moisturizers, the building blocks to help improve skin’s look over time. Use daily for softer, smoother skin in one week.

The ingredients: Aqua, Glycerin, Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Stearic Acid, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Lauric Acid, Tallow Acid or/ou Palmitic Acid, Sodium Isethionate, Parfum, Sodium Chloride, DMDM Hydantoin,Disodium EDTA, Methylisothiazolinone, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate

The reality: This body wash contains only one moisturizer, glycerin. Glycerin is a water soluble humectant, meaning it binds to skin and absorbs moisture from the surrounding atmosphere. Because it's in a body wash it's not likely a significant amount will bind to your skin. 

Beyond that this is a very generic and basic soap. 

The rest of the ingredients are foaming agents (Sodium Lauroyl Isethionate, Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Cocamidopropyl Betaine, Sodium Isethionate)

Thickeners and emulsifiers (Stearic Acid, Lauric Acid, Tallow Acid or/ou Palmitic Acid)

and preservatives (DMDM Hydantoin,Disodium EDTA, Methylisothiazolinone, Iodopropynyl Butylcarbamate)

So it seems glycerin is the magic ""NutriumMoisture"" compound, and unless these ""building blocks"" include water, there's absolutely nothing special about this product. You can buy glycerin at the drug store for around 10 bucks a litre, mix it into a 10% solution and spray it on to your body for better results!",,False,self,t5_2s4uu,False,,,True,t3_nqciq,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/nqciq/mismatch_edition_1_does_the_skin_care_ingredients/,

1343419906.0,28,self.malegrooming,x9jhx,How I Conquered Folliculitis (Backne),groomdude,34,6,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/x9jhx/how_i_conquered_folliculitis_backne/,"For years I have struggled with my self-confidence about the skin on my back. Many years ago when I was in middle school, I noticed the skin on my back was starting to get little pimples here and there. It wasn't until high school when it got really troublesome. All over my back, my shoulders, down my arms up til my elbows. It wasn't HORRIBLE, but the blotches, spots, cysts, and redness here and there destroyed my self-confidence. For years, I dreaded swimming in fear that people would see and judge. I know people who had it worse and I know a lot of people (guys/girls) struggle with it just like facial acne, It wasn't until recent months when I decided that I needed to take steps to combat it that it actually started going away. I don't have any pictures, but for the most part it is gone and got MUCH better. Here is my advice:

1) General: Essentially, a lot of the maintenance you do for your face applies to your back/body, which will become evident in the advice. You need to resist the urges to pick, scratch, pop, etc. Try to keep that skin CLEAN and free from more irritation.

2) Linens/Clothes: Make sure everything you spend the day in/wrap yourself in is clean. Yes, change your towels every 1-2 days, sheets on your bed should be changed at most every two weeks. This goes for your pillow case. For your clothes, I personally have always worn white cotton undershirts and looking back, this was a great preventative step. They were always clean until I got sweaty or slept in them. Wear a clean shirt in the day time and CHANGE YOUR SHIRT into something clean to sleep in. You sweat when you sleep so, yes, opt for an old cotton t-shirt. Don't ask me about which fabrics, I always wear cotton t-shirts or undershirts and it did the trick. If you are sweating throughout the day/applying sunscreen/etc. change your shirt midday and maybe shower to clean off.

3) Shower: Hot water opens your pores. I think this was a MAJOR contributor to why my folliculitis lingered; I took long, hot showers. Stick to warm-cold showers. Better for your health anyways. It'll take time to get used to it, but eventually it's comfortable.

4) Sun exposure: I live in an area where it gets really hot and sunny in the spring/summer, but we have harsh winters/autumns with little reason to spend time outside. Use that sun time to your advantage and fry your back up a little. The UV Rays do something scientific and kill the bacteria. I used to know exactly what, but I can't be bothered. If you can, try to get a little safe tan going once a week, it'll help a lot.

5) Products/Meds: I actually did go to the derm once I hit high school and he diagnosed my folliculitis. He put me on some Benzoyl Peroxide (BP) cream and wash stuff for the shower along with some doxycycline. In retrospect, it was probably not a good move to get medication and here is why: The cream/wash stuff helps a little, probably not worth the money so I stopped after one refill cause it's tedious as well. The doxycycline makes it a lot more manageable and also clears your face up which for me was nice and I almost never had pimples. The problem was, was doxycycline makes you VERY vulnerable to the sun's rays and after being on a medium dose of it for years, i got burnt easy and my face always looked red. I probably developed some rosacea or something from it. Look into it and talk to a doctor. As for products, a small tube of BP can be applied to spots before you sleep and they'll generally help keep big whiteheads down. I kept a cleanser in the shower and used it every other day. It helps, but can dry your skin out. I found a great Clean &amp; Clear moisturizer that also has salicylic acid in it and would put that on after I (cold!) shower. I saw improvement quickly. Try to use them every other day, though as you will blow through them quickly, but you can also dry your skin out quickly. I recommend some lotion (I used some ""repairing"" vaseline lotion) and apply it over your back/body 1-2 times a day. Just doing that alone actually cleared up my arms a great deal.

6) Water. Drink a lot of it. Aim for half your body weight in fluid ounces. It helps not only your skin, but other things in your body as well. Makes you feel good.

Well, I struggled with it for about 5 years and little progress was made besides the dermatologist stuff. I took the actions above and it has gotten visibly much, much better in only about 4 months. You don't have to go to the doctor and in my case it proved a waste of time/money. I think it's a good idea for everyone to be drinking lots of water, but if you are on a tight budget and want to conquer the folliculitis yourself I recommend at the very least taking cold showers, drinking a lot of water, changing your shirts, and using lotion. Those alone I think helped ~50%. Persistence is key! I hope this guide helps and I'd be willing to answer any PM's or replies. Thanks for reading!

1335319237.0,26,self.malegrooming,sr1cs,How to Nair your balls.,forbidden_arts,31,5,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/sr1cs/how_to_nair_your_balls/,"I see a lot of posts about getting your coin-purse squeaky clean, and gents, I’m here to tell you it can be done. I’ve been Nairing my sack for the last twelve years, only had one bad experience, which you can avoid. Sorry about the length, wanted to make it thorough.

Before we get started, couple things:

* I am not a doctor - please don’t consider this medical advice, and sue me.

* You need to do this on an “off” day. If you have a hot date tonight with anyone but your hand, it’s probably not a good idea.

* Veet is much better, and less caustic, though not as widely available.

* If you are super-concerned about your “sensitive skin” put a dob on a spot in your armpit and give it a test run.

Ok, so here we go...

* Get yourself some 3 or 4 minute lotion. I go with the “Aloe and Lanolin” version.

* Bring your smart phone or, barring that, a book. You’re going to be standing in an awkward position for 5-8 minutes.

* Do not shower beforehand.

* Do not warm up the Nair.

* Your sack needs to be dry. Like arid desert dry.

The Nair needs to go on thick, **but** you want to use as little as possible. In the winter, it’s not a big deal, but if it’s 200 degrees out, you’re going to have to cover more ground. My suggestion would be getting the air conditioner to blow directly on your sack, which will not only dry that swamp out, but reduce the surface area that you have to cover. Barring that, I guess a fan would work.
For determining the amount of Nair I use, I put the tip of my thumb adjacent to the second knuckle of my index finger. This should make a nice little cup in your **non-dominant** hand. Fill most of this with Nair.

It is important that you do it right the first time. You cannot re-Nair, or you will get a chemical burn on your junk, and I will see your video on Youtube. 

Set that bottle down and use your dominant hand to scoop up and apply the Nair. It needs to go on about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Do not rub it in - just spread it like you’re icing a cupcake. It’s not a race, take your time. I usually start in the middle and work my way to the back. The **last** spot you want to hit is the underside of your dick. This is because, by this time, you’ve exhausted the majority of your Nair, and you can use that non-dominant hand to prop your unit up so the skin isn’t overlapping and squishing out the Nair at the top of your sack.

I try to avoid getting the Nair on my legs, because it will cause a bald spot (although in my experience, your partner will be so impressed with your shiny globes that they’ll never notice). Thus, I end up standing like [this](http://www.vinow.com/podcast/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/captain_morgan.jpg) with one foot on the toilet, trying not to have my junk rub up against my leg.

Wash your hands in cold water, if possible. 

Once this is all completed, your Nair time starts. If you were able to wash your hands, you now have complete access to your phone/book, and you have at least 5 minutes to kill. Keep calm, relax. If you can stand like a flamingo for 7+ minutes without cramping, I say go for it.
Start up the shower, it needs to be cold. Not like Arctic cold, but think swimming pool, and then turn the heat down slightly. If the water is warm enough to loosen your sack up, it’s too warm. 

Hop in the shower. Ignore the soap. This is a rinse, and that soap will do awful things to you (this was my worst mistake). Gently rub the Nair off your sack; you should notice that MOST of the hair goes with it. You want to avoid stretching out your ball sack in the cold water, as this could create tiny little breaks in the skin, and will make you a Youtube star. Once you’re satisfied that you have removed 99% of it, you should be able to ever-so-slightly pull on any remaining hair, and it will come right out. I usually have to do this for the spot where my rod meets my sack.

Make sure you PAT your junk dry. There is obviously a small amount of Nair residue left on your sack, and you don’t want to grind it in. You need to hold off on taking a “real” shower for at least two hours, at which point, you can resume normal operation. 

This usually keeps my sack squeaky clean for 2 weeks, and when it starts to grow back, it comes in super soft, so you can squeeze out another week and a half before you have to repeat the ritual.

In Mis-Match, I’m going to be taking a look at a product’s ingredients and seeing whether those ingredients justify the marketing claim the company is making. You’ll learn which ingredients are doing the work in the product, which are doing harm, and hopefully it’ll help you make a decision as to whether or not a product is worth your money and time!

This week’s suggestions came from this thread on Reddit: Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser, Cetaphil Daily Facial Moisturizer SPF 15, and Kiehl’s Facial Fuel SPF 15.

Thanks to ejas4816, Indeedsir, Kandoh, Picture_me_this, demifool, and Autopack for suggestions! Sorry I wasn’t able to get to all of them. I’m going to try to pick the most widely available products and will cover more products in  time.

**Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser**

**The Claim**

Cetaphil® Gentle Skin Cleanser is great for daily makeup removal. Originally formulated for dermatologists, this cleanser is gentle on your skin and sensitive to your skin’s needs. Cetaphil® Gentle Skin Cleanser will not strip the skin of natural protective oils or emollients, or disturb the skin’s natural pH balance. This dermatologist-recommended cleanser is fragrance-free and non-comedogenic. Cetaphil® Gentle Skin Cleanser is gentle enough for children, teens and adults.

**The Ingredients**

Water, cetyl alcohol, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, stearyl alcohol, methylparaben, propylparaben, butylparaben.

(Listed in decreasing quantity)

**The Cost**

$0.63 US per fluid ounce on Amazon

**What is it?**

Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser is a cream/gel cleanser. It is made up water, solvents and surfactants, thickeners and preservatives.

Cetyl alcohol, and stearyl alcohol are components of cetearyl alcohol which is a white waxy solid. It’s what gives Cetaphil its texture and thickness, without it the product would just be a runny, white liquid.

Propylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulfate act as solvents and surfactants. Propylene glycol, a solvent helps to dilute oils on the skin, and those found in make up. It has a slippery feel on the skin and acts as a humectant, attracting moisture to the surface of the skin as well. Sodium lauryl sulfate is a standard surfactant, it binds to both water and oil. It binds to the oil on your skin, emulsifies (mixes) it with water and is then easily rinsed away with water. It’s the same surfactant that is commonly used in foaming cleansers.

Methylparaben, propylparaben and butylparaben are a group of preservatives. These ingredients reduce or stop the growth of bacteria and fungi in the product. Some people believe that use of parabens on the skin can lead to certain forms of cancer, however current research does not indicate this to be true.  Methylparaben has also been suggested to be a photosensitizer, meaning it can increase your chance of sun damage and sun burn. Parabens as preservative are used in very small amounts, however, and are extremely effective which is why they’re still used so commonly.

**The Match-Up**

“…great for daily makeup removal?” Yup! This is due to the propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate and cetearyl alcohol. They will help break up, dissolve and wipe away oil and water based makeup from the skin. Best results would be from applying the product and wiping it off with a tissue or cotton pad. However, even water and a cotton pad will remove a good percentage of the makeup, the three ingredients mentioned just help make it easier! Due to its ingredients though, you may have a trickier time removing silicone based make up.

“…gentle on your skin and sensitive to your skin’s need” Yup! Cetaphil is definitely gentle, but like any product containing propylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulfate over use can still lead to dryness of the skin. How gentle it is also is determined by how you use it, if you scrub your face hard you will irritate your skin despite how gentle the cleanser is. Some people may clean their face longer or with more gusto due to the creamy texture of Cetaphil, but rest assured that the dissolving of oils and the mechanical rubbing action is good enough to remove bacteria, oil and dirt from the skin. Foamy doesn’t always mean clean!

“…will not strip the skin of natural protective oils or emollients” Uhh. The nature of a cleanser IS to remove oils and emollients from the skin. The deposition however of the propylene glycol and cetearyl alcohol on your skin might make your skin feel more moisturized, but cleaning your face with a surfactant like sodium lauryl sulfate means that you will be removing your skin’s natural oils – it’s kind of the point!

“…will not disturb the skin’s natural pH balance.” Uhh. There are no pH modifiers in the product, like sodium bicarbonate or more commonly citric acid. Skin’s pH is around 5.5 which is slightly acidic. Sodium lauryl sulfate is an alkaline and has a pH of around 9 to 10 in a 1% solution. So unless your bottle has some sort of acid in it to lower the pH, this Cetaphil cleanser likely isn’t pH balanced. Not to worry though, your skin returns to it’s normal pH after cleansing usually within an hour.

“fragrance-free and non-comedogenic.” Yup! Definitely fragrance free. None of the ingredients in the product will clog your pores either, but some people may still be sensitive. Most comedogenic (pore clogging) tests were done on rabbits ears, which may not extrapolate to human skin though.

“gentle enough for children, teens and adults.” Yup! Though in reality everyone should be using gentle products!

**The Verdict: Match!**

Give Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser a try if you have dry or sensitive skin. Though in reality everyone can use it, some may find the cream texture displeasing and prefer a foamier cleanser. The cleanser isn’t leaps and bounds less irritating than a properly formulated foamy cleanser, it just feels that way. The reason why its less irritating is not so much the ingredients it contains, but the ingredients it doesnt – like fragrances, extracts, and dyes. You can often find cheaper generic versions of this with the exact same ingredients at the drugstore!

I live in the UK, 20 years old and looking at the mid-high price range products.

**Morning**

In the shower

- Hair  (It's really thick and really straight.)
 
 -  No name shampoo, wash in wash straight out. Probably killing my hair, but gets the styling product out. Suggestions welcome.

 - Aussie mega conditioner, put in and only rinse out at the end of the shower (so in my hair for about 10m~). I chose this one over all the others because it had a kangaroo on the front eg. I have no idea what to look for in a conditioner. If you know products that are better shout it out.

- No name shower gel for everywhere else except face, which I don't use anything on.
 - Was gonna grab Kyoku for Men Daily Facial Cleanser and Exfoliating Facial Scrub as the reviews were good. Is this something you use in the shower, is it beneficial to leave on for a time before washing off, how long does a tube last and what are some alternative products?
 - I have some spots on my back/shoulder area, would a better shower gel help prevent them or would a specific product be better? 

- I use Avene Cicalfate Repair Cream on my face straight after I get out the shower when the pores are open from the heat, leaves skin feeling really nice and reduces the number of spots/oily skin.

- What is a good general body moisturiser/other product that's good to slap on after you dry yourself of once your out the shower?

- When cleaning my teeth I use a standard whitening toothpaste, as I chipped my front teeth and the replacement is a lot whiter than the rest of them (bloody NHS dentists...). Any suggestions for teeth whitening pastes/products?

- I have (unintentionally...) got the same hair cut as [Ridiculously Photogenic Guy](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/009/754/AnBWa.jpg) and wear it kinda like that; just push it to the side and off my forehead. I use KMS California Hairplay Clay Creme, which I really like as it's quite a 'dry' product and doesn't really look like you have any product in your hair. I'm growing the fringe so I can rock a quiff, but I'm a long way off the length I need yet.

**Though-out the day**

- I've read that keeping your hands off your face is a good way to avoid getting outbreaks. I have a cheep alcohol based hand wash (just rub it into your hands without water) on my desk just in case I get something on them. Would just using this though out the day be a good way of keeping your hands cleaner and therefore not moving as much dirt to your face when they do touch? What other products are good?

**Evening**

- I've heard that washing your hair too much can be bad for it so in the shower after the gym I don't use anything on it and just give it a good scrub with my hands. Good idea, or should I use something on it?

- When I get back home, I usually use the Avene Cicalfate Repair Cream on my face again as I heard that moisturising before bed can prevent the skin from becoming oily over night. Good idea? 

- Are there any products on the market that are like the ""herb-mint facial mask"" which Patrick Beteman uses during the [morning routine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QVpRzw2eRlg#t=57) in American Psycho which you can peel off? It looks really fun!

Before I pop the pimple I clean my face with soap, and then the pimple's area with hydrogen peroxide.  I also dip the comedome extractor into a glass of hydrogen peroxide beforehand, and in between any using it on separate areas on my face. I rinse it with water after dipping it in the peroxide. (**EDIT: Hydrogen peroxide might be more irritating than helpful at killing bacteria, so I must stress washing your razor or comedome extractor with water thoroughly before having it touch your face. Also, you might not want to use peroxide on your face, as soap is usually sufficient**) 

Being sterile is key!  I try not to have too much peroxide on my face, or for too long, as it can burn the skin.  When I shave, I also dip the razor in the peroxide before and after shaving strokes (and wash in water after dipping in the peroxide).  My razor burn and pimples have cut down dramatically.

If I can, I only use the comedome extractor ONCE on the pimple. Pop once, and stop playing with it.  You don't want to keep messing with that area, or you just irritate the skin.  If it's a really nasty pimple, pop it, and then try back a few hours/day later.  It's really tempting to overdo it, so use it wisely

If I'm going to stay in, or just go to an area where I'm not self conscious, I'll just let the pimple heal on it's own.  Sometimes before bed I might put a small dab of toothpaste on the pimple.

If I'm going out, and want to cutdown redness on a recently popped pimple I do this:

Take an advil/ibuprofen and break it open. I place the open tablet on the pimple.  I then will add a few drops of an eye redness remover, like Rhotos, or Naphcon-A on the crushed tablet.  I leave it on for 10-15 minutes.

Finally, I typically use a tinted [moisturizer](http://www.amazon.com/Aveeno-Positively-Radiant-Moisturizer-2-5-Ounce/dp/B003O7IBUW/ref=sr_1_1?s=beauty&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1334197000&amp;sr=1-1) (medium because I'm tan) on my face and the pimple.  This stuff actually works pretty damn well for evening out my face, without looking like makeup.  I suggest only one pump, as if you try to put a lot on, then it will look like you are wearing makeup (as many things, less is more, and ends up looking better).  The goal of the moisturizer is to even out your skin, not hide every flaw (and it has SPF protection!).  You can be amazed on how having an ""even"" complexion makes you look pretty damn good!

**TL;DR: Use a comedome extractor, keep sterile with hydrogen peroxide.  A crushed advil and eye drop redness remover can remove redness.  Tinted moisturizer for evening out your complexion.**

Acid Peels. Acid peels once a week changed my complexion. It's important to wear sunscreen with SPF 30 or higher everyday. I had hyperpigmentation (darkening spots after acne) but they have faded away and it's hard to see them. They are usually 10-30 dollars.

There are two types of acid peel BHA and AHA. BHA is Salicylic Acid Peel, and AHA is Glycolic and Lactic Acid Peels. Use BHA if you are dealing with acne. Use AHA for everything else. AHA is better because acid penetration is deeper and promotes cell turnover. 

Vivite Night Cream. This one has 20% glycolic acid in it and my face shines in the morning ever since I used it. This one is usually 80 dollars but Amazon is selling for like 30 dollars.

Hair

Keratin Earth - It's like 100 dollars. I've straightened my hair before as a guy. My hair is messy and curly when longer, and I have huuuuge forehead. So I hate having short haircut, as much as I want it. I've never used this one, but read and heard it's amazing. It's a 4 step system for straightening hair and it really works.


Teeth

Luster Now - This one is interesting. This instantly whitens teeth for a few hours, not really white, but by illusion.

A lot of my friends seem to think the completely hairless look is always the right path to take, but I disagree, I know there's enough of the female population that likes a hairy man to justify keeping some.

I want to keep my chest hair, I dig it. But I'm not sure what to do with the treasure trail.

I want to do away with the neck, shoulder, triceps, upper back, and mid-back hair.

If I waxed the aforementioned spots, and kept the chest hair, would this be a normal look? What should I do with the treasure trail?

I feel like there is some sort of wax style that would clean me up and leave me with my chest hair. Please enlighten me, it would be greatly appreciated.

EDIT: Thanks for the replies, everyone. After reading through your advice, I've decided my original idea is the way to go. I'll keep the chest hair as planned, trim the trail a bit, and get the rest waxed.

Yet I do honestly believe I have issues that transcend this conundrum. It transcends the thematic boundaries of this subreddit, as well, because there's something I have to do to learn better facial expressions, too.

So, this is what I see in the mirror: [Four pic imgur album, the alright one](http://imgur.com/a/SXF3K). Not the best looking guy in the world, but this is something I can roll with.

Now, this is apparently what the world sees: [Four pic imgur album, the ugly one](http://imgur.com/a/eK1GX).

It's not what I see in the mirror, even when I try to rotate my head so that I see it from the same angle as on the picture. What is this weird pigmentation all over my face? Especially on the cheeks where the stubble should be, and these red areas below the eye bags. And the facial expressions. What the actual fuck? (I don't think it's the glasses).

I've figured these out for myself: shave everyday; get a better haircut.

But there are at least two things I have no idea what to do with:

* the pigmentation and the overall unhealthy look of the skin;

* the facial expressions. Good facial expressions better be a learnable skill.

So I'm starting a new job soon as a manager and it's a requirement that I am really clean-shaven every day.  I've worked as the lowly peon before where I was supposed to do this but could generally get aware with 3-4 days between shaves (I'm a fairly slow grower).  However, now I'm the guy that will be checking the lowly peons so I feel I can't be a hypocrit about this.

Problem is, I get razor burn pretty bad and if I'm shaving every day then I fear that my neck will look like raw meat within a few days.

I've heard people talk about straight edges and proper safety razors but I get confused in all the talk about what I should actually get.  Will those really help with razor burn?  I've sadly been using a Mach3 for most of my shaving career.  Never really dabbled much in aftershave or anything.

Specifically from one side of the chest to the other when the color of the hair matches the pubes but no other hair on your body--though hair on head has always been light brown.

I'm 24, and my body hair has always been either completely blonde or varying shades of light brown. Pubes, however, have been very dark black. That line down from my belly button (about 1-2"" wide, that most guys get) has been dark black for years but recently it has widened to the whole front of my chest below the belly button. Basically like the color of my pubes are slowly taking over and darkening my chest from the front up.

I honestly wouldn't care, typically, and would just let the inner manliness fly. But, especially when I trim below and don't do anything about the lower chest hair, I feel it looks really weird--almost like my pubes cover my entire lower chest. Maybe it's just me because it's still a new change, but it is very noticeably different from the rest of my chest and everywhere else. 

**Give me some advice on what would look best/be most manly:**

**Let it fly and rock the hey, check how my manly pubes are asserting dominance on my blonde body look; trim it much more often and maintain the line down from the belly button; or, shave all below the belly button to match the rest (keeping the pubes, of course) until the darkness takes over (I do feel like the trail down only is kinda immature looking just by itself)**",,False,self,t5_2s4uu,False,,,True,t3_ym4qg,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/ym4qg/help_my_pubes_have_annexed_my_until_now_blonde/,

2. Toner

I'm in high school, and my main group of friends don't care about their hygiene at all. I know for a fact that 3 of them do not brush their teeth.  They don't use deodorant, shave, or wash their hair.  Their showers are limited, maybe once or twice a week.  Often some of them will come to school with food stains on their cloths from the night before.  



My buds are great guys and they are quite fun to hang out with, but being with people that smell doesn't improve my image in anybody's eyes.  It is also uncomfortable for me, because sometimes I find myself standing a few feet back from them so I can't smell them.



I have tried talking to them about it before, asking them to brush their teeth because I can smell their breathe.  I actually carry breath mints for them sometimes(it's that bad.)  I try not to be condescending, and every time I try to drop even a slight hint it is met with hostility.


I don't really want to ditch this group of friends, because they are all smart, and we share similar interests a lot of the time.  However, I do know that hanging out with that group of people makes me look bad in other people's eyes, as they group me in with the smelly kids.

Is there any advice I can get to try and convince these guys to take better care of themselves?

I thought about it for a while and realized that I would need to be rather precise with this, so a lot of conventional shaving went right out the window. 

*Also, please note that I do not have an extremely massive bush. anything that requires me to have a massive bush will not work*

So far I have the following ideas. It's not much, but here goes:

* Get some kind of tape and cut it out in the letters desired, then shave everything around that
* Do the exact opposite, and cut the letters into the tape, and then only shave the letters out and keep everything around the letters
* Somehow use Nair... although I may regret saying that. 
* I have no idea what kind of grooming devices are out there, but I imagine a nose hair trimmer would be quite accurate, is it not?

I've been losing weight for 6 months now, just mentioning that before anyone throws out the ""lose weight"" advice.

I've not shaved in a while so I could have a blank canvas. My usual styles were the tried-and-tested circle beard (with unstyled moustache), and a short full beard trimmed to somewhere between a 3 and a 5 with a neckline that follows from top of the Adam's Apple to the ""corner"" of the jaw beneath the ears.

I haven't been clean shaven since I was 15 (21 now) and I don't really want to go with the clean look. As I said, I'm losing weight, but I still have quite the double chin.

Right now with the bushy vacation beard I look like a neonazi so whatever I do I figure it's going to have to be short and neat. My persona is the complete opposite of the tough guy skinhead and as it is now I look like a biker on his way to a klan meeting.

Should I seek to shape them now or is it already enough of an improvement? I definitely like them where they are now...it's a massive upgrade. Just looking for opinions.

When I was in highschool I started developing very bad acne.  I ended up taking Accutane, and it got rid of the acne, but for a while my face would dry out so easily, I had to carry moisturiser on me at all times.  That only lasted a couple of years.  Nowadays, I no longer get acne, but my face is really shiny looking.  It's been this way for a long time, and sometimes it makes me embarrassed to look at myself in the mirror, and when someone takes a picture of me using a flash it's like a beacon.

I've tried several things when looking for advice online.  I tried washing my face twice a day with a cleanser, then moisturising with a moisturiser that has sylic acid or something like that.  Washing my face only made it much worse.

I'd noticed when I get out of the shower after just washing my face my forehead would look extra shiny, so I thought maybe my face needed that oil, and getting rid of it was what made my face shiny.  So I took another recommendation and didn't wash my face at all, just ran water over it in the shower.  Still no.  Even with moisturising.

I've taken vitamin B pills, as I read this can help at the source of the oil producing glands.  No help.

I'm really tired of looking like a greasy monstrosity.  You might be able to tell that it really shatters my self esteem.  I'm pleading for some help.

The one thing I can think of (for my hair, at least) would be to wear a swim cap during practice to limit the amount of pool water that it would be in contact with.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated :)",,False,self,t5_2s4uu,False,,,True,t3_1i2u3g,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/1i2u3g/swimmer_needs_advice_about_nasty_hair_dry_skin/,

I've always had a high hairline, but in the past six months it's gotten noticeably worse, and receded about a quarter of an inch further back, while being visibly thinner behind that. I'm guessing it's probably exacerbated by some excess stress, mostly related to a new job and some changes in my life, but that's not really anything I can change at this point.

My wife and I are trying to get pregnant, and the side effects of Rogaine, Propecia, and the like are pretty scary. They even say not to let a pregnant woman touch the tablets for one of them, and both of them can have possible side effects on your sperm and hormones (I already have low sperm motility, so I definitely don't want to contribute with anything else that could be bad). So I'm looking for alternatives to harsh stuff like this.

Obviously without going into Finasteride or Minoxidil I'm not expecting a miracle or anything, I'm more just hoping to slow the process down a little bit, or even stop contributing to the problem. I bought some Saw Palmetto supplements, and have been eating lots of pumpkin seeds (I heard this can help block DHT), but I was wondering if there were other things I could start trying.

There are plenty of shampoos and conditioners that claim to help out, but I have no clue if any of these actually work.

Here's what I gathered after reading some top posts:

- crest white strips
- shampoo once a week
- conditioner every day
- dove body wash every day (with a wash sponge/cloth)
- face wash every day
- exfoliant 3 days
- face moisturiser everyday with spf+15/30
- wash cloth/sponge

^ That's the stuff I'm going to buy. Probably the best brand I can find living in Canada and from Shoppers Drug Mart (Nivea, L'Oreal)

Now what order should I do it in? I feel like I should take a shower first (I like to take a shower as soon as I wake up daily, is this recommended)

- Hair shampoo once a week
- Hair conditioner every day
- Dove body wash every day (with a wash sponge/cloth)

Then after that

- Face wash every day 
- Exfoliant every 3 days
- Face moisturiser every day

How's that? I have a few blemishes on my cheeks that come and go as they please but this should help with that.

Also usually after I take a shower I style my hair into a fauxhawk just after drying it and it stays like that all day without the need of a gel/wax. Thanks.",,False,self,t5_2s4uu,False,,,True,t3_15wm4d,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/15wm4d/help_with_my_routine_complete_noob/,

This ended up with me not shaving properly from the age of 14-18 (technically still). I had always thought you shaved against the grain. And doing this for years has given me very thick and coarse facial hair around my chin and upper lip.
When I realized this I tried shaving with the grain but it doesn't look like I shaved at all. Normally this wouldn't be a problem but my facial hair is not very even. It's thick on my chin and upper lip only, with the middle of my upper lip bare. So because of this I have still been shaving against the grain, and if the razor isn't brand new I get razor burn and ingrown hairs.
Currently I use the Schick Quattro Titanium to shave as it's the razor that has given me the least razor burn. Some one please help me with how I can fix this, I can't afford electrolysis and have lately been thinking about getting it waxed to see if it'll fix the problem.

The picture shows how it looks when I shave with the grain.

But I'm about to graduate from grad school and have an internship this semester *as a consultant*, and I don't know the first thing about hair cuts.

[Photographic evidence of my hair at different lengths](http://imgur.com/a/CtZE0#0)

How much are they supposed to cost?  I think $20 is a good price, but the only places that cheep around here (southwest michigan) are great clips and cost cutters etc, and they usually butcher my hair.  I thought about going to a *Hair Salon*, but they charge upwards of $50!  That seems like way too much for me, especially if I'm not going to get any better of a hair cut.

And that leads me to point two: What the fuck, my own hair?  I have... wavy, large-curled hair which comes from whichever ethnicity produced it - dutch or jewish being the most likely culprits.  When it's short, it's all cowlicks.  when it's long, it's a full-on white-boy 'fro.  My classmates and colleagues all have these really great, professional, business-person haircuts but I never think that my hair would lay flat enough for them.  Will having a more-expensive haircut solve this problem?

A related problem is that I never know what my hair should look like.  I go in and they say ""how do you want it cut?""  What I want to say is, you're the expert, you figure it out.  but I don't.  I say ""short on the top and the sides, but don't use clippers.""  Is there some way to figure this out?

And finally, how often am I supposed to plop down my hard-earned cash to get a haircut?  Biweekly?  Monthly?  Typically I get about 5-6 haircuts a year, and it seems like I should get more, but I am so afraid of the whole process that I just don't do it.

Laser hair removal sounds appealing because it has the potential to be permanent -- but I've heard different things from different people about how well it lasts. (I have also heard that it can darken freckles, which could be problematic.) There's also the fact that it's ludicrously expensive - I've heard between $1500 and $5000 thrown around as ballpark for a series of treatments. I can afford it, but if it doesn't last I'd feel pretty dumb for throwing that money away. Has anyone gone this route?

Some worked for a day - but then after a while, while maintaining these things my skin would still dehydrate, eyes get baggy, and flakes on the dry spots.

The facial routine I'm doing seem like band-aid solutions, There must me something I am neglecting or doing wrong, I heard a frozen gel masks can do wonders for a puffy face, each morning!

I have an appointment with a dermatologist but that takes a few months, I apologize if I may seem a bit melodramatic but this truly is my biggest (and only) insecurity and it haunts me for years, I have friends that use zero products for this stuff, have retarded sleeping habbits and somehow always look perfectly awake.

I've tried rogaine, but it made my face puffy, and fucked with my eyes. I'm really sensitive to meds so i stopped using it, and for that same reason don't want to try propecia.

SO what do you think? Should i shave it/buzz it when the time comes (which will prob be soon). Do my glasses look bad? what things can i do with beard, what about my eyebrows, etc?

I want to look as GOOD as possible. Right now i'm thinking i won't look good bald. :(

Story inside.,seager,15,3,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/t0kh9/so_today_i_epilated_my_back_hair_story_inside/,"Yes, that's it - you read it right. Today, I went down to my department store with my girlfriend and bought myself a Braun epilator (a pink one at that!)

A little background: I don't have a particularly hairy back - it’s patchy in places but the hairs are rather coarse. Getting my top off in public like at the beach and whatnot was something I avoided because of it, so about a year ago I experimented a bit with hair removal cream....now I don't know if you've ever tried to use veet on your own back, but it's bloody hard to say the least. My first attempt was a failure as far as I was concerned, as my hairy back remained patchy, but with slightly bald patches in the patchy hair that grew back pretty quickly.

Second attempt was at shaving - now you can imagine how that went.....very much like the hair removal cream and didn't last long at all. Failure 2.

Thirdly, I tried waxing - I was going to need a second person for this and booked myself an appointment at a local beauty salon for a back wax. That was....painful (maybe about a 5-6 on a scale). The lady was nice though which helped and it did remove ALL OF THE HAIR! Result! Now my back was quite red and I was under strict instructions like ""Don't exercise"" etc. These were all completely followed down to the letter but I woke up the next morning with the redness still there and expanding into rather large mounds, much like as if I had been stung by a hundred little bees.

Now these turned into big-ol' spots and I had to wait for 3 weeks for them all to heal properly (which was incidentally the exact amount of time it took for my back hair to grow back) FAIL NUMBER 3...

Which brings me neatly to today. I had my epilator, my girlfriend and ice (for the swelling, as instructed by the manual).

To cut it short....it hurt like hell. Was a 9 probably on the pain scale, with me having to tap out every 4 seconds for an hour before the relatively light job was done completely....but how did it come out? Very well - I’m very happy with it - there's no more pain and I have a very smooth back and a suitably impressed girlfriend.

TL;DR: If all else fails, think about how much pain you're willing to endure for the sake of your vanity.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask!

I already use hair product, and my hair looks somewhat similar (in style, color, and in texture/thickness) to [this kid](http://i.imgur.com/qWpGh.jpg?1). Funnily enough I had hair like the left when i was younger, and now it looks more like the right. The only difference is that my hair is thick, but only because there's so much of it. It's actually quite airy and straight, which makes it hard to style in any way. Basically, some days I need product to keep it from getting blown all over the place or laying straight down like a bowl cut, and some days I don't. 

Is there an issue with my hair product? Should I be using conditioner? If so, what conditioner do you recommend? Right now I use just Suave for Men deep cleaning shampoo and no conditioner. Will it help to use conditioner, and should I go 2-in-1 or will it not matter? Finally, is there a different process I should be going through when I get out of the shower, such as blow drying it or applying product only when fully dry?

The other question I have is regarding a razor. Right now I have an electric razor, but it's causing a little too much irritation for my liking, and I always hear much better things about shaving with manual razors. However, I only *need* to shave about twice a week, three times if I want to stay especially clean-cut. Should I bother learning to use one of those double-sided razors or just get a Gilette (or whatever brand you recommend). Additionally, what shaving cream and aftershave do you recommend? Right now I just wash my face after shaving and use a Nivea for Men aftershave lotion.

Is this permanent?",martensen713,17,6,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/ywka4/hair_loss_recently_switched_hair_styles_and/,"Ok, so here's how it goes. I am 21 years old and up until about... 2 or 3 months ago I have had quite a thick, full head of hair. I shampooed on a daily basis and used some hair gel in the front for a messy, spiked, ""ski-jump"" type hairstyle.

At that point I decided to switch it up, try something new. As my typically short hair grew out, I was going to start ""slicking"" it back. I wanted... flow, for lack of a better word.

Since that time, I have been combing my hair back daily after showers. I reduced shampoo use to 1 or 2 times a week, and about 3 weeks ago I stopped using shampoo completely. It is at that point (when I ceased the use of shampoo) that I noticed my hairline quickly receeding and the hair at the front of my head thinning out. 

When I began with this new hairstyle I would have a round shape at the front, which peaked in the middle. Now... it's flat on top. I don't know is that is a good enough description.

Either way, I have started losing hair. I have only noticed it at the front, everywhere else seems to be just as thick.

Is this from constant combing and running my fingers through my hair (to keep it back)? Is it from lack of shampoo? I read that people noticed an improvement in the condition of their hair without shampoo. My hair isn't dirty by any means, I give 'er a good scrub in the shower, it's not greasy, but could this still be the reason?

As far as baldness in the family... My dad is in his 60s and has a respectable amount of hair. One of my grandads was mostly bald from what I remember, but the other still has hair in his late 70s. My brother, however, has been balding for some time now. He is five years older than me and has some serious power alleys, and his crown is pretty faded. But at the same time, when he was my age he had been noticably balding already, whereas my case has suddenly appeared.

Is this permanent and ongoing? Should I be concerned? Is there a chance this is kind of a ""phase"" and my hair can grow back?

I apologize for the wall of text but I wanted to give as much information as possible and, well... I really have become attached to the fact that I have a good head of hair and I would be disappointed if I had truly started balding.

Just a quick note- this is one of a few variations on the July box. The contents are based on your profile that you fill out after signing up for the service.

This service is $20/month which I think is reasonable based on what I received this month. [Here](http://imgur.com/a/xupEw) is a link to the album of the contents from my box. I had 5 items in my box. [Here](http://www.birchbox.com/men/) is the website for Birchbox if you want to investigate it. If you do decide to sign up and would like to give me credit, PM me and I will give you a referral code. **This is not why I'm writing this guide, you do not have to use a referral code so please don't downvote**. You do have to get on a waiting list and I'm not sure if having a code will bump you up. It didn't take very long before I was able to subscribe. On to the review!

* The box itself is very compact and does not waste packing material.
* On top is a card listing the contents, what they are, and how to use them. It also describes the theme for the month, this month is summer inspiration. 
* The backside of the card has a recipe for a Michelada (Mexican spicy beer cocktail-try it) and a little story about Abe Lincoln.
* The first item is a Wrapster from Quirky. It is used to help keep your earbuds wrapped in a clean manner and can also serve as a stand for your iPhone. I like the blue and will probably get a lot of use out of this. Retails for $7.
* Next up, also from Quirky is Cordies. This is for use on your desk to help organize your various cables. Same blue as the Wrapster. This model holds 4 cables. Should be very useful for me. Retails for $10.
* Next is a pre-shave oil sample from John Allan called Slickwater. A full size version retails for $29 for 2 oz. This sample, .25 fl. oz., will last for quite a few shaves. You only need a few drops for good coverage I've found. It contains tea tree oil, cucumber, oats, Vitamin A &amp; C. Smells really good too.
* Moving on, we have CoSTUME NATIONAL in the scent INTENSE. It retails for $140 and this sample is .05 fl. oz. It should last me a few nights out. It smells like a combination of several floral scents with a hint of darker, more masculine flavors. May be a little to feminine smelling for me but I'll try it out and see what others think of it on me.
*  Lastly, I got a teeth whitening system from Supersmile that retails for $36. It is a sample size .21 oz for each of the 2 tubes. One tube is the toothpaste and one is the whitening component. I'm really looking forward to using this. I've been wanting to whiten my teeth for a while now. 

So I received 2 full sized products and 3 sample size. Each of the samples should allow quite a few uses so I'm happy with that. Overall, I am very happy with this box and look forward to what is in store for August.

Please leave any questions or comments about this summary, the products, or the service and I'll get back to you. Also, any comments or tips on formatting and whether you would like me to continue doing these. I've also posted this in 4 subreddits to see which one really responds so I won't have to post to so many places if I continue.

Thanks!

My hair is now currently [this](http://i.imgur.com/CFveu.jpg). I've never had super short hair due to the fact I've got a large forehead and a [receding hairline](http://i.imgur.com/ZRDSQ.jpg). It's been that way since I was a child. I'm now 23.

I want (need) some guidance with regards to personal hygiene.
I haven't really had something that just lays out the basics, so now I'm coming to you. 

If there's a better/more appropriate subreddit for this let me know. 

My current situation: I'm male, 24. 

I just started actually shaving my face. I have some Gillette shaving pack that came with a razor, shaving cream, 
deodorant, body wash.
&gt; What should I know about shaving stuff? 

&gt; Is there a proper way to shave? 

&gt; Are there some things I should watch out for? (E.g. 'Don't shave upwards' or 'Only go so far up by your ears' etc...)

&gt; Does one kind of razor perform better than another? 

I get a hair cut only when I have to (last time was 2 years ago).

&gt; I don't know anything about getting my hair cut.

&gt; I don't know what to ask for. I don't know what to look for. 

&gt; I don't know what things to consider when choosing a hair style.

&gt; Is there a real difference between a cheap hair cut or an expensive one?

&gt; How often does one get a hair cut?

I brush my teeth about once a day.

&gt; Does the type of tooth paste matter at all?

&gt; Is there a preferred tooth brush? (I have some electric one I got at CVS)

&gt; Perhaps some other tips? (I do make a once over specifically for the gum-tooth border)

I shower about 2 or 3 times a week. 

&gt; Better shampoo/conditioners? 

&gt; I've heard/read things about not using shampoo each time? Why not? Should I also skip conditioner? 

&gt; Body wash? 

And for all of the above:

&gt; Is there anything else I should know/consider? 

Basically I've been doing about the minimum required to not appear homeless. 
Now, I'm looking to really get into better habits and general get educated.

After using acne.org's BP ""regimen"" two times every day for about three years my skin suddenly started reacting to it in a bad way. Like so: [rashes kinda](http://eho.st/ppnz7rbb+) (sorry about the stubble). I stopped using it, smeared my face with cortisone for a couple of days and it went away.

Since this happened I haven't been using any facial products (2-3 weeks) and my skin is starting to get worse. I wash my face a couple of times a day, but that's pretty much it.

Anyhow I am going to Tokyo in about two weeks and would love some advice on how to make my skin feel better until then. I am feeling a bit hopeless now that I can't use the BP anymore. If anyone has any advice I would be super grateful. Thank you!

2-3 a week I use L'Oreal Exfoliating Wash [Link](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VWGXMQ/ref=oh_o02_s00_i00_details)

**Night:**

I use the Selsum Blue Naturals as a facewash for the 3% SA content, if not I just use the Stridex Pads.

And I use a fresh towel every night as my pillowcase.

**My goals:**

Get rid of acne (especially the red dots)

Get rid of the dark circles under my eyes

Maintain a healthy skin for the long-term as well as the short-term

Prepare to spend 6 months in the Australian sun (I would like to find a good sunblock that is both sweatproof and waterproof)

I get mild acne, mostly where I shave, and I've always had noticeable pores on my cheeks and nose, with blackheads occurring on my nose from time to time. This stuff has stopped all of that and made my skin way smoother and softer.

Anything that says ""calcium bentonite clay"" on it will work, but I got [Aztec Secret Indian Healing Clay](http://www.amazon.com/Aztec-Secret-Indian-Healing-Clay/dp/B0014P8L9W) from Whole Foods and I think I paid $6 for the 1lb tub. You mix it with water and/or apple cider vinegar (using ACV can be really drying, so be careful), spread it all over your face, and leave it for 10-20 minutes. If you've mixed it right, it'll feel like your face is pulsating and tightening as the clay dries. Once it dries, rinse it off in the shower. It can be difficult to rinse but try not to use any soaps or cleansers to get it off, just be patient.

I do this a couple times a week before bed, and put on a ton of moisturizer after to counteract the dryness. Since I started using it my skin has looked so much better and it's so soft I have to keep reminding myself not to touch it.

I'm writing today because I see so many articles looking for help with a variety of skin problems. I hope this will help some of you who have **acne, flaking skin, itchiness, eczema-like conditions, rosacea, dermatitis, brandy nose etc**. Since it was an article posted here that helped me so much, I wanted to share my experience with you.

Let's start with some information about me. I'm currently 27 years old, and have had few skin problems. I never had acne as a teenager, no eczema, no allergies. I eat well, and try to take care of my skin, though not so rigorously as some of you. Overall, I'm healthy. I haven't gone to a general doctor in... well I don't know. I'm not much of a natural remedy person; I'd go for the prescription medicine over the vitamin/herbal route any day.

It was roughly three years ago that I started to notice dry skin on my face. It began on my cheeks to either side of my nostrils. At first, I thought it was extra sun as I had started wearing reflective sunglasses on a regular basis and I was outside more often. So I started using SPF 30 sunscreen on my face every day. The situation did not improve. It slowly got worse.

The most affected area of my face was in the creases next to my nostrils, but the dry, itchy skin formed into a patch that almost covered my nose and spread out almost to the outside of my eyes at its worst. I tried various moisturizers and cleaning solutions. From lotion to oils, petroleum jelly, cleaning with an astringent, steroid creams, etc. Some things helped temporarily but never for long. I noticed some other peculiarities: symptoms were milder when I changed my pillowcase often, intensity would come in cycles - good for a week or so then a breakout, some treatments would help for a while then I'd have a breakout, etc. I thought nothing of these at the time and assumed I was dealing with something like eczema. Unfortunately I don't have pictures, but my case looked a lot like the example here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Seborrhoeic_dermatitis.jpg

After several months and worsening conditions, I had a major breakout. I woke up one morning and the affected area was bright red, raw, and extremely itchy (think poison ivy). I tried to moisturize and not to scratch. Everyone noticed the problem, and I was going out of my mind. I finally made an appointment with a dermatologist for the following week. That evening or the next day I tried using a dandruff shampoo on my face. After a few minutes dead skin rinsed off like I was molting. That week the condition was the best it had been in months, though not completely gone.

At my dermatologist appointment, it took about 30 seconds to be diagnosed with seborrheic dermatitis and rosacea. I was prescribed sodium sulfacetamide and went on my merry way. Finally glad to have a name to put to my ailment and a treatment to use, I began doing some research. Unfortunately, I found out that the causes of seborrhea are not very well understood. Various sources listed diet, bacteria, fungus, immune problems and genetics as things that caused or resulted in an excess of sebum causing seborrhea. Most resources agreed that it is a chronic problem that only seems to go away when your body decides it's time. This was somewhat disheartening, but I figured I'd see how well the prescription worked.

The sulfacetamide did well to control my seborrhea. I never had another bad breakout. It stunted the flakiness and moisturized my skin enough that after my morning regimen no one noticed the condition on my face. For three years I was content with the results and I came to terms with the fact that I'd be using a prescription cream in the long term.

In May of this year, I went on vacation for a week to a beach house, and spent a large amount of time outside in the sun and in a pool. By the end of the week my face was completely clear - to the point that I was considering not using my prescription and calling myself healed. Alas, it did not last. A week or two after I got home the seborrhea came back and my hopes were dashed.

In the following months my face got progressively (but very slowly) worse. Or maybe it was just that I had gotten a glimmer of hope and then was dissatisfied with my current results. Maybe it was actually that the prescription was expired. Maybe it was that I started wearing glasses and the nosepieces were in constant contact with my skin. In any case, I called up the doctor for a refill, but since it had been so long I had to go in for another consultation. 

Same deal. Seborrhea/rosacea. How's it working? You satisfied? Yeah, ok good. Here's a refill. Also it might help to start washing your face with Selsun Blue. This was a Tuesday in September. I picked up some shampoo and started using it, along with my refilled prescription. Cue /r/skincareaddiction. [You probably remember this article](http://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/z33nz/heres_some_happy_news_rosacea_could_be_caused_by/) that was posted that Friday. For me, this turned out to be very good news. I spent the entire afternoon at work researching demodex. I read reference works, results of studies, first person accounts. The more I read, the more I was convinced this was the problem. Everything started to add up. Breakouts that seemed to come in cycles, symptoms affected by how often I changed my bedding, clearing up while on vacation; these were things I noticed. Sources also described symptoms I hadn't noticed like enlarged pores. I explained about me at the beginning of this write-up so that you'd know I'm not a hypochondriac. But I was confident that was I had experienced for three years was finally explained.

I found this website: [demodexsolutions.com](http://www.demodexsolutions.com/). Perhaps like me, it looks to you to be quite hokey or even a scam. But upon further inspection I realized that all the information was consistant with what I had researched. It showed pictures and explained how to test for demodex. It has a forum with people asking for help and solutions. You didn't have to pay for the information up front. So even though it isn't so well designed, and the English is broken, I decided it's trustworthy enough.

I went home and performed the test as they suggested. I had a microscope in the basement and took a sample of sebum from 8-10 of my pores. I found 4 demodex mites, clear as the pictures they show on that site and others. Now I realize that most people have some demodex, but at a rate of 40-50% of pores I sampled convinced me 100% that I had found the problem. As you might expect I was completely creeped out. So after I ordered the ointment and cream I was up all night washing all my sheets and bedding and cleaning all around my bed.

It took about two weeks for my package to come, and I started using the ointment at night and cream in the morning. Within five days my skin was completely cleared up. It's been a month now and I've had no recurrence. I am still using both products and will continue for the recommended three months of treatment.

**I am not affiliated with www.demodexsolutions.com**, I'm just another average redditor who found a solution to his problem. You may be able to find products with the same ingredients elsewhere. But I understand the frustration caused by skin conditions where you stand looking in the mirror screaming ""WHY WON""T IT JUST GO AWAY?!"" I've been there.

That site claims **""Adolescent acne is for 90% caused by Human Demodex mites, Demodex Folliculorum &amp; Brevis, adult acne forms, acne rosacea, some other kinds of rosacea, brandy nose, widened large pores, itching face and scalp, itching eyelashes and eyebrows plus other demodex related skin problems.""** I only had seborrhea and rosacea, but because of information on their forums and in other studies I am inclined to believe that at least a large amount of these problems are caused by demodex. There are other conditions also attributed to demodex not listed here like atopic dermatitis. Even if it was only half of what they claim, that would be 45% of acne sufferers that could easily be treated. **Breakouts that come in cycles and changes in routine that cause breakouts are a good indicator of demodex.**

I don't know why western doctors don't admit that demodex can be a problem. I've read that they are taught that demodex are naturally occurring and cause no skin problems. But more and more studies are suggesting that this is false. In my case, I can only go by what worked and what didn't. It seems that it's rare to find a dermatologist that would thoroughly investigate your individual skin problem and look at all possibilities.

When I post here regarding skin problems, I always suggest going to a dermatologist. Demodex certainly isn't the cause of every skin condition. Just be informed that it likely won't even be considered as a possibility. If you suspect your problem is demodex, get a microscope and test for it.

This mask is great before going out, it will help take down redness, swelling  and water retention that you might have in your face!

**What you’ll need:**

2 teaspoons cocoa powder

2-4 uncoated aspirin pills (grinded up)

A few drops of water to make the above a paste

Alternatives: Try mixing the cocoa powder and grinded up aspirin pills with yogurt or substitute the cocoa entirely with plain yogurt.

**How it works**

Aspirin, or acetylsalicylic acid is a powerful anti-inflammatory and will soothe the skin and reduce swelling. It’s similar to salicylic acid, which is found in acne treatments – but it does not exfoliate and is not irritating.

Cocoa powder contains antioxidants and flavanols, as well it helps absorb oil and remove dirt from the surface of the skin. Choose an non dutch processed  cocoa powder for more benefits (these are generally the bitter tasting ones).

The cocoa in this mask is really just a carrier for the aspirin powder. You can substitute plain yogurt, clay powder, or even mix the aspirin powder in to your moisturizer to make the mask.

I personally find that the cocoa absorbs like a clay mask, but is less drying.

**It’s super easy to make:**

1. Grind up the uncoated aspirin pills in a pestle and mortar
2. Add in the cocoa powder
3. Finally mix in a few drops of water until it gets to a spreadable consistency (It helps to use an eye dropper to do this, but a spoon will do).

**Tip!** If you do end up liking this mask, you can just crush a bottle of the uncoated aspirin in a blender and store it in a jar for later use.

**How to use it**

Spread it on gently and give it 15 minutes or more to do its magic! The majority of it should be on your cheeks, nose and chin. You can even bring it down to your neck.

To remove, simply wet your face and gently rinse it off – try not to scrub your skin, though it might feel nice, scrubbing can cause small tears in your skin possibly leading to infections and acne.

Use it for special occasions, but it’s gentle enough to use daily – just make sure you don’t scrub your skin with it. Don’t apply it to broken or raw skin.

I have a really big problem with hair on my body. It's not so much a visual thing as a confidence thing. My ex broke up with me because I was too nervous about it to get into bed, or let him see me naked/topless/anything like that. Regardless of how hot it is, I never wear shorts and always wear long sleeves. I refuse to go swimming in case someone sees. Really it's the biggest problem I have with myself at the moment.

**The Problems;**

 * Chest/back - It's horrible. I have a kind-of sparse but long growth on my back, like there are a few really long, dark hairs on my upper and middle back.
 * Stomach/chest - That's just weird. If it was a 'happy trail' it would be OK, but it's just everywhere. There's much more above the belly button than below it, just in a sort of patch to the one side. It's also really dark, and quite noticeable even when really short.
 * Pubic/legs - My pubic hair and my leg hair blend into one horrible mess. I can't seem to get it in a way where it doesn't just look like a line. I want my upper legs/hips to be smooth but I can't seem to get it in a way that it 'blends' rather than just looking like a line.
 * Arms - I hate it on my upper arms, it's doing the retarded long-but-sparse thing like my back. It's also way too dark. I don't have a problem with the amount, and wouldn't want them smooth, it's just really dark and horrible.

I really want to go and get waxed properly. I tried to do it at home and it didn't really work that well (took ages, messy etc. Probably because I'm not very good at it). I'm not sure how I'd deal with the confidence barrier of going somewhere. I *know* the staff will always be professional, and make sure I'm happy etc. but it would still be a big deal. Any tips for getting over the initial confrontation? Also anything I should do/not do to prepare? (Other than half a bottle of vodka)

I waxed at home 4 days ago, and removed everything from the belly-button area, it's already grown back to ~1mm. Any tips on making it grow slower/masking it when it's too short to wax?

I don't want to remove any of the hair from my lower arms, but I want to make it thinner/less visible. Any tips on doing this?

**EDIT:** I know it's the aluminum that mixes with sweat to cause the staining. I googled the problem, but most of the articles don't offer many good solutions, since the aluminum is really the active ingredient in most anti-perspirants. I'm really more interested in how the guys of this subreddit handle this problem, like specific products that prevent sweat without ruining clothes.

When I'm wearing a nice shirt, I'll throw on an undershirt, but I live in Florida, so wearing an additional layer of clothes is not always an optimal solution when also trying to avoid getting sweaty. It seems like some people put on a dedicated anit-perspirant at night, then just a deodorant during the day, since the deodorant doesn't stain. If you do that, which products do you use and how well do they work? If you don't do that, and just use a normal anti-perspirant during the day, how well does it work and does it stain your shirts? If you don't sweat and can just wear a deodorant, then you're a lucky guy, but your opinion isn't really helpful for those of us that do sweat.",,False,self,t5_2s4uu,True,,,True,t3_nadvr,http://www.reddit.com/r/malegrooming/comments/nadvr/good_antiperspirantdeodorant_that_wont_ruin_my/,

- You will bleed; wear a shirt you don't mind getting blood on (and potentially wax.)

- It's not recommended to have a hot shower until 24 hours after the wax, so have one before you go.

- If your hair is too long, it can simply break in two instead of being pulled out. If it's too short, the wax won't catch it. It should be about a 1/4 inch long, so trim to this length before getting the wax.

That is a cheap device that does not work, and even if it did, is not capable of a buzz cut; only a trim.

I wanted to avoid having to shave my head outside because like I said I live in a trailer park and didn't want a bunch of people watching me do so. The only place I have an outlet outside is right in front of the road also.

I recently started using a medication which has a side effect of making my face ashy/flakey/peely, as well as more sensitive to sunlight. I need to find a moisturizer with some SPF in it to compensate.

Per my wife's suggestion, I was using a very over-priced, but amazing lotion by a brand called Super, however it was discontinued.  The company started a new line, but it's even more expensive and I just can't roll that hard on moisturizer.  

I tried Portland General Store's Victory ""moisturizer"", but it's kinda crappy.  I think it's more meant as a mild sunblock and not a moisturizer, but it wasn't marketed as such.  First off, it doesn't help with the peeling/flaky skin, and second it leaves a milky/chalky look on my skin.  It just doesn't absorb into my skin well.

My doctor suggested that since I have sensitive skin to try to find something non-comodegenic and preferably unscented, if anyone has any suggestions, I would really appreciate it.  It's pretty embarrassing to walk around with flaky, peeling skin all over my face!

This is my first post here.

I am a scuba diver, which means I spend a lot of time in the water and out under the sun. 

Besides sunblock cream (which I always use), what kind of face skin care product I can get to ensure good looking and healthy skin?

I frequently go on weeks long diving trips, diving from morning to early evening about 4 times a day. These trips also frequently take place on a liveaboard, meaning I'd be living on a boat for the duration of the trip. 

I usually just apply a sunblock cream in the morning and reapply throughout the day. I don't usually sunbath for long, probably just around 10 minutes between dives to get warm. The rest of the time I would stay under shade.

I usually just wash my face with a regular liquid soap about once a week. I don't usually put any moisturizer.

I have a very normal skin, never even had any breakouts during teenage years. My skin is not dry or not oily. Just nice.

However, I do smoke, and I think this makes my skin looks dull. Especially with a tan, it doesn't have that healthy glow.

Long time lurker of /mg, and never posted because well, I never really kept a routine shave going, just let the ol' beard grow and grow. I've trimmed it a few times this year, but mainly just going Grizzly Adams style.

* don't shave until 1/1/14
* trim every 2 weeks to maintain a sharp appearance
* take pictures along the way

I was thinking of one of two methods to donate: either a certain amount of money every day I have the beard, or you could donate roulette style--put a flat fee on what day you think I can't take it anymore and shave; and if I do cave in, I'll personally match whatever was put down on that day.

What do you guys think? I'm kinda doing it to let my beard grow in a little better, but doing it without looking like I belong on the street.

I keep it trimmed to under a quarter of an inch every three weeks or so, but I've rarely ever completely shaved my face - the number of times that I have I can count on both hands - but every time I do, including today, the skin below where my mustache used to be becomes red, purple, swollen and very irritated. I'm assuming this happens because I don't shave my mustache on a regular basis, but this doesn't happen with my chin hair though, just my mustache.

Is this normal? Is mustache hair any different from chin hair? It doesn't look or feel particularly course by comparison to me. And if I continued to shave my mustache on a regular basis, do you think it would become less irritated over time? Regular shavers of /r/MaleGrooming, please help a guy out!

EDIT: Oh yeah, this happens regardless of whether or not I use shaving cream.

EDIT 2: Thanks for all the advice, guys! Most of the questions seem to be pertaining to my prep and my technique, so let me just sum that up here.

I usually shave after my shower so my skin is warm and moist (no homo), and as far as my mustache is concerned, I usually shave downward, with single, individual swipes, rinsing the blade between each stroke. I use a Gillette Mach 3, with disposal triple bladed razor heads, and I make a point of using a fresh blade when shaving my whole face like this.

I hate products like Nair, because it I hate the way my skin feels afterwards and it never seems to do a good job.

I just started shaving only with the grain every few days, hoping that eliminates ingrown hairs / red spots. I can live with very small hairs on my chest, but it feels a little rough. :/ It's still coarse which I hate.

Does anyone know of a certain shaving cream that works well and stops ingrown hairs / red spots? What about hair wax that won't cause ingrown hairs or the ""pulling"" effect which irritates my skin?

I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions about what I can do with my hair to make it look better. During the winter (wrestling season) I keep my hair short, but in the spring / summer / fall I have the opportunity to grow it out.

[This Album](http://imgur.com/a/3IB53) includes some pictures of my hair right after I showered (and shampooed) and tried my hair with a towel. If you feel like you need higher quality images to make an assessment, please don't hesitate to ask. 

I usually shower (and shampoo) my hair twice a day because I am very active (working out / wrestling a lot) and my hair gets oily if I don't.
These pictures were taken a little over a month since my friend last cut my hair (using a #4 razor to just give me a buzz cut pretty much).

So, basically, does anyone know a hairstyle that might look a bit better than what I'm doing now? I feel as if this current style makes my face look bad, although I can't really explain why. I was thinking about buzzing the sides and maybe leaving the top short. 

Also, does anyone have any advice as to whether or not I should do something to my eyebrows? They have always been rather large and prominent. Any experts in here? I appreciate your time! Thanks a ton!

Whenever I shave I get small dotted pimples on my moustache area and on my cheeks. 
I use Gillete Mach3 blades, Gillete sensitive skin gel cream and Old Spice after-shave.

I initially start shaving in a downward direction, then go side wards director and in the last round of shaving -  in the opposite upward direction to achieve a closer shave. Am I doing it right?

So I'm going to the beach tomorrow, and I currently have a decent amount of back hair. I figured waxing would be the best treatment, but considering I've never done any back hair removal before, I don't want to go to the beach with some sort of rash from the waxing.
