I am a 17-year-old high schooler, and cannot afford all the love that reddit has. Thank you all. The final total is $234, including some extra donations that i've accredited to my friend/redditor Hanguo.
I offered him a cookie as a thank you for introducing me to reddit not 4 months ago, and he told me to donate the value of a cookie. Fair enough, Hanguo. Fair enough. If ten years from now, when I have more money, and I find that this post has some upvotes that are leftover, I shall make up the difference. Until then, Merry Christmas!

Thank you all.

I may be drained of funds, but feel free to make a donation yourself. The more you give, the more Africans can learn.

Here's my response to all those out there who are fed up with ""10 cents for every upvote..."" posts.
It's true that real charity is done silently, and not for the public. But I think posting in this manner does so much more...
1. This post is raising awareness of this fantastic charity.
2. I'm helping other people feel great about themselves this holiday season.
3. I'm honestly donating WAY MORE than I normally would. I'm just a 17-year-old high schooler, so I probably wouldn't be giving $200+ to charity on my own will.

This abomination of all that is logical and rational has been touted off-and-on today on the atheism subreddit, but thanks to his Noodliness, we will soon be in first place!

Seriously though, I noticed the gap is closing quick between our two groups, and I wanted to give you guys and gals fair warning to defend your place at the top. 

Here is the link to the Christian group: http://freerice.com/content-group/christians-fighting-world-hunger

It's super simple to start an account, and the piss-and-vinegar rivalry between atheists and Christians is best spent somewhere productive, like helping the poor. As a bonus, it really does stimulate your brain with all sorts of various categories, and some of the questions can be downright challenging.

Oh, and when you play, make sure you disable adblock for the site, as they pay for the rice with revenue from the ads.

Good luck, and happy ricing!

EDIT: Yep...Just refreshed the page showing the group totals and number of grains donated today. Someone in here is definitely doing their part. :)

To be honest I was still bitter about what had happened to her... In fact I had been struggling with my own faith and more then once I considered suicide. He... Asked that I would forgive him that day. I couldn't, but he kept at it. Finally... I was spending time in my bible and came across a verse about forgiveness... And it spoke to me.

However...I have recently been turned on to a completely different mindset thanks to r/atheism. Christ never got involved in politics. And ""Christians"" (or people claiming to be) today are destroying our reputation by doing so. It is time Christians listen to their own advice and read the bible. 

Christ never expected non-believers to believe in him. Or to act a certain way or behave a certain way. He hung out with them and loved them. As a Christian, I think its about time we stop destroying America from the top down (as well as our reputation) and try re-building it from the bottom up.

In fact, they typically protest the Southern Baptist Convention annual meeting. Also keep in mind that they do not meet the Biblical or historical standards necessary to call themselves a Christian church. As evidenced by their utter lack of Christian fruit, unwillingness to repent, and savage, incorrect doctrines, they are not even to be considered Christians. They are heretics of the lowest order. They do not accurately represent Jesus and I, for one, would greatly appreciate it if everyone would begin referring to them as ""the Westboro cult"" or something similar. Know that they're wrong, pray for their repentance, and please do not participate in their attempted hijacking of the words 'Baptist' or 'church.'

UPDATE - I'm loving this conversation. I've been trying to answer questions and comments as fast as I can. I hope this has been in some way edifying. My sincere hope is that we would all lean into the true Gospel, see our sin for what it really is, repent and trust in Christ to save us from our sins and redeem our lives by using us to make disciples in every city on the planet. One major reason I posted this was because I truly do not believe that these guys are following Jesus. And I don't want people to get a bad impression of who Christians are or who Christ is because of how they're acting. They may continue to call themselves a Christian church. The government may continue calling them that as well. Even the news organizations might do the same. But I won't. Why? Because in publicly disassociating myself from those who only preach hate,  I have the opportunity to tell people that Jesus loves them enough to die on their behalf. I also get the opportunity to warn those I mentor of the hypocrisy  of saying you're a christian and not producing fruit. I hope no one is too angry about all this.

According to journalist Jose Luis Gonzalez-Balado, who traveled with Mother Teresa on many occasions, the great hero of the faith was never late.  In consideration of those who she was scheduled to meet, she treated every appointment a solemn duty.  But he remembers an exception.  When an appointment with the Nuncio took her through the poorest section of the poorest part of town, she asked her driver to stop so she could visit.  She lost track of time caring for a broken elderly man, bathing him and cleaning his home.  To the chagrin of her driver she ended up arriving quite late to her appointment, which drew her biographer to a sort of epiphany: ""For her,"" he said, ""the poor occupy the top place in the social hierarchy.""

For her.  And for you.

The fact that /r/Christianity met its goal in a day no longer surprises me, because over this week you've demonstrated your deep desire to serve Christ as a part of this community.  The conversations that have made it to the top of the frontpage reflect a radically different subculture than the frontpage of other popular subreddits would have you believe.  A reminder to [love our neighbor at all costs](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tvtcv/a_plea_to_christians_out_there/).  Numerous [prayer](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tw2q0/hey_rchristianity_do_me_a_favor/) [requests](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tuolt/pray_for_me_rchristianity_im_getting_married_today/) met with your advice and intercession.  This community affirmed its [commitment to stand against hate](http://www.reddit.com/tb/tp687).  And it affirmed its [commitment to the poor and oppressed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Anarchism/comments/toliy/it_is_now_illegal_to_be_homeless_in_denver/).

You are the body of Christ - we should *expect* the body of Christ to do amazing things!

I want to thank every one of you who donated to this cause.  We made 132% of our original goal in just over a week, with donations ranging from a few dollars to hundreds of dollars.  While raising the original goal became impractical, donations *continued* flowing in, with some of our larger contributions showing up late last night.  Your money will be used to serve those people who occupy the highest place in your social hierarchy.  For you, the last come first.  You have responded to Christ's command to deny yourselves - the money with which the Lord has blessed you - and dedicate it to furthering His Kingdom here on earth.  May God bless you richly for your offerings to Him.

Furthermore, I want to reiterate out that this experiment has been a resounding success in terms of what it has done for this community.  The conversation has been exactly what the majority of us have aspired to, and our moderation has been minimal compared to any average week in the past.  This is a community we should all be glad to belong to.

I will be reverting /r/Christianity to its default settings, with a few exceptions.  The donation link will remain live for a few months so that newcomers to our page who were not aware of our drive or community members who were unable to give will have the opportunity.  The downvote arrows will continue to prompt donation.

As we close this week of giving, I want to bring up something that's been weighing on my heart lately.  Christ only requires of us the one thing we're unable to give of our own volition.  This is a totally radical notion, but I'm toying with the idea that it wasn't hyperbole. It was the rich young ruler's wealth.  It was the career of many a disciple.  He *commanded* people to hate their families, their reputations, their lifestyles, their homes.  Deny all things, He said; deny yourself.  When you do, you take up His cross.  Then - only then - are you truly free to follow Him.

Jesus paid it all. So let us offer up everything that we have to follow Christ.  Lay it all down before His throne - our talents for His use, our gifts for His Kingdom, and our sins for His forgiveness.  Let us give turn every bit of ourselves over to His service.  When we do, this $6,620 will be a drop in the bucket.

My response to this has been something along the lines of ""I cannot speak for them. I don't agree with them. Don't lump all Christians in with these people!"" To which I often received a reply that I was ""guilty by association"". I've thought about it and I think there may be something to this. If we as Christians only speak out against hatred in the name of our Lord when it is shoved in our face, then I don't think we're living up to the message of Christ. 

So, fellow Christians, let us right now make a declaration of love for our brothers and sisters in the homosexual community. This doesn't have to mean that you think homosexuality isn't a sin or anything like that, this is a declaration that homosexuals are just as worthy of the love and mercy of Christ as we are. That they are *not* deplorable, disgusting people and we do *not* support hatred and bigotry towards them. This is my declaration. If any of you feel like adding to this, please do. 

God bless. 

**Edit**: A couple of points I would like to clear up (as this became far more popular than I had expected), one is that this is not limited to the homosexual community. This is also extended to bisexuals, transgender, and any other sexual minority. Beyond that, this is also extended (as HawkieEyes pointed out) to the rest of humanity, gay or straight. Something else I would like to clear up is that when I say 

&gt; This doesn't have to mean that you think homosexuality isn't a sin or anything like that

that I am not personally condemning homosexuality as a sin. My personal opinion on it shouldn't really matter one way or the other. I actually left them out so as not to spur any needless debate and to keep focus on my original point. What I am saying is that whether you're more of a progressive Christian or a traditional Christian, we can all agree that calling for death is wrong and that it's time we say something about it. Again, I'm not trying to start a debate on homosexuality as this subreddit is full of them.

So I started digging around and I eventually found this post: (http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianityPolicy/comments/dvjo9/bans). 

While some of the bans appear legitimate, others seem very much at the whim of the mods. The post which moonflower was banned for merely describes her as an atheist who articulated the fact that atheists don't control other atheists. I find it disgusting if that was the only reason she was banned. 

Also, isn't the voting system the whole way that reddit works? If it doesn't add to a discussion, downvote! I understand that some people feel like r/atheism comes here in droves, but there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason behind the mods inchoate criteria of ""constructive.""

There was a comment that I think represents the opinion of many on this subreddit.

&gt;This is why this sub gets so much ridicule. This guy is straight up asking how to not sin from a CHRISTIAN perspective, and the top comment is telling him to continue sinning. This guy isn't here to debate homosexuality. He wants to follow the Bible and his heart has been convicted that God wants him to stop. 
This place is becoming straight up detrimental to Christians asking for Godly advice. I would really appreciate a Christian mod addressing this thread. This sub has basically become a place for people to deconvert Christians.
Sorry to get sidetracked OP, but if you truly have the heart to stop, I would suggest asking for prayer. As with all other sins, the best way to avoid falling into sin is to avoid whatever your first step to temptation is. Be aggressive in your prevention, and set strong boundaries for yourself. 
I would also say that homosexuality is an overblown topic, and that your sin is just as bad as heterosexual, premarital sex. Please don't add any unnecessary levels of disgust onto yourself. You are just a struggling sinner like the rest of us, and still extremely lovable in God's sight. Be thankful that He has convicted your heart on this patticular matter, and ask for grace in overcoming it. Good luck brother! 
edit: Looks like the comment was removed and is no longer the top comment. Thanks to whoever did it, that particular comment was just too much. I also shouldn't have specified ""Christian mod"" earlier, as I wouldn't be surprised if one of our atheist mods ended up deleting it.

In the thread there was no small amount of fellow Christians advising the young man to continue on the path that he already felt convicted to get off of. But, homosexuality is a hot topic in Christianity right now, so I'm sure many of you reading this may find no problem with that. That's fine, I'm not addressing that. Different opinions can and do exist.

However, there were many instances of people disputing what sin is and what sin isn't who don't even believe in sin or don't believe in Christ, telling OP that anyone who claims that a homosexual lifestyle is sin is a bigot, and trying to dissuade him from his Christianity.

Many of these posts were among the top voted comments.

I can point out rule 5 on the sidebar, which is supposed to represent the consensus of the community we have here, but I won't even go that far just yet. I just want to know, what is the point of a sub like Christianity if we can't even have fellow Christians come here to ask for advice that is encouraging and end up with people trying to talk them out of their faith? Aren't there subs for atheism and religious debates already? I don't mean just this specific example, these kinds of threads happen all the time. Open practically any random thread on this sub and you'll see examples of this.

I'm not saying we should ban alternative opinions or debates or anything like that. I'm not *saying* anything, I'm asking two questions.

- Why aren't we enforcing rule 5? Debates and dissents aren't just had, but there are people championing non-Christian agendas here. Anti-Christian, even. Why is this tolerated?

- What is the point of this sub if not a place for Christians to come together, encourage each other, and provide a loving, faithful community for each other? It's not that non-believers aren't allowed or even welcomed, but this is a place first and foremost for *Christians*. Why are some of the most passionate comments the ones trying to convert posters *away* from Christianity?

EDIT: Okay, some people clearly have not read this whole post. Everyone who's saying that my problem is with Christians who disagree on homosexuality, I'm going to quote a few sentences that I said towards the beginning of my post.

It was a local number, albeit unrecognized, so I answered it. 

An elderly voice was on the other end, and politely asked for 'Linda.'  I informed her no 'Linda' lived here, it was just me.  She asked me who I was and I told her my name, and apologized because I only recently got this phone number after switching from an Indiana to a Wisconsin phone number.  She sighed and said 'Okay, well my name is Tammy, how are you doing?""

I laughed and said I'm doing fine just winding down before bed.  She told me she's winding down as well, but sleeping doesn't help her, she's always tired.  When I asked why, she told me she had had a stroke in 2010 and been confined to a wheelchair.  We talked for a bit about how she's struggling to get used to life in a wheelchair and how it doesn't seem fair God would do this to her.  Then she apologized for talking so much but she doesn't have many friends to talk to.  I told her I wasn't bothered at all, and asked her about her sister, curious as to why she didn't have her new number. 

No joke, the next thing she said was, ""You have a very attractive voice for a black man.""

I laughed out loud and told her that I'm white.  She seemed shocked and asked me how old I was.

""I'm 27.""  She gave a long ""Oooooh, I'm 42, so you're only 5 years older than I am.""

""No no, I'm TWENTY seven.""

""TWENTY SEVEN?  WITH A BEAUTIFUL BLACK VOICE LIKE THAT?""

She seemed to break the tension with this, but immediately fell back into sullen talk.

""I've been looking for my someone.  I believe everyone has someone for them, but I don't know where mine is.""

I said, ""Well, my grandpa always told me 'You'll never find steak in a trashcan' when it comes to dating.

She responded, ""Justin, you tell me where to look, then.""

I asked her if she was religious, and she said she was but she was unable to go to church anymore because she couldn't drive, and she needed a wheelchair accessible van for her to be able to get there.

I asked her what church she used to go to, and she told me Mount Zion Baptist, in Madison.

I promised her first thing in the morning I would call Mt. Zion for her and try to figure out a way for her to attend church again.  She seemed taken aback by this and asked me if I was being sincere.

""Completely sincere."" I promised her. ""My word is my bond.""

She thanked me profusely and I managed to get off the phone with her shortly after that.

 

This morning I called the church for her and spoke with their Transportation department.  The woman listened to my story and told me they had a small van that has wheelchair access that can pick her up, so I gave them her name and phone number to call her.

30 minutes later I received another phone call from Tammy.  When I picked it up she was crying.  The Church had called her and scheduled her for sunday morning pick-ups, so she could attend church again.  She told me it was the best thing that's happened to her in weeks.  Then she said, ""I was done, and had given up.  It was too hard.  Thank you so much for helping me.""  I said absolutely, any time, and she hung up.

Although he wasn't a Christian, he quietly allowed me to finish.  After the prayer he said he was a Muslim.

I know Muslims believe in Jesus, but more like a prophet.  I tipped him $20 bucks; he said it changed his day around.  And I ended the conversation with ""There is a lot of animosity towards each of our religions, great we could get along, and share a moment.""  He agreed, saying this broke the Devils spell over him.  And, it was nice to bond with a stranger, both of us who were down on our luck.

""Mere Christianity"" will find this passage beneficial. 
This is from the chapter, ""The Rival Conceptions of God.""

If a good God made the world why has it gone wrong? 
And for many years I simply refused to listen to the Christian 
answers to this question, because I kept on feeling, ""whatever 
you say, and however clever your arguments are, isn't it much 
simpler and easier to say that the world was not made by any 
intelligent power?"" Aren't all your arguments simply a 
complicated attempt to avoid the obvious?"" But then that 
threw me back into another difficulty. 
    
My argument against God was that the universe 
seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea
 of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked 
unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I 
comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If 
the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, so 
to speak, why did I, who was supposed to be part of 
the show, find myself in such violent reaction against it? 
A man feels wet when he falls into water, because man 
is not a water animal: a fish would not feel wet. Of course 
I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was 
nothing but a private idea of my own. But if I did that, 
then my argument against God collapsed too - for the 
argument depended on saying that the world was really 
unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my 
private fancies. Thus in the very act of trying to prove 
that God did not exist  - in other words, that the whole 
of reality was senseless - I found I was forced to assume 
that one part of reality - namely my idea of justice - was 
full of sense. Consequently atheism turns out to be too 
simple. If the whole universe has no meaning: just as, if 
there were no light in the universe and therefore no 
creatures with eyes, we should never know it was dark. 
Dark would be without meaning.  ",,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,cma,True,t3_vmxpp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/vmxpp/cs_lewis_explains_why_he_converted_from_atheism/,

Let me give you some background. I was raised a Roman catholic, even though my father is an atheist, it was very easy for me to identify with Christianity. As a child, I would attend mass on my own and briefly joined the choir. Just before confirmation, my grandmother who had been like a mother to me passed. I was confirmed but with overwhelming doubt in my heart. Slowly I turned away from the church, religion and eventually God. A few years ago I began to tire of feeling angry all the time, angry at myself, at my father, the conditions in which I grew up, the church, the world. I carried a huge burden with me everywhere and it would manifest in rage or depression or feeling completely helpless. Since then, I’ve turned to Buddhist and Taoist teaching to help me cope and it has triggered an immense and very positive change in my life. I am no longer angry and now consider myself an atheist Buddhist. 

   Yesterday I went to my youngest brother's confirmation and something happened. Call it the holy spirit or whatever but when that holy water touched my forehead I just felt like I was home again. The same church I was confirmed in was calling me back. I miss the community, the love, the acceptance. I think it was just the right time for me. As I said, I’ve been thinking about God a lot these past months and I think I’m ready to let him in again. While standing at the back of the church I could feel myself trying to push god out of my mind. I like Catholicism, they accept evolution, generally accept gays(not gay btw), they allow you to reach God on your own terms. I don’t know what God is or what he wants and I think anyone who claims to, Pope included is delusional but I want to let him into my heart again. I think it was singing “One Bread, One Body” that really solidified it. “..And we, though many throughout the earth, we are one body in this one world” I’ve always believed this and even as an atheist I feel we are all connected.

   I’m going to attend mass this Sunday, my wife(Zen Buddhist) is all for it. I have a lot of confessing to do. I don’t know what I really expect to hear from you guys, encouragement, advice, support, I’m not sure what I’m after, I guess that’s the whole point. I’m still an atheist but I’m ready to return to the church. I hope I can start believing again. I hope you enjoyed my story; ask me anything, I would love to talk about it.

Many of us knew about Jessica before this post, while others are just now learning of her tenacious campaign to maintain the separation of church and state by seeking to have a religious banner removed from the auditorium at Cranston High School West.

This subreddit's robust discussion on Jessica's goal demonstrated how widely our individual views on the separation of church and state vary, in terms of what the phrase means, how it is (and how it has historically been) enacted in the United States, what the American Christian's response should be. As a global community, we expect a panoply of views. There is, however, one thing on which we are united, and we wish to state it as emphatically as possible.

**We categorically denounce the audacious and vitriolic responses from Christians as a result of Jessica winning her lawsuit. Those who have participated in the attempted character assassination of Jessica using social media represent the antithesis of one of the most profound teachings of Christ: ""A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.""**

Jessica, in spite of our divergent beliefs, we admire and support you.

We know that you would be just as strong and resolute without these few words - your arrival at this momentous occasion is evidence of that - but we would be remiss if we didn't take advantage of this opportunity to applaud your courage. [This letter originated with our community](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/ofedy/i_usually_lurk_but_today_ive_got_something_to_say/c3gsryk), and so **we invite our individual users to offer their message of encouragement to you below**.

On the one hand, people seem to get it here. You're super-nice to atheists, Muslims, or anybody else who expects to be downvoted for having a different viewpoint. It's almost cliche when I see the weekly post along the lines of, ""Thanks, /r/Christianity, I assumed you would all be jerks to me just because I'm an atheist, and instead you showered me with upvotes.""

But on the other hand, you people are assholes to each other. And I don't say assholes simply for the purpose of being incendiary. I'm saying it because you guys seriously treat each other like crap.

Whenever some other brand of ""Christian"" posts something that you don't like, it's an instant downvote. It's not that you're downvoting trolls, or people who are not contributing to the conversation. It really looks like some of you just automatically downvote anybody who has a particular denominational flair you don't like. It looks like others just downvote because they disagree with something, even though the point was well stated and somebody took the time to share it.

It's the same thing that's wrong with /r/atheism, with only one difference. Where the atheists break out the downvote brigade against Christians, you guys break out the downvote brigade against... other Christians.

And so I wanted to let you know how it looks to the casual, non-believing observer who looks past the fact that you're super-nice to non-believers, and wants to see how you actually treat each other. It tells me all I need to know, which is this: You'll be super nice to me as long as you're trying to recruit me, but once I join the club, I better fall in line or else you'll lash out with the only weapon you have at your disposal: the almighty downvote.

I honestly don't care what kind of votes this post gets because I'm done with this subreddit. But I wanted you to know that people notice how you treat each other. And it's the same in this subreddit as it is in real life: open hostility strictly because of different opinions WITHIN the ranks of Christianity. There is nothing different about you that I can see. There is nothing special about you that I can see.

I’ve been in churches all my life. When I was 13, right before going to church camp for the first time, I decided to dedicate my life to Jesus. That time, I did feel change, but after the camp, I quickly fell into my old ways, and as I grew older, I got into worse stuff, like pornography. In spite of that, I still totally believed in Jesus, and going to church was a highlight of my week. I was pretty much a Sunday and Wednesday Christian, although, if confronted, I was very vocal about my faith. 

When I got to college, I started questioning my faith, and after reading books like The God Delusion, God is Not Great, and The End of Faith, I became an atheist. Some of that also came from finding reddit and r/atheism, but I really don't blame them so much. Anywho, over time, as I got more and more into a/antitheism, things in my life started falling apart. My grades sank, my friendships suffered, and I ended up becoming clinically depressed, although I didn't realize that until after I effectively flunked out of that college. 

After I got home from college with a terrible GPA, my parents realized that something was wrong, and while I never did tell them about my atheism, I think they suspected something like that. My dad suggested that I look into transferring into Liberty University, and I did end up transferring into there/here. 

After deciding to come to Liberty mostly for the accountability here, I started to relook at the evidence for Christianity, stuff like the historicity of Christ and whether evolution and Christianity could reconcile. For most of the summer now, I've been either doing that or working on transfer stuff.

Either way, last week, I had pretty much come to the decision that if evolution did not disprove original sin, then that explains origins well enough, and Jesus answers the why of the Moral Law. Last week was also Spiritual Emphasis Week here, and the pastor preached about Who We Are in Christ, explaining a lot of other stuff as well. 

So yesterday, as I was preparing to write a paper for my Evangelism 101 class titled ""Why I am not a Christian,"" I realized I really had no more reasons to not be a Christian. Since I wasn't sure how I was going to write my paper anymore, I decided to go on to the next assignment for that class, which was a quiz on a chapter of one of the texts for the class. Said chapter happened to be about how to get saved. After reading the chapter, I decided to give my life back to the Lord since I had jumped out of his hands years ago and been running as far away from him as I could. 

Also, I did end up getting to do my paper since the ""Why I am not a Christian"" one was just the one that non-Christians were supposed to write. Christians were supposed to write their testimony for the assignment, albeit in only one page, which is shorter than this.

I am going  to be leaving to see him at noon. I need you to help pray for my strength and let me be slow to anger.

**Edit!! **I am back home, safe and sound.** Sound part, definite--him, maybe not so much. I really want to thank each and every one of you for the prayers poured out to me. I remained calm even when he was yelling at me. At first it was a little hard to start talking but once I did, I was on a roll. He wouldn't look at me while I was talking, he just looked at mail and outside the window. Said ""whatever"" to mostly everything I said he did wrong.  He said somethings that were pretty messed up about my mom, and how I was born/came to be, I'm an ""accident"" but I'm going to be okay, no big deal, that's old news. I just thought it was interesting that he would try to throw that in my face to try and hurt me.   He kept on telling me that I wasn't abused but that I was disciplined, yeah right. 
 He did apologize, not exactly sincere. He told me to get the hell over it.  Told me to leave his house because I was ""disrespecting him"", I did no such thing, I spoke politely and calmly--granted I cried a bit, but I told him what he didn't want to hear. He still wanted to hold on his stupid fantasy of him being void from sin and he didn't do anything wrong.  No he didn't hit me, yes I am okay. I don't know where this is going to leave us, but he kind of did soften up at the end. I think he might have had a tear in his eye, weird.  Anyways thanks for reading to my spiel, and thank you to each and every single one of you for your kind words, concerns, thoughts and prayers.

We sat and talked all night. I showed him what i wrote and he thought on it. we prayed like i never have before. He comforted me so much.

I was struck with love. I had tons of strangers just telling me they loved me, people i never meet before. I was dumbfounded.

Well I got the call today but it didn't go at all how I thought it would. 

They called and said that I didn't get the job I applied for. I was devastated and heartbroken. But then they said, and I quote, ""We liked you so much we're gonna hire you on contract and then transition you to full time if you like it here"". My jaw dropped. I couldn't believe that I would get that compliment from them and I feel so honored that they would even say that.

What makes this a double answer to prayer is how pathetic I've been feeling lately. I've cried to God and told him how sad I am that, even though I'm qualified for so many jobs, I don't get any job offers. It was starting to really affect my mental state and I was bordering on depression. When I was told that they like me so much that they created a contract job just so that I could work there, well, I felt so alive and fulfilled inside. 

I can't describe how amazing I feel right now. I know this isn't exactly what I wanted but it's exactly what God wanted. God is good, y'all. It's just He shows it in His time and not ours.

Something amazing happened,Thaddeus_Griffin,770,255,316,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/w12vn/today_something_amazing_happened/,"This morning, around 5 AM, I woke up and couldn't fall back asleep. I didn't have anything to do all day, so it wasn't a big deal waking up so early, so I decided it might be fun to go for a hike in the mountains behind my house. So I packed a lunch up, grabbed some water, and I did something I hadn't done before on my previous hikes... I grabbed my bible. I don't know why, but something told me I should. As I was going up my typical path, something seemed bland about it, it was just too normal, so I decided to veer off.

As I wandered through, I found a different path. This one was strange, it was beaten up, it looked like it hadn't been used in ages, and almost seemed to go nowhere.

I was walking through the path, and it was hard, there were rocks everywhere, dips, twists, turns, but eventually this seemingly endless mess opened up at the top of one of the mountains, on an awesome cliff overlooking the entire area I live in. I sat down, ate my breakfast/lunch, drank my water, and watched the sun as it slowly started to encompass the whole land.

When I finally opened my bible, I just started flipping through, reading random verses, until I eventually stumbled upon one that stuck out all too perfectly. I don't remember the exact verse, as I was too overwhelmed by all that was going on to pay much attention, but the verse talked about how in life we go through twists and turns, we fall, we get hurt, we even lose our way, but in the end, it all leads to God.

After reading that verse, it all was made clear. The path I took WAS my life, and to that point I had gone through all kinds of twists and turns, I've fallen, I've struggled to get up, I've lost my way. And I now know it all leads to the beautiful picture I beheld at the top of the mountain. Overcome with emotion at that point, I teared up, bent my head, and began to pray. And for the first time I didn't pray for forgiveness, I didn't pray for guidance or direction, I prayed to give thanks. Because for the first time, I actually feel as if I am going somewhere in my life.

I've been lost for so long, I've fallen so much, but I know, with God, I will rise and stand again.

Throughout most of my life church was everything. My parents used to be those super religious types you hear about so often (borderline Westboro). We literally lived at a church for awhile. Even after we moved we still pretty much lived at church. We attended some type of church gathering almost every day of the week. Basically what I am saying is church was my life.

Don't get me wrong, I loved it. I wasn't just one of those ""going through the motions"" types. I was involved. I was that kid who brought his Bible to school. I prayed every night. I tried to have a relationship with God. 

Eventually it became too much. I've had some experiences that I'd rather not talk about right now that destroyed my faith. Ever since I've been lost. I just don't know what to do with my life anymore. Everything seems so pointless without God but I can't go back. I've tried to force myself to believe. I've tried praying, asking, begging, for some answers but nothing works. I'm just so confused and empty. 

That brings us here. This is pretty much a last ditch plea for help. I need some support on this and I have nowhere else to go. All the churches near me have a strong ""no homosexuality"" stance so talking to anyone there would just be a waste of time. 

It took me way too long to write this. I broke down and burst into tears more than once. I don't know what exactly I'm looking for. Just please, knowing that I'll have someone somewhere praying for me will make all the difference. Thank you for your time. 

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone who is reaching out to me. I'm not sure what I believe but I do know that I appreciate all the help I've been getting.

I told myself I Would only follow there path of fighting for our community and Religion if God himself asked me too.

I never heard anything back and my family laughed at me for asking something from above like an actual and real voice.

In college I was still very Desperate to have God in my life. But I came to the conclusion God isn't real, and if he was, He had no interest in talking to me.

I made new friends at College met with some amazing people who were Christians. They opened the door to other ways of communicating to God.

I went to there Bible Studies, Argued with them about God, Why and how the Bible could be fake. 

After many years of searching, I found Jesus... He came to me in a Vision. He promised if I were to follow him he would guide me in this life and the next. I haven't looked back since...

He has done some amazing miraculous things in my life. I can't thank him enough.

I also like to thank you guys here as well for opening the Door and educating me on many different topics and why Jesus is the only way!

Around 11 I called my dad. He was doped out of his mind on morphine. He told me things are not good and kept saying I love you. My phone cut out before I could say it back. Then when I began to leave to see him I got a call from the nurse saying he had passed. Now I don't know what to do now. God better exist, because I want to see my dad again. 

Please pray for me.

She was going to go with a church mission team to teach in South Africa. However, the church informed her that she can no longer go because they had found out she believed evolution is real.

This acquaintance immediately said,""Good for the church, we don't need people teaching more garbage to children!"" I was very surprised and explained that I also believe evolution is true and that it can work with what the Bible says. She looked me right in the eye and said, ""I am very sorry you believe in that crap. I'll pray that the Holy Spirit helps you find the truth.""

I just can't believe it's still a debate. She said that the Bible doesn't say anything about evolution so it's not true. I then asked her if she believed gravity was real, because the Bible says nothing about it. She insisted it was different, although couldn't tell me how...

But I dont share this view. Does that need to be a problem? Not really. If we were to be loving and truly tolerant community we would accept everyone, including those who aren't 'pro-gay'. Instead I get down voted to infinity as if my opinion is not even allowed. I don't go down voting people who are liberal or those who even doubt major biblical notions, instead I understand that different people have different opinions and whether I agree or not, I'm going to show them and their opinion love, rather than cutting it down with a down vote.2) Christ's reflectionI simply don't see Christ reflected in this group. Why is their no discussion of social aid? Why are there no campaigns for real change in treatment of asylum seekers and refugees? We need more of this and less 'lets discuss homosexuality...again...and again'.3) StereotypesMy complaints do revolve around homosexuality and the related discussions and people's views, but an absolute low was being called by a fellow brother in Christ a homophobe and a bigot. Why? Because I explained how I think homosexual acts are not holy. I didn't say they're devil worship or like homosexual desires are sinful or perverted. I just don't think they should have sexual relations like other non-married couples. I also found this offensive with a gay sister. I love her but don't agree with that lifestyle. But being labeled as a 'gay hater' I just find insulting and not Christian at all.I love the posts where I learn heaps about the pope and social change and aid and stats and much more, but this intolerance of different opinion is making this place hard to feel a part of.",,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,,True,t3_19glmp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/19glmp/why_im_leaving_rchristianity/,

1339511198.0,477,self.Christianity,uxymn,I am a Christian and a scientist. AMA.,klenow,610,133,838,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/uxymn/i_am_a_christian_and_a_scientist_ama/,"Good morning! I volunteered to do an AMA on being a Christian and a scientist. Just a bit of background first:

Christian life: I was raised as a Christian in the southern US. I currently attend a small (~80 members) fairly new (just over a year old) church in the southern United States. I have attended a variety of churches through the years, ranging from old-school Presbyterian, to Episcopalian, to evangelical near-megachurch (~4000 members). I even spent a few years as an agnostic/atheist. My calling in the church is to work with youth and the underprivileged, and I try to do both as best I can. 


As for my scientific work, I am a postdoc at a major research university. I have a PhD in biochemistry and have worked primarily in lung diseases. Currently, I study host-pathogen interactions and pathogenogenesis (how benign environmental bacteria become pathogens). If you want to know about my research, I did an [AMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceAMA/comments/i0dse/i_study_the_role_of_infection_in_chronic_lung/) on that about a year ago. Read over that to get an idea, but feel free to ask science stuff as well. Just don't get upset if I talk your ear off....


And just to cover what I am fairly certain will get asked:


1) Evolution : It happened.  We don't have all the mechanics of it worked out yet and we won't for a while still, but it happened. It's just filling in the gaps now. Any new idea that displaces evolution would have some big holes to cover. The evidence is wide-ranging and HUGE. You see its footprints everywhere. It's ubiquitous, and the more you get into biology the more absurd it seems to deny it. It would be like standing in a downpour and insisting it's a sunny day. I see intelligent design as a valid *philosphical and theological reconciliation* of the Bible and the data behind evolution. ID is not a science, though. It makes no predictions and cannot be tested. 


2) Faith vs Evidence - Gould's concept of ""Non-Overlapping Magisteria"" is a good starting point for my thoughts on this, but it's just a starting point. Basically, the Bible tells us that faith is ""assurance about what we do not see."" In science, evidence is what we can see or detect (and I use the word ""see"" in the loosest possible context, bordering on metaphorical). Since faith is exclusively what we cannot see and science is based exclusively on what we can see, the two cannot possibly overlap. If you have no evidence, science says nothing about it. If you have evidence, it is outside the realm of faith. Yes, Occam's Razor. I know. We are to take the simplest model to account for what we see; but I'm talking about things we don't see. This is what Ockham himself believed (remember, he was a Franciscan friar). The Razor is a tool of logic, but since belief in God is not based on logic or proof, the Razor doesn't apply. Yes, I am saying that logic and observation don't apply specifically to things that are not obseravable. If you have no data in a certain region all you can do is extrapolate, and extrapolation is generally a good way to get into trouble.


That's not to say those topics are off limits....that's just a starting point.


I'll be off and on all day; I planned to do this today because I have a lot of 30 minute gaps in my protocols. So I'll be around for about half an hour and then gone for an hour or so, then back all day. So if I take a while, I apologize. I will do my best to answer everything as best I can.

EDIT : I hope you're all happy now. Because of your intriguing and fun to answer questions, I have lost track of time and my bacterial cultures have overgrown to the point that I have to respike them and do the infection tomorrow. On the other hand, I think the mice are throwing a party in your honor for their hiatus. This is fun, I love it that I'm not getting the ""standard stuff"" I feared I'd get. This community does NOT disappoint! Keep it coming!

EDIT 3: WOW. Just .... wow. The less creative trolls are coming out in the night, things are getting less meaty more rotten meaty, and I am exhausted. It's been a long day in many ways....my last lead compound turned out to be toxic, which is bad news. I'm headed to bed now. If I ignored your post, please repost it, I know I missed a ton. I've got a few I left to look at tomorrow, I'm in no condition to give anything proper attention right now. And if you got a snarky or nonsensical replay from me in the past half hour or so, please accept my apologies. I'm tired. I'll do my best to wrap it up tomorrow though.



EDIT 2: My head...it burns....I have to take a break guys, I'll try to get to your questions later but I have to take a break for now. Man, this has been WAY too much FUN! Even the trolls, you're creative! I love it! No low-hanging fruit for you!

1358268670.0,472,self.Christianity,16mimx,I'm a Christian who condones state-sanctioned homosexual marriages.  I believe biblically this is the most sound position.,ToldYoMama2VoteObama,756,284,883,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/16mimx/im_a_christian_who_condones_statesanctioned/,"The purpose of this post is to provide a biblical basis for condoning state-sanctioned homosexual marriages.

Case A: Homosexuality is not a sin.  If this is the case then there's really no reason to forbid state-sanctioned homosexual marriages.

Case B: Homosexuality is a sin.  This is the trickier case.  I will spend the remainder of this post assuming this is the case.  I will defend the assertion that the Biblical position is still to permit state-sanctioned homosexual marriages.

First of all note that I've consistently said state-sanctioned, not church-sanctioned.  If homosexuality is a sin the body of Christ should not condone it.  Therefore if homosexual marriage is to be permitted, it must be within a secular context - state-sanctioned.  So let's look at God and Jesus and how they treat the commands they gave:

[1] God the Father:

[1A] *Adam and Eve had free will*.  By ""free will"" I mean that if one knew all previous states of the universe (both physical and metaphysical) one could not predict the choice a free will would make and that all choices that can be logically formulated are available.  The first aspect - predictability - is necessary to make God not responsible for Adam and Eve's sinful actions.  Sure God knew what they were going to do, but since their actions were not the result of cause and effect (cause and effect requires predictability), then God did not ""cause"" them to commit sin.  The second aspect - all choices being available - is necessary to make it so God allowed the option to do any sort of good in lieu of evil (i.e. God didn't ""rig the system"" to make them choose among sin; they could have freely chosen to not sin).

[1B] *God respected Adam and Eve's free will enough to let them choose their own deaths and the deaths of other people.*

[1C] *If we are to model our behavior after what God does, then we, too, should allow people to exercise their wills, today, even if it means their own demise. (Whether or not their wills are free in the same way that Adam and Eve's were is irrelevant.)*

[2] Jesus:

[2A] *Though Jesus gave commands, He did not seek to change secular society so as to enforce either His commands or the OT commands.*

[2B] *If we are to be imitators of Christ, then we should not force people to follow the commands in the Bible via secular government.*

Thoughts?  

(On a side note, the Biblical definition of marriage is not merely one-man-one-woman.  If the definition of marriage includes a notion of one-man-one-woman, then it is one-man-one-woman-for-life.  If you wish to oppose state-sanctioned gay marriage, then you should equally oppose divorce and be actively seeking to disallow it.)",,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,reformed,True,t3_16mimx,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/16mimx/im_a_christian_who_condones_statesanctioned/,

I've always had a problem with Christianity being presented as a ""billboard"" religion and think that St. Patrick's approach was the best (he integrated himself into the culture, came to know the people, then started talking about Christianity). I especially have a problem with the message of, to put it bluntly, ""convert or be damned."" This presents Christianity as an altogether exclusive religion, when in reality it should be presented as a free and open religion. 

I'm not denying that those who do not believe won't be saved. What I think is that that is not the core message of Christianity. The core message is one of love and forgiveness and if it's going to be presented on a billboard, that is the message that should be presented.

But as with the quote, I am not a fan of billboard evangelism. I don't think it is an effective method of bringing others to Christ. Not to say we should sit idly by and wait for people to come to us with questions about faith...rather than create the message, I think we should create an environment in which non-believers inquire about Christ.

Maybe I'm completely off on this and am just ranting. What are your thoughts, r/Christianity?

In my mind, this is what the subreddit is for: Christians to be Christians, and others to observe and ask questions.

So, I expect prayer requests, whats-your-favorite-bible-verse threads, thank you from an atheist, and Why do Christians x? 

What I see instead is Christians taking Christianity apart while atheists and others cheer them on.

Since I've come here, I've seen these viewpoints paraded, sometimes it almost seems aggressively so:

Nothing is sinful about homosexuality

Nothing is sinful if it doesn't hurt anyone

The bible is NOT inerrant

The Bible is not divinely inspired

The Bible is not relevant

Paul is wrong

Creationism is impossible

The idea that anything with God could even BE impossible

Works are required for salvation

No one is going to hell/forever

Christians shouldn't be set apart

Nothing is wrong with atheism


I could go on.  I understand that just because i individually take issue with these it doesnt make them wrong.  My point is this-I expect Christians to have a backbone.  I get that most of you are not as conservative as my background of Christians.  I understand that you are accepting, and that is good.  No one is going to come to Jesus if we push everyone away yelling about how hot they're gonna burn.

I just think maybe we lean a *little* too far in the opposite direction.  Im afraid no one is going to come to Jesus reading this sub because the way you talk makes Him sound unimportant.  Honest, I've heard arguments deconstructing every unique thing about Christianity-from Christians! 

You might say, ""The point is not to convert people/bring people to Christ"".  That's where you're just plain wrong.  That's always the point.  It maybe the subtext.  It maybe a process, it maybe that being overt about it is a bad move-but it needs to be there.

And we are called to be a light on a hill.  All I see in this sub are people so in the world, they forgot that it is not their home.

At it's core, this book is the revelation (singular) of Jesus Christ. He is the main character in this saga. That's why the title of the book is Revelation (singular) instead of Revelations (plural).

There has been an uptick in users coming here to harass Christians, to ""challenge their faith,"" to harass those who seek prayer from others, or who come here asking advice of other Christians. 

This has to stop.

If you want to do those things there are already plenty of subreddits in which you can do that. This one isn't here for that. It doesn't matter how you experience things in your daily life so far as your behavior here is. You aren't the only person who has bad days or feels marginalized and you do not deserve a unique right to harass and belittle others.

There is no good reason why submissions where a person is concerned about a sick relative are met by people with chips on their shoulders. There is no good reason why when people seek advice from other Christians with similar struggles they are again met by people with chips on their shoulders. If there is a submission posing a question here, assume it is a question for Christians unless it is specifically stated otherwise. If someone is having a difficult time in trying to avoid pornography and you decide that you should make that struggle more difficult you are no longer welcome here. If your contribution here amounts to nothing more than suggesting that Christians stop being Christian, go away.

Allow me to be perfectly clear:

This subreddit exists ***primarily*** for discussions about Christianity by Christians though we welcome most general conversations about Christianity by anyone.

I don't know if people thought these things were OK to do here but they are not. Subverting conversations, attacking people, attacking Christianity, flaunting the community policy, kicking people while they are down, hiding behind accusations of hypocrisy as though it was a defense of your own abysmal behavior are all things which can no longer be ignored and brushed away. Moderation will increase, and has, to match these issues.

We are currently drafting a new community policy and there will be an increase in moderation. If we need more moderators we will add more moderators. What you can do to help is to use the report button, message us if it seems there is some urgency to it, upvote good comments and downvote bad comments. In fact doing these things is much more effective than writing posts about how mods aren't doing anything. We can not bear all of the responsibility for keeping this subreddit usable. To keep it functioning there has to be a synergy between moderators and regular subscribers.

We are open to ideas and may implement some and not implement others. If there are any better ideas on how to address these issues we are all ears. However pretending these issues don't exist or ignoring them can not be one.

Examples of the sorts of posts which there can be no more tolerance or blind-eyes for will follow. Almost exclusively these are from within the past 36-48 hours and importantly this is a small portion of the sorts of posts which could have been given:

And a followup story: hypocritical Christians recognize the flaws of man yet still believe a book written by men 2000 years ago is somehow true without any evidence to support it. Why? Because fuck logic.
*******************************************
We know that God didn't create the world according to the bible. So it is ridiculous to claim the bible got it right. This is just 1 out of thousands of claims that by all means are ridiculous. Instead of banning your belief we are just going to mock the insanity of it.

He was the kind of man that made you put up instant warning signs- he would come up to you during coffee, and both ask about and share personal details too quickly in the conversation, then spontaneously begin praying with you.  I know that doesn't sound too bad to some, but if you've ever experienced something like this, you know what I mean.  We, on council, soon learned that he has been asked to leave several churches- not only because of his penchant for the above, but also he had a number of borderline inappropriate interactions with children (coming up to them by himself while they were playing, talking to them, putting on their coats for them outside if he thought they were too cold, etc.).  Again, perhaps not weird to some, but it was a pattern.  He was also known to police- no arrests or charges, but numerous complaints from the community (an officer was on council).  

Our church (pastor and council) took very deliberate steps to talk to this man, and set up expectations for his behaviour, explaining that he was more than welcome within the church (he was added to one of the small group bible studies, pastoral care group), but he was also expected to act in a certain way.  This seemed reasonable to him (though he claimed to really not understand what all the fuss was about), and he participated in our church for 2 years.  

On Friday, unexpectedly and in his sleep, he passed away.  

John was not an easy man to like.  He lacked a social understanding that made conversation with him difficult.  As a parent, he always made me feel uncomfortable.  However, I am so glad that he was able to find a place within our church, both the walls and the community.

One of the things we have to do for this course is visit places of worship of different religions during their worship times. Last night two guys friends and I (a female) visited a Mosque for Friday night prayer.

We ended up going to the Arabic service instead of the English service on accident, but that ended up being okay. Two men came out of the service and escorted my male friends into the prayer room and escorted me up to the woman's area via elevator.

There were at least 40 men who were attending the service. I was expecting about the same amount of women. There were only two, a middle aged woman and an older woman with her very tiny granddaughter.

Two women sitting in the large room watching a TV of the man speaking downstairs. 

The older woman asked me to sit right next to her and that moment I knew everything was going to be okay. She had very broken English as she was Arabic, but she did her best to kindly explain to me what a Muslim believed about God. She did not force anything on me. She was so kind about it. Later she asked me what I believed and I hesitated. I told her I was a Christian and was expecting her to flinch, but instead she smiled and said something along the lines of that it was a good thing that I had such faith, and that she was happy that I came to the Mosque even though I am Christian. 

She continued to tell me more things about Islam and why women wore headscarves and things like that (I decided to wear a headscarf to the service because I wasn't sure if I would offend anyone by not wearing one). When it was time for me to go, she held my hand and told me how happy she was to have met me. She gave me the most sincere hug, kissed me on the cheeks, and told me that she loved me like her own daughter and that she hoped to see me again someday.

That was the first time I have ever felt so loved by a complete stranger. I didn't catch her name, and I'm sad about that, but God knows who she is and I can continue to pray for her. 

I'm working on reconciling some broken friendships now. I haven't been showing people the love that they deserve and that woman last night opened my eyes to that.

It could be the spectacle of talking to one of the people on the other side of the fence, an interest in the culture, comfort in the traditions of your childhood, or any other reason. I know a lot of people would agree with me when I say that [/r/christianity](/r/christianity) is one of the best religious subreddits. However, and I hate to spoil the fun, our interactions are making our hosts weary of our presence.

I have noticed a recent dramatic upswing (recent being with in the last few weeks) of rudeness, pedantic bickering, and debate when no debate was asked for. If we want our presence here to be welcomed, we must start being more civil. If you don't want your presence to be welcomed here, then you are doing it wrong. 

What I am suggesting is a loose code of conduct. Nothing like a law or a command, but a guideline so we can communicate more effectively with our Christian brothers and sisters. 

1. Don't try and pick apart people's declarations of faith. Once upon a time, I was this [asshole](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/qs679/an_answered_prayer_and_an_end_to_confusion_god_is/c400bdm). The moral of the story? Any person might be wrong in your eyes, but there is a time and place for everything. Please be prudent.

2. Please be polite, I know this is not a huge problem, but there is always a chance for rudeness with the high tension that the conflicting ideals posses. 

3. Do not try and begin debates. If you are curious, ask a question. If you want a debate, there is [/r/debatereligion](/r/debatereligion), which I thoroughly enjoy.

As a former Atheist who recently gave his life to Christ, I just want to put it out there that the biggest thing that was keeping me from accepting the Gospel and Jesus Christ was Christians. There are always exceptions, but generally speaking, so many Christians view themselves higher than non-believers and have no humility at all. They are saved and you are not is the sense you get from them. But in comparison, they are no better than you, and sometimes are worse than you compared to societal standards. Looking at a Christian who is no better than you, but yet has a mentality or attitude that they are completely turns people off to Christ. So I urge Christians to humble themselves, and take a serious look at Jesus and his treatment of people. He hung out with the most wicked, the people that society looked down upon. He was humble and didn't put himself above anyone. If unconditional, Christ-like love was shown to me by the Christians around me, I'm sure I would have given my life to Jesus Christ sooner than I did.

His parents tried everything from tutors to hypnosis, but to no avail. Finally, at the insistence of a family friend, they decided to enroll their son in a private Catholic school.

After the first day, the boy's parents were surprised when he walked in after school with a stern, focused and very determined expression on his face, and went right past them straight to his room, where he quietly closed the door. For nearly two hours he toiled away in his room - with math books strewn about his desk and the surrounding floor. He emerged long enough to eat, and after quickly cleaning his plate, went straight back to his room, closed the door, and worked feverishly at his studies until bedtime.

This pattern continued ceaselessly until it was time for the first quarter report card. The boy walked in with his report card -- unopened -- laid it on the dinnertable and went straight to his room. Cautiously, his mother opened it, and to her amazement, she saw a bright red ""A"" under the subject of MATH.

Overjoyed, she and her husband rushed into their son's room, thrilled at his remarkable progress. ""Was it the nuns that did it?,"" the father asked. The boy only shook his head and said, ""No."" ""Was it the one-on-one tutoring? The peer-mentoring?"" ""No."" ""The textbooks? The teachers? The curriculum?""

I know I was foolish, but there's still one odd thing that nags me...",misterbeaver,544,121,513,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/11rdst/i_just_got_swindled_for_1600_by_a_man_who/,"I work for an average, aging, evangelical church.  Every day, we get calls from people who are looking for assistance with their rent, people who just want someone to talk to for a few minutes, and even a few who are interested in ""turning their lives around"" and ""accepting Jesus into their lives.""  As many of you who work for churches can attest, these calls can become a little overwhelming at times, and you sadly become numb to saying ""no, there's nothing we can do for you"" over and over again.

Every once in a while, though, you get a call and you find yourself talking with someone who you sense could really use a kind word and a friendly bit of encouragement.  Well, or so you think.

""What do I need to do to be saved?""

It was the first thing this guy said to me.  No ""hello"", no ""my name is..."", just simply, ""What do I need to do to be saved?""

I tried to explain to him what I thought salvation meant, and over the next hour we talked about what I felt one must do to live a truly full life, set free by the grace of God.  He asked me question after question, and finally he asked, ""Could you find me someone who would be willing to sit down with me and a few Bibles to talk about what this all means?""

""Of course,"" I said, ""I could meet you somewhere in around an hour.""

So I met this man, this stranger, in front of a Barnes and Noble.  We sat down, and he began to ask me even more questions about my faith.  He asked me about my own life, my own faith journey.  He asked me if I ever sinned, and for some reason (which I now see is probably the product of a professional scam artist) even began to confess things to him that I had never said out loud before.  It was... so freeing to admit all of the things that I had been holding so closely to my chest, and I felt a sense of peace and relief.  I was fortunate to have met this man, even briefly.  But then he asked me to turn to Matthew 5:38-43:

*“You have heard that it was said, ‘Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.’ But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to them the other cheek also. And if anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, hand over your coat as well. If anyone forces you to go one mile, go with them two miles. Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.*

I read it aloud, and he asked, ""Would you be willing to do any of this for your faith?""

""I would,"" I replied.  ""I'd like to think so, anyway.""

And for the next hour, he continued to question my resolve.  Do I worship money, or do I worship God?  Would I still believe in God if I had no money?  Would I curse him if I found that I had lost it all?  Would I really give to others who asked, offering my cloak and coat, both?  Yes, yes, yes, I kept saying.  I worship God, not mammon.

Finally he said, ""Prove it.  Give me your debit card.""

Now, looking back, I know that what I did was stupid.  It was foolish.  I don't know what I was thinking, or how I could have been so irrational, but the only thing that I can figure now is that he, this guy pretending to be interested in salvation, had led me to the natural conclusion that I really needed to be more free with my money.

So I gave him my debit card.  I slid it across the table.  

He chuckled and slid it back to me.  ""I don't want your money, pastor.  I just wanted to see if you're sincere.  To see if you meant what you said.""

He'd ask me to do the same thing over and over, each time escalating it another step.  I see now that it was a gradual building of trust, something that he worked up to, but I finally found myself withdrawing $1,600 from my account (all I have, really) and physically handing him the money.  (""I don't want your debit card, pastor, but if you really believed in all of this, you'd hand over the cold hard cash."" ).  I handed him the envelope, and he looked at me and said, ""Do you trust me to borrow this for half an hour?""

And I (yes, I know how stupid this is) said, ""Yes, yes I do.""

""Are you scared, pastor?"" he said.

""I'm trying hard not to be,"" I said.

""Don't worry, Pastor,"" he said with a wink, ""Nothing bad is going to happen to you while you're in the hand of God.""

And he left.

That was the last I saw of that money.

There isn't a lot I can do at this point.  The police are coming to collect a report, and I'll provide them with what limited information I have, but I doubt they'll find the guy.  And even if they do, I handed him my money freely, so there really wasn't a crime committed, I suppose.

I don't honestly know how this man got me to the point that I'd hand him all I had.  I was obviously dealing with someone who knew how to manipulate people, to turn their words on themselves, and I will admit that I was completely outsmarted.  To be completely frank, I really thought I might be dealing with something divine -- something ordained by God to happen.

I know I was a fool, that I made a terrible decision, and that I am going to have to live with the consequences.  I sense that I don't quite fully understand the implications that this moment of insanity will cost me in the long run, and I am sad that I was taken advantage of.

Still, even in the moments after I realized that I was never going to see my money again, I realized that I wasn't angry at this guy.  I wasn't furious that he had taken all of my money (or convinced me to give it to him).  Somehow, in all of the conversation that we had had that afternoon, about sin and forgiveness, Christian generosity and the importance of money... I found myself with a strange sense of peace and forgiveness towards that man.  I took time to pull over and pray for him, to pray that this man somehow free himself from the greed that led him to take advantage of me.  

I went home and told my wife about what I had done.  I admitted that I had drained our bank account and given the money away.  She was understandably furious with me.  How could I do such an irresponsible, stupid thing?  We have a child on the way, and I would choose to spend the money on something so vain?  We talked for quite some time.  There were tears, there was shame, and there were moments of honesty shared between us that we hadn't had in long time.

But, in the end, she forgave me.  We laughed a little about it (""I wish you would have at least irresponsibly spent that money on me,"" she quipped.), and watched television in one anothers' arms.  

More than anger, more than aggression, more than anything else, I feel pity for the man that conned me.

That man makes a part of his living by manipulating and alienating others for his own benefit.  He knowingly hurts others, which seems so much like a life committed to something other than, well, life.  It's difficult to believe, but I pity him, because he is so obviously missing something from his life.  I will suffer for quite some time because of my decision, but I still have things that moth and rust can't destroy.  I have a wife that loves me in spite of the stupid things I (regularly) do, a baby on the way, a job that allows me to build people up and connect them with God, and a peace that passes even my own net worth.  Looking back, I truly believe that God caused this to happen.  Not to punish me or anything (although that might easily be the case), but I'd like to think that the experience was a reminder that there is more to life than money and distrust.  

""Are you happy, pastor?"" the man asked at one point in our conversation.

""I really think so,"" I said.  

""Why?""

""I don't know,"" I replied, ""I just... am.  I have so much to be thankful for, so much to love about my life, I suppose.""

He reached for the Bible I had brought for our conversation.  ""Pastor, can I have this?""

""You can,"" I said, ""but, here, take mine.  It's a slightly more understandable translation.""

He took my money away, tucked away in that Bible.  I hope and pray that he benefits from both.  

I know that this won't be read by many (or any) in this obscure subreddit, but I wanted to share how God has worked in my life, lately.

Tl;dr -- I was a fool, but strangely have peace over it.

Peace be with you all.

I figured I'd share my experience.,newchristian,518,105,282,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/zwowt/over_the_course_of_the_last_month_i_converted_to/,"I was raised in a non-religious household. I was never taught anything about religion except that it was something that some people were in to, and that it was a little kooky. Other than that thought I really had little to no exposure to it.

In my teenage years I started to become interested in The Big Questions  (life, the universe, everything) and read as much as I could about science, history, philosophy, and theology. This insatiable desire for knowledge is a habit I keep to this day.

I took first to a sort of agnosticism, and later to atheism, as they seemed the most logical positions. I remained an atheist for the next 15 years. However, I always had this tiny little inkling at the back of my skull that atheism just wasn't right. I convinced myself that this was due to cultural contamination, or fear of the unknown, or my own intellectual weakness, and I did a damn good job of mentioning it to no one for the better part of two decades.

Life went on and I continued my self directed study. As I learned more and more about more advanced topics I started to realize that the universe was not nearly as simple and straightforward as I'd supposed. 

The tipping point for me came when I realized that I had an essentially binary choice in competing explanations for the physical constants of nature: a multiverse, or God. My selection came down, as it often does to WWOD (What Would Occam Do?) Which is the simpler proposition? A single God outside the universe? Or an infinite number of universes outside the universe, all contained in some unknown and itself infinite multidimensional metaverse. God seemed the more economical choice.

I'd reasoned my way to an openness to the possibility of God, but that isn't the same thing as faith. I still had one more step to take before going from ""open to God"" to ""Faith in God.""

With my new found openness (that a Christian may have deemed ""having an open heart"") I said to God ""I am ready to accept you, if you are there. I want to experience you, to know you, if you are there. I want to have a spiritual experience, and if you are there, and if you see fit to grant one to me, I will accept it, and you, regardless of what challenges that may bring."" I fully expected nothing to happen and to go on as a newly minted agnostic, but I was truthful in saying I would accept it if I did have a subjective spiritual experience. That truthfulness is, I think, the key here. Plenty of times I'd flippantly told God that if he'd just perform a little miracle for me, a daudle of a trick really, I'd believe. But God and I both knew I wouldn't have believed it if Jesus himself had danced into the room and began singing show tunes. I would have just had myself admitted.

So, I called 1-800-CALL-GOD and expected no answer... God picked up the phone. What. The. Actual. Fuck.

I was filled with feelings I cannot describe. I was aware of God, and of a love I could never have even imagined before. I am incapable of describing this experience. But it was real, as real as the table in front of me, and the sky over head. I made a promise to myself, and to God, and I intended to keep it. I was now a theist.

From there on out it was a matter of momentum. I believed that now that I knew there was a God that he would nudge me in the right direction. I didn't know what direction would be, but I knew I'd know it when I knew it, if you catch my drift. A couple days later the thought popped into my head (quite randomly) ""Read the gospels."" Can't ask for a clearer direction than that!

Well, the rest friends is, as they say, history. That was a couple of weeks ago. I've since been to church for the first time (I'm not so big on the tunes, but the sermon was great) and met privately with the pastor to discuss theological issues. I've started to learn to integrate my faith into my life, but it will be a long road. My wife was initially less than pleased but she is starting to settle into it and has even offered to attend Church with me this Sunday.

I am a long time lurker (: Anyway, I am getting baptized near the end of August, five days past my birthday! I am so excited. My story: I've been what I call an ""assumed Christian"" all my life. My family was Christian, I was ""taught to be Christian"", so I called myself a Christian, when in reality I wasn't. Fast forward to two January's ago. I had never been a fan of attending church. Every church I'd gone to made me feel like an outcast. But then I went to a little church in Westwego, LA. My sister, who lives in the area, convinced me to go...and I fell in love with this church. I fell in love with the way they worshiped and I fell in love with the people, but I was still missing a key part of the experience, because I had yet to fall in love with God. I loved the church, but I did not live there, and so when I came back home I fell back into my usual habits and lifestyle as if the experience hadn't affected me at all.

For the past couple of years I would attend Westwego every time I was up there, but it never impacted me the way I needed it to. The way I longed for it to. Fast forward to this past June. My sister visited us at home and looked up different churches. Sunday comes along and she convinces me to go with her to a local church in my town.

It was awesome. And I have been going every Sunday since (which isn't a lot, but enough to make an impact). A couple of Sundays ago during worship I became overwhelmed with emotion and something in my heart clicked. I think that was the moment I fell in love with God. From that day I feel like I have been snowballing. In a good way though! I've had a long talk with the pastor of my heart church (Westwego) and I've decided to get baptized. He was more than willing to do it as long as my membership would be transferred to my church in my town and I got plugged into a LifeGroup there. I'm getting baptized on August 25th and I am so excited and overjoyed.

To add to it, I am graduating with my BA in May and I am planning on attending New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary for my MDiv!

I'm not sure why you deleted your link. Maybe because you felt some of the posters were making fun of you. I'm not making fun of you, for the first 24 years of my (more or less fundamentalist) Evangelical life I thought much the same as you; but I had a paradigm shift at the age of 25 (nearly 30 years ago). I'm not belittling you or making fun of you, I understand where you are coming from, but I would like for you to consider this:

You know, if you look very closely and carefully at Matthew 24, instead of just listening to what popular preachers say, or the Left Behind fantasies, you may be surprised...

*""As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man.""* OK. So then, what was it like in the days of Noah?

*""Men were eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage right up until the day that Noah entered the ark.""* No scary times, no looming terror. Life was normal.

*""And* **they** *knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took* **them** *all away.""* Here's where you gotta pay attention. *Who* knew nothing about what would happen? Did Noah know? Certainly; God told him; he spent time building a boat. Who knew nothing? The *wicked*. So, who were ""They""? The *wicked*. So who did the flood ""take all away""? The *wicked.*. So, after the judgment was all said and done, who was left? The righteous. Noah and his family. The bad guys were taken in judgment, the righteous remained.

*""So shall it be at the coming of the Son of Man. Two men will be in the field. One will be taken and one left. Two women will be grinding at the mill. One will be taken and one left.""* Careful now - *who* is taken? Before you say the Christian is taken ""up"" - read it again - ""As it was in the Days of Noah *so shall it* be at the coming of the Son of Man."" What's the principle? Who is taken and who is left in the Genesis story? - Jesus says, ""That's the way it's gonna be at the coming of the Son of Man."" Who is taken? The wicked (not taken in rapture, taken in judgment). And who remains? Well, the righteous remain.

Ps. 37.8-11: 8 Refrain from anger, and forsake wrath!
    Fret not yourself; it tends only to evil.
9 **For the evildoers shall be cut off,
    but those who wait for the Lord shall inherit the land.**
10 **In just a little while, the wicked will be no more;**
    though you look carefully at his place, he will not be there.
11 **But the meek shall inherit the land**
    and delight themselves in abundant peace.

Matthew 5.5: **""Blessed are the meek. For they shall inherit the earth.""**

Who gets **Left Behind**?

I am in no way a social person and I just don't enjoy having to be around so many people who are trying so hard to be nice and welcoming. I find it awkward and a drain, to be honest. I listen to my Christian music all day at work and read my Bible every night. So church isn't high up there on my priority list. Nevertheless, I go every Sunday.

But my husband has always gone to church. He enjoys it for the most part, but I noticed that we alwaysget home and discuss which parts of the sermon we don't agree with. We're both pretty free thinkers and have similiar beliefs already in our heads. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a church that share our ideas. But it still provides food for thought, to listen to a pastor teaching.

We are faithful with our tithe. Always 10%, right at the beginning of the month.well, we missed the tithe for June. So last night my husband wrote out a cheque for June and July. It totalled almost $1000. As I was looking at the cheque I got this sinking feeling. I didn't feel good about it. I felt like we were paying a bill, just like we pay our phone bill, hydro bill, rent bill.... so I told him how I felt. He thought about it for a bit and agreed. 

So, why do we give the tithe to the church? I understood it was to be given to God. Does that mean only the church? We don't think so. So we are still taking out 10% of our gross income and giving it away. But not to the church. We are looking at different places. The pregnancy crisis centre, the youth drop-in centre, the homeless shelters, the food banks. And you know what? For the first time in my life, I am *excited* to give the tithe. Because I feel like it's being used for what God wants. To help the helpless, to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked. Not to buy new benches for the church that already has nice chairs, or to pay the rent of the church building that is far above what any body of believers needs. No, from now on, our tithe will be going straight to the people that need it, and that need God's love.

Please leave your thoughts here, I'd love some feedback on this. God bless!

**EDIT: Wow, I really appreciate all the encouraging comments here! It's really motivating me to make this into something even more wonderful! But one suggestion. Could we not do the whole, ""you need a new church"" thing? Believe me, we've tried and this is as good as it's going to get in our little town. When I say I'm not fond of ""church"" to begin with, I really mean it. I could live entirely by myself if need be. Small groups of like-minded friends are my thing, not large groups. Thanks for the input, but I really don't need a new church. At this point, I think I'd like to donate directly to charities, no matter how amazing a church is.

First of all sorry for my english, I'm still learning! also using a throwaway because my brother is on reddit

I guess this started around when I was 11, my friends started becoming interested in boys, but I wasnt, I just didn't find them appealing. I didnt understand it so I thought I was weird, I tried to convince myself some guy was hot, but in reality I didnt care. Instead of finding Justin Bieber and such hot, I was more interested in Emma Watson. I grew more and more attracted to girls, I thought I was a freak and just kept it bottled up until a week ago.

I really wanted to talk to someone about it, but I've never really been close to my parents, they aren't very 'loving' and I dont feel like I can open up to them. And I didn't want to freak out my friends, so I went to my priest.

Im a Catholic, go to a Catholic school and to church every week. Hes been my priest my whole life and there's nobody I trust more than him. He always helped whenever I had any trouble, I even went to him for my first bra because I felt too awkward talking about it to my parents :P

he's never said anything about homosexuality before, so I was worried because I didnt know how he would react. I managed to work up the courage to come out to him, and we talked, for ages, and it was awesome. He was so accepting and supportive. He kept stresssing how theres nothing wrong with me, how its perfectly natural and that God loves everybody, regardless of sexuality. The conversation made me feel a million times better, and much more comfortable about myself and less like a freak :)

im not sure why im posting this, I guess im just excited because its like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders and i just want to show you that most Christians don't think like the westboro baptist church :)

I will check both threads tomorrow and hopefully have made a final decision we can all accept. From there I will have a general outline.

Danny was a homeless guy that had been coming to our church for the past month or two. And Danny had a medical condition that prevented him from being able to control his bowels, so he smelled like urine and feces. And we have a small room and Danny sat in the front row, so church smelled like urine and feces when Danny was there.

But the community accepted Danny, and some folks (the pastor included) reached out to him, and started to learn his story, and started to help him. They brought him into their home so he could shower and wash his clothes and they bought him adult diapers so he could stay clean and they started the long process of tracking down his family whom he had not seen in years.

And then they found his family, and they contacted his family, and his family agreed to take Danny in. So on New Year's Eve our pastor Jacob Vanhorn drove Danny to be reunited with his family, and he woke up on New Year's Day sleeping in a bed for the first time in months and reunited with his family for the first time in years.

When Danny was on the streets, he slept in a little alcove on a bridge. It was not a very safe alcove; during the night Danny's feet hung out over a 17 foot drop onto a freeway below. But it was where Danny had to stay.

After Danny went home to his family, some people from the church went to Danny's alcove. And they found that Danny had taken a sharpie and on the outside of the alcove written ""Go to Soma Austin, place of worship, South Congress St, pastor Jacob Vanhorn"" so that other homeless men and women could find out about the church.

And on the inside of the alcove, where Danny could see it when he woke up, he had written ""Jacob Vanhorn is my friend.""

And that is one of the purest symbols of the gospel that I have ever seen. To take someone who is literally covered in his own filth and who literally cannot help himself, and welcome him in and accept him and love him and call him your friend, and then help him to be reborn as someone who is clean and loved and surrounded by family.

That story rocked me, and I felt I needed to share it. Friends, remember that God is good, and God loves you, and that you don't have to earn that or measure up to that. And remember that God wants you to love others, because that is where you will find joy and because the love of God makes everyone lovable and deserving of love.",,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,,True,t3_ob0tg,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/ob0tg/danny/,
1335710568.0,358,self.Christianity,sy6fz,"Thank you R/Christianity, you helped me believe again.",,504,146,181,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/sy6fz/thank_you_rchristianity_you_helped_me_believe/,"I'd like to thank this community (both christians and others) for helping me return to my faith. In college I slowly drifted towards a sort of agnostic christianity focused primarily on radical social justice. During law school I stopped attending church after a negative experience. Then the stress of school and the bar kept me from deeply considering my beliefs for a couple of years. A friend exposed me to the ideas of the new atheist movement, which at the time I found extremely convincing. Last year I ""came out,"" ie admitted that I was an agnostic *atheist*, to my family and friends. Around that time I joined reddit and was initially excited by the amount of non-Christian content.


 I continued to study religion, philosophy, etc. in my free time. I especially enjoyed watching debates between Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris and various theist apologists. Eventually I stumbled on to their debates with Rabbi David Wolpe. IMO Wolpe adequately defends the possibility of a theistic God and perfectly counters Hitchens' arguments against the morality of the Judeo-Christian tradition as expressed in history. However, Wolpe emphasizes that belief isn't about chalking up arguments, facts, and hypothesis, but rather the expression of a human soul's longing for God.


At the same time I became annoyed by what I considered the intellectual arrogance of anti-theists and militant atheists on Reddit. The difference in tone of r/atheism compared to r/Christianity, and the tone of Christians on the debate subreddits compared to many atheists stood out to me. It reminded me of this verse: ""By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another"" [John 13:35]. Even when atheists come here to vent or troll, the community is not antagonistic and tries to answer questions in a constructive way. Here you find members of a huge swath of the spectrum of Christian traditions discussing ideas amicably and even praying for each other. That attitude is inspiring, and something I wish occurred more often IRL.  On the other hand R/atheism with all it's constant reiteration of Christian ""hypocrisy, ""hate,"" and the ""superior ethics and morality"" of non-believers IMO is a place often focused on building itself up by tearing down others and their beliefs.

After more reading, consideration, and prayer, I decided to recommit myself to Christ at Church today. Despite the annoyance of abandoning my karma, I quit using my old account so that I wouldn't confuse anyone who might see me posting from different perspectives.

**TL;DR** Thanks, your example of a humble and loving christian community helped me to come back to my faith.

**Atheists** I'd like to head off some comments I expect I'll get. 1) Having studied the arguments for and against God, I do not believe anyone can truly ""disprove"" God's existence. Having precluded that possibility I am not concerned with ""proving"" his existence through logical formulas or scientific evidence, which I believe is also impossible. I believe because my ""heart"" tells me there is more to the universe than physics, God is real, and Christianity is true. This may be a rationalization. If so, fine, it's my rationalization. I won't ask you to believe if you don't feel the same way. To quote Jeff Goldblum, ""don't knock rationalization, it's more important than sex."" Even if I knew it with certainty it was all factually untrue, I'd rather live like it was true because I believe it's a better way of life and a more beautiful story to be a part of (which leads me to believe it is true).  2) I do not subscribe to biblical literalism. 3) I have considered the other major religions. (I worked for an interfaith organization in college and lived in Israel/Palestine for a summer.) Christianity's message resonates with me most and I feel that some faiths directly contradict my experience of God and the human condition, e.g. Islam. 4) I understand r/atheism does not reflect all atheists. I understand why you don't believe. I appreciate your arguments and ideas for helping me better define my philosophy of life.

As she wrote in the email to me, Bono doesn't really say anything particularly mind blowing or that hasn't said before, but it is remarkable and uplifting to realize that this is the sort of faith that backs some of the most popular music and successful and well known group certainly of the last 40 or 50 years. 

If anything, an interesting read:

&gt;**Bono:** My understanding of the Scriptures has been made simple by the person of Christ. Christ teaches that God is love. What does that mean? What it means for me: a study of the life of Christ. Love here describes itself as a child born in straw poverty, the most vulnerable situation of all, without honor. I don’t let my religious world get too complicated. I just kind of go: Well, I think I know what God is. God is love, and as much as I respond [sighs] in allowing myself to be transformed by that love and acting in that love, that’s my religion. Where things get complicated for me, is when I try to live this love. Now that’s not so easy.

&gt;**Assayas:** What about the God of the Old Testament? He wasn’t so “peace and love”?

&gt;**Bono:** There’s nothing hippie about my picture of Christ. The Gospels paint a picture of a very demanding, sometimes divisive love, but love it is. I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie: blood, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery. The children of God are running amok, wayward. Maybe that’s why they’re so relatable. But the way we would see it, those of us who are trying to figure out our Christian conundrum, is that the God of the Old Testament is like the journey from stern father to friend. When you’re a child, you need clear directions and some strict rules. But with Christ, we have access in a one-to-one relationship, for, as in the Old Testament, it was more one of worship and awe, a vertical relationship. The New Testament, on the other hand, we look across at a Jesus who looks familiar, horizontal. The combination is what makes the Cross.

&gt;**Assayas:** Speaking of bloody action movies, we were talking about South and Central America last time. The Jesuit priests arrived there with the gospel in one hand and a rifle in the other.

&gt;**Bono:** I know, I know. Religion can be the enemy of God. It’s often what happens when God, like Elvis, has left the building. [laughs] A list of instructions where there was once conviction; dogma where once people just did it; a congregation led by a man where once they were led by the Holy Spirit. Discipline replacing discipleship. Why are you chuckling?

&gt;**Assayas:** I was wondering if you said all of that to the Pope the day you met him.

&gt;**Bono:** Let’s not get too hard on the Holy Roman Church here. The Church has its problems, but the older I get, the more comfort I find there. The physical experience of being in a crowd of largely humble people, heads bowed, murmuring prayers, stories told in stained-glass windows

&gt;**Assayas:** So you won’t be critical.

&gt;**Bono:** No, I can be critical, especially on the topic of contraception. But when I meet someone like Sister Benedicta and see her work with AIDS orphans in Addis Ababa, or Sister Ann doing the same in Malawi, or Father Jack Fenukan and his group Concern all over Africa, when I meet priests and nuns tending to the sick and the poor and giving up much easier lives to do so, I surrender a little easier.

&gt;**Assayas:** But you met the man himself. Was it a great experience?

&gt;**Bono:** [W]e all knew why we were there. The Pontiff was about to make an important statement about the inhumanity and injustice of poor countries spending so much of their national income paying back old loans to rich countries. Serious business. He was fighting hard against his Parkinson’s. It was clearly an act of will for him to be there. I was oddly moved by his humility, and then by the incredible speech he made, even if it was in whispers. During the preamble, he seemed to be staring at me. I wondered. Was it the fact that I was wearing my blue fly-shades? So I took them off in case I was causing some offense. When I was introduced to him, he was still staring at them. He kept looking at them in my hand, so I offered them to him as a gift in return for the rosary he had just given me.

&gt;**Assayas:** Didn’t he put them on?

&gt;**Bono:** Not only did he put them on, he smiled the wickedest grin you could ever imagine. He was a comedian. His sense of humor was completely intact. Flashbulbs popped, and I thought: “Wow! The Drop the Debt campaign will have the Pope in my glasses on the front page of every newspaper.”

&gt;**Assayas:** I don’t remember seeing that photograph anywhere, though.

&gt;**Bono:** Nor did we. It seems his courtiers did not have the same sense of humor. Fair enough. I guess they could see the T-shirts.

&gt;***Later in the conversation:***

&gt;**Assayas:** I think I am beginning to understand religion because I have started acting and thinking like a father. What do you make of that?

&gt;**Bono:** Yes, I think that’s normal. It’s a mind-blowing concept that the God who created the universe might be looking for company, a real relationship with people, but the thing that keeps me on my knees is the difference between Grace and Karma.

&gt;**Assayas:** I haven’t heard you talk about that.

&gt;**Bono:** I really believe we’ve moved out of the realm of Karma into one of Grace.

&gt;**Assayas:** Well, that doesn’t make it clearer for me.

&gt;**Bono:** You see, at the center of all religions is the idea of Karma. You know, what you put out comes back to you: an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, or in physics; in physical laws every action is met by an equal or an opposite one. It’s clear to me that Karma is at the very heart of the universe. I’m absolutely sure of it. And yet, along comes this idea called Grace to upend all that “as you reap, so you will sow” stuff. Grace defies reason and logic. Love interrupts, if you like, the consequences of your actions, which in my case is very good news indeed, because I’ve done a lot of stupid stuff.

&gt;**Assayas:** I’d be interested to hear that.

&gt;**Bono:** That’s between me and God. But I’d be in big trouble if Karma was going to finally be my judge. I’d be in deep s—. It doesn’t excuse my mistakes, but I’m holding out for Grace. I’m holding out that Jesus took my sins onto the Cross, because I know who I am, and I hope I don’t have to depend on my own religiosity.

&gt;**Assayas:** The Son of God who takes away the sins of the world. I wish I could believe in that.

&gt;**Bono:** But I love the idea of the Sacrificial Lamb. I love the idea that God says: Look, you cretins, there are certain results to the way we are, to selfishness, and there’s a mortality as part of your very sinful nature, and, let’s face it, you’re not living a very good life, are you? There are consequences to actions. The point of the death of Christ is that Christ took on the sins of the world, so that what we put out did not come back to us, and that our sinful nature does not reap the obvious death. That’s the point. It should keep us humbled . It’s not our own good works that get us through the gates of heaven.

&gt;**Assayas:** That’s a great idea, no denying it. Such great hope is wonderful, even though it’s close to lunacy, in my view. Christ has his rank among the world’s great thinkers. But Son of God, isn’t that farfetched?

&gt;**Bono:** No, it’s not farfetched to me. Look, the secular response to the Christ story always goes like this: he was a great prophet, obviously a very interesting guy, had a lot to say along the lines of other great prophets, be they Elijah, Muhammad, Buddha, or Confucius. But actually Christ doesn’t allow you that. He doesn’t let you off that hook. Christ says: No. I’m not saying I’m a teacher, don’t call me teacher. I’m not saying I’m a prophet. I’m saying: “I’m the Messiah.” I’m saying: “I am God incarnate.” And people say: No, no, please, just be a prophet. A prophet, we can take. You’re a bit eccentric. We’ve had John the Baptist eating locusts and wild honey, we can handle that. But don’t mention the “M” word! Because, you know, we’re gonna have to crucify you. And he goes: No, no. I know you’re expecting me to come back with an army, and set you free from these creeps, but actually I am the Messiah.At this point, everyone starts staring at their shoes, and says: Oh, my God, he’s gonna keep saying this. So what you’re left with is: either Christ was who He said He was the Messiah or a complete nutcase. I mean, we’re talking nutcase on the level of Charles Manson. This man was like some of the people we’ve been talking about earlier. This man was strapping himself to a bomb, and had “King of the Jews” on his head, and, as they were putting him up on the Cross, was going: OK, martyrdom, here we go. Bring on the pain! I can take it. I’m not joking here. The idea that the entire course of civilization for over half of the globe could have its fate changed and turned upside-down by a nutcase, for me, that’s farfetched

&gt;***Bono later says it all comes down to how we regard Jesus:***

&gt;**Bono:** If only we could be a bit more like Him, the world would be transformed. When I look at the Cross of Christ, what I see up there is all my s— and everybody else’s. So I ask myself a question a lot of people have asked: Who is this man? And was He who He said He was, or was He just a religious nut? And there it is, and that’s the question. And no one can talk you into it or out of it.

The fact that I get to play beside my dad, with my mom conducting, is just icing on the cake.

Just wanted to share that story. Even as an atheist, I can appreciate the the sheer glory of the Easter season.

I would be annoyed if that happened to us at /r/atheism as often as it happened to you guys.

However, I would like to thank you guys. Each and every one of you on this subreddit. You all seem so level-headed and reasonable, so far from the Christians I'm used to meeting and hearing about, especially at a North Carolinian Catholic school. You remind me of the type of Christians I wanted to be when I grew up and still had faith. 

This really came up mostly because of the post that was on here earlier about stopping /r/atheism from reaching 1,000,000 subscribers to stop it from gaining popularity earlier. You all downvoted it into oblivion, and reading all of your comments about what a stupid idea it was made me crack a big smile. I'm used to meeting a lot of Christians who are so rude and offensive, and, for that matter, I meet many atheists who act the same way about their beliefs as well. But you guys know how to not take yourselves seriously when you don't need to and how to be nice and open to all beliefs.

I'm not alone in this either, their was a discussion on /r/ athiesm earlier talking about this subreddit, and there was a comment talking about how much respect the poster had for you guys that got 300+ upvotes. With that, combined with how open-minded you all are towards us, it's just nice to see people with such different beliefs getting along so well. I feel like Reddit serves as some sort of model for the religious world to follow.

In short, I'd just like to thank you all for reminding me that, despite the assholes with the loudest voices, many Christians, are kind, caring people with respect towards everyone. It does me good to read your posts.

I was reading John the Gospel. It has been something I have been building up doing for a week now and I felt ready to embrace God's word to us. 

I made it to about John 4 when the speakers overhead in the school started blaring,""Everyone, this is an emergency lockdown, please follow  the administrative staff into a place of safe hiding until further notice; this is **not** a drill.""

At first, I couldn't grasp what was happening, considering the attacks on Boston two days ago. It was unreal to me that this could be happening here, at my school, in my time of worship with God.

As people were frantically running to rooms to hide, on the phones with their loved ones, many crying, I stopped and looked at the madness. *What is going on?*, I thought.

I got hauled into a room in the back, preparing for what may come through those doors at any minute. Minutes later, we have news that an armed suspect is on campus. I am not going to lie, I start freaking out as well. My girlfriend herself is locked upstairs, but we are communicating through Facebook chat on our phones. My family members start flooding my phone with messages of comfort and worry. 

About 20 minutes in, I realize,""Why the heck am I worrying? My God can move mountains, he can part seas, surely He will protect us all."" 

Everyone is standing in the corner of the room scared, but then I simply sit down, and pull my Bible and turn to **Psalms 34:4**--

*""I sought the Lord and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears.""*

I realized this was God teaching me, *Don't be afraid of the world, I am with you always.* In those moments of doubt and fear, He took my by the hand and showed me that His word can always guide us, even in moments of doubt and fear like that.

I also turned to Hebrews 13:14, perhaps for preparation of the worst case scernario, which would really be the best case scenario:

*For we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is yet to come*

It made me realize, at any moment, no matter our say or wishes, God can take us up to join Him in His paradise.

The lockdown ended shortly after, but it truly felt almost as if God was smiling at me saying, ""Have faith, Abraham, I am here with you *always*.""

God bless, you all, /r/Christianity!!!

I hope that all of you are having a great Christmas time with your loved ones. It often seems that there's a big beef between r/Christianity and r/atheism which never stops. Both crowds are viewed by others as bickering over minutia and semantics and such, but at the end of the day, we're all Redditors here.

This time of year often gets frazzled by people arguing over the historical meaning of the season, and how valid it is or isn't to emphasize Christmas and Christ, but that's merely (in my humble view) an irritating distraction to enjoying the Christmas time.

Like a lot of non-believers, I still call it the christmas season (or sometimes the X-Mas season if I'm thinking of Futurama) because that's the holiday that I celebrated as a kid. I still celebrate it as an adult, because it's the most prevalent holiday during this time of year. I do sometimes enjoy getting into conversations about the roots of Christmas and how it became what it is now, but I only do so when a conversation has taken that direction in the first place.

My point (and I do have one) is that I want to wish you guys and gals a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. Further more, I hope the new year brings you a lot of good karma (both in up votes and IRL) and many lols.

&gt;The person making the confession is not like a servant that gives account to his lord for the management which is given over to him because the lord could not manage all or be present in all places. The all-knowing One was present at each instant for which reckoning shall be made in the account.

Nor is the person confessing like one that confides in a friend to whom sooner or later he reveals things that the friend did not previously know. The all-knowing One does not get to know something about the maker of the confession, rather the maker of confession gets to know about himself. Therefore, do not raise the objection against the confession that there is no point in confiding to the all-knowing One that which He already knows. Reply first to the question whether it is not conferring a benefit when a man gets to know something about himself which he did not know before. A hasty explanation could assert that to pray is a useless act, because a man’s prayer does not alter the unalterable. But would this be desirable in the long run? Could not fickle man easily come to regret that he had gotten God changed? The true explanation is therefore at the same time the one most to be desired. The prayer does not change God, but it changes the one who offers it. It is the same with the substance of what is spoken.

Instead, we try and modify behavior with our standards and beliefs.  That isn't the good news.  The Good News is that Jesus is available to everyone no matter where they are at.

**I've seen it stated elsewhere that /r/christianity is a mantle for politically correct Christians to display how tolerant they are.**

Ridiculous, right?  Dismiss this out of hand, right?  Well, it's getting more difficult for me not to buy into that, at least partially.

I've noticed a trend: it seems like two kinds of posts are downvoted in this subreddit, and 2 kinds only--1) trolls and 2) people whose Christian beliefs are too restrictive for the general consensus.  I'm not talking about people who post insults or flame bait.  No, I'm talking about legitimate beliefs, opinions, or concerns from more conservative Christians that find themselves relegated to the bilges of the thread.  And it's not because they're simply not being upvoted.  That's understandable and perfectly acceptable.  Rather, I'm referring to a propensity that this subreddit has to downvote, and thereby censor conservative viewpoints.

I also want to add that I realize that r/christianity has a diverse membership and is not as cohesive at it may seem. So I won't blame any one group of people.  But that being said, these censoring measures only serve to first ostracize people from this community and then entrench them in their attitudes.  The solution to disagreement here should be engagement and not suppression.

*Edit: I also thought this issue was interesting in light of the [Pew study that finds that liberals are more likely to censor viewpoints they disagree with online](http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2012/Social-networking-and-politics/Main-findings/Social-networking-sites-and-politics.aspx).

2. I was not avoiding talking to the atheists who offered advice as one person suggested.  I responded to everyone I could before signing off of reddit for the day.  I believe 1 person I responded to (Londron) is a humanist.  I cannot see flair as I'm responding from my phone.  I recognize Londron simply from being part of the community here.  If I didn't respond to you it was because of timing, not avoiding you.

3. To fill in some gaps for those wondering:

I'm 30.  I'm the family pastor but not the senior pastor.  I've been married for 6 years.  We have an elder board including the senior pastor.  We are evangelical non-denom. My assistant is a volunteer, not a paid assistant.  My wife and I, by the way, are aware of the treatments and methods of easing or working through vaginismus.  She refuses any intimacy beyond a kiss.  Period.  This is not an excuse.  I'm just explaining some of the back story that people had related questions and comments about. I am bi-vocational so I have income outside the church.

4. I sat down with my wife first.  She says she already knew that I was emotionally cheating on her but that she had hoped it would just ""go away"".  She says she wishes I had not told her but that she understands why I have.  She cried (a lot).  I cried (a lot).  She says she doesn't want a divorce, and she doesn't want the church to know.  She also says she still will not get counseling. Marriage or sexual, religious or secular.  She says I just need to repent and let it go.  We went around and around about that.  We basically concluded with the fact that I will be getting counseling whether she likes it or not but she will not be joining me.  there was so much more, including quite a bit of stammering and her understandably screaming.  There is more, but I'll just leave it at this for now...  She is gracious.

5. I met with a trusted elder and the senior pastor today.  We will meet tomorrow to discuss more in depth, but I will, at the very least, be removed temporarily from my ministerial position.

6. I am much more conservative than Reddit's user base, even /r/Christianity.  I find myself judgmentally writing off the opinions and comments of the liberals, atheists, and other-faith individuals here on a daily basis.  Yet I now find myself in the compassion and grace and tough love of so many people here that I usually write off.  The many, many personal messages and prayers are so incredibly appreciated too.   I have, at the very least, come to realize that I do not have a monopoly on truth or God.  I am a mess, swallowed up in my own depravity and eagerly pointing at what I consider depravity in others.  I repent.

1334042051.0,316,self.Christianity,s28hx,"Atheists of r/Christianity, there's one thing that's been bothering me lately about you...",paradoxia,520,204,479,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/s28hx/atheists_of_rchristianity_theres_one_thing_thats/,"I have to get this off my chest as I feel like I've been seeing it a lot more recently:

I love my atheist brothers and sisters. I am thankful for those of you that engage our community here and discuss the challenges and questions of faith with sincerity. You absolutely are part of the reason that I love participating here.

That said, there is nothing more painful and sad to me than reading threads where people are struggling with a sin issue and see it filled with atheists encouraging them in it. Admittedly, I see this from folks posting as Christians all the time too, so we are equally as guilty. But while Christians need a theological correction here, I feel like you may not understand our perspective unless I elaborate a little.

When someone says, ""hey I just had sex with my boyfriend and I'm feeling guilty about it,"" there is nothing more discouraging than clicking on the topic and seeing 50 responses by atheists saying, ""hey, that's awesome!"" or ""don't feel guilty, embrace who you are!"" I know that you're engaging honestly, and that you're trying to be encouraging, but you need to understand what your encouragement is saying from our perspective.

You're literally saying, ""Hey, you like that taste of death? Does that make you feel good? Keep doing it!"" I know that's extreme but that is the definition of sin in our faith. You are, to be blunt, encouraging someone to kill themselves spiritually (and sometimes physically too) when you say ""keep sinning, enjoy yourself!""

It's one thing to portray your viewpoint on the situation, to describe how you see the ethics of it honestly. But when someone is posting here about a sin issue, specifically seeking Christian perspective and help, or is maybe even just confused, hurt, or scared, you are, to be blunt, leading them away from Christ when you encourage them to sin more. This can happen with all kinds of sins, but lately sex seems to be the hot topic here so I use it as an example.

I don't want you to feel unwelcome. I don't want you to think you aren't allowed to share your perspective. But I would love for you to share some grace with us. We are very often lost and searching for our shepherd. When someone is suicidal, you don't hand them more razor blades. You sympathize and offer them love. Even if you don't see their actions as leading them to death, we do, and I think you can understand why that would cause us pain to read posts by you pushing them in that direction.

No doubt this will offend some of you, but I'm doing my best to speak all of this in love. And I want to be clear, I'm only referring to a certain kind of post here, not every single one that offers an atheist perspective. When you want to discuss scripture, or ask questions, or even get into some debate about interpretation, I'm always all ears. When you're telling my sister to go get laid more, you are hurting me, her, and the rest of us that believe the wages of sin are death. Please be gentle here.

I, in turn, have been helped by my girlfriend and will see a priest today (no, not for religious comfort, but for psychological support).  
  
The college has been very helpful, understanding, and responsive during this time and provided him with professional care. They've also offered me some extended deadlines and contacts for ""venting"" as [nigglereddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/13gi50/friendly_atheist_here_with_a_strange_request/c73qwsk) said.

Perhaps the most painful statement a person can hear is, “I don’t love you anymore.” Those words end relationships, break hearts, and shatter dreams. Often, people who have been betrayed guard themselves against future pain by deciding not to trust anyone’s love again. That settled conviction may even include the love of God.

The remarkable thing about God’s love for us is His promise that it will never end. The prophet Jeremiah experienced devastating circumstances that left him emotionally depleted (Lam. 3:13-20). His own people rejected his repeated calls to respond to God’s love and follow Him. At a low point, Jeremiah said, “My strength and my hope have perished from the Lord” (v.18).

Yet, in his darkest hour Jeremiah considered God’s unfailing love and wrote, “Through the Lord’s mercies we are not consumed, because His compassions fail not. They are new every morning; great is Your faithfulness. ‘The Lord is my portion,’ says my soul, ‘therefore I hope in Him!’” (Lam. 3:22-24). A person may vow to love us forever yet fail to keep that promise, but God’s love remains steadfast and sure. “He is the One who goes with you. He will not leave you nor forsake you” (Deut. 31:6). That’s a love we can trust.

O Love that wilt not let me go
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be. —Matheson

**God’s love never fails.**

Jesus Christ is easily the most dominant figure in all history.
–H.G. Wells


I know men and I tell you that Jesus Christ is no mere man. Between Him and every other person in the world there is no possible term of comparison. Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne, and I have founded empires. But on what did we rest the creation of our genius? Upon force. Jesus Christ founded His empire upon love; and at this hour millions of men would die for Him.
–Napoleon


No one else holds or has held the place in the heart of the world which Jesus holds. Other gods have been as devoutly worshipped; no other man has been so devoutly loved.
–John Knox


Even those who have renounced Christianity and attack it, in their inmost being still follow the Christian ideal, for hitherto neither their subtlety nor the ardour of their hearts has been able to create a higher ideal of man and of virtue than the ideal given by Christ of old.
–Fyodor Dostoyevsky


A man who was completely innocent, offered himself as a sacrifice for the good of others, including his enemies, and became the ransom of the world. It was a perfect act.
–Mahatma Gandhi


Jesus of Nazareth, without money and arms, conquered more millions than Alexander the Great, Caesar, Mohammed, and Napoleon; without science and learning, he shed more light on things human and divine than all philosophers and scholars combined; without the eloquence of school, he spoke such words of life as were never spoken before or since, and produced effects which lie beyond the reach of orator or poet; without writing a single line, he set more pens in motion, and furnished themes for more sermons, orations, discussions, learned volumes, works of art, and songs of praise than the whole army of great men of ancient and modern times.
–Philip Schaff


As the centuries pass, the evidence is accumulating that, measured by His effect on history, Jesus is the most influential life ever lived on this planet.
–Kenneth Scott Latourette


As a child I received instruction both in the Bible and in the Talmud. I am a Jew, but I am enthralled by the luminous figure of the Nazarene… No one can read the Gospels without feeling the actual presence of Jesus. His personality pulsates in every word. No myth is filled with such life.
–Albert Einstein


An unsurpassed master of the art of laying bare the inmost core of spiritual truth.
–Geza Vermes


Jesus Christ is to me the outstanding personality of all time, all history, both as Son of God and as Son of Man. Everything he ever said or did has value for us today and that is something you can say of no other man, dead or alive. There is no easy middle ground to stroll upon. You either accept Jesus or reject him.
–Sholem Asch


If I might comprehend Jesus Christ, I could not believe on Him. He would be no greater than myself. Such is my consciousness of sin and inability that I must have a superhuman Saviour.
–Daniel Webster


There was no identity crisis in the life of Jesus Christ. He knew who He was. He knew where He had come from, and why he was here. And he knew where He was going. And when you are that liberated, then you can serve.
–Howard Hendricks


I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father also. From now on you do know him and have seen him.

helpful. However I was wondering if /r/Christianity could stop deleting some
of the posts for whatever reasons?

     You will have to excuse my blunt and non-creative title, for creativity
 is not one of my strong suits and thus is contributing to my struggle to
 find faith. I am a scientist at heart and have always had quite the inquisitive
 mind when it comes to understanding the world in which we live in. 
I believe science and religion can co-exist and in fact are two separate disciplines,
 that is not the issue I would like advice or discussion on. 
(I would also like to shy away from debates about different religions, trinity, 
and stories from the Bible)

     I am inquiring /r/Christianity's help and advice concerning faith and God.  
I understand that there will never be a way for humans to concretely prove 
the existence of God and that's where faith comes in. I would be grateful of
 any help on these following issues or issues that you believe coincide with
 these listed:

          What is faith?
          How does one acquire faith?
          How did you obtain faith? (not necessary, however I am interested)

    I look forward to hearing from whomever feels like responding. 
Thanks again for your help and advice.

mistake this absence for a lack of interest. I will be back asap. Thanks 
again for all the input it is very much appreciated.

1364841926.0,296,self.Christianity,1bfuc9,I never really fully understood the difference between much of Western and Eastern Christian theology until I heard this...,partofaplan2,392,96,184,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1bfuc9/i_never_really_fully_understood_the_difference/,"&gt; I had this brought home to me quite profoundly the second Sunday I attended an Orthodox church. My priest, Father Gregory Horton, had invited my wife and I to dinner at his home. As our wives worked together in the kitchen preparing the meal, he and I discussed theology. At one point, he posed the question to me, “Matthew, what is grace?” I must confess that I was a little put off by that. For a second, I felt, “Does Father really think me so spiritually immature that I do not know what grace is?” So I responded very quickly, and anyone who is listening to this who has had experience with Western Christian theology knows exactly how I answered it. I proudly asserted, and we all know this, right? “Grace is God’s unmerited favor.” Father smile at me, chuckled a little and said, “Why is it that everything is a thing for you Westerners?” I had no idea what he meant, so to end my confusion, I demanded, “Well then, you tell me, what is it?” “Grace, dear Matthew,” he replied, still smiling, “is the Holy Spirit.” 

&gt; It was a revolutionizing moment in my Christian experience. As time passed, I began not just to comprehend, but also to experience what Father Gregory was telling me. The Orthodox Christian life quickly teaches us that God does not deal in things. Grace, for instance, is not some commodity that God produces. It is not something He wraps up in a spiritual package and sends to us so that we can open it up and apply it to our lives. The same must also be said for faith, or mercy, or wisdom. None of these are things. They are activities of God within the soul of a human being. Grace is God at work transforming me. Faith is the Christ who dwells within me, reaching out to the same Christ who sits on His throne in heaven. Mercy is God expressing His goodness in and through me. Wisdom is God thinking His thoughts in me. Again, this is so crucial, but it runs against the grain of this objectifying mindset that has determined, for Christians and non-Christians alike, how the Western world understand the Christian experience, and so I pray that those of you listening will really let this settle in.

&gt; Perhaps it will become clearer as we apply all this to the question of imputed righteousness. Just as with grace, or faith, or mercy, or wisdom, the Western mindset is at work here. It takes God’s activity of imputing righteousness and turns it into a thing called imputed righteousness. But just like grace, faith, mercy or wisdom, righteousness is not a thing. You cannot buy a can of it, nor is righteousness some sort of spiritual currency that God can apply to our account in heaven in order to erase the debt we owe Him for sinning against Him.

&gt; What is righteousness? It is not a thing, it is a state of being. Specifically, it is God’s state of being. It is not some thing that God produces. It is who He is. Righteousness is not even some quality or characteristic within God that He can somehow pull out chunks of and give to us to help us pay our debt to him, or use in some other way. No, righteousness is God’s perfectly humble, perfectly self-sacrificing, perfectly good, perfectly loving way of existing.

My Christian stereotype was shattered into a thousand pieces. While I still don't agree with all of it, the organizers of the event were amazingly well-versed, sensitive, reasonable, and by no means ""Bible beaters"". 

This post is to serve as a formal apology to the Christian community for assuming the lot of you have the same narrow-minded, abrasive, logic-shunning ideals that so much of your community (unjustly) bears the stigma for.

By saying this, I am not referring to simply immoral decisions, but also the intolerance and hate preached by the likes of Westboro Baptist Church.  For the Christ-followers out there who feel swallowed and discouraged by this mob-mentality of hate for the Christian faith, I encourage you to read the gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  Examine the character of Christ and ask yourself if He is truly someone you would not **want** to identify yourself with.  In light of this examination, I think you will find that the character of Jesus is impeccable.  However, the hate and misunderstanding will continue to pour out from all others who's eyes are closed.  In times such as these, I find Mark 13:13 to be very encouraging.  Such a short, simple verse.  But in light of what I have just written, I feel it is an exceptionally applicable verse.  Especially on Reddit, where it is easy to feel like a minority in your faith in Christ.

[Rant]",BranchDavidian,391,89,1107,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1hxpnu/i_went_to_the_prolife_rally_at_the_texas_state/,"Right out of the gate, I want to say that I'm not a super hip, ""progressive"" type Christian, who's either pro-choice, or indifferent to abortion as a way of showing how open-minded I am, and that's not what I'm going to try and cleverly present here.  I'm simply a believer in the sanctity of human life.  *But* I still had some issues with the rally, and where my side seems to be misguidedly trying to garner support from.

This Sunday after church I was discussing everything happening with another believer who was pro-choice, and he explained that he believed in the separation of Church and State.  I explained, ""so do I.""

Here's the issue.  Abortion is wrong regardless of what the Church says, and it's the kind of wrong that *does* hurt others.  It's not just Christians who are pro-life, it's people who understand that we need to place a supreme value on human life in all forms-- no matter how weak, or marginalized, or hidden, or voiceless.  

So, to my issue with the rally.  It felt like a large, outdoor, popcorn style church service.  It seemed odd that that would bother me as a Christian, but it really did.  Nearly every speaker talked about God, some lead us in prayer, and the whole thing was even ended with a Baptist worship band playing while people left.  I feel like it was willingly placing us in a Church *vs.* State camp, which is a misdirection of where our argumentative strengths lie on this topic. 

I never thought I would hear myself saying something like this, but the speaker I appreciated most was Mike Huckabee.  More than the rest, he actually got into world history a bit, and how damaging and costly it can be when we devalue human life, or see some in society as less valuable than others.  He touched on slavery, and how we used to tell ourselves that blacks weren't human as a way of justifying it.  Those were the kinds of arguments I was wanting to hear, and it took Mike Huckabee to finally start going in that direction after a couple dozen others took the stage to mostly recite platitudes about what God wants for our country, which wouldn't be convincing to anyone who was not already in our camp.

Oh, and I know this has been long, but the last thing I want to mention, which I think can be a great reminder to us all, was an instance that happened when one of the speakers addressed the opposition.  I'll preface by explaining that since I'd shown up at the rally, there were pro-choicers yelling things, and being slightly disruptive.  Then one speaker said, ""we have something to tell all those out there in orange and red shirts"" (the colors those who are pro-choice elected to wear) and before he could say what he was going to say a voice rang out ""FASCIST!""  But then, without hesitating, he said, ""we love you all.""  And after that I didn't hear any disruptive yelling from those in orange shirts for the rest of the rally. 

EDIT: I'm sorry if the way I opened this rant offended you.  I'm not going to change it because I don't want those in the comments to look like their complaints aren't justified.  I honestly didn't expect this post to get much attention, I just thought it would get mostly downvoted and whimper out, but I felt like getting this all off my chest anyway, and I was hoping that one or two of you might share my frustration, and that we could have a cathartic moment together, but now that it's getting a fair amount of attention, I feel like I shouldn't have been flippant about the opposition.

Over the past few months I've really started looking at myself and realized that was not who I wanted to be. There is tons of great things about Christianity and Christians. I love that what draws people to it is its message of peace and love. I love all the good things people do because of it. 

So today I went to church for the first time in a long time. I looked at it not as angry teenager who condescendingly thought I had it all figured out. I saw the affection everyone had for each other. I saw the love people had as they sang praise and worship. I saw the passion the preacher had as he gave the sermon. And honestly, I missed it. 

I'm never going to be a Christian again. Of that I'm sure. But I'm never going to treat them disrespectfully as I have in the past. I'm not going to judge someone just because of their faith.

This Sunday my church was talking about how we needed to raise money to build a cafe(sound equipment and new seating) for a church in Russia. As Christians why don't we spend less time in a building and more time out in the world helping our fellow man? 

How come in the modern church so much time and money is spent on topics/resources that don't feed the poor, or clothe the naked, or reach out to fellow humans in need. Church has become a place you dress up for and visit weekly, how can we change that to make it a body of believers that strive to serve our brothers and sisters? Isn't that what Jesus intended when He sent out His disciples to create the Church?

1339854501.0,290,self.Christianity,v4zii,I almost died yesterday. I just want to share the story of how God quite directly saved my friend and me. ,Big_Bank,479,189,360,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/v4zii/i_almost_died_yesterday_i_just_want_to_share_the/,"My friend and I made a stupid decision to try and adventure down the Yakima River (in WA) in a plastic canoe. Mind you we had absolutely no experience and only  one life jacket which was not on either of us. As soon as we entered the river, the canoe overturned and we were sent down the river, struggling to stay alive. It soon became clear after multiple attempts to swim to the shore and grab on to branches that due to the swift and fast moving current that we were likely never going to make it out. I came to terms with that fact that I was going to die, thinking of my family as I used up all of my energy just to keep my head above the water. 

Here is where the miracle happened. In my complete helplessness I shouted out to God, ""Save us!"". Just at that moment a 80-90 foot tall tree (which was about 150 feet in front of us and along the edge of the river, and which was completely alive and healthy) completely uprooted and fell into the river. As I witnessed this I knew that it was the hand of God that caused the tree to fall on a perfectly windless day.

The tree however was meant for my friend, not me, as he was able to grab on to the tree and hang on to it for dear life for about 25 minutes until a rescue boat was able to reach him. I was sucked under the tree and continued down the river for about another 1/4-1/2 miles. I was completely and utterly exhausted and I realized that i would not be able to fight the river much longer but something inside told me to make one last effort to reach the edge (knowing that it would be my last attempt before I would half to give up). I happened to come to a part of the river that was less shallow and less swift and was able to grab on to a log. I couple happened to be hiking along the river directly next to me and they helped me on to shore.

I have had my share of doubts about the existence of God, but from this day forward I will never doubt that our God exists and that he hears us. Praise Jesus, God is good.

TL;DR
Friend and I were drowning in a river and when I cried out to God to save us he fell a large, perfectly healthy tree into the river right in front of us.

**EDIT:** I of course recognize the importance of the people who were there to rescue us from the water. My utmost respect and thanks go out to those amazing and brave people. The fact is though that there would not have even been a rescue had the tree not fallen over. I recognize that it is common for trees to fall into rivers due to erosion, and I have no problem saying that It eroded and fell at the exact moment that we needed it to because of God. I do have my doubts about it falling due to erosion however since It was completely upright, perpendicular to the ground and it was a sudden, fast collapse (it didn't start to lean and then eventually fall).",,False,,t5_2qh6c,1339881987.0,,chirho,True,t3_v4zii,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/v4zii/i_almost_died_yesterday_i_just_want_to_share_the/,

Bear witness to my testimony, two years ago I was addicted beyond belief to meth. I'm sober now, 1 year sober in fact, amen. But 2 years ago, I was not, I was polluting the temple that the lord so graciously has given me with drugs and sin. 

I was homeless, ran away from my parents who I felt were too dominating in my life. They thought I was going down a sinful path and were going to send me to a school for troubled teens somewhere in Texas, a Southern Baptist school of some sort if I recall correctly.

I ran away, found myself all the way over in Los Angeles and soon was out of money. One thing led to another and before long I was prostituting myself to survive. I sold my body, my dignity, and my will to live. To fill the emptiness inside of me I turned to drugs and began to smoke meth.

About a year and a half ago I met a young gentleman who I shall not name. He paid upfront for my time and we went to a motel. He tied me up and took a knife to me and cut me badly. He didn't say this but when I started to pray he became enraged and beat me even more saying that I was a stupid whore for believing in something that didn't exist. It was then I shut my eyes and got ready to die. 

I was lucky, Jesus stood with me, because rather than killing me he left the room, left the door open, and just walked out. A maid found me and I spent nearly 2 weeks in the hospital. In the hospital the chaplain prayed with me and with his help I was connected to a small organization in Los Angeles that helped me transition from the street and my life as a prostitute to a healthy life in a real home with a real family.

God bless you all!

I hope one day he will believe as I do with all his heart that through Jesus anything can be possible.

**Edit: A copy-paste of my reply to everyone's support here:**

Dear /r/Christianity,

I am completely overwhelmed by all of the encouragement and support that you have given me. I submitted this post out of desperation on my mobile phone late last night when I felt like I was at the lowest of the low. Today I spent the whole day resting and reflecting. The comments here are nothing but a blessing to me...I have read every single one. Thank you so much, and more importantly thank GOD. I have a long road ahead of me, and even though it will be difficult...praise God!!

As for whether or not I'm part of a Christian community, the irony here is so strong.. I am the son of a Christian pastor, a member of the church's worship team as a singer, and one of the devotion leaders of the church's youth ministry. My brothers and sisters in Christ have constantly reached out to me on a regular basis, but I would lie and deceive them to make it appear that my walk with God was going strong. I've been living a double life, going to church on Sundays and catering to church 'commitments' while living an excessively sinful life on the other side as a college student. No one in my Christian community ever knew, not even my parents.

I have no choice but to say everything as it is.
The shame I carry is immense..


But to God be the glory...I will read His Word more, pray to God more, and praise Him more. What I want is an intimacy with Him that is greater than I've ever had before, because I feel that achieving this will pave the way for everything else in my life. I want my life to glorify God.

There's so much work for me to do.

'Are you ready to find Jesus?'

'Yes I am'replies the drunk, so the preacher grabs him and dunks him in the river. He pulls him up and asks the drunk, 'Brother, have you found Jesus?'

The drunk replies, 'No, I haven't.'The preacher, shocked at the answer, dunks him into the water again, but for a bit longer this time. He pulls him out of the water and asks again, 'Have you found Jesus, my brother?'

The drunk again answers, 'No, I have not found Jesus.' By this time the preacher is at his wits end so he dunks the drunk in the water again, but this time he holds him down for about 30 seconds.

When the drunk begins kicking his arms and legs, the preacher pulls him up. The preacher asks the drunk again, 'For the love of God, have you found Jesus?'

I reported it, as I noticed at least one other poster did: http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/n8obs/the_reddit_cycle_of_atheist_bigotry_though_im_a/c3766mx

It's causing too much /r/atheism backlash, and I think belligerent links like this just make it worse for our minority here. How about we not draw attention to ourselves in this issue? It will only cause the problem to get worse, as we will experience much more trolling (as evidenced in this thread). Since it is so highly upvoted, I think that a short response discussing why it was removed would be good. Something along the lines of ""We don't try to cause strife, and posts generalizing a group negatively will be removed.""

*But, that's just like, your opinion, man.* I know, but please, hear me out on this one. This will be the first step in the wrong direction for our subreddit if we turn into atheist/[r/atheism]-bashers, just like the post implies of /r/atheism's attitude towards our minority. I will not participate in a community that seeks joy and upvotes of creating strife between subreddits or by bashing atheists or other religious groups. I agree with the sentiments in the post, but in this case they are overly-generalizing, and it has no place here.

This guy is obviously a sock puppet troll trying to cause strife. Maybe he's worth banning... Account is only 3 days old, and all he wants to do is remove /r/atheism from the default subreddit list. http://www.reddit.com/user/i_want_to_be_an_ant

Also, notice how the thread is getting vote-modded favoring atheists who already cross-posted the thread, as many people with Christian flair are getting downvoted from being seen. Also, there aren't many people with Christian flair commenting at all. If there was more support for this, you would see more comments of Christians.

tl;dr Let's make this place about Christianity, not /r/atheism.

A lot of the kooky churches in the south that you see with pastors making the news (N.C. pastor recently with the comments about kids and gender roles) are Independent Fundamental Baptist churches and are not affiliated with the Southern Baptist convention. Many Independent Fundamental Baptist churches were formed because they saw the Southern Baptist convention becoming too liberal for them.

For 1-2 years I lived in fear everyday that I wasn't saved because I didn't feel like it. I went to church camps and didn't get that warm fuzzy feeling that the Spirit brings that everyone talked about. Literally 2-3 days ago I realized: God isn't about emotions. He's about faith, trust, and actions based off of faith. I had to quit saying ""Oh i don't feel saved or oh I feel like i'm being fake when I worship"" and understand that God said I was saved if I accepted Jesus. I don't know if anyone else has gone through this, but tip: don't follow your emotions when it comes to God, follow what His Word says.

I didn't mean to totally eradicate emotion. I know I came off that way though haha. But as one guy said, Facts (Scripture), Faith, and emotions. If how we feel doesnt line up with scripture, something is wrong. I.e. I don't feel saved but I believe that Jesus died for me and I accept Him as Lord and Savior.

A lot of you know me from /r/christianity. I serve as bishop for Church of the Resurrection in Sherman, TX. We're about 2 hours south of where the tornado hit in Moore, OK.

While a lot of money, food and supplies will be coming into Moore from a lot of different places, one very sad problem may be easily overlooked. No one sets aside money for the funeral expenses of a child. At least 9 children were killed by the tornado and the unimaginable devastation for the families is only added to by the unexpected costs. 

We have a group of 30 congregations in our area that are joining together Sunday to receive a special offering to assist with funeral costs in Moore. We have contacted the funeral homes there and the consensus is that a basic burial will cost about $3300.

I am inviting r/christianity folk to join with us if you are looking for a way to help. You can make your checks payable to:

Church of the Resurrection

P.O. Box 1281

Yet, I saw several of those self-described conservatives or fundamentalists express surprise yesterday that the response to the question ""do you believe in a physical, bodily resurrection"" [was a resounding ""YUP.""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/12vmkm/do_you_believe_the_resurrection_actually_happened/)

I think this idea that /r/Christianity is primarily a gathering place for people with bad theology can be easily dispelled.

Believe me, I understand your contention. I come from a very conservative, non-denominational, right-wing, inerrantist, creationist, fundamentalist background. As much flak as that group gets, the people who shared those beliefs with me were loving and generous and kind. They wouldn't turn a gay person away from their church, they led food drives for the poor and missions trips. On the whole, they tipped very well. One thing I can say, however, is that I was once very suspect of the theology of other Christian denominations. I would often deride other churches by saying ""they don't preach the Bible."" Or ""they have gay preachers."" Or ""they don't teach salvation."" the list goes on.

While I remain a traditionalist - my theology does not include much that the early church wouldn't have affirmed - over the past half-decade or so, my views have changed.  One of the most important things that I learned was the wisdom of that maxim often attributed to St. Augustine:

**In essentials, unity. In non-essentials, liberty. In all things, charity.**

To our conservative readers who feel marginalized, I just want to express that this is *not* a place where good theology is trumped by post-modernism, liberalism, humanism, or what have you. It's a place where various expressions of the faith come to discuss their views on what it means to be a Christian.  I realize that we have varying views on gender roles, homosexuality, politics, inerrancy... But the fact is [as Battered_Saint beautifully pointed out today](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/12wwki/the_problem_with_christianity/), those things are *far less important* than the actual fundamentals of the faith.

The majority here believe in a personal, all-powerful, all-loving God.

The majority here affirm the virgin birth.

The majority here believe in a bodily resurrection.

The majority here anticipate the return of Christ.

In short, the majority of people who consider themselves Christian on /r/Christianity affirm the exact same things that more conservative Christians believe when it comes to matters of salvation.  [The Apostles' Creed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostles'_Creed) neatly sums up those core beliefs that are shared by Catholics, Protestants, Orthodox, Baptists, Emergents, Presbyterians, Evangelicals, Methodists... nearly any denomination you can name.

So, conservatives of /r/Christianity, this is the place for you too. If issues like homosexuality or abortion or women in the pulpit or evolution are important to you - by all means, share! And when you do, share with the knowledge that those who have different beliefs often have the same core values that you do when it comes down to brass tacks. We're all on the same team.

Well, I'll do my best.  Here's the thing.  You can't convince someone that the Bible is true, in whole or in part, by referring only to the Bible when their default position is to not believe the Bible at all.  Any Bible reference you make will be automatically rejected because it's part of the book they have already chosen to reject in its entirety.  

To put it yet another way, you cannot scripturally prove anything to someone who doesn't believe in scripture to begin with.

I am convinced that the only way to evangelize to a true atheist is to simply live as Christlike as possible.  Be the one whose faith lets you be calm in a crisis.  Be the rock against the storm.  Be the one who is genuinely kind and treats others as Christ would.  Be a living testament and maybe someday they will become interested in the New Testament.

I'm posting this here because I've had numerous discussions with many people here on this sub, although it was a long time ago, some of you may remember me. 

You may be curious why I've decided to leave, basically I guess it boils down to three issues. 

1) In all of the thousands upon thousands of ancient Christian manuscripts that we have, not one of them uses the name Jehovah, the first translations of the Christian scriptures to ever use the name Jehovah (or something similar) were written around the 15th century. I can only see two conclusions from this, either they have all been altered, which leaves me with a very uncomfortable feeling because then how can I trust that the entire body of Christian scripture has not also been drastically altered, or the alternative, that the name Jehovah was important for Jews, but wasn't meant to be all that important for Christians, and the name of Jesus was meant to replace it in importance. 

2) Blood, there is a scripture (1 Samuel 14:33) where King Saul's men slaughter and eat animals with the blood, the Law was very clear that they should be put to death, yet they were not, apparently they were excused because they were extremely tired and hungry. Given that situation, I don't see how a person could be asked not to take a blood transfusion when their life is in danger. 

3) The Governing Body of Jehovah's Witnesses tries to rewrite their own history on a regular basis. They regularly hold the mistakes of other religions up to the light and accuse them, but when it comes to their own mistakes they do their best to hide them, and then erase them from their history. I'm convinced that If God raised up a prophet like Jeremiah and sent him to the Watchtower today, they would label him an apostate and disfellowship him, even if he could do miracles, they would attribute the power to demons and not God. 

4) (bonus!) The Watchtower is basically interested in two things, gaining converts, and acquiring land to build more places of worship, their accumulated wealth is worth hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps billions. Jesus had no place to rest his head, and said that whenever two were gathered there he would be, so no fancy meeting place was required, and he also placed a strong mandate upon his followers to care for the poor and to feed the hungry and less fortunate. 

I've moved on with my life now. I haven't been disfellowshipped, but I've told the elders that I no longer have faith in this religion and have no intention of ever returning.

Not...uh...when we go up against the very places we do all these counter protests their definition of love appears to be gushy, mushy, meaningless crap or all those fag parades...their definition of love is lust. Physical lust.

D.M.: Uh-huh

F.P.: The Bible's definition clearly says so is...telling your neighbor the truth. Warning them that their sin is taking them to hell. And that's proof. And that's love.

D.M.: Ok, second question is do you believe there are different levels of sin?

F.P.: ...Yes

D.M.: Could you elaborate please

F.P.: Well, obviously stealing a candy bar is different from homosexual sex and--

D.M.: --but do you believe there is a different punishment for these different levels?

F.P.: Absolutely, I think the Bible clearly talks about different degrees of punishment and there's never been...the only example of sin in the Bible that has destroyed a nation is sodomy....Sodom and Gomorrah...Are you still there?

D.M.: Yes, I am.

F.P.: Sodom and Gomorrah was physically destroyed. If you believe what the Bible says, fire and brimstone completely wiped it off the planet. And their sin was surrounding Lot's house, sodomites surrounding their house wishing, commanding that they have homosexual sex with the angels that were in his house and that's grievous... that’s a sin the Bible calls abomination.

D.M.: OK. If you could define salvation, how would you define it?

F.P.: Rescuing..uh..a sinner from his eternal damnation...

D.M.: ...OK. How important was Jesus's ministry on earth in your opinion?

F.P.: Well, I think without that, without the ultimate sacrifice...crucifixion...there would not be any hope for the human race so obviously its important.

D.M.: Yes, sir. OK, what is the most important thing for a christian to accomplish?

F.P.: Well, what Christ said, his last words to his disciples was to go on and preach...

D.M.: Uh-huh.

F.P.: And feed my children, feed my lands, feed my sheep.

D.M.: Uh-huh.

F.P.: And that's not talking about physically feeding...I mean it could include that, but it means providing them with physical food and sustenance so those two things would be near the top, if not at the top of the list. Preaching to the world and providing for their children.

D.M.: OK. If..I'm not sure if you’re familiar with the verse, but what does John 3:17 mean to you?

F.P.: Well, I don't have my bible right in front of me...

D.M.: OK

F.P.: But, obviously its right after John 3:16, which is one of the most misused verses of the bible on the planet--

D.M.: --Well, i have the verse in front of me if you'd like me to read it to you. I did type it out--

F.P.: --Sure.

D.M.: It is “For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved.”

F.P.: ...Yeah, and then the next verse...read the next verse.

D.M.: Well, I don’t have the verse available to me right here--

F.P.: OK, well the gist is here, it also talks about 16 itself or 18...if you don’t believe on him, you're not going to be saved. I don't remember the exact lines...whoever believes on him will be saved. “The world” is used in many different ways throughout the Bible. It refers to the earthly geographical, sometimes it refers to the gentiles as opposed to the Jewish world, it..at no time does it include every single human being really...if...they included that at time in the front cause even then it didn’t include every human being. It's misused. It's clearly not every human being that...God did not come to love every human being or every human being would be in heaven. His love is impotent...his salvation is impotent if he has to rely on some week sinful humans to accept it.

D.M.: OK. Yes, as I'm saying...I'm writing this research paper on the Westboro Baptist Church's interpretation of the Bible and, in my searching, I came across the Five points of Calvinism and that seems a lot like one of the five points.

F.P.: Uhh...whats one of the five points?

D.M.: Well, you're mentioning the world and how it talks about the man of spirit within the world of flesh and--

F.P.: --Yeah, the closest it would come with the five points is limited atonement. The atonement is limited. It's not for every single human being. Did Hitler go to heaven?

D.M.: I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.: Did Osama Bin Laden go to heaven?

D.M.: I'm sure he didn’t.

F.P.: Did Christ die for him? Did he send his son that Osama Bin Laden might be saved?

D.M.: I don’t know, sir.

F.P.: Did Adolph Hitler or the tyrants and murders...Stalin? We have dealt with this in great detail on our website. There is a special paper called the “John 3:16 Lie”. We’ve gone into great academic detail cause that verse is so fragrantly and sadistically misused. If the students in our colleges, such as yourself, treated other scholarly works the way they treat superficially John 3:16, they would flunk out of school so I would refer you to that paper that’s there on the website, the “John 3:16 Lie”, i think that’s what its called.

D.M.: OK. Is there any place for repentance for homosexuals?

F.P.: You know...uh...we've certainly been asked that many times over the years. there’s two passages in the bible that pretty well convince me the answer is “no”, although I would never say 100 percent cause there’s another verse that suggest that some of the numbers of...I forget what church it was...might have been church Galatia where Paul writes...says some...if days go by some of its views on mankind a reference to homosexuality and all like it.. and now they read it at the church but i think the answers probably “no” and I say that because, in Romans Chapter 1, where three different times describing homosexuals...god has given them up. You can't come to repent that so God has given you up and then the other passage would be, I believe revelations chapter 22:15, where there’s a list...5 or 6 types of humans who will never go to heaven...and the first on that list is dogs, and dogs is the Bible's metaphor for homosexuals.

D.M.: We're very close to being finished here. So this is kind of branching off of that question. Is it the church's opinion that it is entirely a choice to be homosexual? [crosstalk] Now I'm not asking about performing homosexual acts...I'm asking about, within your heart and mind, does your church believe it is a choice to be a homosexual?

D.M.: Well, it's our belief that that is a condition that god has placed that person in. just like Pharaoh's heart. You know, the old story of Pharaoh and Moses. It's a condition that he places them in. It's part of his judgment of that human because they rejected...again, Roman Chapter 1 describes this in great detail. They rejected, refused to acknowledge him as God.

D.M.: Uh-huh.

F.P.: You know, you kind of remind me of my son a little bit; he says ""uh-huh"" a lot like you do.

D.M.: [chuckle] Oh, well--

F.P.: --How old are you?

D.M.: I am 26, sir.

F.P.: Well, he's 37 so he's a little older but he does have that as well. So you're only 26? Where are you going to school?

D.M.: I'm going to school at..uh..its a community college in New Bern, North Carolina.

F.P.: OK, well i hope you have a good experience there, I hope your efforts are successful.

D.M.: Well, yes. I hope so too, sir. I just do have two last questions for you. It seems like your church elevates homosexuality above tax cheaters, adulterers, and murderers. I'm not sure if you would interpret this as true, but could you comment on that?

F.P.: ...Whats that again? Tax cheaters?

D.M.: Well, tax cheaters, adulterers, murderers...

F.P.: ...Well, I would say to you, I would say two things, there. First thing is we do indeed preach to...uh...we have signs that say “Divorce = Adultery” and we have signs about abortion, which certainly is the main fashion of killing in this nation anymore. Tens of thousands of babies killed every year so we do indeed press those issues but that leads me to my second point I would make on this is...we don’t control the media. The media has been pushing this fag filth for several decades. They are the ones who have pushed this onto the front pages of the nation's newspapers and the lead stories on the 6 o’clock news and the national news...this homosexual relentless **** beatings that’s bound resulting in same sex marriage across the nation so that’s the part of our ministry that seems to get most of the media attention as that’s part of their agenda. So that would be my second major point.

D.M.: OK, well i have just one final question for you, sir. I'm aware from my research that the Westboro Baptist Church is comprised mostly of family members, immediate and distant...uh...children and adults alike, this is correct, right?

F.P.: Well, i don't know what the percentage is, but there are a lot of people in our church that are related, marriage or otherwise.

D.M.: Alright, well, suppose that one of the children ,who are under the age of 18,...essentially...came out and announced they were homosexual. What would be the church's opinion on...the decidings[sic] of the individual?

F.P.: Well, we don’t...first of all, that has not happened and we would not expect that to happen in the true church of the lord Jesus Christ...if you're talking about if they were a member--

D.M.: Well, essentially, Mr. Phelps, I'm trying to find--[crosstalk]

F.P.: If they were not a member, if they're just...you know..i mean...a child of one of the church members...there wouldn’t be any different reaction. we've had people leave this church for all kinds of reasons, they obviously would not be comfortable here...

D.M.: What I'm really trying to find out with this question is...you know..obviously this child would not be able to legally leave...or become emancipated. I'm trying to find if the church would..i mean..place the child up for adoption? Or if the church would--

F.P.: --[chuckle] No, our job is to preach and that’s what we would continue to do to him or her or anyone else who is in the hearing of our voices.

D.M.: Well, its just...I'm sorry I'm not putting it quite as eloquently as it is in my head. All these members..the several that have left the church, they’ve all done on there own volition, but I'm trying to find out if someone in the church wasn’t “up” with someone else in the church, in this case a child, would this child have to leave?

F.P.: No, our responsibility is to raise our children and that’s what we do.

D.M.: Well, I think that’s all of my questions, Mr. Phelps. At the end of this, I'd like to say if you're not too busy, if you have anything you'd like to add...I mean, the floor is entirely open to you. As I said, I will be transcribing this and I will be presenting this to the classroom so...eyes will be seeing this so if there's anything you'd like to add please feel free to say anything you like.

F.P.: Well, of course I don't know what your topic is on per se'.

D.M.: Well, we were instructed to write on the Bibles influence on western culture and I specified by choosing the Westboro Baptist Church and I'm writing essentially about the five points of Calvinism.

F.P.: Right, OK, well I think its fairly well known who we are and what we're about. It's not rocket science. The Bible...we believe the error free word of God...that’s life and hope for the human race and that’s what we preach and have believed and preached since 1955, that’s “one-nine-five-five”, and...you know I've appreciated the opportunity to respond to your questions and I hope it helps you and anyone else who hears it

D.M.: Yes sir, you certainly did and I'm very glad I got this opportunity as well.

F.P.: OK, well you have a nice day out there and we'll talk to you later or not... but thanks for calling.

D.M.: Thank you very much, Mr. Phelps.

F.P.: OK, bye.

D.M.: Bye.

Often times when I browse reddit, I'm not logged in. This results in me seeing a lot of /r/atheism posts which invariably make their way to the front page. I've read the comment threads in many of them and there are always two types of posts from Christians. The first, of course, is from people who feel the need to apologize for their faith. The second is from people complaining that atheists are picking on them. Occasionally, someone will come in and attempt to save the day with a wonderful apologetic discourse.

Stop, you're doing it wrong. These are not our battles to fight and will not win souls.

First and foremost, love other people. Love them regardless of their religion, regardless of their social status, and regardless of their past. When someone needs help, help them. If you see someone who is hungry, feed them. If you see someone who is hurting, hug them. Show people love with no ulterior motive other than your desire to love on them. Some of these people will ask you why. Why are you helping someone like me? When you answer that you do this because God loves me, even though I don't deserve it, they will respond in a way that lets you know their hearts are ready for the Gospel or they won't. Either way, continue to serve and show them love.

Secondly, I'll say that each of us should remember that our primary testimony is the life that we live. You need to realize that you cannot be in the World and also in the Kingdom sol stop holding onto the world, stop seeking its acceptance and just live your life in a Christlike manner. People will notice this, and people will ask you why and the response is exactly the same as above.

Winning souls is not about being knowing the Bible from beginning to end, its not about being able to defend the faith, and it is not very difficult. It comes down to one simple fact - you received a gift from God that you have no right to and you have been set free and its your responsibility to share that with the World.

I'm a pretty regular contributor here.  I am at a broken, painful place right now.  I need help, prayer, advice, condemnation, something.  I can't process my thoughts right now.

My wife and I have had problems with our sex life since we were married.  She suffers from vaginismus but is too ashamed and embarrassed and scared to seek help.  She flatly refuses.  We have sex about 3 times per year.  We've somehow had 2 children within our 3 years of marriage.  I was very sexually active in my past (before my wife).  I am the only person she has had sex with, but she was sexually molested a few times by her step-father as a young girl.  We did have sex a couple times before marriage, although we both view this as sinful.  We are both very conservative Christians.  I am an ordained and licensed minister.

What began as simple communication about church events with my assistant (my wife's best friend) somehow turned sexual.  I cut it off a few times, but she has been very persistent.  And tonight...  I have read through the texts, and I'm still not sure how things progressed as they did.  I cheated on my wife in our SUV with her best friend of many years.

I am so stupid.  I felt like I deserved it, like my wife was to blame because she refuses to have sex or seek treatment.  I was wrong.  I was so wrong.  My wife is a very fragile woman, and she has no strong family ties.  She has few friends because she is so shy.  And I just slept with her best friend.

I am so terrified of what confessing this might cause.  Of course I'm terrified of being exposed as well.  Our church and our little community would likely collapse under the weight of what I've done.  I am a fool.  I am so broken.  I want to die.

God, help me.

That said, would you be interested in an AMA?  [I brought this up in the last N. T. Wright post and it was fairly well-received.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/13tjv0/nt_wright_challenging_modern_worship_songwriters/c774w2x)  It was noted that he would be too busy to participate, and I agree, but I figured it wouldn't hurt to contact him to see if he's interested and give him enough heads up about it.

Well wouldn't you know it, he responded!  And really quickly, too, which is to his credit.  He did say that he was extremely busy right now with speaking engagements, visiting family for the holidays, and wrapping up his ""big book on Paul"" (seriously, it's a 3 volumes.)  He said that this is something that he would like to do (!), but that he couldn't commit to anything yet and to check back with him in February.

I'm planning on doing so, but I'd like to gauge your interest to see if this is something that would be well-received by the community.  I get the feeling that the answer is ""yes"" but I want to make sure before asking him again in a few months.  I've already talked to the mods and they agreed on hosting it.  

Let me know what you think!

**EDIT:**

Ok, sounds like a ""yes.""  I'll let you know what response I get back in February.

1301145263.0,270,self.Christianity,gbx7p,"Why I, a biologist, hate creationists",JimmyGroove,332,62,162,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/gbx7p/why_i_a_biologist_hate_creationists/,"Simple answer: They are all libelous bastards accusing all scientists of being a part of multi-million person international conspiracy to send people to hell.

More complex answer:  When one person says that another person is advocating a wrong position about an issue, the underlying logic falls into one of three categories:

1. The other person is wrong because they have less information than the first person.  - This is the least judgemental category, as we are all a bit ignorant about one thing or another.  However, it cannot be the reason why creationists insist that evolutionary biologists are wrong, because we have far more information than them.  I have never met a creationist who was able to keep up with me once I start talking about molecular biological evidences for evolution; they generally get very upset and complain about me using big words.

2. Though they have the same or more information to base their conclusion on, their thought processes are wrong. - This one boils down to ""You are stupid."" ""You are delusional."" and the like.  However, this one also doesn't work as the reason creationists say that biologists are wrong.  Why?  Because if garbage logic is being applied to a set of information, that logic will not produce a coherent position which fits all of the data and meshes perfectly with the work of millions of other scientists.  So that leaves us with 3.

3. The other person is lying. - Finally, the person could be advocating the wrong position not because they believe it to be true, but because of another reason.  This is the only one that fits as a creationist logic behind why science as a whole says something they insist isn't true, since only through conspiracy could science present such a unified front.

Now, what else does that entail?

1. That would mean that everyone in a field related to the age of the earth or the history of life on it (physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and countless other areas) is all a part of this conspiracy.

2. Since many of the people involved in this conspiracy aren't doing financially that well (you make far, far more money as a creationist than as a real scientist), the point of the conspiracy can't be money.

3. Since the creationists insist that the truth is supported by the facts, then scientists must be aware of the truth (i.e. that their version of Christianity is real), and thus have to be aware that by promoting science, they are leading people away from True Christianity.

4. As a result, the only logical conclusion (given these ridiculous assumptions presented by creationism) is that everyone in the field of science is a willing and gleeful agent of Satan.


Some people may say that I am misinterpreting creationism, but that is BS; watch one of their propaganda flicks like Expelled and you'll see them accuse everyone in science of being responsible for evils up to and including the Holocaust (funny, considering the Nazis banned the teaching of evolutionary biology because it was against the Bible).  It is very clear that while creationists will usually stop short of blatantly saying that science is pure evil, they are more than happy to all but say it and let everyone who listens to them draw that conclusion.

I pulled up my browser and turned to our donations page.

I was shocked to see that our $5,000 goal was met and exceeded.  In *less than a day*.

Before offering you the congrats that you deserve, I want to put things in perspective.  Our money is paper in our pockets, numbers on a screen, a bit of plastic with a magnetic strip.  Our money has no eternal worth. We're storing up treasure elsewhere.  But God takes these feeble offerings, and He transforms them.  He grows them into a cow, and then eleven cows.  Each of these cows makes milk, which nourishes the poor, which allows them to feed the hungry, which encourages brotherly love, which blossoms into hope, and **[hope isn't lost on a single soul](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A5&amp;version=ESV),** because it's rooted in the Holy Spirit.  Your offering has eternal benefit.  Praise Him.

Some of you offered $5, others $1,000.  Some of you could only lift up this effort in prayer.  But every single one of you who gave a bit of encouragement, a dollar of your money, a prayer of expectation, can be said to have heeded the words of Christ when He said ""I was hungry.  And **you** fed me.""  Christian or atheist, you are responsible for lifting a spoon to the mouth of an emaciated Savior.  I just want to thank each of you from the bottom of my heart for your sacrificial giving.

We've also realized another benefit, however minor compared to the lives that will be changed by your gift.  The frontpage quality of /r/Christianity is absolutely stellar.  We're allowing ourselves to refocus even our messing-around online habits to what truly matters.  Let's keep it up!  When you see a Dead Horse Post, direct it toward our charity drive - allow even the most endlessly beat-to-death topics to turn into an opportunity to give.

The band Halloween, Alaska echoed the verse from Romans above with the lyric ""hope won't weigh you down.""  I'm sure you'll join with me in daring to hope for more, which brings me to a question for you, /r/Christianity.  **Where do we go from here?  How do we maintain this level of support?

There are obviously some moral decisions like abortion that I believe very strongly in and I believe the government has the responsibility to step in and do justice where injustice is happening. This is not, however, what I am talking about. I’m talking about government not having an established religion that it supports. The framers of our Constitution were not thinking about Christianity when they planned this country. It is also worth noting that most of the framers of our Constitution were Deists, not Theists, so that might not be the best way to go.

All of that to say, It is important that Christians support the separation of Church and State. It may seem backwards for a Evangelical pastor so think this way, but let me explain why I hold this view and why I believe you should two.

**1. – Separation of Church and State keeps the government out of our churches.**
President Obama and Governor Kasich have no sway in the way that we worship, how we run our churches, who is allowed to be a part of our communities, etc. This is freedom often taken for granted in America. Be thankful.

 

**2. – Separation of Church and State keeps our schools concentrated on the right things.**
Now, i know a lot of people get bent out of shape because there is no more prayer in school and there isn’t a Bible class, but that is not the goal of school and it’s not the responsibility of teachers. The God-given, Bible-ordained model for spiritual growth and discipleship is the family unit. Our kids are in school to learn academics. Teach them about God in your home and as you do life. Better yet, train them on how to be a missionary cleverly disguised as a student in public school so that they can be a part of life transformation!

 

**3. – Separation of Church and State keeps ALL religion out of schools and government.**
Remember, if prayer becomes allowed in school and religious instruction becomes the norm, this opens the door for all religions to capitalize on this freedom. Nonestablishment is vital in keeping militant Islam and the progression of sharia law out of our schools and government as a whole. This is a giant can of worms that needs to stay closed.

**4. It’s not the governments job.**
The jobs of spiritual growth and evangelism are not in the realm of the governments responsibility. Jesus never uses government to push his agenda. The Christian life is a life of personal impact, love for difficult people, laying down one’s life, healing broken people. The church cannot use unchristian government as an excuse to not follow in the footsteps of Jesus. It is not the presidents job, or the job of congress, or any other person in political power to advance the gospel – it’s yours and it’s mine and if we fail in that and then blame it on the government, shame on us!""

Because I can say that I'm a progressive-minded person, yet be repelled by any conservative sources of information.

Here's an example: 

My wife is more conservative than I am, but she's generally more open-minded too. We've been having a heck of a time with our 3 yr old, so she's been looking for resources on strong-willed kids. She found a radio show from Focus on the Family about raising a strong-willed child. She sent me the link and told me I should listen to it. My first though was ""No way, I'm not giving these guys the time of day."" But I then decided that's silly and childish, so I listened to the program and that episode was pretty good.

So, I guess this is just my confession of needing to be more humble in my conversation and attitude to those who are more conservative, evangelical and fundamentalist. Peace guys.

Many of these have been answered in countless prior discussions, or are addressed in the FAQ.  Unfortunately, our frontpage can be dominated by these posts – sometimes for days in a row – making it tough for the community to engage on a more timely and interesting level.

A couple days ago [EarBucket proposed a weeklong moratorium](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tb89b/a_proposal_dead_horse_week/) on what he called ""Dead Horse"" topics.  During this week he suggested that we not allow such topics to pervade our subreddit and see if doing so results in a level of discussion that our community finds more satisfying.  We’ve discussed the idea and have decided that next week beginning on Monday (14 May), we shall take measures to turn any Dead Horse Topic into a more meaningful discussion.

We are calling this initiative **”Don’t Beat a Dead Horse – Give a Live Cow!”**

**For eight days – Monday the 14th through Monday the 21st – we will be collecting money to [donate livestock to families in impoverished nations](http://www.worldvision.org/worldvision/eappeal.nsf/egiftgc_cow?OpenForm)**.  It takes $500 to purchase a single dairy-producing cow for a family in a third-world country.  Such a gift not only affords a family the nutritional benefits of the cow’s milk; excess dairy products can also be sold for a second source of income.  Our goal here on /r/Christianity is to raise enough money to buy ten of these cows.  That means we're attempting to raise $5,000... in one week.  (The donation page will remain active beyond the deadline for those who are unable to donate during Dead Horse Week.)

Any Dead Horse Topics posted this week will be met with the following moderator message:

&gt; As of Monday May 14th, posts on this subject and other ""Dead Horse Topics"" will be discouraged for one week. For answers to this question, please visit our FAQ or do a search of previous /r/Christianity posts that have dealt with similar issues.

Beginning that Monday, the message will be replaced with a similar one:

&gt; You have posted a ""Dead Horse Topic!"" For answers to this question, please visit our FAQ or do a search of previous /r/Christianity posts that have dealt with similar issues.

&gt; In the meantime, Don’t Beat a Dead Horse – Give a Live Cow!

We suggest that instead of downvoting these threads you use them to drum up support for our initiative.  Topics to fall under the moratorium would include the following:

- Marijuana

- Homosexuality

- Creationism

- “Honest Questions from Atheists”

- Old Testament Laws

We will be dealing with these on a case-by-case basis: those truly soliciting Christian counsel will not be tagged as Dead Horse Topics while similar DHTs not specifically mentioned above may be.

This is an attempt to urge our community to consider the more meaningful topics than what often make the front page.  By turning our minds away from the things that divide us, we can unite behind a cause that will be truly life-changing for so many.  It will require enthusiastic support from this whole community to raise the amount of money we would like to, so we implore you to consider how you can give when we kick this project off next Monday.  


&gt; “Then the righteous will answer him, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you something to drink? When did we see you a stranger and invite you in, or needing clothes and clothe you? When did we see you sick or in prison and go to visit you?’

A friend of mine was just followed to her car by an old man and yelled at for “being a terrorist” (she’s about 5 foot nothing, so she was particularly freaked out). Other people are reporting similar instances (either being yelled at, stared at, or treated oddly). There were also two guys who were thrown off a plane in Boston for speaking Arabic today.

These abuses aren’t necessarily new, but they have such a huge impact on innocent people, who are just as shaken by yesterday’s events as you are.

So, I’m asking everyone here to keep an eye out, and not be silent when you see harassment or discrimination happening. Even office small talk can ruin someone’s day or week (imagine what you feel like when they say all Christians are bigots).

If my assumptions are right, I won't get excessively downvoted for saying that.

My reason for posting here is because I was wondering if my first thoughts of r/christianity are true. This is my first time in this subreddit and I assumed it would be a Christian version of r/atheism. It wasn't. You strictly post about Jesus Christ and God, whereas r/atheism posts about making jokes of Christians and God.

In real life, I have many atheist friends, but they just don't believe in God, they don't continually speak about how Christians must be idiots for their beliefs.

Is it just r/atheism that 'slags you off'? Or is it just my friends that are not like this? I find you to be a nicer crowd, and whilst I may not stick around in this subreddit I just want to say that there are quite a few Atheists out there who are not demon spawn, just as I am sure there are many Christians that are not shoving religion down our throats.

I would like say again that I am 100% Atheist and I would not like to turn Christian, or follow the Bible in anyway other than to be a generally good person to myself and others. I do assume, however, that I do not have to worry about it as this crowd seems like a generally nice community and I respect your beliefs.

1374355488.0,262,self.Christianity,1iprmp,Satanist or Christian?,PetrineCross,361,99,185,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1iprmp/satanist_or_christian/,"Anton LaVey, author of ""The Satanic Bible"", tells us that to be a Satanist, we need not worship the devil. Rather, a Satanist worships themself as their own god. Satanists work magic rituals through which they attempt to gain things like wealth, love, or revenge. A Satanist's primary concern must be their own welfare. If a Satanist were to utter a prayer, then, it might very well be something like ""Make me rich, make me happy, let me have a great sex life, protect me from bad luck. Give me the job I want, the car I want, give me this and that. Give give give give give.""

It occurs to me that most Christians these days, in churches or in private, pray something like this: ""God, please give me the job I want, the car I want, the love life I want. Please give give give to me me me."" Or, they might pray something like this: ""God, please make this church great and successful in Jesus name. Please cause lots of people to donate and let us increase in members. Please give give give to us us us us us.""

The prayers aren't very different, are they? In fact, by the definition of Satanic Bible, Christians who pray like this would pretty much be Satanists! Even the Christian Bible seems to agree, with Jesus accusing the Pharisees of being ""white-washed tombs"" because, even though they had the appearance of being holy, they were only in it for themselves. They desired the ""high seats"" and ""being called Rabbi""; for them it was all about ""me me me"". This is very strange, considering that Christianity and Satanism should be polar opposites. Let's compare this though to some of the prayers of Jesus: we read that he prayed ""Give us the bread we need for each day, forgive us our sins as we forgive others""; it is never recorded that he particularly prayed for wealth or things of that sort, as he was separate from the world. He also prayed ""Let your will be done hear on earth as it is in heaven."" In another passage, shortly before his crucifixion, he prayed, ""If possible, let this trial pass from me, but not my will, your will.""

Have you spotted the vital difference between the prayers of Christ and these others I mentioned? Christ effectively said to God: if it is your will for me to suffer, I am willing to suffer, because I esteem your will above my own. Do you see that it is not about what God can do for YOU, it never was. It is about what YOU can do for Him.

So how do you pray? Do you pray ""Me me me me me"" like the Satanist? Do you pray ""us us us us us"" like the common church-going Christian, or even the Pharisee? Or, will you pray ""not me, God, but YOU"" like Jesus did? Are you willing to say to God: ""Here is the job I want, and here is the car I want, here is the wealth, or the love life,or the success, or the members of my church, or whatever it is that I deeply desire, but if it is not your will to give me these, please do your will, not mine- I have faith that, like Christ being crucified, this too must be for the greater good."" Or, even better than that, is this: ""God, I only pray that your will be done in this world, and your will be done for me, whether it is to happiness or to suffering, even as Christ or Job suffered. All I ask is that you show me what YOU want from me, because that is more important than anything I, or we, could want from you. Help me to be a better person than I am, for your sake; please teach me to pray in a way that pleases you; please help me to never put anything above you; please keep me from being selfish.""

In the Old Testament a good man utters a prayer to God, something like this: ""make me not too rich, lest I become proud; make me not too poor, lest I steal and disgrace thy name. Only give me enough, that I may serve thee as I ought."" Like Christ, his concern is not for himself, but for God. If he thought he could best serve God poor, he would have prayed ""God, make me poor!"" I wonder how many Christians have prayed to be made poor, so that they can focus more on prayer? Virtually none.

Christians- stop praying for yourselves only! Stop praying for the things *you* want! Stop putting priority on the job, the car, the money, the donations, the social life; let the world seek after these, but as Christians you are called to put God above all. If there is even one thing you are unwilling to give up for God, then that is lukewarmness. You cannot hope to enter a deeper spiritual life.

I will also warn you of this: the blood of Christ is not a free ticket out of being judged for your actions. Christ died so that we could receive forgiveness of sins when we **repent** of them, not so that we could live happy, worldly lives and only put God second. Christ dying on the cross means you can claim forgiveness of sins if you truly repent of them, and are intent on never commiting them again. But if you want to say ""Christ already died for me"" as an excuse to live however you want, then I tell you now there is no forgiveness. None.

As Christians you are not free from judgement; on the contrary your judgement increases because you have the light: more is expected of you. ""You must be better than the Pharisees if you want to enter the kingdom of heaven"".
On God's day of judgement, when he condemns sinners for their selfishness, he will also condemn those sinners who thought they were Christians; ""Did you really take upon yourself the name of Christ, and yet did nothing for my name except what would also benefit yourselves? You are worse than the sinners who never called themselves Christians to begin with.""

Is this you? Are you more concerned about your happy, worldly life than about the things of God? Is T.V. and Internet and entertainment more important to you than humble prayer? Do you spend more time reading Harry Potter than the Word of God? Are you more concerned with serving your church than the Lord? Yes, it's good to serve your church, but would God rather you gave those donations of 10% to a rich church or to the homeless on the street? Would God rather you sung hymns and read Bible verses and hung out with your church-friends on Sundays or that you spend private time alone with him, in solemn prayer? Have you even bothered to ask? If you haven't even bothered to ask, then have you really been living rightly up to now? Have you really been praying in a way and going about your life in a way that pleases God? It's up to you to discover the answer to these and no man can do it for you: it's up to YOU, to pray right NOW, ""God, if I have sinned, I now repent. What do you want from me? I'm willing to do whatever you require; to give up to you whatever you want. Only make me better than I am now."" Perhaps all God wants is for you to spend a few moments in respectful silence.

The main point I want to get across is this: ""The one who gives up his life will find true life, the one who loves this life forsakes true life"" forever. If this makes you uncomfortable or worse yet, angry and bitter, it is a sure sign that maybe you have placed too much value on worldly things, and too little value on God.

While most people do not think it to be an issue, there is a sizable minority that clearly is feeling silenced through use of the downvote button. From my outside perspective, I actually agree that some people are downvoted without good reason. Some people are downvoted with good reason, but many are downvoted without.

How do we solve this? Previously, I went rogue and tried to just CSS things without asking the community or giving my fellow mods appropriate time for feedback (TIL: with this many mods, you need at least a day, I was impatient and gave them less than half a day). So, what can we do to become a more inclusive community? Do people think CSSing the downvote button a good idea? Maybe people will be more willing to be easier on it? Are there other good ideas?

This boy only has a few more weeks to live and his wish before he dies is to get in the Guinness World Record book for getting the most Christmas Cards. His mother said he has 12,500 right now, and needs to hit the 36,000 mark. If you don't have the money to purchase a card from Walgreens or CVS or something... make one at home. Take a couple minutes out of your day to help this boy out. He has a couple weeks left so let's make this happen, and let him accomplish his life goal before Dalton passes away.

I was utterly wrong. As Christians, we need to remember that it is not in the nature of the gospel to be bloodthirsty or to seek out, hope for, or rejoice in vengeance. Vengeance is the Lord's, and if vengeance is to be taken upon Osama bin Laden, then it is none of our concern. And if vengeance is not to be taken upon him, let us all be prepared to greet bin Laden with open arms as a brother in Christ should we meet him after our own deaths.

Let us lift up Osama bin Laden in prayer and also his family, as they mourn the loss of a loved one.

I wanted to do a post to sort of lighten up the mood here. For the Christians and others religious alignments here, what do you do as a hobby that people do not expect your religion to enjoy? For visiting Atheist (don’t want you to be left out!), what are some hobbies that would surprise you to see a Christian enjoy? 

As a Baptist, I usually get strange looks when I tell people (atheist, Baptist, and other believers) that I want to publish a post-apocalypse and fantasy book (both in which are quite violent and have some cursing). Also, I love playing video games of all types from Call of Duty to Mass Effect to Skyrim. My favorite television shows are Walking Dead and Being Human. My music choices possess various degrees of genres besides gospel and I’m a huge fan of Disturbed. And the kicker, I want to learn mixed martial arts (there are more believers than you may know in the sport).  

But when I tell people all of that, I usually get the “are you sure you are Christian?” look.  I’m pretty much open to anything if I don’t believe it would hurt me spiritually. 

So please share some of your hobbies that people don’t really expect you to do.

So it's no surprise that people who dare to speak the truth on reddit end up with negative comment karma.  I certainly don't care about Reddit's notion of ""karma"", but upvotes and downvotes are useful because they allow us to measure the groupthink that has pervaded the forum.

For example, take a look at the recent [""Views of people who are not male or female?"" thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/vu4jb/views_of_people_who_are_not_male_or_female/).
The (atheist) OP asked ""This is a question to Christians who are against gay marriage... What are your thoughts on people who are neither male or female [as it relates to marriage]?""

This OP specifically asked for the opinions of people who oppose gay marriage.  So people who oppose gay marriage - myself included - provided their perspectives, and were summarily downmodded into oblivion and berated for doing so.

In response to a question directed at people who oppose gay marriage, I said that ""[marriage is the union of one man and one woman](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/vu4jb/views_of_people_who_are_not_male_or_female/c57n743)"" and was downmodded to -20.

That is absurd.  Does it surprise people on this forum that people who oppose gay marriage think marriage is between one man and one woman?

The groupthink on this forum has resulted in people reaching misguided consensus with very little thought or investigation, and without stopping for even a minute to consider what the Bible teaches.

The irony, of course, is that the people who pretend to be the most tolerant are actually the *least*.

**NOTE:** *Some people say at comments say that evolution is not beautiful because it's cruel. Well: first, I'm talking about the theory, not the process itself, which can be ""cruel"".

It's just a pie-in-the-sky, long-shot idea from your feckless friend keatsandyeats. But I've been turning it over in my mind since our charity drive and can't shake it - so I had no other choice but to bring it to you.

**What if we started our own 501(c)(3) charity, founded in our community, with a mission of meeting the physical and spiritual needs of those in need?**

Hear me out.  We are a community of 33,000 people.  We are growing.  But we lack a central mission.  I've written articles about why web communities are hotbeds for unbelief, and I think it's because until now, atheists haven't had a commonly shared intellectual freespace to exchange rhetoric.  The internet is literally their church.  But here's the thing that gets me, guys.  **This is also our church.** This is where we come to be fed spiritually.  This is where we come to share the gospel.  This is where we come to interact with people of a like mind. If there's one thing that we share in common, in spite of our wildly different beliefs, it is the belief that the poor, hungry, tired, oppressed, weary, weak deserve justice.  

Am I not right?  Atheist or Christian, liberal or conservative, young or old, Protestant or Catholic or Orthodox ... don't we *all* want to see that those who are in desperate need of a helping hand get the aid they deserve? *And, don't we want to be the community that takes it upon itself to be that helping hand?*

Listen, I don't know the first thing about getting something like this off the ground.  It's just an idea.  But I know that in a community this large, some of you would be willing to volunteer.  Some of you would be willing to leave what you do to help run such an organization.  There has to be someone here with a degree in charity administration, someone with the funding to get us started, someone who could help develop and maintain our web presence. I am convinced that the Holy Spirit drew each and every one of us here for a reason - for some, it's just to lurk and read, or to leave a comment now and again. For others, He brought our unique gifts and our desire to serve here so that we could meet the needs of a lost world.

Let me throw out a figure.  If each of us gave fifteen cents a day to such an organization - about fifty-five bucks a year - we would raise 1.8 million dollars a year.  Now, will every one of our 33,000 readers step up to the plate?  No.  But for those that do, fifty-five bucks a year won't be the threshold.  Some of us could pledge that much a month.  Heck, some of us could give five hundred bucks a month.  And those who can only offer fifteen cents - think of how God would multiply those gifts!

One small commitment.  Fifteen cents a day from each of us.  1.8 million dollars a year for the needy. 

I know.  It's big.  It's huge.  If it doesn't work, it doesn't work, and we can put it to bed without any hard feelings.  I'll be the first to admit that I have no clue, beyond the initial idea, how we would make something like this work.  But it was eating at me, and so I had to throw it out there.

Hi guys, I promised an update...and thusly, I deliver. Some absolutely crazy stuff has gone down since my last post. The holidays were...insane. 

You see, I have a brother who has completely gone down the wrong path. Constantly in trouble with the law, drug user, can't keep a job, you get the general idea. Well, he came over to visit during the holidays, and he and my mother got into a massive fight. Inside my house. In front of my kids. I stepped between the two and told them both to either cut it out, or leave. My mother screamed at me for a bit about how unChristianlike I was, and then stormed out. She didn't speak to me for days, but when she did...she started calling me up multiple times a day and lectured me on how we were all going to hell for our behavior, and how I wasn't ""following the Bible on respecting your parents"". I got to hear the lovely 'vulture verse' about it as well. 

Eventually, my husband snapped. He literally went to her house, and told her that if anyone was being unChristian...it was her. And that she needed to now stay away from our family, until she could be respectful towards us. 

You can imagine how that went. If not, imagine potassium and water meeting.

After everyone cooled their tempers a bit...I mediated a meetup between my husband and my mother...and the talk went pretty well. My husband explained to her that we were BOTH getting quite fed up with the constant belittlement that we were all going to Hell for this, and for that...and that she needed to stop. 

To all of our surprise, she agreed to stop mentioning it. She went on a bit of a mini-rant about how she couldn't stand it, every time she came to our house she saw ""all the filth, all the secular stuff"". She then accused me of ""harassing her and trying to drag her down"". Her reason behind this was a comment I'd made once that if she'd just try an MMO out with us, she'd see it wasn't 'of the devil'. Apparently that has been a major fuel source for her increasing attacks on us. 

I tried to talk to her about it, but my husband just told me to leave it alone. 

In the end, we laid out some ground rules: she needs to respect us more, and if she is going to start up the ""you're going to hell for all of this"" again...she needs to leave. Immediately. We are not going to stand for that any more. I even stated that if she DID violate these rules, and continued to do so, that I had no compunctions about contacting her pastor, and having him talk to her. 

She's respected the rules thus far, thankfully....we had one incident last month though where she found out that my husband had rented the first Harry Potter movie for me to watch. (I've never read the books, nor seen the movies, due to her raising me to believe it was pure witchcraft and satanism. I'm serious.) However...I simply told her to drop it, and asked if she needed to 'call back at another time'. She literally stopped midword....made some vague angry noises....and then dropped it.

So....maybe there's hope. Not that she'll ever believe we aren't on a path straight to the dark side, that is...but it's a start. And I'll take anything I can get, at this point. :P 

But...thank you guys. I really appreciated all the support from my last thread, and the great ideas. Y'all were right, standing up, and laying some ground rules, worked. I'm going to just continue to pray for her at this point, and try to respect her boundaries...and just see what happens. =)

It’s vitally important, especially as Christians, to remember to ground ourselves on what is observable and understood (or, becoming more understood), even though we have a convicted faith in what isn’t very observable or understood.
We are understanding more and more than emotions aren’t magical. They are our experiences of physiological activity in our bodies, of which our brains are a part.

We are also understanding more and more the absolutely pivotal role played by the neurotransmitter “dopamine.” Dopamine stimulation is like pattern recognition nitro — it’s all about hopeful expectations and deciphering patterns in service thereof.

* [Take a look at this 3 minute clip from neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XvwcyIrYAwQ)

Dopamine underpins almost everything we consider entertaining and/or psychologically addictive: rhyming, jokes, gambling, hoarding, story twists, conspiracy theories, wonder/awe, mysteries, chord progressions (I-V-vi-IV is perhaps the most resonant progression ever for Western listeners because of its cyclical and dramatic rising and falling), video games, watching sports, turning pages, etc.

When something is wrong with your dopamine transmission, it can cause life-altering problems. Parkinson’s disease is the most well-known, where the cells that generate dopamine die. The shaking typical of Parkinson’s, restless leg syndrome, and shaking when afraid are all related to dopamine deficiency or over-stimulation.

Chronic depression is a neurotransmitter problem, often related to dopamine (among other neurotransmitters, e.g., serotonin) issues. When the ability to create hopeful expectations is hobbled or killed, then everything turns hopeless. Our conscious brains *respond* to this crippling problem by dwelling on the unclaimable, like the nostalgic past, and concluding nonsensical or irrational conclusions, like that a future full of potential is actually bleak.

This isn’t something that you can “think your way out of.” You can “think your way **through** and **during**,” as people with Parkinson's do every day, but your thoughts don’t (typically) *cause* alleviation. Alleviation comes through physiological treatment (like medicine that stimulates neurotransmitters), or through natural remedial brain activity (which makes depression merely temporary for some people).

Persistent depression is a *chemical issue*, as “non-magical” as Parkinson’s and RLS, but it has the sinister symptom of convincing us that it IS something in our “magical minds.”

* We must avoid jumping to superstitious conclusions, like ""Superstitious"" Steve.

* We must avoid treating all brain activity as a libertarian product of conscious will, like ""Buck-Stops-Here"" Buck.

* We must avoid pretending like the brain is magical and can reason itself out of various thoughts and behaviors, like ""Dualistic Philosophy"" Sophia.

I used to be a very conservative Christian until I started dating my atheist boyfriend, who I've been with for a year and a half. The beginning of May, I found out I was pregnant; the child was 6 weeks old when I had the abortion.

The thing is, my parents are extremely controlling. They do not know I'm sexually active and are very much unsupportive of my relationship. Basically, if they knew what was going on in my life, they would kick me out of the house and stop paying for my college tuition.

I feel like complete and utter shit about what I did. I feel like shit about constantly needing to lie to my parents, going so far as to abort my child to keep up that lie. I've lost a lot of faith over time, and am reluctant to try going back to God, because I know that I love my boyfriend more and could never place God above my relationship.

When he talks about his disagreements, he's careful not to offend me and truly cares about what I think about things. He has even considered breaking up with me so that I might be happier spiritually, but the fact is, he is someone I never want to shut out of my life, whether I return to God or not. It is not his fault that I have fallen away spiritually, it's because of my own desire for things above God.

A few years ago, I became an atheist and recently a few philosophical realizations have really opened my up to the plausibility of God's existence. 

I can't help but feel attracted to Christianity but I also continue to see many problems with Christianity. The thing is, I suspect these problems I see are with the particular brand of Christianity that I've been exposed to and perhaps there are positions that are consistent with Christianity that I might be more able to understand.

Here are some examples:

* **Evolution** happens. I'm talkin' at the macro level - speciation and everything. This is a fact. Yet the Bible outlines a 6 day creation. I'm aware that there are various interpretations of Genesis that might allow for the truth of macro-evolution. Maybe you guys have some recommended sources?

* **Patriarchy** appears to be reinforced by Christian doctrine. Many will say that women are equal to men, but simply play a different role. This is an obviously patriarchal perspective posing as egalitarian. I believe that women are not only equal to men, but can also play the same roles. If a man can be a theological leader, disciple, prophet, pastor, priest, what-have-you, then I see no reason why a woman cannot. I also feel that many of our tendencies, such as the pressure men feel to be financial supporters and to be masculine, as well as the pressure women feel to be beautiful and nurturing, are at least to some degree, culturally instilled rather than natural and instinctive.

* **The Bible as infallible.** The Bible was written by men and is therefore fallible. Are there any Christian traditions that admit this?

What I'm looking for are resources. I would like to find Christian traditions that may be compatible with these viewpoints of mine. My only exposure to Christianity thus far would contradict these three beliefs.

You were all so nice when I came here after coming back to Christianity from atheism and it really is nice to have a place to have a spiritual moment or discussion, even if for a little bit a day, because most of my friends are very hostile to religion. So just always like to be appreciative. 



Secondly, I found a church home. It’s a Lutheran congregation, very small, mostly gray haired. I sadly won’t be able to be with them long since I’m leaving to move a long way off for a job in August. I looked into my options in the place I’m moving to and the same thing: mostly stagnant churches in this denomination I’ve chosen. So why did I? Why didn’t I go back to my Catholic past or join a thriving denomination? Well the main reason is that after a lot of prayer and study I just simply love Lutheranism. The confessions and the movements within it are deeply inspiring and intellectually rich. The Book of Concord, Neo-Lutheranism, Pietism, all of it. I’m just called by it and I find myself in agreement with it. I truly do. I find that when I want to read something theological I consistently am going back to Lutheranism. Also, my love of apostolic Christian unity may be deep but my spirit is calling me elsewhere and so I give it up to God. Like Luther at Worms: “I can do no other. God help me! Amen.” Also, my parents are coming back to Church again because of my reversion to Christianity, so amen to that!



But most of all I’m not going to let the decline of mainline Protestantism scare me into doing something I don’t feel called to do. If I truly feel this is right for me then I should engage this church and work for change. Running away from a challenge isn’t my game. So many people I talk to in mainline denoms are saddened by the decline but few are those who will do anything to save it. To love something is to fight for it. Revival can happen. I’ve seen it. I believe it. We’ve got a lot of history to learn from. We just have to draw from it. From Presbyterian seminaries with brilliant Barth scholars to rich Lutheran choir tradition to Wesleyan holiness living. These are powerful wells from which to draw a renewal. 



Yes churches will shrink and yes we may feel trapped and pushed to irrelevancy but far be it for Christians of all people to get all hopeless. I am firm in the belief that the mainline denoms will survive. Somewhere in a Lutheran mission a woman with a smile and a cross on her neck will welcome a meth addict and bring blankets for him when he shakes in the night and screams the demons out of himself, grinding his teeth to dust and perhaps…uttering a prayer. Somewhere a Methodist man will dole out soup and bread to hustlers and needle junkies who are absolutely convinced that no one on this Earth loves them. Somewhere a Presbyterian preschool will teach children to love God and neighbor in kindness and joy. Somewhere an Episcopalian priest will baptize an ex-prostitute and welcome her into the family of God. 



And in all of this the mainline denoms will carry on preaching Word and Sacrament. The lost will know that the cross of Christ is theirs to claim. They’ll know that Jesus can pour out grace and free them from the bondage of sin. They’ll know that the saints will judge the world and that they too can be a saint.



So consider this not only a flair change but a word to all those dismayed that their traditions, so deeply loved, are shrinking. There’s always hope. Always. So let's get out and work for it!

People seemed very positive about the idea so I thought now that Global reddit Meetup Day is now less than two months away (15th of June) it might be worth thinking seriously if people would be up for this.

What do you guys think? Obviously since we're a worldwide community we'd have to think about whether multiple meetups in different countries would be feasible. Also does anyone have any ideas on what we could do during these meetups? The two best suggestions from the original thread were some kind of charitable service such as helping clear a garden or decorate a room (Here in the UK there's a charity called [Besom](http://www.besom.com/about-us) that does the kind of thing I was thinking), and an act of worship of some kind, whether that's a Communion service, time of prayer or discussion of a particular topic.

Self post = no karma so upvotes for visibility would be good.

*EDIT: Interesting people are comparing this to church. I suppose there are a lot of similarities really but that's not to say at least organising a meetup and getting to know the people that hang out here is a bad idea. We could do almost anything during the day, I was just echoing a couple of suggestions that were made before.

But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared,  he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.

I'm writing this because a lot of churches have Superbowl parties. A lot of Churches order pizza. 

I'm going to ask you to talk about this subject with whomever's ordering today. 

Now, it's bad enough that we Christians have a reputation for being miserly and for being demanding restaurant customers and for being terrible tippers. And now, that horrible story about a *Pastor* who is such a horrible witness, displaying none of the Fruits of the Spirit that we are supposed to be showing to the world.

Consider these scriptures: 

* 1 Timothy 5:18 ESV For the Scripture says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,” and, “The laborer deserves his wages.”
* Leviticus 19:13 Do not defraud or rob your neighbor. ‘Do not hold back the wages of a hired worker overnight.
* There's more, but I'm not going to go on... 

(Full Disclosure: My husband is a pizza driver, still taking a few classes while he's working. I'm an unemployed teacher. I wasn't expecting to be unemployed, I'm working a few jobs, but his is the only steady job between the two of us.)

Dine-in servers typically earn between $2.15-$3.15 an hour. Delivery drivers, about $5.15 an hour. Some major chains give the driver a measly 20 cents a mile, though some places give a dollar a run -- this barely covers gas, much less wear and tear on the car. Drivers use their own car, pay for their own gas, maintenance and car insurance. 

*Your tips make a difference.* A slim day and a good day is the difference between paying a bill this month or digging change out of the couch to give to the gas station clerk. It's the difference between a decent week of meals with fresh fruits and veggies or ramen noodles every night. It makes a difference on whether we can pay anything but the car insurance bill or not. 

The drivers at my husband's workplace have plenty of stories about how the people with the ""JESUS IS THE REASON FOR THE SEASON"" lights in the front yard during Christmas are the people who give the 67 cent tip from the $19.33 order (or ask for the change back and give *no* tip). 

He's dropped off many $90+ deliveries to churches for parties and gotten *stiffed.* No tip. A few times he made two trips for very large orders, orders well over $100, even with advance orders at a sweetheart bulk rate -- a $2 tip. How is THAT being a good witness? It's NOT. 

Please talk about this situation with your pastors and fellow church members. 

Every time a person with a cross around their neck or a crucifix on the wall shuts the door, stiffing their delivery driver, you tell that person that *you don't care about them.* 

I understand that some folks don't know tip etiquette. We can fix that. [This website here, written by a delivery driver](http://tipthepizzaguy.com) is actually rather useful. A lot of folks just don't understand. That's what I love about Reddit. We learn, we share, we teach. 

Be a good witness with your generosity.

Even though my parents had divorced several years earlier, my dad was always there for me. So naturally, when he was taken from us (I have two older siblings, a sister and a brother, who were away at college at the time, and a younger brother) I was upset, but I had to set my feelings aside and be the man of the house. I learned that I had to be strong when no one else was. So it was then that I really learned how God could be my Heavenly Father.

Before my parents divorced, my father was a pastor. And after he passed, we found all of the Bibles he used over the years among his belongings. Each of us (my siblings and I) chose one as a keepsake. And one night about a month later when I was really missing him, I opened up that Bible to a random page, and it landed on Psalms 77, which just so happened to be circled in blue ink. Knowing that this chapter had impacted my dad at one point, I read it over.

&gt; I cried out to God for help;
    I cried out to God to hear me.
 When I was in distress, I sought the Lord;
    at night I stretched out untiring hands, 
    and I would not be comforted.
 I remembered you, God, and I groaned; 
    I meditated, and my spirit grew faint. 
 You kept my eyes from closing;
    I was too troubled to speak. 
 I thought about the former days, 
    the years of long ago;
 I remembered my songs in the night.
    My heart meditated and my spirit asked:
 “Will the Lord reject forever? 
    Will he never show his favor again?
 Has his unfailing love vanished forever?
    Has his promise failed for all time?
 Has God forgotten to be merciful? 
    Has he in anger withheld his compassion? ”
 Then I thought, “To this I will appeal:
    the years when the Most High stretched out his right hand. 
 I will remember the deeds of the Lord;
    yes, I will remember your miracles of long ago.
 I will consider all your works
    and meditate on all your mighty deeds.”
 Your ways, God, are holy.
    What god is as great as our God? 
 You are the God who performs miracles; 
    you display your power among the peoples.
 With your mighty arm you redeemed your people, 
    the descendants of Jacob and Joseph.
 The waters saw you, God,
    the waters saw you and writhed; 
    the very depths were convulsed.
 The clouds poured down water, 
    the heavens resounded with thunder; 
    your arrows flashed back and forth.
 Your thunder was heard in the whirlwind, 
    your lightning lit up the world;
    the earth trembled and quaked. 
 Your path led through the sea, 
    your way through the mighty waters,
    though your footprints were not seen.
 You led your people like a flock 
    by the hand of Moses and Aaron.

Although it takes many forms, a perennial point of discussion here at /r/Christianity has been, at its essence, what level of moderation is necessary to maintain the kind of community that we want.  The discussion has ranged from [accusations that we censor and ban indiscriminately](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/fy941/an_open_letter_to_rchristianity_and_its/) to the recent post prompting this message that asked if our sub [has ""morphed into /r/DebateAChristian""](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/mtfs7/well_i_guess_rchristianity_has_basically_morphed/).

A brief history on the subject is in order since Reddit's collective memory rivals Reagan's, God bless him, in his twilight years. 

- Two years ago smacfarl [tried to address the problem](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/90e4i/from_the_moderator_this_is_not_a_playground_for/) of this sub becoming a ""playground for atheistic evangelism.""  

- Our [Community Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianityPolicy/comments/cixs8/community_policy_for_rchristianity/) was developed to clarify some of the behaviors that result in moderator intervention.  

- When the arguments got out of control, [/r/DebateAChristian was created](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/csbdj/announcement_from_the_moderatorsdue_to_the/).

- We were subsequently, and repeatedly, [called out for censorship](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/e7ddj/moderator_announcement_thank_you_partofaplan_for/) or [asked for intervention](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/mtfs7/well_i_guess_rchristianity_has_basically_morphed/), each when when we only attempted to follow the Community Policy.

- Last month, we urged a [review of our subreddit rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/lpp2o/moderator_announcement_a_brief_review_of/) in response to the declining quality of posts related to Christianity.  (The primary audience and primary topic of this sub.)

The long version involves headhunts, puppet accounts, whole subreddits dedicated to our abuses, spin-off subs attempting to build atheist-free communities.  Nevertheless, we have consistently taken a middle approach to moderation: **we only step in when downvotes are not effectively regulating negative content**.  The best defense against trolls is to downvote them and ignore them while upvoting good content.  (This doesn't always work - today's popular [Darrin Rasberry post demonstrates](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/mw1lb/darrin_rasberry_former_contributor_to_debunking/) that there are plenty of lurking atheists *and* Christians who will simply downvote an opinion that opposes their own.)

So far we've found that Reddit simply lacks the structure for a rigid set of guidelines to be helpful.  For instance, we allow posting to personal blogs, but discourage using the sub solely for that purpose.  Another example is that people are always finding new ways to troll that aren't covered in our Community Policy, so we have to deal with them on a case-by-case basis.  It's the Wild West with the exception that in the Wild West, you can put a repeat offender in jail; here, the worst you can do is ban *one account*, and there's nothing stopping an angry Redditor from making a dozen puppet accounts and continuing to troll.

Bearing all of the above in mind, I will cut to the chase and ask:

**How much moderation do you really want?**

Are there behaviors that we can more effectively curb?  What role do you want us to play in regulating comments or content?  Do you have suggestions for rules that are not in place but you feel are necessary?  Please discuss below; we will read all the comments, answer any questions, and develop a plan based on the sentiments of the community.  I'm not exactly sure how that will work logistically, maybe it'll come to a vote or something.  For what it's worth, this community belongs to you.  We're only your servants.  We are prepared to do whatever needs to be done for you to feel that you maintain ownership of the community.

A good friend can heal some of the deepest wounds and they can also inflict some of the deepest wounds.

And looking at how Jesus and the disciples interacted, it's easy to see that Jesus was a good friend and could be honest, yet real in many ways. The disciples themselves hung out together a lot, but we don't necessarily have much light shed on their dialogue with one another. It would've been kind of neat to see how James and John interacted or Peter and James or Thomas and John, etc. 

Anyway, the point of this post is to encourage us to cultivate real friendships, because you can't really serve someone and have them know you're being real about it unless you actually take time to build a friendship with that person. Being a good friend is more than just hanging out, but being willing to mature and grow with that person. To speak no ill or to demean their problems, but to display all the fruits of the Spirit in conversation and time. 

I hear a lot of people talk about ""sin"" and how it must be purged from the midst of community and of the congregation, but you know what...I don't think it was ever God's intention that someone who is **diseased** by sin should be thrown outside the circle, rather that the circle should absolutely drown the sin in love and encouragement. The church should be the safest place in the world to be vulnerable and real. 

EDIT: Let me be clear here...if someone is doing something illegal or endangering the community, then the person won't be able to participate in the group, but that should not stop people from going to them, visiting them in jail and loving them. Their behavior does not excuse you from being Jesus to that person.",,False,,t5_2qh6c,True,,chirho,True,t3_tcwiv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/tcwiv/being_a_good_friend_is_probably_the_best_way_to/,

The DOMA decision was just released, and reporters are reading it right now.  

If you would please keep your discussion of gay marriage and the SCOTUS decision to THIS THREAD for the next 24 hours, we, the mods, would greatly appreciate it.  We don't want 2 dozen gay marriage threads today.

**Edit the first**: [Apparently, the DOMA was struck down.](http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2013/06/26/supreme-court/?hpt=hp_t1)

**Edit the second**: adding Wikipedia links for the Defense of Marriage Act and Proposition 8, so that those that don't follow American politics know what we're talking about here.

**Edit the third**: Proposition 8 was overturned, but other states' similar bans may remain.  The reason is because the group presenting the case for Proposition 8 did not have standing to argue the case before the Supreme Court.  It's a narrow decision that sidesteps the bigger question on the grounds of procedure.  (See original link, which is CNN's liveblog on the gay marriage rulings.)

**Edit the fourth**: We have texts of the decisions on [the Defense of Marriage Act](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/12pdf/12-307_g2bh.pdf) and [Proposition 8](http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/june-web-only/supreme-court-proposition-8-doma-decision.html), for those interested.

1368454089.0,200,self.Christianity,1e8t8q,Theology AMA - Calvinism,tphelan88,244,44,1381,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1e8t8q/theology_ama_calvinism/,"Good morning brothers and sisters.  Today is the Calvinism edition of the Theology AMA series!  /u/rev_run_d, /u/average650, and myself will be answering your questions about the theology known as Calvinism.

Calvinism is a theology based on the teachings of John Calvin (1509-1564), a French lawyer who was converted and became a theologian who lived in the 16th century.  Following the first reformers such as Martin Luther, Jan Huss, and John Wycliffe, Calvin believed that the Roman Catholic Church had become corrupt and had departed from Biblical truth.  A follower of the Augustinian tradition, Calvin expounded on the topics of predestination and the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation.  Calvin’s most famous work is *Institutes of the Christian Religion*. 

In the first decade of the 1600’s a controversy arose in the Dutch Reformed Church over a theologian named Jacob Arminius who opposed many of Calvin’s doctrines.  Those who followed Arminius (known as Arminians) had produced a list of objections against the Calvinist doctrines which were called The Remonstrance of 1610.  In 1618 a council was formed in the city of Dordrecht, Netherlands to settle the matter of Arminianism.  The council became known as the Synod of Dort.  The result of the synod was the condemnation of the Remonstrance, and Arminianism.  The Synod drafted a response to the Remonstrance, known as the Canons of Dort which is summarized by the Acronym TULIP, commonly known as the Five Points of Calvinism. The Five Points are as follows:  1) Total Depravity 2) Unconditional Election 3) Limited Atonement 4) Irresistible Grace 5) Perseverance of the Saints.

The so-called Five Points became the central doctrines of what we today know as Calvinism.  The Reformed Church and Presbyterians are the two major subscribers to Calvinistic theology.  Many other Baptist denominations and non-denominational churches also adopted Calvinistic theology.

The following is a brief outline of the Five Points

**Total Depravity** – or Radical Depravity, is a consequence of the fall of man into sin.  As a result of our ancestor’s sin and Adam’s headship of the human race, every human is born a slave to sin (Romans 5:12-14, 6:6).  People by nature are not inclined to love God, but instead follow their own interests and to reject the rule of God and are by nature objects of God’s wrath (Ephesians 2:1-3).  This radical depravity affects every aspect of one’s being, making it impossible for man, in his natural faculties, choose to follow God and to redeem himself.  Our every thought, word, and deed is stained by sin, making even our good deeds as filthy rags before God’s holiness (Isaiah 64:6).  Any impetus to awaken a spiritually dead sinner must therefore come from God.

**Unconditional Election** – God has chosen from eternity past those whom He will bring to Himself, not based on foreseen virtue, merit, or faith in these people; rather, His choice is unconditionally grounded in His mercy alone (Ephesians 1:5,6).  Those not chosen receive the just wrath that is warranted for their sins.  Free will is still affirmed. There is seen to be no contradiction between free will and unconditional election. We have free wills, but we did not choose our will; it was given to us. So, while we choose whatever we wish under no intervention or compulsion outside ourselves (free will), God, because He has created everything and set the universe in motion, has still set the end from the beginning.

**Limited Atonement** – Or “Particular Atonement/Definite Atonement” asserts that Jesus’ substitutionary atonement was definite and certain in its purpose and in what it accomplished.  Only the sins of the elect were atoned for by Jesus’ death.  This is not to say that the atonement is limited in value or power, but rather that the atonement is limited in the sense that it is intended for some, not all.  It is sufficient for all and efficient for the elect.

**Irresistible Grace** – The saving grace of God is effectually applied to those whom God has determined to be saved (the elect) and overcomes their resistance to obeying the call of the gospel, bringing them to saving faith.  This means that when God sovereignly pursues and purposes a person to be saved, that individual will certainly be saved.

**Perseverance of the Saints** – Since God is sovereign and His purposes and will cannot be overthrown or frustrated by humans or any other power (Romans 8:31-39) those who fall away from faith either never had true saving faith or will one day return of God’s flock.

**TL;DR**  We're Calvinists, Ask us Anything!

**EDIT** Wow, almost 400 comments in 3 hours!  I am exhausted and need to take a break.  Keep commenting and hopefully my other chosen and highly-favored brothers and sisters will answer.

In many places they only make about $2 an hour.  These people also have to tip out bussers and bartender based solely on sales.  So if you have a group of 6 people eating and the tab is $150... The server will have to tip out 2% just to the bussers. So that's $3 for them having to serve that table. If there is no tip, just a pamphlet, it will cost that person money to be your server.  

I am not trying to mean or incite-full, I'm just curious as to the thought process.  I live in the south(not deep, but the south) and I see this happen on a daily basis, with Sundays being the worst.  It's almost as if they are assuming these people are lacking faith for working on Sunday.  

As good intentioned as it may seem to be, stiffing a person and leaving a church pamphlet is the exact opposite way to bring someone into the church.  It just brings resentment, from what I have seen.

I'd like to do another one and maybe do it in a more orderly fashion so people can have questions ready.

The way I'd like it to be done is have certain days scheduled between now and the end of July for people to come in and post an AMA. 

So, if you're Eastern Orthodox, or Baptist, or Mennonite, etc, let's setup a day for you to take time to answer questions about your faith and doctrine. 

As for atheists and people of other religions, you're welcome to. For atheists, if you are a specific type (e.g. humanist, nihilist, Nietszchean, etc.) that might be most interesting. 

What do you guys think?

**EDIT** Given the growing interest let's do it this way... 

1. State the **denomination/belief system** you'd like to represent. Please be as specific as possible. 
2. State the **date** you'd like to post (before July 31st).
3. We'll upvote the top ones and I'll create a calendar for the mods.

**EDIT 2** Wow! I go away for a few hours and I'm overwhelmed! Since there are some questions about who will represent which denomination, I'm thinking we should do this differently. How about we have certain people lead a discussion and if there's more than one perspective on the denomination we can have separate AMAs, but I'll let you guys work that out amongst yourself.

~~I'll start a new thread in a few minutes with a set calendar.~~

But half of the people decided to down vote it. I was home alone when I learned about my grandma breaking her back so I asked for prayer for her. One guy decided to post a song called Go Forth and Die. Are you freaking serious...?

So apparently asking for prayer isn't accepted here. When you post about God's works in your life, you get shot down with half a dozen arguments right off the bat about how stupid you must be to believe that was from God. I posted about getting a new job and how happy I was and I get crap from atheists left right and center about having low self esteem and not giving credit to the people hiring me. I got 3 private messages telling me off for praising God when it clearly didn't have anything to do with Him. What?? On a Christian site, I'm getting this junk?

I am seeing more and more of it. r/Christianity seems to be dying or something. And I can compare because I also post in a different Christian subreddit and it's *entirely* different. They encourage prayer requests, want to hear praise reports and have actual discussions without some rude jerk squawking in the background.

A few things you should be aware of,

 * [**We are a moderated community.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/XtianityPolicy/comments/nw0w4/community_policy_last_update_12032010/) As a community that represents a minority position on Reddit, the self-moderation provided by upvoting and downvoting is not always in and of itself sufficient. By reading our [community policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/XtianityPolicy/comments/nw0w4/community_policy_last_update_12032010/) you can better understand the guidelines by which we moderate. 

 * [**We have a FAQ!**](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/christianity) A lot of questions get asked ad nauseum. While not perfect, [the FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/christianity) will give you a better feel for this community, point you to previous discussions, and better prepare you for interaction with the regular users here. It's fine to ask a question addressed in the FAQ, but it's helpful if you at least check to see what's offered there first.

 * [**Please search before asking a question.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/search?q=&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance) We get questions about gay marriage, evolution, marijuana, the epicurean paradox, and the Old Testament weekly. Sometimes daily. If you can find a recent discussion, it's always better to join that discussion than to start a new one.

 * [**Please use descriptive titles in your posts.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/o6c3m/an_honest_request_from_an_honest_moderator_to_all/) This just ensures that submissions are searchable. Instead of posting ""I have an honest question for the Christians here..."", please post, ""I have a question for the Christians here about hell and God's omnipotence..."" or even better, ""If God doesn't desire that anyone should go to hell (2 Peter 3:9), and is all powerful, how could you believe that anyone goes to hell?"" The last option is much more searchable.

 * [**Our flair system is a little different.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/jugnq/user_flair_automation/) Follow [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/jugnq/user_flair_automation/) link if you want to set your flair. The scarlet ""A"" was chosen by atheists on /r/Christianity and is not meant to be negative commentary on the atheists in our community (once in a while we get people misunderstanding this).

 * [**Heated debates belong in /r/DebateReligion.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/) While questions are fine, intentionally antagonistic heated debates are not. Debates are better suited to /r/DebateReligion.

 * [**You likely take water for granted, but for many people it changes everything.**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCHhwxvQqxg?y=z) Dirty water kills more people than all forms of violence; including war. Every 20 seconds a child dies from a water related disease. You can do something about this. Consider giving to [CharityWater](http://www.charitywater.org), [20liters](http://www.20liters.org), [Living Water International](http://www.water.cc/), or even [/r/Christianity's clean water fund with World Vision](http://www.firstgiving.com/rchristianity).

Indeed only by myth-making, only by becoming 'sub-creator' and inventing stories, can Man aspire to the state of perfection that he knew before the Fall. Our myths may be misguided, but they steer however shakily towards the true harbour, while materialistic 'progress' leads only to a yawning abyss and the Iron Crown of the power of evil.” ― J.R.R. Tolkien

While it is not as widely known, Tolkien was a devout catholic. C.S. Lewis gets very much attention on this subredit and i though it was time to bring up Tolkien who helped convert C.S. Lewis. This is one of his quotes that is very directly about his faith but many of his other great quotes could be interpreted in a spirtual way,

 ""Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens.”

“The Road goes ever on and on
Down from the door where it began.
Now far ahead the Road has gone,
And I must follow, if I can,
Pursuing it with eager feet,
Until it joins some larger way
Where many paths and errands meet.
And whither then? I cannot say”

“End? No, it doesn’t end here. Death is just another path, one which we must all take. The grey rain-curtain of this world rolls back, and all change to silver glass… And then you see it… White shores, and beyond, a far green country, under a swift sunrise.”

I look at these quotes and i See that they relate greatly to our faith and they are beautifully said. If you want to read more about one Christians thoughts on Tolkien, LOTR and how they relate to Christianity this is a good article.

They were apparently having a guest speaker and a series of ""gospel meetings"" all week long. So, we decided to go. It was a local CoC congregation, and really all I knew about CoC was that a lot of them don't use instruments in their worship. My husband and I both went to the same Baptist private school as children. My mom is AoG and my dad is more of a Christian Universalist. I was also involved in a campus student ministry in college that really focuses on evangelizing to non-believers. Apart from going to school, my husband didn't go to church, though his mom's side of the family is Catholic. So, from our experiences, we both felt like we were Christians, and we were at the time attending a non-denominational church in our town.

Well, we get to the church, and when I walk in, I realize from the start how out of place I was. I was the only female in the building wearing jeans. I wasn't dressed sloppily or anything, but I was wearing pants, and that got me some glances. The speaker was a wiry, sensationalist little man. He looked maybe in his thirties but spoke like one of those old, impassioned hell-fire and brimstone types. I remember one of the things he mentioned was praying for someone who had died recently, because even though he had accepted Christ on his deathbed, he hadn't been baptized and was now in hell. 

After the sermon, people around the church came and talked to us a bit. There were lots of people who were telling us ""I used to be a Mormon..."" or ""I used to be a Baptist..."" and how after they became CoC they had to stop affiliating with their family and friends because they didn't share their beliefs. Once again, I was a little put off, but I just smiled and nodded because they were trying to be friendly. 

We went over to my husband's friend's house after church. There were a few other couples there apart from us and we had a decent enough time, but soon the other couples left and I had this feeling that things were about to get awkward. We were sitting at their dinner table when the guy and his wife started talking to us, trying to convert us. They brought out a Bible and started talking about what you have to do to be a Christian, the ultimate authority of their CoC interpretation of the Bible, etc. I really had a problem with how they believed that their interpretation was the only correct interpretation of the Bible and that all other denominations got it wrong and weren't Christians because they weren't following the Bible exactly. They also talked about how you can't question those beliefs since doing so would be to question God and therefore would make you not a Christian. I got really uncomfortable and finally all of my poking and prodding at my husband underneath the table got his attention that I wanted to go. So, we finally left. That was truly one of the most awkward moments of my life. We both felt strange afterwards and his friend kept sending him DVDs in the mail and inviting him to these gospel meetings, but we never went and we eventually lost contact.

This really made me upset about what we so often times do to non-believers (whoever they might be to us). We get to know them and befriend them in hopes of ""turning them to our side."" Or at least, that's what I've seen, especially in the college ministry I was a part of. It made me sick. I felt dirty and gross in those people's eyes and I'm sure there are lots of people who have felt the same way when interacting with people who are trying to ""save"" them. 

Anyone else have any experiences of having someone trying to convert you that you found shocking? (I'm not talking about Mormons coming to your door. I think everyone alive has been through that. I mean something rather unexpected.)

*Edit - I just have to say that I've really enjoyed reading all of the responses. I just recently got on to reddit, and r/Christianity really has been a great forum to be a part of. Great discussions. Very little trolling or spiteful people. A lot of encouragement and open minds. :) *",,False,,t5_2qh6c,1364263017.0,,chirho,True,t3_1azkx0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1azkx0/as_a_christian_has_another_christian_ever_tried/,

Tell me how you think I should live (details inside),01032012throwaway,312,118,775,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/15xjoz/im_gay_ive_accepted_christ_as_my_savior_tell_me/,"Edit 2: I should also mention that I'm still interested in reading people thoughts. I'm purposfully not commenting because this is a time for me in which I'm more interested in listening and hearing than repeating back the same things I'm said all my life. 

Edit 1: Update (01/04/12, 2:20 PM Central time)

I'd like to make a few clarifications and comments:

Clarifications:

(1) Some people thought this was either a troll or way to farm material for an article; it is not. I've sought this sub-Reddit's opinions from the heart.

(2) I've read every single comment in this post, and will continue to do so.

(3) I've upvoted replies with thought out and good intended advice; I haven't downvoted anyone, even the person who said I should be stoned to death, lol. Thanks for that.

(4) My spell-check isn't working, forgive any typos.

Comments:

(1) Thank you so much to everyone for responding to this post; I've gotten mounds of advice and reading material. It's extremely appreciated. I will definately check out the articles and books provided to me (With my main source bring the Bible).

(2) Some people are still stuck on my attraction to the same sex being a choice. That's your opinion but it's my opinion that you're wrong. If you're interested in getting to know the lgbtq crowd a bit in conversation, you might come to find this out. This is said to those of you in respect (That being said, keep reading for elaboration on this).

(3) Ex-gay therapy is just not something that I believe in, nor something I'll ever try. I'm not attracted to the opposite gender in a way that could harbor a emotional and physically kind of way. Yes the Lord can do ANYTHING, but this would be like me praying to not be a certain skin color. It's not going to suddenly change. I respect your opinions, but that's my opinion. 

**Conclusion:**

**Here's what I got out of this experience. I'm a person of Christ who happens to be attracted to men. This doesn't define me as a person. Focusing on this one aspect of me and not my relationship with God, the Spirit, and Christ is a sure way for me to not become closer to God.**

**I do not for a second believe that this one part of me is a choice, however, lust and out of marriage sex is not okay in the eyes of the Lord. There's no same-sex marriage option in the eyes of the Lord, no matter what it is in the political sphere. The action of homosexuality is considered a sin within the Word, so I must refrain from it. You can't continually live a life of sins and then just think it's forgiven because you ask for it. You have to truely repent with your heart. How can you truely repent for something that you meant to do? You just can't.** 

**What I need to do now is stop thinking about personal relationships and start developing a closer relationship to the Lord and His Word. I need to listen to Him and grow as a child of Christ. The fact that I'm gay is not pertinant to my relationship with God. I need to stop saying ""I'm a gay Christian."" It would be like saying, ""I'm a lusty Christian,"" or ""I'm a sexually out of wedlock Christian."" It's a moot point.**

**Celibacy seems like the only option, but I'll find out as time goes on with my relationship with God. But here's what I will do:**

**I'll study the Word of the Lord, talk to the Lord, listen to the Lord, live as the Lord asks, make mistakes in the eyes of the Lord, and ask for forgiveness from the Lord, recieve forgiveness if the Lord wills it. Every other aspect of my life comes with that.**

**I'm not going to constantly focus on ""you're gay, you're gay, you're gay,"" I'm going to focus on creating a stronger bond with the Lord and living a life that pleases Him with Him by my side, every step of the way.**

(Throwaway)

I am a gay person, a homosexual, it just is. It's not a choice. I've also accepted Christ as my one true savior years ago. 

I've heard plenty of versions of how I should live: some mention celibacy, others to live a ""normal"" existance but with a man, and a few that I shouldn't even be concerned with the sin.

It's ultimately a deeply personal choice of what I choose, but, I'm EXTREMELY interested in reading as many opinions of people on here as I can. I will read every reply. Simply look at my situation and tell me how you think I should live my life. I'm not looking to use other's words to chicken out of a personal decision nor will I use it as justification for anything.

It should be mentioned that I'm looking for a Christian opinion on this as well. As a member of thus sub-Reddit on another account, I do realize that other religious and even secular members post on here. I respect all of you but just want a Christian response in this thread. I'm not telling you what to do, just what I'm looking for in background.

Thanks!

&gt;Friends &amp; Family, 
   I apologize in advance because this may come as a shock to some of you as you may have not heard the bad news.  I just found out on Monday that I have stage 3 cervical cancer and they need to do invasive surgery to remove it; however, because of the risk to the baby (I'm 5 months pregnant) my doctor decided that it is better to wait until after the baby is born.  The oncologist wants to begin chemo and radiation immediately but this will result in a miscarriage of the fetus and I cannot bring myself to do that.  So basically, I can do nothing but trust in the Lord.  He tells us to turn to Him in times of trouble; nevertheless, this has been a scary place to be and I have been filled with so many emotions such as sadness, hopelessness, grief, anger, &amp; fear.  

&gt;Still, the Lord has given me an extra dose of His presence and I can feel him comforting me, carrying me, and holding me up when I do not have the strength to take another step.  Initially, I was going to keep this between my small group and family but I have decided that the more people I have praying for me the better.  Please pray that the cancer will reverse itself or remain stagnant until the baby is born (all things are possible through Christ and I will trust in Him).  God has been encouraging me through scripture and I pray that this will be an encouragement to you as well.

He is the regional director of Younglife in Arizona.

This last weekend, Mark was officiating the wedding of some mutual friends ours and had left Hazel (Their daughter) with her grandparents. A little before the ceremony started, he got a call that her grandparents had found her floating in their pool. About 2 hours after that, they were notified that she had passed away.

If the situation wasn't already bad, it gets worse. Mark and Erin wont be able to have another baby. I don't know all the details, but it was a miracle that they'd had Hazel, but after she was born it was clear another baby wasn't to follow.

I'm not asking for money or anything like that. I'm asking for two things:

1. Uplifting prayer. There will be anger between the family members, no doubt. Pray for their marriage and relationship with their parents.

2. A card. Something short or long, just something encouraging. They need it now more than ever.

Before that I was agnostic. I started going to church with my then boyfriend, and after about a year I gave my self to Christ. I realized he'd saved me, in a literal way. I was really sick my first and second years of high school, and I was suicidal. It wasn't that I wanted to die, I just didn't want to be sick anymore. I couldn't handle it. 

I set a date, I was going to take a ridiculous number of pills while my mom was out of town, because my dad would be less likely to check on me at night. That night my dad and I went to my grandparents house for dinner. I was distant, focused more on what I had planned that night. About halfway through dinner my grandma started crying.  She was a high school guidance councilor, and one of the students at her school, one that wasn't even one of her students, had tried to kill her self the night before. This so deeply effected by grandma, she was devastated, and she'd never even met this girl. There was no possible way she could have known, or done anything. 

I just remember thinking how could I hurt my grandma so much. How could I be so selfish. I decided to get help that night. I know in my heart, with every fiber of me that God chose to save me from my self that night. (The other girl was clearly just ""crying out for help"" as she'd only taken 8 Advil, and just ended up with a stomach ache) 

This changed my life. When I reflected on what happened is when I knew God had my back, and that I just needed to depend on him. I didn't need to do it alone. 

Because of my illness I developed an addiction to painkillers. After being in denial for several years about it, I finally gave it up to God. I prayed to him and asked for him to take it from me, to free me from the chains of addiction. He answered those prayers, and took it from me completely. No withdrawals, no symptoms... Just freedom. 

I am still struggling with the mental addictions. When things get stressful, I want a pill... But I have the strength in him. 

Sorry for the wall of text. This is a big thank you to The Lord for everything he's given me in my life. Lately I've become sort of complacent, and I needed to remind my self of everything owe him.

Im a seventeen year old youth leader in a family that has always been at the center of church life. To be honest. I dont know if i believe it anymore.

Is God good? Do i have more freedom without God? Why should i follow a God that will send billions of people to hell because he made them be born into a different faith? What evidence even is there for a God? To be honest im not sure that my experiences are even genuine anymore!

I'll be the thousandth person to say it, but what is going on here guys? Last time I checked we are to be the light and salt of the world. We are to be NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT. You shouldn't have to tell anyone that you are a Christian, but your actions to scream it out.

I just posted in a thread supported a brother in Christ we is seeking to have an intimate relationship with his Lord and Savior and people are telling him his little sins don't matter! We are supposed to strive for the perfection that was Jesus. We are runners in a race trying to reach an unobtainable goal, which Christ gives us through his redemptive blood on the cross. Stop conforming, stop telling yourself it is okay. Start living for Christ.

I can't be the only one who think this. Crap.

EDIT: I'm just going add this here to answer a few of the condescending Wonkas in this post. All of these posts claiming I must not like atheists, etc. What are you basing that on? My first line only says that this post is for Christians, like this subreddit is primarily for. It doesn't say they're stupid, that I hate any of them ( I strongly dislike a few, but I can't generalize a group like that.) I wanted to know if it was Christians that downvote legitimate Christian advice."" And if it was, what are they basing that on.

The post that broke the camel's back was a guy saying he was leaving reddit to get over a pornography addiction (lust, not necessarily masturbation as many have tried to turn the argument into, but even still, sexual immorality...come on now.) An atheist is the top post with 50+ more upvotes, making it the ""most helpful and relevant."" I don't care about karma, it means NOTHING. But is that really the most helpful and relevant advice a Christian gets when they seek it in /r/Christianity? All of you telling me I am excluding them, their advice can be helpful? You agree with that?

Lastly, none of you know me. In my circle of people I hang out with...probably 30-40% or close to it are atheist, Buddhist, etc. I don't exclude them from anything, I don't tell them I think they're failures, and they do the same to me. I respect their right to not believe and we move on in life. They know I am a Christian and they know I'd gladly talk to them about salvation at ANY point. Don't come in here telling me about judging people and excluding people. 

Please, tell me more about how open you are to atheism and their input in this subreddit. I would never think of kicking them out, but it does no good for them to respond to faith based issues. Theology, for sure. They can critique, deny, even debate it. That's helpful and keeps us from being close-minded.

I have been thinking a lot about this over the past few weeks, but [ChristGuard's recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/iasx2/why_rchristianity_is_should_really_be_called/) finally pushed me over into posting this.

So here's the deal.  I love Reddit, and I think it has a lot of value in its potential to identify and disseminate interesting, insightful, and amusing content.  However, regardless of what may be true in the broader cultures we live in, practicing Christians are a minority here on Reddit.

Regardless of your belief on whether or not Christianity as a whole is valuable for society, I hope that you will agree that people have been inspired by Christ's teachings to make positive contributions to our society, such as Martin Luther King and Ghandi (who was not a Christian, but WAS inspired by Christ's teachings).

However, especially in America, Christianity has been co-opted by people with political and corporate agendas and are manipulating and distorting Christian beliefs for hateful and selfish ends.  I know that many of you have been hurt by the effects of these beliefs.

I know that many of you think that we would all be better off if we gave up Christianity altogether.  Speaking for myself, I can tell you that is not going to happen.  What I have seen in Christ and his love is too beautiful, too incredible to trade for anything else in this world.

Some of you have asked us as Christians to fight the propagation of these false and harmful beliefs.  I am dedicated to doing so, but I need help--and thoughtful Christians who think critically are unfortunately a minority in many churches in America.  We need to be able to speak and communicate with one another wherever we can find each other.  Reddit could be a really valuable resource for reshaping the hostile and harmful Christian culture that exists today, but not as r/Christianity currently stands.

We need a place where we can discuss Christian ideas and beliefs from a Christian perspective without the need to formally prove God's existence in every thread.  Arguments from an atheistic perspective will have very little effect in persuading misguided Christians to change their harmful beliefs, but solid arguments from a biblical foundation might.  Furthermore, it would be nice if there were a place where lovers of Christ can freely discuss topics of interest to them from a Christian perspective, just like food lovers in r/food, fitness lovers in r/fitness, and weed lovers in r/trees.

And in general, I am sad that such a hostile culture has formed here.  r/Christianity seems like such a warzone when I read it.  I understand why it is natural that it would be a controversial place, but I think that a lot of the discussion is very unproductive.  I think we all would be better off if we didn't have to have theist vs. anti-theist debates in every thread.  I realize that some of you think that Christians should be able to defend their beliefs intellectually, and I agree, but surely you can understand if that's not what really what we want to do 24/7.  Most professional athletes, or gamers, or chess players are happy for a challenge, but sometimes they don't want a battle, they just want to eat a burger, or listen to Mozart, or discuss literature in a non-contentious environment.

So, Christians and non-Christians of r/Christianity, is it possible to allow r/Christianity to be a place where we can civilly discuss ideas and topics from a Christian perspective?  If so, how can we do it?  If not, why not?  Thoughts?

**Edit: Thanks guys, there were a lot of good thoughts and perspectives shared.  Mods, what is the possibility of disabling the downvote button here?  I think that would be valuable for promoting a plurality of ideas, rather than simply the majority opinion.  I also realize that it can be circumvented, but it would at least screen out the lazy trolls and the simply misguided?

I am falling from my faith. These are 15 of my issues I've been having. I hope you take time to read this and answer thoroughly so as to help me turn back to Jesus. I honestly do want to keep my relationship with him, but for 4 years it's been difficult because of all the reasoning and thinking I've been doing. Help? I don't want any answers like ""God works in mysterious ways."" We're human, and I don't expect you to have all the answers. If you don't know, don't give me an empty answer.


1. Why did God create Hell? At first, I told myself Satan created it, but then I realized God is the only one who can create from nothing. And regardless, he created Satan and he even knew before he rebelled that Lucifer would.
And yet, he couldn't short himself out one Angel to save trillions of his own creations, his own children, from an eternity in Hell, the eternal torture chamber he created specifically for the purpose of torturing his own children. I have two points to make about that. First, I can think of nobody, not a single person, who has done or COULD EVER do anything to deserve an eternity in such a place, especially not if they were my children and especially not if it was forever. My second point is he created us with the tendency towards evil, knowing what would happen to us. If I knew that if I have a kid they will go to a place like that even for a day, I wouldn't have a kid. Especially not trillions of them.
He created us for the single purpose of worshipping him; was our devoted, unconditional following of him SO important that he would commit us, his CHILDREN, to an eternity in Hell?

2. If it was always God's plan to provide Salvation through Jesus, why didn't he send Jesus from the beginning instead of setting up Judaism, when he knew it would prove inadequate?

3. What is the soul?

4. Why did God have to send Jesus? He's God. Couldn't he just forgive us? Sending his son to die seems dramatic considering he's God. He instead decided to kill his only son.

5. Why does God allow for hurt and sadness? And don't just say 'you can't know happiness without sadness,' because an All-knowing God should be able to find a way to experience happiness without sadness.

6. Why did God create evil?

7. When God wanted to destroy Sodom, he said he would. Then it was the angels who argued that there was good people. He finally agreed; Lot. When Lot was approached by the angry mob wanting to rape the angels who had disguised themselves as humans in his household, Lot said ""No, but you can have my virgin daughters."" This isn't acceptable in society today, but this was the action that presented him as righteous in God's eyes. Also, back during those times you could have slaves, give daughters in trade for goats, having sex with young girls, and a lot more that isn't acceptable today. How come, then, morals can't change now for things like gay marriage, but they could for things like slaves and pedophiles?

8. About Job, why did God purposely create Hell on Earth for Job, a loyal follower? He killed his innocent children, and also his wife, while causing him illness, material loss, and depression. Also: How could Satan stand in the presence of God when he is pure evil, if God couldn't even look at his own son when he had sin on him?

9. What did Jesus sacrifice? His life? No, he got that back 3 days later, and not just his life but also his full godhood. Was the manner of his death particularly awful? Well, many have suffered worse or caused worse deaths in his name. Did he not deserve it because he was sinless? That can't be it either because infants die who are sinless as well. So what did he REALLY sacrifice?

10. Is there free-will in Heaven? And if so, can we sin in Heaven? Why didn't he start out this way?

11. Why did all these other religions get started, or exist at all regardless of how long they've been around, back while miracles were still happening? (ex. Parting of the red sea, healings, etc.)

12. What historical/archeological evidence is there to prove that the events in the bible happened? (Ex. The flood, the Exodus, the lineage of Kings like David and Solomon, etc)

13. Are we supposed to get our morals strictly from the bible without influence from the world? What about on things like Slavery? Stoning of gays? Treatment of widows? Women's rights?

14. Why did Jesus die? As in, what penalty did he take? Hell? Death? Neither of those, so what did he save us from?

15. Why hasn't he come yet? (Matthew 16:28, Matthew 10:23, Luke21:32, etc)


These 15 things are just some of the many reasons I am struggling with the reality of it. Honestly, I am beginning to think I am an atheist. However, if I can salvage my faith, I believe a God who claims to be so loving and just would take me back.

Sincerely,

Up until recently, I identified as an atheist. This was, without a doubt, cause of my impending divorce. When I say it was the cause, I don't mean she didn't like that I was an atheist (although that was a factor); I mean it was because I wasn't living in God's light. Right now, we are separated and it has been hell for me. Prior to separation, I broke down and asked God for help. I found peace and comfort in church. I would go often and seek a relationship with God. My wife, at the time, knew that, but it was too late. 

It wasn't until recently that she has opened up to talking to me again. We only talk about the children, but this is a huge step from her not being able to make eye-contact. 

5 days ago, I asked her if I could do the 40 Day Love Dare [[Google](https://www.google.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;q=40+day+love+dare)]. She replied with ""sure, but don't expect anything from me."" Today, we had our first actual conversation in over 3 months. 


All I'm asking from you, fellow Christian, is a quick prayer. Anything that you can think of that would help in this long road to reparation. She is very strong in her faith, and she recognizes that it is not what I want nor what she wants, but it is God's will that will prevail.

Every animal, every plant, every single-celled organism, and all that is seen and unseen make up God's creation. Time itself exists and goes on by God's will. But that is not the most amazing part.

The most amazing part is that God, despite being the creator of all that is seen and unseen, despite being the king of all creation, still cares for each of us as individuals. For the least of us. This, brothers and sisters, is amazing. 

This is what I'm thinking about right now. How everything is God's collectively, yet everything is also God's individually.

Please keep him in your prayers. Thank you all, and God bless.

Edit: My dad is okay! He has surgery tomorrow for a heart catherization, but we are holding onto hope.
Although my dad is alive and well, I have to say, you all made me cry! Thank you all so much for the kind words and prayers. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it. I expected some responses, maybe 5-6, and some upvotes, but 64 comments and 181 upvotes?! That is outrageous, and I cannot tell you how much I appreciate this. I will pray that God blesses each and every one of you. Thank you. Seriously, thank you. You all helped more than you know.

EDIT 2: This actually isn't his first big rodeo(Sorry, Texan here, and the whole family has been down filling my ears with southern lingo), and he was horribly depressed before, when he first had a heart attack. I figured it was because of the heart attack, but was not sure. Thank you for this info though; I am glad to know it is partly physical, and not just him feeling terrible because of what happened (I'm sure that's it, in addition, of course). 

I certainly praise God more than I ever have before. I haven't been on my best Christian behavior lately (nothing terribly major, just not on my best behavior), so I have been ashamed to talk to God. I felt like he must be mad at me, and although I know he is a mercifull God, I felt like i didn't feel guilty enough for poor choices. But like I said, it was nothing major to ME. Premarital sex with my fiancee' of two years is also something God would not approve of, but it is probably better in most people's eyes than drinking in excess to avoid dealing with life.

But when I prayed for my dad, while seeing him, the strongest man I know, not being to make it from the front door to the car, and seeing my control-freak mother having to give the ambulance directions to our house (the GPS system always gives some bizarre route to another house), with fear in her eyes left me no choice but to finally face God. My parents are the strongest people I know. They both always say ""If we can fix it, no matter how hard it is, we will. Everything will eventually be okay."" But with my dad's death seeming to be impending, pardon my naivety, but it really made me realize ""well fuck...we can't fix this...""
No one is immune to death. I was finally made aware of my father's mortality a few days ago. I haven't always appreciated him as much as I could. He smokes a pack of cigarettes per day, and it enrages me, because I knew something like this would come up (not dissing cigarrette smokers, but we all know it is bad!). 

But enough rambling. Thank you all, so much, for praying. I cannot tell you how much it means to me. And I honestly feel like my father's recovery is partly due to you all caring and asking God to help. Thank you all so much.

My life has completely fallen apart in the past six weeks.  My family is about to be homeless.  My dad is going to court for a crime that will send him to prison for at least 5 years.  I have no money to pay my rent which is 3 months behind. 

God gave me my hands and my mind to conquer anything in my path.  I pray everyday for the strength to conquer my obstacles.  I do not sit idly by and let the universe push me around; I push back.  

I'm out of options at this point though.  I've done everything that I can think of to help my situation.  I've done my best to scrap together some money.  I got a small job that pays about $50 a week for odd jobs.  I have absolutely wonderful friends which I am so grateful for.  I love my family to death and would die for them. 

I've prayed so much.  I trust God.  I have seen so many small signs that that help is on the way.  I found out yesterday that two of my really good friends were Christian.  I did not know this and it was very comforting to know that I walked with Christian brothers.  

Despite everything though it gets closer and closer to brink of it all.  The absolute abyss of of failure and hopelessness.  I don't even feel like I'm at the ledge anymore but rather leaning over it.  

I just want God to tell me what to do.  Doubts are beginning to cloud my mind, I think I have suffered enough.  I don't know what more God wants.  I love him for everything that he is doing for me.  But I just need more help, one more miracle in my life.  

I don't know what to do. 

I've suffered from anxiety for the past 7 weeks.  Now I honestly feel like I may be sinking into depression.  I'm losing hope.  It's hard to keep faith when you're entire family is about to broke and homeless with my father in prison.  

*Things just happened so fast.  Everything in life went wrong in a week. And it's been snowballing ever since.  I just need more strength to continue.  It's very hard to move on anymore.  I'm feeling a stronger desire everyday to sleep more.*

(I am not suicidal). 

Update: I want to thank everyone so much for their offer of assistance. But I am just a student in college. The worst that can happen to me is that I sleep on couches and that I steal food from the cafeteria. My family life back home however is the real wreck, my dad is about to lose his home and there is nothing I can do about it. I can't stop worrying about them. Last week my dad turned off the water to the house to save money and is using our neighbor's well water. 

Plus I know how much trust is so important in this world. My life was ruined because someone broke my trust in them and they took away everything from me, financially and psychologically. 

I have enough food to last me a week and about $200 left on my credit card which is sustaining me at the moment until my bill is due. 

I just wish there was a way that I could accept help and somehow find a way to pay you guys back. I feel like the kindness of Reddit and this community has been abused so much. I want to remove doubt from everyone's mind that I could be such an abuser. 

I'm not sure what to do. Maybe God is giving me this message and I am simply meant to pay it forward. ",,False,,t5_2qh6c,1365550029.0,,,True,t3_1bz0v3,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1bz0v3/i_am_a_former_atheist_now_reconverted_back_to/,

I used to attend Sunday school and services almost weekly with my grandparents. But for reasons that are beyond me, once it was up to my brothers to to drive us to church, me and my brothers slowly showed up less and less until we stopped going. Because of this I lost my way and became less and less religious.


 Fast forward a little bit into me starting college. I have no shame admitting that I did my fair share of dangerous and stupid things that should have killed me because it is what put me here today. but because I was so naive I got pulled out of college for grades and just all around poor decisions. So I left college to return to my fathers house under his roof, I have been here for a year now. During this year my girlfriend of two years left me, I had several close friends pass away, and it all started to get to me and i wondered if I would ever have a happy life that could contribute something to this world. I began taking classes again at a local community college but my thinking continued to get darker and darker to the point i thought i would be doing everyone in my life a favor if i just killed myself so I wouldn't burden anyone anymore. And these past four days were very tough for me to get through.


 But last night I was looking though some old things and I came across my old bible and more specifically I came across a verse my church's pastor had highlighted for me and that verse was Matthew 6:34 ""take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof."" and as soon as I read it to myself I began to cry and this feeling of hope and love rushed through my body ,like a sudden feeling of warmth and safety, and there I was sitting on the floor crying, and smiling the most I have in years. It was truly a beautiful moment for me. I feel like a new man! I am happy with myself again! And this day I have decided to start reading the Bible again and soon start attending services.


 I apologize if my writing is off or confusing I just really had to share my story and what happened because it is the most beautiful thing that has ever happened to me.

However, this evening I was struck while sitting in my apartment with the gruesome and traumatic nature of his death. I found myself visualizing what that scene may have looked like, the blood, suffering and the total lack of human empathy on the part of those who tortured and ultimately murdered a radically transgressive Jewish rabbi who claimed to be nothing less than God himself. I thought about the nature of his sacrifice, and his embracing of the existential experience of what it means to be vulnerable and human. The idea that God would accept such a fate in order to compel us towards a better life of grace rather than the brutishness engendered by our violent evolutionary origins. It is a profound and endlessly compelling story, made all the more astonishing when placed in the context of not only what came before, but also the days following.

Then, about, ehh, four years ago, we got a new, young (20-somethingish) pastor who planted the seeds of change in our old and dying church. 
Then, I'd say about a year and a half ago, we got another new pastor after old-new one was told by our bishop to go to a different dying church in St. Louis. ( My church is in Columbia,a bout halfway between Kansas City and the Lou :) )
      My new-new pastor came and you know how the old pastor planted the seeds for change? The new one watered and sprouted those seeds into small saplings. She used the framework that Jill ( The first pastor) started and turned our church into:
First. Inviting all of the under privileged people in our neighborhood to the church, seeing as our church was in a neighborhood that was 95% below the poverty line. 
Secondly. Starting a Soup Kitchen the last sunday of every month, having a ""community meal"" where everyone in the community was invited to eat, free of charge.
After the second step, the old members of the church became disgruntled, and threatened to leave the church. We found out they weren't there to worship, but actually to just socialize with the other oldies.
Less than three months after the soup kitchen started, nearly all of the disgruntled older members of church left, leaving us with only about 50 members.
Then a miracle happened.
We started getting new members from our community. 
Poor, rich, old, young, housed, homeless. All sorts. 
Soon afterwards, we turned our once a month soup kitchen into a daily homeless shelter for the underprivileged.
We are now up to about a hundred members.

One of the hardest sin I have overcome is fornication. I am 22 and just out of college and while I have always been a christian since I was child, I had a serious problem with sleeping around while in college.

It was my first extended time away from family and friends, and like most at college, I got into the party and bar scene every weekend. It was not long before I saw the hookups start, and while I was a virgin, a hot girl and too much to drink lead me to having sex. I didn't feel guilt, or bad, but it opened the door to it happening more and more.

I prayed about it and asked God why I was having such a hard time with this sin. With thinking so little of this women that I would have sex with them without knowing the names and without ever seeing them after the next morning, some time not even 5 minutes after we were done.

The event that truly opened my eyes to this was a girl I hooked up with. To be more accurate, one I did not hook up with. After meeting a talking at a couple of parties, she came onto me at a bar one night. We end up leaving and going back to my place. Once there, and after a little making out, she got up and said, ""I know you are better than this."" and left.

I chased her to the hallway and called to her, but she just keep walking.

I didn't give it much thought as it was a few weeks to Christmas and break was coming up and not every situation works out. On break, I am at Christmas eve service with my parents and up comes one of my best female friends from youth group, she says ""hi"" and makes small talk and says, let me introduce you to my roommate from out of state. The girl gets up from the seat in front of us (she was facing away from us all the time) and who do you know it is, but the girl that left.

I am floored, I don't know if was setup or what, but I keep my cool and say hi and make small talk and leave.

Three weeks later back at school I get a letter in the mail (of all things) it is from the girl and she explains that my friend knows nothing about the night at the bar and her apartment, but that she put 2 and 2 together from talks with her roommate about her high school and church life and my talk with her at the party and the bar that night.

She felt that if I was faced with my sin in the way she handled it, I might see the error of my ways, and I did.

We never dated or anything but she is now one of my best friends. The Lord will always find a way to help lead us back to Him.

As I went through High School I was unfortunately that guy that thought he was the super Atheist and he could save all the people that I ignorantly deemed stupid for believing in God. But as I grew older in High School I started to question a bit about the few things in life I couldn't answer with my usual science approach. And when I got to college my very closest friend started to show me the better parts of religion. Where it can teach us about love and accepting each other for who we are and not living a cold hateful world that I used to. Also I hit a low point during the semester and all she could tell me is how much faith she had in me that I would get better. And the idea of faith was baffling to me. It was such a strong feeling that helped me so much in my hard times. Well now I'm done with the soliloquy, here are the questions. She gave me a Bible(NIV) for the summer to read and I have no idea where to start or how to approach the book in the least. So if you could give me some tips on where to start and ways to keep myself actually reading that would be lovely. Also if you could just give me some ideas and tips on how to possibly explore into a world of spirituality and where to learn more about it that would also be greatly appreciated. I have no idea where to start because I've never lived my life with this in it and I would like to give it a chance or at least get to know the thing that I spent so many years bashing in High School for no reason.

I had a sweet and peaceful nights sleep, and woke up with a smile on my face. I still tear up periodically, but they are not tears of grief or despair, but rather... well, I cannot explain it. Perhaps just facing the enormity of this thing called Death that we all face and have to deal with, and the enormous mystery of God's love for us and the salvation that he has wrought.

I believe that God has granted me the peace that you all have asked him to provide me. Gone is the crushing despair, the unbearable and excruciating pain.

Today is a good day.

I wanted to share an awesome thing God did through me today, but I want to avoid boasting if at all possible. I don't know if I'll tell anybody IRL, but it was a great experience, and I want to tell somebody. Thank you anonymity.

I went to Chipotle today for lunch. As I was walking in, a man stopped me and asked me if I could spare some change for him to get something to eat. I do my best to accommodate requests like this. Especially, since on the way to lunch I was praying to God and told Him that if he ever had a willing hand in the world, it was me. When this guy stopped me, I thought to myself, ""okay, here it is. that was quick""

The guy didn't appear homeless. If he hadn't said something, I would have walked right past. He just looked like someone minding his own business. But he stopped me, and I offered to buy him a burrito. I asked him what his story was. He said he'd come to town with some friends, but his car had broken down. He lives in a city about an hour away and his friends all got home through various family members, but he was stuck. Among other things, he was in town to see his son who has Autism Spectrum Disorder, but was totally out of money.

Anyway, as he was telling me that he was trying to scrounge some money together for a bus ticket, without a second thought I offered to buy him a ticket. I didn't feel like the words were mine. He was totally taken aback. After we got the food, he said he couldn't believe my generosity. I told him that I was just praying to be able to do something nice for somebody. 

He then quoted Romans 8:28 to me from memory: ""And we know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose."" He said that he'd just been praying for God to help him with this predicament. He was stranded and needed to get back home to get back to his job. I was flabbergasted.

I bought him a ticket on my phone for 8:30 tonight. He asked me if I would take him to get a razor so that he could get a clean shave before going to see his son. I said of course, and ended up buying him a razor and taking him back to my house to get washed up. I dropped him off at a friends' house not too far from where his son lives. He said he would get a ride to the bus station.

It's amazing what God does through us and for us, those who love Him. Open your heart to God and let him use you to accomplish His will. Money is non-moral, but hording your money with greed is a curse and parting with your money in the name of God is a gift!!! 

---------------
EDIT: This is a true story. I am not a troll. Somebody else re-posted to r/atheism under a different name and I guess also said some terribly racist things.

I'm sorry that some of you feel like cynicism is the best response to a witness to God working in the world. Could it have been a scam? I guess so. But there's a large homeless population where I live, and I'm familiar with the scams people run. And indeed I'm sure I've been scammed in the past, but not by this guy. Desperation leads us either to lie or to reach out to God who promises that He will take care of us. The fact that he quoted Romans 8:28 without skipping a beat was what floored me. I hung out with this guy for close to an hour. His name was Corey. We talked at length about his life, his son, and Autism Spectrum Disorder, the practical details of which he was very familiar (as am I somewhat).

Hebrews 6:10. God is not unjust; he will not forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have helped his people and continue to help them.

I have a job and I pay my bills like everyone else.

And like many other men, I struggled with sexual immorality for years. From pornography to masturbation, I seemed unable to break the habit and I thought there was no hope in overcoming this kind of sin. 

Honestly, it felt ""normal"". So many of my less spiritual friends would tell me that it's fine, that there's nothing wrong with me. However, I knew that not to be true. 
I knew deep down inside that the reason this whole issue had sprung up was because I was incredibly lonely. I had been used and abused by countless amounts of people after offering them my aid for so long; and after all was said and done I believed I deserved something.

That's when my sin would kick in. I would fantasize, letting my mind wonder, without even considering that what I was doing was dishonoring to God. It seemed fair, that I was allowed to sin because I had done more than what was expected of me. 
I knew, deep down inside, that it wasn't. I wanted to break the cycle, but I couldn't, and I knew that if this issue wasn't taken care of soon it would turn into something worse than it already was.


So, through desperation and in prayer, I've found a practical and effective method of dealing with these problems. For one, when I suddenly get that urge to fulfill a sexual sin, I will look for something to do around the house. Whether it is cleaning, making my meal for work or doing laundry doesn't matter, what matters is that it occupies my mind long enough to direct the energy of that urge somewhere else.
If I am in bed and I get a lustful desire, I pick up a book and read or listen to a Pimsleur lesson and attempt to learn to better speak a foreign language. I do this until I am truly tired and my body is ready to shut down for the night.
Once I'm at this stage I have no energy to waste on lustful pleasures and I quickly fall asleep.

I would recommend any and every guy who is dealing with a similar issue should do this. ",,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,swas,True,t3_16akda,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/16akda/dealing_with_sexual_immorality_and_some_advice_to/,

I want to point this out, because it speaks leagues of our character as a community. 

When browsing through r/Christianity, I see a community that is focused on strengthening one another's relationship with Christ and answering questions towards the validity and truth of the Bible.  There are very little ""attacks"" on differing views of the world.  Rather than being a community that downcasts others for thinking freely or different, you encourage them and help people see how we, as Christians, view the world (and back it Biblically).  Rather than being like r/atheism, and posting memes and FB posts of how ""dumb"" Christians are, we focus on building each other up. (YES, I understand r/atheism is an outlet for people to express their feelings because we live in a world were atheist is downcast and persecuted for thinking freely, and I believe a place like that is needed. My best friend is atheist and we have amazing conversations where we jar each others minds).  

Just as a whole, I wanted to say..
1. Thank you, r/Christianity for setting an example of what Christians should be
2. For backing the majority of your claims Biblically, for without this, we have nothing
3. The respect you have for atheist is astounding, just because someone thinks differently does not mean they are wrong.  (They are human and deserve just as much respect as your favorite theologian/pastor...and often challenge you to search for what you really believe)
4. Also to the ""civil"" atheists who frequent r/Christianity and speak your mind! (I for one thank you, if it was not for my best friend, I would be living a blind faith and not search for what I believe through scripture.)

There have been no signs of a crash as none of the emergency beacons have been activated. Due to corruption and incompetence of the air traffic control in Sao Tome we have not been able to find his last known location, but we believe it was in this area.
  Attempts to locate him via his iPhone have failed, but calling his phone was successful and the phone rang. This encourages us due to the fact that the line will not ring if the phone doesn't have signal (i.e. in the bottom of the ocean). We believe that Jerry may very well be alive and potentially being detained somewhere in West Africa. It is not unheard of for African druglords to force pilots into flying for them.

Please take a moment to pray for Jerry and his family. His wife is a very strong woman who is struggling with his disappearance as well as spearheading the search for him.

To me this seems to be the perfect example of how Christians should react to anyone we know involved in sin - including homosexuality.  Jesus steps in to advocate for her, he helps her, he does not judge her, he saves her, but he does say ""go and sin no more"".  

I think a lot of times the popular liberal approach of this community is to do the first parts of Jesus's reaction but leave out the end line.  Yes, Jesus was full of love and compassion - but he was put to death for a reason.  He was outspoken, strong, and unwavering!  We are to model that.  We are to be a peculiar people (1 Peter 2:9).  We are not supposed to be like the crowd.

I visit this site every day. At times, doing the work that I do and living under a bridge can be very difficult. I'll be honest and say I wanted to just escape and not live sacrificially anymore. However, in these past few days, I've felt a renewal of the call that first led me out here. 

I think I'll begin to post more often now.

1373696848.0,163,self.Christianity,1i7fro,How I got over the struggle I'm sure most men battle with... Pornography/Masturbation/Lust,m0pi1,198,35,122,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1i7fro/how_i_got_over_the_struggle_im_sure_most_men/,"I struggled with masturbation and lust a lot... It became such a feat I just wanted to give up and let it be the sin that will just hold me down until the day I die... Yet the conviction never stopped so there was always a truth I knew I haven't faced yet. A truth telling me that it WAS possible. Okay so it was possible... But my viewpoint was that it was wayy too hard for ME to overcome. Maybe some men are just built with a stronger will than me because this isn't something I am capable of overcoming (I was just living in defeat constantly..)

I could go for a few days with sexual purity but I always found a way to let myself fail.... That was until I found the source of where I had it wrong. My heart. 


 ""Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it."" (Proverbs 4:23)

A pure heart will give you clean hands. So.. once I let this truth sink deep within me, my very next request from God was to give me a pure heart.

""Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me."" (Psalm 51:10)

You need to pray for this and then believe God WILL do it. Do it now. Then continue reading...


The trick here on out is not giving yourself any opportunity to possibly fail... Don't trick yourself into going deeper down the rabbit hole once the temptation starts. I think we all know how we end up in situations where we don't want to be in... Its by little yeses. A little yes here and a little yes there will lead you in a place where you will eventually regret. Remember, the matter is in your heart and thats where it will always start.

Do you really want to have this sexual thought? NO. Do you really want to look at her that way? NO. Do you really want to go to that website that may or may not tempt you more? HELL NO.

""Submit yourselves, then, to God. Resist the devil, and he will **flee** from **you**."" (James 4:7)

End the battle before it even begins. I am now months into living a sexually pure life and it truly hasn't been much of a struggle at all... I am aware of guarding my heart though and making sure it is in accordance to Gods will by talking to Him and reading the Word. Its pretty easy now...

""Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.” (Matthew 11:28-30)

I did not mean to pick on non-denoms or evangelicals in particular. This specific non-denominational experience is just what led me to vent my frustrations. We should all learn the lesson, wherever we worship.

Edit #2: Yeesh this post rubbed some people the wrong way. This is about my *one* experience at *one* church. It's totally subjective. I've got nothing against people who worship Christ in any way. But I still think I make some good points. You decide.

Edit #3: No post goes unpunished. I am not espousing Anglicanism. I am a Christian Anarchist who has gotten a whole lot from orthodox doctrine and the sacraments via the Anglican tradition in my upbringing. I'm not saying one denomination is better than another. I'm just articulating what I think some serious weaknesses are with respect to what I saw and what the Apostles taught. I'm not trying to convert you, I just want you to think critically about your own situation.

Disclaimer: This is a very very long post. But it serves a purpose. If you don’t want to read it all, skip to my conclusions at the bottom. But I encourage everybody, especially you non-denoms or evangelicals to read it in full.

So I went to a non-denominational mega church for Sunday worship this morning. It was quite an experience, and I feel called to share my thoughts and impressions. This is not a sleight directed toward *people* who go to non-denominational churches or mega churches. But I’ve realized that much in the same way that orthodox liturgy has been the primary worship experience in my life, many people find God for the first time and continue to worship Him in places like this. I feel that it is important as members of the same body (of Christ) to be able to communicate across denominational barriers so that we might build each other up. Much of what I am going to say could be taken as criticism, and perhaps should be, but I welcome any comments and defenses.

We parked and walked up onto quite a scene. It was a complex of large buildings connected by an open courtyard with very broad sidewalks and very expensive landscaping. There was a food trailer (very Austin…), a lot of fancy cars parked in various places left over from a car show?? that happened last week, and hundreds of people as far as the eye could see. I would not have known which building the service was in without the signs because they were all crawling with people. There was a café that served coffee, refreshments, and had a full service kitchen. There was a building for “Kid’s Quest”. And then of course there was the sanctuary - excuse me - ‘auditorium’. I don’t remember seeing a single cross anywhere, and I couldn’t help but be reminded of Jesus turning over the moneychangers’ tables in the Temple (Matthew 21).

We walked into the auditorium a few minutes before the service started and there was techno blasting out of the P.A., a very discotheque blue lighting theme, and a projector that was displaying a countdown over what was essentially a viral video montage of people doing action sports. We sat down into plush movie theater seats complete with cup holders, which many people were using for their drinks and snacks. After the countdown ended, the lights changed and directed our attention to the worship band who proceeded to do a very impressive 10 minute Zepplin medley… This was apparently a special treat for all the dads for Father’s Day. Don’t get me wrong. I loooove Zepplin and they played very well. I gig in a hard rock band around Austin regularly. But at church on Sunday?... It was an instrumental and the lyrics were very conveniently omitted.

The pastor came out onto the stage and there was a series of gift card giveaways to the dad that had the youngest child, the most daughters, and the grandfather with the largest number of grandkids. After that was done, the band led the congregation in 2 Christian rock songs. Which was fine. Not really my scene. But the songs were definitely God-centered, and I can appreciate that. I didn’t know the music, and even though the words were projected onto the screens, I didn’t feel called to sing. Neither did most people. We were at a concert…

After the music, the pastor got started. This was the second week of a series of sermons adapted from the Parable of the Sower [Matthew 13](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13&amp;version=NIV). This week was about the 2nd soil that Jesus describes, the rocky soil in which the seed sprouts quickly but does not take root. I thought it was a great start. There’s so much to talk about what it means to find faith with joy and strive to keep it. How to nurture it and let it take root. But instead, the sermon loosely focused around the theme word for the week - ‘tenacity’ - which I guess is what he took from that part of the parable. They played some clips from the movie Hot Rod that showed Andy Samberg failing every jump that he makes in the movie miserably. The pastor then went on for about 40 minutes talking about himself. Taking his kids to the park, his relationship with his wife, his relationship with his dad. To my memory, he never once referred back to the scripture verse or really engaged it directly at all. He did pull up a few verses that supported various parts of his ambiguous message. Fathers don’t be too harsh on your kids (Ephesians 6:4). Husbands love your wives (Ephesians 5:2). And then during the closing song, people started leaving to beat the traffic.

I left feeling very unchallenged and fairly concerned that this is what thousands, even millions of people do every week to ‘worship’ God. I had essentially seen a motivational speaker with a live backing band. To invoke Jon Stewart, it was **NERF CHRISTIANITY**. With all of the consumer culture and childish entertainment baggage that the idea carries with it. 

---------

Conclusions and Concerns:

1. This is so so so far removed from what the Apostles instituted as Christian worship. Church is not supposed to be for your entertainment. It’s supposed to be for your spiritual benefit. It's supposed to be a place where you can remove yourself from the world and focus on your relationship with God directly, even if only for an hour on Sunday. Instead, here, they have embraced the world and invited it into their midst. Led Zepplin, Andy Samberg, movie theater seats, cup holders. Give me a freaking break. **You’re not supposed to observe, you’re supposed to participate. You’re not supposed to be entertained, you’re supposed to be admonished**

2. Church is supposed to be where followers of Christ are fed with the Word of God. Not given a glimpse into the life of the pastor and expected to take some vague principle or lesson from it to apply in their own life. The Bible is full of lessons from the Old Testament, from Christ Himself, and from the Apostles. Let’s talk about those people’s lives. In the early centuries, the church organized what is called a **lectionary**, which provides a way to cycle through the scriptures without skipping anything you don’t want to talk about. This was a practice inherited from Judaism. Every day, there are pre-ordered readings from the Old Testament, the Gospel, and the Epistles. They often relate to each other extremely well. These verses are all read aloud in full. The pastor/priest is provided with rich source material on which to expound. His words are supposed to clarify and directly elaborate on the lesson (in full) in the scripture. **Not the other way around. He’s not supposed to articulate some vague story and use single out-of-context verses to validate his otherwise vacuous message**.

3. **THE EUCHARIST!!!**. Eucharist (and sometimes baptisms which were also accompanied with Eucharist) were the only reason members of the early church were ever all together in one place. I’m not going to go into real presence theology. If you don’t believe that Christ meant Eucharist (and baptism!) as more than a metaphorical exercise, I humbly suggest you do look closer and do some research. But regardless, if you don’t do Eucharist at your church, or you don’t do it very often. I suggest you ask your pastor why. And listen to his answer very carefully.

**TL;DR... If you’ve found Christ in a place like this, that is wonderful and I am so happy for you. But there is SO MUCH MORE. If your church sounds like the spectacle that I describe above. Do yourself a favor and branch out. Just try it. Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Methodist, Baptist, even a smaller non-denom church, whatever. Just try something else. You’re being done a serious disservice and you don’t even realize it.**

**Matthew 7:15. ""Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.”**

Ever since the addition of /r/atheism as a default subreddit, attention to /r/Christianity has spiked.  Whereas earlier this month we had a couple days with only one or two thousand impressions and a couple hundred unique views, this past Sunday we had a whopping 60,000 impressions and 11,000 unique views.  While this influx has resulted in some stellar discussion, we have noticed that it has exacerbated a recent drop in the quality of our frontpage.  Before I continue, and so that I am not misunderstood, **I am not saying that atheists have derailed our frontpage.**  Rather, the trajectory of our discussions, the main thrust of the ongoing conversation, has been dominated by topics outside of the aims of this subreddit, and some of that is likely the result of /r/atheism being added as a default sub.

[Of the top 20 posts this past month](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/top/), we have a handful of ""to the atheists"" or ""from the atheists"" posts.  More than half are imgur links.  There are a few memes.  There are several crossposts.  Interesting self-posts and thought-provoking articles are few and far between.  I'm anticipating a backlash here from the many of you who participated in the comments section, so let me backpedal a bit and affirm once again that yes, some interesting conversation did occur.  The point that I am trying to make (on behalf of the moderators) is threefold: 

1. While the types of posts (x-posts, atheicentric posts, imgur links) that received the lion's share of attention are permitted, they should be posted sparingly; 
2. Quality new submissions are being downvoted before they're noticed on the frontpage (we've been keeping track); 
3. Discussions have focused heavily on Christian/atheist rivalry, with newcomers missing the point (rampant in the [JesusWeen thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/li0dw/this_kinda_crap_makes_me_facepalmxpost_from_pics/)) as a result, escalating debate.
_____
**We want to use this post to reiterate a few groundrules for this subreddit in hopes of returning to intelligent discourse:**

- The point of this subreddit is **all things Jesus**.  Yes, this will necessarily dovetail at times with issues relating to religion at large (or even irreligion) - but those things should not be the main thrust of discussion.
- Submit and upvote relevant posts.  **Visit our [what's new](http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/new/) tab frequently and upvote interesting content.**  Anything that could spark a good discussion deserves to be upvoted.
- Bearing the former in mind, rage comics, imgur links, and X-posts **should be posted sparingly**.  Similarly, posts in the vein of ""to all the Christians"" or ""to all the atheists"" or ""from a friendly atheist"" are discouraged except for on rare occasions.
- **Use your upvotes and downvotes** in accordance [with Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette).  Downvote a post or a comment if it does not contribute to **relevant** discussion (as outlined above).  Upvote a post or a comment that does.  **Do not upvote or downvote simply because you disagree with someone.**
- Gently point frequent questions (including those in the vein of, ""Christians, I just don't understand X"") **to [our Frequently Asked Questions](http://www.reddit.com/help/faqs/christianity)**.  And remember [/r/DebateReligion](www.reddit.com/r/debatereligion) is where debate is supposed to occur.
- **Report violations and spam**.  [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23Christianity) or click ""report.""  We have a [Community Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianityPolicy/comments/cixs8/community_policy_for_rchristianity/) that spells out much more specifically what our expectations are.
_____
I apologize for the overuse of bold text for emphasis, but this final point is the thread that ties the above together.  **Our subreddit exists primarily for Christians to discuss the Christian faith.**  Or, to borrow verbiage [from a popular recent post on /r/atheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/llaxn/this_is_our_house/), **this is our house**.  Discussions that pertain, broadly or narrowly, to Christianity to some lesser degree are a *distant second*.  And lest we get lambasted for this brash display of religious chauvinism, I want to remind you that the same applies to /r/atheism.  [This eminently reasonable post from /r/atheism](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/lml70/an_important_note_on_what_is_and_is_not/) could easily have been written by us, with the roles reversed.  And in fact, with the explosion of atheist discussion on Reddit of late, the same [has](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/loe67/hi_people_who_are_new_to_ratheism_please_read_the/) [been](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/lp1kw/heres_why_ratheism_has_seen_such_a_backlash_from/) [said](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/lpdbj/this_is_ratheism_this_is_why_i_come_here/) [over](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/lp7sm/another_reason_why_ratheism_has_the_right_to_say/) [and](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/lkg0f/to_all_the_religious_newcomers_to_ratheism/) [over](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/lp74e/im_kinda_getting_tired_of_this/).

1 Peter 5:8-11 NIV


Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings. And the God of all grace, who called you to his eternal glory in Christ, after you have suffered a little while, will himself restore you and make you strong, firm and steadfast. To him be the power for ever and ever. Amen.


Philippians 4:8-9 NIV


Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. Whatever you have learned or received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you.


Hebrews 12:1-2 NIV


Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, let us throw off everything that hinders and the sin that so easily entangles. And let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us, fixing our eyes on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of faith. For the joy set before him he endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.


1 Peter 4:1-3 NIV


Therefore, since Christ suffered in his body, arm yourselves also with the same attitude, because whoever suffers in the body is done with sin. As a result, they do not live the rest of their earthly lives for evil human desires, but rather for the will of God. For you have spent enough time in the past doing what pagans choose to do—living in debauchery, lust, drunkenness, orgies, carousing and detestable idolatry.


Philippians 4:13 NIV


I can do all this through him who gives me strength.


Romans 12:1-2 NIV


Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God’s mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship. Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is—his good, pleasing and perfect will.


Psalm 119:11


I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.


James 4:7


Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.

No temptation has overtaken you except what is common to mankind. And God is faithful; he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can endure it.


Ephesians 6:11


Put on the full armor of God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes.


James 1:12


Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial because, having stood the test, that person will receive the crown of life that the Lord has promised to those who love him.


Zechariah 4:6


So he said to me, “This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel: ‘Not by might nor by power, but by my Spirit,’ says the Lord Almighty.

Here's one I heard lately from an old friend.


  &gt;There was a barber that thought that he should share his faith with his customers more than he had been doing lately. So the next morning when the sun came up and the barber got up out of bed he said, ""Today I am going to witness to the first man that walks through my door."" 
       
&gt;Soon after he opened his shop the first man came in and said, ""I want a shave!"" The barber said, ""Sure, just sit in the seat and I'll be with you in a moment."" The barber went in the back and prayed a quick desperate prayer saying, ""God, the first customer came in and I'm going to witness to him. So give me the wisdom to know just the right thing to say to him. Amen.""

But after I gave it more thought, I realized that this would be darn near impossible and probably quite inappropriate for one simple reason:

**People’s faith (or lack thereof) informs their political beliefs in different ways and to different degrees.  This is a very real issue within the Christian community and warrants discussion.**

So let’s have those discussions.  But let’s do so with proper decorum and kind regard for our fellow brothers and sisters.  With this in mind, I suggest the following:

1.	Whereas many people hate the idea of Republican Jesus, I think many of us can agree that the idea of Democratic Jesus is equally absurd.  Regardless of their stances and merits, neither party has a monopoly on Christian values, and no political party has died for our sins.

2.	If you want to discuss politics, I highly recommend citing sources: Bible passages, journal articles, polls, and statistics.  This keeps the discussion on the issues and not on which participant is the best Christian.

3. Please don't generalize folks.  It's generally counter-productive to fruitful discussion.

4. One final note:  please respect reddiquette.  I realize that everyone will have different ideas about what contributes to discussion and what doesn’t, but please don’t simply downvote because you think someone is wrong.  If enough folks of a certain viewpoint do this, it devolves discussion into an echo chamber.

I think I felt God...,mmolls,251,90,269,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/owzwv/exatheist_i_think_i_felt_god/,"Long story short: Strong atheist for about 17 years (**Edit:** many don't like the wording - I simply meant from birth to the 17 I identified as atheist). Started questioning after some tough family times. Suppose I sort of became agnostic for a while? I became sure there was ""something else"".

At university I met a Christian (**Edit:** again for people confused - this was NOT immediately when I started questioning, hence ""agnostic for a while"") who invited me to church despite not knowing I was considering God and questioning my beliefs. I definitely felt something at church. I got very freaked out but the only way I can describe it was that I felt over-whelmingly calm and it was like a sort of 'fullness'.

This was slightly over two years ago. I know that I definitely now believe in a God of some sort. What would your advice be? I have tried to forget about it all but I seem not to be able to forget how I felt. I'm not sure if what I heard at church is the same God I sort of acknowledge... I have no-one to talk to about this - the Christian friend I made is now no longer a friend (long, complicated story).

Any advice would be appreciated as I can't shake this feeling I had and I want to know if it was God... and if He won't let me forget it because he wants me to become a Christian/explore the bible at least... It bothers me a great deal. The main reason I'm so confused is because I really didn't like what I was being told at church yet at the same time I was feeling something so strong that it unsettled me. I'm 22 now so I've been struggling with this for years.

**Edit:** Off to bed now - nearly 5am in the UK. Thanks to everyone for being so nice! You've given me some great advice and a lot to think about. 

**Edit:** Added some clarifications for the people who think I've made it all up because I ""probably wasn't a strong atheist when I was a child"". Just grouped it together for ease. Also, thanks again to everyone who has been supportive and so nice. I will definitely explore some of the things that have been suggested before making up my mind about anything. A lot of research to be doing. I'm at a loss as to why some people would think I made this up to get attention - why would anyone specifically want lots of people to tell to them to read the bible? I guess that's the only way some people can conceive that an atheist would consider religion.

Well, I think it worked out for the better for me, and us, as a whole.


I spent Easter Sunday with him, and we went to this huge event that his church had with about 6-7000 people there. It was basically a massive service with an amazing concert at a stadium.


For the first time in years, I actually recognized and sang along with the gospel. It was actually very moving for me. Being the researcher I am, I read a lot of texts from here, the bible, and from the suggestions of other posters.


Yesterday, I went to church with him again, a regular sermon, and it was so coincidental that the sermon was very much relate-able to the problems we were having in our relationship. Maybe it was God's plan? It was about how relationships, marriages are a huge deal and how we need to find the right person with the right values, the same values as us. How there will always be the high of highs and the lowest of lows.


After the sermon, we held hands and didn't say anything on the walk to the car. When we got in the car, he said, ""thank you for coming with me, it means a lot to me"" and I said of course, I am happy to be here. And I truly was.


Now, I'm not going to say I'm a Christian now. But I honestly do believe it's a good start for me. I feel weightless when I'm at church with him. I think being with a Christian man has brought out the best in me so far comparatively to other relationships of my past.


As for our differences on social issues... we talked about it once, stated our opinions and that was it. No argument, it was just a simple chat really.


We are both enjoying this new chapter in our lives, and I'm enjoying learning right now. Thank you r/Christianity for all the advice before


**EDIT: Wow, I just read through all the comments. I know it seems pretty lame when I say thank you since it's so short, but I really do mean it when I reply to the comments with it. I did not expect this post to get a lot of attention but the support really does mean a lot to me. So again, thank you!

Please Help,tronkoop,216,61,213,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1128iu/wife_cheated_please_help/,"My wife and I met two years ago and got engaged last November.  We have always had a very loving relationship but at times it felt as though we were either madly in love or arguing. Most arguments always ended in laughter and laughter has always been a big part of our relationship. She has many insecurities and co-dependency issues but I always knew we could work on them through counseling and church which we have done some of.

6 months into dating we took a break for 5 days.  During that time she slept with two men and made out with one.  The one she kissed had always had a crush on her and I was always very wary of him but she assured me it was ok.  It took her 8 months and an extremely emotional conversation after we got back together to admit that she had done this.

1 month before the wedding I had a softball tournament on a weekend.  A few days before the tournament she got a late invitation to an out of town wedding of a mere acquaintance.  She begged me to go but I told her I had made a commitment but that she should go and have fun.  She became very upset and even threatened to call off the marriage.  I believed it was just one of her fits and that weekend we went to our separate events.  After the wedding she went to her sisters and made out with a man that had also admittedly had a crush on her whom I did not trust.  She told me immediately but backed it up with the fact that she believed the wedding was off, which to this today I remain skeptical.

We were married July 6th of this year and 6 weeks later I fell asleep on the couch one night before she came home from work.  I woke up at 2 A.M. to find out she left a voicemail saying she ran into an old friend in town and they were going out for drinks ( high school boyfriend).  They stumbled in at 3 A.M. and she did not even bother to come upstairs to kiss me.  I found them lying on the couch, fully clothed, with heads at opposite ends passed out.  I was enraged and left the apartment and did not speak to her the entire next day. The following night she called and we talked it over but then she broke down, started bawling and admitted that the day I didn't talk to her, that night she went out with some friends and slept with a friends boyfriends friend.  She was really drunk and said she stopped it but my world crashed that day.  I kept asking why why why and hung up saying I never wanted to see her again.  

I contacted her 2 days later and the following day I went back to our apartment.  We talked it over and I said we will work at it but things needed a drastic change.  While making dinner I asked if that was all that happened and again more tears and hysteria.  She said that the night I told her I never wanted to see her again, she again went to the bars, got drunk, and made out with a client of hers she saw there.  I again left feeling even more broken.

For a few weeks after that I continued a pattern of going back, things would be good for a couple days, and then she would resort back to not doing the things she said she would try to do to save the marriage and it reflected in her personality.  I finally left for good one day and said we need to get a divorce.  I found out a few days later that again she had slept with the same guy she made out with before our wedding. Crushed even more.  

For the past few weeks I have been getting my side of the divorce papers signed, moving my stuff out, getting bills out of my name and into hers, and just the general nonsense that goes along with this situation.  Finally after weeks of trying she agreed for a time to sign her half but wouldn't have them notarized that day because she was too busy.  The next day she called crying and told me we need to talk and that she had some things she had to tell me.  I went to our apartment and waited for her to get off work.  I went on the computer and clicked on the facebook tab.  It opened up to her page (promise I wasn't snooping, I dont even know her password).  Open on the page was a chat session with a different client of hers (7 years older, 2 kids, and currently going through his own divorce for cheating on his wife).  They had apparently been talking for the couple weeks after I left.  Discussions about how excited they were to see each other on different nights, discussing plans about a trip they are on right now, and just horrible things.  He had been sleeping in my bed, at my apartment, with my wife, on the mattress and beautiful bed set my mother bought us for our wedding, and now that disgusting mattress is sitting in my basement and I cant wait to throw it away.  This one hurt the most, because I couldn't figure out how she could love me so much but do such horrible things and not feel the pain that I felt.

Her parents have disowned her and have kept in contact with me making sure I am ok and explained that they always knew of her problems and that they needed to be dealt with but never thought they could manifest to this.  I have since been trying to get her to notarize her side but she keeps canceling appointments last second with the lawyers when I am sitting there (3 times, extremely embarrassing), avoiding e-mails, texts, phone calls, and I just cant get her to take 5 minutes to sign these documents.

I still some days love and miss her but I don't know how to ever forgive her.  Is there a reason these papers aren't signed?  Is this a sign?  I never wanted divorce and now I keep reading about how God can get me through anything, US through anything.  We are so close to finalizing but now I am having cold feet about pulling the trigger, even though she seems to be somewhat dating someone.  So confused and desperately in need of some advice as I cant function at work or in my social life with this hanging over my head, those thoughts running through my head.  All my friends and family (and her family), many of them strong Christians, have said she is sick and I need to move on.  I just am bewildered that I am still having doubts after everything she has put me through, and I think that being right with God or wondering what His plan actually is for me is the only thing making me second guess before she comes back from her trip this weekend.  I know Jesus allows for divorce in this type of scenario but I also know He still hates it no matter what.

Edit:  Well I feel rather embarrassed now after reading all the comments posted.  I am seeing a therapist and the only reason I posted this here is because people who are unemotionally attached generally are able to have the clearest point of view.  Sure there were red flags before the wedding but I also knew the person she could be.  Still stupid I know but I really do love her.  I often have 3 or 4 days in which I feel strong and excited to move on and feel its a blessing and then days like yesterday where I get depressed and I don't want to believe this is happening.  I'll move forward with the divorce and in promising to someday forgive her, and I cant thank you all (most of you) for your considerate thoughts and prayers.

I have had experiences in my past before in which I have felt God's presence, but I looked past it because that is just what I thought I should do. Even an outer body experience when I was 5 and I almost drowned still did not convince me of anything. Then, when I met my gf, everything changed. I really believe God intended to bring us together, and I could tell you a long list of reasons why (I will shorten it by saying we really help each other out in serious issues with our past), but overall, I am here to get help on another level: Fully accepting God into my life. 

Now, as a former atheist, everything has had to be fact based, empirically validated falsifiable evidence. Believing in something without any evidence has always felt stupid to me, and to be honest, it still kind of does. I just can't get passed me former feelings on the matter. I feel that God does exist, because I have felt him in my life before, but I just don't feel him now. I am waiting for something big to happen, and am trying to be patient but it is getting tiring at times. 

How can I accept God into my life more? I have prayed for this to happen, for him to let me understand him more. I think overall, since this is so important for my gf that I do this (but isn't forcing me), I am more wanting the want for this to happen, rather than simply wanting it. As an example, it is like most people saying they want to lose weight, but do nothing about it. They want to WANT to lose weight. THat is how I am with God. 

That is the first step for me is to sincerely WANT it, but how, do I do this seemingly large emotional undertaking? Is there perhaps any suggestions the hivemind here has, or even some literature?

I understand that it makes for a friendlier, more appealing forum, but are we not sometimes compromising some basic tenets of Christianity in the interest of tolerance?

I am specifically referring to many points I read about how you can find God in your own way, and not insisting that we believe atheists are going to hell. The Bible clearly states that no one can reach God unless it's through Jesus. This means that only people who believe that Jesus died for their sins will enter heaven, and even among those who claim to believe in Him, only a few will actually enter. (Matthew 7:22)

There's no roundabout way or alternative. It's either salvation through what the Bible says or...you're not really a ""Christian."" 

Am I too harsh? Am I interpreting the Bible in my own, provincial way? I am not on a holier-than-thou crusade here -- I have a big heart for atheists just like many on this subreddit do, but I feel like it's wrong to modify the message into something friendlier for the sake of tolerance (see Joel Osteen).

[edit] Thank you for all of your responses, I've learned so much. I never knew that I subscribed to something called ""Sola Scriptura,"" I've always assumed that nearly all Christian denominations believed in it (I told you I was sheltered...although I did go to a Catholic high school)

Also, all of the Scripture-quoting during the debates on gay marriage certainly didn't help me realize that Christians didn't all view the Bible as the final authority. But I do see now that heterosexual marriage is also rooted in tradition, and how even people who don't believe in Sola Scriptura could be against it.

&gt;""But a man is not really convinced of a philosophic theory when he finds that something proves it. He is only really convinced when he finds that everything proves it. And the more converging reasons he finds pointing to this conviction, the more bewildered he is if asked suddenly to sum them up. Thus, if one asked an ordinary intelligent man, on the spur of the moment, 'Why do you prefer civilization to savagery?' he would look wildly round at object after object, and would only be able to answer vaguely, 'Why, there is that bookcase... and the coals in the coal-scuttle... and pianos... and policemen.' The whole case for civilization is that the case for it is complex. It has done so many things. But that very multiplicity of proof which ought to make reply overwhelming makes reply impossible."" ~ *Orthodoxy*, ""The Paradoxes of Christianity."" 

The comment is this. Many times people ask on this forum questions like, ""What are your reasons for believing in God?"" ""How do you know God is real?"" And so forth and so on. But the problem, at least for me, with answering the question at all is that, because I am fully convinced of my faith, *everything* is evidence for God's existence. You ask me, ""How do you know God is real?"" and my (almost) stuttering response is, ""Because we're breathing, because we're having this conversation, because the sun is shining, or because it's raining, because anything beautiful exists at all, and not only beauty but wrong and sin as well--for where would I have the idea that the world isn't right if I didn't have some idea of how it was supposed to be right?"" You ask me for a miracle, and I say, ""Every waking moment is a miracle."" And so whether God speaks to me in an audible voice, or heals me from my diseases, or gives me the grace of another living moment on this earth, I am equally grateful for what He does moment-by-moment. 

Faith, yes, is belief in certain things. But it is also a profound perspective that the believer has from inside his/her faith. Lewis's words are highly appropriate again, ""I believe in Christianity as I believe that the sun has risen: not only because I see it, but because by it I see everything else.""",,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,,True,t3_s8d2c,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/s8d2c/a_chesterton_quote_and_why_sometimes_we_have_a/,

Having been baptized according to my own will, I take Christianity quite seriously but this is one hurdle I feel like I cannot overcome. I have posted on this site before regarding this issue and I am thankful for all of your prayers but yet... i have failed again and again and again. I felt hopeless and trapped. Everytime I was tempted, I gave in and afterwards I prayed for forgiveness. This never ending pattern is slowly destroying me. I lost all motivation to work, to study, to do anything BUT being productive. I hate myself right now.
Deep in my heart, I know God created me to be more than this, to be stronger than this. I want to be changed, I want a brand new start. 
So tonight, I gave in to temptation once again. Feeling depressed and utterly worthless, I was browsing through Itunes and I stumbled upon the song, ""In Christ Alone"" by Kristian Stanfill. The song struck me and tears began to flow down my face. As I was crying, a voice in my head said, ""Come home my son, I have missed you dearly. I will not blame you for what you have done because my love surpasses all of your sins."" After hearing this, I was instantly reminded of the Prodigal Son Parable. I realized that God loves me, he loves us. Even though our sins hurts him deeply, but yet the kingdom celebrates because God found another lost son, whom he truly loves.
Dear brothers and sisters, I ask you to please pray for me. Pray that I will have the courage to standup to temptation and overcome my addictions. I know that on my own will, I will fail miserably but with God and your prayers, I can do this. I posted this to remind you all that maybe today you are like me, feeling depressed and worthless. But know that you have a heavenly father, who loves you dearly and will do anything to rescue you from your misery. His love can conquer all.

As a 15 year old non-religious young man, when I first came to reddit (which was not that long ago) it was obviously r/atheism that attracted my initial attention. I'll admit that at first I found most of the posts quite amusing; I'm sure many people - regardless of religion - will agree there many ignorant people out there (both religious and non-religious). However, it soon became apparent to me that many atheists are just as bigoted as those whose arguments they are attacking: I've seen countless people attack religious persons for the morals they live by - some morals of which are taught by their religion - in such a way that utterly and completely destroys any sort of moral compass that should be possessed by any decent human being. That isn't to say I dont agree with these athiest's opinions, I just generally don't agree with the way in which they chose to argue it. 

 I would also just like to clarify that I am well educated on the reasons why I don't believe in any religion. After frequenting r/atheism, I became incredibly intrigued on the topic, so I did my research (including reading the Bible).

And so I decided to see what it was like on the other side; I came to r/Christianity. From all the hatred, all the blind, judgemental thoughts of r/atheism, I suppose I was expecting some sort of reciprocation. Surely r/Christianity would have a lot to say about atheist life? I was totally wrong. I was also totally blown away by the love and compassion emitting from this subreddit. I saw nothing but kind words of help, condolence and positive energy. 

I just really wanted to say (I even made a reddit account just to post this), that this subreddit has made me a better person, undoubtedly. I felt the weight of the judgment I held lifting from my shoulders, and I believe I am a much better person for it. I know it's been said by many other non-religious people already, but I had to say it myself;this subreddit is the definition of goodness. This is from one person to anyone who cares to read. I don't see myself as religious, I don't see myself as atheist, I just see myself as a person, as I would see any of you, and I can see many of the people on this subreddit are kind, respectful and highly respectable people.

Again, thank you for being who you are. Youve earned my deepest respect.

As such, my opinion of most Christians has typically not been very high--in one instance someone will preach love and acceptance, and in another they will spew vitriolic hate and criticism at others, simply for being different in faith, culture, sexual orientation, etc.

So when I checked this sub-reddit out, I was expecting a similarly mixed basket. Instead, I found very interesting, thought-provoking discussions about Christian issues and experiences. There is much less hate here than on r/atheism ; )

Sometimes I hear Christians complain about being persecuted against, or ostracized because of their faith. This is because many have had bad experiences with people affiliated with Christianity, and regard you as similarly hateful and oppressive.

I am probably not telling you anything you don't know. The point of this was just to say that if you downplay the condemnation, and instead have empathetic, accepting discussions, you can really affect how others view you as a whole. Speaking as someone who was pretty close to being a ""militant"" atheist, you made me give the subject of religion some serious re-thinking.

After mulling it over for a while, I decided that a creator could certainly exist, although Christianity still isn't how I would personally interpret the universe. Moreover, I no longer think ALL Christians are necessarily a cause of suffering in society, and will try not to think less of someone simply for having faith.

TL;DR: I am impressed with your well-thought discussions, and wanted to let you know how powerful they were in changing my opinion of Christianity.

I said ""Hallelejuah!"" and he then gave me a funny look. I said that I believe Christianity has been it's best and most compassionate when it's been dismantled as a worldly power. Yes, Christians die and are persecuted for being the minority even now, but they also have a very authentic faith that doesn't oppress people or seek political gain. I believe the anti-Christ is the Christ who is portrayed as the oppressor, not the defender, of the weak and poor.

His counter was that sounds lubby-dubby but what would I do if my kids necks were on the chopping block unless they professed Allah as God. I said that would be their choice, but I would want them to stand firm with Jesus as the Liberator. If they did not, I would know in my heart Jesus would still reach them somehow. 

Matthew 10:33 gives a dark picture of those who deny Christ. What do  you guys think of that?

I think we could (and more importantly, should!) do this, if not through World Vision than possibly through micro-financing or another charity.

So. How should we do it?

Combining forces with the folks at r/atheism is going to help far more needy people than what r/Christianity can raise alone. Let's make this a friendly competition where we work together to help sick and dying people.

[Still, we've also got a page set up to donate to World Vision's clean water fund](http://www.firstgiving.com/rchristianity) (chosen because firstgiving is a good group fundraising site and the CWF is closest to the original idea of medical care), because I know some of you would rather (or will only) donate to a Christian charity and I just hope we can help as many people as possible in whatever way possible, **but I sincerely urge you to split your donation and give equally to *both* efforts.**

1356305298.0,139,self.Christianity,15cha7,In the debate about same sex marriage there is one misleading claim we as Christians make which I would like to nail because it turns out the opposite is true,crazybones,270,131,409,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/15cha7/in_the_debate_about_same_sex_marriage_there_is/,"An oft repeated argument by many of my fellow Christians is that by allowing gay marriage we will undermine the institution of marriage, that somehow gay people marrying will hurt the whole concept of marriage.

As far as I can see the reality is the complete opposite of this. If you look at marriage as an institution the people who are doing all the undermining are people like me - i.e. heterosexuals.

If anything, homosexuals are strengthening marriage by wanting to get married.

Allow me to explain.

We heterosexuals can hardly call ourselves a positive force for marriage. Just look at all the things we are doing collectively without any help from our gay brothers and sisters:

1. High divorce rates
2. Extra marital affairs
3. Couples living together without getting married
4. Domestic violence
5. And on a smaller scale: cases of bigamy and marriages of convenience to gain passports.

By contrast look at what the gay community is doing for marriage. Their enthusiasm and eagerness to have the right to marry has reminded all of us how precious marriage is and what a privilege it is to be able to marry.

Because of this campaign by gay people, many heterosexuals now see the institution of marriage in a new and more positive light.

Yet another reason why allowing gay people to marry seems to me to be a fundamentally good thing.

A further point is that the argument that gay marriage will undermine heterosexual marriage is just patently stupid. If a married gay couple comes to live next door to me, how will that undermine my marriage? Is gay marriage like some kind of infection that can be passed through the air?

How would my marriage be any less strong because two married gay people are living next door? Are people suggesting that I might decide the time has come for me to jump ship and sail in the opposite direction? What possible difference can it make to me or my wife that we have a same sex married couple next door?

The more I look at the arguments presented by the anti gay marriage lobby, the more ludicrous and illogical they seem.

EDIT

I'd like to thank all those who commented no matter what they said. I'd also like to thank everyone who voted, whether the arrow they clicked was pointing my post up to heaven or down to hell.

It's impossible to reply to every single comment so I would just like to make a general response. 

It seems to me that many (though not all) of the people who are objecting to same sex marriage are failing to come up with anything of real substance in response to my post but are merely arguing about semantics. A good example of this is the highest voted post from yukerboy.

This is a classic diversionary tactic when people haven't really got much of an answer. And the reason why they don't have much of an answer is because at the heart of this whole issue is a major contradiction. Namely that we say that we as Christians are loving people and yet on this issue we have a very unloving response to gay people - i.e. we are trying our best to ensure that a much persecuted and demonized minority group stays persecuted and demonized.

In the midst of all this are some wonderfully illogical observations. For example from one person we get the suggestion that gay people should not be allowed to marry because when they are unmarried they are promiscuous and unfaithful to their partners. And from the same person comes the bizarre comparison of divorce rates between married heterosexual couples and unmarried homosexual couples. I hate to point this out but unmarried people cannot divorce.

And finally, a few people have quoted Bible verses to me, but these are just the convenient ones that they happen to approve of today. There are dozens and dozens of verses in the Bible which we Christians do not observe. It's easy to pick on people who are condemned in the Bible when they only make up 5 percent of the population, but when St Paul, for example, tells us that women should be silent in church we kind of ignore that one, because they happen to make up 50 percent of the population.

In the past few months, I have realized that pretty much everything I know about Christianity has been tainted by Mormonism. Could I ask for a few clarifications?",CranialEruption,187,43,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/13yjam/i_grew_up_mormon_now_an_atheist_but_i_still_like/,"The more time I spend looking at Christianity from a perspective outside of Mormonism, the more I become convinced that there *are* a lot of doctrinal problems between the two, no matter how much Mormons tell themselves otherwise. To that end, I'd like to clear up some misunderstandings I may have about Christian doctrine. This may turn in to a long post, so bear with me.

1. We'll start with the big one, the nature of God. Mormons see God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost as three discrete beings, but united in one purpose. They use scriptures such as John 17:3 (Jesus praying to God and referring to the two as different beings) and  Acts 7:55-56 (Stephen sees the Son of Man [Jesus] standing on the right hand of God) to back up these claims. As I understand it, the Christian view of God is more along the lines of three different faces of the same Being. Am I thinking about that right? Where did that belief come from, and why is it such a huge point of contention between the two?

2. The other big one, Salvation. In most of Christianity that's not Catholicism, salvation comes through the grace of God. All you have to do is confess your belief in Jesus and you'll be saved, right? In Mormonism, belief in Jesus is part of it, but other things are required as well. For instance, Mormonism requires the living of a good, moral life and keeping God's commandments in order to obtain salvation, but still believe they are saved by grace after all they can do. So my questions are these: a) Where does the incentive to have good actions come in for a Christian who is saved only by grace? Couldn't a person do whatever they wanted, sinned as much as possible, then when dying confess a belief in Jesus and be saved? b) One of the biggest condemnations of Mormonism I've heard from Christians is that Mormonism believes in salvation through works and not through grace. I don't see why it has to be a binary one or the other thing. Don't Jesus and the Apostles emphasize the importance of good works, particularly in Matthew 17:21?

3. The Theodicy and the problem of evil. Mormonism deals with this by saying this life is a test, and just as a teacher in a classroom desires students to do well in the class, they still can't interfere with tests. Evil comes from Satan, who tempts men to not follow God. [NOTE: The big problem I have with the Mormon treatment of the theodicy is, while teachers can't interfere with tests, they also don't give out 10,000 different versions of what students will be tested on, and then let some idiot screw with the people taking the test. I could go on, if necessary].

4. Mormonism holds that sometime after Jesus died, there was an apostasy from his teachings and the Church that he established fell. Christianity, obviously, disagrees with this. Mormonism also holds that men must be given authority from God in order to act in his name, called the Priesthood. They believe the correct priesthood was restored to the prophet Joseph Smith. I know this particular doctrine can be very different from church to church, some churches believing authority comes from the scriptures, some believing it was passed down linearly from Pope to Pope, and some believing it's not needed at all. Why such the disparity, and why would God's church be so disjointed in seemingly important areas such as this if not for some sort of Great Apostasy?

That's what I can think of for now, hope I didn't overwhelm y'all. I'll probably have more later, and my wife may have more to add to the conversation as well. Thanks in advance for the explanations.

EDIT: Thought of another one - the cross. Mormons don't use the cross in any of their worship, architecture, or decorative knick-knacks to hang in their living rooms. If you wear a cross to a Mormon service, you'll probably get some funny looks. Mormons say they'd rather remember how Jesus lived, and not how he died. How did the cross become such a big part of Christianity? Isn't the Ichthus the oldest Christian symbol? You still see it from time to time, but not nearly as much as the cross. Do they have any meaning other than a symbol of the Christian faith? Do Christians look down on people who *don't* display the cross?",,False,,t5_2qh6c,1354142635.0,,scarlet,True,t3_13yjam,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/13yjam/i_grew_up_mormon_now_an_atheist_but_i_still_like/,

God is awesome.",dcss,209,70,229,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/qs679/an_answered_prayer_and_an_end_to_confusion_god_is/,"So before I fully decided to dedicate my life to God I used to use *a lot* of drugs. When I properly accepted Him as the right way of life I put all of those things down. That was around 6 months ago now.

However, the last few weeks I have been musing on if certain drugs really are a sin. I was thinking mainly about cannabis. After all, I believe God created the plant and he called it ""very good"". I had read a variety of peoples views on cannabis use and sin, and it's mentionings in the bible. But still, I was not 100% sure one way or another if it was forbidden.

One of the things that I *did* believe made cannabis a sin is the fact it is against the law. This took me onto thinking about one of the main drugs I used to use which is a research chemical named AM-2201. I used to smoke a hell of a lot of this stuff and it ended up giving me some quite bad lung pain, I would also cough up nasty black phlegm etc. The pain got very, very bad. I tried to tell myself that I would stop, because I was clearly having some rather serious negative health issues. But even still I could not stick to this promise and I would continue to smoke through the pain. Remember this, it is important for what comes next.

This drug is legal in my country, and the effects are the exact same as cannabis, albeit *much* stronger. I was contemplating buying some. I told myself I could keep it under control, smoking only at nights. What's so bad about it anyway? It's legal, so no sin there. It has the same effects as a God made plant. I can keep it under control. Anyway, there wouldn't be any health implications if I wasn't smoking so much, right?

These were my thoughts. But before I made the order I *had* to get an answer from my Father. I had to know for sure one way or the other. So I simply prayed for a clear cut answer, ""Lord, is it bad?"".

A little while later I decided to pick up my bible and read from the book of Daniel, a book I had never read. It was on page 1095. I flick through and land on page 1095 first time. I had a feeling God really wanted me to read this book.. Now, in my bible it has these little note/comments that have been added in by whomever published or put together the bible. They generally have real life applications or ideas about what the teaching of this particular part of the bible means for us in our lives today. So there I was, reading Daniel chapter one and my eyes move towards one of these notes. And this is what it read:

&gt;Daniel resolved not to defile himself with the king's rich foods. Have you ever made a similar resolution to abstain from certain foods or drinks in an effort to keep your body healthy?  If so, how strong did your commitment prove to be?  How did you feel about yourself as a result of your commitment?
&gt;The Bible makes it clear that, as Christians, our bodies belong to God. We don't have the freedom to mistreat them or do with them as we wish.
&gt;You see, he expects us to present ourselves and our bodies as pure sacrifices to his service. Be body smart.

WOW! I couldn't believe my eyes! It seems to me that this is quite clearly God speaking directly into my situation. No doubt, some atheists will yell ""coincidence!"" though..

How awesome! Just what I asked for, a clear answer on how God sees this topic. I feel so happy now that I know what His feelings are about this and now I can stop thinking about it.

I wasn't expecting anything so I immediately opened it up. There was a letter inside and another envelope. The letter said the following: 

&gt;I am the local director of a youth organization that volunteered at the city library for one of their activities a few weeks ago. The activity was to write a card/letter to someone to show how thankful you are to them for Thanksgiving. Your daughter wrote her letter to Jesus. She wanted to make sure it got to him, but I'm sure He saw every word she wrote. I thought you would like to have her letter that she wrote for safekeeping.&lt;

Before going much further, I would like to note that my daughter is 7 and a real firecracker. I love her to pieces but sometimes (daily) she makes me vow to never have any more kids! Also she goes to the library after school since they have activities for her to do until I get off work.

After reading this I looked at the other envelope. It was plain white with my daughter's name and address in the top left and ""Jesus"" in the bottom center hand written by her with purple pencil. I opened it up and it was a note that simply said &gt; Dear Jesus thank you for dying for us. I love you. Signed little_red &gt;

This really impacted me because even though I believe, we don't go to church. Sometimes she goes with her grandparents but has probably only been there a handful of times. My husband doesn't believe and the only church within 30 minutes is a very small Lutheran church that just doesn't do anything for me. I've been thinking about making the drive to a church where I would be comfortable and taking my kids with me. I know I should do so at all costs.

I cried like a baby after reading the simple thank you that my daughter had written. It really made everything else fade away and seem so petty and not needed.

I do, however, still have a great interest in the workings of religion and am genuinely curious about how it shapes culture and the various systems of morality (even with Christianity you see a large difference in extremes). I go to a Catholic high school in Oklahoma and was raised in the faith for all but one year of my life (being the most recent). I am very familiar with Catholicism and the general preachings thereof, but have very little contact with protestants just by situation not choice.

I say all this to show why I care. Everyone I know is Catholic or Christian which means their faith affects me in a big way too. I haven't lost the frame of mind to phrase things from their point of view and that's what I'm going to do here, I will even capitalize God (even if it is a bit like saying you live in City). This has been a growing issue and I can't quite take much more of it without doing something, so I've taken this step before my anger rises to replace my gentler emotions.

There has been a slew of bannings. A massacre of bannings, a decimation, a genocide of bannings from /r/Christianity. I don't know if many people here read /r/atheism but I know many atheists read /r/Christianity. I have only to wonder, is it Christian behavior to ban non-Christian views? People do not get banned for not being atheists or expressing differing opinions, so why does it happen here? would God honestly be pleased that instead of respecting thine enemy and forgiving every offense you instead clot your ears and yell ""blah lah lah lah lah!"" This is **NOT** Christian behavior. This is the splinter in the eye of the Christian community, intolerance. I do not mind if you claim that a supernatural, omnipotent being exists. No matter how unlikely his details either, I don't care if he has eight tongues and no mouth. However, when you treat your fellow people badly then I take offense. Does God smile upon that sort of action?

He does not! I have never heard a view of God in which his nay sayers should even be considered a bother. In fact for my 16 years of Catholicism I learned tht those who didn't believe in him should be pitied, loved, and talked to the most. No one likes direct conversion, but every effort has to be put forth to save their souls. Imagine getting to the pearly gates and being denied entrance because you could have saved that heretic from eternal damnation and chose instead to pretend his opinion didn't even exist. This sort of intolerant stake burning is why anti-theists exist. Atheists generally arrive at their stance via philosophy and their own view of the world (which i will not affirm here even if I take it as well). Anti-theists see your hypocrisy, the beam in your eye, and come to the conclusion that religion can only cause a net negative result.

So I beseech the mods and members of /r//Christianity, please stop banning us. If someone is provably rude, such as calling you ""stupid religious persons,"" or if they should be removed for the basic ban reasons (blogspam and tampering). However, if this spree of ban-hammers continues to rain down like a hurricane I shall have lost hope for this community and my only hope is that God has mercy upon you. Anonymity is not an excuse for sin.

I'd like to remind you I am only one, unorganized atheist, and my opinions do not represent the community as a whole or even part. I cannot claim the support of anyone other than myself in this. Have a nice day.

&gt;Today, I bring to you one of my most interesting thoughts in recent times. This post is on God, and His possible ""scientific"" explanation of existence through an interesting line of logic that is seemingly valid. This logic is on the theories of multi-dimensional beings, and only considering up to the 4th dimension.


&gt;We humans. We are in the 3rd dimension. We are 3-dimensional beings, as in X, Y, and Z. We have the power to move though this 3rd dimension and do with any object as we please. When we speak or make a sound, all sound can be defined in the 2nd dimension as a wavelength, or X and Y. The one thing we are immediately lacking is the power of 4th-dimension modifications, which is time. We are stuck with time being an ""all powerful"" force which we cannot touch.


&gt;Now for science! Any object that has a shadow loses one dimension. Hold your hand to a lamp and look at the shadow. Every part of the shadow is perfectly flat on a surface. It can be defined as X and Y on a flat surface. All 3-dimensional objects become 2-dimensional in shadow-form. A shadow is an ""image"" or ""likeness"" of the original object. Take note of the Tesserect here. 4th dimensional objects casts 3-dimensional shadows. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract


&gt;Now for theory. God exists outside of our world. He exists outside of Time. An all-knowing existence would live at the very least in the 4th dimension. In the 4th dimension, God would have the power to move through time at His leisure, and be completely unbound by said time. The fun part here: As with us humans, every little thing we do loses a dimension. Our voice is a 2D wavelength. Our shadow is a 2D image. God has a +1 dimension. When God spoke the world into existence, as a 4th-dimensional being, His voice would literally be 3-dimensional objects. Speaking in 3D! In the beginning of Genesis 26 it says, ""Then God said, “Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness"" To be an ""image"" or ""likeness"" of God Himself would make us shadows of Him, losing a dimension from 4th to 3rd.


&gt;God spoke objects, creating our world. God cast us as a shadow of Himself, as a likeness to His own being. In the very least, God can actually be roughly but logically defined in the 4th dimension.


I don't know about you, but I found this to be very thought-provoking. Not only that, but it actually made sense! Feel free to discuss this, I'm interested to see what other people think about it.

Edit: I realize some of you are pointing out some flaws in what my friend said (i.e. sound isn't actually 2-dimentional). While this is true, I don't think that's necessarily the point of what my friend wants to say. He's simply making an observation on how we interact with the world (3D to 2D) and how God interacts with the world (4D to 3d) and making a connection.

Worst part is, he's on the opposite side of the country and I don't know if or when I'll be able to get back to Rochester, NY to see him. (I live in New Orleans)

He's always been a really strong believer, as he grew up Catholic and raised us Catholic, even though I left the church a long time ago.

Personally it never really caught on for me, but it's been important to my Mom and Dad, so I guess I'm just sharing this difficult time, hoping it'll get a little easier. If not for me, then maybe for my Mom. 

Anyway, I don't know if anybody will actually read this. I'm just really struggling and feel lost right now. I guess it can't hurt to ask for prayers, because at this point that's all I've got left.

Edit: I just wanted to say thank you to everybody who has posted here for your kind words, actions, thoughts, prayers, and suggestions. It's made the most difficult time in my life a little more bearable. I'm absolutely floored by the outpouring of love sent my way, from complete strangers. It's comforting to know that there is always support out there when you need it, even if it's from a source you don't expect.

Edit 2: A few people have suggested donating money to send me to see my Dad, and I just wanted to let you know that it's not a money issue that's keeping me from getting up there immediately. I'm in graduate school and my father worked really hard his entire life to be able to send me to school, and wants me to commit to my studies unless it's the end, and I should have enough heads up with life support to be able to be at his bedside if we ever get to that point. I'd much rather see the money donated to a charity if you're so inclined. Thank you for the kind thought though. =)

UPDATE: I just wanted to give an update. Dad isn't improving at all, but he's not getting worse, so I've decided I'll be flying home this weekend to be with my family for a few days.

We have Baptists, Bible-Church, Pentecostal, Christian Church, Anglican, Assemblies of God, and other groups represented.

But what was really cool was what happened this morning. We gathered together, 31 ministers in all, and did a full blown Eucharist (first time many of them had experienced liturgy at all), and as a group of local pastors renewed our vows to be faithful to God, the Word, and one another in serving our churches. It was just an astonishing display of Christian unity that crossed denominational and cultural boundaries.

My wife and I will be visiting a friend's Anglican church this Sunday. We had a conversation yesterday about it and my wife expressed to me that she was worried about the worship. I asked what she was worried about specifically. She said that she was worried our daughter's ability to expression herself through dance may be squelched. This is because we just came out of an evangelical church that welcomed dancing, jumping and wild expressions during the worship service.

I told her that our daughter could still dance before God...just probably not in the church service. This upset my wife, who believes that dancing before Jesus is a good thing and one should feel free to do it in a church service.  She said that if people are distracted it's their own problem, not the problem of the person that's dancing. 

Now, I'm not opposed to dancing in worship. Heck, I've done it many times myself in the past. However, I now feel less inclined to be in a church service that allows it because I'm done seeking emotional spiritual highs and I would rather strip all that out so that I can seek God in a more structured environment. It's one of the things that appeals to me about this church we're going to.

So, do any of you have any reasons or scriptures you can give me to show my wife that dancing may not always be the sincerest way to worship AND that I'm not going to traumatize or active, dancing toddler if I only let her dance at home?

**EDIT**: I should add that we're not just visiting -we're trying the church out to see if it's a good fit for us. I've thoroughly grilled my friend about what the Anglican church believes and I'm excited to check it out just for some meaty theology. However, my wife is way less concerned about doctrine and is therefore more concerned about the personal, relational aspects of the church. Both are important, but we might reach an impasse if we can't find a way to make the two mesh.

**EDIT 2**: I'm gonna hold off from broaching the subject until after Sunday. Heck, my wife may not even care if she likes over 90% of the church stuff.",,False,,t5_2qh6c,True,,chirho,True,t3_jnr63,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/jnr63/sound_doctrine_vs_lively_worship/,

Over the past couple months I have been re-evaluating a lot of things in my life, not the least of which is how I spend my time.  2 years ago when my son was born, I had to give up singing in my church choir, which was very rewarding to me personally, because I could not properly balance my responsibilities to my wife, son, and high school ministry if I was still trying to do that as well.

In the past couple weeks I have been praying about my involvement here and God has made it clear to me that moderating here is not on the list of things he has for me to do.  When I do spend time on it, most of that time is while I'm at work, where I should be working rather than redditing (if he wanted me to work as a moderator he would lead me to find employment actually doing that, not writing software!).  

At home, reddit takes time away from my family.  My dad spent much of my life focused more on his computer than on me, and I refuse to follow that example now that I have a son of my own.

I am also actively involved in one ministry and about to embark on another, and both of these are the result of clear promptings by God that they are what I am to do, while moderating here has always just been something I fancied myself suited for.

Some of you may wonder if the pressures or difficulties that come along with being a mod are playing a hand in that, and while I will say that they did lead me to start contemplating this decision, I know that if God wanted me here, he would give me the wisdom and the motivation to work through any problems that might arise.  But instead he's shown me that while this work is good, it is not the work he has for me personally, and that I am more valuable to him elsewhere.

The other mods are in the process of naming some new mods to pick up the slack that already existed around here.  Maybe the timing of my stepping down is good, in that it will allow them to pick the right amount of mods and potentially look for people who can fill any gaps that I might be leaving.

This isn't goodbye, I'll still be around, though admittedly less active.  I'm very excited to complete my 4-year stint as a high school small group leader as strongly as I can and to enter my new ministry opportunity, helping men who are struggling to live out their faith with integrity.

Thanks for all the support and encouragement I've received from many of you over the past couple years, and for the friendships I've built here.  I look forward to seeing God continue to work here, and pray that he will help build a mod team of people that HE wants to do this work, rather than people who want to do it for their own pleasure.

A book that greatly helped me get my life, priorities, and spiritual walk sorted out is called [Disciplines of a Godly Man](http://www.amazon.com/Disciplines-Godly-Revised-Edition-Complete/dp/1581342861) by Kent Hughes.

This is my first ever post, so please forgive me if I violate any reddiquette. Please pardon the massive wall of text coming your way!

My wife and I have been married for around 4 years, with a 2 year old child. We're both Christians, and I'm currently the youth pastor in my Church. 

She was diagnosed with depression around a year ago, but has been struggling with it for much longer. About a month ago, things just began to fall apart. She began going out for long, very late night drives because she just couldn't bear to be around me. When she got home she told me that she'd been smoking, because it was the only way she could unwind and deal with everything.

She's told me that she's been struggling with feelings for someone else in the Church; she feels unable to be herself around me and so has been living a lie for our whole marriage. She 'doesn't understand us' anymore, and so is unable to give me a straight answer as to whether we'll still be together in a few months. She's thought about moving out for a while, just so that she'd miss me and appreciate me again.

She says that, intellectually, she understands that I'm a model husband (her words)- I treat her like a princess (again, a quote), I look after her and our house and our family, she can't fault me as a husband or a father. She just doesn't know if she's in love with me anymore, and she doesn't know if she can stay married to me. 

In all honesty, I feel in my heart that she's already left me, and she's just sticking around for our child. 

Spiritually she's nowhere, and that's just making it all worse. We've started seeing a counsellor, but I don't even see what the point is because I think she's checked out. I love her and want to be with her, but I feel like I'm pushing water uphill.

Her anti-depressants have been upped, and I'd hoped that was causing it all, but I don't believe that anymore- I think they're just enabling her to speak her heart.

I feel like I'm dying, and I don't know what I can do. I'm currently sleeping in our child's bedroom, and I'm really afraid that this is the end of my marriage. I know you ca't fix it, but I suppose I just needed to offload.

And a big thanks to this subreddit. ,francophonic,167,30,88,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1666ga/ive_come_back_to_faith_overwhelming_experiences/,"I've come back to faith in Jesus. After about four and a half years of atheism...

Just for a touch of back story: I was born to not-that-into-it Baptist parents (of an Arminian branch) and I converted to Catholicism when I was younger with quite a lot of zeal. My parents originally were against this and I was forbidden to go to a Catholic Church so I was actually baptized Methodist, but it was unsatisfying and finally my parents relented and let me join the RCC. They actually ended up very supportive. I adored the RCC and even felt called to ordination for most of my adolescence. In college, I drifted from the RCC and finally fell away completely. Issues of my sexuality, new philosophies, irritating theology study that seemed like I was always butting my head against a wall...all of it meant that I became an atheist and I became one **hard**. I viewed all those years of privately studying theology and patristics and languages as years that were *stolen* from me. I was angry. 


My pent up anger at sexuality issues, at my local parish's constant political ranting and poor liturgy (very, very bad at some points) came spilling up and got regurgitated out into a New Atheism that could strip the paint off the walls. I used blasphemy as a weapon. All the faithful were targets. I hated them. I hated myself. I longed to make them as miserable as I was. 


I never could shake religion though. The one quote that has stuck with me consistently in my spiritual journey is that beautiful quote from *The End of the Affair*: ""I have caught belief like a disease."" I never could shut up about Jesus. I hated him (so I said) but I couldn't get enough. I drove everyone near me almost to a breaking point because all I wanted to talk about was religion. I honestly couldn't swerve the conversation to anything besides this thing I claimed was a colossal waste of time. I tried desperately to make a non-theistic religious path work for me. I flirted with Pagans with loose beliefs about pantheism and tried until I was blue in the face to make Buddhism work for me. Hell, there are a couple of comments I've made just a few weeks ago (maybe less than that) on r/Buddhism trying to make it work, trying desperately to love anything...anything but Jesus. 


All that time bitching and moaning about Christianity...and it was all I read. Every nonfiction book. Whether it was rereading St. Augustine's *Confessions* or Karl Barth or Chesterton or whatever; it's all I gobbled down. It's all I grabbed at. 


Finally the other night I just stopped. I just stopped everything. I fell down on my bed and just admitted that I could run and screech and yell all I wanted but I couldn't stop it...I was in love with Christianity. I was in love Jesus. I was angry at the wrong thing. So I recommitted myself to my faith. I slowly removed the atheist bumper stickers and posters from my walls. I re-shelved my Bibles, theology books, religious memoirs, books on hermeneutics and church history (the ones I kept in the bottom drawer near my bed). And I felt this immense relief. Like my entire body just released. I felt that feeling you get when a horrid pain in your back finally lets go and you sigh in relief. Or I felt like someone who had been desperately trying to have conversations in a country where I wasn't fluent in the language and finally finding someone who spoke my own. I felt like I was coming home, to a warm home with my favorite meal already cooked and steaming.


I'm examining myself daily, reading as much as ever, and thinking about whether or not this entire experience might have been my freakish reaction/revolt against a true call to some ministry in my life (nothing specific as of yet, and doing this right...with an adviser and constant prayer). I'm joining the Episcopal Church (with which I've had a lot of experiences) within the next couple of weeks and starting back on that old ""disease of belief."" 


Thanks to this subreddit for giving me my daily fix of faith and being a part, however big or small, of the breaking point that brought back the deluge of faith into my life.

AMAA.",weeping_prophet,177,44,369,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/pxt4p/iama_member_of_a_ultraconservative_mennonite/,"I posted an AMA about a month ago in r/IAmA. The thread was soon taken over by a lot of discussion about my belief in creation and my brief stint as an atheist. However, I got the feeling that there were other redditors who were interested in the lifestyle and beliefs of conservative Mennonites. Our church is what I consider moderately conservative, but the general public looks at us as ultra-conservative.

I don't view the church as ""conservative"", but rather as ""orthodox"" and ""apostolic"". That is, I believe that our church holds closest to the original early church as operated by the apostles.

I am fairly familiar with the beliefs and practices of other conservative Anabaptist groups, such as the Hutterites and the Amish, so I can answer some general questions about them as well.

Here's a brief rundown of our practices and beliefs.

We wear conservative, modest clothes. 
My wife wears a dress and a prayer covering. 
We men wear beards. 
We don't use radio or television, and we don't watch movies. 
We don't use musical instruments. 
All internet access must be filtered. (We use parental controls or content filters like NetNanny.) 
A brief, simple explanation for our approach towards practical matters can be summed up as ""modesty, simplicity and economy"". 
Also, we practice church discipline, including excommunication and avoidance.

Doctrinally, we believe in God as a holy trinity (Father, Son and Holy Spirit). 
We believe that God created man with a free will in order that we might freely choose to worship him. 
We believe that man chose not to worship God and were therefore condemned to eternal punishment. 
We believe that God's son Jesus chose to give his life as a payment for our sins. 
We believe that salvation comes only from our acceptance of Jesus' sacrifice, and not from any works we can do. 
We believe that all those who knowingly and deliberately reject God and his plan will be condemned to Hell. 
We believe in the inerrancy of God's Word, including a literal 6-day creation.

I would be happy to answer most questions. However, I would rather debate questions relating to the basis of Christianity or relating to a literal 6-day creation elsewhere.",,False,,t5_2qh6c,False,,menn,True,t3_pxt4p,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/pxt4p/iama_member_of_a_ultraconservative_mennonite/,

I'm a see-saw on the religious scale: born and raised a United Methodist, a long-time skeptic of much of organized religion, still highly active at church (and fairly open about my beliefs and/or disbeliefs). My best friends are, atheists, Christians, and much in between.

""The end of law is not to abolish or restrain,"" he explained, ""but to preserve and enlarge freedom. For in all the states of created beings capable of law, where there is no law, there is no freedom.""

Our desire to afford users of [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity) the greatest freedom possible has sometimes meant a lax approach to enforcing our Community Policy.  We've long felt that this subreddit should be responsible for policing itself and have only stepped in where absolutely necessary.  Our fingers are never far from the pulse of this community, however, and in conversations with you we've found that the majority of [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity) subscribers are dissatisfied with the level of discourse.  This is due in large part to the lack of a truly coherent Community Policy and a relaxed approach to moderation.  

As a result, we've spent the last couple of months discussing, developing, and revising a Community Policy that will better serve the community.  The origin of this Community Policy is *the users*, not the moderators of [/r/Christianity](/r/Christianity). It is designed to the end suggested by John Locke - *not* to restrict, censor, or impede discussion by our subscribers, but to enhance, promote, and encourage it.  

The new Community Policy is specific in terms of enumerating some unacceptable behaviors, but the categories themselves are broad enough to allow us room for interpretation.  We've added stronger language in support of a case-by-case approach to moderation.  Violations will be met with action depending on severity.    

Feel free to discuss below.  We will be linking this in the sidebar and submitting it to our policy forum.  
_______

**This is /r/Christianity's Community Policy.**

It is called a ""Community Policy"" because it was written by the moderators of /r/Christianity on the basis of feedback from our Community as a whole - Christians and non-Christians alike. Because it was written at the behest of the Community, the moderators of /r/Christianity reserve the right to enforce it as they see fit with the express support and in the best interests of the Community.

1. **No spamming**.
2. **No harassment**.
3. **No bigotry**. This includes [secular](http://mw1.m-w.com/dictionary/secular) [traditional](http://www.contentious.com/2008/10/13/traditional-bigotry/) [bigotry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bigotry) (racism, sexism, derogatory names, slurs) and [anti-chrisitian bigotry](http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2011/12/14/anti-christian-bigotry-joshua-hammerman/) (""[zombie Jesus](http://altreligion.about.com/b/2011/04/24/the-hypocrisy-of-zombie-jesus-day.htm),"" ""sky fairy,"" ""you believe in fairy tales,"" equating religion with racism).
4. **No conduct detrimental to healthy discourse**. This includes anything used to substantially alter the topic of a comment thread (disparaging ""WWJD,"" ""how Christian of you,"" and similar asides).
5. **No advocating or promoting a non-Christian agenda**. Criticizing the faith, stirring debate, or championing alternative belief systems are not appropriate here. (Such discussions may be suited to /r/DebateReligion.)
6. **No [karma-begging](http://www.reddit.com/r/atheism/comments/dxyry/why_visiting_rchristianity_breaks_my_heart/) to mob a thread or commentor**. This is also called vote brigading, karmajacking, or vote mobbing, and applies to all comments, submissions, and posts. For this reason, cross-posts are strongly discouraged and may be removed.
7. **If you must submit a meme, add the link to a self post**. This includes image macros, rage comics, advice animals, and similar content.
8. **Repetitious posts covered by the FAQ may be removed**.

While we welcome most general discussions about Christianity by anyone, this subreddit exists primarily for discussions about Christianity by Christians.

**We enforce the aforementioned rules according to the spirit rather than the precise letter of the Community Policy.  Violations may result in warnings, comment removal, and account bans.**

___

Please help us enforce this policy by reminding offenders this is a moderated community, upvoting good content, downvoting bad content, and using the ""report"" button liberally.  As always, feel free to contact us with questions or concerns with the ""Message the Moderators"" link to the right.  Thank you for trusting us with these responsibilities - it is a joy to serve /r/Christianity.

Do us a favor and upvote this so that it gets seen - I remind you that self-posts result in no karma.

**EDIT CONCERNING RULE 5**:  It seems a considerable amount of consternation exists over the specific wording of this rule.  What it is intended to do is *not* to stymie interfaith dialogue or to allow certain expressions of the faith to be derided as ""un-Christian.""

EDIT THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK: Would you guys want this done on ureddit, or would you want a private subreddit where people can come in and participate? It would be by invitation only though. I'd still be able to post lectures and such. 

EDIT RETURN OF THE JEDI: Wow, kind of surprised at the response. I was thinking ureddit, but to make it easier, I might create a subreddit and make it invitation only. Still thinking of a curriculum, readings, assignments etc.... But more than likely, it will cover the basic areas of systematic theology. 

The Phantom EDIT: Ok it looks like there's interest. I'll get started on a syllabus and reading. I'll probably make it an invitation only subreddit. Ok guys I'll post  on this in the next few weeks.

Forgive me but I'm tired.  I'm tired of lurking this subreddit only to be constantly barraged by what I can only take, after two years, to be your incessant desire to push your beliefs onto others. Now you folks know who you are! It's not all of you by any means. I just honestly feel that any link with even a semblance of popularity has to run the gauntlet of your, well... hate. 

Now from my perspective let me explain. There is a clique, a clique whose imperative seems to be nothing save to put down those of us who find strength in the Lord, and it leaves me at a loss! EVERYDAY. This isn't reddit.com my friends, this is a subreddit - a place where people of a like mind come to exchange ideas and feelings with those of a similar nature. Yet *many* of you, and I apologize for subcategorizing atheists so simply (Lord knows it happens with Christians), many of you seem to come here with no other intent then to ferment anger, distrust, and actual hatred! The thought occurs; how many of you who would respond with harsh words are subscribed to other religions threads? Do you post and downvote them with such consistency? What gain can I ask, do you recieve with your constant diatribes?

Please, I'll be the first to say that many of the posts and links in this thread make me... well, sad. Appalled even. But we're human just like you, we're struggling with life just like you! Questions, responses, answers... incorrect answers. Yet I feel that what many of you refuse to understand is that many of us have the same secular education as you, the SAME. We've read books, we've had discussions and arguments, we've held the same jobs, interacted with the ""same"" people! We live in the exact same city, state, and country as you, and FRANKLY, after all those same lessons we've come to our own rational, physical, mental, and spiritual decisions! 

Personally, and again forgive me, but many of your downvotes and uninformed comments are oftentimes unwelcome, and actually strengthen my belief! I *love* reason, rationality, debate, logic - I'm like you! If you have a comment or thought that is in disagreement with said post, leave it! But I for one, am personally and honestly beyond tired of many (not all) of your absolute and unrequited need to press your beliefs or OPINIONS onto me! There are numerous Christian faiths and doctrines. *PLEASE* atl least realize that much! I just ask you, honestly beg you at this poiint... as we *all* should (mark that my fellow Christians); practice what you preach. 

Please my friends, don't be so quick to judge and to convict - spend your time wisely! Debate with us, it's oh so dang important. But recognize that this is the CHRISTIAN subreddit! People see things differently then you! 

Edit: I've received no comments yet, but I do want to make clear that my frustration doesn't encompass ALL... I don't mean all, I mean many. Not most, not some, not the few... many. Honestly I struggle with addressing ""you"" because I feel this oncoming onslaught of hate and its not my intent ;( I'm just a single person whos frustration has boiled over after a couple of years, and I'm doing my best to relate that feeling.",,False,,t5_2qh6c,True,,orthodox,True,t3_gbpez,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/gbpez/to_many_of_the_atheists_lying_in_wait/,

PLEASE remember that prayer + action is always more powerful than prayer alone.,prayerandaction,156,26,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/i8cq0/my_3_year_old_nephew_died_this_week_from_domestic/,"A bit of a vent here - I created a new account for privacy reasons.  (Long time active redditor and a Christian.)


My younger brother married into a lovely family.  Fun, caring, goofy in a good way and deeply involved in the church.  Our extended families get together frequently and spend Thanksgiving together every year.  Their views are a bit more fundamentalist than my taste, but we all get along just fine...except for one area.


""J"", the middle daughter in their family, had a child out of wedlock with her college boyfriend.  She and her boyfriend were in the process of breaking up when she learned that she was pregnant.  The families were very supportive and glad that she decided to have the baby.  ""E"" was born just over three years ago and the ex-boyfriend continued to be part of E's life via a legal, structured visitation program.


A year ago, the ex-boyfriend married another woman who had two small kids herself.  At 2 years old, E was allowed to spend more time with the father's family under the agreement.  That's when problems started.  


E came home after one weekend with bruises.  The father explained that it was due to roughhousing and play, but the bruises seemed odd.  Then E came back from the next visit with more bruises - this time more severe.  J and her parents took pictures, documented what happened and went to Child Protective Services.  The CPS case agent told them that there was insufficient evidence for abuse.  Unless they could find more proof, there was nothing CPS could do.


**At this point, the family decided to turn to prayer for help.**  Prayer groups at church and prayer every time they sent E off for the weekend.  Some times he came back just fine - other times he was bruised.  E showed a bit of fear going away with his father's family. Each time, prayer groups would pray for his safety. When E came back bruised, they learned that the father would never see exactly what happened - it always occurred on the stepmother's watch.



My brother and I were concerned and he stepped in to talk with his wife's family about getting a lawyer involved.  Maybe bring in an investigator and definitely go up the ladder in CPS to get the problem resolved.  He was told (politely) that he had to have more faith in God, prayers and ""the system.""  My brother tried going through is wife with the same message, but she did not want to go against her parent's wishes.


On Sunday...this past Father's Day...the stepmother brought E to the emergency room.  E had a fractured skull, bruises around his neck, bruises on his back and he was missing a fingernail.  The EMT said that he had to revive E during the drive.  E was airlifted to a major hospital where he showed no brain activity.  This little 3-year-old was declared dead on Wednesday.  


Everything points towards the stepmother abusing E over the past year and, while the ex-boyfriend stepped away (?) on Father's Day, she beat this little 3-year-old to death.  The stepmother now has a ""no contact"" order for her own children and it is being treated as a murder investigation.  We don't know much more than that.  


My point in all of this?  **PLEASE DON'T MAKE PRAYER YOUR ONLY OPTION.**  Prayer has power.  I truly believe that prayer **and** action could have saved E's life.  J and her family did take action, but they quoted the following when the CPS agent concluded that there was insufficient evidence:


*""Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established.  The authorities that exist have been established by God.""  (Romans 13:1)*


Seriously - never fall back on prayer alone when you can also take action.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**EDIT:**  Just got off the phone with my brother. The stepmom wanted to attend the funeral (!) so someone checked in with Child Protection Services and the police investigator to stop her. CPS has her kids in their care and had been conducting physical / psychological tests.  They let slip that charges will be filed shortly and that the family shouldn't worry about her having the chance to show up.


Seriously glad this subreddit is here - thanks for letting me vent and for the kind words. (Christians and atheists all.)

I feel like I need to get something off my chest.

It bothers me  that Christians continually express shock, disapproval and judgment at the way non-Christians live.

You’ve seen it, and maybe even done it:
  Doesn’t anyone believe in marriage anymore?
  I can’t get over how many people today smoke weed.
  Can you believe they just sleep in instead of coming to church?
  Did you hear they moved in together? That’s so bad!
  What’s wrong with our government? Why don’t they uphold biblical  
  values?

Whenever I hear that, I I feel like saying “Do you seriously expect non-Christians to behave like Christians?”
 
Think it through.

Most people in the West no longer consider themselves Christian.
Or even if they use the term “Christian” to describe themselves, few believe in the authority of scripture or profess a personal faith in Jesus Christ.

So why would we expect them to behave like Christians? Why would we expect people who don’t profess to be Christians to:
  Wait until marriage to have sex?
  Clean up their language?
  Be celibate when they’re attracted to people of the same sex?
  Pass laws like the entire nation was Christian?

Seriously? Why? They’re not pretending to be Christians. Why would they adopt Christian values or morals?

Please don’t get me wrong. I’m a pastor. I completely believe that the Jesus is not only the Way, but that God’s way is the best way.

When you follow biblical teachings about how to live life, your life simply goes better. It just does. I 100% agree.

I do everything I personally can to align my life with the teachings of scripture, and I’m passionate about helping every follower of Christ do the same.

But what’s the logic behind judging people who don’t follow Jesus for behaving like people who don’t follow Jesus?

Why would you hold the world to the same standard you hold the church?
Before you judge a non-Christian for behaving like a non-Christian, think about this:

1. They act more consistently with their value system than you do. It’s difficult for a non-Christian to be a hypocrite, because they tend to live out what they believe. Chances are they are better at living out their values than you or I are. Jesus never blamed pagans for acting like pagans. But he did speak out against religious people for acting hypocritically.

2. Your disapproval is destroying the relationship (if you have even have a relationship in the first place). Some of the most judgmental Christians have zero non-Christians friends. Is that a surprise, really? I mean, on a human level,  how many people have you made time for this week that you know disapprove of who you are and the way you live? Exactly.

3. Judgment is a terrible evangelism strategy. People don’t line up to be judged. If you want to keep being ineffective at reaching unchurched people, keep judging them.

4. Judging outsiders is unChristian. Paul told us to stop judging people outside the church. Jesus said God will judge us by the same standard with which we judge others. Paul also reminds us to drop the uppity-attitude; that none of us were saved by the good we did but by grace.

So what can you do?

1.  Stop judging non-Christians. Start loving them. Very few people have been judged into life-change. Many have been loved into it.

2.  Empathize with non-Christians. Ask yourself, “If I wasn’t a Christian, what would I be doing?” Chances are you might be doing exactly what the non Christians in your neighbourhood are doing.  Understanding that and empathizing with that completely changes how you see people. And they can tell how you see them.

3. Hang out with non-Christians. Jesus did. And caught plenty of disapproval for it. I have a friend who continually drops f-bombs in my presence. As much as it bothers me, I never correct him (he’s not a kid, he’s my peer). But I do pray for him every day and we talk about my faith. I pray I see the day when he’s baptized.

4. Pray for unchurched people. It is impossible to remain enemies with someone you genuinely pray for daily.

5. Live out your faith authentically. Your actions carry weight. Humility is far more attractive than pride. When a non-Christian sees integrity, it’s compelling.

I just have a feeling if we in the church loved the world the way Jesus did, the world might come running to Christ.

In the past few days I've been thanked for moderating just right, vilified as a heavy-handed muscle-flexing thug and told I'm letting the sub go to ruin by not moderating enough.  It's like Goldilocks, but there is no 'just right'.

With that in mind, I'd like to explain a bit about why I do things the way I do.  Generally I and the other mods want to let moderation stay on the shoulders of the community, and only remove blatantly trolling posts or those blindingly in contravention of the [Community Policy](http://www.reddit.com/r/XtianityPolicy/comments/rzldx/community_policy_update_3282012/).  Downvotes are an effective method in most instances.

A major exception that I and other mods make is on prayer request threads and (often) advice threads - those where the OP is often going through a crisis of some sort, and which seem to invite much unhelpful commentary.  These are a call for help from the OP and as a moderator in this community, my duty is to help OP.  On these threads, I *will* be heavy-handed in removing posts that we see as not helping (or being explicitly harmful) to the OP, or posts seeking to start debate (it's not the time or place for debate, unless started by the OP). If the OP is discussing things w/ the poster that I think is crossing the line and appears unphased, I'll probably always leave the posts in.

If you do have a post removed, or feel a warning is unjust, please message modmail or one of us and we'll see about re-instating it or getting through the misunderstanding that led to the removal.

Humor/videos/etc - I'd love to see more humor on the board, but what is posted often gets instantly downvoted into oblivion (unless it's cat theology).  I'd like to suggest self-tagging of posts, w/ something like [Humor], [Music], [Meta], [Off-topic], etcetera.  From the small sample size that has done this, it seems to help forestall the reflexive downvotes while not misleading posters.

I steadfastly refused.  I am not a dog person, and neither is my cat Tiger.  In my opinion, dogs were smelly and unruly and an awful lot of work to train.  Well, in a word, my wife took advantage of my inability to say no when someone is in need.  A family friend needed to unload one of her three-year-old pups due to a nasty divorce.  There were no other prospective takers.

Slowly I began to get used to the idea of owning a dog.  A companion.  Man's best friend.  Happy to see you the moment you walk in the door.  From our decision to keep the dog till the date it was supposed to arrive - May 26 - we had a couple of months to wait.  By mid-May, I was rather looking forward to it.

Minutes after Millie was brought to our house, I got the text message - my grandfather had finally passed away.  I remembered the last time I saw him, telling him that morning that I loved him while Pet Sounds by the Beach Boys played softly in the background.  As the dog bounded back and forth in my yard, I couldn't help but feel a profound sense of loss.

I collapsed on my couch that evening, not desiring to do anything except to have a drink and fall asleep.  But someone else knew what I needed.  The comfort and companionship of a friend I never thought I'd want, one who arrived in the perfect timing of a loving God... [just when I needed her](http://i.imgur.com/YX1gd.jpg).
