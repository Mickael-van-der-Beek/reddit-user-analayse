1375280742.0,875,self.Eve,1jf7m9,"New player ""which race to choose"" advice. (don't upvote)",arkhammer,1195,320,152,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1jf7m9/new_player_which_race_to_choose_advice_dont_upvote/,"I wrote this up for a friend, then realized midway through that it'd probably be pretty helpful for all newbies.  Remember that the racial choice is **purely cosmetic**, since all races can be cross-trained (the starting skills only take about a day to cross-train).  However, the race you start with is a good path to go down initially, and here's some helpful advice of what makes the races unique (not really going into lore) and how they all work:

* The **Amarr** prefer bricky, heavily tanked armor platforms firing lasers primarily, some ships using drones (sort of like Eve's version of a pet), and in their more advanced ships even using missiles (missiles aren't really as prevalent here as they would be on say a Caldari or Minmatar ship).  Lasers take crystals for ammo and they last forever or, for some of the advanced crystal ammo, a very long time but eventually break and have to be replaced; missiles don't really require any tracking or anything like that to hit their target, as long as the target is in range.  Drones are a weapon system where you launch up to 5 drones and they go out and orbit and attack your target.  Lasers require a lot of the ship's capacitor to fire, while missiles don't take any.  Armor tanking is very strong passively, meaning that it can get a lot of ""buffer"" (a large pool of hitpoints) with strong passive resistances to damage, but once you deplete the armor (without a logistic ship there to repair you back up), it's gone.  Their preferred form of electronic warfare is to disrupt their enemy's turrets tracking speeds, and they also have a few ships that have specialized bonuses to drain the enemy's capacitor, as well.  Tanky laserbricks.  That's Amarr.  Oh, and their ships are pretty.

* The **Caldari**, on the other had, prefer relatively slow (compared to the other shield race, the Minmatar) shield ships that fire missiles and hybrid weapons.  Missiles, missiles, missles = Caldari.  They love 'em.  They also have several hybrid (a type of weapon system) ships that can fire out bullets to extremely long ranges.  Hybrids require the ships capacitor to fire, though not as much as an Amarr laser. The Caldari are the least favorable drone race (that title belongs to the Gallente and to a lesser extent the Amarr) but they love their missiles.  Several of their shield ships have bonuses to the shield resistances to damage, similar to Amarr with their armor resistances, but unlike armor, shields regenerate slowly over time.  Their preferred form of electronic warfare is to use Electronic Countermeasures (ECM) to jam out the enemy's ship so it can't lock any targets!  Their ships are beautiful in the eye of the beholder, although many find their asymmetry appealing.  Long range, missile spewing monsters.  That's Caldari.

* Next, the **Gallente** are an in-your-face, close range-loving race that chooses hybrid weapons (primarily blasters) and have an affinity for drones.  The Gallente used to be *the* drone race, although in recent times the Amarr have received several ships with bonuses to them as well.  The Gallente, however, still hang on to the crown, despite the Amarr's newfound interest in drones.  The Gallente have a love of really high damage, and their ships can typically dish out the most, as long as you can get their close-range (indeed, point-blank) blasters to bear on the target.  Gallente ships prefer armor tanking, but unlike Amarr, their ships do not receive bonuses to the damage resistance.  They instead receive bonuses to the ships active armor repair modules.  So, a Gallente ship can repair its armor faster than any other race when using active armor repair modules, which require the ship's capacitor to use.  And although fitting an armor tank typically makes a ship slower, the Gallente have strong innate agility and speed, so their ships remain relatively quick when fitting down with heavy armor.  They prefer remote sensor dampening for their electronic warfare, greatly reducing an enemy ship's time to lock or target locking range.  Gallentean ships have an organic quality to them, with some people finding their organic nature ugly and some finding it beautiful.  Up-close, high damage dealing brawlers.  That's Gallente.

* Lastly, the **Minmatar** are the undisputed fastest race in the game.  They prefer shield tanking and speed, and their ships are among the fastest in New Eden.  To achieve this speed, the Minmatar mostly use shield tanking, which doesn't slow the ship down as armor would, although a few of their ships can fit good armor tanks.  They prefer an active shield tank, and their ships have bonuses to the shield repair amount when using active shield restoration modules.  Though these modules take capacitor to use, Minmatar weapons do not.  They prefer using projectile weapons, which are like modern day firearms, and they also have ships that have bonuses to missiles.  The Minmatar use target painting for their electronic warfare, which inflates the enemy ship's signature to make it easier to hit.  Minmatar quickly get into the fray, and they are masters at kiting their opponent around while their projectiles whittle away at the enemy's defenses.  Their rust-colored ships have a ""thrown-together,"" high utility look.  But if you're looking for speed, Minmatar is it.  Highly agile, high speed and deadly.  That's Minmatar.

Apologies in advance for the incoming wall of text. Thank you for reading if you make your way through it; I'm loving this game and I just wanted to share some of my experiences over the last couple of days, from the perspective of someone who is *totally* brand new to EVE Online.

**Saturday**

---

I read a news story about how EVE is getting a new expansion on June 4th. 19 expansions; that's cool. Idly, I wonder if Reddit has an EVE subreddit. Of course it does.

EVE had always been interesting to me. I'd sworn off pay-to-play MMOs ever since I had multiple accounts and lost 18 months to EverQuest, back in the day. But, I love space games like Elite and Freelancer. I love the news stories on gaming sites about EVE and the player-driven economy, and the massive wars. I installed a trial a couple of years ago, but it crashed my laptop within minutes, so I left it alone and outside the news stories, I know nothing.

I look at the subreddit. I don't understand a lot of it; too much jargon. I see the sidebar. 21 day buddy trial? I have a new laptop nowadays. Maybe it'll run. Sure. Why not?


I create an account from the link. I install and log in.

I create a character. I laugh and call my wife over to show her how amazing the character customization is, how you can move facial features and things around without sliders...just by dragging in the main window. How my character's hair has physics. How realistic the eyes look. We both wonder aloud about why RPGs like Skyrim don't have characters that look this good.

I don't research the races. I create a free spirited young woman, a descendant of miners who will initially follow in her parent's footsteps then perhaps develop wanderlust, and decide instead to explore the stars. Free spirited and independent? I choose Gallente, and spend more than an hour tweaking her looks. Her name is Lei Harper.


I begin.

The user interface is...busy. So much information! I'm paralyzed for a moment. There's a tutorial. I follow it. I get a Velator. It is asymmetrical and I don't like that. I check on Google and realize with a little horror that by choosing Gallente, I've committed myself to a bunch of asymmetrical ships. No big deal I guess.

I learn to fly. I learn basic navigation. I learn what a capsule is, how to dock, how to warp. I go to the career funnels.

I'm already tired of my Velator. I look on the wikis while I fly for a potential ship. I find a boxy, worn, yellow frigate that is built for mining. She has an ore hold that almost seems ridiculously oversized. She is a Venture. She is perfect.

I can get her from a career funnel mission. Early. For free. Even better. I start the Industry path. I deliver stuff. I get my Venture. I admire her and her no-frills, industrial looks. I like the cool running lights. I name her ""Rising Star"".

I get more missions and I learn to mine. Mining, I discover, is slow. I also learn about skills. I find the concept of them training in real time to be fascinating and very different to any other game out there. I start pushing all my skill efforts into increasing my mining yields. I make more than half a million ISK. To me, this seems like a fortune. I look on the Market for ship fittings. Its not a fortune. Not in the slightest.

I call it a night.

---

**Sunday**

---


I an excited and energized about my new game. Saturday was great and there are so many things I want to do today!

The servers are under DDOS attack. EVE is down. EVE is down all day. I read the wikis and check twitter feeds. It doesn't come back. Twitter users laugh about addicted nerds having to do something else today.

I'm annoyed, and I haven't even had the game for 24 hours at this point.

---

**Monday**

---


I resume. I add some military missions to spice things up. I earn an Atron. It is also asymmetrical, but it has more guns than my Venture, and is much more nimble. I name her ""Swiftwind"" and figure out what constitutes a good Blaster on the Market. I equip Neutron Blasters and start tearing up Serpentis rats in my missions. I'm having fun.


But I need more money. And I'm at the point in the Industry track where I have a blueprint and I need to build a frigate to complete the mission. It uses minerals that I've never even seen before, certainly not when I'm mining Veldspar, Scordite or Plagioclase.

I look at the wiki. Jaspet. I need Jaspet. Where the heck do I find it?

In Gallente space, anywhere with a security level of 0.4 or lower. What's a security level?

I read, but I don't truly understand.


I plan my trip. I find a 0.4 system close to my home system and autopilot there. My Venture, I know now, was a shitfit. I had no skills, no preparation. When I get to the final Stargate, I get a popup. And that's when I actually get my first twinge of trepidation. ""Are you sure you want to do this?"" the popup asks. ""CONCORD cannot guarantee your safety.""

I want that Jaspet. So I jump. On the other side, I see a system...like any other. Cool, this looks OK. Hey look, asteroid belts. I set a course and warp. I come out of warp practically on top of an asteroid. Pristine Jaspet. Awesome! How lucky am I? I start mining and deploy my shiny new mining drones. This is going to be great.

My Mining laser is terribly slow on this rarer ore. This is going to take a while and I don't really want to hang around here. How much Jaspet do I need to do a refining run? I alt-tab and look at the wiki. I look it up, along with a couple of other things. I spend probably 45 seconds away from the EVE client. I need 500 Jaspet. OK. I alt-tab back.

There is a jet black, claw of a ship sitting right in front of my Venture. I see the brackets. Open brackets, not a cross. This was a player. This was PvP. I was engaged in PVP, and I was looking at Firefox.

My blood runs cold. This does not often happen when I'm playing a video game. I freeze, petrified. There was a timer ticking down on my HUD. I can't even read it. I am still mining. The guy is sitting there, not 200m off my bow and I just think...Damn...he must think I'm an idiot. He's getting ready to slaughter me and I'm just mining without a care in the world. I try to spring into action. I fumble...I stop mining. I recall my drones. I scroll frantically through my overview looking for the stargate. Why is it full of damn asteroids!?

My warp drive won't work.

I try to run but its like my ship is flying through molasses.

I steel myself. I would have to fight. Maybe my tier 1 neutron blaster will be strong enough...

I can't get a target lock.

I panic. I am utterly helpless. Weapon fire streaks towards my Venture from offscreen...there was MORE THAN ONE OF THEM?! and before I can even react, shields, armor and hull are stripped red and my screen erupts in a fireball. My capsule hangs in the void and for a moment I just wait, unsure of what to do. Then the weapons strike again and I am unceremoniously dumped back into a station.


I stare blankly at the screen. Emails begin to arrive. Insurance payout. CONCORD sending me kill rights to my attackers. An email from myself about my death, and my medical clone.

I start to pick up the pieces. I realize that my insurance only covered my ship, not my fittings. My ore was gone. I have practically nothing in my wallet except the money from my policy. They give me another Velator. I evaluate what had happened in my mind. I remember words from the wikis and forums. There were words for this, I think.

Ganked. And...Podded? Yeah. That's the words.


I realize I am playing a game where death has consequences, and they can be severe. There is no corpse retrieval, no resurrection. I can't even imagine traveling back to the wreck of my ship. I look up my murderers online. Basgerin Pirates. Their descriptions are full of profanity and threats of death. A billion ISK ransom and they'll walk away and leave you alone. A billion ISK. They've been playing for years, and I've been playing for a day. What was I thinking?

I buy the minerals I need from the market with my remaining cash. I finish the Industry track. I do a couple more missions on the military side but I don't have the heart for it. My Rising Star is gone. 

Just before I quit for the day, I check my wallet and I'm one million ISK richer. Stunned, I check my journal and see that a player donated a million ISK to me. I don't remember their exact name, it was something philanthropist related so I guess they were giving away free stuff. I send them EVEmail and thank them profusely, explaining that I just lost my main ship in low security space and this million ISK will help me get back on my feet. They welcome me to New Eden and tell me that I've learned an important lesson - Never go to lowsec unprepared. I buy a new Venture and name her ""Rising Star II"". Next time will be better. I call it a night.

**Tuesday**

---


I finish the Military career track and get awarded a Tristan frigate. Its has symmetry and I like its star shape, and I see with glee that it has a large drone hold. I'm training drones now and I'm really starting to like them, so a small drone-boat like this is just what I need. I fit it with Hobgoblins and Prototype Gauss Cannons. The long range guns are awesome. The drones are awesome. I tear up Serpentis punks like their ships are beer cans. I am invincible. I have a crazy thought that I want to fit this Tristan with top-of-the-line fittings, and go hunt PVP pirates with it. I name her ""Vengeance"".


Odyssey was released today so I tool around with the new sensor sweep and things. I need to complete a third career track since I decided I wanted to apply to join EVE University, and they state you have to have completed at least three of the career funnel tracks to apply. I've already done Industry and Military, so I do the Exploration track to see the new Odyssey mechanics and meet EVE University's requirements. It only takes me a couple of hours to complete the track and takes me through hacking data sites, relics and gas sites, as well as how to use probes.

I notice some kind of Serpentis hideways keep showing up on my probe scans so when I'm done with the Exploration track, I decide to investigate. I'm flying Vengeance, my invincible Tristan as my exploration ship so I'm confident that I can tear up some more Serpentis like usual.

I probe and scan down some kind of Serpentis hideout, hit it up with a right click and do what I usually do. Warp to 0.

Space blurs, my Tristan surges ahead and comes screaming out of warp at the waypoint...into a cloud of red contacts. Red everywhere. Ships, sentry guns. I'm lit up like its July 4th and my Tristan explodes before it can even turn to warp the hell out of there. I limp back home in my capsule. I am not invincible. Another setback.


I get back to base and check my wallet. Seems lower than I thought. No insurance email. I forgot to insure my Tristan. Shit.

I go back to highsec mining. I have a spot in a 0.8 system that has been very good to me, so I spend all my money on Tech 2 Mining lasers and start grinding ore for money. My mining yield is damn good; I'm pulling thousands of Scordite or Veldspar per cycle in the Venture. I continue my training in Refining to get better reprocessing on my ore. Mostly as I'm mining, I want to learn more. I spend more time on the wiki than I do looking at my ships. I learn jargon so I can understand better. I learn strategies. I learn what NOT to do. I learn how to fit, how to travel, what to look for in lowsec.

I learn what a Cyno is, I learn about Nos, Neuts, Scrambles. I read forums and I'm both horrified and amused by some of the shit that people do in this game, so I also learn terms like Safari and AWOXing. I finally understand why people write o7 all the time.


Before I quit for the night, I decide that I want that Jaspet again. I don't need the minerals that much, but I want it. But, I'm terrified that I'm not ready. I've been researching tactics. I want ECM or ECM drones, but I don't have the skills or the time to train them. A cloaking device is totally out of the question right now. So, I learn some level 1 skills and fit as best I can. I fit the Venture with the two Tech 2 mining lasers and one mining drone. Plus, one combat drone in case I need to kill a shitty rat. I fit a shield battery, a shield regenerator and some more capacitor since I've had it run out before when activating both my lasers and I don't want to get caught with no cap. I note that the Venture comes prefitted with 2 points to negate Warp Scrambling, so I add a third point and hope that will be enough to get me out of trouble.

I return to Besgerin. I read the CONCORD warning before jumping and this time, I feel actual fear. I try to relax. I can do this. I jump.


The gate is clear. I apply what I've learned an immediately move to a point off away from the gate, away from the asteroids I'm eventually going to. I travel to the belt at range, I scan and check for hostiles. I identify my rock (Pristine Jaspet again) and immediately align to my escape vector before I do anything else. I mine.

My palms are sweating. My mouth is dry. There are others here in Local and I assume they want to find me, and kill me.

I am focused like a laser. I check local. I check my Overview, which is cut to the bone on filters for PVP traffic. I have my escape route already set. I recheck alignment. I cycle through probable attack vectors for hostiles and scan with directional scanner. I realize that I haven't launched my mining drones. Stupid. I check my yield and the cycle time on my mining lasers. One more cycle. My drone is out and as my last cycle finishes it brings me up to exactly 1500 Pristine Jaspet. Three refining loads. I decide to let it keep running, and then I see the brackets.

I barely even registered there was something there. I hit Warp and heard the warning chime of a lock as the drive spooled up. No scramble. I was locked and a burst of fire took 5% of my shield as I warped away. I emerged on top of the stargate and was out of the system in seconds. 

I celebrated. I refined. I made solid ISK. I called it a night.


If I didn't have a laptop on my lap I would have been on my feet punching the air. The adrenaline rush was amazing, better than any game I can think of in recent memory. My subscription is virtually guaranteed at this point. This is just...awesome.


**tl;dr** EVE is awesome, and even someone who knows nothing can learn enough to play in a couple of days, even if they have to get chewed up and spat out a couple of times in the process.

**Consolidated Update: Oh my goodness, thank you all for the kind words and the Reddit gold. And for the messages, the gifts, and the billions of ISK! Its been overwhelming!**

Hi. I'm Raem Civrie, and I played this stupid game for years and years. I saw some shit in my capacity as Chronic Close Observer of Big Events, and hereby do my best to illustrate some of it for later arrivals. Dates are fuzzy, and some facts may be as well, because this is from memory and my memory is the worst thing.

--

Back in 2000, I was 14 years old and a little tit, an attribute that I would stubbornly hold on to for way too long. But 2000 was also the year I learned about EVE-Online, then three years away from release and little else than a barebones website, some forums, an IRC channel and fevered promises by a bunch of crazy people in a cramped office.

Oddly enough, the first corporation ""founded"" in EVE was back then, somewhere around October/November 2000 named ""North Star Industries"", and by virtue of being first in through the door I would end up being a part of the Triumvirate ""leading"" some 50 people waiting for a game whose eventual existence was anyone's guess. It was the first of many meaningless titles I would cherish down the road. I'd later ""found"" an espionage-focused corporation called Horizon Industries. Of course, this was all the most vacuous roleplay you can imagine, characterized by play-fights on the forums and endless competing for the ""coolest"" signature images and websites. But I was a bored teenager and I didn't have anything better to do.

Alpha rolled in, and being a little tit I weaseled my way into it. There's not much to remember from those days except that unless you brought your ship to a dead stop before initiating warp, the momentum would do hilarious things to your course. A velocity of 1m/s could mean going off course by some few hundred thousand kilometers from your intended target. Also, there was no autopilot, and no star map. People *sold* maps, because without those little hand-drawn reference guides you could easily end up in the arse end of nowhere. It was fun.

Closed Beta, then Open Beta rolled through, and the shape of things to come reared it's ugly head. By then TAOSP, or ""The Armada of Shin's Pants"" had migrated from Homeworld to the EVE Beta, later becoming the infamous corporation ""Evolution"" post-release and founding Band of Brothers, the eternal Goony foe (who did not exist as an entity for another few years after release). I joined Evolution for a spell, largely by way of having been around for fucking ever even back in 2003, but I was still a little tit so the little tit went the little tit's way. I still got to participate in the first Venal War and the first Curse War, which was cool.

The thing is, at launch there was no cohesion to the political reality of EVE. Fountain was largely ruled by disparate, warring pirates and privateers until Evolution moved in, cleaned house and established the Fountain Alliance. In Venal, a similar development occurred when Taggart Transdimensional rolled into town and established a pseudo-democracy in the Venal Alliance. Down south-east, Curse was still struggling with birthing any superpowers, since displaced pirates from the north and the west had largely moved there to do their thing. The Curse Alliance (which I had been a member of prior to joining Evolution) was doing their best, and my corporation (Endless Corp. [TEC]) had a **Whole Battleship** (egads). I still remember the sting of losing my prized Vexor cruiser when M0O (Masters of Ownage) crashed a mining operation there. M0O had previously gained notoriety by completely fucking shutting down the Mara-Passari corridor, which back then was the primary connection between The Citadel and The Forge. CCP actually mobilized an event team masquerading as CONCORD and assaulted the pirates, and had their cheat-y CONCORD battleships equipped with cheat-y modules *whipped* by Amarr cruisers stacking damage mods and projectile turrets. It was hilarious.

But underlying that was the transformation of EVE, previously occupied by disorganized Warlords acting on the strength of their respective corporations, then conquered by stronger entities that coalesced into the first Alliances that would, and could, exert influence across entire regions.

Meanwhile, I left Evolution on less-than-awesome terms, which I'll omit from here as it paints me in quite the bad light and there's enough of that in here already.

Some aimless wandering later, I was contacted by an old beta friend Pallantre about him and his buddy, HellGremlin, setting up a mercenary/murder company called Black Monkey. It was fun shit, right from the start. Someone would identify and infiltrate ""soft"" targets, generally high-sec industrial corps comprised of newbies, and then the rest of us would barrel down in a swarm of Incursus frigates and absolutely ruin them by strength of knowing somewhat what we were doing. After a while of doing this, HellGremlin (now using the character Istvaan Shogaatsu) felt the need to flex his narrative wings, and The Guiding Hand Social Club was created.

We slowly started to make a name for ourselves in high-sec lanes, such as it was, trashing a succession of innocent corporations for our own enrichment and amusement. But more importantly, there was a new purpose to the whole thing, because GHSC was from the get-go a roleplaying corporation. Istvaan was fairly prolific in writing short stories and fleshing out the background and aesthetic of the Club, and some of us others got swept up in it as well, dumping our awful fanfiction onto the forums. At least five official chronicles were penned by GHSC members, as well, including my own ""Stairway to Heaven"".

BodyCount Inc. was starting up at the time (later founding the Mercenary Coalition, or MC) and we enjoyed a mixture of rivalry and professional admiration on both sides. While BDCI was always more of a heavy-hitter, our operatives had long since perfected the art of infiltration and mind games inside target corporations. Hell, some of our escapades were actually *paid* contracts, too, a rarity back in the day. As an amusing aside, Istvaan Shogaatsu had been a member of Something Awful forums, and helped set up the first Goon corporation in EVE, with the secret intent of using them as pawns in whatever the hell we felt like at the time. This was unfortunately spoiled by one of our own letting the whole thing slip in a conversation with one of the members, Istvaan got banned from SA and we ended up killing off like 3 of the first Goonfleet incarnations. GHSC corporate offices still contain Remedial's corpses, somewhere. We used to collect them.

Somewhere between contracts, I also got my start and end in the single most enjoyable adventure I ever had in EVE. To explain; T2 was still a relative novelty, having been introduced with the Castor expansion. Also, 0.0 alliances were entirely based in NPC stations, since player-owned structures had not been introduced at that point (except for Conquerable Stations, which were unreliable at best and a joke at worst). As such, trade was *explicitly* banned in almost every Alliance station, because of the possibility that raiding hostiles might stock up and rearm in their very own strongholds. Needless to say, warfare was 98% camping people in stations. I, however, somehow got the idea of smuggling contraband T2 modules into these stations, and with that in mind managed to acquire a unique ""license"" to travel (but not sell) through Fountain Alliance space from it's incumbent president (again, Beta connections). And holy shit it was awesome.

My first run was financed entirely through loans; I borrowed some 150 million ISK from a friend (a large sum back then), loaded as much T2 as I could into a fucking *kestrel frigate*, and set off down the long road from Nonni to YZ-LQL. Depending on the modules, I more than doubled my investment, allowing me to both pay back the loan *and* finance another run. On the way back, I'd carry best-in-slot armor repair modules (T2 armor reps hadn't been introduced yet, or were just awful. I forget which) back to Empire and sell that there. It was like I had stumbled onto my own fucking goldmine and I was giggling the whole time. Of course, I was still at the mercy of pirates, roving warbands and whoever felt like taking potshots at the stupid Kestrel I was flying, and since I was in the habit of investing my entire fortune at any time into any single run, I managed to lose everything like two or three times. It didn't matter; I'd just take another loan, and do it all over again. And then Evolution fucking went to war with FA, and killed my golden goose. The other major alliances were closed to me, and I was less than happy about this development. My smuggling days were over as suddenly as they had begun.

A guy named DigitalCommunist had joined the Guiding Hand Social Club some time previous with a character named Arenis Xemdal. Arenis later ""left"" to join Ubiqua Seraph, founders and leaders of the Aegis Militia, an Amarrian RP alliance. He quickly became their most valued pilot, leading sorties and fleets against their hated Minmatar enemies, whose fleets were coincidentally often led by another GHSC member, Hamish (secretly Tyrrax Thorrk). Some months later, [this whole thing happened](http://eve.klaki.net/heist/). The codeword ""Nicole"" was uttered, Uuve Savisaalo webbed and scrambled the target, and Arenis Xemdal performed the execution in his priceless Imperial Apocalypse while strategically placed operatives simultaneously robbed every corporate outpost they could.

And for us in GHSC, the whole world seemed to fucking explode.

Istvaan seized the moment masterfully, expertly telling a tale of deep corporate intrigue with all due embellishment, in co-operation with DigitalCommunist. Interviews rolled in, from PCGamer to New Scientist to BBC. According to CCP, there was a sudden spike in new subscriptions. More than once I'd stop and ask myself what the fuck was happening, and then re-affirming my vow to never, ever piss off DigitalCommunist. Ever. Seriously.

This was aided by our previous efforts in establishing a backstory, flair and theme for the Guiding Hand, because people ate it up. The idea of a secretive (HAH!) collective of sociopathic manipulators pulling the strings behind the scenes, plotting the rise and fall of Empires, well, it was a lovely fantasy. It was so lovely that many became willing partners in creating and maintaining it, even if it just meant recognizing the chilling reminder that infiltrators were a very real threat to any EVE corporation. Suddenly EVE was both more fantastical and real than anyone had henceforth imagined.

We did some shit after that, but the effort and timespan that went into the Great Heist wasn't matched until later, when Tyrrax asked me if I wanted to join him and ""some newbies"" in a new corporation called Umbra Congregatio [UMCON]. It wasn't much at first; we had joined some deadbeat alliance in the ass-end of Catch called Manticore or something, except Umcon was actually working with another alliance called Interstellar Alcohol Conglomerate [IAC] with the intent of removing Manticore and allowing IAC to expand into the area proper. Which we did, and IAC followed.

Now, there's a lot of fucking history here, but I'll try to condense shit;

ISS had a station nearby, the ISS Marginis, the *first* open trade port in EVE, one of the first player stations built in EVE (like, third, or something), funded entirely through an IPO and protected by virtue of most all neighbouring powerhouses owning a share in the whole enterprise such as CA and Lotka Volterra. Now, IAC had it's own station at that point, and was close to erecting a new one. In fact, *right after* that second station was erected, MC suddenly appeared and put our first station into lockdown. MC outnumbered us, outgunned us and outplanned us, but thanks to that new station 3 jumps away we had an available rally point, and thanks to a timely intervention from the Goons (R.I.P VileRat), we held. Somehow, we fucking held, mostly by crashing the node repeatedly through record fleet turnouts. Them were heady days, our little alliance beset by a faceless puppetmaster with the finances to hire one of the most powerful alliances in the game to wipe us out, and we held.

Problem was that accusations of MC staging their initial assaults from the ISS Marginis quickly turned into a diplomatic dispute between ISS and IAC. IAC allying itself with a group of pirates that liked to raid ISS space didn't help, but those pirates had helped us during the invasion while ISS had seemingly hosted the invading forces.

Coinciding with this, there was an Alliance Tournament. Representing IAC was Tyrrax Thorrk, me, and a few others lovely blokes. Tyrrax fielded his Imperial Apocalypse, of which three remained in total, with me as the pilot. Then it died, on live broadcast. Shortly after, I arrived at the studio as a guest commentator (I will never willingly go on TV again) for later games, and had the privilege of announcing IAC's war declaration on the ISS after receiving a text message from Tyrrax while on air.

The world exploded a second time. Lotka Volterra was mobilized, along with the MC to assist ISS. Goonswarm again came to our aid, and even managed to convince aAa to join us (goddamnit, VileRat, you beautiful bastard. I miss you already). That was the start of the Great Southern War. It didn't end until the Goons disbanded BoB, and even then, I don't know.

1359572113.0,469,self.Eve,17kqr3,"Today, I had my first true EVE moment. A new player's story. (long)",Suecotero,527,58,259,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/17kqr3/today_i_had_my_first_true_eve_moment_a_new/,"So I picked up EVE last week, once again determined to find that sandbox magic that we had all read about but that seems miles of spreadsheets and obscure terms away when you undock for that first time. I had from previous trials already determined that missions were too much kill-10-rats-in-space for me and mining... well, mining made NPC missions look like dynamic wonders of emergent gameplay. Still, I didn't want to jump headlong into PvP without at least some money-making skills behind me, so I chose exploration. 

Now exploration is tough at first because scanning isn't easy to learn or very fast for a new character, and many sites are often not the ones you are looking for, and even when you do find the correct site they sometimes have little of value. And then you hit the jackpot. I tripled my net worth twice, first with a 6 and then a 24 million find and from there on I was hooked.

Later, I had this idea that if I was finding all of this stuff close to Jita, space treasure would be even better in some dead-end, god-forsaken lowsec backwater where even the pirates got bored. I bought my first industrial hauler and packed it full of exploration frigates, combat frigates, drones, hotdogs and other essentials for an interstellar camping trip. Having no idea about the political geography of eve, I dove into the fractal maze of stars until I found a chain of systems that looked suitably abandoned, and set the autopilot on my lumbering space-truck.

True enough, my first day of prospecting netted a 44m site. As I excitedly analyzed the broken ships and bagged the cargo, Mr. Pirate warps in. Mr. Pirate is in [this](http://images2.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090915064606/eve/images/b/b3/Harbinger512.jpg), I am in [this.] (http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/w/images/thumb/f/f6/Imicus.jpg/256px-Imicus.jpg) I proceed to shit myself and freeze up remembering all those articles about the unforgiving universe of EVE. I had greedily ventured into lowsec and now I was going to pay the prize, was my thinking as the first salvo blew off half my shields. The jolt must have shocked me into action because I decided to make a run for it, aimed for the opposite side and turned on my afterburner, praying for the next shot to miss. Now it's true that as a new player, you don't stand a chance against a 100m ship that takes weeks to learn how to fly. But Battlecruisers, as I discovered, are slow. 

Soon I was outside of warp scrambler range and hauling ass to my depo giggling like a madman. I had been so close to losing the biggest catch of my EVE life, yet I had survived! I was a survivor! Mr. Pirate struck up a conversation on chat and congratulated me on my getaway. Turns out he frequented the same area both exploring and taking shots of opportunity. Now Mr. Pirate was very friendly, even helping me clear out some tough sites in lowsec without blowing me up, a risk I was acknowledging when I asked him to fleet with me.

Today, my new frenemy had found 4 juicy magnetometric sites in a system, but had not equipped the scientific equipment to scan them, so he asked me to join him, scavenging the sites while he fought off their defenders. After one hour I had gathered 15m in salvage and some tier 2 blueprints worth a total of 100m for some rather easy work. My new buddy warps off to station to ""reload his shields"" and when he comes back I ask him how he wants to split. His response comes as his ship locks on to mine and scrambles my warp drive. 

""*Let this be a lesson: Hand over the blueprints and you'll get away unharmed.*""

This brought me some pause. This time he was only a few thousand meters away from me and I was flying a much bigger and slower [Vexor](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/w/images/thumb/d/d9/Vexor.jpg/256px-Vexor.jpg). Not having experienced much PvP I had no idea what my chances of survival were. If he had fitted a short-range warp scrambler my microwarp drive was dead and I was stuck. If he had fitted a long-range warp disruptor I had a chance to get out of range of his larger and (hopefully) slower ship before his lasers tore me apart.

Trapped, I made the only rational decision: Ignorant of my chances of escape, I had to assume they were 50/50. My ship was worth some 10m. My cargo was worth a 100. I was going to make a run for it. I engaged the microwarp drive and felt a surge of adrenaline as my ship started accelerating. I was still within disruptor range, but I was gaining distance fast and wasn't taking any hits. I had the luck to be sitting exactly between him and a distant space station, so all I had to do was roar ahead until I exited his 24-km jamming distance and I was free. Still no hits, I had no idea if he had utterly not expected me to run or if he was actually firing but missing. The little icon at the bottom of my HUD faded, and I warped. Free! Free with a more money in my cargo hold than I had in my bank account, all of it snatched from the claws of death!

I am hooked.

1370391767.0,467,self.Eve,1fost6,CCP Mint Chip is the piss in the punchbowl,wonton_soupidity,676,209,607,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1fost6/ccp_mint_chip_is_the_piss_in_the_punchbowl/,"I keep hearing the argument (strawman) that anyone who doesn't approve of CCP Mint Chip only feel that way because she is female. Aside from the fact that this is a cheap debate tactic and strawman argument, EVE players have embraced every other existing female staff member. Why?

Maybe it has to do with them being **hired based on their experience, positive attitude and experience with the community.**

Maybe it has to do with them having a [proven record](http://www.eve-search.com/thread/51721-1/page/all) of dealing with the community in a **positive way, on its own terms, in accordance with the community standards that have existed since the game began.**

The simple answer is that CCP Mint Chip is coming VERY late to the party and is riding solely on her point-of-view as an EVE outsider, throwing her YouTube begging as a basis for ""social experience"" into the ring and demanding respect because it is ""expected"" or ""politically correct"" to welcome her with open arms simply because she is female.

This is not the way reality works, this is not the way EVE works, this is not the way our community works. If the community doesn't think you're qualified *then you probably aren't.* Being qualified to be CCP staff involves having previous gaming experience and a **noted positive track record** in dealing with the EVE community. CCP Mint Chip lacks this.

Her frequent [insulting of EVE players and the game itself](http://i.imgur.com/BPjx57Y.png), constant ragequits and all-too-often resorting to drama-whoring as a means to gain attention (YouTube views) should write her off from ever holding any position at CCP. Instead she wipes her accounts of any inflammatory remarks and uses her YT channel views as social experience on her resume. She gets hired in a second, likely because CCP wants to use her as bait for the Dust console fanboys. (Prove me wrong. Please. No, seriously. I'd really like to be proven wrong, here.)

If CCP Mint Chip were male and had a publicly documented history of trashing our game and our community, posting dick-pics and making tearful rage videos every time he lost a Loki it would be a huge issue. Why should we censor ourselves simply because she is female and might get her feelings hurt? This smacks of hypocrisy and a double-standard. I thought female gamers wanted to shed this view of being delicate flowers that need hand-holding? Why would CCP Mint Chip use this as a defense (and embrace it as though it were a virtue) from any who would rightly question her qualifications? 

Every other female staff member and every good female EVE pilot I have ever known have been what I would call ""bros."" That is, being cool, chill, and generally not wearing their genders on their sleeves and using it as a shield when times get tough. A ""bro"" is not limited to males. If you truly are a gamer and worthy of a staff position it wouldn't matter to you. The fact that CCP Mint Chip touts herself as a GRRL GAMER only points to her need to incite drama which revolves around her gender, hiding behind it when the argument she's incited get out of her control.

If anyone is wondering about the nature behind the public outrage, consider for a moment a group of tabletop gamers. They go to the same place, they do the same things, they nerd-out about the things they like to nerd-out about. It is their haven, their refuge where they can engage in and talk about all the nerdy stuff nobody else likes to hear about. Their money supports the nerd-lair, keeps it operating and running smoothly. They put in their ideas about how best to keep it going so their precious nerd-lair doesnt disappear. This is THEIR community. They feel safe here.

Now imagine this lanky, bleach-blonde girl in her A&amp;F cutoffs, Prada bag and oversized sunglasses standing near the door, insulting anyone who walks into the nerd-lair, calling them ""losers"", ""nerds"", ""neckbears"", ""virgins"" and ""basement-dwellers"" while spinning the keychain to her Audi. Any time someone tells her to grow up and go away gets a flurry of insults like ""mysoginist"" or ""hater"", while she calls all her girlfriends to show up and point and laugh at the nerds. 

Now imagine that every few days this girl walks into the nerd-lair and asks in her most faux cutesy-cutesy voice if someone can buy her a new pair of shoes that she **REALLY** wants.

When this post is about 48 hours old, I'll generate a ticket list and post it here, along with a dice link from Chribba's Dice tool. After another hour or so, I'll unlock the dice and draw **~~three~~ five** winners to receive a PLEX apiece.

 * Your Reddit account must be at least 7 days old to win.

1371142034.0,364,self.Eve,1g9zt9,A Story About Mining Bots (and a lesson on how to identify them),CMIV,427,63,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1g9zt9/a_story_about_mining_bots_and_a_lesson_on_how_to/,"It all started when I was using an alt to get info on some war targets on a high-sec / low-sec border. I noticed some odd behavior from a retriever in the high-sec system. It was constantly warping between belts and seemingly doing nothing else for around 30 minutes. There were only 5 belts in system. Could be a very drunk / stoned player I guess...

**BE NICE, BE SOCIABLE**

I asked in local how he was doing. No response. I asked him if he needed a hand finding some 'roids. No response. I tried to convo him, but it was rejected instantly every time. So, I added him as a contact and continued on my way. A week or 2 later, I was no longer in any wars, my sec status let me into high-sec and I'd finished my null-sec project. I decided to spend some quality time with high-sec for a while. I'd start by trying to help out that poor stoned retriever pilot. 

**GOT HISTORY? GET INTEL.**

He was only 4 weeks old, but he was in a corp. That's nice I thought, noobs need to get involved in a corp early in their EvE career. I looked at the corp and it had around 60 members. I used the excellent [www.evewho.com](http://www.evewho.com) to find the names of the corp members. It was quite a new corp and all but one of members was less than 6 weeks old. I added all corp members as contacts and put them on my watch list (another great tool is [http://www.markedfordeath.dk/](http://www.markedfordeath.dk/) but it isn't free). There was only a max of 12 of them online at any one point in time, but they appear to play for very long continuous periods. If they're all like the first guy I encountered, I've got some serious work to do to help them get out of warp and into targeting 'roids and pressing F1.

**LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION**

I asked a Locator Agent where the guy was. Turns out he was in the same system as before and he isn't docked. His online corp buddies all appeared to be dotted around in systems quite close (4 or 5 jumps) to him, all high-sec. I cruise over to his system and find him in a belt. But what's this? He has found some 'roids and is mining away! Yay! He also has 2 corp buddies in system who are mining too. I congratulate them in local on having found some 'roids to mine. Unfortunately, they all appear to be very shy and didn't respond.

**GENTLE PHYSICAL ENCOURAGEMENT**

I don't mind if people don't speak in local or respond to convos. Some people just like a bit of peace and quiet. We all do at times. But there was something not quite right here. So whilst I was flying my sturdy Thorax and thought I'd provoke them a bit. I bumped their retrievers away from their 'roids. Maybe that will get one of them to at least call me an asshole. But no. All that happened was the retrievers would align back to their spots and carry on mining. It was almost as if they were all being controlled by the same ""mind"".

**NOT SO GENTLE PHYSICAL ENCOURAGEMENT**

Maybe the gentle bumping Thorax wasn't up to the task. Something more persuasive was needed. I present to you, the [Bumping Stabber of Doom](http://i.imgur.com/aPcemoX.png) - a dual nano'd 100mn MWD streamlined speed merchant. Basic version does a healthy 7,500m/s. Warm it up and have a mate with Loki links giving you a hand and you'll be getting near 14,000m/s. Having nice implants in your head aswell may just cause the poor Minmatar ship to fall to pieces.

I'm in the BSoD ([yes I know](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death)) 150km away from my target. The BSoD needs a long run up to hit top speed. I approach the retriever and hit the MWD. Upon impact the retriever is projected away from the belt at [unheard of subwarp speeds](http://i.imgur.com/61qoSC4.png) (for a mining barge anyway). It takes his lumbering ship around 100km to slow back down to a normal speed. As he did though, he aligned back to his mining spot. How odd! It would surely be quicker to warp off and back to the belt. I provide this friendly tip in local. It is met with silence yet again. I bump him a few more times. He is now 400km from the belt. But yet again, the retriever just aligns back to his spot, travelling at 90m/s. A quick calculation says that he'll make it back to belt in about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Or to put it another way, about 450 times longer than it would take to warp there. His corp mates all exhibit the same behaviour when I thrust the BSoD upon them too. I'm now really concerned for the welfare of these ""players"". They are acting almost machine like and that is not healthy.

**RATS!**

Oh noes, some belt rats have turned up and he's forgotten to launch his drones! My BSoD doesn't have any guns or drones so I can't help. I've failed him! Oh, but what's this? As soon as one of the rats attack him, his drones pop out, they slay the rats and then quickly return into the safety of the retrievers drone bay. All of this happens whilst he is slow boating back to the belt that is a [looong way away](http://i.imgur.com/aGdwmQT.png). 

So what I had seen thus far is that there is a corp full of very similar players who:

*Never converse with other players.

*Always instantly align back to their mining spot if bumped away.

*Always pop drones out the second a rat agresses them and recall them the second the rats have been popped.

*Always return to station as soon as their cargo is full.

*Always return to the same spot to mine after emptying cargo.

*Fly around in circles when belts are almost stripped bare (wasn't always the case though).

*Don't use warp when it would be exceptionally prudent to do so.

*Have tremendous stamina to pay attention and react within a second or 2 for many consecutive hours for many consecutive days.

Or alternatively, what we have here is a corp full of mining bots, most likely supporting an RMT operation. There was only one thing I could think to do in this situation...

**WARDECK!**

I'm in my own 1 man corp and I'm now at war with a 60+ pilot bot corp. I was away for the first couple of days of the wardeck. When I returned I was happy to see they were still carrying on as usual. Not wanting to spook them, I had an alt spy on them and check which belts they were in. I hop into my trusty Harpy and jump into their system. There were 2 of them in local. I warp to one of them. He carries on mining. I kill his retriever and then his pod. I repeat this for the other guy in system. I go to one of their other frequented systems and pop several more. I go to another system, I pop one guy + his pod and then warp to the other guy. I sit next to him for 15 minutes. He warps to station, unloads his stash of ore and warps right back next to me. I'm sitting their flashing away and he continues mining. Do I need anymore confirmation that they are all bots? His ship and pod get reduced to space dust after I let him mine for another 10 minutes. I don't really need the ore in the wrecks so I blue them and tell local to help themselves. A few days of easy kills and easy profit was coming my way. Or so I thought.

**CLEVER BOTS**

The next day I login and see some of them online. A Locator Agent confirms they are in space in the same systems as before so I zoom off for another bout of bot killing. My alt has already got visuals and noted the belts they are currently in. I jump my main in ready for some more explosions. But then within 2 seconds of my main jumping into system, my alt witnesses the bot aligning to station, warping off and docking. I go to another system and the exact same thing happens again. I try this many times over the space of a day or 2 and the same things keep on happening, always within a second or 2 of me jumping into system. 

**ADAPT OR (THEY DON'T) DIE**

I had to change my plan. I couldn't let them continue botting like this! I try a login trap. I enter system &amp; warp to belt, they dock, I log off and wait 30mins. I login and smile when I see his retriever on scan at the belt. I'm in warp and land in the belt... just as he warps off to the station. Bugger it. Right, I'll log off at their station and catch them whilst the try to dock. Only this isn't too reliable and I don't always have time to lock them and kill them before they dock. It worked maybe 25% of the time. 

Next plan: I had my alt cloak on their station, my main is logged off in belt. I watch with my alt when the bot undocks (usually between 10 and 20 minutes after my main ""leaves"" system). As soon as he enters warp, my main logs in and... success! I catch them almost every time. 

The trouble is I have to keep an eye on the undock and it takes quite a lot of idle time just to kill a couple of them using this method. Then it finally struck me... Use the BSoD to ""juggle"" the retrievers whilst my main jumps in and warps to the belt. They will not be able to warp to the station as they will still be traveling at high speed in a different direction. It worked superbly. I got a load more kills and was able to continue to another system without logging off and waiting.

**MORE DUBIOUS BEHAVIOR**

Gradually over the week, as a corp they log in less and less. One day, I see the boss of the corp log in. He's a much older pilot. A locator Agent tells me where he is and my alt follows him. A bot that I previously killed logs in and goes to the boss's station. Aha! I bet boss has just purchased another retriever for the bot. But what happened next surprised me a bit as I didn't know about this sort of jiggery-pokery. The boss undocks in a retriever, and bot undocks in a noob ship. They both fly to planet one and I observe them ejecting and swapping ships. What is happening here is a possible method to stop CCP seeing where / who the bots get their gear from, even though it's pretty darn obvious when you look at the corp. But I saw this happen 2 times. Both times the name of the retriever wasn't changed so the bot was was flying it with the name of ""Boss's name Retriever"". Made it easy to find them in system!

In the end I got over 20 kills, caused around half a bil ISK of damage and reduced them to a very minimal botting outfit where the didn't log in for several days. I know people will point and laugh at those stats but that will be missing the point of why I did this. I had zero knowledge of bots and I enjoyed the challenge of identifying and adapting to the bots changing behaviors. I also got almost instant pewpew as and when I could logon (which wasn't much at that time). I made somewhere around 80mil in salvage / loot which covered the cost of the wardeck.

Names of the guilty are (temporarily) protected to see the effect of reporting them as bots to CCP and to potentially give me a chance of wardecking them again in the future. Though smart folks may be able to work out who they are.

WELCOME to STATION TRADING 101

You asked for it, reddit, so here it is: my guide to making your fortune by playing the market in EVE.  I'll be covering the basics of station trading in EVE.  This guide is written from my perspective, working my way up from an initial investment of 500 million ISK to about 2 billion in ISK + assets in about 2 weeks.

**Table of Contents:**

1. Preface
2. Skills
3. Home Base
4. Choosing Items
5. Setting Up Orders
6. Checking and Maintaining Orders

 

    1.Preface

This guide is written from my personal experience trading.  The techniques used here may or may not work for you.  That being said, I believe that once you get a decent amount of ISK to start with (hundreds of millions), the best way to further your wealth is to do station trading with the ISK.  Unless you find joy in spreadsheets and numbers and never undocking, I recommend the creation of an alt to use for station trading only.  I have an alt that I use for trading that does nothing but modify orders.  No ships, no undocking, just numbers.  Before beginning, here is what I recommend you have:

* An alt that you don't mind not flying with again on an account that can spare a few days of skill training time.

* Investment capital.  I suggest starting with at least 500m but as low as 100m will still generate profit that is not insignificant.

    2. Skills

As a trader in EVE, you'll need a few skills to make a profit and make sure that this profit is as large as it can be.  There are plenty of of skills in the ""Trade"" category, but many of these are not needed for basic station trading.  Many of these skills are not strictly necessary for trading; it's very simple to flip items and make a profit.  However, to maximize your profit margins and ensure that you can always keep up with your orders, it is a good idea to train these skills to respectable levels. For now, there's not much reason in bothering with the skills that modify the range at which you can modify buy and sell orders as you'll likely have an alt that will remain in one station trading permanently.  There are three groups of skills we need to train. 

The first is to decrease the amount of ISK that is taken from our market orders through market related costs.  The skills **Accounting** and **Broker Relations** are used to decrease this margin.  These are good skills to train because they reduce the amount of ISK that is taken out of your pocket by game mechanics with every transaction. 

The second group is a single skill: **Margin Trading**.  This skill reduces the amount of ISK you have to put down when you make a buy order.  Without the skill, if you make a buy order for 1,000 units of Tritanium at 1.00 ISK each, you have to put down the entire 1,000 ISK required upon making the order.  However, with **Margin Trading** I, you only have to put down 750 ISK to make the order.  The other 250 ISK is subtracted from your wallet upon completion of the order.  This way, you can have many more active buy orders than you have ISK. For example, I currently have 869 million ISK in active buy orders.  Because I have **Margin Trading** IV, I only had to put down 163 million ISK.  I have 464 million ISK remaining in my wallet.  This means that if all of my buy orders filled simultaniously, I would not be able to pay for them all.  Although this might seem like a bad idea, in reality buy orders usually fill very slowly, and the ISK you make through sell orders comes through at a rate fast enough to replenish your wallet before it is drained by buy orders.  This makes this skill very handy to have. 

The third group of skills is the group that modifies the amount of active buy and sell orders you can have.  The amount of orders allowed by these skills grows with each progressive skill, starting with 4 orders per skill level of **Trade** and increasing to 32 orders per skill level of **Tycoon**.  Earlier on (high millions/low billions) you will likely not need to train above Wholesale, if at all.  Later on, if you choose to increase the volume of orders you manage, you may wish to train further.  Keep in mind that although more active orders = larger income, it also increases the time you need to go through all of your orders and make sure they remain on top.

Skills:

**Accounting**

&gt;Proficiency at squaring away the odds and ends of business transactions, keeping the check books tight.  Each level of skill reduces transaction tax by 10%.  **Requires: Trade IV**

**Broker Relations**

&gt;Proficiency at driving down market-related costs.  Each level of skill grants a 5% reduction in the costs associated with setting up a market order, which usually come to 1% of the order's total value. This can be further influenced by the player's standing towards the owner of the station where the order is entered.  **Requires: Trade II**

**Trade**

&gt;Knowledge of the market and skill at manipulating it. Active buy/sell order limit increased by 4 per level of skill.

**Retail**

&gt;Ability to organize and manage market operations.  Each level raises the limit of active orders by 8.  **Requires: Trade II**

**Wholesale**

&gt;Ability to organize and manage large-scale market operations.  Each level raises the limit of active orders by 16.Ability to organize and manage large-scale market operations.  Each level raises the limit of active orders by 16.  **Requires: Retail V, Marketing II**

**Tycoon**

&gt;Ability to organize and manage ultra large-scale market operations.  Each level raises the limit of active orders by 32. **Requires: Wholesale V**

    3. Home Base

Once you've started skill training and feel that you've trained enough to begin trading, you'll need to choose a home base.  Your home base depends on the amount of time you'll be able to dedicate to trading.  Someone who updates their orders every 15 minutes will find that they will make much more money in Jita than in Rens, while someone who updates their orders once or twice a day generally won't make as much ISK in Jita as they could in another trade hub where their orders will not be undercut as often.  The top three trade hubs in order from largest to smallest are Jita, Amarr, and Rens.  [Here](http://users.telenet.be/mmodata/EVE/EveTradeHubs.htm) is a link to a table of EVE's 30 top trade hubs.  If you find the hub you're trading in to be too competitive, it might be a good idea to find another one farther down on that list and switch to that hub. 

My experience trading in Jita 4-4 has been a positive one.  It is frustrating to see people undercut my order by a large amount, but in general I have enjoyed the fast paced market and the quick ISK generation.  After settling on a home station, get your character there and dock up.  Enjoy the sights as your ship is towed into the station, you won't be seeing them on that particular character any time soon.

Tales from J172751,GiggidyAndPie,420,79,155,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/18qqzx/trapped_tales_from_j172751/,"So I've gone and gotten myself trapped in a c3 wormhole with a bunch of hostiles. My corpie had probed a wormhole being collapsed by an orca, and was sitting 10 off the hole and the orca cloaked, slowly burning in. I warped to him, and as soon as I landed on grid the Orca jumped through the reduced mass wormhole. In my haste to get a point on him on the other side, I decided that it would be totally fun to jump into the now critical mass wormhole with my MWD on in a Talos. The wormhole collapsed behind me before the prober and any other fleet support could arrive. I entered grid near planet IX with a drake, an enyo, the orca, a raven, and a Thanatos, as well as an un-named cargo container within 10km of me.


I arrived with 640 void L in my guns, 2k null, 4k void, 800 CN AM and 100 paste in my cargo hold, and 5 warrior IIs in my drone bay. I broke cloak, overheated my mids, and aligned out towards the central planetary cluster, then started shooting the drake. I was hitting the drake for 2k's, and surprisingly volleying him by 40% shields each time I shot, but my dps was not enough to break the thanny's reps. I had somewhat stupidly decided to throw my drones onto the enyo, and ended up warping off without them, but not before i bookmarked the cargo container that had been right off the wormhole.


As I bounced a few safes, I prepared to warp back to the can, hoping that it held a bookmark to another wormhole out of there (who knows, maybe their corp bookmarks were full &gt;.&gt;), but without much hope for anything worthwhile. I warped to it at 20, landed 50 off of their fleet, and quickly MWD'd over to the can and clicked loot all. Turn's out it didn't have bookmarks. It had something so much better...a tech two mobile small warp disruptor.  

In my mad dash to scoop the loot, the thanny decided that it didn't want me to safely log off, and put a flight of fighters on me to attempt to keep me perma agressed until downtime. Hohohohohoho, time to kill some fighters! I warp off to the farthest celestial and start making bookmarks in alphabetical order. As I land, I immediately align back where i came from and started warping down the alphabet. As I landed at I, I cycled my MWD and preparred to blap some drones. It was at this time that the locals suggested a ransom. It was an excellent chance to play for time. 

﻿[ 2013.02.18 03:37:29 ] LongGanticus &gt; Ransom?

The drones landed 25 off me and started to MWD after me. I locked up an einherji, pressed f1, and prepared to warp to my next safe. As the first fighter exploded, I entered warp and tried to distract them.

﻿[ 2013.02.18 03:37:41 ] God Hiimself &gt; ill pay 15 mil for an exit.


I realize that this was a total low-ball, but I had an opportunity to win the ever-important isk war. I had to seize it. I landed, cycled MWD, locked up another einherji and started to fire once again.

﻿[ 2013.02.18 03:38:02 ] LongGanticus &gt; Your ship is worth 150, implants 100,

Rats, they're on to my schemeings. Still, 100 mil in dead fighters isn't bad, in addition to the theft of the warp bubble. I started rolling between the planets and making some safes while continuing to chat up the locals.

Lol that wasn't obvious. I haven't sent them any money, but I was half hoping they were either A: really really dumb and had actually gotten the wormhole and were sitting on it hoping to kill me before I jumped through, or B: Sitting pretty in a bubble where I could pick them off.

I decided to take my chances and warped to the thanny pilot at 50, thinking they wouldn't put the Thanny in a bubble voluntarily. Well, I was wrong, I landed right in the middle of their entire gang. 6km from everything on field, I overheated my mids, activated mwd and burned like hell. Luckily, the enyo pilot lived up to his corp history and didn't land scram, and the drake pilot only managed to land one cycle of disruptor on me before I warped away to safe. To be honest, it was a bit premature to warp off, the thanny might have decided to put more fighters on me, or the enyo might have burned in a direct straight line out of thanny rep range and into my guns, but I didn't stick around to find out. Instead, I decided to taunt them again!

[ 2013.02.18 04:01:37 ] Fancy Stars &gt; no bs

I believe you, I really really do! We discussed a price (I said 10 mil, he said 100 mil, I said 10 mil again), but decided that it would be more fun for me to stay a while and crash on their couch. 

I warped to a few of my safes and put out some cans with an SoS call for any visiting wormholers offering a reward for an exit out, then start to make some tactical bookmarks and some grid fu spots on their PoS's so that I could drag the grid past the PoS aggro range and catch some orca's doing some hole closings, or maybe some of their site running ships. I had a nice chat with Fancy stars' alt pretending to be a new player about getting me out of the wormhole, where I again offered him 45 mil (but only 20 up front) for the exit. He declined. I tried to catch the two orcas they were using to roll their static with my pull bubble, but I mis-scanned the planet that the wormhole was at (i put the pull bubble in line with IX when it was really from VIII, they were fairly close together), and ended up missing them, so now I am logged off, my prized bubble secure in my cargo hold, and ready to wreck some nerds tommorrow. 


So here are my thoughts. I'm going to turn this into a challenge. I'm not going to self destruct myself out of the wormhole, I am going to stay until I die or until I am rescued by non-inhabitants, and I am going to try to kill as many carebears as possible before i meet my fate. I have 100 units of paste, about 8000 units of ammo, and a whole damn lot of time to kill. Would you guys be interested in more reporting from J172751, possibly with screenshots and more logs? Let me know if you enjoyed this and what I could improve upon. 


P.S.  I'm offering a 50 mil reward for finding me an exit out if you happen to stumble upon the hole while exploring.



EDIT 1: I haven't had a whole ton of time to play today, but there's been a sad update. Mobile Small Warp Disruptor II, Or Companion Cu...Bubble...fell in the line of duty. While set up to pull a suspiciously fit raven between their two POS's (Observed both cloak and MJD on the raven at one time), It was warped to by an ares, and after I missed my first two volleys even before it hit max speed, I decided to warp off grid, as interceptors and other frigate class ships are going to be relatively unkillable until I manage to find some drones, or make my way in with an alt. They then warped a dominix in and proceeded to heartlessly destroy my beloved bubble.  I'm planning on sitting a long-skill deployment, relatively inactive alt in the hole once I do find my way out, just to keep having some fun with the locals. I'll give a more indepth update later after I'm done writing an essay and doing some other misc. work.

My alliance, Liandri Covenant is a caldari FW alliance. We had put a bare-bones safespot small POS up on a worthless moon in asakai to use as we reclaimed space. Yesterday, the tower was hit and sieged by Drunk 'n' Disorderly alliance, with a small cap fleet but enough to prevent us from doing much of anything. Not really caring about the tower at all, and just the fights/kills, we decided to batphone anyone we could get ahold of.

 At around 0100 our tower came out of reinforced, and shortly after I led a fleet that engaged DND. the fight ended with us in a loss, but as we warped out a Goon cyno popped up on field, and a Levi, several carriers of various flavors, and a few supers entered the field.

We all laughed a bit at how it went down, then another cyno went up. This one was PL. This soon escalated into non stop reinforcements from various alliances and factions for about 2 hours, when the TIDI hit 10% and local hit 700. Soon afterwards, the subcap fleets arrived; and with more capitals entering the field every moment, Local soon spiked at 2800 people online.

AMA (non-NDA) about EVE, the CSM &amp; CCP.",Seleene,377,70,556,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/ypde9/im_seleene_former_ccp_game_designer_and_current/,"As stated in the title, I may have ~things~ to say if you ask some questions.  [Twitter: @Seleene_EVE](https://twitter.com/Seleene_EVE)

So, an intro for those that don't know, or think they know, me.

I've been playing EVE since May of 2003, long before there were things like capital ships, supercarriers, tech moons and a half-ass good tutorial. I started out mining Omber for weeks in a Punisher to earn the ISK for my first BPO (a Blackbird) and flew my ship uphill, in the snow, etc... We didn't have fancy things like 'alliances' or Tech 2 ships. Kestrels made great haulers until you managed to find someone building Bestowers and good luck finding one on the open market!

In April of 2004 I started a mercenary corporation, Body Count Inc. (BDCI), with an uninsured Scorpion battleship, a Crow interceptor and 30 million ISK to my name. There was no mechanic for mercs so we just made it up as we went along, eventually gathering up a few other like-minded folks and formed what became known as the Mercenary Coalition. I was the leader / executor / accountant / glue / whatever of the alliance and aged about a year for every month I did it. After about 3-4 years of [rampaging around](http://img.bdci-eve.net/warreport/index.html) I closed the doors on MC.

From November 2006 - February 2010 I was a Game Designer at CCP. My dev name was CCP Abathur.  Over the course of three years I touched on nearly every aspect of EVE game play in some form. My time at CCP is more detailed [here](http://seleenes-sandbox.blogspot.com/2011/01/ccp-connection.html).

While I was at CCP, I watched the birth of the CSM experiment and worked with the elected players. As a player, I continued to believe in the potential of the CSM so I ran myself, getting elected to both CSM 6 and CSM 7, where I now serve as the Chairman.

Since my return to EVE I've taken the duties of CEO of my corp back over, my mercenary leanings eventually landing us in Pandemic Legion. So, contrary to popular belief, I've done a few other things than just be in the Legion for the past year and that is likely why the rest of the CSM voted me into the Chairman position.

I've started this AMA because I prefer a more interactive approach than just straight blogging. Now that the CSM Summit Minutes are out, after doing a couple of 'Town Hall' meetings on EVE Radio, and with CCP getting ready to enter release planning for the Winter expansion, it's more important than ever to keep the Q &amp; A going.

I will do my best to answer questions as they happen but may be AFK from time to time. If I don't know or can't talk about something and say that, please just let it be.  Otherwise, ask away! :)

TEST Forums SOTA post:::

""Today we fought in 6VDT. We didn’t fight to save the station, we didn’t fight to win an ISK war, and we didn’t fight to turn the war around.
 
We fought today because we need to show the game that we play a bit differently than you're 'supposed' to. Because we want to show the galaxy that all problems aside we can still field about as many autists as anyone else in the game – coalition or not - instead of standing down and crying in the corner like other alliances faced with the same fate. 
 
We fought because TEST stands together in the face of certain, guaranteed death.
 
I wanted to give Fountain one HELL of a sendoff, and it's incredibly appropriate that it took place in our home system of 2+ years. 
 
This war has taught us many things – We’ve learned what we can do at our best, and we’ve learned what we need to do to properly support our FCs, leadership, and membership.
 
We made an absolutely fantastic showing today. We fielded more members than any single alliance has ever seen – we even had twice what CONDI alone brought – and we set a record for the largest fight EVE has ever seen by a few hundred pilots, maybe even a thousand. Hell, TRIBE pulled more numbers than anyone in the CFC besides goons. Even our bros RIOT brought a big chunk of spaceships.
 
So with all that said, we’ve been losing a defensive war for about two weeks now. As soon as our big strong capfleet-toting allies had to run home, the CFC pulled out all the stops, and TEST was unable to keep up on our own. They practically rolled through Fountain unopposed.
 
This isn’t the fault of our members. It isn’t our FCs faults, or our mildir’s fault, or logi, or recon, or our corp CEOs… This war has been an immense team effort, and one of the most significant things we’ve learned is that our team needs some improvement before we can function together well enough to pull off a large scale war like this.
 
 
What can be done about this?
 
First off, we’re going to undeploy and head back to NOL in Delve.
Delve is a slightly more defensible position, and our allies seem to prefer fighting here. But that’s not why we need to retreat.
 
We need time to do the work we should’ve done 3 months ago. 3 years ago. We have to clean up our leadership groups and structure in order to handle something as significant as a full on coalition-level war – or something as simple as record-breaking activity numbers.
 
 
The CFC will almost definitely attack Delve, either in a continuation of their full-scale invasion, or with prodding tests like we saw before 1-SMEB. It will give us an opportunity to put some strain on a rebuilt leadership structure and see how we function. I will be constantly re-evaluating our position the entire time, but for now that’s the plan.
 
On the topic of leadership re-structuring, we’re going to do something TEST has never seen before, and bring FCs even more into the fold of day-to-day leadership-ing; this will allow all leadership groups to provide them the proper support that historically has gone through a select 2 or 3 military people. That’s about all that’s set in stone so far, you’ll hear more later on. Also, shortbus/schoolyard are being reformed and given less stupid names.
 
 
I can only hope that you don't feel I've thrown away your donations to the alliance. Ultimately, the sov is here so we have something to fight about, and I felt it best to spend our cash in the bloodiest, largest, most amazing fight the EVE community or even the video game community at large has ever seen.
 
So fellow TESTies, follow me back to Delve, and let’s set out on a journey to make TEST the alliance this community deserves.""

TEST shocked the player community with it's massive defense of Delve earlier this year. It was epic. TEST shot up it's middle finger and said FUCK YOU to the rest of the map. It was awesome. 

Then the CFC invaded Fountain. At the beginning of the war TEST was enthusiastic and gave no fucks. You threw your ships at the enemy and laughed off losses. You got in fleets to have fun. You had swag. 

Then N3 joined you in your war against the CFC. The CFC assault came to a cold standstill. The CFC were creating timers but they couldn't contest them. The N3ST numbers were to strong and the threat of N3 + PL cap fleets prevented the CFC from using supers for structures. It would have been suicide for the CFC to drop supers or use caps because N3ST had subcap and capital dominance. The major timers that we all expected a big CFC fight never came. They knew they would be beaten and it would be bad for morale. If you want to see how well things were going re-read this: http://themittani.com/news/test-fountain-update-tale-two-weeks

The weeks following were mostly each side creating timers and the other side showing up and repping those timers. Fleet participation on the N3ST side began to dwindle while fleet participation on the CFC side began to increase. Even still the match was even with neither side making much progress. 

Then the massive sov drop back in the east. One of the most impressive operations took place and a massive number of supers took back the sov of almost all the systems in 24 hours. The pilots flying these supers are not machines but players like you and I that stayed up all night to grind those systems back and then redeploy back to the west. This was a serious commitment and shows the level of commitment that N3 is willing to go. 

While N3 was performing a miracle in the East, the CFC took the opportunity to reinforce many systems using caps in Fountain (12?). The N3ST cap fleet contested and saved all but 1. Another miracle and another display of control. 

Up until this past week the CFC progress has been laughable at best and complete failure at worst. They had their victories but dotlan told the real story. Their progress was pitiful.

This past week has been the CFC's best week and they are riding high on smug. NC. HAS to go back east to reclaim the space that N3 has lost. This is critical for continued income which pays the war effort. This is an expensive war for everyone and it's absolutely essential that N3's income stream stays in tact. That sov loss and rental robbery did hurt. Had that not happened the current operation to reclaim the east could probably have lasted a bit longer.

This isn't about NC. returning and PL getting done with ATXI. This is about TEST putting the numbers back into fleets that they had at the beginning of the war. Yes, this war is a grind and often times there are stressed out FCs that yell and they even make some mistakes. However, the only reason CFC is making progress is because we have lost our subcap superiority. That superiority came from TEST.

Despite all the CFC propaganda (and there is a lot of it), TEST has the chance to make history. Despite the fact that the CFC continually exploits the meta game, TEST has the numbers to push CFC out of fountain. Despite the fact that TEST is not swimming in ISK, TEST continues to find ways to resupply ships. 

The CFC came at you TEST, and if you continue to put multiple fleets together they cannot take Fountain with N3 fighting at your side. I have seen less and less swag from TEST membership lately and even some are believing the CFC propaganda. Regain your swag! #YOLO420 and PLEASE regain Reddit!

I'm gonna start off from the end of the original fist post, and we'll see where we get to from there.


After checking my inbox to see that my SoS signal had not been located and that there wasn't going to be any exit in the near future, I decided to check p on the residents. Only two of them logged in, both sitting afk at their PoS exactly where they were prior to downtime when i had logged in previously. I logged off and played some other games, did a bit of studying, and logged back in again a few hours later. Again, no activity. 

I repeated this process for a while, until I finally found some activity. The raven from last night was warping around, as well as a dominix and two orcas. I warped to the planet 8 PoS to check and see if I could figure out what planet the wormhole they were no doubt collapsing was located at. 

It unfortunately had spawned on planet 8 itself, so there wasn't a great chance of my being able to put my bubble in line with them and catching myself an orca. I hung around at about 375k from the tower, just watching them warp in and out and waiting for something interesting to happen. I was extremely puzzled when it did. 


The raven all of a sudden landed about 100km off of the POS from a random other planet near the center of the system. Then it cloaked. ""O.K. so they really enjoy putting cloaks on their ships. I guess that might be a new fad for wormhole carebears. He'll probably just sit there and provide a different warp in for something else,"" I thought. But I was wrong, it turns out the fitting ingenuity of these people knows no bounds. The raven decloaked about 15 seconds afterwards, then proceeded to Micro Jump Drive his way into the POS. 

I sat there for five seconds, just staring at my screen, then said aloud ""You've got to be joking, right?"". Either way, I hatched a plan to destroy this ""interestingly"" fit raven. I knew that the pilot normally sat afk in the other PoS in the system, at planet 10, so I warped over and set up a catch bubble and waited for him at about 30km, meanwhile spamming my D-scanner. 

Unfortunately, the raven declined to warp. Instead, an ares showed up on long range scan. I aligned back towards planet 8 and started burning. About 4 seconds later, the ares landed in the bubble, 45km away from me. 

The ares was going to be a problem. Since I was without drones, my one shot at really killing this guy was going to be sniping him with null as soon as my lock finished, otherwise there was too much of a risk of getting disrupted or scrambled as soon as he hit his lock range on me. 

There was still a shot that I could get him though, as he was sitting still as i started to lock him up. I kept burning away hoping he would chase me without burning an orbit. My timer hit 4 seconds, and he started to move, straight towards me! His traversal was very low, only about 200m/s, but he was reaching a very high speed and had closed the gap to 40k. The timer was ticking down, 3, 2, 1.5...and then he decided to burn directly upwards. His traversal hit 4.5k/s right as my lock finished, and my shot missed him by a mile. I hurriedly warped off before he got any closer and could land a point, if he caught me I was going to be toast.


So now I had a dilemma. My best shot at catching any of their vulnerable ships was being camped by a ship that I had no chance of killing, and would likely spell my doom if I got caught by. There wasn't a lot I could do, but I had to try to save the only friend I had in this wormhole. I warped back to a different ping spot, about 400km away from the bubble and 375 off of the tower, then started to slowly burn towards my bubble in an arc around the tower, pulsing MWD and saving cap. The ares continued to orbit the bubble for a while, then a dominix landed in it and launched hammerheads. The ares left the bubble and started burning towards me, our distance being about 230km. 

It was possible I could bait the ares and warp to my bubble here, but the domi that was presently pummeling it with his hammerheads was probably dangerous to get close to; If i warped to the bubble I would have to warp right on top of it, putting me within 10km of the dominix, and then I would have to burn to within 5km of the bubble to start unanchoring it, definitely taking me through scramble range. 

It was a risk I couldn't afford to take. While a tear slid quietly down my cheek, I aligned and warped out to an offgrid spot, and watched on my scanner as my precious bubble, my companion and only friend in this place of forgotten space, disappeared. As the name ""Mobile Small Warp Disruptor II"" blinked off my scanner, the tear on my cheek fell, splashing on to the floor. I was filled with anguish...but also a desire for vengeance. They killed something that was important to me, something special. They would pay. I waited out my timer and logged off, swearing that I would have my revenge the next day. 






I woke up fueled with purpose. Today they would learn just how dangerous I could be. After warping to their PoS, I was again offered an exit for 100 million. I declined. 

A few of their scanning ships warped off and dropped probes, so I started to bounce some safes, look at who was online and what was in their PoSes. With no interceptors or assault frigates on scan, I was ready to fight. I warped to the sun and passively aligned off, waiting for them to come to me. I waited for about 20 minutes, then I warped to the far side of the system just to let them know I wasn't AFK. After landing at planet 11, I burned off 50km, and then passively aligned to one of my safes again. After quite some time, a Deimos came on scan, 


This was definitely good news, a Deimos was definitely engageable, and possibly killable before any help could arrive for him. He sat on my scanner for a good 5 minutes, then landed at the PoCo.

I loaded up null, turned around and warped back to the Poco at 70km.  He immediately started burning towards me, MWD on. I aligned backwards towards my safe again, and let him get a bit closer. When he hit 50km, I turned on my MWD and started shooting. I was getting good hits, his shield dropped after two hits, and then chunks just started falling out of his armor. 

Blam! 30% was gone, Blam! another 25% taken down. A domi and a raven poked onto my scanner. He hit structure, then went up to 25% armor again. 

I was anxious to finish him off before his reinforcements landed, but he was at 35km, out of point range. He had something like 20% armor and 60% structure HP left. If he managed to align away, he could get out.

I cycled my MWD off and overheated my guns and disruptor. I started spamming my point, waiting for him to hit 29km. I hit another volley, taking him down to 30% structure, then he repped again to 30% armor. He was at 33 km, and his speed started to change. I turned back towards him, hoping I could burn those 4km to get him pointed, spamming my disruptor. Suddenly, it activated at 32km out. Right afterwards, I volley'd him through the rest of his armor and structure, and a beautiful blue explosion replaced his ship. 

(Kill mail: http://mafiaredux.com/kb/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=21217)

An interesting little fact about this wormhole, is that it is a red giant. Most people know of red giant wormholes for the excellent bonuses to smart bombs they give. However, they also give a very hefty bonus to overheating- 55% bonus on overheat bonusing, and a 22% bonus to heat damage in c3 wormholes. This is what allowed me to point him at the extended range, and it also increased my volley damage with null to about 4k, with 950 dps. 


I didn't quite have time to gloat (or loot), because just as he exploded, the dominix and raven landed on field. I was ready to fight. My vengeance cometh. 


They had landed 80km off me, so I turned around, and started burning in. They launched their drones towards me right as I started to hit the raven and pointed it with heat on, trying to maintain about a 29km distance. I was chunking it through shields, and taking minimal damage from its cruise missiles (The dominix wasn't hitting me at all), when I lost lock. The drones they had both tossed onto me were vespa EC-600s; the medium variant of dishonor drones.

The raven had hit very low shields, so unless this was some sort of ridiculous armor fit raven (and it could have been, for all I knew. They don't appear to be fitting wizards to say the least), I could probably kill it if the jams dropped. The timer and my shields slowly counted down as I burned past and around the raven and dominix, back towards the Poco. As the timer hit 5 seconds, The deimos pilot decloaked in an arazu about 60km away from me.

As I had just learned from my experience with the deimos, overheating your point can make it reach out to very unexpected distances. Adding the Arazu's bonus to point range made for a very scary situation. I overheated MWD, and started burning like I was trying to outrun the fires of hell. I didn't get pointed however. Instead, I was dampened down, to about a 9km lock range.


It was time to leave, no sense in staying on field and just getting pummeled. When i hit 100km, the raven lost lock, I bookmarked the deimos wreck, and I initiated warp to a safe. It was time to make them an offer, but not the one they expected.

Yes, yes I could see that. I wasn't interested in the same tired old offer again. I had made a vow. There would be no self destructing out. I was here to stay.

﻿[ 2013.02.20 03:32:51 ] God Hiimself &gt; im really mad you guys killed my bubble earlier. it was unkind.

﻿[ 2013.02.20 03:34:02 ] flaming girl &gt; It's free to wait.

It seemed that they couldn't see who was the one that needed to be making a deal, and who was the one that was going to be exacting a toll. I decided to remind them with some inspiration from Watchmen.

﻿[ 2013.02.20 03:36:02 ] God Hiimself &gt; well, for me it is


﻿[ 2013.02.20 03:41:12 ] God Hiimself &gt; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B3lsJmwNO40

I was planning on waiting out my timer after repping all my damage (Couldn't rep my guns, didn't have enough nanite, but the 75% damage on my point and MWD was fixable), but then I saw that the arazu pilot logged off. This would be a very good chance to try and take out either the raven or the domi. I warped back to the wreck at 50, the Domi and raven were about 30 behind me. I again overheated my point and guns and started wailing on the dominix while trying to burn past them back towards my safe. He also started to get chunked very very hard, but he hit me with smart bombs as I burned past him, and he had switched to damage drones. My shield's got chunked by the smart bombs, and the raven and drones was dealing decent amounts of damage, so i overheated MWD and guns and aligned out, waiting to see if he would pop before I had to warp. My shields hit 30% as he hit 20% armor. Another volley of missiles and drone guns hit me, taking me down to 15% shield, right as my guns cycled. He hit low structure. I saw the raven launch another volley, then watched as my overheated guns finally cycled. Pop! I warped away just before the next volley landed.

(Killmail: http://mafiaredux.com/kb/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=21218) 

It should seem that these wormholers are deathly allergic to armor plates, and also have some kind of weird fetish for stacking penalties and not fitting against your enemies ~~known~~ only damage type. Also they have an inability to warp away.


I again repaired my MWD and Point (i only had 20 paste left after finishing repairs), then warped to an offgrid to see if the raven still wanted to play. He was on scan there with a merlin. I warped to 100 to see if the merlin would come after me, and if I could blap it as it burned in. After landing, it was very clear that it was AB fit, and after dicking around the deimos wreck, it warped off. Then suddenly, the raven was right next to  me.


Ohhh, right. The Micro Jump Drive Raven. Welp. 


I overheated MWD and burned, put point on him, and started shooting. My guns were at 98% damage, couldn't overheat on him this time. The merlin pilot came back in a drake and started to add his fire to the raven's. I was taking a surprisingly high amount of damage, with the drake chunking 12% of my shields every volley, and the raven about 8%. They forced me off as the raven hit 30% shields. 


As I landed in my safe and started to repair, I checked my shield HP. 6383 maximum...wait what? That can't be right. I opened up my fitting window and saw a depressing sight. One of my two Large Shield extenders had burned out. With extender rigs and skills to take into consideration, burning out that extender costed me about 4khp. I couldn't see this previously because I had hidden passive modules on my HUD to reduce clutter. Luckily, I had enough nanite to repair the second extender from 98% damage, leaving me with 4 paste. I waited out my timer and logged off, content with the work i had done.

That is the state of affairs as they stand currently. I am severely handicapped by the loss of my extender, and in great need of resupply, as null stocks are starting to run low, and I am virtually out of paste. Keep the vigil, for ""Mobile Small Warp Disruptor 2""'s sake. If ever you find yourself in J172751, be sure to remember and honor the sacrifice of that noble soul. Preferably by exacting him some vengeance.



EDIT: I forgot, I have the names of all active pilot's I've seen in the wormhole for those of you who wanted to try to locate the entrance. Here they are:

Golden Kusoni 

LongGanticus 

Selena rotsuda 

Stooge Mcburger LaHaunt 

Xenophidex Nardieu  (he's been out for a few days, probably the best 1 to try for)

zechko 

Fancy Stars

He was in a bind 'cos he was way behind: he was willin' to make a deal.  
When he came across this young man flying a Rifter and running it hot.  
And The Mittani jumped up on a veldspar rock and said: ""Boy let me tell you what:  
""I bet you didn't know it, but I'm a Rifter pilot too.  
""And if you'd care to take a dare, I'll make a bet with you.  
""Now you fly pretty good solo, boy, but give a Goon his due:  
""I bet a region of gold against your soul, 'cos I think I'm better than you.""  
The boy said: ""My name's Boodabooda and it might be a sin,  
""But I'll take your bet, your gonna regret, 'cos I'm the best that's ever been.""  

Booda overheat your guns and fly that Rifter hard.  
'Cos Mittani's eyeing Fountain and the Goons cheat at cards.  
And if you win you get this shiny region full of gold.  
But if you lose, the Goons eat your soul!  

The Mittani loaded up his guns and said: ""I'll start this show.""  
And fire flew from his turret points as he streaked in fast and low.   
he overheats his microwarp and it makes an evil hiss.   
Then griefers smacked in local and it sounded something like this.  

(Griefer talk in background)  

When The Mittani finished, Booda said: ""Well you're pretty good ol' son.  
""But warp to that gate, right there, and let me show you how its done!""   

Focus on the primary, run boys, run!  
Goons are trying to ruin TESTies fun.  
Playing EVE like a job and purging your bros  
Why'd Goons become the next BoB?   
Damned if I know      

The Mittani bowed his head because he knew that he'd been beat.  
He laid that golden region on the grid at Booda's feet.  
Boodabooda said: ""Mittani just come on back if you ever want to try again.  
""I told you once, you backstabbing bitch, I'm the best that's ever been!""  

Focus on the primary, run boys, run!  
Goons are trying to ruin TESTies fun.  
Playing EVE like a job and purging your bros  
Can Goons win against TEST?  
""No, child, no.""

1364599703.0,249,self.Eve,1b9tyn,The best Dec Shield sob story,chiaco,306,57,102,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1b9tyn/the_best_dec_shield_sob_story/,"As leader of Dec Shield I received an amazing number of sob stories from victims of various crimes against humanity. This is the best of the stories I heard, set during the peak of highsec Incursion farming around a year ago.  
  
---------------  
  
  
One day I was convo'd by an incursion bear who had been brutally betrayed by an awoxer within his corp. The victim was seething mad and it took a while to work out the course of events that led to his downfall. All of which I'm about to share with you as a cautionary tale of lulz.  
  
  
About a year ago when incursions were released, they were given massive isk/hr rewards to encourage people to try out the new content. This led to farming multiple billions a day per character in highsec incursion groups. Which in turn led to multibox farming, and massive fleets of faction battleships/mauraders, etc.  
  
  
The story begins with an awoxing spy infiltrating one of these highsec incursion corps. Wasting no time, he undocks a normal battleship and finds a corpmate out in open space in a faction BS. He warp scrams him, nukes him down to oblivion, and pods the guy. No Concord response because he's a member of that corporation. -1 faction BS, -hundreds of millions in implants. He loots and salvages the wreck.  
  
  
The awox victim is shouting into comms at his other corpies to come avenge him. They're confused at what's going on, how could he be ganked in highsec without Concord protecting him they ask themselves? Another corp faction BS warps out to their staging spot, and is promptly tackled by the awoxer, who then proceeds to kill him. The pod escapes. -1 faction BS. He loots and salvages the wreck.  
  
  
The corp finally figures it out through all the yelling what's going on. ""BOOT HIM FROM CORP!"" ""WE CAN'T! IT WON'T LET US!"" They don't understand that if the player is online and in space that he cannot be booted from corp. Why do the game mechanics curse them so!?  
  
  
They gather their incursion fleet together and undock to go kill him. Afterall, blood can only be repaid with blood. The awoxer is still sitting there, waiting for them. He knows the game far better than them, and is about to prove it. The incursion fleet closes around him, tackling, webbing, dpsing. They have a full complement of logistics, and there's no way he can break their tank. Right as they're about to break his tank, 3 neutral logi come out of warp and begin repping him. Stalemate.  
  
  
How can he have logi repping him when we're trying to kill him? We'll just kill his logi and then him. A faction BS shoots one of the neutral logi... CONCORDOKKEN! -1 faction BS, -1 logi who was repping faction BS. He loots and salvages the wrecks. The Incursion bears are beside themselves with anger. Sputtering meaningless threats and struggling to hold back tears. Why is the game so unfair? Why will Concord defend him but not them! He must be a hacker! Off to go file a petition...  
  
  
Time passes. Enough time for the Concorded victims to reship and come back out to the field where they still have him pinned down. He's taunting them in local the whole time, blood pressures are still boiling. The awoxer knows he can't escape, and that he can't break any of their tanks with so many of their logi on field. He ejects from his ship and warps his pod out.  
  
  
The incursion bears are delighted, they're going to get to kill his battleship and reclaim their lost loot. But wait! Why destroy it when you can steal it! A faction BS boats to 0 on the empty hull and tries to board it. No success. They're confused why they can't board it. Must be a bug. The pilot ejects from his faction BS to try boarding it. The awoxer's pod warps back on to grid... boards the now empty faction BS. Warps it out before the corpies know what's going on. -1 stolen faction BS.  
  
  
HoW!? WHY?! IT'S NOT FAIR! The game does everything it can to benefit him and hurt us! They don't understand the ghost rider rules that prevent an empty ship from being boarded by someone other than the pilot while it's being targeted. They're all still on field, warp scramming and shooting his empty battleship. They WANT that loot back.  
  
  
He docks with the stolen faction BS. He drops corp. CONCORDOKKEN! The ENTIRE incursion fleet gets wiped out by Concord for shooting his now neutral empty battleship. All their logi get wiped out for repping pirates. He undocks in his pod, warps back to his battleship and boards it. He loots and salvages the entire field. At this point he had to eject ammo just so he could make room to continue to loot faction mods.  
  
  
The corpies are frothing at the mouth with rage. They will not be denied their vengeance. Taunting continues in local. Their comms are on fire and not a single coherent thought can be found amidst their impotent tears.  
  
  
He flies to the station they'd docked up in and sits on the undock. He taunts them in local about how generous they were to contribute all the faction loot to his personal reserves. They can't hold back the rage. They reship into another wave of whatever ships they have on hand to try one last attempt to gank him and reclaim their loot. They undock all at the same time. Concord is waiting for them. BLAP. Their entire fleet wiped out again. He loots and salvages them, again.  
  
  
They had never done highsec ganking before, and thus weren't aware of Concord rules. At this point the awoxer docks up and wishes them a pleasant evening and logs out for the night.

Anyways, here's a shoutout to all of you newbros and frustrated sandbox lovers that missed the original rush. We're open and taking in everyone and anyone who wants to hang out. If you looking for a group that knows what it's doing and is expertly organized, keep looking.

1333971658.0,246,self.Eve,s0ngi,I won a 100-man Battle Royale with a 2 billion ISK FoF Ferox,PallidumTreponema,289,43,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/s0ngi/i_won_a_100man_battle_royale_with_a_2_billion_isk/,"PL and NCdot had a joint Battle Royale, a free for all with tier1 battlecruisers. The rules were tier1 BCs, t2 fittings. No pirate implants, no boosters, no ECM and so on.

Knowing that in a free-for-all, my chances of survival would be slim to none, I decided to go for something somewhat unorthodox. My setup was a passive tanked HML ferox with FОFs loaded. I also carried a nos and a neut. The hull and mods cost me about 350 million‚ with thе T2 rіgs being 250 million аlonе - the rules didn't specify t1 rigs, so I shelled out for T2 rigs. I also bought both the 5% shield implants, at about 150 million each, and a bunch of faction FОF missiles at a cost of 250-350k ISK each! All in all‚ it was a vеry expensіve setup, thаt'd probably diе in a fire early on, but hey, if you gotta die, you gotta die. I also threw in a few other bits and pieces in the cargohold to make it a lovely killmail.

We arrived at the battlefield, about 100 pilots in total. The fleet was warped to a safespot and as soon as we landed, the fight was on. LadyScarlet was the first ship to explode, but with so much DPS clustered around a very small spot, ships were dying left and right. Since I had a bit of range with my missile launchers, I moved off from the immediate center of the blob and started circling at about 20-30km while popping rainbow damage FoF missiles like candy. Few people targetted me and those who did got hit by FoFs and were subsequently primaried as easy targets for going low in shields. I was doing okay so far.

Ships were dropping fairly quickly and by the mid-fight most of the armor tankers were gone. I was still doing well but by now there were lots of pods around that had warped out and back to observe. Unfortunately, the way FoF missiles work by shooting the closest target meant that unless someone aggressed on me, I was now in danger of accidentally shooting the pods. I closed in on the fight and as a result an ncdot cyclone (tylr) decided to go for me. He closed on me and his short range meant that he was now taking the brunt of my FoFs. He did, however, deal a significant amount of damage on me as well, and my shields dropping meant that more and more people started shooting me. At about 60% shields, I overheated my invulns while still blasting away at Tylr. Both my neut and nos were on him and I think he realised this as he pulled off. Our fight had also gotten him into low shields, catching the attention of the other brawlers and there were calls on teamspeak to shoot both him and me. I was doing better than him, but I still dropped down to 20% shields by the time he popped. I had long since changed my target to the small swarm of drones pecking away at my shields in an effort to reduce the incoming DPS. Fortunately, others had noticed that Tylr was losing shields and helped finishing him off. At this point, I was out of cap and both my invulns were almost burned out. Only the purchase of 300 million ISK worth of shield hardwirings had provided me the extra bit of tank to survive that fight.

With Tylr gone, my shields regenerated quickly and a nearby ferox was kind enough to lend me cap by means of my lone nos. At this point, there were only about 20 ships left, and I think a lot of PL decided at the same time to take out the remaining NCdot targets that were outnumbering us - about 15 NCdot to half that number of surviving PL pilots. Any NCdot ship that dropped into low shields got primaried and eliminated as the sharks tasted blood. The process was slow, however, as most of the surviving ships were tankfit with little DPS. At this point, I finally launched my drones to help out - I didn't launch them earlier, as I didn't want to lose them unnecessarily.

The additional DPS didn't last long, however, as Elise fleetwarped the entire fleet to another location - the FFA had spead the combattants out to the extent that a fleetwarp was needed to bring them back into close range. I didn't pull in my drones in time, which meant that 100 of my 213 DPS total were left behind. Whoops. Still, I took this opportunity to repair my overheated modules.

With only a few ships remaining, I had to switch to non-FОF missiles in order to try to focus my limited DPS. If I recall correctly‚ thеre were just a few more PL than NCdot on the fіeld, аnd thе NCdot ships were taken out one by one. With only PL remaining, and all of them in heavily tanked feroxes, any ship that took damage would end up being primaried by the rest. I took advantage of this by ensuring that once a primary had reached armor, I picked a new target and shot its shields down so that it'd be the next primary instead of me. Оne by one‚ slowly, ships poppеd and we ended up wіth five remаining ships.

A passivеly tanked ferox can easily tank 600 DPS, but with missiles it can only do about 120 DPS. Perhaps we could've killed one more ship, but after that the feroxes would outtank any incoming DPS. Fortunately, RZR decided to help us out by moving in with a gang about 40 strong. It was decided to brawl it out and the last ship to die would win the battle royale.

In a normal fight, this might've been a bad decision, but this was the battle royale. I made a quick call - start shooting off frigates while heading straight away from the RZR gang. By luck and manuvering, RZR seemed to call primaries by distance, and my ship, having motored off from the RZR fleet, was the last to explode in a fiery death.

And that's the tale of how the 2 billion ISK FОF ferox won the battle royale.

Naturally they look for advice, but with all the information available, new players often end up no less confused. 

This guide is intended to be read and digested in 15 minutes, and it is intended to help new players to find a direction for the first few weeks. It doesn't address the technical questions; plenty of guides already do that. Instead it tackles the fuzzier questions that don't have single answers.



**Step 1**

Get a trial account, then if you're still interested after 2 weeks, get a 3 month subscription. 3 months is plenty of time to see what EVE has to offer without spending more than you would on an off-the-shelf game.



**Step 2**

Choose your starting race purely on aesthetics and lore. While the starting skills are slightly different, with just a few hours of skill training you can have any other race's starting skills.



**Step 3**

Do the tutorials! Follow them up with the Servant Sisters of EVE epic arc, the Blood Stained Stars.

They give excellent starting capital, including decent ISK, a range of frigates and a destroyer, and enough standing with all the factions to run level 2 missions rather than levels 1s (more rewards and they get you to even higher level missions faster). They also, naturally, run you through many of the tasks you'll want to do in-game.



While doing Step 3, which will take a few afternoons, also do the following 3 steps: 

**Step 4**

Join the EVE University public channel in-game (E-UNI), where there are lots of players happy to answer questions, and bookmark their wiki, which is amazingly comprehensive. (http://wiki.eveuniversity.org) Both are incredible resources even for non-members. The wiki also has a much more comprehensive starting guide.

[Joining a channel: In the upper right corner of the chat window, just below the ""minimize"" button is speech cloud button that says ""open channel window"". Click it, then in the box under ""channels"" type the name of the channel you want, and finally click ""join.""]



**Step 5**

Find a starting corp; it doesn’t have to be permanent. EVE is far more fun as a social game than a single-player game. Here are some good options:

[NO CORP WORTH YOUR TIME WILL ASK FOR ISK OR ITEMS TO JOIN! IF THEY DO, IT'S A SCAM. Most will provide you, the applicant, with resources for joining.]

[When applying, familiarize yourself with EVE Mail: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/EVE_mail]

**EVE University** (public channel: E-Uni):
http://www.eveuniversity.org/

Plusses: Comprehensive with a vast support network and generally well regarded by the community. Excellent support for both combat and non-combat professions.

Minuses: Fairly long application process and restrictive war-time rules.

Note: Despite their reputation in some corners, they do PVP. They just aren't focused on it like the other corps listed here are.


**Open University of Celestial Hardship** (public channel: OUCH-UNI) [Full disclosure, I'm a student here; enjoying it, but in no way a representative for them]:
http://ouch.artofwar-alliance.com/

Plusses: Accepts everyone, relatively quick set of classes that still give an excellent introduction to PVP. Followed by doing small gang PVP with them and an extended, solo roam final test.

Minuses: No classes in PVE or non-combat professions (though their players are happy to give advice). Somewhat restrictive rules for students who haven't completed certain classes, but getting done with the classes can be done in a few weekends.


**Flying Dangerous** (public channel: FD 4 PVP):
http://forums.figl-alliance.com/index.php

Plusses: Get you out into null-sec, small gang PVP right away. Still newbie friendly, though; learn by doing.

Minuses: No structured classes, no support for non-combat roles or PVE.


**RvB** (public channel: R-V-B):
https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;m=24444&amp;#post24444

Plusses: Lots of PVP in high-sec with a low investment. Very beginner accessible. Their Ganknights are open to all and a blast. Ship replacement available, despite being an open corp.

Minuses: High-sec PVP doesn't prepare you for low and null-sec PVP. Also, while their community is very supportive and fun, they don't offer classes.


**Goonswarm** (if you're active on Something Awful)

**Dreddit** (if you're an active Redditor) https://wiki.pleaseignore.com/wiki/Joining_Dreddit

**FWeddit** (Redditors in Faction Warfare)

(They recruit through their respective websites, not in-game. If you're not active on their home websites and they offer to let you join, you either have an IRL friend in their corp already who's recommending you OR IT'S A SCAM.)

Plusses: You get out to secured null-sec right away. (The money-making opportunities of null-sec while being even safer than high-sec, unless they shoot friendlies for fun.) You also get to take part in big, nay, HUGE fleet fights. They are incredibly well resourced and incredibly welcoming and supportive of new players. Many of EVE's most epic tales involve them in starring roles.

Minuses: The player culture is a bit sophomoric. Sure, they aren't all like that, but you have to be able to tolerate people who are.

Feel free to post other options in the comments below, but again, be careful of scams.



**Step  6**

Train the following sets of skills (not in any particular order, balance them):

- Fitting skills (such as electronics, engineering, rigging, upgrades, etc.)
- Social skills (negotiation, connections, social; you only need to take them to level 3 at the beginning to improve your income from missions, a simple, reliable revenue stream for a new player)
- A given race's ships and their appropriate weapon and tanking skills. 

The races:

Gallente - drones, short-range blasters, armor tanking

Caldari - missiles, long-range railguns, shield tanking, slow

Amarr - LAZORS, short and long-range, some drones and missiles, armor tanking, somewhat slow

Minmatar - guns, short and long range, fast, versatile, a little of everything

When in doubt, go Minmatar.

All the races are worthwhile, but the Minmatar have strong ships in all of the early classes (frigates through battlecruisers, and industrials), and their ships are versatile. They allow you to try out the major classes of weapons (gunnery, both long and short ranged, missiles, and drones) and the three methods of tanking (speed, armor, and shields). They also have the second best mining cruiser (the Scythe) and the second best industrial (the Mammoth) in the game, letting you try out non-combat professions.

In short, when it comes to trying everything, the Minmatar can't be beat. By skilling for their ships you can easily cross-train with the other, more specialized races in areas you find appealing. The drawback of this flexibility is that you have to train a wider range of skills to use their ships to the fullest.



**Step 7**

After you've done all the above, try out small gang PVP while also running missions, salvaging, trading, mining, industry, ratting, and/or exploration to pay the bills. This is the heart of the game, and the most common overall play-style. There are plenty of other niches, which you should try and may end up preferring, but if you don't like this core lifestyle, EVE probably isn't your game.

Beyond that, explore, experiment, meet people, die in a fire, make other people die in a fire, make asteroids die in a fire if that's your thing, but above all, have fun.

(Two decisions not to sweat: what NPC corp to grind standings with first (if you're a mission runner) and what system to base yourself in. There's plenty of time to figure these out, and the best answer will change with your circumstances.)


**Appendix: Valuable Resources to Have from the Start:**

 **3 Rules to enjoying EVE:**

1. Don't fly/buy/loan/build what you can't afford to lose. (In many MMO's, people buy that shiny item the moment they have just enough gold to do so. In EVE this is a very bad idea. Invest in things when you know how to use them properly and can afford to replace them.)

2. Trust no one. People will stab you in the back, scam you, and blow you up for fun. Luckily, dying in a fire is fun.

3. Do unto others.  Doing all those things listed above to other people is even more fun than having them done to you.

If WoW is Disney World, highly safe, saccharine, and precisely orchestrated fun, then EVE is a roadside carnival. It's a bit rickety, has as many scams as it does honest fun, has a seedy underbelly poking up above the surface (blatantly in some cases), but is all the more thrilling because it always feels like it's about to come apart at the seams.

Yes, the real mining fleet with one orca, one noctis, a bunch of industrials, ventures and procurers.

Formup in lowsec outgate:

http://i.imgur.com/NGToMrP.png

-----

Orca was used as a flagship keeping loot and mining hobgoblins. Ventures were scouts/dronebunnies, industrials as long-range dps, and Procurers used as droneboats and ""fast tackle"".

I know that frigates are supposed to be tacklers, but procurers actually have pretty decent scan resolution, so they managed to warp scramble asteroids and their pods.

On the way to 0.0 orca always jumped first, and mining fleet followed.  But we didn't even make it out to 0.0 when evil CVA Armaggedon attacked poor ""little"" orca on a lowsec gate. Mining fleet came to the rescue, and another CVA battleship joined the battle.

Evil CVA Armaggeddon:

I just love these killmails... Anyway...

We jumped to 0.0, and another evil CVA battleship was waiting on the outgate bubble with smartbombs. I thought it's against CVA policy to drop bubbles? Anyway, procurors were holding just fine when industrials were mining this battleship from 10k orbit. But for dozen of poor ventures this roam was ended.

Evil CVA Typhoon:

Everyone knows that provi defenders really good at solo bombing. How hard it could be? Uncloak 30 km from a target, launch a bomb, and then pick a celestial to warp off. This way at least one ship on the field will be destroyed.

As I said, one and only one ship was destroyed in that bombing run:

http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=19165571

After having a good laugh over these killmails, we went to deep provi looking for asteroids and other miners. Ventures were sent to each asteroid belt looking for them while fleet was waiting on gate and welcoming everyone who is passing by.

This welcoming party surely has a lot of cargo space for your loot:

So let's make a list. Post here and I'll update the post. ~~Starting with the ones I use:~~ List is updated with all shortcuts people posted in the comments:

Shit + Click on module = overheat

F = Drones engage current target

Shift + R = Recall drones

Alt+C = opens inventory

Alt+R = opens market

Alt+F = fitting

Ctrl + W = closes active window

Ctrl + Tab = Cycles through open windows (not useful, but cool)

Ctrl+Click in the overview = locks target

Q+click in overview = approach

W+click in overview = orbit

E+click in overview = keep at range

D = Jump/Dock

Ctrl + f9 - hide ui a.k.a eve online - beautymode!

Ctrl-Space - stop ship

Ctrl + Shift + Click = Unlock target

Alt-X = training queue

A + click = align

S + click = warp

Alt + Arrow key - Switch between targets. I think be default left and right are inversed, so you might want to hunt them down and change it, if this bugs you, like it did me.

Function key (F1, F2, etc.) - Use High slot items

Alt + Function key - Use mid slot items

Ctrl + Function key - Use low slot items

Double click - Move ship in that direction. Good for if you are trying to approach a large amount of things, but don't want to take the time to pickout the center most object.

Tab - Minimize all windows. Useful if you are being targeted/attacked, but can't tell which direction it's coming from.

Alt + M1 (left click) - Center cameras on an object. This is useful in both PvP, if you are trying to identify specific ship fittings, or Mining Ops so two characters don't both mine the same rock. Note: this can get a little glitchy if you continually switch back and forth between alt+M1 on objects in the overview pane and alt+M1 in space, so try to stick with one or the other.

Alt + D - Open D-scan.

F10 - Star map

T + click = show info 

C - Toggle on/off camera tracking

Alt+shift+x shows moon brackets

I’ve always had a great admiration of the logistics role especially watching during the Alliance Tournaments but I’ve always been intimidated to try it, in case I screw up and cause us all to pop.

But I grew a pair last night when the call came to form a frigate fleet and I readily purchased and fit an Inquisitor for the excursion, I knew I was going to be instaprimaried and popped but a small part of me was hopeful that I could make a difference in the battle before that.

Warped to the forming up point and already before we started I see our FC needed a couple of rep cycles, so I lock him and up dutifully oblige, much to the surprise of the fleet who had no idea I was bringing a logi - Nobody expects the Repping Inquisitor?! 

We jump into a system and get action right away on the gate, I’ve no idea what the heck to do so I just hope someone broadcasts that they need armor, luckily I decide to pre-lock some people I think that are going to be obvious primaries and it works, a punisher is getting a beating and for the next 5 glorious seconds I’m repping him back to full armor, much to the amusement and delight of our fleet, the opposing team unable to break the reps, I am a god amongst men! No-one can stop the Repping Inquisitor! I control who lives and who di…..

Aaaand I’m in my pod, well that didn’t last long, but as I warp away back to station I hear on fleet voice that we win the fight and get thanks from the fleet for being the little Inquisitor that could.

Although brief, it’s the most fun I’ve had in Eve for a few weeks, consider me converted to the world of logistics.

1375064530.0,232,self.Eve,1j91sm,BR 6VDT,Vily_R,287,55,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1j91sm/br_6vdt/,"Today ladies and gentlemen we saw the largest engagement in the history of video games.

I say that because a battle of over Four thousand pilots is now over, with the embers of our enemies wrecks still smoldering (even though they cannot) in the cold dark of the space of the 6VDT-H solar system in the Fountain region of space.

This battle is the culmination of what will likely be the fountain war, a war that has raged for two months and represents one of the more dynamic conflicts of eve-online in the last two years.

When we (the CFC or clusterfuck coalition) decided to reinforce the 6VDT-H station we did so merely on a whim, TEST Alliance, had shown an unacceptable level of resistance to one of daily euro timezone siege groups and thus the farther you let us push the farther we shall push. In a suprising turn of events TEST Alliance decided to time the station timer for European prime (afternoon USTZ) instead of the usual Australian timezone strategy which has while providing little success in the past, at least allowed them to resist at a moderate level.

We didn't even particularly think much of the timer, 6VDT-H is not anywhere near the strategic level it used to be, its use as a transit hub is mostly diminished and it no longer represents an active military base for more than a fraction of TEST's forces. However the morning after the initial attack we awoke to a suprise, all TEST operations for the following two days had been cancelled. All forces were to prepare for a defence of 6VDT on Sunday the 28th of July. This was where they would hold the line, this was where they would end our advance.

So we in the CFC prepared, as we do for all operations. We analyzed the locations and time, we organized our allies and membership. We were told that TEST Alliance with their returning allies N3/Nulli, aka (N3ST) would make a stand, this would be their Alamo. We found weaknesses. N3ST's moon control was lacking, allowing us with moderate effort the day before to gain complete moon supremacy, insuring that there would be no high ground for N3ST to fall back to, limiting their options if the would chose to deploy supercapital class assets into the fight. Preparation and organization is a hallmark of CFC strategy and for a battle as important as this no opportunity for advantage would be passed up.

The morning of the fight we had some chats, but the FC group in charge of the CFC war machine are old dogs for this type of fight, we know the mechanics of herding our people, moving them at best speed, and getting there to the desination in best order. Before a single broadcast had gone out 2300 people sat ready in 4-EP the CFC staging base. More would login over the course of the day. The N3ST staging systems, amassed just under two thousand pilots, leaving them slightly outnumbered, but not by a margin anywhere as small as we had expected.

The CFC war machine drummed, and Seven fleets of 256 ( the max allowable) Megathrons were formed, under the following commanders. Vily, Mister Vee, Lazarus Teleraven, Reaglan, Cor Six, Intergalaktor, Ironwulf. Two fleets of bombers under Kcolor and Dabigredboat were formed and an electronic warfare fleet under David Cedarbridge. Also a mobile armor heavy assault cruiser group under imperian, going after smaller groups in a shark hunter role. That does not even include the large number of capital ships that were formed under Theadj. When all was said and done, within an hour of sounding the horn, over 2200 pilots had moved into fleets and began the process of preparing for the fight.

The forces of N3ST however were not sitting idly by, while I am not privy to all their formation information i do know they formed 2 fleets of prophecy class battlecruisers, a pair of Armor Heavy assault cruiser fleets, an electronic warfare fleet, a dominix class battleship fleet and other fleets of bombers and assorted cruiser and frigate class ships. also notably a ""gokufleet"" of stealthbombers that went to 4-EP instead of the main battle to intercept our reinforcements.

Moving such a mass of forces is an extremely unique aspect of eve-online, moving a single 256 man fleet can be a challenge at times, moving 8 of them at once can be even more so. Time dilation generally can kick in anytime you see 300 or more pilots moving as a group, moving 1000+ is a surety. As such CFC formed almost two hours in advance of the reinforced timer exiting invulnerable mode. It is not fun, but it is absolutely necessary if you plan to acheive system control first, giving you a significant tactical advantage. As such almost 1 hour before the timer approached we had entered system and moved into a position around the station, evenly orbiting with several fleets, providing ourselves a position almost entirely immune to hostile bomber fleets.

Most of our pilots took advantage of this time to get lunch, say goodbye to their families and prepare for the worst while expecting the best. At the same time N3ST forces slowly moved through the process of moving their forces into a position to engage. This process is slow and arduous and it was obvious that they were playing against the clock to organize themselves properly to arrive in time to contest the system.

At approximately 5 minutes left of the station timer, hostile cynosural fields were spotted in system and the enemy (N3ST) forces took titan bridges into system. It's hard to describe the sense of anticipation one feels when preparing for something of this epic scale and certainly the pulse of myself and many other of the fleet commanders rose, the fight was coming, IT WAS HAPPENING.

Our position on that station is the best equivalent to a proper formation in eve i can describe, with each member of each fleet orbiting a single point (the station) we create a spherical wall with roughly a 80km edge from side to side. Spread out this much we are almost entirely invulnerable to bombers, while at the same time being within range from both sides for our megathron guns of any target that comes at us. This was the stance we chose and doign so surrounding the enemy station, the ball was in their court. Come to us we said, and they had to, so they did.

The fight, like most fights, never happened as the N3ST forces would have wished, a bomber group under dabigredboat started the fight by inititating a bombrun against one of the hostile fleets, forcing them to stay in position or warped to their only aligned point... the station. Rather than accept their instant destruction under a wave of bombs, they took the next worse choice, engage warp, prepare to fight. Rather than let their comrades die alone, several of the other test fleets engaged warp as well. Theere was no going back now.

The first fleet to land was a segment of the electronic warfare group avoiding the bombrun, but it would be followed in such close succession by prophecy and Armor HAC groups that it could have hardly been more than a minute where they took fire alone. NOW we were truly engaged. Fire was exchanged and the massive groups of railguns carried by the megathron fleets spun into action. At the same time the prophecy groups began dropping and assisting their sentry drones and focusing their massive salvo's of damage.

As the CFC often does in these type of fights, as any commander of unscrupulous morales would do given the chance, we headshotted their leaders. Damnation commandships and Heavily armored interdiction cruisers were the brunt of our attack and under the fire of a thousand megathrons there is no force in eve that can withstand our guns. Armored to the nines to insure survival and allow a functional chain of command among the N3ST forces, their plan failed. All the leaders of the N3st forces we could identify, were targeted and summarily executed, while this is only a stopgap measure in eve, you cannot truly kill their characters it does move those leaders off the field and back to their staging systems and make controlling their fleets near impossible. Leaderless, one of the Armor HAC groups proceeded to do almost no damage for the next two hours. Some of the other fleets, more prepared for our engagement tactics were not as hindered.

The N3ST forces chose to employ the same tactic, attemptting to kill Cor Six and Mister Vee, leaders of their respective Megathron fleets. Neither would fall, the enemy forces focus not equal to our own, wasting precious salvo's onto plated armor that would not break.

The large number of stealth bombers in system would begin to take its toll upon the n3st forces as well now. Dabigredboat and Kcolor both landed successful bombrun upon enemy fleets, DBRB on the core of the primary prophecy fleet and kcolor upon the electronic warfare group, both destroying or damaging heavily.

The mobile fleet of the CFC under imperian is now collecting its skulls as well, controlling the only exit to the system, all those that would attempt to fleet from the carnage would meet their fate even sooner than those that would choose to stay and fight.

The dominix fleet of N3 a bit late began briding into system at a safespot away from the fight, it would be plagued by disconnects and losses of critical personel for quite a while.

The Nulli ( a component of N3) goku stealth bomber fleet that had setup a camp to interdict stragglers from our staging system of 4-ep is almost entirely destroyed by the infamous multiclient hero oodell. 80 pilots are defeated by one, as in a bitter turn of fate, 8 stealth bombers can just as easily dispatch 80.

The fight is ongoing on the station, Hostiles are attempting to inflict damage upon megathrons and we in turn are focusing on the expensive but highly armored Legion class strategic cruisers. we are making progress but it is slow and time consuming, the time dilation means it can take almost 5 minutes to down a single cruiser, several catch remote repairs and are saved even amidst the overwhelming fire.

The legion group being weakened and burnt, a significant four of the seven Megathron fleets turn their fire upon the prophecy groups, damage from earlier bombs, accompanied by their larger size and thus easier to track ships allows us to greatly increase the speed at which we are dispatching hostile ships.

The much large N3 dominix fleet is now asserting control over the single exit gate, forcing imperian's small more mobile Armor HAC group off.

At this point we make the call to ""drop the hammer"". Our capital class vessels, waiting in the wings for the first 2 hours of the fight, come into play, with bright lights and whooshing sounds. 200 Capitals represent equal firepower if not more, to the entire force of megathrons we already have on the field.

Immediatly upon see'ing our capitals come into play, N3ST forces begin to prepare their evac, singular fleets begin to warp away leaving other to their cold grim fate. with control of the exit gate provided by the dominix group they also have a long, but somewhat safe path to freedom. However anytime you retreat in eve-online there is a price to pay and 10-20% of your fleet being caught is usually an accurate level. 10-20% of 2000 however is near 200 pilots trapped in interdiction gravity sphere's preventing their escape. Preventing any chance of getting away alive.

And so we would we enact our butchers bill, slaughtering all those who could not run, who were not fast enough in their retreat.

As we continue to clear the battlefield killing everything but the most difficult to track of frigates, word comes in of... something odd in eve. It seems that TEST Alliance plans to make a charge, a last stand, to come back in, against overwhelming force and make a statement. In eve this is not done, you do not fight when there is no hope, you retreat and save your ships for another day, another chance. But in they came, and while i can safely say i was suprised i was also a little sad that so much bravery would have to be killed so quickly.

Their suicide run would kill a single Naglfar class dreadnaught. Over two hundred pilots would pay the price for it. On a good day 10 capitals might be worth that price, but not today.

With the field finally cleared after eight hours of combat, with the hostile fleets finally retreating or disbanded (save a small harassment bomber group) we bridged our fleets back to 4-ep, and called it a day.

That is the fight of 6VDT from my eyes, it was long, it was grueling and it was large. ",,False,,t5_2qil9,False,,,True,t3_1j91sm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1j91sm/br_6vdt/,

Fine.,Prometheus09,287,59,132,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1k2l96/how_much_to_make_you_leave_15_billion_isk_fine/,"So about a month ago I saw a reddit post of a Test Pilot who was bombing interceptors as they tried to tackle him and I thought, that looks fun, lets do this. So after a few practice runs with an alt (and unwilling members of my corp) I headed down to Providence with an alt in a Manticore.   


I spent the first couple of days just flying around Providence making bookmarks until I entered the fateful system of G-B22J, the home of Care Factor Alliance. Now this system was a pretty big mining hub so I figured if I shot a couple of miners they would put up a defense fleet including interceptors and I could try and bomb them, so I decided to stay for a few days. 


While most of the miners would dock up, a few were not going to let a hostile stop them from gathering all the minerals they could. As such I decided to shoot them, while initially I didn’t have much luck in killing them it did seem to aggravate them a little. 



    gg202 &gt; really fuct tard
    gg202 &gt; come back and try again

    gg202 &gt; Bombamanthat your alt looser
    gg202 &gt; wow place a bount worth something



He then placed a 10mill bounty on my head so I requested every one in alliance to put a bounty on his head. 

    gg202 &gt; was that all the isk you could afrod after buying the account web hacker
    gg202 &gt; wow had to log in all your alts fuck head
    gg202 &gt; keep it coming
    gg202 &gt; more intel for me
    gg202 &gt; your entire copr fuck head

    gg202 &gt; damn your mommy forgot to change your diapper
    gg202 &gt; your smelling up the place
    gg202 &gt; or did your mom run out of prozac


So after this little exchange I thought I might stay around a little longer and see if I could get any more tears. Over the next few days I got a couple hauler kills while they were doing PI, fired some bombs at small gangs that came thought the system and generally just watched them. What they didn’t really appreciated was the 23/7 camping. 



    EVE System &gt; Channel changed to Local : G-B22J
    eldeago &gt; Fishy Night ever hear of replicator?
    eldeago &gt; he was the last person to perma camp us, and he is now banned from the game, your pushing it.



    EVE System &gt; Channel changed to Local : G-B22J

    gg202 &gt; Fishy Night did your mommy give you a note so you can play in null sec again
    gg202 &gt; did she change your diaper before coming



Furthermore they started to ask me to shoot them.  

    [07:26:40] gg202 &gt; you Fishy Night un latcth your mouth from your moter tit and come and try and claim some of your bounty back
    [20:30:56] karmeer &gt; Fishy Night I'm bored, come and throw some bombs at me
    [20:31:27] Soirseta &gt; mommy hasnt let him out of the play pen
    [20:31:27] No Pressure &gt; no, not him please! let it me to be bombed =)



What really tempted me to stay a little longer though was the thought of ganking one of their 20 man mining fleets they would run, while I was in system, with a small defense fleet to ensure I didn’t try anything. But what that defense fleet wasn’t going to stop was my corporation deciding to leave our wormhole to BLOPS them. 
So over the next week I continued to watch them getting a kill every now and then and even losing my Manticore to bait a couple of times. Unfortunately on the day of the op, they didn’t have a mining fleet out, so we dropped ontop of a ratting fleet instead.

This also gave rise to the question why was I here? Why was I shooting  them? What had they done to deserve this?

    [00:55:37] Maddax Mcloud &gt; We'd just like to know what triggered this, since it seems quite personal, witht he 23 hour a day camping and all
    [00:55:38] Rook Cavender &gt; We thought for sure you were freeloading
    [01:16:08] Fishy Night &gt; what can I say
    [01:16:15] Fishy Night &gt; you guys kept asking me to shoot you

Over the next couple of weeks I got some kills, lost another couple of Manticore’s, and just watched the population G-B22J get less and less and their development indices decease. I was then told to leave system. This probably came about because a good Eve friend also joined me in camping their systems.

So they finally came to the conclusion that I must have been heird to camp them (by the Alliance next door mind you). And there is only one way to remove a person who has been hired and that is outbid the original contractor.

Maybe you're interested in trying EVE out for yourself?

Cool!  The fight you saw on the front page was a little out of the ordinary, but that doesn't mean the rest of the game isn't fun.

There's a lot to learn, a lot to do, and a lot to be wary of.

But first things first.  You want to start playing EVE online!

If you don't have an account head here: www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1ghkpz/21_day_trial_thread/?sort=new - and help a bro out by using their code.  If you PM them they may split some of the isk (in-game money) they receive from you signing up!  (Or PM me and I'll send you mine!)

So you've downloaded the client and are ready to start playing?

Sweet, make yourself a goofy looking character so that everyone will fume at how stupid you look as you blow up their internet spaceship!

Go through the tutorials - They're long and a bit clunky.  But invaluable.  Do it, you'll receive lots of free things and start to grasp how vast and wide EVE really is.


So... You've finished the tutorial and have no idea what the fuck to do next...

Start going to some of the newbie friendly player-run corporations located here on reddit!

I'm part of /r/fweddit

But /r/Bravenewbies are excellent for a newbro like yourself

and /r/evedreddit are a major alliance in EVE and have quite a few thousand members.

Both /r/fweddit and /r/evedreddit were both involved in that massive battle last night.  /r/evedreddit represents the core of TEST alliance who gallantly defended their space in that huge clusterfuck on the front page.  We in /r/fweddit played a supporting role (I tasked my fleet, all other players, to kill certain beacons that allowed TEST to bring in reinforcements!)

Take a look at /r/evejobs for other corps recruiting.  If you're more interested in Mining, Trading, Industry, Exploring the galaxy, there will be a corp in your timezone out there for you!

Corporations are how people organise in EVE - They are a core part of the game play and give an excellent sense of community to everything in the game.  Corps are what keep people playing and coming back day after day.

Everything you see in game is generated and made possible by other players.  Everyone on field last night in that huge battle was another person.  No bots, no NPCs - All people.

Start lurking /r/eve and browse the sidebar for good information.  Never be afraid to ask stupid questions.  Even some of the most powerful and influential people in EVE were newbros at some point.

EVE is amazing, fun, frustrating, glorious and interesting.  Sign up, try it out, start making your own story.

EDIT: I just want to clear up, that I'm only trying to promote EVE, not a specific corp.

After taking some advice from the nice people that replied mostly telling me to HTFU :P I ended up joining Brave newbies.

After joining a fleet defending hek we headed out for a little low-sec roam where I got to experience 30+ ships aligning an object and fleet warping(coolest thing ever)and tackling my first ship that led to a kill.

While waiting on a gate for our scout to do his job a Tornado warped at 150km off gate and started sniping some of our ships I immediately started burning towards him at a slight angle so he couldn't blop me. As I'm approaching the enemy ship the fc shouts out ""incursus you're our only hope"" at that precise moment it starts to sink in that about 30 fleet mates are depending on me. Luckily I am able to warp scram him and then the FC calls everyone to warp on top of me and we end up taking him down quite fast.

http://zkillboard.com/detail/28423689/

After the kill the FC asks for my name and congratulates me and jokingly asks people to give me isk for that tackle but a few very nice people actually do donate me around 20m isk paying my next few thrashers for fleet ops.

TL;DR: I get my first tackle on a 150m isk tornado at 150km from gate. I get congratulated. Feels great.",,False,,t5_2qil9,1360726993.0,,,True,t3_18aj9o,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/18aj9o/now_this_is_eve/,

How I created content.,guppshouse,257,33,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1jzqfp/industrialist_to_vigilante_how_i_created_content/," I was a huge fan of the first few years of Star Wars Galaxies, but after it was patched to death, nothing else really filled that space.  It always fascinated me and made me long for another game where your actions had consequences and the economy was a living, breathing entity. 

There were other MMOs, but in the end they felt empty and static. I missed the rush of having to look over your shoulder as you made your way through the world because a bounty hunter could jump out from anywhere, hellbent on placing your head on a stake and cashing in. 

I started playing EVE 4 years ago off and on for a month at a time, subscribing for a month every time some scam or war hit the mainstream media. I loved it every time I logged in. I started mining as so many do. In my case it was an attempt at regaining the glory of SWG where I played a very successful armor smith. I would again become an industrial mogul!

In the end I never stuck around for more than a month. Mostly due to the fact I never applied to a corp and treated it as a single player game I think.  It never left my thoughts though. Always lurking at the back of my mind that I was missing out on something. 

A year ago that changed. I'm not sure what media story it was this time, but I found myself once again entering my credit card details and activating my account. I got into a great new player friendly corp and have been subscribed ever since, although the corp has changed.

Time goes by, and much as in SWG, as the ISK piles up doing trading and manufacturing, you start to look for other things to do, things to spend your earnings on, something exciting. In SWG you tried to unlock a Jedi, in EVE you start an alt. 

My alt was going to be a combat pilot. No pussyfooting around Jita with market orders, no hauling this or that, calculating profit margins or speculating on the price of nano transistors. I wanted guns, missiles and spaceships that went BOOM! on my screen. Maybe even in time take part in the happenings in null sec that has made EVE famous. 

I made my alt and applied to one of the large new player friendly PvP corps. I had a blast, sucking in all the combat knowledge that had passed me by sitting in Jita for 6 months. Slowly but surely I was gaining an understanding for all the mechanics involved. I didn't play my alt that much the first few months, preferring to wait until he was ready to proficiently use something bigger than a frigate. Core Competency Standard anyone?

When I did play though I was loving the tactics, comms, the anticipation and especially when the other guy went BOOM! I also gained a healthy respect for FCs and how they make a plan come together. I love it when a plan comes together. 

You read this far? Well here comes the point. 

A friend of mine told me he had been carrying to much cargo in his hauler the other day and a Tornado had popped him as he approached a gate.  He wasn't angry at anyone but himself for trying to haul a small fortune through space, but it is frustrating, I've been ganked myself a few times and could empathize. There was a difference this time though. I thought ""I can get revenge""!

2 things had changed since I got ganked myself almost a year earlier. I had an understanding of the Kill Rights system and I had my now deadly alt.  By this time he was quite proficient in anything up to battle cruiser and skilled in a wide variety of weapons. 

Excitement grew in me as I set out to, for the first time really, create my own content that would directly affect another. One of us would have their Internet spaceship turned to pixels of space dust, I was sure of it. 

My plan was initially simple. Locate the Tornado pilot who had suicide ganked my friend, roll up to him in a superior ship and hope his skills didn't overcome my theoretical advantage. 

I started playing the meta game, crawling through kill boards looking at his records. There was a pattern. The ship type he used and the systems he operated in repeated themselves. I just needed to find out about his fitting so I could tell what kind of numbers I would have to beat. A suicide gank does not however generate a loss mail I quickly learned. Thankfully though, a month or two ago, someone in a Velator got a shot off on him as he was being concorded after a gank. I got my look at his fit and hoped he hadn't changed it much since. I was very happy when I saw, unsurprisingly, that his Tornado was tank free. I had suspected as much, but now I knew. 

Now to find him. He was already in my contacts and I had added him to my watch list, so I knew he was online. I had heard of locator agents, but never used them. Some quick reading and I understood that my mains Industrialist research partners, with which I have a very good relationship, at the Lai Dai Corporation would come in handy. A quick visit to their agent and 10 minutes later I had a location.

Now for the tricky bit. How to ensure the kill. I was sure I could just jump around the gates in the system he was in and I'd see him, but judging from his fit he would be 70km or so off gate. If I burned to him from the gate he would know something was up. I decided I'd use both my characters. I'd take my Industrialist out in a cloaky frigate, sneak up to him, and use him as a warp in for my lethal alter ego to land right on top of him. 

The last thing that had to be done was to decide with which blunt instrument I would bludgeon this sneaky sniper with. Now in EVE, as far as blunt instruments go, a Thorax with blasters seemed to fit the bill. Short range, high damage, dead sniper. His 1400mm artillery wouldn't stand a chance at hitting me while my blasters chewed through his paper thin hull. 

I had my plan and was getting very excited.  I slept on it for a night. Then it was time. 

Locator agent,check.

Characters in place, check. 

Roam gates to pinpoint sniper...eh...wtf.

My sniper was nowhere to be found. Not docked up, not on grid of any gates. I hadn't anticipated this at all. 

Dscan. I had used Dscan a little before in some PvP fleets and when searching for a free moon to put up a POS and thought maybe it could help me again. The system I was in wasn't that much bigger than Dscans range, so there was hope. I fired up a scan and immediately it returned a hit for a Tornado. I was so happy! It didn't have to be him, but I had something to go on. 

It took me 10-15 minutes, using range and the angle of the scan I narrowed down the position. He was sitting off grid from one of the gates. I wasn't sure on how far, but a Tornado sitting still in a safe spot off a gate where I knew he had killed several targets. It had to be him!

I needed a new plan of attack. I would have to scan him down to find him and my industrialist doesn't scan anything except market prices and the occasional exotic dancer. He was out of the picture then. It would be a one man job. 

My gung-ho alter ego hadn't actually scanned down anyone either before, but I figured it couldn't be that much different from scanning anomalies and I've done plenty of that. Looking at the blunt instrument I was spinning around in my hangar I also came to the conclusion I would need to ship up. I could not fit a scanner, tank and gank on a cruiser. 

A went to a trusty old friend, the Drake. Plenty of room for gank, I slapped on a little tank and with some tweaks I fit my new super shiny sniper finder. For good measure I even fit a tracking disruptor with a tracking speed script. I wasn't leaving anything to chance. 

I undocked knowing that this was it. My plan, my content, HIS content was about to happen. I felt my pulse start to quicken as I launched my probes. 

I had been very close to him earlier so it didn't take long at all until I saw a Tornado identified in my scanner. I quickly pulled my drones in hoping he wasn't paying enough attention so they could spook him.

My pulse was going pretty fast now. Fast enough that I could feel my heartbeat. I didn't want to screw this up, I have a good plan dammit. I made a mental checklist of what to do in the next 30 seconds to make sure I hadn't forgotten anything and took a deep breath. 

I made sure my tank was active and hit ""Warp to"".

While I was in warp I went through my mental checklist again. ""I'm good, I'm good"" I told myself. 

As I landed I could see my target, identified by a color icon  due to standings I knew it was him even before I could read his name. 

My heart was pounding extremely hard now, it flashed through my mind that this is insane! It is a video game!  That thought quickly disappeared though as the reality of the situation was unfolding on my screen and his. 

My hands now almost mechanically went through the mental checklist.

Start locking target. 

Activate Kill Rights. 

My scram, web and target disruptor all lit up as soon as I had him locked. 

I set my Drake to orbit at very close range and activated my afterburner to make me even harder to hit with those massive guns of his. 

Then I launched my first volley of missiles. Even though everything had gone to plan so far, I wasn't comfortable until I saw them slam into his ship to see what kind of damage they did. 

BOOM!

A giant portion of his shields were vaporized instantly as I launched my drones. 

I let out an audible gasp realizing I had held my breath since I landed on grid and that this was going exactly as planned. 

Only as he was halfway into armor did I even see a yellow box. A single artillery volley was shot at me, or rather in my general direction, like a futile Hail Mary at the end of a football game with the accuracy of a V1 missile. 

 A few seconds later revenge had been served. Tornado guts littered the field. 

I had an idea. I made a plan. I adapted. I made content. 

I had fun!

I regularly put the minimum bounty amount (100k) on random people that I find in all parts of space. When they die I get a notification of them dying, and then I can go on eve-kill or whatever and see what they died in and who killed them and where.


I see my duties similar to those of a wild life ranger - tagging animals in the wild to monitor their movements and social behaviors. I plan to keep my findings neatly organized in an excel document to be published in Nature.

Anyone else do this because it's pretty neat

Instead. this is a story of my addiction to this game, and I am willing to call it an addiction saved my life.

My housemate came home drunk from a rave, had a smoke and went to bed. I was on a small roam with 2 other people. 15-20 minutes past now I start to smell something..


 I turn to my left and I see that the whole outside balcony is on  fire.. I start gathering up buckets full of water and yelling out ""The house is on fire wake up""... now.. 

apparently some drunk housemates don't wake up to this .

it was not until my third cycle of running to the taps with a bucket that he finally woke up..

he came with me with my big bowl of water to the door.. looked at the falmes and said... ""Oh fuck""

my sentiments exactly 

we managed to get it under control.. I went to my computer and I saw that I was being agressed by a dragoon,I had been nueted but not scrammed I tried to warp but when I started to move they put on scram.  I was 3/4 shields down. as my house was on fire this was not a big priority. So I set myself to orbit at 1000 and set my autocannons on. I went back to hosing down the amber that was still left...

I came back about 2 mintues later to find I was not dead in fact I had won my afk battle... I had put out a fire and beat you...You should feel sooooooooooooooooo bad

in fact I had won the fight and I was still alive..

http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=15686124


I dont really care that I won the fight.. all that I care about is I'm alive.


I told my fleet mates ""my house just set on fire brb""

I think they thought I was joking, but no

My girlfriend always complains I'm always staying up playing a stupid space game...

but this stupid space game literally saved our lives. If I was not awake and smelled the smoke the fire would have burnt upstairs the guest bedroom and our bedroom.

Eitherway. If I had not been asleep and playing eve. I have no doubt I would be dead... 

last night Internet spaceships saved my life...

When you have learned what cannot be taught, remember me. I was the one who told you so.**

**tl;dr (zen version): Man in concrete trousers should not jump in river to escape angry wasp.**

So I started playing just over month ago. I made [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/15inc2/had_eve_for_3_days_made_60_million_isk_is_this/) asking for some advice.

Stick with frigates they told me. ""Frigates are noob ships for noobs"", I thought. 

I join E-UNI. Stick with frigates they told me. We're at war and war targets will kill you. ""Frigates are noob ships for noobs"", I thought.

I bought a destroyer. A catalyst. I loved my catalyst. It had so many guns and looked awesome. I was a belt-ratting machine! And cocky with it. 

Then one day I took a quick shortcut through lowsec. ""What's the worst that can happen? I'll just quickly warp through here, no problem"". I jumped. I clicked on the 'abandon hope if you go into lowsec' box. Stupid box. I jumped again. This time it worked. I started warping. Oooh, fireworks, must have been a fight going on. Off I warp. I dock up. I go to get the stuff from my ship inventory. Gone! Wha? Where's my stuff? Wait, where's my SHIP? I'd been popped so hard as I started warping I hadn't even noticed.

Those bastards! I nearly quit Eve. At least my implant was safe.

I buy a new destroyer. War-targets in the area they said. ""Last time I wasn't ready, this time I'm so going to gank those war targets"". I jump though a gate, I can't even remember where. Smartbombed before I can start warping. Raging. ""FFS, no! But pods instawarp so I'll just get the f-SMARTBOMBED AGAIN?!? My Pod! My implants!!"".

Those bastards! I nearly quit Eve.

Clearly a destroyer wasn't badass enough. Time for the big guns. Imma get me a Brutix! Yeah. The internet says it's like, a tank made of armour. That's what I want! And only a couple of days for the skillz. This is so on.

""PVP is hard"", I think, ""I'm sticking to PVE"". I read the whole internet. I choose the ultimate PVE fit. ""Hmm, can't use all these T2 things, I'm pretty sure T1 will do fine. Yeah, this is a battlecruiser!""

I go to Jita. I spend an hour and a lot of my remaining money on my baby. This thing is like, the toughest ship ever! Off I fly. ""Smartbomb me now, you bastards! I dare you"".

Two jumps out of Jita a flashy engages my battlecruiser. Not FIVE MINUTES after I bought it.

""Crap, why the hell did I chose a PVE fit? Only thing worse than being clueless at PVP is being clueless at PVP with a PVE fit!""

Must stop hands from shaking.

""What is it, what is it? A daredevil, what's that? A frigate! Frigates are noob ships for noobs! What an idiot, imma so gonna kill him!. Lock up baby, lock up baby... ffs lock up damn you! Stupid slow locking piece of sh-ah, I locked him, now he's dead. Shoot him shoot him shoothimSHOOTHIM. Stop missing you stupid guns! Stay still you tiny, vicious, bastard.""

""Drones! Forgot the damn drones! Launch, launch, shoot him, yeah! They're shooting him. Still shooting. His shields're like totally, 1/4 red. Shit. Er, er, er, run for the gate! It's only a few kms away I can totally make it. Come on, come on, speed up you slow piece of sh-crap! He webbed me. Stupid tiny, webbing, shooty frigate bastard!!""

He sank my battlecruiser. Then he podded me for good measure as my futile tears of rage fell on the keyboard. 

I nearly quit Eve.

Then I bought a frigate.",,False,,t5_2qil9,1360437312.0,,,True,t3_187chh,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/187chh/this_lesson_can_be_learned_but_not_taught/,

And unlike most other EvE streamers, this guy did not have anything censored. System name and overview with handy celestials in crisp 1080p detail.

A light bulb appeared over my head, and I set off to generate some content. Since I have access to neither the manpower nor ISK to suicide a bunch of tornadoes on the guy, I did the next best thing - threw couple salvagers and afterburner on a spare scanning frigate I had lying around, and set his system as my destination.

After getting there, I was delighted to find out that the stream wasn't even time-offset. Spent some time getting my bearings, scanning down the wrong places and generally learning the art of finding someone in space. However, soon enough I had a 100% hit, warped in and started hoovering up the wrecks closest to his ship. This produced some strong words both in local and stream chat, a complete blackout of the stream for some time (he was still in local tho, had good time learning to estimate positions by warping around and dscanning) and eventual ""gotta go"".

This made me appreciate the single-shard nature of EvE just that much more. I could go and jump into this guys stream, interact with him, and have a great reason to practice something I had not done before in game.",,False,,t5_2qil9,False,,minmatar,True,t3_1cyn1s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1cyn1s/today_i_learned_to_love_the_singleshard_nature_of/,

  Recently I've noticed an uptick in the number of image posts (and other . .) that have ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with Eve Online except the title of the post.  Posts such as [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/16z4ok/solo_roaming_in_null_sec_in_a_destroyer/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/16z6iq/i_wish_some_dedicated_artist_would_do_a_cross/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/16wquz/how_i_play_eve/), [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/171un8/you_and_your_granny_roaming_lowsec_together_shit/), and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/16uu0w/when_im_cloaked_watching_a_pos/).

Now, it could be that I spend far too much time on /r/Eve.  But in my opinion none of these posts add anything to the subreddit except for that sweet sweet karma whoring.  

So I'd like to propose a new rule.  Any image or site posted to the subreddit MUST involve eve online in some form.  That means that an image much either include a screenshot or product of Eve Online (figures, books, etc) and a site must be on the topic of Eve Online (blogs about eve events, eve online forum posts, kill mail posting, etc).

I'd like feedback on this idea.  In the past the moderation team has been extremely laissez faire in regards to posting, but now that we are approaching 20K users, maybe it's time to at least skim down on the non-relevant posts.

Thanks,

-Aradon

P.S. if we do this we will need YOUR help in reporting posts that violate the [wools.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NylmdC_uEM)

without spilling the beans too much, bl. is currently on contract with the cfc. to shed some light on this i've decided to make a self post to explain what is actually going on and open up for some questions you might have. 

please do not upvote as i receive no karma for this ;_;7.

*  we are not blue with anyone. this means we can and [will shoot cfc entities](http://eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=18293176) whenever possible. we are not picky about fights, so long as they happen.

* this is not a month long deployment. we are testing the waters for a week and seeing if we like it.

* We are not allowed to shoot structs in the north. this part is actually awesome because elo has been getting burned out from it all. pos shots are mega boring and not what bl. is all about.

* we have been friendly with test for quite some time. many of our members use reddit and some even come from the old hbc. as an alliance and culture we like you a lot. however we understand that this is a war and the big guns are out. 

* if we had our way, we'd love to brawl you in every ship possible, but seeing as goons are so kindly bringing caracals out for everything, its hard not to dunk when all you see are hoops. 

* pizza are our actual bros and with them in the south we can continue being best of friends. prepare for mass bombs and more hilarious ratter kills.

* i won't get into the isk part because that's not the point of this deployment and its not really my place to tell. 

i'll be around for the next few hours to answer questions and/or dispel rumors as well as update the selfpost with answers from your questions.

thanks for reading!

This is not exactly a continuation of the [rambling, train-of-thought textwall](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/11cszw/a_retrospective_on_a_decade_spent_in_eveonline/) that I perpetrated upon this community a few days ago, but rather an attempt at a more structured, more incidental collection of stories and thoughts. And thus, we wade in hip-deep.

**The Guiding Hand Social Club**

Elephant in the room. I was a member of the GH-SC from it's inception, having been part of the newbie dickburglary that was Black Monkey. I touched briefly on this in an earlier thread, but at the start we aimed small. A target would be found, normally by finding people high-sec mining Veldspar in frigates (the least dangerous, least profitable of anything you might decide to do in EVE), looking up their corporation and then having one of our guys join said corporation on a different character. We would then proceed to declare war on them, using location agents to track down the specific whereabouts of their members and after the initial murder spree, spend up to a week camping the poor rabbits in a station. Meanwhile, the infiltrator would keep reporting on their movements, and do his best to sow dissent with the intent of crushing entirely the spirit of every member in the corporation. Care was taken to fight in cheap, disposable ships because accidents happen and you don't want to give the target any succor from any luck they may enjoy.

It is a very simple, effective concept of corporate dismantling, but required some measure of subtlety unless the targets were entirely braindead, or had just moved to EVE from Hello Kitty Island.

One thing we learned, is that divisions exist in any organized body. By that, I essentially mean that one cockgoblin is the leader, and one or more other cockgoblins covets that spot for the imaginary prestige, and out of the misguided notion that they could do better. This is, and always will be, the pressure spot. By tactfully clamoring for a ""change in leadership"", encouraging dissenters in private and then even ratting them out should matters not progress in proper fashion, people can easily be convinced to tear their own corporation apart while under traditional military pressure.

Because in the end, most will not fold only to pure force, or pure manipulation. While losing ships and getting camped in saps the fighting spirit, the cracks will rarely be fully visible unless the whole body is under stress. This is not exactly a secret and is the whole reason why CAOD (the corporations/alliances forum) is such a shitpile, because it is the natural starting point for any propaganda effort. BoB used to employ it beautifully with mildly pretentious Press Releases (e.g. ""The Pendulum War""), and the Goons had their threadnoughts.

**Roleplaying**

EVE-Online is an MMORPG, and I want to stress the latter half of that acronym. Now, if like me, you have played any other MMOs, you may have run across ""roleplayers"" there. Now before you raise your hand and start calling me hurtful names (of which I get enough from Tyrrax Thorrk because he's an asshole), remember that EVE is singular in the world of gaming. Whereas in World of Warcraft, the only ""venue"" for roleplaying is hanging out in Goldshire talking about how Group X murdered your parents/siblings/pets/masculinity and trying to hump any Night Elf that strays into your vision, the potential scope of roleplay in EVE is far larger.

For starters, anything you do in EVE has the potential for ramifications later on. I learned that again and again, often to a certain masochistic glee, because from the second we formed GH-SC, Raem Civrie was a role that I played. Not always well, or terribly consistently, but I tried my best to portray him as a cold-blooded opportunist that would and could shift his guiding principles to suit his immediate needs. This, along with my association with GH-SC, had it's consequences. On one memorable occasion, I joined a corporation in Firmus Ixion who at the time held space in Querious next to Delve. After less than half a week, I was booted because, and I quote, ""people refuse to be in the same chat as you"".

The most interesting moments in EVE are when your adopted ideology intersects with your real life morality, and realpolitik. A good example is the Jericho Fraction, founders of the Star Fraction, who espoused a brand of Ayn Rand-inspired Futurism that frowned upon the territorial nature of Alliances, essentially believing that excluding non-members from one's territory except in the case of dire threat was immoral (at last that's what I could gather from the whole thing). This was at the same time as they were resurrecting a major territorial alliance (the Venal Alliance). I can only imagine the potential dissonance of doing so.

I frequently had to reconcile my own actions with my own moral compass, something that kept me from performing any infiltrations of my own. In fact, I was close to being thrown out of GH-SC early on because all the drugs Istvaan was doing decided to take the form of frothing paranoia, bless his heart. He was worried I'd transform into a ""White Knight"" and betray them. But there was also an evil liberation to the whole thing, the knowledge that you could transgress on your own personal boundaries for immediate gain, and the sadistic thrill of hurting another human being. I learned too late that some doors, when opened, will not close again. Be warned.

**Consequences**

This has always been my absolutely favorite part of EVE. I still hold deep down the naïve belief that the universe gives a single shit about what you do, and the continued operations and success of GH-SC worried me for years because I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop.

Well, it did. And it was every bit as beautiful as I imagined it would be (Tyrrax may disagree).

First, a little backstory. Burnout was fairly common in GH-SC, although it might also be called laziness-fueled apathy, so we tended to take sojourns every now and then. One such led us to a lovely little constellation in Curse containing a deadspace complex, ""claimed"" but wholly unoccupied by a local alliance. In fact, a couple of independent corporations made their home there, and we proceeded to make life very difficult for them.

Fast forward two or three years. IAC, which was by then headed by Tyrrax Thorrk, and Vice-Presidented (read: ignored) by me, had grown into a major powerhouse in the Catch region bordering Curse thanks to the patronage of Against All Authorities. We ran a bunch of their shit, providing additional logistics and menial operations for them so that they could more easily hoard the high-value moons and shoot anyone who didn't speak Russian or Icelandic in the face. At the same time, Tyrrax had been growing restless for a while, probably due to his rather insane playtimes, leading fleets 24/7 and generally trying to keep the whole thing together day by day. Presumably he encountered the word ""delegation"" at some point and decided it wasn't for him.

Well, old habits die hard and he decided to do some robbery. A few other GH-SC operatives were roused from slumber and they went and stole a mothership. Said mothership was owned by one Jim Lowell, who while jovial had the tendency of passing out drunk, leaving his mothership logged in and sitting idle wherever the hell he was at the time. At one point, Tyrrax had to lead a defensive fleet for hours on end while the ship sat there motionless, just so the enemy wouldn't get the satisfaction of downing it.

So he took it, as one does. Jim, understandably, was distraught, and as the Chief of Security in Umbra Congregatio (which we all belonged to) the matter fell to me.

He came to me, and asked me about mounting evidence that Tyrrax was actually behind it. I put my salesman face on, and convinced him that it was merely a filthy lie, the latest in a long line of misinformation perpetrated by a frustrated enemy. I seemed to convince him so soundly, that at the end he said ""I trust you, Raem"", and the matter was ""settled"".

I very nearly threw up on the spot. Because Jim was a drunk, there was no denying it, and I often got the sense that EVE, and by extension his Mothership, was all he had.

Meanwhile, Tyrrax moved to offload and sell the mothership to a member of aAa, MorrisF.

MorrisF took the mothership, kept the money, and posted the whole story on the forums. Because MorrisF, years prior, had been a member of a corporation called Sturmgrenadiers-something, who hung out in Curse. We had completely forgotten about them, and years later MorrisF delivered our long-awaited comeuppance.

Somewhat related, I later discovered the meaning of a certain phrase that has adorned our private IRC channel's topic, when I was told that it was highly likely that the actions of GH-SC had, in at least one case, triggered or coincided with a suicide. I did not take it well.",,False,,t5_2qil9,1350172567.0,,,True,t3_11fqf9,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/11fqf9/a_retrospective_on_a_decade_spent_in_eveonline/,

#**Starbase Iterations in Odyssey**#

Greetings once again spacefriends! CCP Fozzie here with a dev blog for you covering some of our plan for Starbase iterations in our upcoming [***EVE: Online Odyssey***](http://www.eveonline.com/odyssey/) expansion on June 4th.

[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/64395/1/Old_Starbase_image.jpg)

The [Starbase](http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Starbase) (also known as Player Owned Stations or POS) feature has been a point of some slight contention in the past months. Starbases are in need of several changes to bring them up to the usability standards of modern ***EVE***, and our plans for them have evolved over time. Last year we made the difficult decision to step back and reevaluate our early designs for a completely new starbase system, keeping in mind that some hopes we had raised over the past year might not be fulfilled as quickly as desired. While we work on a new version of the longer term plan we have already launched an offensive against the biggest flaws of the current system.

For ***Odysseys*** release, teams Five-0 and SuperFriends will be working on a package of improvements to the current starbase system, hitting some of the major pain points that we have sourced from the community. Weve scoured the net for feedback and ideas, [the Council of Stellar Management (CSM)](http://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/) presented a detailed and prioritized list from their perspective, and CCP Bettik read every single post from start to finish in [the Small part of the community thread](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=194625&amp;find=unread) to collect all the specific issues raised.

From these lists we formed and prioritized a backlog of potential changes based on community priority and technical feasibility. Were working hard to get as much of the backlog as possible done for the June 4th ***Odyssey*** release. This blog will go over the key parts of the backlog so we can keep you all up to date and get your feedback.

Please be aware that when we say something is planned at this stage in the process there is absolutely no guarantee that each individual item will be delivered as part of ***Odyssey***. The starbase code is quite old and complicated; so it is quite possible we will hit road blocks when addressing some of these features, road blocks that in some cases could render one or more of them undeliverable. Since we at CCP have made mistakes with expectations management surrounding this feature in the past we want to be very clear. This is our educated estimate of what we think we can deliver based on this time period, but we cannot rule out roadblocks arising including but not limited to: unforeseen technical hurdles blocking a feature, the starbase code gaining self-awareness, seizing the buildings climate control system and roasting us all alive, and/or emergency response tasks taking developer time from feature work. Development within CCP is very fast paced, problems come up, schedules and priorities sometimes change; this is an unavoidable reality of game development. We will be working very hard to deliver these changes to you all in the ***Odyssey*** expansion, and we will keep you all up to date on our progress.

Now that we have the disclaimer out of the way, lets get a peek at what we are working on!



##**Private starbase hangers**##

The #1 item on the CSM-provided list is our #1 priority for this ***Odyssey ***backlog, and also the most complicated addition. SuperFriends are most of the way through implementation of a item storage version of the structure, and we have a separate listing for creating a ship storage version as well that we may or may not be able to get done for this release. We are aware that for wormhole residents especially the ship storage version of a personal hanger would be the most valuable addition, but we are starting with the simpler implementation task before tackling the more complicated personal version of the Ship Maintenance Array.

These structures are significantly different than existing starbase hangers so Ill go over some of the details in our plan:

* Similar fittings to a Corporate Hanger Array, but higher build cost.
* Normal members viewing the structure only see their own items, in the same way as when someone views the contents of a planetary customs office.
* Corp directors have the ability to see what members have items in the hanger, but do not have the ability to take or place items from/in the hangers.
* No limit on the number of characters that can use the structure, but storage is limited per character. The exact per-character volume is undecided but we are currently considering a range from 10,000m3 to 40,000m3.
* If a member leaves the corp, his or her items are left in the structure but cannot be accessed unless the player rejoins.
* If the structure is destroyed, it drops some but not all of the loot contained within.
* If the structure is unanchored, all contents are destroyed. A confirmation box warns the player if the structure is not empty, and ensures that the items are not destroyed by accident.


This customs office-like structure allows us to avoid requiring complicated management of the storage within the hanger.

Again I will mention that creating a personal Ship Maintenance Array version of this structure is also something we want to do, but it has some extra technical challenges so we cant promise anything quite yet.



##**Repackaging modules in starbase arrays**##

The inability to repackage modules in starbase arrays adds to clutter in starbase storage and makes people hit the stack limit far faster than they should. It is especially frustrating for those players who spend extended time periods operating out of starbases.

This change will allow you to repackage undamaged modules and drones inside a Corporate Hanger Array or Assembly Array so they can be stacked. Ships and containers cannot be repackaged since that could be used to overflow the array. If you repackage a group it works just like in station by repackaging everything it can and skipping the rest.



##**Swapping and fitting Strategic Cruiser subsystems at a starbase**##

Another fix that significantly affects our wormhole residents, this entails placing the Strategic Cruiser and subsystems inside a Ship Maintenance Array (adding subsystems to the allowed list for SMA storage) and then using a right click menu to access subsystem choice. The reconfigured ship can then be boarded or ejected as normal.



##**Accessing starbase arrays from anywhere within the shield**##

The requirement to move within range of each and every starbase structure to access their storage is a major annoyance for most starbase users, and one we are working to fix. Thanks to new advances in starbase technology, tiny drones will now carry items to and fro within the shield bubble. This changes the POS module access range to instead check that your ship is inside the shield, allowing players to access all the structures from one location.



##**Starbase setup UI improvements**##

Our plans here are to port over of the usability features from the probing system over to starbase setup. Plans include setting the little arrows beside the modules to scale with your zoom level the same way as the arrows in the probing interface so that they never get too small to use, and allowing you to manipulate the central cube directly for quick placement.



##**Removing the sovereignty requirement from Capital Ship Maintenance Arrays**##

Capital Ship Maintenance Arrays are giant SMAs that are currently can only be anchored in space that has been upgraded for supercapital construction. In order to reduce the number of SMAs needed to service large corps we are planning to allow CSMAs to be anchored in all lowsec, 0.0 and wormhole systems regardless of sovereignty status.

Just telling a story to get a newbie out of his early game depressions.  We've all been there.  I was told to make this story its' own post or else someone would steal it, so here we go:

I was in a schmuck alliance in the north who had decided to take a small gang of cruisers out east towards russian land for some kills. There was a bit of a war going on that direction, and we had bigger allies involved in the fighting, so it was safe enough territory in that we could call for backup but there were still enough hostiles around to make it a target rich environment.

So, we get coopted by the bigger alliance to scout one of the contested constellations. We peek around, kill an idiot in a cloaky ship who didn't cloak fast enough, and find out he was the scout for another small group. So, we engage, call out the enemy positions, and have a fun little firefight. Our allies bring in a big 100-man battleship gang. Right at that moment, the gate we're fighting on lights up, and the russians jump a 100 man battleship gang through. Our allies panic, and decide to do a hotdrop, i.e. calling in the capital ships. We see a cyno go up, then another. The russians had panicked and called a hot drop too. So, now we have capitals hitting the field on top of the battleship gang, and me and my crew in the cruisers are shitting bricks as we're completely outgunned. Our allies decide to call in their titans, so another cyno goes up... and a second one goes up at the exact same moment as the russians call in theirs.

At that point, we know the 5 or 6 cruisers we have left in our group aren't going to do crap, tacklers from both sides were streaming onto the field and bubbling everyone friendly or not, and those titans are about to drop a combined total of 4 doomsdays, so we run. That russian group we ran into earlier? They ran too, in the same direction. We end up about 50 kilometers apart on a planet, neither one of us willing to fight. Keep in mind, we're both far away from home, about 30 jumps through nullsec.

All the sudden, on local, one of the russian players starts speaking in english, and explains they just want to go home, and were going to take a shortcut through lowsec so they could make the trip back in safer hisec space. Turns out, we have to go the same direction and had the same idea to use hisec. So, we decide to team up, since the area was npc and lowsec space, so it was filled with pirates. So there we are, about a dozen cruisers, some with only a bit of hull hp left, a mix of russians, europeans, a few insomniac americans, and a very drunk australian all sitting in the same vent channel, limping through 0.0 and lowsec.

We finally reach the hisec gate, and there it is... a nightmare. sitting 20km off the gate. Everyone's silent for a moment, then one of the russians says something in russian. We ask for a translation, and the australian speaks up. ""I don't speak vodkaese too well, but I think he said let's kill that dumb fucker."" So, we jump the nightmare and nos, web, scramble, and bump the crap out of this lone moron with too much isk on his hands. He drops, hard, and the 8 of us to survive the fight have to peel off the gate to avoid getting finished off by the gate guns. An argument almost starts to kick up over how to divide the loot when someone looks at the killmail and realizes, none of the faction loot dropped. All that was left was a tech 1 warp scrambler and a few crystals. We bust out laughing and jump into hisec, forgetting that we were still on global criminal countdown and were promptly massacred.

That's considered a good night.

Original thread: http://failheap-challenge.com/showthread.php?12731-Once-upon-a-time-these-guys-took-the-meta-seriously

&gt;Given that Snuff's recent amicable co-kingship with PL, I thought I'd snoop around their online presence to see what these guys were up to security wise. After all, we've all heard about the unicode watermarking that goes on to try and catch spies. I did know some of it back when I was in PL myself (before the ragequit) but never really dug into it.

&gt;The PL forum dump made the unicode watermarking quite well known. However, there's also been rumours about screenshot watermarks. After all, a spy that knows about the unicode could either A) remove it (effort for non-techies) or B) just take a screenshot! Unfortunately, the PL dump mirrors all appear to have been aggressively chased down and removed. All I could find were some notes that ISPs had been contacted in regards to 'illegal forum dumps' and that had forced mirrors to remove it. 

&gt;So yeah, these guys take their shit seriously, this could be interesting! 

&gt;Off I went to the PL forums, and thankfully I still have a user account there who can see some public topics about PC threads and whatnot. I made the assumption that they would be somewhat lazy and not ONLY do the watermarking on non-public sections of the forum.

&gt;Mr Ramirez plays the spy and screenies the sekrit thread:

Image: http://onebit.us/x/i/IxuCXyZK8m.png

&gt;Now, what did I know about the PL forums? Well, all the public facing components are written in PHP for one. The best way to watermark the forum would be to embed something in the background that's invisible to the naked eye but still retrievable with a little trickery. The best known method to embed watermarks is to dynamically create PNGs and use the GD libraries in PHP to insert the mark (using imagecolorallocatealpha you can set alpha to 127 for 100% transparency).

&gt;So, with that knowledge in mind, I made some educated guesses and went to work in Preview on my mac. Lo and behold, playing with the alpha got me:

Image: http://onebit.us/x/i/cAk6RKogxR.png

&gt;Interesting! This is neat stuff really. It looks like only the post body has the watermark in it, so a quick check in Firebug and the CSS settings lead to https://www.pandemic-legion.com/forums/images/bg.png. Aha! Clever thinking, just use a repeating 100x100 square. 

&gt;The server must be using a unique user ID of some kind to create this watermark. Let's have a closer look at it!

Image: http://onebit.us/x/i/hG2znGBbIy.png

&gt;Pretty obvious now, a 5 digit key, going from 0-10. So we potentially have 00000 - 99999, that's a LOT of spies  

&gt;It looks like my watermark ID is 3856! Wait a minute though, my forum user ID is 4422  This is not good! Obviously the PL dudes are smart enough not to use the straight forum ID, because that leaves you open to being framed by crafty buggers (I'm too lazy for that).

&gt;4422 -&gt; 3856 

&gt;Well, at this point I pretty much figure I've hit the end of the road. I *assume* they're using some kind of algorithm on the back-end with a hidden key and/or salt. There's a lot of ways 4422 can be transformed into 3856! Still, there's another 20 minutes left on my train commute so why not dig just a liiiitle bit further 

&gt;I need to get a bigger sample size! Then I can do some analysis across the sample set and see if anything jumps out (but hope is low at this stage). I quickly figure out that whilst registered accounts need to be approved by the PL admins, and until then they can not see any threads, I can log in with them AND I can access the bg.png location on the server! 

&gt;With that knowledge I create some hotmail aliases (thank you hotmail), reggo some dummy accounts and get their user IDs + watermark IDs:

     4 4 2 2 --&gt; 2 2 4 4 --&gt; 3  8 5 6
     8 4 2 8 --&gt; 8 2 4 8 --&gt; 9  8 5 2
     8 4 2 9 --&gt; 9 2 4 8 --&gt; 10 8 5 2
     8 4 3 0 --&gt; 0 3 4 8 --&gt; 1  7 5 2

&gt;Hey now (and I spoilered it already above), there's definitely a pattern here! Whilst I expected to perhaps see *SOME* pattern given that the scramble should be reversible this is  stuff. Reversal of the forum ID is easily spotted, given the identical columns! Note that it really helps that I reg'd accounts in short succession so I had incremental IDs to work with. 

&gt;About 15 seconds of blinking at it and the 'algorithm' becomes quite clear. Just for being pedantic I quickly throw some ruby together

    def scramble_id (id) 
        morphed_id = """"
        id.to_s.reverse.chars.each_with_index { |digit,index| # walk through each digit with its index
            if index%2 != 0
                morphed_id += (10 - digit.to_i).to_s
            else
                morphed_id += (digit.to_i + 1).to_s
            end
        }
        p morphed_id
    end
    
    def unscramble_id (s_id)
        id = """"
        s_id.to_s.chars.each_with_index { |digit,index|
            if index%2 != 0
                id += (10 - digit.to_i).to_s
            else
                id += (digit.to_i - 1).to_s
            end
        }
        p id.reverse
    end

&gt;Yep! Sure works fine. A simple alternating shift based on the index of the digit. I think they had better stuff in the Roman days tbh. 

&gt;At this stage I think I can either A) be cheeky and try to frame some PL member :effort: or B) make a poast about it here.

&gt;Why? Well, it *is* pretty neat stuff and people here have been interested in crypto, steganography and the likes. It also shows you PL dudes really take your meta seriously. Lastly, I do love pointing out the derp, because if you are going to do something like this at least do it properly!

So I was broke last night as I flew around in my Rifter.  Anyway, I decided to try my hand at FW.  I read tutorial after tutorial but still didn't quite understand what was going on.  I began talking in the Militia chat and asked a few questions.  There's this guy who said he wasn't doing anything, and he'd take me on a run.

Fantastic!  Where do you want to meet?

25 jumps away.

I know the rule about not trusting anyone, but hey, it's not like I have a whole lot to lose.  Over the next 20-30 minutes I make jump after jump until I meet up with him.  He gives me two warp stabilizers and money to buy a different ship.  He was very patient with me and answered all of my questions.  Then he takes me plexing, I end up making 8 mil for just a few minutes of work, which is more than I had made in about a few days of missioning.  He walked me through the whole thing, and even explained the LP store and what sells well on the market.

I just wanted to share this with you guys.  It made me feel really good that I may have made a good friend on Eve by jumping into the deep end of the pool head first.",,False,,t5_2qil9,False,,,True,t3_1dsdn6,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1dsdn6/something_rather_amazing_happened_in_my_eyes_last/,

1361983924.0,172,self.Eve,19c2s0,Suddenly Pirates: A cautionary tale for new EVE players,keatsdothu,202,30,195,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/19c2s0/suddenly_pirates_a_cautionary_tale_for_new_eve/,"So let me tell tale of the day Idiot (a.k.a. me) had today.

1. Idiot is doing a level 3 mission in Aunia, feeling like a badass in his Hurricane battlecruiser
2. Halfway through the mission a blinky yellow pirate appears (let's call him Blinky from now on) in a puny Vigil frigate
3. Idiot warps out, hoping that the rats will aggro the pirate, warps back in, Blinky's gone, onwards with the mission
4. 5 minutes later Blinky appears again, starts looting Idiot's hard earned wrecks
**[Estimated losses at this point: 5 million ISK (loot and salvage from the mission rats)]**
5. Yet another player appears (let's call him White Knight) as Idiot finishes off the last rat from the mission, Idiot warps back to station
6. White Knight convos Idiot: 'Come back, I have Blinky pinned down, but can't break his tank, let's collect on his bounty together'
7. Idiot marvels at the valliance of White Knight, warps back in to lend a hand
8. Blinky's Vigil goes splat, Idiot stays pinned in the spot, he's busy reading his first ever bounty mail
9. In a blink of an eye Blinky reappears in a Hurricane, warp scrambler, web and NOS are on Idiot's Hurricane in an instant
10. White Knight says 'sorry, got to go', dissapears; Idiot starts burning away from Blinky, attacking him with everything he has
11. Blinky's Hurricane is clearly better tanked, Idiot is quickly in structure
**[Losses at this point: 5m + 30m (price of the modules and rigs on Idiot's Hurricane, since Idiot's ship of course has platinum insurance)]**
12. Idiot prepares to get his pod to safety when the dps suddenly stops and Blinky convos him: 'pay me 30 mill and I'll let you go'
13. Idiot sends the payment, warp scrambler stays on his ship, Blinky says: 'abandon your ship and come back in a shuttle so I can get a killmail'
14. Idiot is a state of complete shock, but remembering all the stories he read about gentlemanly pirates on the web he does as the pirate said
**[Losses at this point: 5m + 30m + 30m + 45m (ship didn't blow up -&gt; no insurance money)]**
15. Idiot comes back in the shuttle, shuttle goes splat
16. Idiot says 'may I board my ship now?', Blinky 'sure, go ahead', 5 secs later Idiot awakens in a new clone in Arnon with his chin on the floor

**[Complete losses: 5m (mission loot) + 30m (ship fittings) + 30m (ransom) + 45m (ship cost) + 20m (implants) = 130 million ISK]**

*Moral of the story: Don't trust white knights, don't engage pirates, don't pay ransom, don't expect pirates to be gentlemen, don't leave your ship, and lastly, your pod isn't safe, not even in high sec*

In case White Knight and Blinky happen to read this: Gentlemen, thank you for the lesson, I'm in awe of the terrible beauty, elegance and precision of the heist you've performed on me. GF, see you out there! :)

""In addition to the 68 flags in the bag, you have
a tackline. A tackline is a length of halyard
approximately 6 feet long; the exact length depends
upon the size of flags in use. The tackline is
transmitted and spoken as tack and is written as a dash
(hyphen) ""-"".  It is used to avoid ambiguity. It separates
signals or groups of numerals that, if not separated,
could convey a different meaning from that intended.

Example:
If the signal SL2 means “Prepare to receive
personnel casualties,” TACK would be inserted
between the digit 2 and the given number of
casualties: SL2 TACK 27.

TACK also is used to separate range and bearing
figures. If C3 means “Investigate possible
sighting,” the signal might be C3 TACK 345 TACK
20, indicating the sighting at a bearing of 345 and
a distance of 20 miles.""

1348081495.0,165,self.Eve,105eqv,Daytrippin' - A Guide to Being a Wormhole Scavenger,paxNoctis,200,35,156,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/105eqv/daytrippin_a_guide_to_being_a_wormhole_scavenger/,"**Abstract**

Perhaps it is inevitable given the silence of WH dwellers on forums, combined with the nullsec bent on /r/Eve, but very little information about WHs is made available here.  After answering several basic questions over the last few days about WHs and then seeing the post about the poor newbie with his Atron that entered a C3, warped to a site blindly and got Sleepered to death, I decided to write this guide, which may or may not be the first in a series.  This guide covers Daytripping, that is, exploiting WH resources without living in them.  

**Who is this guide for?**

Unlike the archetype of the 5 day Rifter pilot tackling things in nullsec, WH space requires a bit more from you.  To start on this course, you need to be able to probe, preferably in a cloaky CovOps ship, but really any ship will do.  This requires Astrometrics and the Astrometric support skills.  They don't have to be great, but they have to be there.  You'll also need a combat ship, and a salvage ship (You can fit out a salvage Destroyer, or the Noctis  with a cloak is even better).  For starting purposes, you can't go wrong with the Drake right now (until the nerf anyway), but any well-build, T2-tanked and armed Battlecruiser can do the trick in the WHs we'll be starting off with.  This isn't a ton of SP, but if you're less than a month or two old, you're probably not ready to start Daytripping yet.

**Preparation**

You'll need to know how to probe:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0mnqsJMw4CU

You'll need to know how to look up a wormhole by it's J-code (At the top left of your screen where the name of the system usually goes you'll see a code like J123456, this is the WH's unique ID.  Example (just replace the part after 'system=' with your J-code):  http://eveeye.com/ips.asp?opt=48NB&amp;system=J132401

You'll need to know the different WH effects (Some have none, but some have effects, you'll learn this when you look up the J-code: http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Wormhole_environment_effects

Good General Information:  http://wiki.eveonline.com/en/wiki/Wormholes

You'll need either two or three ships fitted.  A Salvage ship (Destroyer/Noctis generally), a combat ship (BC, well-tanked) and possibly a scanning ship (most BCs have a spare high slot to put a Sister's probe launcher in if you want to keep it to two ships).

**Analyzing a Hole**

If you watched the probing guide and practiced a bit, it won't be long before you stumble upon an Unstable Wormhole.  What lies beyond could be anything from a different part of the K (k-space -- the boring parts of space that everyone else hangs out it) to a cornucopia of money in W-space, to an occupied hole full of people ready, willing and able to kill you within seconds of you showing up in their hole.  This is where the fun starts.  You can learn a lot about a WH by just doing a Show Info on it.  The second part of the description will have two sentences that tell you two things:  how close the wormhole is to collapsing naturally (roughly), and if it's close to collapsing due to traffic going through the 'hole.

For time collapse:

* Life cycle has not begun:  This means you've found a wormhole just as it is forming, and it will spawn in a minute or two.

* Probably won't last another day:  This is the wormhole's main life, and has over 25% of it's total time remaining.

* Reaching the end of its natural lifetime:  This signifies the wormhole will be naturally collapsing soon, having less than 25% of it's total time remaining. Collapse is imminent.

For collapse based on mass-of-ships passing through:

* Has not yet had its stability significantly disrupted: This indicates the wormhole is still quite stable, and has over 45% of its total allowable mass left.

* Has had its stability reduced, but not to a critical degree yet: This means the wormhole has seen a decent amount of travel, and has less than 45% of its total allowable mass left.

* This wormhole has had its stability critically disrupted by the mass of numerous ships passing through and is on the verge of collapse: This means exactly what it says. The wormhole has had most of its total allowable mass used up, and has less than 5% left. Collapse is imminent.

If a hole even looks at risk of collapsing, move on, especially if it's a mass-collapse and not a time-collapse, which means lots of ships are using the hole, which means it's probably occupied by people with a lot of ships.  If it's a newer hole and has lifecycle left, get 'ye into it.  While holding cloak, look up the wormhole by J-class.  Is a a Class 4 or higher?  Get out, not soloable.  C3?  Maybe get out unless you're confident in your skills or flying something like a deadspace-tanked Tengu.  C1 or C2?  Perfect.

If you look at that link I linked out earlier (http://eveeye.com/ips.asp?opt=48NB&amp;system=J132401), let's see what we can find out about this system.  It's a C2 (good so far, we can solo here), the graphs over on the right tell us there's been very little activity here -- no kills, no poddings, no jumps and no one running NPC sites.  It has a static (static means there will always be this type of exit in the WH, although it will change and move periodically) exit to Low Security k-space, and another static entrance to a C2.  

It has no effect, but not very good PI.  Other than that last fact (PI is very important when you actually live in a hole) I'd consider living in this one myself. 

**DSCAN Mothafucka, do you speak it?**

We now reach the most important part of this guide, the part where I tell you that if you don't DScan ever 15 seconds (at the most) you're probably going to die horribly and you're absolutely going to deserve it.  Don't know what a DScan is?  Watch this:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_-S65_DLsA

Okay, good.  Now, here's the thing.  There's no local in w-space.  There are no gates to watch.  At any moment in time a new wormhole from an occupied hole can open up to your space and disgorge a horde of T3 cruisers who want nothing more than to ruin your day just because they can.  You cannot be completely protected from this happening to you, especially as a Daytripper because your only retreat is your exit hole, which is predictable, but by judicious D-scanning and remaining aligned to your exit, you can be relatively safe -- nothing worth doing in Eve is without risk.

To give you an idea, a good prober (which people in live in WHs tend to become very quickly if they plan to live there long) can find you within a seven second window (that is, you have seven seconds to see his combat probes in range of your DScan before his buddies are warping to you).  They can enter the hole, do a system wide scan, use a tighter-angle DScan and some manuevering to find out what site/celestial you're at, then just tight-probe that area and be on top of you.

So reduce the risk of sudden death, we set our DScan to 360 degrees, max range, and we mash that scan button constantly.  If we see *anything* we don't expect (combat probes, other ships, wrecks we didn't create, etc.), GTFO.  No, ""Well there's only one more sleeper to salvage"" or, ""I can finish this site"".  No.  Shut up.  Get the fuck out.  What are you still doing there?  Okay, you're dead.  You should have GTFOed when I told you to.

There's a lot more you can do with DScan, but we'll get into that in another guide (maybe).

**First Steps**

You entered the hole, you immediately bookmarked the exit you just found yourself at (not doing this is a mistake most WH newbies make exactly once), you checked it out on eveeye and found it to your liking, Dscanned the exit and not found any POS towers or ships.  So far so good.  Now what?

First off, get the hell off the exit.  If anyone lives in the hole (and many of us put out POSes on the farthest reaches of the system where they don't show up on DScan for most entry holes) they probably have that exit bookmarked already.  They could arrive at any time.  Go to the sun, then bounce around planets a few times, making mid-warp safe-spots as you go and DScanning constantly.  If you traverse the system correctly, your continual DScanning will reveal any POS.  Also check the POCOs to see if they're Interbus.  If they're not, check what corporation owns them.  It's not a ""GTFO"" moment to find out that ev0ke put POCOs in the 'hole, but it's something to consider.

Once you're relatively confident you're alone and have some hiding places (remember, any given hiding place is good for about 20 seconds for a dedicated prober) and drop a probe and do a full-width scan.  There will probably be a lot of signatures, which we're going to ignore because you're a daytripper.  There will probably also be sites -- they'll have names like Perimeter Hangar or whatever, and even off just one probe you'll be able to bookmark them.  Bookmark them all.  Go get your combat ship if you're not already in it, and start making ISK.

You can do a quick google on the site name to find out what to expect, what the dangerous vessels are (ie: kill them first dumbass) and what the triggers are.  Do this.  Then warp to the site.  Sometimes sites have already been cleared -- you know you're going to hit a good site when the moment you start to warp to it you get a little message box about the Sleepers awakening.  Kill the sleepers while DScanning constantly.  Leave the hole, get your Salvager, come back to the same site and salvage all the things.  Lather, rinse and repeat until the sites are all gone or the hole is about to close.  Don't take risks with the hole -- if it starts nearing the end of it's life cycle, go find another one.  Check the Show Info on it every time you change ships.

**Moving on in?**

So that C2 hole I linked you to before.  As a long time WHer, I can tell you that's a damn sweet find if it's empty.  C2/C2 means you always have soloable sites to run, and the second C2 will have a k-space and a w-space connection, which opens exploration options.  It's also a lowsec static, which means fewer day-tripper and walk-ins, which can be very annoying when you actually live in a hole.  It also has nearly-perfect PI -- that is you can PI anything worth PIing in it.  If I probed that hole down and found it empty, I'd be hard pressed not to move in to it.

Now, if this is your first day trip, trust me, don't.  You.  Are.  Not.  Prepared.  But if you've been raiding holes for a while and had a close call or two and escaped it, maybe you are.  Now, I don't plan to go in-depth on how to stage and move into, then live in, a wormhole here.  This is a guide to day-tripping.  
You do have other options, though.  A good, empty wormhole with perfect PI and awesome statics like the one I linked is eminently brokerable.  Seek out a WH broker on the forums (or join the in-game ""Wormhole Sales"" channel and ask for a broker there, and you can net 200-500m just for the entrance.  It might take a few days (during which you park a cloaking scanner alt in there to scan down the new exit once someone buys it), but the return is pretty huge, as you can see.  It only takes a few days to train up a probing alt or two to stick into sellable holes.  One of my major income streams in the C2/C3 I live in today is selling the C3s if I find good ones.

Your other option for such a near-perfect hole is squatting.

**How To Be A Squatter**

If there is a lower form of scum that daytrippers (as a permanent w-space resident daytrippers are like cockroaches -- they show up at the most annoying times and often cause an undue panic that can set productivity back by hours), it's squatters.  Now the hole we've been talking about so far is empty, so if you decided to squat there for a while, no one would really care.  For the purpose of this guide, I'm only going to cover squatting in empty holes.

If you stumbled on that C2 and scanned down a ton of signatures and sites, you couldn't possibly do and salvage them all before the hole closes, not to mention the static C2 inside provides you with practically infinite sites to run with patience and a big ship for hole-collapsing.  It's time to squat!

You'll need a corporation (your own), a small or medium POS tower, a Ship Maintenance Array and a Corporate Storage Array at a minimum.  For longer-term squatting you might want some shield hardeners or protection (dickstar or deathstar works).  Basically you find a distant moon on a far planet, drop your POS and modules and online them.  Congratulations, you're now kind of living in a WH.  With this setup you won't survive even a rudimentary, probing assault, much less an invasion, but you're not here forever, you're here to make a shitload of money and leave.  You're a weektripper now, or a month-tripper.

In addition to the ship types already indicated (scanning, salvaging and combat) you'll also want a way to move stuff.  Orcas are fantastic at this, but since you have a lowsec static, you might want a cloaky transport ship too.  You might want to train up gas harvesting or obtain yourself a mining alt on another account/slot (or just buy one from the CBazaar) and bring a ship or two for him.  You might also want a PVP ship.  Just remember, you're squatting, not staking a permanent claim.  Anything you bring into the hole and store there is potentially lost the moment you bring it in, remember that.  Bring enough Stront to reinforce the shields for ~14-17 hours, which might give you a snowball's chance in hell of retrieving at least some of your shit should you come under attack.

At this point, you do the same things you were doing as a daytripper, just more often.  You'll want to be probing down those sites you were ignoring before, some of them will be extremely valuable to you, and we are doing this for ISK, right?  You'll want to keep tabs (ALWAYS) on your exit WH and any other wormholes in your system.  Keep a note in your Notes window with every known signature code and what it probes down to, and any time you see a new one pop up, scan it down.  Remember, other people can scan down an ""new"" entrance to your hole and open it, so just because you know where your 2 statics are doesn't mean there isn't a third non-static that opens to a C4/C2 somewhere.  At some point, you'll run out of sites in your main hole (they respawn, but based on how w-space works the more you run them the slower they respawn, kind of).

By then you should be pretty wealthy.  If you started this guide with a Drake and a prayer, suddenly that 3b Tengu fit isn't seeming so unlikely.  At this point you can just tear down your squatter's tent and move on, you can start farming your C2 static, or you can move in, move in, set up a real POS, get PI going and become a full time w-space resident.",,False,,t5_2qil9,1348465201.0,,,True,t3_105eqv,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/105eqv/daytrippin_a_guide_to_being_a_wormhole_scavenger/,

Rather interesting corpmail that made me LOL. from my ceo.



""Sanshas just saved my carrier.

That's... an unusual feeling.


Here we are running a level5 mission. 7 guys in the fleet, one is AFK. 6 ongrid. I'm deeply focused on logistics and don't notice the 8 pirates that show up on our overview until they come screaming past my viewscreen.

Ladies and gentlemen, shit has hit the fan.

I call bail. Everyone just warp off to a random station. My fleetmates comply and except for &lt;omitted&gt;in his brutix and &lt;omitted&gt;in his omen, the fleet gets out safely.

Now it's just me, 6 pirates all warp-scrambling me, and the sanshas that are left. They didn't have enough to break my carrier's tank, so it was a stalemate, I thought.

While I was thinking of a way out, I realized 2 of the pirates were gone. Then a third. Then a fourth.

They were all fitted for PvP, i.e. a solid hitpoint buffer and lots of DPS. They weren't equipped to siege a carrier in the middle of a mission. They had no staying power against all the sanshas still in the mission. One by one their buffers got picked off and they had to warp out.

But they kept coming in, too.

I had the upper hand. I had more DPS than they did. I had 25 heavy ECM drones in my drone bay for a time like this. Fighters, too. I waited for the sanshas to pick off as many as possible before attempting to jam the last few to be able to warp off.

The sanshas primaried a myrmidon. Myrmidons, though, are active-tanked. An actual mission fit with staying power. No problem. I do 1000dps with fighters.

After that guy went down, there were only 2 left. A maller that just came in, and a vagabond. I'm pretty sure the maller pilot is being ridiculed in comms right now, because he was in range and shooting me, but didn't have a scram on me. All I had to do was jam the vagabond and I could leave.

Launched ECM drones, waited a few seconds, and boom. Locks broken. Pull my drones and warp out, victorious.

Yep. We were victorious. Sure, they crashed the mission, but they lost more than we did. They lost a tech-2 fit arbitrator and a tech-2 fit myrmidon. We lost a tech-1 brutix and tech-1 maller. And a cheap maulus. All in all, they lost more ISK than we did. We won.""

So i'm about 7.5m SP and only 7 months old here, still learning but I do lots of reading about game mechanics, pos all that fun stuff to keep myself educated of the EVE Universe.

Well 2 days ago I was doing a level 4 mission in my dominix in high sec gallente space to get some money to buy some more cheap pvp frigs while waiting to be able to jump into my cheap clone.

Daredevil comes in, starts stealing my loot and gets flagged I ignore him and know that he'll probably have friends and its a trap.
However, He was 20 km away and I can hit from about 80 km away with my rails and let me sentries get him. I wondered, can I kill him before he makes it to me if I get that far?

I used my micro jump drive and shot to a distance of 78km away from him dropped sentries and openned fire.

It was a trap, shocker lol, he sped towards me at 2 or 3km/s and my sentries couldn't hit him, but my tank was too strong for him to deal enough damage really so I just kind of sat there and used my hobs to destroy his hobs, when my hobs got targeted i'd scoop them and redeploy. Rince and repeat and he loses all his hobs.

His friend comes in and reps him, now my hobs don't deal enough damage and I can't hit his friend. His friend also scrams me and the daredevil flies off. I was at 100% armor still from my reps.

He comes back in a hurricane and I quickly try to blast him, but he gets within 8000 meters of me and I am in structure. I said to myself well this is my fault, least I can afford a new one.

He convos me and tries to ransom me for 80 million. I was in a clone with 300m of implants, yes I could pay it, but nothings stopping him from blowing me up anyways. I said nah you can have it and ejected and warped off. I get to a station after a bit and dock once the timer wears off to dock. I notice I haven't gotten my insurance notification yet. I wait for their kill right timer to disappear after 5 minutes.

I hop into the velator I was given for having no ship and fly to the mission site that my ship was ejected from in. They are there still, and there is an orca coming. I slowly race this orca to my ship, I get there and the orca comes up to my ship, I am ejected and constantly clicking board and I know I can't board until it is untargeted.

The repping friend untargets and I am in. I have my ship back and I start to align and get out just incase they try to kill me despite concord. In such anger as I warped out they blew up my velator and raged.

I laughed my ass off all the way to the station and docked.

I made about 1 billion from 500mil invested in about two weeks. Not bad! I could pay for two plexes every month at this rate and have 500 mil to pvp which is awesome.

I was trading and selling the recent PLEX I bought for 477 mil for 485 mil via private contract to avoid the taxes. So I did just that and made a nice 7 mil profit. And then some guy sold me his Astarte for 220 mil - I sold it for 250 mil to someone else via trade window. I was feeling pretty confident that my legit trading was making me such a profit.

And then a guy contacted me telling me he was going to null soon and hes getting rid of his ships. A firesale. I was thrilled to take his faction ships off him for such a reasonably cheap price. I wanted it quick, he opened trade window with me and I gladly accepted. Turns out, they were just regular ships with changed names. Fuck.

I contacted the guy, and told him he got me good. And wished him GL and fly safe and stuff.

Sometimes, you run plexes and you get something worth a billion isk. Sometimes you're ratting belts and a faction spawn appears or even an officer. You get a lucky break and make a shit ton of money.  I was this guys lucky break, and he made a ton of money. Good for him. And I ain't even mad.

So there it is, EVE online. Don't be discouraged because you lost a ship or something. This is my most expensive loss to date, my second being  smartbombed at a gate while in my pod containing a full set of LG slaves and hardwiring for 850 mil , and my third being suicide ganked in 0.7 for a Gist B type adaptive invuln field worth 700 mil, and I am a rather conservative PVPer using T1 ships and t2 modules and occasionally, a t2 ship for pvp.

So...there it is. I felt dizzy and winded after I repacked the ships and realized im an idiot. Fuck. Just gotta keep on. ^^",,False,,t5_2qil9,False,,angel,True,t3_vp4n2,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/vp4n2/i_just_got_scammed_for_about_25_billion_im_such_a/,

Let me tell you my story. 

I've been playing since 2004. I loved the game, the people, but most of all, the possibilities. By 2008, I had found myself in a major nullsec holding alliance. Life was good. The ISK was rolling in, the people were great... but there just wasn't enough action for my taste. I needed something new. That's when I heard about people creating alt accounts to infiltrate corporations, gain trust, and rob them blind in the end. I decided to give it a go.

I rolled a Gallente character and decided to noob it up for a little while. It was refreshing, having a clean slate and no ties to anything, seemingly limitless freedom. I knew from my experience, however, that without other people, I would be fighting an uphill battle against the universe. I decided to do a little mining as some income while I looked for a target corporation.

Soon enough, the opportunity came. I started chatting with some guys running a little mining operation out of the Center for Advanced Studies. It was just 3 guys. Two Retrievers jetcanning and an Iteron hauling. Got to chatting with them, and they seemed like good guys. Just a little too trusting. Perfect.

The leader, we'll call him DQ, talked about his plans to start a corp of his own so we could put up a high-sec tower, research some blueprints, and start producing and selling our wares. I was already training for Exhumers and an Itty 5 with plans of attaching myself to them. It paid off - I was invited to join them.

First order of business was to move out of Gallente space. High-sec botting was getting ridiculous and the belts were frequently picked over, if there was anything left at all. After a little while of DQ scouting around, he found what sounded like paradise to a high-sec miner. He spoke of a region where botters hadn't touched, the asteroids were huge and plentiful, and the place was nigh deserted. We were moving to a small region in Amarr space.

Over the coming months, we got in with mission agents for a hard grind, eventually getting the corporation's standings with the region's holders high enough for us to plant a large tower. We set up labs for researching, most of us were in Hulks by that time and business was good. It wouldn't last.

It wasn't long before we caught the attention of high-sec wardec corps. I knew I needed another alt, one specialized in warfare. We'll call him V. My original alt we'll call J. Our corporation was up to 15 people, excluding alts, but we were still heavily outnumbered and outgunned. We had to play it low-key, hiding in stations until they got bored. It was no problem for DQ, who knew the market game and had jumpclones all over the trade hubs of New Eden, but for the rest of us, it meant we might as well not play Eve at all.

Soon after the war corp finally dropped its declaration, Apocrypha came out. We found a Class 3 wormhole and went in with the corp's new Orca, dropped a tower and started setting up for running sites. As you all will know, however, Eve is not that easy.

For a time, it was insanely profitable. It was a Pulsar system, giving bonuses to shields. We were outfit in Drakes and Tengus when we got skilled for them and when we could afford them. Turning a profit was not difficult at all. Then another corp found our wormhole and moved in with the intent of forcing us out. We were fed up with being pushed around and weren't going to give up the biggest cash cow we've ever had without a fight. But, once again, we were faced with the issue of being outnumbered, and outgunned. But this time it was different. We were in wormhole space. Thanks to dedicated scouting and a playerbase pretty evenly split between the US and England, we were able to get a lock on their numbers at about 25 members, US timezone heavy.

We got into the practice of scouting the exits, waiting for one of them to leave, and collapsing the hole behind them. Using this strategy, we were able to shut out a decent portion of them. Then, late one night, as I was scouting the high-sec static exit, somebody came *in*.

I was sitting off the exit, cloaked in my new Manticore with V. The newcomer was a neutral party. Flying a Helios. I was aligned to the hole with a Shrapnel loaded... I could have nuked him without a second thought. But, I decided to see what was up. After a little while of talking, I was able to confirm that he was a genuine neutral party. We'll call him ""S."" He and his corp were much like us, looking for a wormhole to turn over some ISK. S talked to his CEO and Directors and I talked to DQ, and we put them in contact with each other. They already had an Orca set up as a sort of ""Wormhole Backpack"" for quick deployment. We helped them move it in, they set up shop, and we found some new allies. Our two corporations together now were what seemed a mighty 40 members.

Over the next week, we went to war. Our first war without an official, paid declaration. We laid siege in battleships on the enemy tower in the first, and last, Downtime-to-Downtime stretch I've ever done. It was the same for many of our number. We persevered, and we won. We blew up the enemy tower, managed to grab assorted battlecruisers out of their SMA, and were able to rep, un-anchor, and steal a good number of POS guns. The operation was a resounding success.

After we had run the Class 3 dry, we pulled our resources out of the wormhole and made an official alliance between the two corps. This was April of 2010. Fast forward a year.

The alliance was looking good. We had added many corps to our ranks and the alliance was nearing 500 members. A falling-out with DQ had led to a lot of the original members joining with other corps in the alliance or splitting off and leaving with DQ. I joined S's corp, to be with the other Originals. Over the coming months, I gained Director status, and after the CEO had to take some time off due to real-life, I was selected to take his place. The whole plan was nearing fruition.

The gun was loaded and put in my hand, even aimed for me. The timing was perfect. All I had to do was pull the trigger. A few billion in assets, another billion or so in ISK, I could grab it all and disappear. I just couldn't do it. Over the past two years these guys had become my friends. People I genuinely cared about. I couldn't do it to them. I couldn't just throw away the friends I had made.

So, here I am. A Con Man that got too close. I went in fully intent on robbing some poor suckers blind, but in gaining their trust and developing that relationship, I allowed myself to care. I eventually dropped my original 2004 character from the nullsec alliance to join my new friends, and today we look to the future.

I don't want them to find out about what could have happened to them, what I could have done. I just thought this was too good a story not to share, and one that you don't see all that often in Eve.

So Eve looks great and I've been sort of looking at it from the outside for a while, but there is a lot of stories about any 'serious' corporation requires voice confirmation to know it's you and so on. So, my question posed, is voice-chat essential to the Eve experience, or can you play and actually be involved in things without it? I'm not talking about becoming the #1 player in the world, but at least being able to enjoy everything the game has to offer and not be relegated to spending time looking at an empty chat because everybody is on voice-chat and then being told about things afterwards.

In a move many in New Eden considered long overdue BNI CEO Matias Otero today announced the prohibition of enjoyment in BNI. ""We have been at this for over six-months now and that is way too long for anyone to continue having fun in EVE, It's time we grew up and started to behave like a normal EVE alliance.""

The rank and file within BNI appear to be taking the news well, with most admitting that they are just alts and it is high time they stopped enjoying EVE and got back to playing it properly. Other, genuinely newer members however reacted with astonishment. We attempted to contact the rookie members of BNI for an interview on the matter, but they were offline -all both of them-.

Details are still forthcoming on what exactly these changes will mean for BNI members, so far the following has emerged:

* Pilots must now fit modules in every slot and will be expected to carry ammo (while this is yet to be confirmed many observers believe this rule may be so strict as to mean the ammo must fit the weapons).
* Salvaging is now to be done after a fight, not during, or occasionally, before.
* Upon the loss of a ship each BNI member will now be expected to immediately post their lossmail to the BNI killboard along with a 500 word essay explaining what happened and how they have brought shame upon their family.
* The loss of any ship valued at over 1mil ISK now requires the owner to wear a hairshirt for a full calender month (video evidence must be provided).
* Every fleet taken out must file a three page long After Action Report within 24hrs of redocking.
* No Bourbon.

*Editor's Note: Following the publication of this article we were contacted by Matias Otero and other BNI leadership regarding the last bullet-point, for the sake of clarity we will simply include Matias' words on the matter: ""While I am happy with everything else you have written it needs to be made plain to everyone that Bourbon is not banned, I am an EVE Alliance CEO, not a monster"".*

The implications of these changes are still being debated within the wider EVE community, although several prominent members and alliances have already voiced their opinions:

Spokesperson for CVA: ""It's about damned time, we have been trying to stop people having fun in Providence for the last ten years, maybe now BNI can stop people having fun wherever they live..."" *at this point a junior CVA member pointed out that BNI live next-door*  ""...ugh, oh okay, welcome aboard!""

Various Nullsec entities: This is welcome news, maybe we should give them Delve, that always ends well.

Spokesperson for Noir.: ""We couldn't be happier for them, remember: If you don't love your killboard, your killboard won't love you.""

Spokesperson for EVE-UNI: ""It is sensible for any good organization in EVE to want to help it's members play EVE properly and we are proud to see many of our own policies being implemented by BNI."" *We have since contacted EVE-UNI to pass on the update about Bourbon, sadly the incredulity in the voice of the Uni spokesman is beyond anything this writer is able to convey.*

Gevlon Goblin: I just came.

Edit (moved this bit from the top to the bottom): The EVE Onion inspired me to write a (hopefully) Onionesque article about EVE, trolling and criticism is welcomed and encouraged.

I'm still fairly pumped about the things I do and see, (and get done to me, over and over).   And this is just a long rambling story about last night.   If you are ADHD or just rage at pointless storytimes, downvote it an move on, this wasn't written for you.  :-P

Do you guys have any idea how long it takes a fully cargo-rigged IttyV to travel 400km under cloak?
Let me do this math for you.  10m/s into 400,000m is 40,000 seconds.  See how much fun math can be?
Oh wait, 40,000 seconds?  Yea, that would be 11 hours.
God I need sleep.

Wait, no, let me back up…..
*Rewind animation plays, subtitle now reads ‘EARLY YESTERDAY EVENING’*

Log in yesterday evening.
What should I do…
Man, it sure would be nice if I could do things out in my corp’s Null-Sec base.
But….. all I have are slashers out there, it’s 43 jumps from home, and 16 of those jumps are through NullSec, including 5 ‘pipe’ systems with only 2 gates.

Well, I guess *IF* I am eventually gonna make this trip, It would be helpful to have gatepings and midsafes in every non-hisec system on the route.
I *GUESS* I could do that, yanno, fast slasher with a Capstable MWD fit.
Suit up the alt, and head into the great unknown.
(To be fair, I auto-piloted through the highsec systems while playing a LoL game, a 800m/s slasher (without boosting) covers gates on autopilot as fast as an industrial manually jumping.)
In every null sec/lowsec system, I created a gate-ping, behind the gate in a random direction at either 300,350,400, or 450km (just randomly picking so that no two gate pings in the same system are at the same distance, what can I say, this game has made me paranoid as fuck.)

I also created at least one (sometimes several) Midsafes in each system, and ranked them by security level.
•	0Mid (zero security or UNSAFE) is a Midsafe I made traveling from one gate directly to another.
•	1Mid (Medium Safety) is a Midsafe made between any 2 static objects in the system assuming at least one of them is NOT a gate.
•	2Mid (High Safety) Is a Midsafe made between 2 objects in the system assuming at least one of them is not static (another midsafe or a scanned site, etc…) 

Only took me 3 hours, but by the end, I had a nice, bookmarked path from my new home to safety.   (yay)
Well, now wat?  I guess I should go home.  My alt isn’t in corp yet so I can’t dock at the NullSec base.
I suppose I could pod-explode myself home, but then I lose a kinda nice recon fit slasher.  (I know, slashers are cheap, but I have a 2m cloak in it and 2m is still money to me.)
Ask in corp (on my main) if someone can take my ship into the base and contract it to me.  Dude says, why bother, just apply to the corp and we’ll get your alt in.
Yay awesome, apply to….. wait, “You have to be docked to apply to a corp.”
Crap, ok, I am 16 jumps from a safe dock in Null sec….   Warp to midsafe, bail from ship, explode myself (I’ll come back for the ship later).
Get to base, apply to corp, get in, NOW yay!

Well, now I need to go back there and get my ship.  I suppose I could just set my clone to there and pod myself back, or use the jump clone now…. But then I would be out there with just a slasher and have to pod myself back again *sigh*
Wait, I have a nice bookmarked path now right?  If I’m gonna go back, I’ll take a useful ship with me!
Hmm, what to take…. Mining barge?  Data Hacker?  W-Space Scout?  Salvager?  Gas Miner?  So many choices.
Weeeelllll…. Why not take them ALL?
I mean, I have an IttyV sitting here with 25,000 m3 of cargo space.

Strip fit and repack my ships.   Mining barge, Magnate, 2 Ventures.  Break out the pen and paper and make sure I  all the fits to equip each one the way I want.
One Venture will be salvage.
One Venture will be gas miner.
Magnate will bring fits for both W-Space Scout (expanded launcher) and data/relic hacking fit.
Mining barge (Procurer) will bring fits for Strip Mining, Modulated Strip Mining, and Icemining along with heavy shield tank. 
Buy the extra things in Jita, I’ll make a stop on the way out.
Drones, ammo, probes…..
I still have like 5,000m3 left…   ooh, I know 5 PI command centers!

Fully loaded, sitting there.  Do I REALLY want to take a fully loaded industrial through 16 nulsec systems?
I spent 3 hours making the bookmarks right?  If not for this, what did I do it for?  Put my money where my mouth is time.
That sinking feeling you get when you KNOW you are making a bad decision, but you have to make it anyway.
I would pull my own man-card if I pussed out on this.

Deep breath, Let’s do this.  *UNDOCK*
Uneventful trip for the first 39 jumps.  Picked up my extra swag in Jita and rolled out again.
“The Jumpgate leads to a low-security system, Concord cannot guarantee your safety, are you sure you want to do this?”
….. No…… *cries*  NO I’M NOT SURE
But I do it anyway.

Every hair on end.  First few systems have several people in local.  Paranoid.  Warp to midsafes, warp to gate pings, cloak, watch gate, decloak and warp to gate to jump, wash, rinse, repeat.
One baby step at a time.

5 steps in, I get to a gate ping and there’s an interceptor sitting on the gate.  I cloak, he sees me.
He books towards me (400km), I pick a random direction 90 degrees from his bearing and start moving.
This is it, this is over, this is a hunter, and I am the biggest, fattest thing he could ever hope to see out in deep nullsec.
He knows there’s an IttyV in system, he sees me in local, it’s just a matter of time.
He rockets past me at 2,200m range.  (2,000m distance would have decloaked me).  
He gets 11k from me and starts random circling around, trying to find me.
I’m still moving (slowly) and he starts searching in the wrong direction.
After about 30 min, he warps back to gate.
I don’t hesitate, as soon as I see his engines cut out in prep for warp, I decloak and spam my warp key (having already aligned to my midsafe in the system).
Recloak and think….. what are my options here?  It’s a pipe system, one way in, one way out.
Keep checking D-scan, looking for probes….. nothing.
I…… I don’t have any options, time to go back.  Warp to my gateping back the way I came.
Holy shit, he’s here!  No, wait, that’s a different interceptor.  Same corp though, crap, he brought in a friend to guard both gates.
I don’t even bother cloaking, I initiate warp back to my midsafe.
Sit there for another 10 min or so… well crap…crapcrapcrap.

Well, it’s 3am at this point.   Server has downtime at 6am.
Right then.  Initiate safe log-out.  Set alarm for 6:15.
Go to sleep.

ALARM…….. fuck, less than 3 hours sleep. Do I hit snooze?  No, I need to do this, at least check.
Log in, servers had come-up less than 5 min ago.
Log-in screen shows 2,300 players total in the whole server.  Awesome.
Back in the cockpit. Engage warp to gate-ping.
Motherfujebusholishi….. CRAP
He’s still there.  And worse yet, He has been BUSY the last few hours.
FAST CLOAK, he must be tired too, he didn’t twitch.  Maybe he didn’t see me.
There’s a large warp bubble on the gate.
There 14 wrecks around the gate in the warp bubble.
There’s (I kid you not), 40-50 drones scattered around inside the bubble)
Any one of these objects can decloak me if I get within 2,000m.
It’s a godamn mine field.

Look closely at gate, it looks like there’s a hole, a hole in the debris.
Maybe I can thread it?  Like my IttyV is the world’s biggest sewing needle?
I have no other options.
I only got away last time because he was warping away from me.  If I decloak and run now, He’ll kill me.  I’m sure he sees me in local by now.  He knows I am somewhere.

Engage the slowboat drive, and it creeps up to the max of 10m/s.
Do the math….. 11 hours…. Yea, fuck 
Just as I got done thinking there was no hope, a 4th person appears in local.  Someone just gated in in front of me.
It’s a bc (‘cane).   Interceptor is on him like white on rice.  It doesn’t last long.  One more wreck in the minefield.

But …… the interceptor is moving towards the wreck…..  Oh, yea, loot, he’s going in to loot.
Here’s there for a second, then he warps off.  
WAT?   I freeze, scared, deer in headlights.  He’s gone, do I run?  To I book towards the gate?
He comes back, heads to the wreck again, more stuff.   Oh, he must have a secure container somewhere in system he’s dumping things out into, there’s no station.  Maybe a POS.
He warps off again.  I grab my phone and pull up the clock…..  I time him.   He comes back. 93 seconds.
Wreck is empty.

He goes back to his position by the gate, I continue to roll towards him at 10m/s.
15 min later a cruiser gates in.   Same nature-channel scene plays over again.  Swift kill, no sound, no chat in local, another wreck, another chunk of frozen biomass.
He loots the wreck, I see him align and his drive flickers, as soon as he’s off grid, I decloak and warp to gate.
Snared in the large bubble, 7k from the gate, less than 1,000km from a couple of drones.  Can’t recloak.  Aim away from the drones, head for the hole in the wreckage.
Watch the clock.  Get 2000m from the dead drones right as the clock hits 85 seconds. Recloak.
Sure enough, clock is at 96 seconds when he warps back.
He has no clue the reason he is here, is sitting 10k from him, 6k from the gate, and in the middle of a warp bubble and a debris field, cloaked, moving towards the gate at 10m/s again.

This time the math is on my side, I need to be 2,500m from the gate to jump.
10m/s is 250 seconds… 4 min.
4 of the longest min of my video-game life.

Watching the debris.  Hole is barely big enough for me. I squeeze between a drone and a wreck with 2,500m clearance on each side.
I’m good right?   Gate won’t decloak me until 2k, I can jump at 2.5k.
Evidently the decloak range is at the edge of the MODEL, and gates have BIG models.
Gate forces me out of cloak, and I’m at 2,800m from it. HARD BURN.
He locks me, I take one hit, two hits, shield is half gone….. and ……  Gatecrash, I made it.
Since he aggressed me, I know I have 60 seconds to get the fuck outta dodge, no one in local in this system, fuckmidsafes, right click far gate, JUMP.
No one in the next one either, JUMP, JUMP JUMP.
4 jumps in before I see another person, bounce to gate-ping, gate, gone.
3 more jumps, and there’s another person in Local….. and he’s blue!   A friendly!
I’m 3 jumps from home.
o7 in local, get an o7 back, big grin on my face, I just might actually fucking do this.
Even more blues and a green in the next system.  I’m home.
Another jump and I dock.

Unload everything, assemble and fit all my ships, and go and fetch my slasher I abandoned 8 hours ago.
Look at the clock.  It’s 7:52am.   Guess I should probably go to work now.

I’m gonna CRASH tonight.

A short BR:

I like to solo roam in Drone space with an incursus and kill either stupid frigate pilots or get lucky on a hauler. 

On Tuesday I came across an ice mining op in null-sec. By the time I landed in belt everyone had warped off and left a number of cans in the belt. Bookmarking a can I jump out of system and wait for about 6-7 minutes.


7 minutes later I jump back in and immediately warp to the bm. D-scanning my warp path I see a drake and a orca in the belt. I scram and orbit the orca and start pewing. Once I'm sure I won't bump into any ice roids if i have to emergency warp, I open up my drone overview and get ready to start shooting at anything that appears on it.


Nothing. No drones deployed and the orca is now at 60% shields. At this point I start to think that I could get away with this. Can I really kill a orca with a cheap frigate? As the orca enters 50% shields and I prepare to overheat when, Suddenly and without warning, the drake warps off 0_0


At this point I'm getting pumped because I have just overheated and it looks like I'll be able to overcome the orca's recharge rate. Everything is looking peachy until the drake warps in and redboxes me as the orca enters armor. Fortunately for me I'm ab fit and the drake has t1 launchers, no scram, no web, no target painter and most importantly no drones. So I can continue on as normal only now every 15-20 seconds I take 50ish damage from the drake.


The orca is entering hull when the worst happens. I spot a hurricane on d-scan.
At this point my heart is in my mouth as it looks like i'm about to miss out on my single greatest solo kill I have ever had. I'm almost praying that the cane is just some guy passing by untill he suddenly lands in the belt 10 km off me.

With the orca now in 50% structure I decide to just go for it until I die. The cane redboxes me and starts shooting.
At this point I thought I would die as the cane can easily get within neut range and shut my speed tank down but no, he sits 12 km off me shooting at a frigate thats going 1km/s with an afterburner \o/
The orca is now in 25% structure and I decide (mainly to calm myself) to stop d-scaning and checking for drones as at this point I'll gladly die to take down this orca.
With the orca now entering its last bit off hull the cane and the drake warp out leaving me to enjoy a well earned kill.

Then to our story. I'm part of small Finnish wormhole corporation called Kossu&amp;Keppana Inc, we live in C5 with static C3. On Saturday we started chaining our static to get some random ganks, after a few hours our scout found a system J112954 C3 static 00 which had massive amounts of ships on dscan. They were sitting on a small pos without any guns etc. We were sure almost instantly that there has been awoxing incident of some kind because no sane person would sit that kind of ships outside hangars in a small POS.


http://i.imgur.com/xnQQ6Hk.jpg


For those who don't know ""chaining static"" means collapsing your own static wormhole by jumping ships through it and using wormhole's mass to end. After static collapses it takes about 60 seconds for new one to spawn and after that you've a new C3 WH waiting for you. You can do this as much as you want so you can go through a lot systems in a day. There's 495 C3 in game to my knowledge, so our odds hitting in that system are a bit small, huh? 


We have some terrible Reddit lurkers amongst us so one of our members connected the facts quickly. We looked at the OP's images (http://i.imgur.com/wd18LF8h.jpg) and confirmed that in fact this is the system they were bragging about. All other intel like timezones, members inside wormhole and the fact they wouldn't have a chance to fight against us were in the images, so thanks a lot, you saved us a lot of time. We stopped our chaining op and started looking what they were doing. It was about 17ET and they started logging off. At the same time we started to plan how we could screw their plans big time and started calling members online. Pretty much from starting point we agreed that moving stuff out of there isn't worth it and biggest reward is to screw their success because they were bragging about it before they had anything in safe. There were a few Martyr's dudes closing their static hole but we held our fire until 20ET. 


We killed their Hurricane (http://kossu.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=17614073) and Typhoon (http://kossu.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=17614071). Next thing to do, rapecage their POS and reinforce it. They had maximum stront in it, so we got a really nice timer for it, Monday 14ET. After that we onlined our own POS for safe and fittings etc. No Holes Barred opened a wormhole to our own C5, they noticed us inside C3 and they closed our own C5 to C3 connection. We got most of our needed stuff inside C3 but we could've used a bit more.


Around 00ET or something around that time Martyr's dudes started logging in again. They started self destructing their ships. Of course the most logical cash out from Rorqual and Archon is to self destruct them if they're inside C3. They also self destructed a bunch of BS , Faction BS etc. totalling about 25 total BS. We killed one Guardian which slowboated too far away from shields (http://kossu.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=17619317). We could've got all of that stuff for five billion ISK but we declined that offer. Almost everything what can be seen in Martyr's screenshots were selfdestructed by them, some of the self destructs can be seen here: http://imgur.com/a/zd5wq#81


[ 2013.05.05 00:42:32 ] Leggsakimbo &gt; Shifting sands, shit happens. We got smug to early. Would rather we killed them than you


POS timer was for Monday around 14ET, we logged in straight after servers went up after patching and started destroying the POS. We destroyed it and everything what was left there, three Legions and bunch of crap (http://kossu.eve-kill.net/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=17646433).


----


TL;DR: Martyr's Vengence did a heist and they started bragging about it before they had anything in safe. We got really lucky and found a route to that system by accident. Killed and podded a few of them, made them to self destruct almost everything and finally destroyed their POS and what was left there. Of course they got something out of there but in any case, they are mad = op success.",,False,,t5_2qil9,False,,,True,t3_1dsusw,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1dsusw/didnt_need_those_ships_anyway_remember_martyrs/,

I helped take Delve, as well as defend it. I have seen ups and downs, and the transformation of a strong,  fun alliance into what can only be described as a slowly burning ship.

TEST used to be a fun environment, that was always pvp focused and down to take fights.  The leadership was steady (read Montolio). 

Over the course of the last 8 months,  I saw the alliance that I loved turn into a haven for J4Gs, terrible posters, and apathetic line members. 

What is the cause of this? Culture. 

TEST had a habit of constantly demeaning and devaluing the content creators, and pushing out those who wanted to fight the wanton autism. The departure of PL, along with many of the old powerhouse corps over the last 8 months have shown that TEST's previous supporters were sick of it. Personally, I couldn't handle the blatant disrespect for the content creators, that I left and joined nulli in april.

With the end of the Fountain war, we can finally see that TEST cannot operate as a solo entity.  Many corps/active pvpers have left, leaving a hollow shell of a once great alliance. 

TEST currently has no plan, no real leadership besides Booda, and no capability to defend itself.

TEST is dead. I can't see the alliance ever reaching its former level. Some say TEST has been dying ever since the dissolution of the HBC, but to me, TEST has been a corpse for months now.

Ps. This will probably be downvotes into oblivion, but I know there are plenty of ex-Test bros who agree with me",,False,,t5_2qil9,False,,guristas,True,t3_1k4jlz,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1k4jlz/why_test_is_dead/,

Sitting on EVE, POS spinning while Pocurk and Cleaver Boneclaw argue and roll the static.

We connect to J172431. Intel shows spikes of activity at 24, 48 and 72 hours ago. After a little talk it is decided to spend some time and deploy a carrier trap. The basis for this idea is a cloak fit carrier is jumped into the hostile system and cloaked within jump range of the worm hole. When the hostiles attempt to collapse the hole with capitals you decloak and jump the friendly carrier back to your home system, trapping their capital with you and resulting in an easy kill.

This time things did not go as planned. Minutes after the carrier was in position and cloaked a hostile scout was spotted. The locals proceeded to scan their system and shortly after poked through to our home system. After a short wait, they warped a dread, two battleships and an orca to our worm hole and jumped through. I decloaked my carrier, piloted by Avord Anderson and waited for our scout to jump home. This was my mistake. Our scout jumped, and when I tried to I got the no go error message. The hostile orca and battle ships had returned and collapsed the hole. The Revelation dreadnought was trapped in our home system, but I was now trapped with an archon in the hostile system, uncloaked, next to two battleships.

I wasted no time and initiated warp to another wormhole we had scanned in system. The hostiles were too fast for my lumbering carrier and I was soon warp scrambled. I quickly deployed fighters to try and drive them off, but with the low skilled character, it was slow progress. Then the onyx landed. This ship turned out to be the bane of my existence over the next 10 minutes. The bubble went up just as I got a typhoon to structure, it managed to warp just in time.

It was now apparent that I was in a lot of trouble. Clever Boneclaw wasted no time and sprang into action, going into another wormhole in system and looking for a Kspace exit. 

Back in our home system the hostile Revelation was quickly dispatched.
http://www.elysianempire.com/kb/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=4695
Once this was dealt with, the people in our home system started looking for the new static. The plan was to find a K-space exit and try to come save my ass.

Meanwhile my aggressors have started to primary my fighters and I am unable to drive them off. Numbers are growing and there is now a Proteus, Onyx and a scorpion at range. I am not going anywhere fast. Slowly the numbers increase. Tempest, Abaddon, Drake and a Bhaalgorn. I am tanking the fleet, capacitor regen is keeping up under neuts from the Bhaalgorn and the Typhoon which returns, I assume after repairing.

I play with them a little, letting my armor drop to around 10%, before hitting triage, repairing to full armor, and then dropping again.

At one point a Purifier lands on grid and starts orbiting inside the Onyx bubble. I see a change to have some fun and spend nearly a full minute trying to lock it. As soon as I get lock I deploy my trust Hobgoblin II’s, managing to ruin the Purifiers day.
http://www.elysianempire.com/kb/?a=kill_detail&amp;kll_id=4696

Then things start to go south for me. As I am starting to get low on armor the bubble drops for a moment, then going back up. Then a hostile Moros lands at point blank on my Archon. I am pretty sure this is the end. With my Archon setup and character skills, I can barely tank 10k DPS in triage. A well fit Moros should be putting out around 12K DPS with an average blaster fit. That, coupled with the other ships on field, which now includes an Armageddon, I was certain I would not last long. I drop into triage and watch as my armor bounces between 5% and 20%. But it holds.

At this point a Kspace exit has been found in the hostile chian. Another exit has been found from the home system. 24 jumps. A friendly fleet is rallied and starts burning at best speed. 

Amazingly my tank is holding. Both my local reps are running, and I dare not drop triage to blap another purifier that lands on grid.

A boosting character that was in high sec already makes it to the hole and starts boosting from a safe in system. My tank starts to look a lot better, and when the Moros reloads I manage to hit 100% armor again. Capacitor is holding at about 50-55%.

Now confident I can tank the fleet, my house mate and I start coming up with stupid shit to say and try to provoke the hostiles in local chat. You know…to keep them interested. 

1 Hour and 10 minutes after the hole initially collapsed, the rescue fleet jumps into system. The fleet warps to my Archon and proceeds to teach some very valuable lessons to our new friends.
http://www.elysianempire.com/kb/?a=kill_related&amp;kll_id=4704

8.3 Billion isk in damage later and I am feeling amazing. Nothing like a nail biting experience to get the heart pumping.

I would like to thank all my friends in Bite Me Inc and Elysian Empire for coming to save my ass. Special thanks to the scanners who found the routes, especially Cleaver Boneclaw.

Lelouch updated a post last month regarding multiboxing to reiterate the EULA, which legitimate multiboxers agree to and we mutually promote.

For me the current atmosphere feels like WoW in 2008. Blizzard banned bots that happened to use my software, and I had some discussions with them and in the end, they still ban bots and are not banning people for simply using ISBoxer. The botters simply don't trust me to protect them from Blizzard (or CCP in this case), because it would be counter-productive for me to do that. There's a lot more multiboxers than people who want to risk botting, and most botters will screw you (me) in a heartbeat. So it is an easy business decision for me to support multiboxers and not botters in any case...

Most of my customers are big fans of the games they play, and pay extra just to keep playing, because they enjoy the hobby, and are not interested in getting banned. Just playing their accounts together and having some interesting toys to play with, like being able to see or control another window without alt+tabbing from the one they are playing.

**Thank you CCP for so far directing your wrath at the bots rather than multiboxers.**

I'm hoping that my $1000 EVE multiboxing video contest [http://youtu.be/DR2Iqha7huo](http://youtu.be/DR2Iqha7huo) will help show how boring it really is, or conversely why people are actually excited about what I spend my time creating for them. 

I've been in business since 2004 as a small independent software publisher at lavishsoft.com, promoting gaming-related tools that hopefully are used for good.

CEO Update: The Madness of Montolio


This is an extraordinarily awkward update to write, because I'm about to burn a bridge. Actually, let's be realistic - this bridge set itself on fire many months ago, and it's only now that I've given up trying to pretend that we have any kind of relationship with Montolio other than his seething, passive-aggressive hostility towards GSF and the CFC. As you know, things have been batshit with TEST the past few days, ever since they openly announced a desire to kill off our neighbor in Fade, Fatal Ascension, while under the protection of positive standings.

The literal sum of the drama is this: Bring Stabity, TEST's diplo to the CFC, announces that Montolio plans to try to instigate FA into attacking TEST so that TEST can kill off FA while still blue to the CFC. This is problematic. However, we have tried to err on the side of gentleness when it comes to Montolio's antics, and so we just removed the HBC from GFAllies, our shared jabber channel for allied leadership. As responses to ""we are planning on killing your neighbor and ally who you share a border with"" go, this seems pretty tame. Given that Montolio's spat with FA had already queered the dynamic of the channel to where our allies didn't feel comfortable talking in there, this was probably going to be necessary even if the ""We're trying to kill FA under your nose, lololol"" stuff from Monty hadn't come out so directly.

Does this seem like a petty drama to you? It does to me, as well. And yet we are on the verge of a massive all-nullsec bloc war because of this: the passive-aggressive behavior of one alliance leader, culminating in an explosion of triviality. 

After being removed from the GFAllies channel due to his threats against FA, Montolio lost his shit. Where we made no public announcement of these changes, Montolio posted a sticky thread on the TEST forums and broadcast to his entire alliance about what had transpired; he also removed every CFC jabber account from TEST's servers. Since this took place, Monty has issued an increasingly erratic series of jabber broadcasts, mostly relating to a bunch of people eager to kill us joining forces with him: 

&gt; Expect to see some N3, NeoCurse, and potentially Solar Fleet people on jabber in coming weeks.

&gt; Please do not copy any fleet broadcasts into a public room.

&gt; ---


&gt; Progodlegend and Gorga of S2N are already on jabber who else is coming?

&gt; [4:43:45 PM] Vince Draken: I will send LadyScarlet

(We note that Solar and N3 are at war with one another in Cache, and these all-broadcasts on TEST jabber from Montolio are clearly intended to spook or intimidate the CFC, or boost Monty's confidence, or something.)

Tonight we've seen a bunch of Kugu posting by Montolio, and instead of it being about FA, he has apparently decided to vent his spleen about how awful Goonswarm was for daring to help out in Delve during the SoCo campaign: 

&gt; With regards to Goonswarm insisting on owning a few 'defensive systems' in Delve &amp; Querious - Goonswarm has a huge trust issue. The monolithic approach to the entire coalition alienates anyone that wants to be independent. Check each CFC region, you are likely going to find at least one Goonswarm staging area. It took us over a year to get PNQY in Fountain, which they literally never used. One of the big reasons that Goonswarm can attempt to take credit for campaigns is because they refuse to integrate allies within campaign command or fleet command positions. Goon skymarshals, Goon FCs.

&gt; It works, but it sucks sometimes. Goonswarm aid always comes with preconditions.

There are more similar posts; these came after a missive yesterday called ""FA Shot First"" written by Montolio, blaming FA for starting all of this - some kind of spat with BDEAL, an alliance you have all no doubt forgotten, over a year ago, a controversy that no one has talked about at all until Montolio needed to find an excuse for his extreme behavior. His motive is transparent; in response to being separated from GFAllies for announcing an intention to kill FA, Montolio kneejerked and kicked the CFC off his jabber, wrote a screed about how it was all FA's fault anyway due to forgotten year+ old drama, and is now tag-teaming on Kugu with his trusty second-in-command Rob3r about how this is somehow all back to GSF being awful. We've had to deal with years of this kind of passive-aggressive crap from Monty, and things have seemingly reached a point of no return.

**What In The Everliving Fuck Is Going On?**

Montolio could be an evil space mastermind and this is all part of his grand plan to bring about our downfall. More likely, he could be erratic by nature and spoiled by TEST's position in nullsec politics, leading to behavior like a tantrum-prone child. Here are some possibilities:

He could be malicious: attempting to kill one of our strongest allies under our noses, while surrounding himself with allies which are vehemently hostile towards GSF, such as Raiden (who he gave space to in Querious) and 'N3', the new home of Nulli Secunda and Northern Coalitiondot, both of whom starred in recent Eve Online dramas the denouement of which involved ignominious retreat for the anti-CFC forces, setting up a classic divide, surround and conquer strategy re: us. However, this requires a fair degree of long-range planning on Monty's part, and I think this theory is probably just me being exceptionally paranoid. Let us be charitable, for a moment. 

He could be bonkers: his reactions to events have been completely outsized, overreactions and escalations on a grand scale. His behavior has been unpredictable and erratic, and in fact he is well known for this. While ""dude is fucking nuts, who knows"" is kind of a cop-out as explanations go, it's a pretty solid contender, considering how often his goals and narratives (FA shot first! No wait, Goonswarm is at fault! etc) shift. 

He could be spoiled: We helped Montolio take Fountain, and with PL helped take Delve, Querious and Period Basis; when we went home after one of his tantrums, PL helped prosecute the war against the SoCo to its final conclusion. When Montolio wanted tech moons, we gave him our own. When Montolio began his protracted slapfight with Fatal Ascension, we did little more than say 'play nice now' and turned a blind eye. When Montolio accused us of trying to use our jump bridge systems in Fountain of being ~secret staging areas to destroy TEST~ (PNQY, J5A) we gave them to him; when he decided that he didn't want us to help defend Delve from the W-4 constellation, we handed over every system in the region to him and shrugged it off. 

In almost every situation I can think of, the strategy of 'escalate and throw a tantrum' has worked for Montolio when he gets into a conflict; he does not appear to know how to deescalate a situation or calm down, and as long as PL or the CFC was there to back him up, this kind of strategy worked a charm against a number of enemies - until he tried the same on a CFC member. 

To my knowledge, ""No, you can't hang out in GFAllies while plotting to kill off FA, sorry"" is the first time we have said ""no"" to Montolio, and he has completely flipped shit about it - like a spoiled six year old child punching and kicking because he couldn't get a fourth lollipop today. Perhaps this is a monster of our own creation, by being so accommodating over the years; regardless, it is clear that reason, negotiation, and reconciliation are not options, as everything so far has only accelerated his penchant for psychodrama and petty lashing-out. 

**What about TEST?**

We like TEST. We helped bring them safely into a nullsec that tried to kill us, in the same place; while Reddit and SA might have their spats, as line members go we are fairly similar when compared with the rest of Eve who have no 'mother forum' to call home. We have no quarrel with the line members of TEST. We get along peachy with folks like Durrhurrdurr and Walter Stine, and my best friend in Madison is the CEO of a corp in TEST. Half of my silly website is staffed by loyal TEST members. That makes this situation tremendously awkward: our problems with TEST pretty much just come down to ""Montolio is a passive aggressive child"", and the guy seems intent on driving us all into some kind of foreverwar with Every Alliance We Beat The Shit Out Of In The Last Four Years as his darling ~friends and allies~.

Right now Montolio seems to think - or is claiming to anyone who will listen - that GSF is getting ready to invade TEST. We are not, and that would be retarded for a whole host of reasons - not only do we not need the space, it's a coinflip if we could even win, and most importantly we like TEST's membership. In reaction to this nonexistent invasion, Montolio seems to be running around Eve rallying forces against us while we are still nominally allies - all for our terrible sin of quietly separating him from FA, who he plotted to destroy, in a jabber channel. It is difficult to get past how laughably petty the instigating event of all of this drama is. 

TEST is a member of OTEC, so even if Montolio drinks more Kool-aid and resets us we will not be attacking his tech moons (the techs which we gifted to TEST) unless he launches an actual attack on us. 

It's clear that we basically cannot deal with Montolio on any level, and will conduct all our TEST diplomacy (what little left there is to do) via junior diplos, and leave him to his hobbies of concocting obscure resentments, being bitter as hell about GSF, and plotting our doom. TEST has not been removed from our jabber or our forums, and we will keep them blue and hope that this fit of madness passes, and/or someone will give the screaming child a lollipop already before our eardrums rupture.",,False,,t5_2qil9,False,,,True,t3_171jlj,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/171jlj/gsf_ceo_update_the_madness_of_montolio/,

[image](http://content.eveonline.com/www/newssystem/media/64897/1/HodorvsMammoth.png)

Hello, I'm CCP Rise. Im kind of new here, but you may know me from EVE where I controlled the honorable Kil2 in space combat for the last 6 or 7 years along with being an Alliance Tournament commentator, podcast host, and YouTuber. Since arriving here in the frigid north my biggest contribution to EVE development thus far has been to the battleship rebalance, which I took the lead on, but I have a lot more to do and I want to talk to you about my latest project! Industrials!

Lets start with an important tl;dr:

*  Industrials got a major makeover and many of them perform much differently than before
*  We are renaming the Iteron, Iteron Mark II, Iteron Mark III, Iteron Mark IV, and Badger Mark II


Before I get into *what* we actually did, I want to share a little bit about *why* we did it.

Some of you may ask, CCP Rise, why are you balancing industrials, they are fine, go do something important like deleting falcons from the game (I kind of agree with you), so let me explain. As CCP Ytterbium so graciously details in the blog [here](http://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/74234), we changed a lot of the skill requirements for commanding space faring vessels in *Odyssey*, and industrials were heavily affected. With all industrials only requiring the relevant racial industrial skill at level I (rather than a range from level I to level V), any trace of decision making was replaced with an obligation to use the Iteron Mark V.  That, along with the fact that many of the haulers were pointless even before *Odyssey*, made them prime pickings for a rebalance.

Getting these ships finished and ready to ship was quite the process and while I cant recount it all here, I recommend catching up in the Features and Ideas section of the forums where you can see the [version one](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=250079&amp;find=unread) thread, which had a huge impact on the final design, or go look through all the specifics of the final implementation in the [version two](https://forums.eveonline.com/default.aspx?g=posts&amp;t=252819&amp;find=unread) thread! For me, this effort represents a huge success in terms of cooperation with the community to make the best choices for the game. I found myself not only our forums, but also posting on [Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1gneiq/odyssey_11_tech_1_industrials_rebalance/?sort=confidence), talking constantly with the [CSM](http://community.eveonline.com/community/csm/) (who are awesome and consistently steered us in the right direction), spending time in [Twitch.tv](http://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/EVE%20Online) stream chat with players and even arguing with DJ FunkyBacon from EVE Radio at 4am. All of it culminated in the resolution of Mammoth-gate, a set of industrials with a lot more character, and a more interesting class of ships overall.

In case you dont want to go get all the details from the forum thread, heres some highlights on the rebalance:

* Like combat classes, industrials have been divided into roles rather than tiers.
* Each race will have one cargo-focused industrial (which can actually compete with Iteron Mark V for carrying space).
* Each race will have one industrial focused on travel time and resilience.
* We are introducing industrials with specialized bays


o   The Hoarder (HODOR!) will have a bay that carries anything in the charge group, including ammo, bombs, nanite paste, cap booster charges, etc.

o   The Kyros will have a dedicated bay for minerals

o   The Epithal will have a dedicated bay for planetary commodities

o   The Miasmos will have a dedicated bay for asteroid ore, ice ore and gas

* We also tried to give each industrial something special to set it apart from the pack, whether that means the fastest travel time (Wreathe), the largest cargo bay (Tayra), or even things like drone bays (Nereus) or missile launchers (Badger and Tayra)!


So now with that out of the way, I need to tell you about one of the most important elements of this rebalance that you might have already picked up on: NEW NAMES.  With a move towards roles, which are meant to make each ship different and valuable, rather than a tier system which is about progression, it no longer fits to have the Badger and Iteron lines named in progression-based way. Many players raised this point in the feedback thread and I told them we wouldnt do it because of how disruptive it could be, but after more internal discussion we decided that there was too much tension between their names and their function. There will be some growing pains as we all get used to seeing these names on our overviews, but in the long run it will be a huge improvement.

CCP Abraxas did an amazing job creating the new names, and he even gave me detailed explanations for the origin of each one.  Enjoy:

By itself, Iteron means a specific kind of repetitive pattern of DNA within a bacterial cell. As such, we decided to focus on general themes of organics, base materials, repetition and patterns.

Iteron to **Nereus**

Nereus is a Greek sea god with a rich heritage, the oldest of several sons, and a shapeshifter - perfect for an original hauler that later saw several siblings/variations. And it's fitting that this is the only hauler with a drone bay, because Nereus was the father of the fifty Nereids, a small army of nimble and quick sea nymphs.

Iteron Mk. II to **Kryos**

This one in particular is a mineral hauler, and the term for a pattern or order of minerals is crystal. If you dive down enough, the Greek root of that word eventually beomes Kruos. That particular name is too similar to Cruor (we don't want to muck up someone's target calling in lowsec), but as it happens, the pronunciation of Kruos actually became more akin Kryos as the Egyptians and Byzanthians picked it up, so there we go.

Iteron Mk. III to **Epithal**

Here we're dealing with a motley of different materials, but there's a definite feel of life to them - not just in the strictly biological parts like bacteria, proteins, fertilizer and livestock, but also in the number of compounds that, while not strictly speaking biological, are very much prone to activity if they are exposed to the wrong element. So, we're thinking ordered cells, and something that needs protection. The name for an order or pattern of cells is tissue. One of the basic tissue types is called epithelium, and it's primarily in charge of protecting its contents from outside influences, and keeping them stable through whatever means necessary. It's a perfect metaphor for the containment vats you'd need on a PI-focused vessel. Go back in time a little, muck about with the roots of the word, and you end up with the variant Epithal.

Iteron Mk. IV to **Miasmos**

This one carries ore, which means ice, minerals and gas. We've pretty much covered the first two with the Kryos name, so we decided to have some fun with gas. A miasma is a gaseous contagion - actually one of the first on record, from Greek mythology; and as we tend to sometimes mythologize Gallente ship names, it was a good fit. Another candidate was Atreus, the dude who actually caused the plague by doing some horrible things (seriously, [look him up](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atreus)), but it's far too similar to the Atron; so Miasmos it is.

**Iteron Mark V**

We arent changing the name on the Mark V.  This was the best version of the former line of Iterons, it was the most used of the five, and it is changing very little in this balance pass.  For these reasons we feel that both the story and the design are supported by leaving the name intact.

Badger Mk. II to **Tayra**

Badgers belong to the sizeable weasel family, which includes anything from the Hairy-Nosed Otter to the Wolverine. A Tayra is a rather clever kind of badger-type weasel.

Thats a warning.",2JokersWild,157,25,45,http://www.reddit.com/r/Eve/comments/1hywf8/when_we_put_your_corpse_on_your_side_of_the_wh/,"I think the most interesting point of wormholes is the randomness. Every day really is something entirely different. Some days your static connection sucks and you dont have people on line to quickly roll it. Sometimes you have a great static exit that puts you close to a trade hub so you deal with the logistics of keeping things running. Some days its LS and pew pew, null and roaming.....But you really never know. If you are the type of guy who has your day planned to the hour and week to the day, wormholes might present a bit of a step outside your comfort zone.


Today ended up being that ""Meh HS, haul time"" day. Around 13 or so from Jita. We rally the haulers and get the PI and array outputs consolidated into the HS exit, buy orders put together for materials, goo, ammo and fuel to keep us in business for another few weeks and get the freighter on the move from Jita. 


We've no more than webbed the freighter into its last warp to the station in our HS exit when we get a new sig in the Bat Cave. Damnit, getting a new sig during a hauling op is worse than getting a knock on the front door when you're having sex. Cause you just know that means the wife is home and forgot her keys.


Our scanners lock it quick, and as expected its a wormhole. An Anathema momentarily pops up on dscan, then disappears. Our scout jumps through, and its a C5. The hostile 'Thema comes back from our side and we all get a chuckle as our scout says ""Hey look at this"" and shows us the corpse of the pilot whos currently in the Anathema. Seems this guy has recently fallen to us! We decide maybe a warning is in order as we are busy and really dont want to muck about with these guys. Our scout drops the corpse by the wormhole. Thats as much of a ""Hi"" and a ""Piss off"" as you can get I would figure. 


We leave the haulers in HS and pod to our C5 real quick. Our scout finds the POS with the Anathema there as well as a few ships and 1 other pilot. Loki, few BC's, few caps. About what a guy would expect. A Buzzard heads out from the POS back to our C5. He scans down the C2 and jumps out. Apparently the corpse didnt send the right message.....


We decide to green light a roll hole op. Carrier, Orca, Navy Mega, Scorpion and Talos light warp drives and head out. We shove the Carrier out with an Orca close behind. Our scout jumps back, followed by the Orca and lastly the Carrier. Hole disappears. B-E-A utiful. 


Our scout decides to get crafty and stays parked right where that WH used to be. I warp out to grab a fast tackle Ceptor. I switch ships real quick and fire up the warp drive back to the recently collapsed wormhole. 


As if it was scripted, that Buzzard comes up on dscan, then disappears. Theres an above average chance hes cloaked and in warp to a now dead link back home. Well then, lets say hi.....


The Buzzard comes out of warp at 0 to the dead wormhole and right on top of our scout. Who as expected causes the cloak to drop, and not a second later a Raptor comes out of warp with guns hot and points primed....
