Keep those routers clean!,,12,0,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyTechSupport/comments/n9xi1/a_little_wireless_networking_advice_keep_those/,"So, everyone knows you're supposed to clean your ethernet cables once a month. If this operation is not performed, you will notice massive slowdown due to your cords being clogged with excess ones. Zeroes are technically nothing, so they don't leave anything behind.

But did you know, wireless routers suffer from this issue as well? Even invisible data leaves behind residue when it travels. This also explains packet loss being more common on wireless networks. The worst offenders here are the antenna, which trap and lock these errant ones like you wouldn't believe. 

Common cleaning procedure is as follows:

1. Unplug your router.
2. Remove the antenna.
2. If your router has an internal antenna, the best way to get at it is with a golf club and some elbow grease.
3. Wipe down the inside of the antenna with a soft cloth (If using an Apple router, you'll need Apple's proprietary cloth) and replace the casing.
4. Plug your router back in and reboot your computer six times. This is to make sure the computer realizes that you're not happy with all that data it just leaves lying around, and get the message across that you want it to clean up after itself instead of just being a shitty roommate *GREG*.

After that, you should be all ready to go and back on the internet at blazing speed! Good luck and happy computing!",,False,,t5_2t2dc,True,,,True,t3_n9xi1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyTechSupport/comments/n9xi1/a_little_wireless_networking_advice_keep_those/,

Nearly 50% of them are able to install the Delta Search-Toolbar, so just go on Google and bash into your keyboard.
There is a high likelyhood, that you will find a so called ""Delta-Fucker"" on the first link.

If not, click on the second.

When you find one, download and start the Installer.

Whether you accept the Delta Search Toolbar or not, it will be installed anyway. So save time and just click on ""Next"".

When your unknown program is installed, you can now uninstall it again. Or let the crap be installed, it's not my Business what the fuck you're doing with your PC.

Now start your Internet Browser. Let us assume, you're using Chrome.

On your first page you see something, that may harm your eyes.
It resembles Google, accept for the Logo. It's Delta Search. 

Be Happy. If so, than you don't know what you've done.

When you want to search something using the URL Bar, you won't be redirected to Google as normally, but to Delta Search.

Be Happy. If so, than you are unable to learn.

.

Uninstall Delta Search:

Now move your mouse to the three Lines on the upper right corner. Also called ""Options"".

Now go on ""Settings"" --&gt; ""On startup"" and click on ""Set pages"". You will see something called ""Delta Search"". Click on the cross. Now it shouldn't be your first page anymore.

Don't leave the Setting. You have to go on ""Search"" and click ""Manage search engines..."".
Make Google a default and click on the cross on ""Delta Search"".
Now using the URL Bar to search, should bring up Google instead of Delta Search.

Restart Chrome. Look on your first site. See Delta Search. Scream. Vomit like a lawn sprinkler.

Go back to Settings and see, Delta Search is back.

Restart the process 3 to 5 times, till you realize it doesn't help. Freak out a little. Get over it.

Click your Windows Start-Button and go to ""Windows Control Panel"" --&gt; ""uninstall Programm"" and find the Delta ""Fucking"" Toolbar. Uninstall it.

Start Chrome. Restart the process before. It doesn't work. Bash into your keyboard again. Scream: ""FUUUUCK!!! Fuck you. You Fucking Delta Fuck. Noone likes you you fucking Fucknut.""

Take your Keyboard in your Hands and hit your screen while crying.

Now open your window, take your PC in both hands and throw it out.

Understand why it's called Windows. (Even when it's not it's fault.)

Now you're done. Delta Search should be uninstalled properly now.

Go to sleep crying.

I mean seriously, it would be like a switch that could reach a radius of 50 miles or more without wires! And it would work better in cities and mountainous areas where access is difficult for telecoms.

Better yet we could bounce the signals off the moon at night and provide wider coverage!

Other tips inside,RealModeX86,8,1,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ShittyTechSupport/comments/17g9r5/dont_have_a_grounded_outlet_for_your_desktop_pc/,"The third prong normally hooks the computer up to a phone connection, so don't try this if you still use dialup. It's legacy hardware, and we don't need it! 

You can also do ""overclocking"" and ""voltage modding"" like some people do. I'll help you with these as follows:
1. Overclocking:
You can overclock by simply changing the time in the right click menu on your taskbar. If you put your computer in the future, it'll automatically be able to access ram from the future, or ""Virtual RAM"". If you go too far, the system will crash because it won't be able to support the ""Intel photonic maxiboost"" extensions that are needed. 
2. Volt modding:
In places where the household voltage 'mains' is 120v, you can overvolt on most power supplies by simply flipping the voltage select switch on the power supply. This gives your computer more power, which you will see as speed. Sometimes the computer gets hotter when you do this, so that brings me to the final tip:
3. Water cooling:
Just buy a fish tank off craigslist, and put the whole case in there, then fill it with salt water. This is important. Salt prevents electricity from flowing.

The Problem: The notebook goes to HP Recovery Manager when booted

Critical Information(Skip to last sentence for important info) : Last night, I was testing out BackBox 3.05 by downloading it off their site and writing it to a USB drive. After trying it out, I decided to install it alongside Windows 7 without VirtualBox. Before this, I had no other OS on my notebook. After going through the installation steps, I came to the last step: choosing the installation type. I chose the device /dev/sda2 ,type swap, no mount point, no format, size 480190 MB, 0 MB used (HDD has 2 users on it with a considerable amount of files on it). I then clicked on the 'Change...' button below the 'Format?' checkboxes. An 'Edit Partition' box came up and I changed the partition size in the dialog box (which was in the 7-digit values) to an approximate 6-digit value. I changed the 'Use as:' to swap area and didn't change the mount point. I clicked install now then a box prompted me that I hadn't defined a root filesystem. I then somehow chose one (it was late; I don't remember how or which) then clicked install now, then realised I shouldn't install it before I knew what I was doing and quit the installation. I then powered down the laptop down and went to sleep. The next morning, I booted up the laptop and saw the words 'Windows is loading files...' with a progress bar underneath. It then goes to HP Recovery manager after running Startup Repair. I don't have the option to restore my notebook to an earlier date, or file backup. An important piece of information is that in the Startup Repair, viewing diagnostic repair details say ' Root cause found: System volume on disk is corrupt.

TL;DR: My Notebook of 2 years sends me to HP Recovery Manager after I made some changes to the partitions in a Linux Distro. The root cause seems to be 'system volume on disk is corrupt' according to Startup Repair.
