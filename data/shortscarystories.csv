You do not know who I am, but I know you. I am one of the three demons that were assigned to you at birth. You see, some people in this world are destined for greatness, destined to live happy, fulfilling lives. You, I am afraid, are not one of those people, and it is our job to make sure of that. 

Who are we? Oh yes, of course, how rude of me. Allow me to introduce us:

*Shame* is my younger brother, the demon on your left shoulder. Shame tells you that you’re a freak; that those thought you have are not normal; that you will never fit in. Shame whispered into your ear when your mother found you playing with yourself as a child. Shame is the one who makes you hate yourself.                                            
*Fear* sits on your right shoulder. He is my older brother, as old as life itself. Fear fills every dark corner with monsters, turns every stranger on a dark street into a murderer. Fear stops you from telling your crush how you feel. He tells you it is better not to try than let people see you fail. Fear makes you build your own prison.

Who am I, then? I am the worst of your demons, but you see me as a friend. You turn to me when you have nothing else, because I live in your heart. I am the one who forces you to endure. The one who prolongs your torment.

Sincerely,

*Hope.*

He goes to bed at ten, every night. He says goodbye to his friends on the Internet and shuts his laptop down, like clockwork, and then he changes out of his clothes and goes to bed. He dreams, but never remembers what about. When he wakes up in the morning, he's always slept in, and he hurries to get to school in time. He gets home at thirty six minutes past three and does his homework, and then he returns to his laptop until bed. He likes gummy bears, horror films and music that has screamed vocals. He doesn't really have any friends apart from me, so he keeps some weed in his sock drawer for when the loneliness gets too much. He doesn't know what he wants to do after school, but he knows he wants to go and live in a big city. London, maybe. He's so sad because he doesn't realise how beautiful he is. I don't know what I'd be if I didn't love him like I do. I was nothing before him.

We've lived together for twelve months now, it's nice. I used to be one of those faceless people he speaks to online, until we both realised that we couldn't live with being so far away from each other. I moved to the other end of the country to be with him, I made so many sacrifices and I don't regret it at all. His parents are nice, but we just spent most of the time up in his room alone. We don't talk like we used to before I moved in, though. Most of the time I just watch him. It's how I know so much about him.

Tonight, his routine's changed. He doesn't touch the laptop, he just lies on his bed with his face in the pillow and cries. I was concerned, until I looked at his calendar and realised the date. Of course he's upset; it's been a year since I hanged myself.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,False,,,True,t3_18whyi,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/18whyi/i_know_him_so_well/,

It was an ordinary grey plastic wristwatch in every respect except for the fact that it was counting down. ""That is all of the time you have left in the world, son. Use it wisely."" And indeed he did. As the watch ticked away, the boy, now a man, lived life to the fullest. He climbed mountains and swam oceans. He talked and laughed and lived and loved. The man was never afraid, for he knew exactly how much time he had left.

Eventually, the watch began its final countdown. The old man stood looking over everything he had done, everything he had built. *5*. He shook hands with his old business partner, the man who had long been his friend and confidant. *4*. His dog came and licked his hand, earning a pat on the head for its companionship. *3*. He hugged his son, knowing that he had been a good father. *2*. He kissed his wife on the forehead one last time. *1*. The old man smiled and closed his eyes.

Then, nothing happened. The watch beeped once and turned off. The man stood standing there, very much alive. You would think that in that moment he would have been overjoyed. Instead, for the first time in his life, the man was scared.

They set up camp in the woods nearby and spent the evening swimming in the warm, clear water. As the sun sunk below the trees, one of the friends went up to the highest point on the cliff and jumped off, while the other 5 watched. Their laughter slowly subsided as they waited for him to surface. It only took half a minute for them to dive in after their friend. Struggling and sputtering among the reeds in the lagoon, they searched hopelessly for him. Finally they disentangled themselves and came up, but they never saw their friend again. Heartbroken they returned to the city and passed a strange and lonely year in which their only solace was the knowledge that they would return to the lagoon to honour the anniversary of their friend's death. 

A year passed and they returned to the lagoon as a memorial, but as they approached they saw their friend standing there, head bowed. Excitedly they called to him and began running towards him, but he didn't turn. As they got closer they called him more desparately, but still to no avail. With joy they ran towards him, but stopped dead when they saw not one but five crosses on the waterside.

We’ll begin it with the long curling locks that frame his face like a portrait. He is handsome but humble, speaks little of himself, and is unflinchingly truthful at all times. Naturally, the ladies of the land are quite taken with him, and the Queen most of all. She makes him her lover, thrilled to be called beautiful by such an honest young man.

She is a vain queen, though, known to summon dark powers in hopes of warding off age. After gifting her lover with eternal youth, she discovers one cannot give such gifts to oneself – when she tries, the dark powers rebound upon her, twisting her. Not outwardly, but her heart is turned cold, and if ever she looks at her own reflection, her vision is made to fracture and facet like that of a greedy fly. Unable to see the truth with her own eyes now, the more her lover calls her beautiful, the more she suspects he is lying.

Eventually, in a fit of anger at his mockery, she pushes our hero from a tower window. Her bewitchments ensure he does not die, but a thousand shards of glass pierce his body and he shatters every bone as he crashes through the mirrored dome above her throne room and falls to its marble floor. The spiteful queen has him run through with a hook and hung on a wall to set an example, and it’s only then, when she catches sight of her many reflections in the jagged glass splinters impaling his limp form, that she sees she *is* still beautiful. And forever after, she will believe him when she asks, “Who is the fairest in the land?”

It was a black box, sealed with clear tape and had a white UPS Next Day Air label.   I was curious. I brought the box in, set it on the coffee table and then, using the key to my car, cut open the tape. 

Inside the box were the following things:

- A full black face mask with holes for the eyes and mouth cut out 
- A roll of duct tape
- A length of brown rope (probably six feet long)
- A length of wire (twice as long as the rope)
- A pack of razor blades
- A working flashlight
- A box of matches
- A can of lighter fluid
- A small crowbar
- A pair of handcuffs
- A big knife (with a blade that was sharp on one edge and serrated on the other) in a leather sheath 
- A legal sized white envelope stuffed full with twenty dollar bills
- A photo of me 

Immediately went to grab my phone to call the cops when the doorbell rang. I was a little freaked out, so I slid on the chain before I opened it. I didn't recognize the guy standing there; he said he was the nephew of my next door neighbors and he was staying with them for a little while.  He said that he came over because he'd just gotten off the phone with UPS; it seems the package he was expecting from New Mexico this morning was mistakenly addressed with my house number.

you may have asked yourself where I've been the last week. Do you remember when mom used to tell Ami and me about our ""family curse"" when we were little girls? Well, I did some research and... she was *right*. I visited the graveyard and browsed the family history: every female seems to have died at the same age: 29 years and four days. Mom was ran over at exactly this age, you know? And when Ami drowned last year she was that old too. It continues like that throughout our history: Murders, accidents, diseases. Apparently none died earlier and none later. Creepy, right?
To come straight to the point: You know that I'm a little superstitious. I turned 29 yesterday and met a soldier at the party who says he could smuggle me into a military bunker. I mean, where could it be safer? I promise I'll return in a few days, I just wanted to make sure that ""curse"" is nonsense.

He’s going to find a parking ticket on his car when he leaves work, and then his wife is going to yell at him when he gets home.  I make a mental note to leave him an extra big tip.

I can see the future of the little girl at the table across from us.  Tomorrow is her birthday, and she’ll get a stuffed bear that she’ll become inseparable from.  It’s hard not to smile as I realize how happy she’ll be.  Whatever brief happiness I feel for the little girl disappears as I turn my attention back to my wife. 

“I may be late getting home tonight,” she says, taking a sip of water nervously, “So much extra work.”

I can see her future.  I know that when she leaves this diner, when she walks down the block and takes an inattentive step into the road, she’ll be run down by a young driver.  That stupid bag of hers will skitter across the road with a spray of blood on it; the driver screaming in shock at the sight of the body that has shattered his windshield.  At this moment, I can’t bring myself to even attempt to alter my wife’s unfortunate destiny, the pain of her betrayal is so great.

There are twisty twined trees, there are weeds and neglect,

As you walk the park paths, you’ll hear a faint echo –

Footfalls – your own? – in that dim and grim ghetto,

Coming closer and closer as if someone’s there...

You whirl and see no one, just fog on the air.

So you whistle – it whistles. You cough – and it coughs.

Then from murky mists a gray shadow breaks off.

It’s your height and your size and your very same shape,

And then it’s upon you, no time to escape!

You suck in cold air, and then – *poof* – it moves through you.

You laugh at yourself – a shadow can’t chew you!

But you turn and see someone who’s walking away,

This person – your double! – you glimpse with dismay.

They continue their strolling on down the park trail,

While you melt into mist, a fog of gray veil.

To the townsfolk, at the end it will not matter. All that will matter is that she pay equal penance for the fate she bestowed upon her little girl and their Labrador. For the townsfolk, it was important that she be the final lesson to parents who leave angels to rot in the sun as they shop at their local Wal-Mart.

Or just tap on the long walls, closing in and then stopping a few feets away from them. Few times I even recited some latin phrases from a distance.

Yeah, they see me sometimes, but I learned to hide quickly, so they think it's just their eyes playing tricks on them. Anyway, it is fun seeing them packing and leaving in a rush, sometimes running to their cars, sometimes really scared, shouting about demons and stuff.

Usually when I went out, it was during the day. Everything was so beautiful. I loved watching all the flora and fauna comfortably under the sunlight. I wouldn't say I was bored of it exactly, but I did want to branch out a little. I decided to take a trip in the middle of the night. I only brought along a single head lamp which, in hindsight, was a terrible idea. I drove out to my usual spot and disembarked. It was a little more difficult to see than I had expected, but I was already here so I decided not to worry about it. 

At night, it was a whole different experience. My head lamp shimmered off of various reflective surfaces, giving the place an eerie blue glow. The animals here were different than during the day. Occasionally I would catch a glimpse of something I had never seen before. I was so absorbed that I lost track of time; over an hour had already passed. My head lamp had been growing dimmer, and it got to the point that I could barely see my outstretched hands. Just as I decided it was time to head back, something grabbed my foot.

It began dragging me far away. Farther than I had ever ventured before. Struggling against what ever it was yielded no result. It was strong, and it would not let go. The further it took me away from my vehicle, the colder I got. Then I herd a loud rumble, and a massive rock slide came down on my legs. It either killed the thing holding onto me, or it scared it off, but I was still trapped. The rocks were much too heavy to lift. As my head lamp finally ran out of battery and I became engulfed in complete darkness and silence, I began wondering which would come first. Would I get eaten by some unseen horror, or would my scuba tank run out of oxygen?

The following was, too. “Bring her down.” A voicemail left at dinner time.
The steps of the basement creaked as I carried the unconscious woman down into the dark. 
“Leave us”, an inhuman growl from the corner.

The reaction was inevitable, really.

You throw in a country ruled by a dictator on the verge of long-range nuclear weapons, and a country slowly leaking the glory it had built up in the second world war through holes of bankruptcy and corruption?

The results aren't great.

Of course, there was bargaining. But no-one in the government really took it seriously.

It was the worst example of communism and the worst example of capitalism. They're not exactly birds of a feather. One had to go, and both of them knew it.

That's why the U.S. launched the bomb.

It was a game of wastelands, Russian roulette with the world. Neither side could afford to make any mistakes. 

You can almost understand the physicist's dilemma. They had to create a bomb powerful enough that there was zero possibility of a counter attack, zero possibility of a nuclear winter over the Northern Hemisphere.

That's how they created it. If you can't destroy something with pure explosive force, how could you destroy it instantly otherwise? A bomb that blew open a hole in matter, an unstable black hole.

Of course there was testing. You still can't go anywhere near Area 43.

The delivery was simple. A passing plane simply dropped it on a more rural part of Korea. We lost the plane, half of South Korea, and most of the surrounding ocean. But not because the hole in space absorbed it all.

""I recently attended what could only be described as a wake-in-waiting for an elderly gent with whom I have had a passing acquaintance for some years now. I was invited to his summer estate by telegram, under pretense that a number of people in his circle of friends were to come and enjoy a week-long retreat of bonfires, boating and good cheer. Instead, we were treated to the horror of an old man in the last stages of a wasting disease: a hollow-eyed, skeletal madman, ranting that his young wife was, in fact, the familiar of a demon to which he had sold his soul many years before. We were there, he informed us, to make sure that she didn't perpetrate any violence to his person, with the intent of speeding his death.

""His pretty young wife was Asiatic in appearance and could speak not a single word of English. She gazed sorrowfully down from her husband's bedside the whole five days that it took for him to die. The old man begged his guests to take turns at a twenty-four-hour watch, and, not knowing what else to do, we obliged him. It was during my watch when he began to rattle his last few breaths, and I called to the others to rouse themselves from sleep and join me. Our host's eyes were wild with fear; he clawed feebly at the doctor's sleeves as he died, clutching at them, as if to hold on and not be dragged away ... unmoving, his wife watched it all. We all bowed our heads in silence to his demise - except for a maid, who was present in the room and blind since birth. The maid stared with milky eyes at the new widow beside the bed and began to scream, *""She's eating him! She's eating him! Dear God, she's eating him!'""*",,False,,t5_2t6kz,False,,,True,t3_18sys2,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/18sys2/a_wakeinwaiting/,

Above them, it wasn't long before tortured screams had started to echo on the streets, as their neighbors were systematically hunted, torn to ropes of tissue and re-assembled; they lived anew as homicidal piles of raw, glistening meat and sharpened bone. To drown out this horrific cacophony, the man and his wife clung to each other on the cot and made quiet, desperate love, again and again ... they did so to re-affirm their bond, their lives, their very existence. They did it in defiance of their eventual demise; to be stuck in a frozen moment of heaven, while Hell was unleashed above.

Like a young man smitten, the husband rediscovered his wife's form with grasping hands and sucking mouth, and she writhed beneath his frenzy. She took her man inside her in every way that she'd ever denied him before. They fucked and gyrated and strained against each other in rivers of sweat; in the real world, human civilization toppled and died. Days melded into nights - fires raged above, and lust reigned below. They fucked; they ate; they slept. They lost themselves in a sweet dream of friction and heat.

The man and his wife were startled awake by the sound of a hole being drilled into the living room wall above them. The swarming abominations had finally been alerted to their presence, and the dream was over. The man kissed the upper swell of his wife's left breast, tenderly, then pressed the barrel of the pistol there and pulled the trigger.

She wanted to watch these silly horror movies though, so I threw one in the DVD player and we started watching it. 

It was this story of a young girl being chased through her home every night. But each morning, the stalker was gone. I think she started to get a bit scared because she had started to grow cold, but we pressed on. Eventually, the stalker started following her with a long kitchen knife. Finally, the climax of the film arrived and in all its gory details showed the stalker killing the young girl. The blood dripping off of the knife into his mouth, the entrails diced up in her abdomen…I had to admit, it brought back some good memories.

Good thing I work in a hospital.  For months, I’d collected my offerings.  A few “misplaced” blood samples here, some pre-op hair clippings there.

probably tops the rest. I am now among a tribe of cannibals on some remote unnamed island in the pacific, trying
 to understand their culture and customs. Apart from almost being made directly into a meal the second I arrived,
 the indigenous people are very welcoming and friendly, so long as I take part in their rituals and traditions. I've 
gone through most of their initiation trials already: walking over hot coals, hunting and killing a wild boar, smoking
 the local herbs, things like that. But now it is time to eat. I see them bring foreword a heavy-set man bound in 
rope. They then proceed to slit his throat and kill him, right in front of the entire tribe. I now understand what is 
going on, I'm just glad it's this poor man and not me. After skinning him, dismembering his limbs, and gutting his 
organs, they throw hunks of his flesh into a pot, to prepare a stew of some sort. They pour bowls and offer one 
to me. I kindly decline, but they make it obvious that if I don't comply, I'll be the next one in that pot. So against
 all decency and sense humanity, I begin to sip from the bowl. There was something about it, in the taste and 
the texture, there was something, I just couldn't figure out what-And then it hit me. An entire childhood of 
innocent memories rushed over me, now tainted by the sudden realization. I nearly broke down entirely right 
there in front of the tribe, but I held my composure because, I really have to hand it to these cannibals, it tastes

Dad said taking the train would be fun and we'd have more time to bond as a family, but it's not happening. Mom and Dad got into an argument pretty early on and have sat quietly, separately fuming. I tried to get Dad to play a card game with me, but he said no, and told me to look out the window at the ""beautiful mountains"" so clearly he's still in a mood. I heard the people sitting behind us talking about the tunnel up ahead and that it's one of the longest tunnels in the nation and comes out over a majestic lake valley.

I imagined how dark it would be in there, and turned around to them, smiling, and said, ""What if it's haunted?"" They chuckled and we started telling silly scary stories about zombies or vampires who live in the tunnel. When the train entered the tunnel, it got really dark and we kept sharing ideas. ""What if,"" one of them said, ""when we come out, we find there's a monster who got on the train?"" Or ""What if, when we come out, you're suddenly ghosts!"" I said. When the light at the end of the tunnel started getting brighter, we knew our game would be ending soon so we rushed and we came up with more and more scary ""What ifs,"" trying to outdo each other before the tunnel's darkness ran out. ""What if,"" I said, ""your eyes started to glow right now because you're really aliens!?"" They laughed at that one.

When we exited the tunnel, the train lurched and that's when I started screaming, and then we all did. We were so focused on the imaginary horrors we'd been making up, none of us had considered a possible reality. None of us had said, ""What if the bridge is out?""

That this candle here is for dear Mister Bode

Let this candle’s shine be for Madam Von Rose,

Whose eyeballs did sparkle so fine as they froze!

And this candle smokes like old John Bailey Hughes

Who sizzled and shrieked as he went up my flue.

And this one’s for Nathan, while this one’s for Ned –

The twins who, I found, could not exchange heads.

This next-to-last candle’s for Sally Celeste,

Whom one horse took East, as one took her West.

It was suicide. He'd had drug problems in the past, and struggled with depression, but none of knew how bad it had gotten. No one saw the warning signs. Maybe we would have suspected something if we'd seen his art...
 
His computer was full of digital photographs; shots he'd taken of the old hospital, the woods around town, his house. They weren't great, as far as landscapes go. But then he'd taken them and photoshopped in these... creatures. They looked something like satyrs and minotaurs, but corrupt. Some were covered with infected sores running with puss; some were emaciated, with broken horns and dessicated skin. Some had insectoid or arachnid features, like compound eyes, and exoskeletons; many had such traits in combination. They're drawn in a style reminiscent of Brom, but the realism of the images rivals anything Giger's ever done with an airbrush. They show how much talent and potential Jeremy had; they also show how dark a place he was in. I miss the guy, and I prayed for him.

A week ago, his brother sent me a box of Jeremy's possessions that they'd found clearing out his storage unit. Inside was an envelope of some of his old work, pictures of the same creatures lurking around town.

The most effective jokes are those that set up an expectation and then defeat it. Take the following example:

Two goldfish are in a tank. One says to the other, “How do you drive this thing anyway?”

The joke is humorous because you assume from the first sentence that the story takes place in a goldfish tank. The second sentence upsets this belief and prompts you to laugh at yourself. The essence of horror is also the reversal of expectations. In horror, the puppet manipulates its master, the inanimate object becomes animated, and your reflection keeps smiling even after you begin to scream. Horror shakes your most basic assumptions about how the world works. If properly executed, it can make you fear the most commonplace things, even things you used to love.

Here’s an example that you might relate to better: Say you rush to turn off the Sinatra song that used to be your favorite, only to find your radio has been unplugged the entire time.

Say you hear footsteps and whistling in the front hall, and you smile before remembering you live alone now.

Say you lock the door to your study and stuff rags in the crack to keep out the penetrating cold, but the door still swings open of its own accord.

There, my fellow lumbermen told me this story about the boss man’s daughter.

She was a beautiful girl with one quirk, which was her love for things most folks consider unsightly – dead roses, rotting trees, old bones and such. Her father had declared her off-limits to his workmen, so she took comfort instead from all things sad and lonely, like herself. Now, in those northern woods there lives a creature of legend with a funny name: the squonk. Some say squonks are animals, some say they are part human, but all agree they’re the ugliest beasts that ever lived. So ugly, they weep all the time! Although monstrous, none have ever been captured, for once seen squonks will dissolve completely in a sudden gush of shame-filled tears.

Well, this girl fell in love with one. Every night she’d slip out to the dark forest, where the pair would listen to each other's sorrows. United by sadness, they made plans to wed and run away, but the squonk had one proviso – that she should never look directly upon him. She reluctantly agreed, and their secret wedding night arrived. Atop a high hill beneath the moon, she closed her eyes and lay back as the squonk took her into his hideous arms and kissed her, deeply and passionately. Come morning, however, the poor girl’s lifeless body was found in that same spot. Her story was sifted from her diary, but her death took some deduction. Eventually it was decided she had yielded to temptation and tried to sneak a look at her lover during their first and only kiss. Perhaps she screamed at the sight of him, perhaps not.

Either way, a high hill was a very strange place to drown.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,False,,,True,t3_1eaopg,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1eaopg/the_sad_tale_of_the_squonks_wedding/,

In a way, I feared darkness because it brought out the irrational fears within me. My father used to tell me not to worry. He said that there was nothing to fear for “people like us” and that I would understand once I grew up. And as I grew up, my fears did disappear.

I live a happy life now, with a wife and a nine year old son. Recently, my son told me that he was afraid of the man hiding in the empty closet. He sure reminds me of myself when I was younger. “There’s nothing to fear for people like us, son”, I assured him as I opened his closet door. Surely enough, there was nothing but darkness behind those closed doors. My son reluctantly climbed onto his bed and slept.

It was during one of these long, dark nights that a great storm came rolling in from the north. I was hoping I could just chill inside, but the light kept going out for some unknown reason, so I spent the night running back and forth between the house and the lighthouse. After getting a few hours of restless sleep, I woke up in the afternoon to find that the storm had died down.

 Looking out my window, I saw to my great surprise that I had a visitor. A man in a grey overall was standing at the beach, seemingly unfazed by the northern wind blowing in behind him. In fact, he was completely motionless, looking up towards the house. I was about to go greet him, when by blind luck I remembered my kettle of water on the stove. Turning it off, I happened to glance out the kitchen window. Another man had joined the first one, this one wearing a blue overall. He looked like a ship engineer. They both stood silent, slack jawed, staring. The waves washing over their feet didn't seem to bother them. No boat was on the beach. I looked closer. It wasn't before now I noticed their soaked garments, their shriveled hands, their blue, bloated faces. Another head broke the waves.

""So, which little tyke are you in charge of?"" he said with a smile.

In an instant he was up, and walking toward the playground, and walked over to little Michael and said something to him.

As he was walking past me on his way out with his boy, something seemed off.  He speaking very softly, almost whispering to the young boy.  He was pointing at his car, and saying something about getting ice cream.  As they were passing, I waved to them and was about to say goodbye, when I realized the man never gave me his name.

I live to be there for others, even to my own detriment.  The best part about my gift, because I truly would call it a gift, is that I can see the good, the purpose, in everyone.  Even in those who might not see it in themselves.  

My most recent example was a homeless man I saw sitting at the street corner, a worn cardboard sign in his hands, begging for food.  This was about four months ago.  I, being the wonderful human being that I am, drove home and cooked this man a delicious meal with what meat I hadn’t donated to the local food bank.  When I brought it to him, he was ever so grateful, and we struck up a fast friendship.  Weeks went by, as I brought him more food, gave him money, gave him new clothes; even helped him apply for a job.  I worked so hard to put him in a better place, to allow him to contribute to humanity, that it was quite distressing to see him still sitting on that street corner in tattered clothes with that same worn sign after four months.  

Tonight, I invited him back to my home, determined to give him another chance.  I can still see the purpose in him, despite his best efforts to fail.  Everyone has a purpose, and his is just as clear as the last misguided soul I’d tried to help.  As he lies there dead on the floor, some of his blood still dripping from the metal pipe in my hand, I think of all the poor families that he will be able to feed.

*I’m right here,* I could say. *Just a few seconds away from your room.* But that didn’t work the last two times. If anything, it made him more afraid. With a sigh, a mumble “I promise you have nothing to be scared of,”

My son frowned. “I’m not scared for me. The Nightmare Man said that I didn’t need to be afraid of him. He talks about you a lot, though.”

At first, the world was elated; science had finally done something right again. 


But AVG was a little too good at its job. As the bacterium accidentally, and yet inevitably, spread out from plastic reduction centers to the outside world, it quickly became known as the “new rust.” Plastic toys purchased for Christmas would have quarter-sized holes in them before Easter. Car interiors were reduced to dust in months. Medical instruments, computers, toothbrushes, cell-phones, buttons, shopping bags, you name it, it was all dissolving into what looked like gray powder. The irony was people were now consuming at an even more furious rate than before, because what you bought last week would be unusable in three weeks. Glass, wood and various metals rebounded as production materials, but it turns out that it is really hard to substitute for everything plastic did. Hospitals, transportation, the internet, everything started to crash. Something had to be done. That’s why they made AVG-231, a mutation designed to reprogram 230 into something inert or at least slower acting. 


I just read today’s newspaper. Turns out AVG is now eating human flesh at an even faster rate than it ever ate plastic. For a second I thought I should try to find bio-hazard suits for my family, but those things were made of plastic too.

Sure, everyone has to make choices when they wake up. Things like “what to wear?” or “do I have a bagel or fruit for breakfast.” My choice is a little different. Being a father and a husband, I must choose who I want to be with. Every morning I wake up I roll over to find I am sleeping alone. My wife always was an early riser.  So when I leave the bedroom into the hallway I have to decide to either take a peek in my beautiful daughter’s room or go straight to the kitchen for a cup of my wife’s favorite morning brew. We Catholics can always find a path to guilt. 

For me, it is always an impossible choice to make. I want to be with them both constantly, together, but to choose one means I must neglect the other. It kills me inside because I love and need them both for me to breathe, nevertheless function. But every morning I make the choice to open my angel’s bedroom and look in the toddler bed she slept peacefully in. I take in the sight of her toys on the floor still spread out from the most recent time she played with them. There are fewer pleasures greater than watching your little one create imaginary worlds in front of you and welcome you into it by handing you a plastic fork turned thermometer turned airplane. 

When I’m done my quiet morning daydream, I enter the kitchen that my wife insisted I remodel. There, I brew myself a cup and stare at the new backsplash and sink my wife once picked out that I had recently installed. I only wish she had seen it before she left me alone. But then I never would have changed the stained wallpaper or the saturated sink she rested against when I last saw her had she not made her choice to go. I could never be upset with her for leaving me. She too had an impossible choice; to live with the sorrow of missing our perfect little angel or to attempt to join her in eternity as soon as she could. At least she could make that choice. We Catholics cannot.

I didn’t buy this machine so I could sit at the playground and watch the sunlight streak highlights into the rich, deep timber colored hair of my former childhood self. Nor did I buy it to revisit the days when my smile, as white as snow, would sparkle and dance alongside my bright green eyes every time I ran into my fathers arms. I don’t want to meet myself and show my childhood the upcoming yellow stained teeth, the dirt caked under my fat rolls, the balding head, the spurts of pink lesions caking my body. I only bought this machine to see my father again. The loving, caring, cradling father that held me so close when the night was darkest. The father that would toss me in the air, then catch me just before my feeble body collided with the hard, concrete floor. The father that would have protected me from what I’ve now become. I remember very little of the time I spent with my him, but I remember that he was the only one who ever cared, the only person in whose arms I was fully secure, whose embrace always calmed my chattering teeth and quivering toes.  It pained me deeply when he disappeared. I remember waking one dark night to the sound of thuds, grunts, and piercing screams. There was a struggle, a clutter and clang of toppling furniture, a vicious and horrifying shriek. My small hands draped the blanket over my tiny body and I called out my fathers name as loud as my frail vocal chords allowed. He did not respond. He was gone. I never heard from him again.

That’s all I want to see. I just want to know what happened that night. Tonight. That’s why I’m here, hiding in the closet, watching that child dream. I won’t make myself known. If I need to, I can always press the panic button and be hurled back to my present time. My obese, faltering body is making it difficult to sit here without stirring, but I won't make a sound. I can see the blanket rise and recede in rhythmic breathing. I can hear my father’s footsteps right outside the door. He slowly opens and strolls in. There he is, standing tall, just as handsome as I remember. A white sleeveless tank top tightly hugs his body, he walks with the confidence that always assured me that he was in control, that he would protect me. I’m nervous. My atrophied muscles are tensing and sweat droplets are collecting on my upper lip. This is when it happened. This is when it will occur, and the small child will wake up and fasten a tight grip onto the blanket, screaming my father’s name directly into the darkness.

My father is approaching my former self now. He is whispering something into my ear as he gently tousles my hair. So much love he had for me. My eyes are watering.

I'm blind.

When I fell asleep yesterday my eyes worked perfectly but now I can't see a thing. I managed to go downstairs and turned the radio on. This hasn't just occurred to me. It seemed like the whole world has lost its eyesight at the same time. Many accidents have happened. As the newscaster reported that scientists were trying to find a cure I called family and friends to see if they were hurt. Everyone was all right. Nevertheless I prepared the house so I'm able to find all important things easily. It was an exhausting day. My head hurts and I'll go to bed now. This is only temporary.

*May 3*

I'm deaf.

Deaf, blind and scared. I stayed in bed the whole day. What else should I do? I don't know if It's just me, but how should I know? However, if nobody can hear anymore it's unlikely that anyone is still looking for a solution... this probably isn't temporary, is it? But worse than asking if I will ever be able to see and hear again is another question:

His son was clutching his flashlight tightly to his chest, but he peeled off one hand and pointed straight down. ""Under the bed,"" he said in a tiny whisper. Dustin's blue eyes were huge, lit up by the flashlight with pupils the size of pinheads. He was terrified. *Don't get mad, don't get mad, don't get mad,* Daddy thought to himself. He sighed.

Daddy didn't want to coddle the boy, but he did want to go back to bed sometime in the near future.

The bunny rabbit blanket was large; it draped over all sides, cutting off the light. But there *was* something there. Something shadowy. He reached out his arm and felt dampness. *What the hell?* If the boy had spilled something on the hardwood floors... And it was sticky, too. Wonderful. His hand traveled further, and he touched softness. Cloth. Flannel. He just managed to pinch it with his straining fingers, and pulled. Something heavier moved with it as he tugged it closer.

""Hand me your light,"" he said, crooking his other arm to reach back up for the flashlight. As he took it, he fumbled it awkwardly, dropping it to the floor beside his face. Jerking away from the impact, he barked out in pain as he suddenly wrenched his back. *""Son of a bitch!,""* he somehow managed not to scream. Panting, with tears in his eyes, he knew he was going to need help getting back up. That's when he noticed the flashlight. It had rolled beneath the bed. He saw something glassy and shiny there; two eyes were staring back at him, wide as saucers. Even in the glare from the flashlight, they didn't blink. They were very blue eyes. And very familiar.

This horrible, gnawing pain, clawing at your innards. Your brain alive with a constant cacophony, as if swarming with thousands of incessant hornets, driving you further to madness. Despite this, despite the deep, unceasing throbs wracking your body with blinding pain, you cannot stop. Your body will not let you.

She is quiet now, only the faint gurgles of her last, fleeting breath struggling through the blood that fills her throat, as she feebly grasps at the red, slippery, mess that is the strewn remnants of her organs, spread across her lap.

I laid in bed and listened to the padding of her slippered feet as she crossed the hall into my son's nursery. ""You forgot to turn the heat up again. It's freezing in here!"" she barked at me. I squeezed my eyes tightly together. Was I really supposed to put up with this?

I heard a melodic tinkling as she started the mobile that hung over my son's crib, then the soft click of the rocking chair. I was just drifting back to sleep when I felt her ease into the bed next to me. ""It took him forever to fall back asleep. It's your turn next time."" I nodded in agreement, then leaned over to give her a kiss. She turned away before my lips could make contact.

Robert Blackburn had been a nice man who would turn his large house into a timeshare during the summer months while he went traveling.

In an ancient cupboard, they even found a stack of moldy cards which asked guests to rate their stay, and they dutifully filled them in: “13 out of 10 stars! Enjoyed not being murdered!” Daring each other, they slept in Blackburn’s dank, earthy basement beneath the rotting floorboards, where the killer had hidden himself so often.

We hit the ground going 16 KM/Min, suppression field activating on touchdown. The Roedians are waiting for us, but we outnumber them two to one. I'm told to take the high position, through the cliffs, we're gonna flank them right into the main squad. I've got a Roedian right in my sights, finger on the trigger waiting for the kill order, but a sound from somewhere behind me is drowning out communications. Then the Roedians stop firing and turn around.

Behind me is a creature towering at least a kilometer high. It's thousand mouths let out a mourning song that crushes my soul. On long bent legs it walks towards us, blotting out the twin suns, each step is an earthquake. I hear screaming from behind me, the creature bends down and looks at me with one large eye. Its infinite gaze pierces me, and in its gaze I know I will never be as compassionate and understanding as it, and I weep into my stupid tiny hands.

Every morning, before anyone in the house stirred, He was awakened by the soft glow of light peeking through the window, accompanied by chirpings and rustlings of birds and squirrels. For ten minutes or so, He would look between the curtains and observe the life that played across the stage. The people all played the same parts every morning, going about their routines and movements across the street without so much as a glance towards His window, but He didn’t mind - they were the only part of the day that made Him feel like He was still a moving part of the world. 

It was after ten minutes or so that His caretaker, Laurie, would come in, making her asinine morning greetings in her nasally voice, and proceed to put Him in the lift, so that she could begin His day. He hated being a C-4. Before the accident, He had never even let His own wife wash His underwear. Now, He had some assigned idiot wiping His ass for Him, feeding Him, and turning Him at night, to ensure that His flesh wouldn’t rot out from under Him. The only movement He had left was in His eyes, His neck, and His face. He couldn’t even breathe on His own – His Autovent 4000 took care of that for Him. 

So, it was on a morning of no particular significance that a weak light tickled His face, and He opened His eyes, turned His neck, and looked out the window to a strange world. It was utterly silent – no chirping, no rustling. No footsteps or bike chains. He blinked, and strained to listen. Nothing. Then, He realized that the whole of His world was still. Mr. Dawson and Gale the Beagle were not starting their walk, Mrs. Lawson had not shuffled out of her house to get the newspaper, and the newspaper boy was not shooting down the street. Outside, the world was absolutely immobile. He looked out, furrowing His eyebrows, thinking that He was missing something. Nothing. He looked for the requisite 10 minutes or so, and then turned His head towards the door. He waited. Nothing. Laurie never barged through the door. The house, and indeed the world, lay silent and still. As the hours dragged on, and the only movement was of the sun in the sky, the only sound being the Autovent 4000, He knew that He was completely and utterly alone. For the first time, He was acutely aware of His heartbeat, and this sound filled Him with an unspeakable terror.

I kept her in the basement, having her practice the violin for six hours a day. She started when she was five. That was 15 years ago.

Then I realized, no one knew I had a daughter and if they asked her, she may just sing. So, I kept her there in the basement where she was safe and could perfect her act. She would listen to old orchestral movements, study lines of music theory, practice until her fingers would bleed and the bow would snap. She was my little muse; I would have her play as I practiced my ballet steps from when I was her age.

I will never forget the first time she saw the light of day. I was drinking a morning cup of coffee at the kitchen table when I noticed the basement door was ajar. I spilled the coffee all over my lap and bolted for the front door, knocking over my chair and a bookcase in the process.

Summary of Findings:

Doctor Joseph Rankle was a top neurosurgeon who had his license revoked for unethical practices. Patient files suggest sadism, though that was only the beginning. He was subsequently hired by an unknown international organization that specialized in information extraction through torture. Dr. Rankle had successfully performed head transplants on humans in secret trials, the procedures of which are fully documented in his private notes. Standard information extraction procedures (SIEP) as developed by Dr. Rankle involved full torture of the victim’s body excluding the head of the victim. Upon exhaustion, Dr. Rankle would then transplant the victim’s head onto a living and healthy body, successfully attaching all nerves and muscle function to the point of the victim regaining full mobility and sensation. Torture was resumed until either the desired information was acquired or the new body was exhausted. If the latter, SIEP would then dictate a second healthy body for transplant and so on. In over one hundred and ten SIEP victims, private files show a one hundred percent success rate in obtaining information with no victim holding out for more than four transplants. 

Recommendations:

The innovative SIEP reliably secures any and all desired information from human subjects. As such, this procedure and along with it Dr. Joseph Rankle, should be considered a highly prized asset for the government and its defense. This panel recommends Dr. Joseph Rankle be given a new identity, full access to top secret government funded laboratories to operate, and a position to train other approved neurosurgeons on SIEP.",,False,,t5_2t6kz,1349117436.0,,,True,t3_10ruik,http://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/10ruik/summary/,

I used to go on there pretty much every night, when it was late, just to scare myself watching black-and-white Russian videos and contemplating gory photoshopped pictures. And, of course, declaring to the other users that their videos weren't scary and that I could photoshop gore better than them without touching a computer. It was a bit strange, in hindsight, that the website let you share files for download but not post links.

The last video I watched, was different from the others. I downloaded it onto my desktop, and started watching - the video struck me as unique immediately. Crystal clear, it showed a little girl in a white dress sitting on a stool and bent in concentration over a piano. The video was shot from behind her, and had no sound, but it was clear that she was practising something, repeating the same pattern over and over again. All of a sudden, the girl's body tensed, and she made as if to turn around. Not wanting another jump scare, I closed the media player and went to sleep.

Since then, my mind keeps returning to what I saw, going through it over and over again. My computer, when I turned it on the following morning, was stuck on the media player, with the girl bent over the piano. For some reason, not seeing the girl's face is making me more and more tense each day - as is the thought that she is always there, playing that sequence of notes, over and over, waiting. I don't go into my bedroom anymore, and when I do, I give my back to the monitor. I'm afraid that if I turn around, she will too.

Of course, my brother and sister both keep me happy with their constant games and affection. I just wish I could give all that joy back to each of them like the good ole days.

At least they are with me now. Everyone is pretty quiet though and I do not know where we are going but at least we are taking a car ride. I used to love these rides…ugh, the pain...it never goes away anymore. It doesn't matter what my parents feed me, nothing makes me feel any better.  They just cuddle and coddle me now. I love it when they do, it brings me as much comfort as I can find these days. And now I see why everyone is so quiet, we are back at the doc’s office…or at least that’s what my big sister calls it. Not too fond of this place, ever since I was a small thing I can remember dreading this place. That feeling hasn’t changed either, not in my 14 years and it probably never will. At least my siblings and Mom are hugging me tight, even through the pain I still find joy in it. I kiss each of them, thanking them, while catching the salty water on their face as they pull me close. 

It’s just me, Dad and Doc now in this dark and dreary room. Mom said she couldn’t come in so Dad is standing in front of me while I lay belly to table. His face is so close to me, staring me in my eyes and brushing back my hair. I know he loves me with everything in his heart and I know he knows I love him more. Not even a small bite on my back can keep me from relishing this loving moment with my Dad. Wish we can sit like this forever but I am getting too sleepy to keep eye contact. That car ride must have worn me out. Thankfully, Dad is still close but he looks to be in great pain too. I’ll give him one more loving lick, a thanks, to make him feel better before I rest.

It's dark down here, but I can see the spiders and rats that I hunt just fine. I don't need light to see. I don't need it to live, not like you do. Do you miss me still? Do you wonder about what became of me anymore?

I smile instead. Because I love you, and I always will. Every night, when my eyes spring open and I realize, once again, that my dreams of you were nothing but lies that loneliness told me - every night I'm glad that the bastard took me, and not you. I was trailing behind you at the fair when it snatched me. You never even suspected what really happened ... and I'm so fucking glad that you didn't, because it could have easily been you that got carried off that night, so many years ago.

High school sweethearts who got knocked up. You know the type. We had dreams that were larger than we were, aspirations larger than mountains and virtually nothing to show for it. It wasn’t a romantic life you’d read about in books.

 

I spent that week planning our vacation, where we would go and what we’d do. We had talked too often about everywhere we should go. I wanted this to be the vacation of a lifetime, because I knew it wasn’t something we could ever do again. I settled on Paris, we could see the Eiffel Tower and sky dive, walk the streets and pretend like we were still young. It took me a year to save up enough money to afford the ticket.

 

We walked the streets, my hands around her. We dined at all the places we had wanted to and I reminisced about the day we met, graduated and when Abby was born. She never liked to talk about Abby, because that meant remembering how Abby died. This vacation was about life and I was sorry I brought it up but it was time to let go. We let go as we walked to the tower, and let go on the elevator ride up. We let go as we gazed out across Paris. We let go of everything. “We’re doing it, Sara. We’re falling through the sky.” I said in the few fleeting moments of our free fall before they were interrupted by the sound of a canister of ashes hitting the pavement.

It's not like they told us what it was called. They didn't tell us anything.

Naturally, we thought they were here to steal our water so we replied with everything we had. Armor penetrating shells, missiles and finally tactical nuclear warheads.

All protected by the same shields as the Mothership, none of them interacting with us whether we fired upon them or attempted communication. For the most part, they stuck to their respective kind, not doing much at all. No abducted livestock, no crop circles, no nothing.

Then, after a few weeks, they left. Sure, the oceans were a couple of feet lower but other than that it was like they never had been here at all.

Today, unfortunately, I’ve got my backpack on. When I’m wearing my backpack, I usually have to favour the Slanty-Ballerina; on tip toes, arms up, tiny diagonal steps until I’m clear of the bike. See, the problem with the slanty-ballerina is that you never quite know when you’re clear of the bike. Drop to flat-foot too soon and you’ll find a trailing strap has wrapped around the handle of the bike and you’ll find yourself dragged backwards into a clanging mess of tyre and spoke. 


That’s why, for those aching few feet, I’m always on edge. Wondering if I’m going to feel that terrible pull from behind which means that I was too soon, too presumptuous and I wasn’t safe. Still, I suppose, it’s not really the bike’s fault. Not this time. It couldn’t have been the bike.

When he reached 150 steps, the exact number of steps he had taken while going down, he was shocked to realize that the entrance was nowhere in sight, there was only darkness ahead of him.

He frantically ran up the stairs for minutes but couldn't see the entrance. His flashlight suddenly stopped working, leaving him in complete darkness. It wasn't possible, he thought to himself, maybe he had counted the steps incorrectly. After running up the stairs for ten minutes, he finally started to believe all the stories he had heard.

Don't get me wrong, I love seeing him like this. 

But you see, I remember that day on the overpass. I remember the rain, the thunder, and I remember how *angry*. I was at him. I remember everything in shades of gray, the gunmetal clouds, the slate road, and his sick, gray face. I remember yelling at him to get the fuck out, that I was sick of being his friend if he was just going to keep fucking up like this. I remember being angry enough to follow him out and start pushing him. I remember him kneeling in the swirling rainwater and crying, and I remember punching his stupid fucking face, to get that fucking look off of it. I remember him standing up and punching back and suddenly I wanted to hurt him. I remember dragging him over to the edge. I've always been stronger than him, ever since we were kids. I remember, I *clearly* remember, pushing him against the railing, making him look me in the face. I remember the railing giving way. I swear I don't remember doing that on purpose, but I do remember him toppling over, suddenly overbalancing me. I remember that I had to let him go, or the both of us would have gone over. I remember what he sounded like hitting the bottom, like a sack of flour dropped on the steps. 

I remember the scabrous, mottled body that crept from the side of the highway. It crouched over his body. Its tongue came out and licked the blood coming from the corner of his mouth, cartoonishly long. Its whole body was wrong. Its head was too big, its legs too small, its arms far, far too long. It dragged his body to the side of the road, and it ripped into him like an overripe fruit, the juice of his blood the only bright color on its gray, sore-covered body. It looked up at me and made eye contact. It grinned, shredded meat stuck between its sharp teeth. 

And here he is again. I think I'm glad he's okay. If he's still in there. But I don't think that's the case. I think the thing from under the overpass is wearing him like a suit. I think that I'm in trouble, because I know what's behind the mask. And because I think it followed me home tonight. I think it knows I'm alone.

I think I hear it downstairs.

It concerns a young man that I once knew, a strange fellow who was obsessed with discovering the secret of *vita aeterna*, life eternal. He was the nephew of my father's accountant, and he frequented the same social circles as I.

I'd heard that he'd taken a sabbatical to the far East, in pursuit of his morbid fascination. A year or two later, I saw him at a dinner party, an event that was organized in honor of a certain political figure at the time. He took me aside when the opportunity arose and informed me, his eye twitching, that he had divined the secret while deep in the heart of Indo-China. ""When someone dies ... and if your mind is open ... you can see their soul departing,"" he told me, then smiled. It was a ghastly grin, one that spoke of things which are best left unspoken. ""If you can *see* it,"" he continued, ""then you can *catch* it.""

Soon after, he was accused of the grisly murder of a prostitute, and his father helped him flee the country to avoid prosecution. That dinner party was the last I saw of the man - until a few days ago, that is. I was checking out of a hotel in New York when, through the glass of the lobby doors, I noticed a shabby-looking gent who was furtively negotiating with an attractive young prostitute. I am old, and my eyes aren't what they used to be ... but it was *him*, I am sure of it. He must have felt my gaze, and when he registered who I was, he quickly turned and outright fled from the scene. What troubles me most is this: I last saw him forty-seven years ago.

It was 1967 and the strong taste, the taste and the flavor, filled him even now.  He recalled pouring the remnant boiled water onto the child he lured there. The screams were equally as potent.  They dug the boy up in 1992, I believe.

Right after that he left home.  Taking his father's keys to his Ford, leaving his parents buried together and the dogs left on the porch to mold and rot.  Those were his formative years.  Taking in hitchhikers.  Boiling their fingers in his tea.  He could taste the nigh imperceptible nodes of blood, which added quite positively to the flavor.  He wondered if they were all found.  He might one morning, reading his newspaper and drinking his tea, catch a story about half a dozen bodies being disinterred from improvised graves off dirt roads and wonder.

His last one — last, he though, so terminal! — was in the fall of 1989 in Las Vegas, Nevada.  He became careless by allowed this male prostitute to escape.  He could squeal, he could end everything.

Feeling the first drops of rain hit my skin.

Watching the lightning hit seemingly random locations.

Staying outside during the thunderstorm instead of cowering inside.

The tranquility of the calm before the storm, the rush of peace during the downpour.

Happiness isn’t smiling, it’s not laughing, or even feeling joy.

True happiness is the feeling of peace that can only be achieved alone.

The time when you can let go of yourself, let go of reality.

The time to not be yourself, but to *become* yourself.

For that small moment, you can reach *equilibrium*.

The balance between good and bad, between memories and imagination.

Between reality and fiction.

The time not to be you, but to be *yourself*.

The time to just let go, move on and drop their bodies in the lake.

He wondered how long it had been since he had seen another car. 

*At least 100 miles* he thought to himself. 

This thought made him uneasy and he couldn't figure out why. Then he looked in his rear view mirror and realized what it was. For the last ten minutes there had been a set of tail lights behind him. He was on a very long, straight, and rural road in the middle of Oregon and there was nothing around him for 100's of miles. The landscape stretched out in pure darkness in all directions. He was sure he hadn't seen a car coming from the other direction and he didn't remember seeing any headlights coming from an off road, so where did those tail lights come from? 

Even stranger was how they didn't seem to be getting farther away. In fact, it seemed like they were getting closer to him. Every time he looked up to his mirror, the lights seemed a little bigger, a little brighter, and definitely a little closer. But how could that be? Why would anyone be driving this fast in reverse? He decided to stop and see if the lights passed him.

Despite most stories being silly ramblings of half-frightened kids, the place did have some odd history to it. 

Every so often a group of adventurous kids would try to explore the house late at night after everyone had gone to bed. Occasionally one of them would get lost in the winding labyrinth  of corridors, staircases, and rooms. The police would investigate, they'd ask questions, file reports, put up posters. All to no avail. The child would not turn up. None of the others had. It was kind of a perplexing and curious phenomenon. It happened so rarely though, and most chalked it up to the child simply running away into the woods and falling into a bog somewhere.

""Please Mister, you can't go in there. Don't you know that house is haunted?""

I turned around to see a small child, maybe about 12, looking up at me and the house behind with awe and fear clearly etched on his face.

""Please, please, don't go in there.""

I smiled and looked at him, offering my hand out. ""Oh, I don't think there's anything to be scared of. Come on, why don't you come with me to the door and we'll find out together. You look pretty brave.""

In her hazy, amniotic slumber, she hears a slight creaking. Then louder. And louder.

She awakens, skin prickling, hair raised. Something’s wrong. She reflexively reaches over to wake her husband only to realize he’s not there. Of course. Emily puts on her robe and slippers, tiptoes into the moonlit hallway. She hears a slight rustle, a punishing silence, and then a louder rustle.

Emily peeks into her daughter’s room, expecting, hoping, to see the typical bulge from under the bedsheets, as familiar as the taste of water. Even in the dark she can feel the presence of her beloved Katie and even begins to walk away, another reflex, chalk it up to the foolish worries of a mother, when she replays the image in her head. There was a shadow at the foot of the bed…

She hurriedly rushes back into the room and sees her husband sitting by Katie’s feet, his face buried in his trembling hands.

“I’m sick,” he whimpers.

Hands shaking, she turns on the light. Before she can shriek, before she can register the red swatches of blood over her husband’s face, his clothes, her daughter’s sheets, he is upon her.

It was clear I was different to everyone else, and they never hesitated to remind me of that. They always laughed as I got help from my teaching assistant; they made sure I felt embarrassed and ashamed whenever they could. I could feel them laughing, mocking me.

Whilst learning to read I’d feel them sniggering in the background. I’d watch as the teacher would point in their face, giving them some stern words. “Yeah really helpful” I thought.
I remember running home after school as fast as I could every time. I wasn’t like everyone else, I never watched TV or spoke to the other kids; in fact art was really my only outlet and relief.  One particular night after school I went to my usual “safe haven”.
I sat there crying in the forest; tucked up inside a hollowed out tree trunk. It was beautiful. I sat there for ages as the raindrops hit the trunk above me. I created the most beautiful, fantasy world I could ever dream of. The rain never ceased up once, and I couldn’t be happier.
The following week I noticed one of my bullies had been absent, as the police came to talk to us. It didn’t take me long to put two and two together, as I watched my class mates erupt into tears. 
My bully’s body was found at the bottom of a well in a nearby flooded wood. No one heard his cries for help; not even me. He must have been so scared, burning out his vocal chords as the rain fell harder and faster.
I was still bullied as the only deaf kid in school, but I always remembered one thing my mum had taught me.
Sticks and stones may break my bones. But words will never hurt me. 
I never returned to my safe haven again.

He was ashamed of his tears - didn't everyone eventually have to retire, so that others might still have a chance to live? Had he not attended scores of retirement parties himself, over the course of all these hard, bitter years? But Ralph couldn't help but be afraid ... because he could already hear them out there, his neighbors and friends; he could hear their enthusiastic shouts and merriment as they made preparations for his retirement. The rapacious eagerness that Ralph heard in their voices made him tremble.

Drying his tears with a swipe of his threadbare tunic, Ralph shuffled over to the bleary wax-paper window and looked up at a gray, roiling sky: there would be another storm later in the day, and it would be a bad one. No wonder everyone was up and busy so early today - later on, they would all be forced to huddle together inside of their dilapidated little houses; they would weep and pray that the fury of the storm would not destroy them with crackling spears of lightning and roaring, caustic winds. The old man observed wisps of acrid-looking smoke drifting past the window, and knew that a fire was already being stoked in the pit, hot and merciless.

A bony fist pounded on the door, hard enough to make the rotting plywood jump in its frame. On the other side, a man's voice rasped, ""Come on, you old buzzard, get on out here before we come in and getcha. You know that we will."" Crying again, mewling piteously, old Ralph shuffled to the door and, shaking like a leaf, he pushed it open. They were all waiting for him out front, waiting with growling stomachs and bright, predatory stares. His mouth opened to beg, but he closed it: there was no use. It was time to retire.

Not that I was some debonair playboy, just that I'd often gotten it so horrendously wrong. But with her, everything seemed to fall neatly into place. We shared the same values, priorities, and interests. Even our temperaments and humors seemed so perfectly aligned. I vowed an oath right then and there that were Nancy not the match for me, then match there would never be.

So after four years of courtship, she and I were bound together in matrimony. Thus spawned my undoing, the details of which I am now set to relate. The first years of our union were prosperous in the form of a delightful young lad, Anthony. As time wore on, the struggles of my occupation and the lady's most intemperate disposition (and how I once lauded it as a reflection of my own!) led to the inevitable dissolution of our once amicable union, though we remained bound by the mutually-perceived necessity of our boy's proper upbringing.

It was noonday in January when the event occurred. Nancy brought me my cup of tea, as was our custom despite much quarreling the night prior. She lingered as I sipped it absently whilst studying the day's paper. The tremors began in earnest as I quite appropriately reached the obituaries. My countenance fell upon Nancy, who only then saw fit to gleefully inform me of the arsenic in my tea. Though the final darkness hastened, providence blessed me with the strength to utter my final three words upon this mortal coil; after which I happily died, having seen them forever wipe that gods-damned smirk from her face.

Your mind on ballets, horses, fairs.

Those metal tines, those grinding gears,

Are raspy music to your ears.

They whir, they spin, within the gloom,

And beckon you toward that room

Where summers stay, and laughs, and love –

Sweet childish memories it sings of.

The dust lies thick upon the floor,

To hush your steps so near the door,

And moonlight, pale, glows from the crack,

But as you reach, it fades to black, 

And with a plink… 

a plink… 

a plink…

The music stops. You twitch, and blink,

Then raise your palm, for there you see –

You hold the music box’s key.

So with a shiver, shake, and swear,

You turn and drift back down the stairs.

You wonder why you left your chair –

A phone call? A forgotten care?
