I'm not going to give out any names or companies or any details that could reveal who I am or who they are because I'm taking this incredibly seriouis.  A lot of you thought this was in person but it was a conference call and they actually now want to meet person so I have lots more to do before this turns into anything real.

I met with two guys, I'm not sure of their titles but I believe they are at VP level in the company.  At first they asked if I'd give them a presentation that I usually give to clients when making sales, I said sure.  Was a bit embarrassing when I popped up the 2nd slide and it was talking about how much better and cheaper we are then them.  I gave the presentation and they asked tons of questions which I answered eloquently but I didn't give out any real sales numbers.

After the presentation they immediately started asking what I saw as a possible way we could work together.  This is where I took reddits advice.  I mentioned how we've licensed our tech before but didn't mention anything much or anything else.  Then they started throwing out all the different ways they saw us working together.  They asked to sign an NDA before our next meeting and they want to meet in person.  I'm so pumped right now but being cautious.  Thanks for all the insight from you guys, I took it all to heart before going into this.

edit: I should also note I kept it laid back and comfortable.  I had met one of the guys before at a conference last year so we were able to remember that and talk like friends pretty much.  Talked about golfing, playing guitar, where we lived and so on.

I'm not successful but I've learned a lot. AMA,Hungryone,221,41,106,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i7nm7/ive_started_5_companies_4_which_have_failed_one/,"Hi everyone,

I did a podcast with a friend and he found my story to be interesting. It's not the typical ""I worked really hard and went through some hard times and now I'm an awesome smart traction attracting bad ass"". It's more of the ""Hey! I'll work really hard and still fail but each time I've learned something extremely valuable but I'm not rich yet"" 

I think this is a good time in my life to discuss what I've learned and what I wish to learn in the near future. 

I'm not a fan of ""stealth mode"" so I'll gladly answer any questions you have on any subject. Every time I've reflected I've found myself growing.

My full story:
I started a tshirt line with a co-worker when I was 21. Our first year we had 30k in sales (about 40% profit). During that time I opened my first business credit card. The banker told me that my partner had bad credit and I should be careful. During the year we ran the company he ran up my credit card to 15k (mostly withdrawing cash to buy lunch). He also pulled out cash to pay photographers/models etc. Eventually we added a third partner (another close friend) which the third person instantly made me realize my first partner was ""Bad"" (to be clear he's not a evil person he was just very irresponsible).

Failure #1

The tshirt line eventually tanked probably because my first partner had a vision for the brand and I had another. When he left I tried to change the brand and it failed with our customers. With all the drama and stress from the debt I decided to quit. 


I took a job at a denim company. The CEO hired over the phone and promised ""If you make my company grow I'll invest any company you want to start"". I was the first employee and I help grow this company from 100k a year to 6M over the next 5.5 years. I was a Creative Director and I handled everything from design to marketing creative. I also created the story/brand/imagery. 

Failure #2
During our growth period my CEO told me ""Are you ready to start your own line?"". I called a designer and my good friend from the last company (the one who gave me insight about my first partner). At this time he was in Shanghai so we had a perfect operation. 1 man in shanghai doing production, 1 designer here designing, and me the ceo/marketer/designer. My CEO cut us a check for 120k. We spent all of it within 7 months and completely failed. I forgot to mention was in 2008 - our last horrible recession. Apparently starting a couture high end clothing line during a recession is a bad idea. Shrug...

Failure #3
The denim company eventually folded because the CEO really wanted to spend millions on marketing (pretty much every national women's magazine you can imagine). It's not truly her fault. The pressure to spend so much came from our customers (every national department store America from Nordstroms to Fifth Saks). That's a long story itself. 

Actual Success!
A few months before the company folded I started playing poker and became interested in it. Ran hot and won about 7k playing 5/5 at the casino. One day I met a really young player at the casino who was really talented (everybody was freaking terrible). He eventually became my coach and backer. The next 3 months I made enough money from him staking me to being able to bankroll myself. I played 150 hours a month and read about 15 hours a month. This was mostly live poker. I did this for about 1 year and 3 months. Great experience.

Failure#3.5
Through a friend's referral I got a huge web project that would pay the bills for 3 months. I stopped playing poker because I realized there were easier ways to make a living. My partner who lived in Shanghai has a strong tech background so we started two companies in Shanghai. We made a chatting app and a cloud sharing service (very similar to dropbox but focus being China).  The chatting app space is way too competitive and we didn't build a very compelling product. To be clear I only help build these in the beginning. The day to day is ran by my buddy in Shanghai

The cloud storage is currently still going and gaining a lot of traction. We've raised a significant amount of money for it. I can't say how much but it's enough to hire 10 employees. If i wanted to focus full-time on this I would have to move to Shanghai and take a huge pay cut. I decided to stay in the US until a little later. As always my good friend would always be there.

I eventually took a job as a Art Director at a Digital advertising company that focused on Mobile applications. I thought this was be a great chance for me expand my skill set. I started as a creative but eventually focused more on product management. I left that company and now currently work at a very big tech company as a Product Manager. Apparently all my failed apps gave me a lot street fred.

Current day:

I'm making something to help restaurants improve their customer service and teach them more about their customers. I started this because I'm a huge foodie and it gives me a chance to meet a bunch of awesome chefs.

Well that's it…….not sleeping on millions of dollars or swimming on a plane ending. I'm a pretty open guy feel free to ask me anything. I'm not smart, a pro, or extremely successful but I've made a ton of mistakes and I'd love to help other people not make the same ones.

And if you're so kind please follow my companies me Twitter!

Like many of you, I was trying to find the most efficient way of promoting our launch without wasting away our modest seed money. Right now Instagram has amazing user engagement so I decided to focus a lot of our efforts in finding influential IG users to help promote Bachelr. I contacted and set up deals with a few accounts with 100k+ followers that were targeted towards men. To my surprise, many of these users were willing to do promotional posts for around $50 or just store credit... awesome! 

For launch day I had them post banners with imagery of our products, like this http://i.imgur.com/p8NYbb2.jpg. The response was so immense that it crashed my server, which is scary but a good problem to have. In two weeks we had almost 20,000 unique visits, resulting into some good sales numbers. That’s a pretty huge ROI for a small investment http://i.imgur.com/FUsIBd0.jpg

I would definitely suggest marketing on Instragram because there is a lot of potential to run an inexpensive and effective campaign. Here are some tips:

* Don’t just post on any account with a lot of followers... find the ones that your target customers are following. I tried a sponsored post on a meme account and got mostly negative comments from their pre-teen followers.
* Make sure your pics are visually appealing and don’t look too much like an ad. One of our most successful posts was a model holding one of our products in a natural setting, no logo anywhere. This got 10k likes and 100+ comments.
* Add your company’s username in the caption so users can follow your account. So far we have over 5,000 followers on @bachelr and great user engagement.
* Make sure your site is responsive and mobile friendly. This is obviously very important nowadays but especially for marketing on IG.

I’ll add more tips if I can think of anymore.",,False,,t5_2qh26,1373664080.0,,,True,t3_1i43ku,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1i43ku/how_i_used_instagram_to_promote_our_launch/,

Full disclosure, I am of the opinion that the bulk of the ""startup scene"" nowadays is a gigantic circle jerk. My frame of reference is doing sales for a company that started out as one six years ago, having been with them the last five, and being part of the transition from startup to one of the best companies in our industry. In the time that I've been with the company, we've gone from $200k in revenue to roughly $28 million this year. I've personally built a portfolio of business from scratch to over $900k recurring revenue, every month, so those are my creds and I feel like I have a decent perspective. 

That said, these are serious questions. 

What has buying into all the finding a co founder, time management, how to succeed, etc, posts gotten you? 

Do people really follow these dime a dozen articles? 

Do you really do nothing but work on your startup? 

Glancing at the article from the other thread, the author touts some post of his getting to #1 on Hacker News, perpetuating the circle jerk, but not getting any outside attention, what's the point of that? 

Is it a measure of success to have a bunch of people doing the same thing give you their approval and sign up for an account they won't use more than twice? I don't see how signups mean anything unless you're getting paid.

1356374678.0,82,self.startups,15ducs,Important SEO Tips for Start-Ups,bobbonew,102,20,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/15ducs/important_seo_tips_for_startups/,"Hey all. I've been leaving start-up feedback and critiques for a bit now and almost always end up leaving some useful SEO tips. I figured it would be great to put together a guide for those who may want some real-world SEO tips, and allow others to leave some suggestions that I may leave out.

A little background on myself, I have been programming for a little over 9 years now and have launched a few websites over the years. One of them was a long-term project of mine that taught me quite a bit - from programming to learning extremely targeted white-hat SEO practices. Anything I'm going to suggest are things I've personally done myself, and have seen first-hand results from.

First off, SEO is something you should absolutely never ignore. I always equate a start-up website to a pizza. One slice may be SEO, and while you may have the other 7 pieces put together, every little bit you can do to position yourself to be setup for success you should do!

- I've found there are two types of websites. A website may either provide a personal utility or offer services. Another is a content website where SEO is something that can offer you a huge boost from. Content websites allow you to literally build up a database and have hundreds to hundreds of thousands of pages of content to. Even if you are only getting 1-5 page views per day, if you have 50,000 pages thats 50,000 to 250k page views a day (1-5 views per page, per day). Product and service websites can still most definitely benefit from these tips though.

- Domain name has gotten a little less important over the years but is still something that can greatly assist you. If you are able to get a domain name that can be part of a main search term on your website, you definitely have an upside. Take 'downrightnow.com' - they're able to capture people searching for 'is facebook down right now' quite easily with 'downright.com/facebook'. They are most definitely drowning in traffic when the likes of Google or FB go down.

- Going on that a bit further, URL is important. Use search engine friendly URLs if you can. Instead of 'downrightnow.com/website.php?fn=view&amp;entity=983' use a friendly URL like 'downrightnow.com/facebook'. If you have a tv show database, 'domain.com/show/8-True-Blood' would be a perfect URL for True Blood. The 8 in the domain name is True Blood's ID in your database. This allows you to keep that as a perma link even if for some reason True Blood changes their name to 'Real True Blood', the url would be 'domain.com/show/8-Real-True-Blood'. Since the ID of the show is 8, extract that from the URL and make sure to detect if 'True-Blood' matches 'Real True Blood'. If it doesn't, issue a permanently moved HTTP header.

- Make sure you use &lt;h1&gt; tags! These are meant to show the main definition of your page. If you can tailor it to a search engine term great, if not don't try to if it looks unnatural. These h1 tags are normally quite large, however they don't have to be. Use CSS to make them any size you want. Make sure they're high on the page.

- Use targeted &lt;title&gt; tags. Make sure they match your page content without being too lengthy. You *can* use your website name in the title tag, but do **not** pre-pend it. Do this instead: 'True Blood TV Show Profile - Mysitename'.

- If you can have text that is in your h1, title tag, and in your search engine friendly URL, that is **exactly** what you want and you're hugely ahead in terms of *really* letting Google know what the page is about. Follow up on this by having 1-3 (I've found at least 2) images on the page that are directly related to that text. 
- - For example, have the True Blood logo on the page. But do it smart. Name the image: true-blood-logo.jpg, use the title and alt tag with the text 'True Blood Logo'.

If you can do the previous suggestions, you'll have an h1, title, URL, and supporting images targeted to exactly what your page is about. This gives the search engines a huge confidence in what your page is about and even though you may be a new site you can start getting some traffic.

- Go further and use H2 tags for supporting information on the page. H2 tags could be 'True Blood Cast', 'True Blood Episode Guide', etc.

I've used the previous simple SEO tips to get a decent amount of traffic in the past. On a 3,000 page database type website I was getting about 5,000 new visitors a day.

**Some tips/tricks:**

- Really do try to avoid completely re-writing your website code from scratch. Google sees this and becomes a bit wary losing confidence in your code. They're not quite sure if it will change again soon, and if it does, will they be directing users to your website with good results? Its their product on the line, and if they're not confident that your page *will* be the same as it was when they first started sending users they will throttle you until that confidence has returned.
 
I learned this lesson the hard way when I re-wrote my website and my traffic reduced to around 40-50%. It was vastly improved from the previous re-write but it took around 6 months for the traffic to return to normal levels. I stupidly re-wrote it again a year later with the same traffic results and it regained its traffic even slower. I'd bet my life that if I never re-wrote it, and slowly deployed updates I'd have been up to 75k - 100k visitors a day. I even kept the link structure the same, no pages were deleted, and no permanent forwards were created.

**Please Note:** If your site is a top site like Reddit or you are getting millions of page views a month, you can probably safety avoid being worried about this happening to your site. A lot of users have been asking about this, and I can only speak from my experiences that websites that were completely re-written/re-done but had the same content and no missing pages dropped tremendously.

- Don't count out the importance of images. If you SEO them correctly as in my previous examples you can garnish a large amount of Google Images traffic. Not all of it converts, but having an additional 100,000 visitors a month on a picture of the earth can't be a bad thing.

- Inbound links to your website (that do not have nofollow on them) are extremely important. What I've found however is that if you push super hard in this area, you don't really get much back for it. I've always let links to my sites happen pretty organically and I've never been slapped on the wrist from Google for it.

Those are the fundamentals that I follow when building out a website. There are so many best practices out there for this type of thing but I've found these suggestions were the most integral and rewarding.

__3. Paid Apps__  
1) The user pays upfront for the full app, usually at $0.99 or $1.99.  
2) It has been shown that price and revenue do not always correlate precisely and you should experiment with various price points. Anchor it with the highest price point and put it on various levels of discount to test out sales.  

__4. In App Purchase (IAP) Approaches__  
1) Currency - Have a virtual currency used to buy boosters and perform other actions. The user can earn currency in-game or purchase more via IAP for faster results. Examples: Farmville's currency  
2) Energy - The user gets a certain amount of actions per energy, and the energy replenishes at a certain rate. Items can be used to replenish the energy, and the items can be bought via currency funded via IAP.  __Needs Example__
3) Unlocking Features - Have premium features such as extra levels or assistance unlockable via IAP. Examples: Angry Birds's Eagle  
4) Chips - Another take on currency, for casino type games. Examples: Zynga's Poker  
5) Freemium - Similar to unlocking features, except the basic app is always free  
6) Subscription - Covered in section 5, can be paid for via IAP or externally (such as Dropbox) 
  
__5. Subscription__  
1) Live Data Feed - Have the user pay a monthly fee in return for up to date data (Newspaper subscriptions, Manazine subscriptions, Stock Ticker Data)  
2) Pay Per Data Usage - Have the user pay a recurring fee depending on how much they use. Examples: Dropbox  
3) Software As a Service - Pay for usage of the software as-you-go. I haven't seen a full SAAS mobile app yet but I think TaskRabbit is a close example. Examples: [Uber](https://www.uber.com/)  
   
__6. Facebook__  
1)[Facebook Approved Ad Providers](http://developers.facebook.com/adproviders/)  
2)Facebook Currency Purchases (Example: FarmVille)  
3)Facebook does not take any cut on mobile app sales!!  
  
__7. Sponsors__  
1) This involves finding third party sponsors and placing them individually in the app. Example: You have an app about tennis, and instead of placing ad-network ads you find a tennis racket retailer willing to pay you $X per month or $Y per click through to their site  
2) [Kiip](http://www.kiip.me/developers)  

__8. Email Lists__  
1) Promote Paid Products - Get paid on traffic/conversion or promote your own paid products  
2) Drive Traffic to a Website for Conversions/Ad revenue  
3) You should use a mailing list manager because it is easy to get flagged for spam. Providers like Mail Chimp take extra precautions to not getting flagged and know who to contact in the case that they do.
4) [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/)  
5) [Comparison of some providers](http://email-marketing-service-review.toptenreviews.com/)  

__9. Merchandise__  
1) Angry Birds has plushies and other merchandise  
2) Imgur has shirts  
3) Starcrafts turned a YouTube video series into t-shirts and plushies with memorable characters  
4) Sell other people's merchandise for affiliate sales (Special version of category 2, Affiliate networks)  
5) [CafePress](http://www.cafepress.com/)

I'm selling it to the highest bidder.,BiometricsGuy,144,60,94,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1b0igu/heres_my_100m_idea_im_selling_it_to_the_highest/,"People come to me with ""million dollar"" ideas all the time, and I try to counsel them on the relative lack of value in just an idea when compared to execution and a team.  I though I might be able to illustrate this with a real example of a $100M idea.  I'm open to offers for a clear license of this idea.

Here's the idea.  Replace the SAT with a computerized adaptive test (CAT).  You can read more about CAT here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computerized_adaptive_testing, but the basic idea is that everyone doesn't get the same set of questions.  Instead, the computer decides what questions you get in order to determine your level of competency.  If you get a lot of questions right, they get harder, and vice versa.  It is used in all kinds of professional certifications.

With CAT, the SAT could take an hour and be scored immediately.  That would be WAY better than the current test, which hasn't changed in over 30 years.

So there's your idea.  You just have to execute it.  All you have to do is convince 1000's of colleges and millions of students that this is a better way to do testing.  It is a better way, so this shouldn't be hard.  Then, you have to upset a company that has an effective monopoly and a lot of influence.  Then you have to build the infrastructure to have this test everywhere - testing centers, personnel, etc.  Once the SAT wall is cracked, other competitors may come in as well, so you need to deal with them too.

So how much is anyone willing to pay me for this idea?  It can definitely build a $100M business, **if you can execute**.  So how much are you willing to pay me for this idea?


If you aren't willing to pay me anything, how can you be so convinced your idea, by itself, is worth anything?  My idea has a guaranteed $100M market.

[Edit: I guess it isn't obvious.  **I'm not serious about being paid for this idea.  This is meant to prove a point about how ideas have no value with execution.**  I actually do think this is a good idea, but I expect it would be $50M-$80M to execute, and it is definitely not a sure thing.]

Any ideas on how to proceed?,jamforce2,87,9,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/zsg27/today_my_university_sent_out_an_email_with_false/,"I attend DePaul University and I noticed a lot of students had trouble finding out about events so I decided to create a website that seeks to centralize all of the events at the university. The site is called http://Eventdrops.com.

Anyways, a few months back, I tried to talk to the head of the office of student involvement into maybe putting their events on the site. Unfortunately, they were anything but receptive. They thought I was going to steal private student information which I vehemently denied. Even though I did not get the support of the university, I shrugged this incident off. We decided to revamp the website for this fall's new school year. I messaged a few clubs at depaul and managed to recruit them to the site. The students were very receptive as well as the clubs that I managed to talk to.

I decided that the best place to recruit organizations to the website was at my school's involvement fair. After talking to a few organizations, the woman that had turned me down a few months back approached me and told me I could not talk to these clubs because I was a ""third party."" I was pretty angry at this point and decided to leave the fair. However, my morale had not been completely destroyed because I knew that I could recruit online, through emails and facebook messages.

TODAY, one of the clubs decided to erase their event on the website and after asking why, they told me they received a strongly worded email from the university to delete their account. The person then decided to forward me the email. The worst part about the email was the fact that it paints my site in such a negative and false light, as if I'm trying to steal the student's information. http://i.imgur.com/kyK1V.png

Is there anything I can do about this situation?

* Pitch your startup in 3 sentences or less where possible
* Don't bullshit - if you want feedback, great. If you just want to launch/get publicity, great too. Just don't try to dupe this sub. There are a lot of smart people here.
* Do take feedback constructively. Its hard to convey tone via text and startups can be a really personal project. Stay objective. 
* Do stand up for yourself if someone's bashing your stuff. Be polite and ask them for constructive feedback or to explain further (see above note on tone).
* Feed the community - come back in a few months and let us know how you're going! Remember to make it a self post (no direct blog links please), link to your original ""launch"" post, and try to add value. What that means is to give us insights in what you have experienced, challenges overcome, lessons learned or other pertinent information to help build the knowledge in the community.

We have 4 team members (2 devs, 1 designer with dev experience and 1 finance/marketing person). All of us have full-time jobs (we've taken in zero funding) and we're trying to get the business to the point that at least some of us can quit to go full time.

I thought it would be interesting to share exactly how we build new features, including which tools we are using and how we use them. I'd love to hear how others do the same thing.

We're building price guides and tools for niche markets, focusing on various collectibles to start. Each collectible has its own site. Example site here: www.mtgprice.com

We are geographically distributed, with a contract developer in the Ukraine, the biz guy in Seattle and the devs in the SF bay area.

We're making some money but nothing special - after all bills (including contractor) are paid, we're making a few thousand a month in profit and have roughly 1 million pageviews a month. (Relevant because we sell display ads for some of the income).

In terms of a tech stack, we're running Java on Google App Engine. 

How we build new stuff:

1. We have a high-level roadmap of the key features we want to add. Initially, this is in my head but now it's written in a short Google doc that we can all refer to. Incidentally, we use Google Apps for documents, Google Drive (+ dropbox) for sharing them and we use the google apps for single sign on for other applications (e.g. our bug tracker). I'd suggest doing something similar since it makes it easy to remove access from, say, a contractor if things don't work out.

2. We use JIRA for bug tracking with the GreenHopper plugin for managing sprints. We're using a hosted JIRA at a cost of $20/month. Ultimately, all of our other tools feed into JIRA so that people only work on tasks that are in the current sprint. 

We have 2 sprints a month - 15 days each.  

3. We use Splunk Storm, a hosted version of Splunk to search our logs for errors. If we find any, we'll write up a bug report and add it to the sprint backlog in JIRA to be prioritized at the next planning session.

4. We use uservoice.com for ticket tracking and feature requests. It's free (for now) and truly excellent. We're planning on upgrading soon. Customers can vote on new features and suggest new ones and we typically make a decision on a feature that was not on our roadmap after 100 votes. Tickets can be turned into JIRA bugs and added to the backlog for later prioritization.

5.  we use qualaroo.com for pop-up surveys. We paid for a year at $550 just recently and we like it a lot. We use surveys for lots of things - right now, we're just trying to work out what we need to focus on to improve our ""one metric that matters"" which in our case is ""weekly returning users"". We have a survey going on most pages asking our customers which feature we should work on next. We'll get much more specific soon. This data is again used when planning sprints.

6. We use google analytics and Kissmetrics to track metrics. Generally, before we add a new feature, we'll ask people (via survey and via email) if it's somethign they think they want. Then we track usage through the analytics packages. This data eventually feeds into our planning sessions.

7. Speaking of email, we use mailchimp.com to manage our mailing lists - one for registered users and another for paid users. Making better use of the 5000 email addresses that we have is high on our priority list.

8. Anyway, every 15 days we have a planning session on JIRA via a Google hangout. We start by going over a few key metrics in kissmetrics, sharing the current bank balance etc. then give a quick demo of the things we built during the sprint. We then take everything in the backlog and try to prioritize the most important bugs and new features to get done in the next 15 days. Being able to see everyone makes communication much easier, as does having a single shared screen.

Everyone has committed to 12 hours per week at a minimum so we usually add 24 hours of work per sprint for each person. Typically this gets exceeded once we start working since a critical bug or user request always seems to come up halfway through the sprint.

Eventually (usually after 30 minutes) we have a new sprint ready to go with the most important work to be done for the next two weeks. We prioritize the tasks for each person and start the sprint.

9. We use Odesk for managing our contractor in the Ukraine. He is awesome. One trick for odesk - contact people directly, don't bother posting a job asking for applicants. We filtered out everyone who was asking less than $20 an hour or who had less than 4.5 stars and then carefully read each posting before asking him to work with us. So far (6 weeks) he has been excellent.

10. Once everyone has their work, I'll typically get stated on my first task. We use github.com to manage our source code (private repo) and I'll usually make a branch and start working there.

11. We use Jenkins as a continuous build server. Our Jenkins server runs on an EC2 instance that was very fast to set up thanks to a Bitnami pre-compiled instance. The CI server ensures that all unit tests are run when code is checked in, and also does things like checks for common bugs. 

12. We deploy nightly from Jenkins to a staging server that has ""production-like"" data on it. It's as close to production as we can get it.

13. We're planning on using Sauce Labs for automated browser testing of our staging server. Night now, we just use Selenium and only for simple tests.

14. We try to write Junit tests for each new feature or bugfix to catch future errors or regressions quickly.

There is much more than this but I think that's enough for now. Any questions?

How do you guys build your software?

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/kevin143 - 	I went back as far as 6 months through his comment history, looking for activity in /r/startups and finding no activity at all here, but lots of comments and posts n /r/health and /r/bitcoin among is other projects that he is clearly trying to make money on.

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/reeksofhavoc - Posts all the time in /r/Entrepreneur and /r/frugal but hasn't been here in forever, I looked as far back as 6 months before getting bored of looking through his comment history and seeking that at 6 months he still had not posted here,

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/jedberg - Is apparently an alt account of a now ex-admin who no longer works at Reddit..but still has not posted here on months, I went back many months on his comment history and not a single post here.

* **Inactive Mod that has now replied to this thread:** /u/chime - Last posted in /r/startups over 2 months ago, spends most of his time in what I would consider engineering and programming subreddits (not that code is bad, I love code).

* **Inactive Mod:** /u/ohashi - Page no longer exists when I check in chrome  so I can only assume he is inactive on every reddit.

* **Inactive Mod:**  /u/Ingenium13 - Hasn't even posted on reddit in over a month.  Spent most of his time in /r/bitcoin and /r/tasker and /r/drugs the last few months before that. Hasnt posted in /r/startups in many months, easily meeting the 6 month inactive bar I'm setting for all of the mods.

* **Inactive Mod that has now replied to this thread:** /u/Xenophon1 	- Spends most of his time in /r/Futurology since he is also a mod there, and has not been active in this reddit for long enough that when I searched his comment history back up to 6 months he did not have a single post here in that time.

* *Active Mod*: /u/PLURFellow - Last active on /r/startups 2 days ago according to his comment history.

* *Possibly Active Mod*: /u/ragmondo - spends most of his time in /r/bitcoin and /r/music these days, but I do see them post here in /r/startups sometimes.. just doesn't respond to messages to the mods.


Reddt rules state that mods must be active every **30** days or so at minimal to keep their roles; This was how the /r/athiesm mod got kicked so we **know** this is the rule as other long standing mods have been removed for inactivity before.  Thus if these mods are not more active soon, they may find themselves no longer mods according to reddits rules.

**I hereby request the following:**

* All mods who have been inactive for more than 6 months (thats most of them) be removed.
* I would like to humbly request to be a mod if nobody else can be found, as I love this community and am clearly willing to invest time and effort into it.  However I do not want to be a mod long term, as I honestly do not want the hassle, so my efforts would be to find a replacement asap.
* I want you to tell me what you would do to make this reddit better, more active, etc.
* It is my personal belief based on the data in front of me that that since so many of these inactive mods like the same reddits - the cluster around /r/bitcoin usage - the possibility exists statistically that some of them are alt accounts for the same person. If this is the case I respectfully ask that they be removed as that's not fair to everybody else.

**Edit:** Thanks to this thread we now have a new sidebar as the mods try to look busy, glad I could help.

**Edit:** I have updated this thread to reflect the fact that out if the large list of people in the /r/startups mod list only 2 people on the list of mods have even responded.

**Edit:** I only posted this after not getting a response from the mods after sending them multiple messages and even offering to get on skype with them as a group.  My offer to chat with them on skype has been ignored, and even my pm's are currently being ignored.  This was my last option.

**Edit:** By my simple and very low bar for activity that I set above ""Has the mod posted at least once in the last 6 months"" I myself am more active than all of the mods combined.

**Edit:** Thank you for your upvotes and support, this thread has been very successful in doing the one thing I actually wanted it to do: Get attention on this issue.  This has forced the current mods to get off their worthless butts and actually do something, including adding the new sidebar and telling me via PM that yes they need to be more active and think about how they support this community.  You are welcome!

I'm done with this thread, it has done what I set out to do: Shine a bright light on the inactive, unskilled, power hungry mods that have captured this reddit that never post because they themselves have no startup experience and are not qualified to be mods in /r/startups

I wanted to report on some recent success that we've had. After trying GoogleAdwords and Facebook ads and not attracting any sales, I thought about how we could get some free publicity. I contacted my local newspaper, tv stations and my university and spun my store and story as ""local highschool grad/current university student travels to Guatemala and starts business to help weavers."" 

Honestly, I wasn't expecting any responses. I figured that I'd have to call them and bug them and then maybe they would do a tiny report. My local newspaper got back to my within 24 hours and the local TV station interviewed my business partner within a week of my first email. August 5th, we had a 600 word article run the [News-Press] (http://www.news-press.com/article/20130805/VOLUNTEERING/308050004/Online-store-helps-Guatemalan-women-achieve-fair-wages) an 80 second long segment on [NBC-2](http://www.nbc-2.com/story/23049447/recent-fort-myers-grads-create-website-to-aid-guatemalan-kids) and an article on my schools [blog] (http://news.colgate.edu/2013/08/viktor-mak-vern-clothing-colgate-internship.html).

It drove a bit of traffic to our site - we got a sale or two - but more importantly, we got contacted by someone who owns a boutiques store and wants to carry our items! We are still processing her order, so I don't want to count my eggs before they hatch, but its looking good. 

The most valuable part I think of this type of publicity is that it gives my company legitimacy. I can approach stores and boutiques and point them to the articles in the local press. I'm not just some random guy. I'm going to be testing the value of these articles with local boutique owners two weeks from now when I return to the states. 

Anyway, I highly recommend this to any small business owner or start-up entrepreneur. While your busy working on your business it might not seem news worthy, but try to find an aspect of it and shoot your local press an email - it worked for me.

Figured I'd share how.",MrDNL,92,27,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/rmp9n/im_selfreferring_1000_clicksweek_figured_id_share/,"Background: In June 2010, I started an email newsletter, [Now I Know](http://dlewis.net/nik), which shares a 500-word story about an interesting fact each day, M-F. I've grown it to over 40,000 subscribers over that time period.  I see the newsletter as a side project/lifestyle startup, not one where VC would make sense (or a $10mm exit possible). I'm always looking for new ways to get more subscribers, and what's worked best are endorsements -- basically, people telling others to check out the site. I've gotten a lot of subscribers from bloggers doing exactly that (and am glad to share examples if you'd like), and about a month ago, it occurred to me that I could probably put together a tumblr which would do exactly that.

Two weeks ago this coming Monday, I started the sister project, a tumblr called [Fact and a Photo](http://factandaphoto.tumblr.com). The concept is straight forward -- a photo and a related fact, published once a day. It's incredibly easy to upkeep -- I just need to keep dumping stuff into the tumblr queue whenever I find things.  The tumblr is in the same ""learn something new every day"" genre as the newsletters.

Fact and a Photo is pretty minimalist. There's the photo, the fact, and on the top of each page, the title of the site. Below the title is a description of the site, and then, in the same-sized text ""Want to learn more? Click here to learn something new every day."" The last sentence links to Now I Know's landing page, and occasionally, a post will have a link to a relevant Now I Know issue.

In two weeks, I've sent 2,500 clicks from Fact and a Photo over to Now I Know, with 1,000 or so coming in the last seven days. About half went to my landing pages, and it looks like 15% or so are converting, maybe 20%, but regardless, that's pretty typical for a vague endorsement. In any event, I'm getting about 20 new subscribers a day from my own (other) site.

As a bonus, this accidental strategy works like any other decent blog would, hopefully building upon itself as it grows. I'm at about 800 followers on the tumblr, and I've had little success in getting links from that medium previously. So maybe in time, I'll become my own biggest referrer.",,False,,t5_2qh26,False,,,True,t3_rmp9n,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/rmp9n/im_selfreferring_1000_clicksweek_figured_id_share/,

I just had to write this down because I'm frankly incredibly frustrated by the unprofessional and terrible hiring process I just went through with Trulia.

The first step to ensure a truly terrible hiring experience is to fire your recruiter and then fail to inform anyone she was in the process of recruiting for a month. Following that, make sure you force the candidates to repeat all the steps they previously finished including a personality test. (Still not sure how that was relevant)

Then, to really fuck with your candidates, have them travel halfway across the country to do an interview. Tell them the next day in the a.m. that it went great and the last step in the proccess is to check their references. Later that day (6 hours to be exact) call them and let them know that your refrences came back great, but that there was a meeting that day and they decided that they're no longer hiring for that position.

I'm really frustrated with the complete lack of professionalism Trulia has shown in this matter. Frankly, in a way, I'm happy the job didn't pan out because I don't want to be part of an organization that is disorganized and shows a complete lack of professionalism.

Tl;dr Trulia sucks, don't try and work for them.

A similar argument can be said about incubators and [accelerators](http://readwrite.com/2012/06/21/startup-accelerator-fail-most-graduates-go-nowhere) but personally I believe they CAN help, especially if their terms are reasonable. Some also can extend the argument to cofounders, that with capital building a prototype or a beta product can be outsourced, as well. I don't have any experience or research to argue any of that, there are different ways of launching and that's what the argument will come down to anyways- but what I want to talk about is how I'm sure that pre-incubators, like the Founder Institute, do not need to exist because of the Internet.

I noticed this subreddit doesn't have a linked sticky in the side bar like the other subreddits, so that's another reason I made this. 

Here it goes, paying it forward, so I hope you find this useful:

**First topic: the Founder Institute and other pre-incubators are not worth it:**

TL;DR: I was accepted to the Founder Institute, and I'm stating that it is not as legit as a real incubator OR a real accelerator program, they have a place but their unreleased statistics (failures) shows that the place is, the majority of times, in the heart of a fool+ reasons and sources.

I got accepted early in February a day after I took the the test, for free- you can take it for free if you look hard enough by the way, but haven't decided to fork up the $900 and 4 months of my time when I'll be in college with connections to the SBA and alumni with real successful businesses. They kept pushing the start date forward because there were mentors missing and not many people were buying into it and sending me emails inviting me to the same information seminars selling the program with this hope speech on how the $900 will be made back with all the coupons you get, how you can do this part-time without quitting your job (yeah; right), and how you'll have time to take out investors to dinners / events to build a bond, they are huge on repeating these things. All of this without mentioning anything important, all fluff- as I say. Disguising really important stuff with fluff and with certain [confidence tricks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_confidence_tricks) classified this to me as a con for hopeless fools. Yes some will get a kick with the media with this, but where are the companies that aren't D startups that graduated from the Founder Institute? Even then you can use the ~$3000 (assuming you have a 3 person team) on advertising and a trade show.

Keep in mind all of their investors are owners of mediocre sites (search for yourself). The Founder Institute does exactly what a local college business / marketing development / alumni center does while giving you ""expert mentoring"" (as they say), give you access and [spots at trade shows / funding events](http://foundershowcase.com/apply/), [connections to thefunded](http://foundershowcase.com/apply/), with some other exceptions, at a loss:

You cannot incorporate without being on terms consistent with those provided by the Founder Institute, you can handle your own terms in your deals though- that's all the freedom you'll get.

You can try the first 14 days while having the chance to get a refund, however, after you've done 45 days you'll be paying $4,500 per team member (if you raise more than $50,000 and make a product in 24 months), forced to give up a 3.5% [warrant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_%28finance%29) as Class F stock of whatever you will raise for the next 10 years and also forced to join a bonus pool, with the people in your class, that you only get a 30% return on.

I assumed the following scenario and got turned off myself, imagine how much of a turn off would this be for an Angel Investor:

A month passes and your 3 person team has gotten a rough product out. You've already invested $50/each for the tests, $900/each for the course fees, hosting fees, time invested, special incorporation fees that god knows how much it costs because it's under the Founder Institute's terms, and other miscellaneous things like gas, food, events, and dinners for the investors. We're at a hypothetical $2850 from JUST the FI fees right now without considering incorporation and what I mentioned earlier. 

An Angel Investor who, for some reason ignored the 10 year pool you guys are tied into and Class F stocks, truly believes in your company and wants to give the team $150,000. $5,250 is going to the pool, $1575 is returned to the team, and each member has to pay $4,500 for the tuition since you just raised more than $50,000. Suddenly $150,000 turns into $136,500. 

At first it seems ok, 3 months passed and you need more money, it was the first Angel Investor- so you brush it off. Now you've convinced a VC firm and now you are raising 2M. That 2M turns into $1,951,000 but it's all for the company- you brush it off and are in denial.

Lets keep repeating this and lets say you raise B at 5M in 1 year, and C at 9M two years after that, then went on and IPO'd two years after that gaining 20M. The process continues, and since it's a warrant they will get valued at the highest amount that's possible. You just gave up a huge chunk of possible company money you could have been using regardless if I messed up on some calculations or assumptions. 

They fell off the map because people can see through them. They ask for too much, and provide mediocre, low level mentoring compared to the real accelerators and ""B"" level accelerators. FI is still a capitalist's dream because people are still buying into this scheme, institutes are still opening world wide! 

There are already niche focused startup accelerators you just have to do the research, also there are obviously angel investors who invest in certain areas too. It's all about being at the right place at the right time. It doesn't hurt scraping an idea, working on another and coming back to a different accelerator or places or trying something new. Just make sure they are not playing any con tricks.

I have links on marketing, seo, and advertising but you can find that all on: [copyblogger](http://www.copyblogger.com/blog/), [kissmetrics](http://blog.kissmetrics.com), [hnsearch](http://www.hnsearch.com/) and [quora](http://www.quora.com).

There are also ways of quick prototyping that don't need to be fancy: [justinmind](http://justinmind.com) and [jetstrap](https://jetstrap.com/plans/signup/educational) come to mind. Well, back when I was using jetstrap it used to be free, so try the good old paper and pen route but remember people like clicking on things and demos / mockups.

If I forgot something, like books? if you're into reading all of the books people suggests- hey it's most likely curated on this subreddit or on quora. You'll find them. 

Besides all of this, you'll stumble upon the information, local / International places, events, meetups, hackathons you'll need to know and go to- in real life. If you ever need more advise, you can save money and not attend a pre-incubator and pay a lawyer, an accountant, and a technical consultant / specialized field consultant to suggest the next steps and still save more money down the road. From there either learn how to code or save some more capital if it's a brick and mortar / hardware business.

I'm wondering what's your response to all of this? Did it help? Am I underestimating pre-incubators? Is the Internet NOT the best resource you can get!?

Just look at all this FREE curated content! You're standing on the shoulder of the Internet! It can take a bit of work but you don't NEED to go to a pre-incubator type entity or do you?

A few years ago at a linux conference a bright young kid (who unbeknownst to me was actually 28 at that point) approaches me because I'm the only other guy there who kind of looks like I'm from his tribe. He's shy, awkward, and brilliant. He grew up in a tiny, backwards town with a very shitty family, his emotional growth was clearly stunted and he eventually decided that he needed to become his own role model.

Over the following months our friendship grew and I began mentoring him. He was an electronics and software geek, just finishing up community college with a 4.0 and about to transfer into a state university to double-major in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. He was afraid of debt, so he was supporting himself by working at a factory in Alaska during his breaks, running some manufacturing control systems. My father helped design the theories which these systems were based on, and I started considering this kid as my own son.

After a few months he revealed his life story, the drug-dealing father, the crazy mother, the ambivalent step-fathers who came in and out of his life. Then he dropped the bomb that he was a registered sex-offender and he was nervous he could never get a job.

His story was very misfortunate. At the age of 17 he made the wrong decision and slept with his 15-year old step-sister. A year later, in a fight with her father, she blurted it out to hurt him. My friend's now ex-stepfather approached him, and threatened to have him arrested.

My friend, being very timid and entirely lacking in confidence, decided that he should quickly turn himself in to mitigate the punishment. He spent a month in prison and was forced to register as a sex-offender, a mistake which has haunted him for 12 years now. he showed me his transcripts and sentencing paperwork because he earnestly didn't want me to shun him. How could I?

This year he is finishing up his degree with a 4.0 average. I've mentored him in various scripting languages and automation-platforms like Chef and Puppet. He's very competent, and has proven his hard-work through his 100-hour weeks in Alaska where he sought as much over-time as possible to prevent taking on any debt.

As you might guess, he is unemployable and worries that his hard work will go for naught. He's received four job offers and was denied these jobs once he honestly filled out his HR paperwork.

With a few years of experience, this might not matter, but as a recent graduate with a felony conviction of the nature, he is shit out of luck. I've promised him he'll make it, and I intend to meet that promise even if I need to start a business with the sole purpose of making sure he is employed.

Any suggestions?

About a couple months back, the doors to my small massage/reflexology store opened. Because of the heavy competition (Foot massages are very common in Southern California now), I made sure that customer service, cleanliness and our services were tiers above everyone else, even our price beat neighboring competitors who didn't offer as much as us. The point was to show everyone that we were not only cheaper, but better in every way compared to other choices.

Well, about a month ago, someone on Yelp contacted me and told me they worked there for over 5 years already and knew about how Yelp could help me about. I knew about Yelp since 2008, when I started yelping myself. Never became an elite but several friends have. I told her that I knew Yelp was a valuable tool but I felt like we weren't ready to start advertising with them since I hadn't hired enough quality therapists yet to start promoting big. She said she'd call me back in a week and touch base. During the call, she explained how there were 19 other active massage/reflexology businesses on Yelp within 5 miles and how I needed Yelp in order for an upper hand against these 19 other choices. I checked on Yelp and there were only about 6 competitors, only 2 had reviews for them. I thought it was weird, but thought nothing of it.

Last night, after getting back from the store, I checked Yelp to find a huge negative review left for my store.. I checked my sign-in sheets looking for the customer, but never found the customer. The profile for the review was created within the same hour the review was posted and there was nothing else filled out on the profile, just a picture that looks like it could've been pulled off of anywhere (instagram? even reddit). I replied the best I could, but I thought it was highly suspicious how an account could be created, a negative review written and it becomes a permanent review as opposed as a ""filtered"" review. My past experiences doing web reputation for companies has taught me that creating an account on Yelp and writing any review right away would automatically flag it as ""filtered"" until you prove yourself otherwise that you're not spam through more reviews, check-ins, etc. This profile, had nothing.. not even a check-in at my small store. 

I've flagged the comment, flagged the profile, and done all that I could. I even reached out to the reviewer in a professional way offering her all her money back as well as a free hour of massages for her and her friend, nothing has happened and it's gotten me really upset. Does anyone know what to do in this situation? Any suggestions?

I’m always reading fascinating discussions on Reddit and other sites about what it’s like to live in different countries and cities around the world, but I’ve found that the same sorts of questions appear time and time again and the best answers end up scattered across different threads and websites.

I decided to build istorical.com to try to foster a community where you can find out everything you’d ever want to know about what it’s like to live in Barcelona, Tokyo, New York City, or wherever else you dream of. You can view and discuss videos, and read and post answers to questions about what the local people are like, the cost of living, things to do there, local culture, nightlife, healthcare, unsafe areas, social rules, and much more.

As of today, istorical.com is a collection of 196 countries, 2,540 cities, 154 videos, and more than 95,000 questions begging to be answered. I’m building this alone, and it’s been extremely rewarding and educational, but also incredibly challenging for me to get even friends and acquaintances to post on the site. If you answered even a few questions about what life is like in your city or country, or a city or country you’ve traveled to or lived in, I would be incredibly grateful.

And of course, I’d also love to hear about any feedback or bugs you encounter, as well as features you would prioritize improving or creating next.

1359751713.0,49,self.startups,17pr87,email from Jason Calacanis about Jody Sherman's death.,cafeinatedd,55,6,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/17pr87/email_from_jason_calacanis_about_jody_shermans/,"A very popular founder named Jody Sherman died this week. He was the founder of Ecomom, and had a wonderful reputation for being relentlessly positive, driven and fun. 

We weren't close friends, but we were friends. I've received dozens of emails from him over the past two years, and he was on my podcast once. We had a 100 friends in common, as he was a human router who left an impression.  

But he didn't just die, he killed himself. 

And it seems like folks are not ready to talk about that issue just yet. Which I can understand. My friend Sarah Lacy wrote a couple of days ago that she didn't want to speculate on his cause of death, nor draw any conclusions to another founder, Aaron Swartz, and his tragic suicide.

I don't want to draw any conclusions either, but I immediately thought of Aaron. Then I thought of Diaspora's co-founder Ilya Zhitomirskiy. They died at ages 26 and 22, respectively, and Jody was 47. All far too young. 

While we don't know the exact histories of each of these individuals, we do know they were all loved. Deeply. 

And we do know all were under massive pressure, be it from a legal case or from their startups. Or perhaps mental illness. 

Ilya's mother reportedly said, ""I strongly believe that if Ilya did not start this project and stayed in school, he would be well and alive today."" 

Let's pause on that for a second. 

Perhaps we owe it to these three amazing humans to examine if the pressures of being a founder, the pressure of our community's relentless pursuit of greatness, in some way contributed to their deaths? 

I've always believed that being a founder is an unhealthy pursuit at times, and few have disagreed -- certainly not those who have done it. Read any biography of a successful founder and you'll find collateral damage around -- and certainly in -- those individuals.

Startups are a full-contact sport. This is a good time for all of us to pause and think about why we're doing this. And the impact it's having on us and the people around us. 

I'm not an expert on suicide, but I am an expert on being a founder. Many of the founders I know have been desperate, depressed and overwhelmed in their careers. For everyone that shared this with me, I'm certain 10 more didn't. 

Could these deaths have been avoided? Perhaps. 

Is it worth exploring why this happens and if it is, in fact, a trend? Absolutely. 

At the very least, as a community we can make it absolutely clear that success is measured not in net worth or how much you've raised, but how you conducted yourself in pursuit of your dreams.

- I am fully aware that everything i know or thought i knew is and was wrong. Looking back on things… We fk'd up. 
- I tried to lay out our situation and how we got here in hopes you could help us fix things.
- I apologize for the length of this post.

Last year, I (thought) i had a revolutionary idea for a business-software product. This idea was based on problems faced by clients at the IT service company i worked for. Essentially the concept was to take all the tools a business needs (and currently use, but hate) and bundle them up into one consistent and uniform solution that ""didnt suck"". I spoke to the clients i worked with at the time and ran it by them. They were excited and said that if it such a solution existed, they would use it. (20+ SMALL business owners)

I decided to get other people involved and form a company to build such a solution. We worked in our free time for about 3 months before it became obvious that such an endeavor would be full time. The other 3 people i was working with were brought on full time with a $25k investment from a wealthy family friend who believed in us.

We all started woking full time. Our salaries were based on our monthly expenses; We took exactly what we needed each month. Just enough to exist.

During the next 4 months we:
	- Finalized design mockups
	- Wrote product specification
	- Incorporated, actually formed a company
	- Brought on a CFO (for equity) and gained an extremely well respected technical advisor.
	- Wrote and re-wrote a business plan many times
	- Launched a landing page, got 1300+ signups within 2 months via paid advertising (9% conversion rate).
	- Communicated with those who signed up to improved the product based on their wishes / needs.

Around 6 months in we started to pitch investors. Former clients, wealthy individuals, anyone we could get our hands on who would listen. We even made it to two of the 3 local VC / Angel groups.

We weren't able to raise a single dime.

Perhaps our biggest mistake was not sitting down and actually building the product. We figured that if we did EVERYTHING ELSE, an investment would be easy because the blueprint was laid. All we'd need to do was build it, advertise, and 9 months of build time later, boom, success. We couldn't build the product without money (only 1.5 of us are developers), we couldn't get money without the product.

Around month 7 we got accepted into a new accelerator program. We were their first company. After speaking with them, it turns out that our product was too massive, we were boiling the ocean. We cut things back, drastically (we thought). Our projected build time was approx 6 months without hiring anyone. 

Still too big. We slimmed it down even more and chose a very specific market to target. We did some basic market research and found it to be about $140MM/year. We were then told this market is too small and we knew of several large competitors in the space already. Several mature startups as well.

Back to the drawing board.

After re-evaluating what it was we were doing this for anyway, we decided to create a new product not related to the old incarnations at all. We thought we had it this time. Launched a landing page, cold called local companies who might be interested, got feedback and a few signups without paying a dime. This was done to prove that someone might want the product.

We were actively and had the ability to build it ourselves within about 2 months.

About 2 weeks in, we realize its quite similar to the solutions customers are already using. We honestly weren't able to answer the ""Why can't i just continue using X ?"" question with any good answer.

Now we're stuck, with no direction and are unsure of how to proceed.

We've spent the last 2 days or so brainstorming different products and ideas. We've made a list and done a bit of research on each only to find that the market for most of them is already overrun or that what we want to do flat out already exists.

- It seems like it's impossible to have a ""new idea"" outside of the biotech / energy fields. (This can't be true, this is what it SEEMS like)

- Anything we've come up with based on peoples pain there is already a solution for, or is too big to be solved in a reasonable amount of time.

- We spent many months without an advisor familiar with startups or how to build one. We have these things now, but the above issues persist.

- TechCrunch is not the real world. Reading it makes one think good things just happen. We're missing something, big. Reading TechCrunch made us delusional.

- We tried to apply our own logic and version of what we THOUGHT was the right thing to do. It was all wrong.

Sooo... as of this moment, we're stuck and unsure of everything we've ever done.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? What should we do / be doing?

My friend wants to buy in 5% shares, how should I work this out?",devceo,57,15,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/16ze81/im_a_ceo_dev_and_ive_built_the_service_and_its/,"Ok I'm a pretty competent architect/web developer/designer and over the past two years I've been spending my free time developing a new business. One year I had a year off work and worked on it full time. The second was part time on weeknights and weekends. I have an interest for it and think there's a good market for it.

The business is an online service and it can cater for international customers. It sells licences to use the service each year and also there's opportunity for selling an additional per hour service to integrate functionality from my site into customer's websites with my site's API. That's all the details I'll go into for now. Let's just say it's brand new, HTML5, very nice looking, easy to use and pretty comprehensive in terms of features I've envisioned for it. It's basically finished, I have a minimum viable product, it's tested and ready to go pretty much. In fact it's been live for several months now but I haven't been actively selling or marketing it as I've been polishing up a few things and not really a sales person. I have had about 100 randoms sign up and try the site, basically from finding it on Google. Also a local organisation that I approached was keen to sign up and use it. But I just haven't had time to do much sales/marketing work myself so I kinda need a decent sales person working on it.

Anyway, now my friend, a colleague I used to work with and get along really well with is interested in helping out with sales/marketing and business stuff. He's a project manager for a big IT firm. Originally he was just keen to do some sales and I offered about 35% commission on licence sales. He was keen for that originally but now he's talking about buying in and having more involvement. As he wants to have some kind of investment, then he can really push it. Now we're at negotiation stage and I'm wondering how I value the company to make it fair for him to buy in. He wants to initially buy in at 5%. To be honest he could be quite useful to have on board and use him almost as a business partner. He's already had some good ideas for the site to make it easier to use and improve accessibility.

Ok so a few numbers high level ballpark style. I estimate I've done approximately 4000 hours on developing it to get the site to it's current state, which I think is sellable and marketable. At 'commercial' rates, if someone had the same idea and wanted it developed commercially (approx USD $100/hr) this is about $400K to develop. I think if I was realistic and getting paid a salary to do the same thing I would halve that rate and it might be a $200K development cost. All the business stuff is set up as well, company registered, trademarks registered etc. I effectively own 100% of the company.

So I came at it from that angle and said:

$400K commercial value

Adjust for risk (50%) as new venture, sales unproven etc  = $200K

5% share buy in = $10K.

I thought it was reasonable but I'm not sure the best way to approach it. He came at it from the angle as an investor. And his thinking was sales are unproven. Product is really good, but there may be some competitors in other countries, but he hasn't done any research on that. He thinks there may be some difficulty in selling as to get current customers off their current processes and using our service (ie the new and better way to do it). I know him to be a pretty hard line negotiator and have seen him negotiate exorbitant pay rises from the company we last worked at together, much higher than other people with similar experience. So he came back with:

Company valuation = $20K

5% share buy in = $1K.

I wasn't particularly liking my 4000 hours (2 years) of effort being only worth $20K so we talked a bit more and realised it is really hard to value the company. His last offer was:

5% share buy in = $2.5K

Then sales targets of the following (meaning if the company makes this much money per year, then he earns that share bonus): 

1) $7000 per year = Another 5% shares

2) $20,000 per year = Another 5% shares

3) $50,000 per year = Another 5% shares

4) $120,000 per year = Another 5% shares 

That would total 25% shares. So tomorrow I'll need to think about making a counter offer. Any opinion/ideas what that would/should be? Or should I walk away from the deal? 

My preference would be just have a commission only sales guy driving the sales. But I also think it would be good to have him on board as a parter in the business. And we have talked about starting a business together in earlier times but that was more of a consultancy based business. It turns out I've already started my own business since then and just need to do the sales / marketing side now and get it out there. But I'd prefer to stay doing the management/CEO stuff and development as for me development is free. It's just time.

What's the best way to value my company? And also give him an option to buy some shares. My concern is he's getting a rather large stake in the company for pretty cheap. He thinks the opposite and that it's a risky investment. He also could be playing it cool and making it seem like he has a pessimistic outlook so he can buy in for cheap. Thing is I don't think he'd be making an offer if he didn't think it had value. I'm ready to take it or leave it. I can realistically just do sales myself if I have to. The costs to keep running the business are like $40 a month so it's not breaking the bank.

So... any ideas? Many thanks.",,False,,t5_2qh26,1358795437.0,,,True,t3_16ze81,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/16ze81/im_a_ceo_dev_and_ive_built_the_service_and_its/,

Feedback and smart insight welcome :) ,stormeen,49,8,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/12p2qh/listnerd_tripadvisor_for_everything_feedback_and/,"I'm a microbrew enthusiast. A few years ago, I got an idea to make a kind of ""Top 100 Beers""-website - so that I could get other people's tips and opinions on the best beers out there. 

I started making a craptastic design, but soon I had an intriguing idea; an idea I just couldn't let go of. Instead of making a single ""Top 100 Beers""-website, what if I instead made a **platform dedicated to user-generated social lists**; so that anybody could make a list about anything? 

After all, I might love beers - but a lot of guys out there like wine, or food, or software, or celebrities - or just about anything else. 

I want to make the entire list-creation process social - so that anybody can contribute and share information. It’s a democratic approach to listmaking. In short, it's Tripadvisor for everything. 

Since the inception of what is now known as ""Listnerd.com"", we've come a long way. We've attracted some seed funding and worked our asses of designing and programming everything. I'd say we're about 2-3 weeks shy of a release, and in this critical phase, we could really use some good feedback from redditors and well, listnerds. 

You probably have something you're really hung up on. It can be the [The Best Beers in the World](http://new.listnerd.com/list/best-beers-in-the-world), the top wine from your country, your favorite Converse shoe colors, a list of the stupidest passwords ever - or anything else. Make a list, add a few items to it - and share it with your friends and other listnerds. They'll rate the items already on your list, and start adding their own. The result? A living, breathing and ever-changing list of the best things in life :)

ALL feedback and smart insight is very much welcome. If you have any questions about Listnerd.com or our process, please feel free to ask away :)

A few months ago I posted about our startup and we got some really great feedback. Some of it was negative and some of it was positive but all of it was helpful. It would be fantastic if we could get some more input from all of you again.

Here's the article:

Promo video: [What is Goalee?](https://vimeo.com/41310287) - Think eHarmony meets LinkedIn.

&gt;Goalee doesn’t just match professionals based on their experience and education, but through their interests, which contributes to sustaining professional relationships. The network works by linking your LinkedIn, Twitter and Facebook if you chose to do so. From there, its system sees what your interests are, where you’re from or what schools you attended and matches you with people who have those things in common.

Sign up for an account here - [Goalee.com](http://www.goalee.com)! It's **free** to use for as long as you like - or you can choose to upgrade to a premium account to receive more contacts. Users create their Goalee profiles by using their LinkedIn and Facebook logins so there is no need to remember a new username and password.

We have around 5,000 users so far after launching the beta version to the public a few weeks ago and it would be really great to get some redditors on there as well. Let me know what you think!

I think my edge would be providing an exotic and authentic food (I'm white American) for a low price, 15 rmb(?), &lt; $2.5/burger. 

There are many street vendors in China but I've never encountered a foreigner or a hamburger vendor. I think the idea has great potential and was inspired after seeing [this video](http://www.liveleak.com/view?i=385_1373127855) of two foreigners selling 200 burgers per night in a smaller city up north called Shenyang.

  **Environmental opportunities** include a trend in the increase of beef products in China, low cost materials, little overhead and low regulation (to say that China's food regulations are more lax than those of the US would be an understatement).

**Threats** include rising costs of beef and compromising whether conditions (without a restaurant, the business and the customers would be exposed to heavy and frequent rain in the spring and the occasional typhoon in the summer time, as well as mild winters).

**Personal strengths** include familiarity with business strategy and accounting principals and available cash on hand. Also and perhaps not obvious to the unitiated, being a white foreigner really lends to the perception of a genuine product, when said product is Western.

**Weaknesses** would be my lack of cooking experience, however I aim to keep the product simple initially. Also my unfamiliarity with Chinese laws, regulations and suppliers would require the aid of a Chinese partner or close friend.

They are pre-Series A, currently funded by angels, and generating revenue. They have fewer than 10 employees, and I will be joining as a remote software engineer. I have a Master's in Computer Science and about 2 years experience as a web developer.

What is a decent salary to ask for? Glassdoor says that software engineers in the SF area make about $90k on average. Does this seem right? Does this number go up or down with startups? Does the fact the I'm working remotely decrease my potential compensation?

They will almost definitely also offer me equity; however, I believe the sad truth is that this equity will likely be worth very little in the long run (either dilution through further rounds of investing and/or a bad exit). I'm optimistic, but the equity offering is basically just a bonus to my base salary.

How far off am I? Is $90k too much to ask for? Should I dodge the ""What is your number?"" question and have them state a number first? Any and all advice is welcome.

Our goal is to provide quality lessons for drummers at a reasonable price. We have been working on this project for a year now and have only a handful of subscribers. I am hoping the amazing readers of this subreddit can point us in the right direction because we feel as though we should be successful and we well...we aren't.

Here is what we have done so far:

1.Created 100's of video lessons

2.Built yourmusicmuse.com and the member area complete with blog, forums, video comments, progress meters, and various other tools.

3.Advertised with google adwords and have spent close to $1,200 with very little roi...i'd peg it at about 0.5%

4.Advertised on some major drumming websites with a similar roi

5.Created a blog and post once or twice a week

6.Concentrated on SEO and moved our homepage almost to page 1 for ""online drum lessons""

7.Contracted a famous drummer (Jeremy Hummel-Breaking Benjamin) to shoot 17 lessons

I am laying this all out there for people. We have so much time and money wrapped up in this and we do everything except teach the lessons. If there is anything you can see that might be hindering our success please post even if it eviscerates our egos or you just think we should call it a day.

I was just taking a brain-break after a long night of studying back in October, and had a vague concept of an idea pop in my head.  I jotted down some notes, did some sketches quickly, and began to think a bit more.  I emailed my close friend (and now partner) to tell him and get his opinion.  He loved it and kept repeating to himself, ""holy shit...holy shit...""

We spent the next 6 months emailing, calling, and getting in touch with anyone and everyone we could who could potentially help us.  Family, friends, coworkers, friends of friends, ""some guy"" that someone knew, etc.  We worked our way through software company reps, to VCs, and various consultants, and at the end of it all, we were basically back where we started.  With nothing.

That was until two nights ago.

I got a call from my partner, who was already talking before I even picked up the phone. 

He told me that the incubator group/seed fund that we'd got in touch with 1-2 months ago had finally gotten back to us after reviewing the idea.  They're giving us office space, two free interns to develop the program, and a slot in a monthly event to present our idea to investors monthly at a large auditorium.  All of this is free of charge, since they're an incubator.  

This program starts in June.  My partner is brilliant and doesn't feel the need to go to college this year (he'll be attending UChicago in 2013 though) but I will be attending college since I got into the b-school at a pretty highly ranked school.  We're getting a partnership written up which will include how much % of the company each of us owns (the partners are me, my friend, and his dad-who has many, many connections in the business world).

The incubator told us that by mid-June, they'd like us to have a promotional video for the program, as well as a detailed business plan.  The video shouldn't be too difficult to manage, and my friend seems to be confident about writing up the plan.

What should we be focusing on now? In a month? In 6 months? In a year? Where should we be aiming to be? What should our goals be? What are some things that may unexpectedly happen? What are some things we should look out for?

Someone who's been there and done that, please, please help.

--------

MAJOR EDIT- I realized I completely fucking blanked on a huge aspect of this my partner has been handling. 

Our programmer isn't the free intern. We're working on a deal with a software company that's giving is developers for a stake in the company. The intern is just some additional help. 

Once the deal is worked out with the software co, building will begin immediately. Sorry about the confusion..we've been handling different aspects of this idea for the past several months..a lot of this slips my mind, especially with everything happening all at once.

Here are the most common types we see in this subreddit,leanstartup,75,40,76,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/yx8el/some_startup_ideas_suck_here_are_the_most_common/,"No idea is automatically going to fail, but a smart entrepreneur should take notice of general trends and avoid obvious mistakes. Here are the 5 worst types of startup ideas:

**1) Startups serving startups -** How much will you pay for a random person to give your startup a name? These so-called businesses are usually the product of incestuous communities of frustrated wannabe entrepreneurs. They pretend to offer products that entrepreneurs will buy. In truth, the founder usually has lost touch with reality and vastly overemphasizes this market. Most experienced entrepreneurs are trying to *avoid* buying these products. There are so many examples of these companies in r/entrepreneur that it's kind of scary. The worst flaw of these companies is that they depend on a constant stream of bad startups for their revenue, as only a fool would waste money on this nonsense.

**2) T-shirts -** There were several kids in my middle school who had this kind of 'company', which shows how ridiculous this trend has become. A well-drawn graphic is not the complete foundation for a successful enterprise. There are very few good ways to grow or create lasting value with this type of business.

**3) Social Networks/Blogs/Communities -** The owners of these content-heavy sites are almost always creating a lifestyle business that relies on their manpower and, in return, will barely support them. It is a wonder that people who have never created/managed a simple enterprise think they can begin their careers by creating two-sided communities with major interactive features. The competition in this arena is so thick that all producers are guaranteed to have a difficult battle. Startup costs are enormous, especially with non-technical founders.

**4) Coffee shops -** There is a coffee shop on every corner, and corporate giants rule. This is a textbook example of ""founding"" yourself a high-anxiety, minimum-wage job.

**5) Submit your own -** What common ideas do you think entrepreneurs should usually avoid?

To cut it short to the question: - I myself struggling from a common problem = too much thinking:) While it can be a blessing - it's also a big show stopper for many things. 


I guess I should be not alone in that. I have certain amount of ideas for products \ services I think could be useful, but the more I dig in them by thinking - the more problems I ""invent"" or foresee and the motivation to proceed with any of them - fades out.



If you had any successful or even just nice experience with a project of yours - what made you do a first step? How did you think of it? was it a blind gambling or a result of a thorough analysis. 


p.s. I understand that there is no formula for success:) I just want to see if I'm not alone in my ""struggles"" and may be this gives me courage to proceed, take a step, as well as it might help others:)

I need a pencil now. I'll look elsewhere.**

Quick rant on a problem I see far too often in the startup community. Startups take a decent idea, push out a hollow landing page or MVP, get bored/give up too early, and then pivot or start something else. This is then generally accepted as ""it's been done before, and it failed"", as if the idea itself failed - when the fact is that the piss-poor execution failed. 

This is why I look negatively at MVPs and landing pages for non-existent products. While theoretically a smart way to gauge interest or spend the least amount of time failing, in practice they promote uncommitted, piss-poor, spoiled, ADD execution. If you know you're solving a problem, stick with it and iterate until it people like it. 

So next time someone tells you ""x has been done before many times, and it failed"" - remember that decent ideas aren't what fail, it's the execution that fails.

""Sale of www.""his web site"".net including all files, website content, documentation, email lists, facebook &amp; twitter accounts, 60 day support period.""

That is the extent of our agreement, there is nothing else ""official"" in writing.

So he sent his money to Escrow.com, and after that happened I began delivering the items described. He currently has my website running on his server, he has downloaded copies of all of my website and source files, and he has received passwords or admin access to multiple accounts such as email, Facebook, and Twitter. All of these items are complete, and I have emails reflecting that he acknowledges receiving everything.

Now, right when it's time to conclude the transaction and pay me, he asks to see traffic stats. He saw my traffic stats 6 months ago when he first inquired about buying the website, but at the time he changed his mind. Now, during the course of this transaction, he has never asked about traffic until the very end after getting everything from me. Traffic has declined since December from about 500 visits/day to 250-300 visits/day and he is claiming that the decline in traffic is grounds to terminate the transaction.

My main question is: Does he have a case? If this goes to arbitration at a website such as American Arbitration Association, JAMS Arbitration, or net-ARB.com, what are my chances of winning?

Thanks a lot



Any thoughts, experiences would be greatly appreciated.  I will prob post in a legal sub as well...

Thanks in advance

1329157299.0,29,self.startups,pnr0j,I'm a former corporate lawyer who's decided to use my powers for good. I've made an open-source system to let you copy/lend/share files and media privately with friends. It plugs into a site where you can add friends and recommend stuff to them. Any techies willing to help test?,mikeliu8,33,4,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/pnr0j/im_a_former_corporate_lawyer_whos_decided_to_use/,"I'm a dual-class programmer/lawyer. I'm launching all this under my real name. I'm a long-time Redditor, but I'm posting this here under a new account using my real name as well.

The open-source system is called [the Mixologist](https://github.com/librarymixer/The-Mixologist). The website that it works with is called [LibraryMixer](http://librarymixer.com).

Many have tried before to create software that builds darknets (decentralized, private networks that connect only to your friends). However, darknets have a lot of difficulties that have kept them from being user-friendly enough to gain traction. 

I've designed a hybrid system where basic, non-sensitive information such as friends lists are handled through the website, and adding friends or notifying them of your activity is as easy as using Facebook, while all of the communications and file transfers over the Mixologist are direct, encrypted P2P connections and still fully decentralized and private.

The real benefits emerge when you add reviews and lists of what you have or want on Librarymixer, highlighting them for your friends. The world of media is oversaturated with interesting stuff out there, making the problem not how you should get stuff you want, but how you should find the wheat among the chaff. When used together, LibraryMixer and the Mixologist offer the integrated experience of recommending music or videos or books to your friends via your reviews, and if they're interested, the ability to immediately ask to get those from you using the Mixologist via a single click on LibraryMixer.

It's also possible to just drag-and-drop entire folders on your computer into the Mixologist, which your friends can then browse. Or, if you're purely interested in the media reviews and listings, LibraryMixer itself is a fully functional, independent website, and you don't even have to install or use the Mixologist at all.

Unlike past P2P file sharing services that have realistically only had minimal non-copyright infringing uses, this system provides a whole range of other functionality besides just sending copies of files, such as lending and borrowing files, responding with automatic messages (think: ""Got your request, will bring it next time I see you.""), privately browsing and downloading from your friends' personal collections such as their photos, etc. In this sense, like GMail or instant messengers that are neutral tools, it makes it possible to treat users as adults and place the responsibility of staying within legal limits on the users of the tool. In other words, like back when we had VCRs (if you guys still remember what those are), the VCR had the capacity to record ten thousand copies of that Blockbuster video tape you rented, but at the end of the day, it was only you that prevented yourself from doing that.

I'm hoping for a small group of volunteers to help test this before I launch. I'm posting here because it would be great to round up a few tech-savvy Redditors willing to add each other as friends on LibraryMixer and also willing to use the Mixologist for a week or so to give me some honest, substantive feedback.

If this goes anywhere at all in the future, you'll be sure to get some sort of special recognition for helping alpha test. 

I'd be super grateful if any of you would be willing to help out, and I can set you up with an account if you email me at mikeliu@librarymixer.com.",,False,,t5_2qh26,False,,,True,t3_pnr0j,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/pnr0j/im_a_former_corporate_lawyer_whos_decided_to_use/,

I currently work for a startup that's not quite a startup anymore. Since joining I've seen the company grow from 5 people to 70+, including a sizable and skilled engineering team that I manage. I've been working my ass off for almost 3 years, and my options have fully vested. I'm considering buying them and figuring out what my next adventure will be.

I feel apprehensive about it though. I'm young, I am well compensated, I have a strong team of engineers, I work on an interesting product. Why would I want to jump ship? Well, it's not all roses and rainbows. As we've grown, raised funding, and brought in decent revenue, we've hired several ""drop-in"" executives to manage other teams. We don't promote from within (I'm the sole exception, it seems). I've had a few personality clashes with our CEO. The company has become much more sales focused, and we're clearly not an engineering-focused company any longer. We're a mid-sized company now, the magic of the early days of a tight team of ambitious people is a memory.

After 3 years of late nights, working weekends, seeing my personal life and my health slowly deteriorate, I'm almost at my breaking point. I have always known that my future is to found my own company, but I'm so chronically stressed and exhausted that the thought of launching into it full steam ahead is more daunting than ever. I have more than one standing offer from other companies, but I'm not sure that I want to go work to make someone else richer (again --- let's be honest, even the first few employees of a startup are working to make their founders rich).

With the experience gained from each failure, this would suggest that the 'average entrepreneur' should see some success by startup number 3-5.

The typical interview with a successful entrepreneur on sites like Mixergy seem to back this up, with a lot of people having 1-2 failed startups previously. I've also come across plenty of blog posts about failed startups.

What I'm curious to see is if anybody has any links to, or stories themselves, of entrepreneurs who have failed time and time again launching startups. These stories seem to be much more rare, and I would assume a lot of people may, understandably, give up after one or two crushing defeats. To give an idea of the type of person I'm attempting to describe, it would be someone who perhaps did something like the following:

* Startup 1: Side project turned startup, no real direction, launched without doing any market validation / customer development [Failed]

* Startup 2: Created a solution they thought would work really well, built the product without validating first, limited customer development, pivoted based on customer feedback [Failed]

I run PaleoPax. The business has two components with a third under development. In order:  
  
* [Monthly Subscription Box](http://box.PaleoPax.com)  
* [Classic Ecommerce Store](http://PaleoPax.com)  
* Paleo snack distribution to CrossFit gyms  
  
The subscription business is simple: I box up and send 5 new products each month. People like this because the paleo diet is tough to snack on due to lack of availability. I do the hard work of finding fun and different snacks, and send them to my subscribers. Hopefully each month, everyone likes at least one product enough to buy it again, and overtime paleo snacking gets easier and easier for them.  
  
**I don't believe I can scale the subscription business over 500 users**, as most of the products I send are from mom-and-pop sized businesses. They can't produce the volume I'd need, and even if they can they lose they ability to give me free products or huge discounts anywhere above 500 units. This cuts into my profit, which is what we're here for.  

I'm not going to be buying any yachts, but the subscriptions alone pay my bills, and let me not have a 9-5. I can continue as is with this, sacrificing some mind-share I could devote to other projects, but keeping me housed and fed.
  
The drop shipping business is treading water. I sold a few thousand dollars of merchandise my first month, but it has dropped since then. I am not an email marketer. I don't like doing it, and I'm worried I'll drive away subscribers by becoming too salesy. (**Honestly, if anyone wants to try their hand at it, I'm very comfortable paying a solid percentage of the increase in sales.** That said, don't message me about that unless you really have your shit together as I don't want to do any hand holding. If you can kick ass, maybe we'll do something.)  
  
CrossFit distribution was tested in my local gym. Some stuff sold, but it is a hassle for the trainers to handle cash etc. I'm not sure I can get enough gyms involved to make it work. Buying product through me is significantly easier than getting wholesale accounts, but the question remains whether the value-add for the gym owners is worth the hassle. The value is two fold: small profits, and happy gym members.  
  
That's my entire business.  
  
Anyone think I should try to grow the subscription business regardless of the previously-mentioned constraints and/or have a clever way to circumvent the problem?
  
Anyone want to help out with the store?  
  
General comments on the CrossFit distribution revenue stream?

**Edit:** I don't sell my monthly boxes through the Crossfit Gyms. I intermediate between the producers and gyms, making it easy for the gym owners to buy from dozens of producers at slightly-marked-up-from-wholesale prices, all on my site with one credit card. I already have relationships from the monthly box with the producers. Leveraging those lead me to the online store as a second revenue stream, and further leveraging them could result in me making a commission on individual products sold in gyms.

1339372419.0,30,self.startups,uvant,r/Startups - Message from a moderator (not all the moderators),ohashi,41,11,18,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/uvant/rstartups_message_from_a_moderator_not_all_the/,"Hi guys, I am A moderator here, but I am not the top mod/creator.  I want to say a few things about what's been happening in this subreddit lately.  Everything here is my opinion and MINE alone.  I don't represent the moderators or the creator of this subreddit.

**moderator participation**

The mods aren't some uniform group that even talks that much between themselves.  As far as I can tell, we mostly unspam posts that get stuck.  This subreddit doesn't have any real rigid rules put in place by the creator/top mod(s).  *I don't feel it's my place to change someone else's subreddit*.  So I won't simply enact some new rules.  It's not my place to do so.

So when you complain about the mods, we're all individuals doing different things with different commitments and levels of comfort doing things.  I've reached out to kevin143 (the creator/top mod of this subreddit) asking him to step in or make some sort of decision about a lot of issues in terms of content being posted.  You are free to do the same.  Don't spam or be rude though, if you have some real suggestions please message it in a professional and polite manner.

**content / spam**

There have been a few posts about blogspam filling this subreddit up.  Crappy content sucks.  I agree.  However, we don't have any strict rule in place about content.  We simply have a statement that reads:

""*Please submit stories to any good startup stories, any story you feel makes the net information of this subreddit better.*""

That is very wide open and hard to enforce any hard rules about what type of content gets submitted as its very subjective.

However, reddit has given YOU, the user, an amazingly powerful tool.  You can upvote and downvote the good and the bad.  If you don't like a certain type of content, downvote it.  if the majority of users agree on what they do and don't like the quality will go up (at least for those in the average in terms of what they like).

This requires effort.  Every subreddit has the same issue, some users need to actively participate on the new submissions and help decide.  Bigger subreddits are easier because more participants mean more people handling that content filtering.  It doesn't happen magically in smaller/less active subreddits.  It requires YOU to help out.  Every subreddit gets a lot of crappy submissions, someone has to help filter them.  The burden on you is going to be greater in a smaller/less active subreddit.

You can also improve the quality of this subreddit by submitting good content.  Find and submit good relevant content.

As it stands those are the two options to improve the content here without any rule changes.  

**Participation / communication**

Startups are a labor of love and evoke some very strong emotions.  I am tired of seeing reports about users harassing one another and complaining about being downvoted/reported as spam/rude.  A lot of people here are very frank and may offend with their opinions.  If you feel offended don't start a flamewar and complain about it later. Thank them and move along to better things.

Some people are just assholes, they exist, they are here, they are everywhere.  If you can't handle them, ignore them and move on.  No sense wasting your time.

As a moderator, I am not censoring anyone no matter how much I dislike what they are saying.  Downvote it if it makes you feel better.  If enough people agree it gets hidden away at the bottom where nobody reads it.

For the commenters, you can make this place better too.  Engage people constructively and if they take it poorly, then move on, some people don't really want your criticisms or can't handle it.  Leave them alone and make better use of your time.  Share your stories, experiences, and opinions with those who do want to hear it.  They are here too.

Finally, try and be civil and polite.  It makes for a better overall experience for everyone.


**Conclusion**

In summary:

* Downvote bad content

* Upvote good content

* Submit good content

* Don't be an asshole

You can make this subreddit better today if you want to spend the effort.

If you have more ideas/suggestions feel free to post them here.

While hunting for a decent used car using the usual methods: craigslist, ebay, etc. I was on the freeway when a car drove by me with a For Sale sign in the window. The make and model were what I was looking for, but how would I ever be able to find out more (mileage, condition, etc) and contact this person? We’d both have to be parked to safely get all that info from the For Sale sign. Or try some good old fashioned tail-gaiting.. but didn’t want to risk denting my future car! A similar situation happened when I was apartment hunting and seeing For Rent signs in home windows as I drove around. What if the world ran on short-tags, what if I could spot a huge printed #2N, know to go to a website, and look it up for more info?

The solution:
We came up with TerseTag as the solution, allowing people to say everything they want with a QR code and short tag.

Is it just another QR code creator? Sure, you could say that. Is it just another URL shortener? Sure, you could say that too.

We love how QR codes provide a way to get from the real world to digital content, but studies show using QR codes is a mixed bag. Some people never bother learning how to scan them, possibly because it can be technologically intimidating and unfamiliar. That is why TerseTag offers short, memorable tags that people can quickly write down and lookup later, tapping into a simple and familiar act that we all have done by writing down someone’s phone number or email address.

Please check it out and let us know what you think, thanks!

Brief: As a designer who knows how to use Photoshop, I get friends and family who always come to me to help them with editing their photos to make them appear better. There are plenty of photo retouching businesses on the web, but you never have a clear idea of what they can do for you. Then I also stumbled upon /r/picrequests where many people create requests for their images to be edited, and there are already a large number of people who voluntarily help others. This gave me more encouragement. Then of course you sometimes see those photoshop trolls who create funny edits and give us a good laugh. So then a friend and I decided, why isn't there a dedicated site that offers this type of image editing engagement. Thus we created Zhopped. The goal of Zhopped is to be the first place to goto whenever someone needs an imaged edited. 

Right now, we have already got a few users on our site, creating requests and a few editors helping them out free of charge, similarly to how /r/picrequests works but in a more approachable web interface. We found that many people are willing to help others. It's very humbling to see. If it's a simple 5 minute edit, why charge someone an arm and a leg for it. For the more demanding, professional photo editing, we do believe people should be compensated for. We are planning on creating a marketplace similarly to how freelancing sites work and NOT like some of the existing spec work sites. 



Who benefits:

Requesters - Now everyone has an easy, intuitive interface in which they can upload a picture to and have their work done.

Professional editors - Now any professional editors (artists, illustrators, photographers) who have some spare time can come to our site and earn some extra cash through our marketplace

""Hobbyist"" editors - I categorize these editors as hobbyist because they may not have top level, professional training, but they do possess photo editing abilities. Hobbyists enjoy fiddling around with image editing software. Zhopped allows them a gateway to practice their craft, and help others at the same time. They can also participate in doing the professional work in the marketplace as well. You don't need a certificate to be paid. If you have the potential to provide quality work, you can also get paid for it.

In creating this community, I hope that everyone knows Zhopped is the place to go whenever they need image editing. I also hope to maintain an open community so anyone can join to help edit pictures either for fun or to earn money for doing it.



We're talking with the general public (potential requesters), professional editors, and hobbyists on how they feel about this and creating some iterations on how the marketplace should be shaped. The site is functioning without a marketplace right now so people can get a feel of how it works and for us to evaluate the interaction as well. We'd love to hear some more feedback, improvements, suggestions, what you don't like, etc. We love hearing critiques. Feel free to msg me as well.

I now own a tech company in SF, but would still intrigues me is the most basic businesses out there. In college, I had a hot dog stand and it really taught me about business...and I'm curious if anyone would be interested as well.
----------------------------------

I'm thought about making an online class. I haven't made it yet, but if people are interested then maybe I'll make it.

Background: When I was in college I wanted to start my own company with that was fun, outside, and didn't take a lot of money to start...so I did a hot dog stand.

Most hot dog stands are run by redneck old dudes but I was an arrogant 20 year old college kid...so I (unfortunately) didn't take a lot of their advice because I wanted it to be young and hip.

So I thought about putting something together a step-by-step course. Here's what it would contain:

1. How to register a business...who to call, where to go, and what to say
2. How to buy a cart
3. How to get certified by the health department
4. Step-by-step website set up
5. Registering for Square and taking credit card
6. Unique menu's that I used and tested
7. What starting supplies to buy and where to get them, including Amazon links
8. How to find a spot 
9. Email and phone templates for cold calling places when asking to set up on their property
10. Templates for fairs, concerts, and other places you wanna partner with
11. How to interact with customers, including scripts and drills for shy folks
12. Little tips like adjusting prices for lunch vs. drunk night hours
13. Other ""dirty secrets"" like using cheap ketchup on drunk people, how to get tips, and the golden product (bottle water)
14. How to pay taxes
15. How to cook
16. Twitter, Instagram, and other social media gimmicks to get you popular
17. Marketing tips, like setting up Yelp pages
18. How and when to buy merchandise 
18. How to be unique
19. Finally, a ton of funny stories I had including areas I failed in, so you can learn

About my business

Name: Southern Sam's
Was in business for 1 year. Some days made 50 bucks, some days made $800.
Hired 3 people...including the ""Bikini Weenie Girls""
Slogan was ""Wieners as big as a baby's arm""
Ran it while in college.


Anyway, I haven't made this yet but if people are willing to buy it then I will. I'm thinking I'd charge $50 bucks. You'd get videos, doc's, my cell number so you can ask questions via text, and maybe some other stuff.

If I get a good enough response here, then I'd most likely give it out for free or cheap so I can get feedback.

You can see other users nearby (your actualy location isn't disclosed) and message/connect with them.

There is also a virtual passport feature where you collect stamps for every city you check in to.

Note: I'm extremely brief so please ask me anything i have not covered here, in the comments.

Site: [MyAppTemplates](http://myapptemplates.com/)

**Quick backstory**

So i've been making apps for over 2 years now and a few months back realized that i was spending a lot of money (and time) on the design and early stages of my app which did not allow me to focus a lot more of my resources on what really matters - marketing. 

Add to that the fact that design is probably my biggest weakness in entrepreneurship and you can see how this problem needed a solution, fast.

I saw that the wordpress market allowed for people with no design or development skills to make headway by providing them with usable 'themes' and wondered why there were no 'themes' for iphone apps. 

I looked around all over the web and found that no one was really providing this service in any kind of professional way, and so MyAppTemplates was born. 

So far i have (with the help of others much better at design than me) created 7 unique and usable templates, complete with a usable Xcode sample code and full design PSD's.

Sales have been slowly rising month to month, and i'm very optimistic.

Right now, we're averaging low to mid $x,xxx's a month.

I'm hoping to grow this quite dramatically over the next few months but am still trying to think of the best channel(s) to market this. Any advice would be appreciated.

As i mentioned above i tend to be very brief and so may not have included as much juicy details as i should have above - please ask anything you'd like to know in comments and i will answer. 

Here's that special offer for anyone who'd like to try the templates out!

**Special Offer**

For anyone who would like to try out our templates, i've created a coupon that will allow you to purchase 4 templates of your choice for the price of half of one. 

So you get 4 $99 templates ($400 value) for just $50.

Well, since this subreddit was created.

I'm telling your right now, DON'T USE YOUR REAL ACCOUNT.

Why?  Because a simple WhoIs search is all that is needed to find out everything about you, unless you have been smart about your registry and paid for the extra privacy. 

Unless you have those privacy settings in place, anyone on Reddit can find out who you are, and where you live.  And unless you have a ridiculously common name, they can also use that information to find out your Facebook account, Myspace, Twitter, etc. etc. etc.

Now, while the majority of people wouldn't even think to try a whois search, and even less will use that information against you, it only takes ONE person to cross that line and use that information to ruin your life.

The reason you shouldn't post it under your reddit username is that people often have interests that they wouldn't want their family and friends to know about on reddit, and it can be used against you.

If it's not under your real username, they have nothing they can really use against you, except what you already have on Facebook/your website.

Don't give trolls the chance.

PS.  Just in case you are wondering why I posted this, it's because I recently stumbled upon a guy posting about his website, and was able to find out in around 5 minutes his name, his address, his Facebook, where he went to school, where he works, his family, his interests and much, much more.  I then told him straight away that his personal information was compromised by his post.

While I was just curious... There are more than a few people who would use it against you.  Don't let them.

EDIT:  Obviously I was wrong to try and tell people how much of their personal information can be found from a simple whois search.  Quite apparently, 90% of the people on reddit don't care if their friends and family can view their entire reddit history, so it's not a big deal, my bad!",,False,,t5_2qh26,1369153116.0,,,True,t3_1er5wg,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1er5wg/do_not_post_your_website_under_your_real_reddit/,

Turns out – I suck at marketing. Feedback?,picketproject,35,7,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/14oqt5/worked_4_years_on_designing_an_open_source/,"**Edit for clarity:** 4 years of research, designing, and creating prototypes before feeling confident enough to present my effort. 

**Update:** Thank you so much for those that gave great feedback. You all are awesome! I have updated the site - hopefully I did your feedback justice.

**My Story:**

I began working on this project in early 2009 to enhance the way people understand each other and work together on political issues. My hopes were to provide a platform for helping large groups to work on problems by expressing each of their own opinions, mapping their ideas together and then effectively ""averaging"" their ideas to display a compromised solution to the problem being addressed. As much as anything, it's about recognizing and (in particular) finding what we can each learn from those who do not have the same views as our own.

I've gone through so many iterations and redesigns of the application, each one I feel is better than the last (simplified, more useful, and closer to my goal). So, while I am utterly biased, I really feel what I have designed is extremely innovative and (more importantly) desperately needed today. So I finally quit my excellent job to pursue it. Knowing that we didn't have enough funds to create the application and be anywhere close to self sustaining, we decided to market a crowdfunding campaign to get the funds we need.


**My Problem:**

 Turns out (*SURPRISE!*) marketing is even harder than I expected! Everything took so much longer than planned, and the challenges seemed to be never ending. I may just be too analytical for this kind of work, but I wanted to:

* Demonstrate the potential benefits and implications, without exaggerating.
* Explain the research, support and justification for my claims, without losing people with needless details. 
* Capture people's imagination, without being too idealistic

Everything seems to be a balance, and that balance is difficult. 

**My Request:**

So, kind Reddit, after all our work - I was hoping I might be able to request some thoughts or feedback on our presentation and/or the project itself.

1314847950.0,27,self.startups,k0xm5,Practical Advice for Getting Into Y-Combinator,stapleguy4,31,4,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/k0xm5/practical_advice_for_getting_into_ycombinator/,"I just got back from attending [this skillshare class](http://www.skillshare.com/Practical-Advice-for-Getting-Into-Y-Combinator/277599929) called ""Practical Advice for Getting Into Y-Combinator"". It was taught by two guys who are YC alums. I took a few notes and felt like typing them up and summarizing, so here's the gist of the class if anyone is interested and/or thinking about applying to YC.

- There are two main portions of the application, the written part and the interview. If the written part is good, you get asked to interview.

- All YC alums have access to review the written part of applications. When reviewing them, they have access to two buttons: No, and Maybe. YC partners can see statistics on how many No's vs Maybe's an application gets, but they still review all applications themselves. Each partner has to review thousands of applications, so as you can imagine, they can only skim most of them.

WRITING PORTION

- #1 consideration is the team. YC uses your idea as a proxy to see if you are smart. If they like the team enough but not they idea they will fund you anyway, for a different idea.

- Brevity/conciseness is key. Answers should not be more than 120 words. Keep in mind how little time each partner has to review. You need to make each word count. You also need to be sure to answer the question ""What are you building?"". Many people fail to do this. The litmus test should be this - ""If someone read the answer to this question, could they go steal your idea and build it?"". If yes, you've succeeded.

- Helps to ask others to review your application - they are a fresh pair of eyes. Make sure non-technical people can understand it easily.

- No buzzwords/jargon/b.s. Don't try to do a sales pitch, they are immune to that.

- Required video portion of interview: don't read a script. The goal of this is basically to see that you're a normal, decent person who can communicate intelligently. Good idea to include your co-founder in it and the two of you just having an intelligent discussion about your startup.

INTERVIEW PORTION

- Interview only lasts 10 minutes. A timer starts when you walk in the room.

- Be prepared to answer many questions, but most questions will be based on the application. Keep your answers as concise as possible, ideally one sentence.

- Try to convey the following: 1) What are you making, 2) Who is it for, 3) What problem does it solve, and 4) Why are you the right person to make it.

- Be knowledgable of competitors, and able to talk about who your biggest threat is.

- If you have a demo, that helps. Do not make a deck, as there will be no time to present. But if you have a prototype or something that can run locally on your laptop, that can help, and the YC partners will just stand over you and look at what you've got.

- Good way to prep is to ask people you know to poke holes in your idea, and to come up with responses to those holes. That's basically what they will be trying to do.

Overall, determination is the most important characteristic they are looking for. That is even more important than being smart. That's why its important to demonstrate that from other accomplishments - whether it is school, other failures, etc.",,False,,t5_2qh26,False,,,True,t3_k0xm5,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/k0xm5/practical_advice_for_getting_into_ycombinator/,

Newsflash, it doesn't!",ebuchholz,40,11,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/i3qn8/stop_thinking_that_funding_solves_all_problems/,"I'm so tired of this ""I just need to raise a million dollars and I'll be all set!"" bullshit. As a guy who has raised millions in angel and VC cap, and has started multiple companies and products... Let me tell you: Raising money *doesn't fix anything*.

It doesn't make finding a technical cofounder easy. It doesn't make finding a market fit easy. It doesn't make coding easy. It doesn't make scale easy. It doesn't make sales easy. It doesn't make HR easy. It doesn't make accounting easy. It doesn't make your life easy. 

In fact, it makes *everything harder*.

Before you get customers you only have yourself to think about. Once you have customers you have another master. Adding funding just adds *another* master to the mix, and usually, multimillionaires / billionaires are kinda hard to say ""No."" to.

Do yourself a favor. Think of your company as a car, you've got an engine, a transmission, tires, suspension, etc etc. Well, raising money is like putting gasoline into your car.

What's that? You don't actually have a functioning engine? Whoops, it just exploded in your face!

Don't have a steering wheel? Ouch, you just drove off a cliff.

Sounds silly, but the analogy is closer to the truth than you'd think. Savvy investors look for the car that's built well, is on sale, and just needs a tank of gas and a good wax. They want the sure thing, not the great idea. 

While your ""idea"" might be great, it amounts to a drawing of the car's body, leaving about 99% of the car out of the discussion.

Especially when it comes to web-based products, if you can't put together a prototype and get commits from your first few customers, then you're not ready. 

Don't waste your time, or more importantly, an investors time, with ""great ideas"".

Think I'm being harsh and it's not as hard as I say? The reality is that if you're looking for funding before you have revenue, you're looking for a golden ticket, and sorry to tell you bro, Wonka's chocolate factory ain't real.

Basically, it's like a graphical product filter. You know on many sites where there's a side bar where you can filter by price, or specifications? Have you ever wanted to see a scatter graph of the relationship between certain specifications and price, and filter accordingly? Well, maybe not, but I did, so I built a web site to do it.

You start off with a set of items from a given category, select X and Y axes, then delete the stuff you don't want. You then repeat until your shortlist is down to a manageable size. Is the thing you want to compare not on there? just add it to the graph. The back end engine will decide if it wants to add that data to the main database to serve to other people.

At the moment, I've only got data from a few categories, and there are only two available on the site to play with at the moment: android phones, and 3d printers. That's largely because those are things I've wanted to buy recently. Currently I'm creating a dataset for UK politicians, so that I can create a shortlist of the best and worst. 

I know this won't go anywhere without useful data on it. What I'd like to ask the collective wisdom of reddit is: What groups of items would you like to filter?

If you want to steal any of these ideas, feel free. Just make them damn things so I can buy or borrow them.  

**Toilet seats with pedals that lift the seat.**

How the hell has this not been mass produced yet? There was even an 11 year old American kid who invented one in like 2007 and made national news. But we still don't have them, and women are still sitting in piss. Every woman in the world would make the men in her house buy these. Somebody become a billionaire mass producing these, please. I'll do a commercial for free. I'm serious.

It doesn't take a rocket surgeon to invent a toilet pedal, and you don't have to invent a whole new toilet. Just build an attachment that connects to existing toilets. A clan of engineering students could build them in their garage and sell them at frat parties for beer money and sex. Every day millions of people press a pedal at the base of their trash can to lift the lid to throw garbage in. Move that pedal into the bathroom and have it lift the toilet seat. Why aren't the people who make pedal-operated trash cans making money off of this?

**A whole genre of music big enough to warrant its own radio station of techno music played solely by orchestras and designed to facilitate thinking**

This is another no-brainer that has been done before. Moby played with a full orchestra. Metallica played with a full orchestra. It was awesome. There's nothing wrong with listening to regular classical music played by orchestras. Young people just don't. If symphonies would get off their high horse in their ivory tower and stop telling their customers what they're supposed to consider refined music and give them what they want...a lot more musicians would have jobs.

If this kind of music were made under the supervision of professional psychologists, they could make kick ass future-retro techno that caters to creative thinking. This wouldn't just make the people responsible for it a lot of money, but it could potentially make the world smarter.

**Pop music with the words muffled**

I ain't gonna lie. If a Katy Perry song comes on the radio when I'm driving I'm likely to roll up my windows and turn up the volume until I come to a stop light or I'm about to let one of my friends in the car. That music is designed to be hypnotic, and it works on me half the time. The only problem is, listening to Katy Perry and other pop stars drone on about the most banal, anti-intellectual brain rot makes me want to stab my ears with pencils. I'd buy damn near every pop album that came out if the words were sung in a different language that I couldn't understand or they were just electronically altered so the words sound like a raspy ghost (a sweet, sexy, raspy ghost). The only reason I listen to pop music on my headphones anyway is because I'm trying to drown out the sound of how much the city sucks. If everything pop singers say is just white noise anyway, then just give me the white noise without the insultingly stupid dialogue.

**Thick clothing with ambitious technological gadgets sewn into them**

 Technology has reached the point where this is possible. There's no reason we shouldn't all be walking around like Inspector Gadget with retractable propellers in our hats. I should be able to shoot Nerf bullets out of my coat sleeve. Women should be able to shoot mace out of theirs. Everybody loved Data's quircky, wearable gadgets in The Goonies. We would have bought completely impractical Walkman-sized clothing gadgets then, and we're still waiting for an Iphone wrist watch. Shoes have had great success putting zippers, pockets, inflatable soles, lights and wheels into them. Run with that. If you can imagine cools ways to put gadgets onto super heroes, then just think of your customers as super heroes and pimp their clothes accordingly. When I shout, ""PANTS ACTIVATE!"" I want something to happen. I want two-way speakers in my collar and a HUD that flips down from the brim of my hat. I don't care what it does. I don't care if shows me Google Maps or my heart rate. I'll buy one pretty much no matter what. Our pocket books are as deep as your imagination. Someday someone is going to design a motor cycle jacket that, instead of having padding in the back has some kind of electronic gadget the size of a Manta Ray in it. If you're as big as a professional wrestler then you should be really upset. You could sew pounds of inconspicuous gadgets your jacket. I wonder who the first major clothing brand is going to make the Swiss Army Knife of leather jackets and become associated with extra-utilitarian clothing. By rights it should be the Swiss Army Knife company, but... we'll see.

**Sustainable Eco Office Neighborhoods**

The suburbs are unsustainable and inhumane. They're destroying the planet and making us miserable. It's like Jacque Fresco said, ""This shit's got to go."" Hell, Jacque Fresco even drew up all the plans for a sustainable replacement for suburbia. I'm not intimately familiar with his political views, and I don't give a damn what he thinks people would/should behave like in a Utopian society. I just want his damn house. I wish he would spent the millions of dollars he's made off of advertising them on building them by now. And I don't know why everyone else hasn't stolen his ideas and made billions of dollars off them yet either.

I don't even need anything as fancy as The Venus Project. When I was a kid I lived three blocks from the actual projects. The outside of my house doesn't have to sparkle. All I need are sandbag walls, concrete floors, basic utilities  and a green house. If you built one big enough you could put bedrooms and offices in it. Then you wouldn't have to leave your house to get to your office and your grocery store. I guess there are people who wouldn't want to live in that kind of environment, but if the number of drug addicts and Emo kids living in Suburbia is any indication of how frustrating and unfulfilling living in the suburbs is, I'd say it's a moral imperative to try something different. Point in fact, suburbia is unsustainable. It's not a matter of if it will collapse but when. Sooner or later we're going to be forced to try something different. So why not get rich doing the right thing that everybody is waiting to happen... right now? I'd do it myself, but I barely got enough money to build a sandwich.

**Floating island communities**

We have cruise ships, submarines and aircraft carriers that can stay at sea for months at a time and sustain hundreds of crew members. Those are expensive as hell because they're designed to get from Point A to Point B as quickly as possible in as much style as possible. I want to move out to sea and never come back. So I don't need a floating vessel that goes anywhere. And I don't need style. I'm used to austerity, and I think minimalism is aesthetically pleasing anyway. I'll trade all the cannons and chandeliers for a garden. To fulfill my needs the island doesn't need to be anything more than a really, huge floating drum with a garden on the top and an anchor on the bottom. That'd be real easy to make. You could make one out of cement using a cast cheaper than it costs to build a 5 bedroom house. And yes, concrete floats.

Rich people like to live on boats. There'd be an instant market for luxury  floating drum islands. You could even make floating camp grounds and hotel chains to test the market first. And the best part about it is, you don't have to buy land. I don't know why Kim Dotcom isn't hosting MegaUpload in a floating fortress in the middle of the Pacific Ocean or why Pablo Escobar wasn't throwing a permanent Mardi Gras on a massive tract of floating resort islands or why every hotel in Waikiki doesn't sell their property and build twice as many rooms off the coast of Hawaii. Or why the Red Cross isn't building sustainable flotillas for refugees where they can live safely and sustainable while the warlords in their home country figure out what to do after all their farmers leave for greener pastures at sea.

I'm a computer science major, and just got my first internship at a small startup about a month ago.

The company consists of just 3 principles trying to launch their business.  Since being hired I've designed and configured their MailChimp, and am now building their site off previously established mockups, as their developer is no longer able to work on the project.

The principles are pretty computer illiterate and I am pretty much building the entire infrastructure of their web presence.  I recognize that they are at the very beginning stages of their business, and was told this in the interview, but...

I had hoped to be engaged in a learning environment, and I feel as though I am sort of being taken advantage of, and teaching instead of learning.

Is this standard for most internships? Should I look for something else or be grateful I am intimately involved in their business?

What doesn't make it easier is that it is a very exciting concept to work on, and the principles are extremely nice, cool people...

Any advice is greatly appreciated

**Edit:** Wanted to throw an edit in here to first thank the shit out of you guys for the advice and support it's been great.

Also wanted to defend my currently employers(?) to a certain extent.  They are nice, friendly, and smart people with impressive backgrounds.  But as noticed by the community, they are pretty disconnected from the actual process of implementation - even though they have mapped it.  

In thinking this over, I think it will be beneficial to both parties if I decline the web project in a manner where I explain the magnitude of the process in hopes that it gives them a better understanding of how necessary the employment of a professional developer is.

I've been working alone on a startup for the past two years and got some funding (to last two more years). I wrote that I'd hire an engineer into the plan and hired a friend. He's been working with me for about 5 months. From the start he asked me to match his salary at his previous job in marketing (I said no and paid him 90k instead of 110k), he wants stock, got me to buy him a computer, and has taken a couple vacations already.  

I feel like he's been taking more than contributing, and a lot of engineering skills I had thought he had are below mine....so he's not adding too much, its just alleviating some of my work. He also lacks focus and I feel like I need to keep reminding him of things to do. We've talked already about deadlines slipping.  

While the help is appreciated, I think I can sub-contract a lot of stuff out and probably get better quality. I'm not sure what to do here because it is personal. I've been trying really hard to accomodate him...he's been already asking about stock and I have a feeling he's expecting founders share which ain't gonna happen.  

Any advice? I HATE to put him out of a job and was thinking to offer to change his status to a contractor position (with possibly some equity, like 1%). What do people think?

As a result, most of our team works from home and only comes into the office when it's absolutely necessary. The office is mostly empty and it doesn't feel like a place where you can get work done. 

Now we've got some funding behind us and are charging towards the market with significant resources and aggressive timelines, and our diffuse, rag-tag corporate culture isn't cutting it anymore.

Creating cohesion among the team is a top priority for me right now, but I'm not sure what I can do to hurry the process along.

We're looking at new office space, and I think that getting into our own space (we currently share with 2 other companies) will be a great opportunity to institute some changes. For one, our current office is really small and doesn't have defined workspaces for people. Everything feels really temporary. 

In our new office I'm going to make sure that everyone has a defined workspace that's theirs. And that all the furniture is ergonomic and stylish and feels like a cool, modern place to work.

I'm also calling an all-team meeting soon that's mandatory attendance for everyone. I don't think our whole team has ever been in the same room all at the same time (except for the christmas party) and a lot of new people have joined, so I think it's a good way to make sure everyone knows who everyone else is.

Essentially we would team up and come up with ideas for startups - preferably no more than three people to a team (1 programmer, 1 marketer, and 1 designer maybe?) . Once an idea has been found for each team, we design it, code it, and toss it up on our servers for this subreddit to vote on.

Who knows, we might even make a startup that will become the next big thing.

Anyways, let me know what your thoughts/opinions are on this little idea.

Oh, and if we're thinking of teams already, I'm a programmer, marketer, and mediocre designer. :P

**Edit** - It seems like most of you are for this idea. Now we need to decide on the following items:

* Rules
* Are we going to make the startups theme-based (Ex: the theme is ""Winter"" and we choose a startup idea that revolves around anything winter-related).

It is ""seller financed"".

They are an enterprise software vendor, and it just so happens that something I've built over the past few months (with the help of my 3 partners in the project, its a 4-way split) perfectly solves a difficult problem for them.  

Apparently they were on the verge of acquiring another company to do the same thing, but they prefer my solution (this is why they were able to move so quickly).  This, however, means that there is time pressure as they will need to cut the other company loose.

Basically, they don't pay immediately, but the faster they pay the lower the acquisition number (ie. they get a discount for paying quickly).  Its something like $6M if it takes them 3 years to pay, but down to $2M if they can pay within a year (something they said was very unlikely given their current projections, which I've asked to see).

They want me to sign an LoI within a week that will give us 45 days to finalize the deal.

How typical is this deal structure?  Any gotchyas I should watch out for?  Should I try to negotiate on the numbers? (ie. try to go for more than $6M)

Not to be rude, but please don't respond unless you know what you are talking about, I'm perfectly capable of uninformed speculation all by myself ;-)

*Update*: Ok, so after receiving a lot of advice, both here, HN, and IRL, I've started to look at this deal differently.

It's basically a 50:50 rev share with an option to buy within 1 year for $1.5M *where whatever we've received from the rev share counts against the eventual acquisition price*.

Rev share is fine, option to buy is fine, but the last part is what gives me heartburn, it's like we are buying our own software from ourselves and giving it to them.

I'll probably go back with 50:50 rev share with minimums and exclusivity, option to buy for $4M within 3 years, rev share *does not* count against eventual acquisition price.",,False,,t5_2qh26,True,,,True,t3_loylh,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/loylh/need_advice_a_credible_company_just_offered_to/,

I'm interested in hearing your opinions about sales and salespeople. Whether you actively employ them, seek them out, or headhunt. I've browsed this subreddit for a while now but I rarely hear about the war stories from the sales trenches. I'm a salesperson myself and have been a successful one as well. I've sorta found my calling and I'm looking to open my wings a bit.

I find most people in the startup space come in 2 regular flavors. There's the tech guy who couldn't sell let alone close if his life depended on it, and the front office guy, who likes to sit around and spend money hiring people to do things he should be doing himself. Oversimplified, but true in a generalized sense. How do you guys get your products actually sold? Are you relying on the product to sell itself? Have you hired a sales force before? What was your experience with it?

I ask because I'm interesting in furthering my career in the startup space. I find the potential to be staggering. I see a bunch of people developing these incredible products and services only to hit a brick wall. But I see sales as an everyday skill needed in the entrepreneurial headspace, and I find a lot of entrepreneurs lack it.

So, if one was interested in specializing in selling for startups, where would he best be found? And what kind of hurdles/challenges would you have for them? Expectations? What compensation would you realistically offer? 

Thanks for your time

I have done everything myself from designing the product and packaging to finding a manufacturer. I recently found an investor and we are about to go into full scale production. I would like to get some strangers' opinions and you guys seem like the perfect people to ask. 

The product is Flux Headphones. They are high quality in-ear heaphones for the iPhone, iPad or iPod that have small, lightweight magnets embedded along the length of the cable. This allows it to stick to itself so they can be wrapped around your wrist, phone or anything else to prevent a tangles mess.  

My target market is high school kids. For some reason this age loves to wear things around their wrists like rubber bracelets and [those BS holographic things that ""improve balance"".](http://dsp.imageg.net/graphics/product_images/pDSP1-12636381p275w.jpg) They also wear headphones during school and need somewhere to store them during class. We will start with this group but every age can benefit from these headphones. 

We believe that different situations require different headphones so we are also including a second pair in the box without the magnetic cable. This pair is lightweight and perfect for running or can just be stored as a back-up pair while the magnetic headphones are good for people on the go (work, school, etc).

This is what is included in the box: 

* 1 pair of headphones with the magnetic cable
* 1 pair of non-magnetic lightweight headphones
* 3 different sizes of removable silicon earbuds

We are initially producing them in black and white and hopefully expand to other colors in the future.

The magnetic version weighs around 18 grams which is less than [Beats by Dre Earbuds.](http://pisces.bbystatic.com/image2/BestBuy_US/images/products/9492/9492426_ra.jpg;canvasHeight=500;canvasWidth=500) The magnets do not interfere with the sound quality and it poses no danger to the iPhone/iPod. 

Here is the black version:

* http://i.imgur.com/n1JaO.jpg  (ignore the artwork, this is just to show the box)

I still have time to make last minute changes before we start production so what do you guys think? Any suggestions about anything?

[EDIT] 


Thank you all for the feedback it has been very helpful. Some people like it, some do not but that is to be expected. Thanks to you guys we are working on the following things:

1. New name - something catchy with the word magnet or mag somehow incorporated 
2. New logo and package design - Hiring a design firm, will emphasize the magnetic cable and all the uses
3. Black version will be all back, no more white cable
4. No longer including the second pair of headphones
5. Rethink pricing strategy 

As you can see we are changing a lot. It's always good to get strangers opinions because the people around you tend to just tell you what you want to here. Keep posting your thoughts!

We are a small team of 2, and over the past 18 months we have worked our ass off on a product which is supposed to launch very soon. People in this community are familiar with the feeling of keeping the hope up during all those dark days and nights of development, and not giving up to get to this launch point.

Just recently, a giant company (read that top 5) has launched a product which is well over 90% match of what we have been working on. This is indeed shocking for us. It feels like our lives has been 18 months shorter overnight.

Usually, you expect all your hard work to get paid off with the reward of that extra ordinary feeling of getting closer to the launching point. It doesn't matter if your product fails later, at least at the launch point you can keep your hopes up.

Unfortunately, that rewarding point for us has been taken by the giant. Their product is very similar to us, and they already have millions and millions of users. What chance do we have to compete with the giant?

It seems the only way left for us is to have one last git commit with the message of 'goodbye little product'. This feels like killing your own unborn baby.

I'm not expecting a miracle by this post, but I'm giving it a try to see your views on this. Please advice us.


**EDIT**

This turned out to be far more helpful than I could imagine. These comments are not shallow positivist advices, most of them are tips with strong logic which have convinced a pessimistic starter like me. Thank you all.

Many have correctly pointed to the long 18 months 'stealth' mode. This was not exactly an 18 months of secrecy. The problem we were trying to solve was tough, there was no open source solution for it, we had to build our own technology before we build the product on top of it. And this was the fastest we could do with our limited resources. We had an MVP about 9 months ago, and we tested it with some users, going to a second iteration.

My company recently shipped version 1.0 of [Ginger](https://gingerhq.com), a private team collaboration tool with threading (like Reddit, mailing lists, and forums). Ginger is real-time, meaning you see updates as they happen, but threaded so you can fork an idea and run with it without disturbing the flow.

The idea came about when we realized that there were no tools that helped drive good discussion that weren't also hard to use. I won't go tool by tool, but as Reddit users you are probably aware of how good the discussions here can be and how easy they are to follow vs on Facebook, Twitter, Yammer, IM, chat rooms, in person, or in mailing lists.

We've treated this project as a startup the entire time and have learned a lot along the way. The hardest lessons we're learning are around marketing. While we are confident we have a viable product we're having a hard time building traction and making our simple idea click. We want to market, but also want to understand not only our target audience better, but those who have used similar tools (again, like Reddit). We've gotten various bits of feedback so far and could use your help confirming some things.

We aren't asking you to sign up (though that would be great, free trial + demo and all), we're really just interested in what you think:

- What do you think of the overall idea? 
- How's our landing page look?
- Does our pricing seem fair?

I plan on running the space, coming up with events and talks that would benefit the startups, and working on the house project (I'm a web developer).

1321523140.0,23,self.startups,mfj8z,Word of warning; pick your partner's carefully when forming a start up.,OffToABadStart,29,6,32,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/mfj8z/word_of_warning_pick_your_partners_carefully_when/,"In the last month or so I attended a Startup weekend event http://startupweekend.org/. 
 
Someone pitched a totally awesome idea that had immediate possibility to be a real revenue generating startup and I wanted in.  So I approached and said I would provide my professional services in exchange for foundership/equity.  

I invested myself heavily into making the pitcher’s idea real, bringing to life a hastily slapped together proof of concept that was 98% written by me.

We didn’t place high enough to get any accolades due to how quickly I wrote this thing ( some edge cases screwed the pooch) but it was still a viable idea and I really was excited to go back and clean up my habber dash code and make it into a production revenue generating product.

Alas, this is not to be.  After corresponding briefly with the pitcher about next steps their response was (slightly rephrased, but about as long as the original ) “I’ve decided not to proceed.”  I then asked if they would mind if proceeded, leaving a place open for them if they changed their mind later to which they said they would mind and wouldn’t be happy if I stole their idea.

By my estimates, I’ve wasted about 30 seconds of Charlie Sheen winning time.  My options seem fairly clear:

* Litigate for control ( No Zuckerberg lose ends for me )

* Demand compensation

* Slap the AGPLv3 kiss of death on my stillborn code and then publish the mess somewhere quietly

Having a Judge and a Attorney as family members plus a past life doing legal undergraduate classes, I equate litigation to resolving a fender/bender with a tactical nuke.  Sure you might have “won” but you also kind of lost.

I doubt the person in question has the cash to cover my kind of invoices ( min. $85/hour http://imgur.com/aL8Xd  )... so yeah that’s out.

Ultimately it boils down to capstone my code under the most restrictive open source license I can think of, cutting my losses, and then talking mad shit about the pitcher for a couple years until someone new &amp; special fucks me over.

tl;dr  Be careful who you partner with in a startup: make a statement of understanding, unleash the kraken, or cut your losses and walk away.

PS. English is probably a fifth or sixth language for me, somewhere after Javascript at least.   


Edit:

I very much appreciate the good/bad/brutal feedback.  So far to sum up somethings that stood out:

* Just because a partner backs out, doesn't mean the idea is gone as well.  With the right motivation you can start from a new angle and keep trying.

* Yeah it sucks; move on and stop feeling sorry for myself ( no one has said it that brutally but I get the feeling its there between the lines ).

* swombat pointed to an excellent post about not making any assumptions and really talking things out with your partner.  [swombat's linked article](http://danieltenner.com/posts/0005-starting-up-with-a-friend.html).  In reflection this is totally what happened.  I joined the startup weekend with blinders on, focussed only on ""winning"", with the desire to progress into a real startup.   My partner, thinking about his comments, was only there to compete in a game, to socialize, and have a good time.  We never had an opportunity to reconcile this until afterwards.  In reflection I think they probably regret pitching their idea and fear losing control of their baby.

* I am an asshole, fortunately I am aware of this and on the first step of deciding if this is a problem or not.  If I present myself as an asshole I think I am cheating myself in lost opportunities and sometimes more uphill relationships.

* Even talking about Litigation is completely f'ing stupid, unwarranted, and probably makes me look like a Law &amp; Order armchair fanboy judge.


I have to own part of this fiasco, I just went heads down coding and never really paid attention to anything else but getting code out the door.  Sure I guess it could be construed as great to pull the techside of the line, but in the other it seems like I was being selfish and just expecting the rest of the team to figure their own shit out.  Hell a good analogy is that I was playing hungry hungry hippo and trying to own a majority of the code to cement myself into the startup.",,False,,t5_2qh26,True,,,True,t3_mfj8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/mfj8z/word_of_warning_pick_your_partners_carefully_when/,

Last year I was working freelance, and I was commissioned to build a web app. I did, I was paid, we deployed, everything went very smoothly.

My client at the time mentioned that he wanted to give me a 10% equity stake in the business. I'd heard that line before, I said I'd consider it but didn't formally agree to anything.

Since then, I've got a full time job, which I've been doing for the last year. Over the last year, I've also been working on the web app -- I know, terrible idea as a freelancer to work for free, but money hasn't really been a concern for me, and it was a pretty interesting project to keep as a side-project. I probably spent at least 2-3 times as long over the past year working on the site as I did building it in the first place. I don't regret any of this, it's totally fine. I haven't billed for any of this work.

Now, it's come to the stage where he and I are both interested in formalizing a business arrangement / equity partnership; I've invested enough time in the app that I'm convinced it's a worthwhile venture, and he wants to make sure I'm invested in its future.

He's offering me 10%. I think I should be getting at least 30% (I haven't yet replied to his offer). I know I'm not entitled to anything, and I'm not framing this as any kind of legal question -- I just wanted to see what you guys think I should be asking for. At this point, neither of us have any strict obligations, and I'm free to walk away entirely if we don't come to terms. I don't feel I'm owed anything, but I would like more of a stake if I'm going to be investing this much time on top of my day job.

I'd be working as a sole technical cofounder -- basically doing all of the work around building, upgrading, scaling + managing the application. My (potential) partner would be handling the business end.

Am I justified in asking for more? What kind of percentage would you ask for in this situation?

Any advice would be much appreciated!

",quadtodfodder,32,7,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/zb2r2/once_naive_programmer_loses_control_of_product_is/,"**TLDR:  I made a cool photo-web app demo a few years ago, founded a company with some bay area guys from the internet, lost all the IP, and was fired from the company with a few bucks and a few points of stock.  Would as soon my next moves were not as naive as the ones that got me here.**

Hey people, perhaps some of you have caught my grumpy tale of woe in the past.  Today I explicitly ask you guys what you think I should do.

The long version:
A few years ago I made a cool photo browsing UI based on the flickr API.  A guy I met at the NYTech Meetup introduced me to some people, one of whom got pretty excited about the project.  For about two years this guy and his friend (marin county types) tried to sell one-off versions of the code to assorted clients and we all saw a trickle of money relating to the product.

Eventually they actually started looking for money on the project.  During this time we expanded the product to accept images from any api, and made some other improvements.  Around then we signed an MOU basically saying that the two of them, me, and another programmer who they had introduced me to would form a company at a 25% split four ways (dumb move #1, I believe).

We eventually found some money and I moved to marin to work on the thing for a few months (turned out to be about 8 months).  Without going into a lot of detail, it was rather hellish, I realized that the rest of the team considered me baggage and was not about to actually let me drive development of the product.  I was pressured to sign away the IP and signed out patent as a co-creator (dumb move #2 - ""we can't get more money if the company doesn't have all the IP"").  Our founding papers did not have a board seat for me, and I was an at will employee ( dumb move #3 - ""how can they fire me?  I made the thing!"" ).  I none the less did the vast majority of dev work and enjoyed my (by my art school standards) giant paycheck.  I was allowed no investor contact, though finagled some anyway.

Months later, on the third start-over of the project, I mention to the CEO that I had started an ""auto-pornographic"" web site in my free time, which also had a cool photo viewing UI (pornopticon.com - ""be the porn you want to see in the world!"" , if you're interested).  I was immediately fired for ""stealing code"" and going into business against the company.  Whether or not this is legitimate (I say ""not at fucking all""), California allows for no fault dismissals, and I was told to hit the road.  My unvested shares were bought out eventually and I hold about 1.5% of the company.

They recently closed their ""seed round"" and are doing an A round now.

Recently I got in touch with the CEO and asked if I could be at least regarded in company material as the creator of the product.  He explained to me that he had actually come up with the ideas in the product and that I was simply doing his coding work for him.  This caused me...fury.  Indeed this is why I'm finally saying fuck it, and going to the people.

- Pornopticon.com was deved on my own machine on my own time
- The products *do* have some similarities, to be fair.
- I did not file the patent on my own, it was filed as four creators.
- For a while I was told that I would be sued if I did anything with ""movable, sortable photo tiles"".  There is still the vague threat that they will sue me if my project ever takes off.
- There was a two month period (after the first investment) where I worked for free, and was told I would receive compensation or stock - later on, I was told that the CEO and investor had no recollection of this agreement, and that I worked for free because the project was behind.
- My lawyer-second-cousin suggested suing them for intentionally planning  for the company, fire me, and take the IP.
- He also suggested finding a lawyer who would do some contingency work, or a free consultation to determine how I could hassle the company.
- I have though of going on a publicity campaign of some sort, along the lines of ""hey naive art school kid who can program - don't be like me!""
- My lovely ex GF suggests that these people are a bunch of assholes, I have my stock and my little cash pile, drop the whole thing and make the next great thing.
- I am always torn because they have far better investor contacts, and, well, I want them.

Or if they have a certain aspect of their business they want to know more about, they make a detailed self post explaining their situation and then seek the advice of their peers.

But I would be a shitty entrepreneur if I made assumptions about my target demographic. So let's do a little customer discovery to figure out where people want to take this subreddit.

I'll post topics as comments and people can upvote the ones they like. Comment on those for further discussion. It is more of a survey than customer discovery but it should provide some good insight.

",socialplex,33,10,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/usd64/i_didnt_know_this_but_there_are_some_really/,"I was told by a redditor that my page sucked and to look into wordpress. I had before but found that the wordpress themes that are stardard are really terrible.

So I did a bit of searching after being encouraged to buy some or something.

I found a theme builder online. You can Google ""WordPress theme generator"" and find some pretty decent ones. Then I found some good ones on theme forrest because of  blog I found. I tend to search for things like ""best WordPress themes"" at which point google adds the current year and I end up getting really good information.

So even though I just gave out some very helpful information I have more. Oh dear God do I have more.

So I was told about a theme builder called visual composer. It looks pretty awesome. It allows you to do a lot of neat things within a theme. It doesn't build the theme but it allows you to modify the contents of it with a lot of really neat widgets like sliders, expendables, accordion, etc.

Then on the blog I had found I found a theme called ""karma"" and boy is it wonderful. It's cheap too. for 40 bucks you get an insane amount of stuff with it. Looks very very professional. For 40 bucks there is no way I could get anyone to build anything close to looking that good. It is on theme forrest as well.

Also, the company that owns theme forrest has other huge depositories that host other media types for making stuff. Audio, video, icons, etc. Just wonderful.

Just wanted to share these things. Let's talk about resources below. Help each other out on the websites thing.

I show up the next day and they explain that the job was to put sample content on the website. I spend the next few hours hacking an interface into their back office and creating a database of content from the web to upload. At the end of the day, I explain that I can automate the process and instead of it taking two people two weeks, I can have it done in a couple of days.

The CEO was impressed even though the solution seemed rather obvious. I finish the job and I start helping them out with other things. I rewrite their terrible English and Spanish copy, write up a basic marketing strategy and give feedback on the website. I start understanding the business model and to see its potential. I'm also duly impressed by their big name partners but notice the CEO knows next to nothing about computers or the Internet.

So a week before leaving, I ask the CEO if he's looking to hire. I tell him that they need someone like me who has startup experience, having worked at a few already and owning equity in all of them. He tells me that all they're looking for is interns, so I tell him that I understand given that the website is about to launch and that I was willing to accept a short ""internship"", maybe some stock options and a basic stipend to pay for my expenses. He agrees and says he'll draw up a contract.

So I start work, seven days a week. I work during my vacation, developing new partners and searching for marketing firms. He showers me with compliments and sends out an email to his partners and investors saying I am the new Marketing Manager. Awesome I think.

I get back and keep the same pace. I'm work every day until 10-11pm. I review operations completely and keep developing the partner network. Mid-March, I get bumped to Director of Business Development. I start getting results, but negotiations promise to take months.

End of March, the CEO announces there is no more money, out of nearly a million Swiss francs initial investment two years ago, and that salaries would not be paid. People quit, leaving just the CEO, his assistant and me. At this point, I am managing most the operational aspects of the firm while they look for funding. I never get a contract, not even an NDA.

Potential investors come and go, but nobody invests. Our developers and some service providers start freezing our accounts, but we continue more or less getting by operationally. I spend hours everyday in emergency meetings. Late May, the CEO cedes 1% of the company to me, but still no salaries. He starts complaining of having no money. Morale continues dropping.

End of June arrives and there's still no funding, so I inform the CEO and the Board that I am leaving. I explain that my savings have been used up and I have no other choice, even if I am a shareholder. A Rolls-Royce driving board member/investor advances my back salaries and a few thousand more for operations at the last moment though and my financial situation now stabilized, I continue working.

To cut costs, we leave our offices and start working from home. He fires the assistant. I am now the only employee aside from the CEO. He continually complains of being broke, accusing me of having money saved up and even hinting to me and the board that he's going to kill himself. He seems less and less stable. I continue working.

Then last Wednesday, I get a CCed email from him to the board, accusing me of working on the side and no longer being implicated in the company. I instantly deny it, explaining I'm still working nearly 12 hours a day. I show them the results. I go for a walk to calm down and when I get back he's left a message on my phone repeating his accusation and a couple of emails threatening to quit. The emails continue into the next day.

I send out an email the next day stating I can't work in these conditions and that I am stopping my current collaboration immediately. I offer to continue working if they can propose a reasonable a mandate with a minimal budget and well-defined scope.

That was last week. So far nothing but silence. I have no clue what's going on and I don't really care anymore. A real shame. I think it is the first startup I've worked for that is not gonna make it. I just wish I had been hired a year ago, back when they had money, when saving it would have been possible.

So, any other startup nightmare stories? :)

**TL;DR** Worked my way up from temp to employee #1 in startup that had nearly a million Swiss francs in initial investment and worldwide partners in six months. CEO mismanaged capital, went batshit crazy and I left.

So in other words, with minimal time and resources and expertise, this idea can generate a lot of cash.
Now given time, I think I will be able to build up increasing complex algorithms to improve upon the process to such a degree that I will have a good amount of defensibility for the longer-term.

At this early stage of the game, I would like to get as much feedback about my idea as possible (I've already told about 7 people and almost all thought it was a good-to-great idea, many of them have already given me token investments as a sign of confidence and one volunteered to code for me too) but if my idea is even half as clever as I think it is, if enough people hear about it someone is likely to give it a try for themselves because it is such a simple money-maker.

(I'm also ADHD and full of ideas, usually starting multiple sentences at once - please, bear with me.)

I am a 24 yr old dreamer from a large, very poor family in a small ho-dunk town in Florida, who has spent the last 7 yrs of her life basically working in the same call center before being laid off due to outsourcing in the middle of last year (2012). Since I was old enough to hold a crayon, I have been drawing/creating/dreaming up things. I have quite a niche for seeing things other people can't see, and bringing out the treasure in what would otherwise be seen as trash. (I'm horrible at articulating what I'm trying to say though, as you can probably tell...) While I excelled in my job at the call center, being promoted to a Supervisor position within the first 6 months, I was also absolutely miserable with my life and the lack of creation involved in the work. I eventually developed extreme anxiety issues, and came to realize that life wasn't worth living if you were doing something you hate doing. But, I stuck it out anyway since this was basically the only job available in my small town that didn't involve a name tag and a greasy apron. Being laid off was probably the best thing that could have happened to me. After a short stint being a house parent in another town for displaced/ juvenile delinquents, I decided to try to make money off of my creative abilities.

(I'm not sure if this is the best place to start a new paragraph, but the other one was getting large - so yeah...) I started by picking up furniture off the side of the road, and spending very little money out of pocket, fixing it up for my siblings as gifts, and using the photos as a portfolio for my possible business. After posting a few things I'd done for free, I slowly got messages from people who wanted me to do things for them, and was able to make a little money. When I say little, I mean people in this town basically wanted me to work for free. I'm never sure how much to charge for things, rather then the basic ""supplies"", but even then I was confused. Do I charge for brushes I already have? What about paint I already have? Its in my supplies but its using up my inventory... For example, I painted a firetruck dresser for a lady for $50, she provided the dresser, but asked I take care of paint/supplies/ect, which I thought would be ok, but I realized at the end of the week that after buying what I needed I was down $30, and since the dresser took about 15 hours of actual labor - I wasn't being paid very much per hour with the $20 revenue I would have made. So that was a lesson learned, but other things became harder - I wanted to work for people, but I had to constantly turn down jobs because my fiance at the time was becoming understandably upset at the amount of time/money I was losing for this dream I had.

Flash forward to today, I'm now living in Wisconsin, away from everyone I've ever known, with my new boyfriend in a small apartment. I've been up here for 7 months now, and have decided to give it one more shot at getting started in some sort of business before I go back to a dreaded life of call center hell. I've created a Facebook page, shared as much as possible, advertised on craigslist, and printed up flyers and advertised at all the local community bulletins. Unfortunately, I haven't gotten any responses. I think mainly it's because I'm not sure what to advertise, I don't even know what to call what I like to do... I've basically been calling it ""Carrie Confetti: Creative Mind for Hire"". Maybe it's because up here in the north my work isn't really as good as people think it is in the back roads town in Florida that I'm from. I honestly have no idea, but I'd love to hear some suggestions. Please, be as brutal as you need - if you think I should give up, and that my work is crappy, please tell me. I am open to all constructive criticism, I want to make this work.

What's in it for you: free market research that I think you'll find insanely valuable.

What's in it for me:  building my portfolio.  I will ""own"" the market research, and be able to show it to people (if I uncover anything you really think needs to be secret for your company I won't publish it).

I'm probably only going to do 1 or 2 of the better ideas that are posted.  Interested?  Answer the following questions:

1 - Describe what you do
2 - Describe who you think your competition is (if you know that)
3 - Describe what your differentiator is
4 - Do you have a target market thought out?  If you do what is it?
5 - Do you have anything built now or a website?


After I do the research I'll link you to the results that I come up with and ask you questions about the value you found in the results.  I will post the results I do to reddit.

**EDIT**: thanks for the feedback everyone.  I'm going to do research about the toiletry subscription service, I'll post what I come up with here.  Everyone's responses have been helpful!

The Blurb:
MixeeLabs a platform for 3d printing web apps. We enable designers and developers to make 3d printing web apps using Javascript. These apps are interactive, with real time feedback in 3d. We take care of the rendering, shopping cart, and plug into Shapeways for production. 

We wanted to do a modeler's platform, where people can upload 3d files and use that as a base template, but we thought it'd make sense to launch narrowly sooner rather than later. 

Some background: 
3d printing is a hot thing in tech right now. And a big problem a lot of people are tackling is how to get people to generate content for 3d printing. Modeling in CAD is a pain. My approach is through making web apps, products that you can tweak and order in-browser. It cuts down on (a) learning how to model and (b) buying and fiddling with a home 3d printer.

(Disclaimer: I'm in my last year of law school and myself and two classmates started a company that specializes in informing MMA startups about the costs and procedures for FDA regulation. This isn't a pitch for my company just some advice for MMA startups. I'm also using a throwaway because I don't want my company attached to my reddit account.)

Sorry for the essay but I think this is very important for any MMA startup.

I just want to impart some advice for anybody either starting a mobile medical application or looking to start one soon. I have a feeling there might be some of you on this sub because this market is **exploding**. Last year Kalorama Information [published a report](http://www.ihealthbeat.org/articles/2012/6/13/report-mobile-medical-app-market-expected-to-grow-by-25-annually.aspx) predicting a yearly growth rate of 23%. VC's are [clamoring to pick up MMA companies](http://www.mobileworldlive.com/vc-funding-in-health-it-shoots-up) with a 2013 Q1 total of $493 million raised versus $236 million in Q1 2012. With that said there is one **massive** barrier to entry into this market: the FDA.

The capital barrier is relatively small for the MMA market. As such, the market has a lot of great ideas and products that are created with small teams that do not have a lot of resources to get FDA guidance. If you are one of these startups, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE do not discount future FDA costs for more immediate capital generating business practices. The device approval process is cumbersome and confusing and requires you to plan from the very beginning. Your development process and marketing plan will be dictated by the FDA. Almost everything you do in the beginning, middle, and end stages of your company will be determined by FDA standards.

From my talks with VC's, one thing that they would really like to see (and can really boost your pitch) is a plan for dealing with the FDA in your business plan and showcasing that you have built in the costs to future revenue and cost projections. In fact, from the startup conferences I've been to where they showcase MMAs and some get funding, every single one that received funding either was in the process of getting FDA approval or mentioned what their FDA plans were.

There are some alternatives if you are a company that is strapped for cash and can't afford to hire a big law firm to help you with your regulatory strategy. First, I would look into joining an MMA incubator like [StartUp Health](http://www.startuphealth.com/), that can give you access to all sorts of startup help including regulatory planning. There are also smaller companies that can give you an overview of the process and the costs without the legal overhead as well. If that's not your cup of tea then the other solution is to do the research yourself, the FDA 513 process can help but don't rely solely on it. Be weary that the rules for what an MMA is and is not are not defined yet, but knowing the process, especially the 510(k) and NSE standards, and the costs and risks associated with that will help you build those into your business plan. You just have to make sure to do your due diligence and make sure you are making the correct projections.

The worst case scenario is that you don't get FDA approved because you did not follow the process, or you do not have enough money to actually complete the application and thus you can't market your product. Another risk of not planning is a delay in being able to go to market because the FDA is requiring you to submit an IDE. If you did not plan or prepare for this possibility you might be without a product for 9-12 months thus no revenue.  These problems are actually quite common. 

I want to see the market succeed. I think that MMAs have a lot of potential to help a lot of people and right now is just the beginning of the market growth. I do not want to see the FDA stifle innovation and force companies out of the market, which they tend to not think of when passing regulations. 

For more information you can check out an article I wrote on how startups should plan for FDA. You can read it [here](http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2012/10/24/a-coming-storm-fda-regulation-of-mobile-medical-applications/#more-53682)

**TL;DR: So if you take one thing away from this it should be that planning for FDA regulation is probably the most important issue to handle as soon as you can as it determines everything from business and marketing strategies, receiving funding, and whether or not you actually have a product to market. If you cannot afford to hire a law firm to determine your regulatory strategy then look to the other options but DO NOT discount future FDA costs. It will come back to hurt you.**",,False,,t5_2qh26,False,,,True,t3_1dtvhg,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1dtvhg/important_information_for_any_mobile_medical/,

I contacted BosiDNA and requested my opt-in records (IP/timestamp) and in their reply they indicated they obtained my address from cofounderslab.  Now this is quite bothersome because on the cofounderslab sign-up page it explicitly states the following:

**""We promise not to share your email with anyone else.""**

The scam seems to work like this.  At some point a few weeks ago I received a private message/e-mail on cofounders lab with the subject ""You received a request from ___ on CoFoundersLab""

And inside the email it stated ""___ wants to know what type of entrepreneur you are! They've requested that you take the entrepreneurial archetype assessment. It's only 10 questions and it's free! Here's what to do:

* Sign in to your CoFoundersLab account
* Click ""My Profile"" (under your name in the top right)
* Click the ""Take Assessment"" button on your profile (on the right side of your profile)

I followed the link just to see what it was about but decided not to complete this assessment.  More importantly, I never opted-in to being added to anyone's mailing list nor did I ever give permission for CoFoundersLab to share my contact info with a third-party.

This seems like a pretty shady business practice to me, has anyone else been getting spam that can be traced back to CoFoundersLab?

Our new webapp uses an existing 3rd party API, which allows us to make single transactions using a credit card.  The API does not allow us to store credit card information, so users would have to enter credit card information every time they want to place an order.  I would like this information to be stored remotely so that users don't have to re-enter a credit card each time.  Whichever service stores the card info would transmit the card info to the 3rd party API to complete the transaction.

I understand PCI compliance, and I know that we don't want that information moving across our servers.  I would like the credit card info to go directly from whatever service stores it directly to the 3rd party API without hitting our servers at all.  

Is there any way to do this?  Braintree, Stripe, etc. all return only 4 digits of CC info, which makes sense.  Is my use case far too rare to have an existing solution?  Thanks in advance.

Initially, when we posted, we were looking for some feedback on our project management system and got a lot of great responses that helped us shape the system to where it currently is.

A few things we added:
	
	App
	- Interactive Gantt chart system for sheduling and planning for projects
	- Simple client management, sortable projects by client, reports for clients
	- Task notifications in-app (file uploads, comments, status changes to tasks)
	- Project Templates (really, you just create a master project and then ""duplicate"" that project with all the users, description, etc. already prefilled. It's real easy)

	Marketing Site
	- Support section
	- Blog
	- More screenshots demonstrating what the app looks like and does on the marketing site
	- Better organization of content

	
There are a number of features we're going to be adding, but these are the main highlights. Other than these, there have been a number of technical optimizations to make it run faster, as well as some design improvements on layout, user experience, etc.

it’s a long read, but here are some excerpts:

----------------

*“You guys, we want to be the big kids on the block. You all have to make this your life, really get into it, even when you’re at home. That’s the way the business world works today, you have to live and breathe these things. For example the Klout thing, our Klout score, we live and die by our Klout score. These things are important! This is what we show our investors!”*

-----------------

*Steven is busy finding them a new live-in “office”. It is not clear where exactly the priorities lie here, office space or living space. There is a lot of talk about 3 bedrooms, bathrooms and great neighbourhoods. Bob refuses to share a bedroom with Steven. They ponder DUMBO, where Steven used to have an office, but dismiss it as “too off the beaten path” and “lacking amenities”.*

-----------------

*Bob tells me for the 100th time “Did you know that we have 3500 beta testers? It’s amazing!” Bob says “if we only get 5 million beta testers we can sell this company for 5 million dollars in a month.” I’m amazed.*

be careful out there kids! it's amazing how many people think a tech start-up is just ""sign up x amount of people, sell to Facebook - voilà, you're rich!""

Me and three of my co-workers (at a large tech company) have been working on a startup website for the past couple months.  We meet every Monday to discuss what we've done, what we're going to do, work through issues, etc.

In the time we've been working, I've noticed that the #1 most common issue is that all four of us have full time jobs doing very thought intensive work (programming, etc), and we all have a hard time coming home and putting in even more programming time on the project.  Most of our work is done on the weekends, when we can dedicate whole days to it.  I haven't had a day off in three months (not that I'm complaining, I'm excited about the project so it keeps me going).

The problem is that progress is inevitably slow.  I keep thinking that if this project was our only priority, we'd be done and launched by now.  If I quit my job I'd be evicted in a couple months at best, I simply have no savings.  How do we deal with a full time job and a demanding workload on another project?  How can I motivate my partners (I'm the CEO) to try to push harder during the week and not just on the weekends?

The further I get into this and the closer we get to beta the more I realize that the workload will only grow as time goes on.  Is it even possible to launch a startup while keeping a full time job?

We do custom design&amp;builds for the HVAC and plumbing markets. The mean bid size of our jobs is about $2M per job. We're a medium sized fish, so to speak. The first week that I was here, one of the partners asked me to create a spreadsheet to help track the items that were 'surplus' in the warehouse. See, after every single job, contractors get stuck with extra crap - tools, parts, specialty items... but as long as they get paid for the job and it didn't affect profit margins, they don't really care. They put it in the warehouse. Once a year, they throw a bunch of this shit away - and they NEVER call it inventory because that would mean that they'd have to declare taxes on it. It's 'excess' pipe, valves, fittings, cranes, tools, whatever.  &lt;--- PROBLEM

So this partner had me inventory everything and create a spreadsheet. He said, ""I want to send this out to everyone else that we've competed against and see if they want anything off the list - we'll sell these items to them for pennies on the dollar, just to get this off our hands."" The more we talked about it, the more we realized that this could ultimately be a website where contractors could add their own inventory / parts, and then contact each other to work out bartering, exchanging, selling, and shipping themselves. It would just help facilitate the transfer of excess capacity between non-competitive contractors. &lt;--- SOLUTION

I talked to everyone that I worked with - they all said that every contractor they've ever known has this problem (every company they've ever worked with, and that the 'web app solution' would be incredible. Craigslist doesn't work for weird, expensive plumbing items because it's too general a marketplace for purchasing agents to check, and eBay doesn't work because it's too time-sensitive.

Then we got busy, and everyone thought it dropped off my radar, but secretly, I was building this thing over my lunch breaks, and while my wife had morning/evening sickness with our pregnancy.

Bootstrap, Rails, PostgreSQL, Mandrill (for email), on Heroku. Whole project took me a few weeks of an hour here, an hour there, and a fair amount of learning basic rails from the ground up from free tutorials (and the very helpful people at Stack Overflow). This is my first major project, and I did 100% of the coding for it.

If you have time, I'd be curious what you think would be some low-hanging-fruit in terms of design or experience mods.

One startup was around just as the 1st bubble burst, a very slow boiler.

The next was self built, it was going really well but I (stupidly) agreed to the decision to focus on being a contractor as I got paid more money.

The third was some time later, I had moved to the US and worked in a financial services startup.

Finally, the fourth was a European startup that the CEO somehow convinced me to be part of. I am very lucky for that opportunity!

In the first I learned that sometimes timing is everything.

In the second I learned that you can't do everything on your own, investment really helps.

In the third I learned that ideas and perspiration are not worth a thing.

And in the fourth I learned that the people you meet along your journey can help you reach greater heights than what you would've on your own.

The point of this whole rant is to say that I have earned way more money by simply being a contractor/full-time employee, but in-between jobs I have been able to get involved into some great startups and take short-term risks and see if they result in something.

To all entrepreneurs out there I highly recommend you try a hybrid approach of being a job nomad AND a continual startup founder.

I hope by startup #5 I will have both investment, a team a revenue model and a product to help me see my own success.

**tl;dr;** I alternate between fulltime/contracting and founding startups, with each iteration I make new contacts and learn new things, eventually - I hope - I too will make my own fortune.

One thing in common with all of them is that niche bloggers (my apps are for little children) never rated me below 4/5, and I get high average scores on the stores.

Here are the scores when I counted last time to write a traction document for investors (this was around late december):

Christmas Snow Globe - 30 ratings - 4.96/5

Magical Music Box Lite - 58 ratings - 4.60/5

Magical Music Box - 38 ratings - 4.86/5

Matryoshka! - 92 ratings - 4.76/5

Nono in Amazonia Beta - 21 ratings - 4.80/5 (android only)


When I search similar apps on the stores, usually my apps are the highest rated ones of the list.


But I am not getting really interesting download amounts, except on launch on iOS (when they show on the ""new"" list, that is ordered by launch date), so I am wondering:

The apps have no downloads because my marketing is bad?

or

The apps have no downloads because they are TOO niche and strange?

Note that except for the paid version of ""music box"", all apps are free, and have no ads and no iap on them (actually, not even cross-promotion of my own apps, I am now considering this a mistake).


EDIT: I don't do astroturfing in the ratings for most part (sometimes there are like 5 ratings at most that are from family and co-workers), because I am very scared that I might get banned from the store (both apple and google, but specially apple, are getting increasingly agressive in nuking astroturfing, in case of apple banning your entire company from the store).

I have experience in retail technology sales which I enjoyed but the thought of making money for someone else when I could concentrate my efforts on making money for myself and cultivating skills throughout has brought me to a stage of wanting to learn alot about technology and sales and ultimately startups. I've decided to learn how to program, self taught for now since I don't see the need for school to learn it. I do appreciate the community aspect of school where you can collaborate on projects but am focusing on cultivating skills to bring value to any project I wish to jump into. I'm extremely interested in futurology and ideas in the transhumanism community and one day hope to be at the front end of human enhancement.

Long post short, what skills do you recommend me cultivating throughout the next few years in an attempt to have a form grasp of the intertwined world of technology and business? My goal is to one day have financial freedom so I can concentrate on large projects that may have impact humanity (Transhumanism, Cyborg communities).

I've been reading this: [CS183 Notes](http://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup) and alot of stuff you guys have said is in there which is reassuring. A piece of advice Peter Theil gives is become the person who discovers great ideas, which I take as being able to learn about different material as well as being able to notice when something is missing and being able to fill the gap. I'll be using my time to cultivate new skills that will help me take action to ""fill the gap"" instead of just having ideas as well as manifesting my ideas in reality in some shape or form and dealing with the user/customer aspect of business.

1355524795.0,21,self.startups,14v732,I am budgeting for my APP company start up and I am having difficulty understanding the Ad revenue system.  Can anyone explain this to me simply?,byerover,24,3,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/14v732/i_am_budgeting_for_my_app_company_start_up_and_i/,"I have been going in circles with my research trying to figure this out and I would greatly appreciate any help!!!

I have an APP concept that I plan to monetize through in APP advertisements mostly.  I am aware of the other methods/combinations for monetizing, but I am unclear on how to calculate projections for Ad revenue. 

From what I understand, Google and Apple with provide apps for your APP but they will take 30% of all revenue you receive from them.  There are other services out there that offer different revenue share rates, etc.  

So to calculate revenue I would do so based on the amount of impressions per month and the CPM value.  I may have this wrong, but CPM/CPI and CTR is the value of your adds per click through or impression.  IE if your ad space has a $5 CPM, then advertisers must pay $5 for every 1000 impressions of their add on your site.  


To calculate the amount of impressions/month: I planned on doing this based on estimating how many users out of the total who have my APP use the app each day and how many impressions and click throughs they provide. 
 [Off the top of my head Ex: An estimated 45% of the total users will use the app once per day,  5% will use it twice a day, 20% will use it 3 times a week, and 10% will use it once a week and the remaining 20% users will use it 1-2 a month.  On Average each user will provide 2 impressions each time they use the APP.  So if I have 100,000 users and that remains constant, I can expect 100,000(.45(30)+.05(60)+.2(3*4.34)+.1(4.34)+.2(1.5))=1,983,800 Impressions per month.]  

Where I am having trouble is finding out how to calculate the CPM value.  Is it something like X impressions a month times $1/(Y amount of impressions)?  What about for click throughs?

If I knew how to do this, I could project estimates of revenue in the future should I reach a certain amount of users, which would then allow me to budget for overhead and marketing expenses to see if based off of marketing reach projections it is even possible to stay in business.  

I don't know if I am off on all of this or not, but I could really use some help with this.  

EDIT:  Thanks everyone for the input.  It seems that the general consensus is that CPM's are low, less than $1, unless I make the most popular APP ever.  I will keep this in mind while doing my forecasting, as well as provide some sort of disclaimer with investors about the unpredictability of not only AD Revenue, but the APP market in general.  

Another questions though.  Using instagram as an example.  Instagram had no revenue, from what I can tell before selling to facebook.  Facebook valued them at about $30/user.  That value was for Facebook, another company would have evaluated them much lower.  They were so valuable to facebook because a lot of instagram users were not on FB yet, so acquiring their 33 million users and combining the services would increase Facebooks exposure by 33 million, while their normal Facebook users were, at the time, valued at $100/user.  So to them, they were getting new users at a fraction of their value.  Plus, Instagram hadn't been marketing very aggressively at that point, so if Facebook didn't act then and Instagram started getting REALLY big that same deal wouldn't have been as easy to accomplish.  Especially since Facebook had a pending IPO launch and limited cash on hand.  Up until that point, Instagram had been funded by angel investors reaching into the millions, starting with an initial investment of $500K that they used for development!  If instagram didn't have any Advertisement, download purchase, in APP purchase, or subscription revenue, then:

A) How were they valued at $30 per user?  
B) Why were investors still pumping money in and evaluating the company in the millions?  

Is it because of potential value for the future since they had such aggressive growth early on?  I have my theories but would like to hear others on that.

I would appreciate any feedback - one question I have is that the app can run truly ad hoc projects (just create a project and add whatever tasks or milestones you want) - but I think its strength is in processes (basically just projects that repeat with the same tasks and milestones). I currently emphasize this ""process"" angle -but I feel that site visitors will not sign up if they just want to manage projects.
Does anyone have advice on how I could address both aspects of the app? The current app summary is: process tracking simplified - but it really is project management and process tracking simplified - which seems a bit too much to write... 

Let me know what you think!

Here is a piece of the conversation that caused the breakdown...names changed, conversation abbreviated.  The topic was giving 25% control to an angel for a ~$100k investment...beyond the fact that he jumped to some major conclusions about what that meant, his entire approach started this on the wrong foot.

I know I probably could have been more tactful; I know picking up the phone or a face to face would be the best way; however I think I have a right to expect professionalism, and this is not the first time I have brought this up.

Here is the deal. With a friend of mine, just out of the university, our plan is to build a startup.

We're building the prototype right now, until we have something decent enough to show potential customers/investors.

I'm not the biggest extrovert, and I've heard it's all about networking. So I'm participating in some local startup events. And I have this feeling that lots of people are bullshiting, acting like they know, give business advice as if they understand the whole situation etc.

I'm a a programmer and a bit of an introvert, so my philosophy until now has always been : build quality stuff, don't bullshit. So I'm wondering if I should change my attitude and become overconfident when talking to other people about my project. I've seen it working.

Also, I'm kind of confused about the whole ""networking"" thing. I understand perfectly the importance of human relationships in business, but I've seen friends doing ""networking"" ( ie go talk to strangers at business events, talk friendly, exchange business cards etc. ) and I'm skeptical wether it's really useful ( to me it's kinda like people who have 2000 Facebook friends ). Does anyone feel similar or am I doing it wrong ?

Anyways, I'm basically a super newbie in the business side of tech startups, and these are the reflections that I have. Does anyone feel the same way ?

I know it was a mistake, but me and some friends got involved in a project without properly forming a partnership. Recently some investors are interested in the project but want us to form an official company. 

The problem is we've noticed that some of our members are pretty laid back or not pro-active in helping the group and we're worried that if we do form a company together, it will just be the few of us pulling the weight. 

Adding onto that, the name of these members are already written on the project (we applied for grants) so it's not possible to just drop them without losing the project as a whole.

How do we form an agreement that can prevent this or would allow us to review or kick out a member if they really do not perform? 

We're not business people so we have no idea how to approach this issue. Anyone has pointers for us?

Thanks in advance!

Over the course of about 9 months I've built up an amazing team based in London of nearly 20 freelancers to deliver the web element of the project. 

The project has been pretty big in scope (thus all the people) and not only covered building a responsive media focused site, custom CMS and the infrastructure it runs on but also the business and product strategy, publishing workflow, marketing and content creation.

But like all good things, the project (from our pov) is coming to an end. The client wants us to transition the product into their team and we'll be finishing up about August. We as a collective group of freelancers have really enjoyed working together and we'd love to keep doing that. 

The obvious answer is to go out and pitch for more work as a digital agency or a professional services firm, however with the range of skills and the size I doubt we'd be able to find that much work that quickly to sustain a long term business nor is anyone a sales person. 

Another option would be to create an online start-up, however we don't have an idea for a business. I've seen start-up advice that suggests creating an great team first and worry about the idea/product/business later - but I don't think that's a great strategy particular when some of us have wives, husbands, mortgages and/or kids to worry about. 

I realize this is not the typical problem to have (e.g. I've an idea and no team) and we're looking for advice as to what to do next.

Currently, the backend codebase is in PHP running on Linux with MySQL. Due to a pivot (a change in the business plan), the codebase has a lot of technical debt due to changing requirements. 
    

The startup is small. The problem is not a big data issue. Also it does not have to scale to hundreds of thousands of users, just thousands of interactive users.


Currently, 1 member of the team (of 2 developers) wants to code all new functionality in Python and over time, dump the PHP. The other member has no strong opinion.
    

The reasonable options to me for backend languages are:
    

* PHP - as it is now
* node.js (JavaScript)
* Ruby
* Python
* Java
     

My own bias is, while PHP is unsexy, it makes sense to invest the time into the existing platform and fix it. Without a high transaction requirement or huge scalability requirement, I can't see a need to move away from PHP. Also, adding a new technology without any clear advantage, seems to increase the teams required skills with no benefit, which seems a poor decision.


Given our situation, I'd love to hear which language you would pick and why.

I'd like to present my new little side project called Packmule.

Packmule connects people wanting stuff delivered (local or global) with travellers making the same journey. Our aim is to disrupt traditional shipping and to encourage P2P shipping of basically anything you could carry in a suitcase, backpack, or the back of your truck. Legal stuff only of course.

Anyone can get or send stuff anywhere in the world, to themselves or anyone else, as long as someone is going there from where your item is originating. Name your payment and hand-pick your delivery person based on reviews, feedback and as much transparent trust information as we can build in. As a traveller, you could possibly make some cash on your next trip.

You can also discover what others are delivering from anywhere in the world. So, if you've ever wondered what cool items you could get from Vanuatu, Packmule will be the place to go. Currently Packmule is completely free to use, and we're hoping to build up a nice critical mass of users to really test the service out while we build in some awesome new features. Beta invitations are available at [packmule.it](http://packmule.it)

- different methods of getting funding
- if i do design a product that is meant to sell at a large scale, how does one find someone to manufacture it
- the basics of technology patents: such as how to apply for a patent, costs, and where to find other similar patents
- how does one get a product into a store

However he mentioned he wanted to get investment, and that means our shares will be diluted, and at that point he (and the investor) may try to force me out (simply because he can), which means I'll lose my entitlement to salary (which will come from the revenue from selling the product that I built).

I attempted a startup 6 years ago and failed. I blamed a lot on various conditions, used a lot of excuses, but looking back, it was a damn good idea and it actually predicted where the market would be now. So to put it lightly, I feel pretty proud of myself that we could have seen this coming in this specific area of the market years before it happened. 

Why didn't it work out? I had subcontracted the programming/web development to a competent commission based programming team. In other words, they didn't really care what happened in the end as long as they got paid. There's mistake one. My business partner backed out on me to go to dental school, and it was simply too demanding. Not to mention the fact that I moved out of state because of family obligations. There's mistake two. Then I proceeded to think that perhaps I could run the whole thing by myself. 

I never found another partner, and now the startup is in the ground.

Roughly 2 years ago I had a moment of insight for a service that I know will be huge in the realm of integrated and normalized data communication. Over the two years I have talked to 50 or 60 programmers, trying desperately to get them involved, to no avail. I have spoken to maybe a hundred people over that course of time, but no one seriously committed to the project, though nearly everyone was convinced that the business model spectacular and the potential was monumental. Every time it seemed I had someone who wanted to work with me, something came up and they wavered. The whole thing is based off of momentum, stages of development. 2 weeks ago a service launched that was nearly identical and verbatim of the first leg of the business model. 

This pretty much stopped me in my tracks, and then the reality of the situation finally hit me.

Regardless of the size and scope of the idea, no matter how incredible it might be... I still don't have a business partner

I need to find that person, where are the people that are as hungry as I am to do something big, to create your own beautiful frankenstein? Am I alone in this problem?

For a while I've liked the concept of the 'revenue' figure within products like Google Analytics and KISSMetrics.  Unfortunately I have found that it's of little use other than as a broad metric of how things are progressing and hardly gives me a true feel of how good my profit / cash position really is.

I wanted to ask if other founders feel the same and how you tackle the problem?  I have also looked at InDinero, Xero and others and don't feel they really solve the problem.  

Perhaps there needs to be a service that targets the 'accounting' needs of a SaaS business...i.e. nothing more than easily recording revenue from their product, expenses from other SaaS products and their true cash position. 

Could also be a good way to keep track of those hard earned investment dollars!",,False,,t5_2qh26,False,,,True,t3_q3o6w,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/q3o6w/ask_reddit_how_do_you_do_accounting_at_your/,

We're still developing so technically they were bidding on the idea and not on any current revenue we're bringing in.

The structure was as follows:

35% investors

35% me and my co-founder (vested)

10% reserved for a CTO

20% for raising future capital (dilutable shares)

And to get all of the funding we had to meet certain sales goals on a monthly basis. We didn't really see the value in adding a CTO so early since we're outsourcing the development to 3 really good coders abroad at the moment and it's so much more cost efficient at this stage of the game. We're technical enough to handle the management of the devs on our own I think.

At the end of the day I think we can negotiate better equity if we self-funded and released first. As it is we would be taking a loss by accepting such a low offer merely because we're unproven (their words).

Any insight on the situation? Thanks guys!

We are a small software development shop, and our first product is a mobile application for healthcare.  We do Android, iOS, and will probably do Windows Mobile, but that's what this post is about.  Microsoft has this program called BizSpark.  It's to help companies like mine get started by providing FREE access to Office, Windows, Visual Studio, etc.  Actually almost a complete MSDN subscription for 5 users. SO, I apply, because we're a poster child for the program.  Small, &lt; 10 employees, &lt; 5 years in business, and &lt; 1m in revenue, which are the criteria.

I wait several weeks, and nothing, then I get a canned response 3 weeks later, saying ""we're real swamped, we'll get to it soon"", then another two weeks and I get a canned rejection, not specific about the reason.  I log in, but if you get rejected, you are actually BLOCKED from the site, so I can't see my application to appeal it.  I reply to the email stating that there must be a mistake, and I'd like to review my app with someone.  Another canned response, ""we're real busy"".  So, I do what I know might get things moving, and I tweet to @bizspark, and that gets things moving. I get a DM from Biz Sparks ""social media manager"" that he'd get someone to look at it. Another week. I then tweet that I'm pretty happy doing Android dev and using Google Apps, and that again gets things shaking again.  So, a 3rd party contractor contacts me today, and says ""the reason you got rejected is attached"". The attachment? A FUCKING Exchange/Oultook ""noname.eml"" file! I reply to her and CC MS Social media guy, asking them if this is a joke, that how could they expect me to read this .eml file, when the whole reason I'm here is to get access to MS products. The social media guy emails directly and says to take it easy on the lady, she's just doing her job, and I reply nicely that I'm not interested anymore, that I'd already wasted too much time on this, but she's just emailed me again, pasting her original email, which says something about 3rd party consultants are excluded. Another blown gasket.  HOW THE HELL CAN I SEE MY APPLICATION WHEN I'M BLOCKED FORM THE BIZ SPARK SITE!!??

~~DAMMIT!  MS Blows and they don't even know that the very program THEY started to help people like me like Microsoft again makes me HATE THEM EVEN MORE.~~  I'm leaving this here so my OP doesn't make replies out of context look bad, but this was unprofessional on my part.  I'll take a yellow card like a champ though.

Seriously, I wish I could get on Boing Boing or some other site with this, it's is just comical.

I thought it was pretty nifty -- I still have yet to see any image service match the power of my bookmarklet -- but both [HN](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2791266) and [Reddit were underwhelmed](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/j740n/hey_obsessive_image_collectors_of_reddit_i_made_a/).

Until, that is, I tried posting to /r/nsfw. The response there was [rather more enthusiastic](http://www.reddit.com/r/nsfw/comments/jiwmm/dear_nsfwers_i_made_a_thingy_to_help_collect_porn/). 

I got a couple thousand signups in 24 hours, and even a shoutout from [Fleshbot](http://straight.fleshbot.com/5831045/imagestash-a-thingy-to-help-collect-porn).

And then immediately after that I got a major day job upgrade and have been insanely busy and totally neglectful of the site ever since. 

It gets about 600 visits/day, with occasional spikes into the thousands when someone posts a popular tag in a forum or subreddit. It gets a small but steady trickle of pro account upgrades, feature requests, and the occasional (surprisingly friendly) takedown request from a gonewilder having second thoughts. There are currently 3,261 users storing 610,830 unique images (99GB worth) with 808,972 tags (5,654 unique). I have done zero promotion aside from the original HN and Reddit posts, and haven't been able to respond to the feature requests with anything but ""sorry, maybe someday"".

I'd like to hand it off to someone who will actually grow and improve it. That someone is definitely not me. I'm happily employed at one awesome startup, weekend consulting for friends on two others, and simply don't have the time or, if I'm honest with myself, the interest in this particular project. I started it mostly out of curiosity -- I wasn't sure the bookmarklet could work. But the users who are already there really seem to like it, and I don't want to shut it down on them just because I got bored. And if a single incompetent reddit post got it this far I have to think someone who actually knows how to market it could get a lot more attention. 

(It would also be pretty great if I could earn a modest return on the dev time I originally sunk into it. But I'm under no illusions that it's worth a fortune. I'm more concerned with giving it a good home.)

The problem is I have **no idea** where to find a buyer. ""Legitimate"" web site markets like Flippa have strict policies against adult material. Adult-specific markets like GFY are full of people looking to buy cookie cutter content sites. They wouldn't have a clue what to do with an image aggregator ""app"". I'm afraid I've painted myself into two corners: I've got something that's too popular to just abandon but not popular enough to quit my day job over, and too startup-y for the XXX world but too adult for the startup world.

**Any suggestions?**

I recognize that the initial content on my site will probably come from a few power users (and that I should be one of these users), but so far I have none. I am unable to become a power user because the website content belongs to a niche that I am not very experienced with.

I've gotten positive feedback from friends that have used the website, but I'm not sure how to go about finding power users. I've considered sharing it with a specific subreddit, but I haven't contributed to that subreddit and don't want those users to think I'm just using Reddit for my own gain.

I have some tips from watching her work. This is the 5th startup I've been ""part of"" though I try to keep my advice out of our marriage! Some things that have worked for her:

* A brand. It started with a logo, then a website, and now a new (more like evolved) logo and new website to go with it. More important than the graphics though is the impression she builds with the business: it very much reflects her style and attitude!

* Good use of the website and Facebook to show off her creations.

* Adaptable. She found that tutus sell like crazy right now. She figures that tutus are a fad and so she has done a good job mixing the tutus with her other creations to great success.

* Amazing personal networking. I've always done a good job at personal networking and she puts me to shame. She has friends and friends of friends selling for her! She also has vendors and even competitors bringing work in for her! She is social and outgoing by default and having a brand that matches her personality helps.

* Constantly striving to improve quality. Even though her products are hand assembled and the brand is N4OCD - Not for OCD - she still puts a lot of effort into improving her products.

* Figures out what she needs and finds a way to get it. This is one area that I have helped with. She needed a better machine to handle the quantity of work coming in. And then 3 months later she needed an even better machine! As you can imagine this hit us in the pocket book pretty hard but we figured out how to make it work which has led to a better business model for her. There's less waste due to machine overheating/fatigue. I suggested she keep the ""old"" machine as a backup (she was planning to sell it to offset some of the cost of the new one) and she's now using it in parallel with the new machine when things are really busy.

* Shops like crazy to keep overhead low. She is always looking for deals on material and other supplies and even the new giant production machine was purchased at half price saving thousands of dollars (she also used her personal network to help her land that deal). She also watches for events and clips coupons.

* Simple systems. She uses an Excel spreadsheet to track her orders.

* Follows up. She asks how gifts were received and asks for pictures of people wearing her products. Some of these shots end up on Facebook (with permission) but she loves getting these pictures and it seems to be fun for the customers to show off a bit. She also sends emails/texts/Facebook posts to past clients to check in with them which has led to return customers.

* She tells stories with her creations. Her products are not about the materials they are made from but rather the story that they represent. If you have a daughter and want her to be princess for a day, N4OCD is the place for you. My favorite story was when an old friend of mine (a man) was invited to a baby shower for a co-worker. He panicked and called my wife for help. She calmed him down and put together a newborn outfit and packaged it nicely for him to take to the shower. His gift was the hit of the party and he's been invited to 2 baby showers since! Not that he wants to go to baby showers but it seems there are benefits to being a single man that can give good baby gifts...

* She works hard. We have a young daughter that requires attention during the day so my wife uses that time to send emails and update posts. She does production in the evening and she is often up after midnight to make sure she hits her promised timelines.

* Her prices are low. When I pointed out that child workers in China make more per hour than she does, she finally raised her prices… a little. She wants to offer a good product and she wants it to be a good value. I think there is still some room for her to raise her prices and hit the mark she wants but I have to say that her strategy is working. She started profiting a couple months ago and bought me a big-screen TV as a surprise birthday present! Not only is it a gift for me but it’s a trophy for her success.

Those are things I can think of off the top of my head and I think most of those will apply to any startup. 

I am getting ready to build her 3rd generation website which will include custom online ordering. Before I get that rolling, though, I could use some feedback on the [site as it is now](http://n4ocd.com). One thing I’m seeing is that the typography could be improved a bit. Anything else I should be looking at?

The first guy my co-founder brought in.  Wasn't a fan of his, but he's turned out to be pretty good.

The second guy I chose.  I liked him because he had decent experience (built his own Android game, built API's, etc..)

I specifically told them that working hours are 10AM-6PM.

Tuesday (1st day) - 1 hour late
Wednesday (2nd day) - 45 min late
Thursday (today) - he's still not here yet, 2 hours late.

He's got our laptop, access to our code, and what not.. he's not answering his phone.  

What should I do?  I'd like to think a 10AM start time is pretty lenient.  

---------

EDIT:  Thank you guys.  You all are awesome for the suggestions.  I have to keep reminding myself I signed up for this adventure.

EDIT 2:  I've tried emailing him (work email, personal email), calling him (cell, home), and google chat multiple times today.  He's a black hole.  He has our laptop.  If he doesn't show up tomorrow, I'll be terminating the contract via email, with notification that we do not receive the laptop by Monday, we'll be reporting the laptop stolen to the police.

------------

EDIT 3:  So I didn't send him a threatening email or anything.  If he hadn't shown up today, I was going to do so.

Instead, I just got into the office and he was waiting for me.

He apologized for not being here yesterday.  His wife left him yesterday.  

Yep.. that sums it up.  Startup life.

Two friends and I have been developing a navigation app designed for walking.  It looks like a compass, but instead of pointing north, it points to any destination you want to go, showing you the distance and direction.  It's great for areas like college campuses, music festivals, and theme parks, where traditional navigation apps don't work. You can also save destinations into lists, called Maps, which you can then share with others in our database. You can also download maps made by other users to make things even easier!

We just released the app on the app store and wanted you to be some of the first people to try it out and give us feedback.

[Check it out on the app store](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/falcon/id506151543?mt=8) and let us know what you think! We especially appreciate any feedback you have on improving existing features or adding new ones.

- It's a free mobile app with real no revenue model.  Hoping someone big will buy it in the future with bigger market.
- Sam will be on the board of the startup, as well as act as an advisor.  Sam's two friends with no tech background will drive the product design.
- Sam has close relationships with some VCs, and once the first MVP is ready, Sam will present to the VCs.
- I will be the only tech person with mobile app background, so I'll be doing all the heavy lifting.  I've made something similar to their idea in the past so I know exactly what to do.

With all these in mind, working on the first MVP for next 2-3 months during weekends is ok to me.  If it works out, it'll be cool.  If not, it's not the end of the world.

My startup, http://surveylitics.com, lets you create surveys via email.

Turning an email into a survey can be a pretty tricky technical challenge, and it's the core of my startup, so it needs to be as reliable as possible.

==============
Want to help? All you have to do is write up some survey questions and email them to survey@surveylitics.com! Within 5-10 minutes or so, you should receive a reply containing a link to your newly created survey. Check it out, and make sure it looks like you expected it to (i.e. the questions are all correct, the choices are accurate, the name is right, and so on). If something doesn't look right, just post the URL or message it to me, and I'll try to fix the problem.

Here's an example of the kind of survey you might send:

    From: you@yourdomain.com
    To: survey@surveylitics.com
    Subject: Reddit Startups Survey
    
    Thanks for participating in this survey!
    
    1. What is your favourite subreddit?
    a. /r/startups, of course!
    b. /r/entrepreneur
    c. /r/business
    d. Other: _________
    
    2. What do you think of Surveylitics?
    
    Thanks for participating, now head back to http://www.reddit.com/r/startups for more fun!
    
    Cheers,
    Marty

And here's the result of that survey: http://surveylitics.com/Survey/QxzHr7s

Now, you don't have to format your survey exactly like this. Format it however YOU would expect to be able to write a survey, or how you would normally ask someone questions via email. If it looks reasonable, I want to support it!

Thanks everyone!

My main issue is a clause stating that the company has the right to retain all but 2% of shares accepted by the employee if termination of employment is decided by employer. Is a stipulation like this normal and couldn't the company terminate me after I work to reduce my compensation?

Half of the shares will be vested 18 months after the completion of the project, and the other half after 36 months.

These terms are negotiable. My plan was to try to get rid of the retention of shares entirely and have a graduated vesting schedule that gives me shares through steps of the project, so all of the shares when the project is completed. How should I proceed? 

TL;DR: Startup has clause to retain shares if it decides to terminate me; how should I negotiate.

I've been lurking /r/startups for a while and it seems the most appropriate.

My friend recently resigned from his position as a developer at a technology startup. The reasons are plenty and that's a horror story in itself. My friend signed non disclosure and non compete agreements when he started the job about 1 year ago. He gave the employer his social insurance number and was paid by check. From what I understand he was paid under the table - taxes weren't filled I believe.

The situation got very toxic when he gave the employer his 1-month
notice. The employer is telling my friend he'll make sure he can't work in software for 1 year and something about making him ""pay back"" the money he earned. My friend wants to review the contracts but the employer is apparently withholding them.

I'm no lawyer and don't have any experience in the finer details of law. As founders and employees of small companies, can /r/startups shed some light on this siltation? I'm specifically curious about:

1. The non-compete agreement. What is the usual period it is in place, upon signing, termination, or specific dates?
2. What can the employer do with my friend's SIN?
3. The part about making my friend pay back his wages. I don't even know what to make of this.

**This is the first public showing of my MVP, so its obviously not completely polished.** I have been busy over the last couple of months beavering away to get this from concept to creation, and so far I am fairly pleased with the core workings of it. I am a [Dad-epeneur](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/1frobb/any_other_dadepeneurs_out_there/), so it has been tough getting this to the point I am happy enough to show it off. Not being able to quit my day job, or work on it 24/7, this has happened in fits and starts mostly in the evenings or all nighters over the weekends.

As an avid web developer / geek / gamer / tech lover I find myself constantly finding projects or products I am interested in and want to follow. Some have social profiles, websites and blogs, but for the majority these are often left untapped in letting the public know about what they are working on. It becomes difficult and time consuming to follow so many different things manually, especially with the likes of kickstarter, indie developers, fast moving technology, and the current trend of innovation announcing awesome new things at a lightning pace.

Eventually these things get forgotten or fall into a mass of other saved links and rarely if ever get found again. I therefore tasked myself with creating a web service that would track those projects and then remind myself / the user about them at the appropriate times.

**Thus, Hype Badger (http://www.hypebadger.com) was born :)**

**Current features**

* Browsing existing projects

* Adding projects (with a title, image, description, and link)

* Updating projects (links, dates, etc)

* Comments

* Badgering (when you 'badger' or follow a project it will then send you reminders when the project or product has various milestones, eg announcements, releases, rumours etc)

* Adding additional links and dates

* Lots of planned upcoming features*

**Initially I am looking for some feedback from the community**, so ideally if you could let me know:

* what you think of the concept of the site / service

* what you like best

* what you like least

* what you think its missing

* if its a service you would / could use

This will help me determine what I need to work on next in order to make it a more usable, enjoyable, and inherently viral service. Its as much based on tracking / reminders, as it is on discovery. Unfortunatley you can't just google 'cool stuff' and it returns relevant, interesting projects and products, I am hoping Hype Badger will be the place for this to happen.

Thanks for reading :)

1328284574.0,16,self.startups,p9cqe,Hubski 8 months later: An update on my better social aggregator.,fangolo,24,8,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/p9cqe/hubski_8_months_later_an_update_on_my_better/,"Hey r/startups.

I shared http://hubski.com with you [8 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/he6yz/show_rstartups_hubski_a_thoughtful_web_or_yes_i/).

At that time, it looked like [this](http://i.imgur.com/kGyrz.png).

Needless to say, a lot has changed since then. When I started Hubski, I knew what I wanted to accomplish, but I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to go about it. As I stated in my earlier post:

&gt;""My goal for Hubski is to enable people to partake in good conversation about things that interest them, and to make it easy to filter out noise. I want to enhance the social nature of an aggregator, so you can build better communities and connections based on shared interests.”

That much remains true. However, through using the site, watching how other people use the site, and by talking to those people, I have developed Hubski into what it is now. This is how Hubski works:

Hubski is a social aggregator without shared pages. On Hubski, you follow people that you want to curate content for you; when you follow someone, you see posts that they make, and posts that they share. Likewise, people that follow you see your posts, and posts that you share. There is no voting on posts. There is no longer a karma system.

As a result of this design, posts spread across Hubski by sharing and resharing. Also, they spread into the feeds of people that tend to be interested in them. If you don’t like some posts that you are seeing, you simply unfollow the person that is sharing them with you. One bonus from this design is it makes moderation very hands-off.

There are a few other nifty things that we have done since. IMO, the most important ones to the site have been: 1) users can shout-out to each other in comments and posts by typing @user@, and 2) through use and sharing, and users slowly earn badges that they can attach to their [favorite posts or comments](http://hubski.com/badgesubs).

Also just yesterday we changed the way that users find new content. Now instead of a shared ‘all posts’ page, users can toggle how much external content can filter into their feed.

Anyhow, I thought all these changes were worthy of an r/startups update, and I’d appreciate any feedback that relates to them.

I am quite happy with the direction we have, and the progress we’ve made, but there is always room for improvement, and fresh eyes are invaluable.

Thanks!",,False,,t5_2qh26,True,,,True,t3_p9cqe,http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/p9cqe/hubski_8_months_later_an_update_on_my_better/,

I am currently working on a project and it is getting to the stage where I need to start thinking about how to get money from users.

The problem is, I've never done anything of the sort before, so this is all new to me. All I know so far is I need a payment gateway and a merchant account, which I need to see a bank about. Does the location of the bank matter? (I am based in Australia). Would you recommend using PayPal instead? (The whole credit card security auditing process scares me a little I don't think I am ready for it at such an early stage)

Hoping you good lot can give me a helping hand :)

Thank you for any advice you can provide.

Edit: 
For those of you who might still be interested: i just spent 4 hours implementing PayPal Express Checkout into my application. Another 4 hours was spent yesterday reading up on the documentation and stuff.
That's about a day's worth of work implementing it in ASP.NET C# with no prior experience with the API, done from scratch without any frameworks (just http request calls)
Its very rough around the edges, but I essentially can send a user to a checkout page with a list of items now and they can simply log into PayPal and process payment and it then gets returned to the site.

This post is in regard to obtaining blog posts/media outlets and traction.

Through my personal startups, I have had to obtain blog posts and have been featured on Techcrunch, as well as, several other more or less prominent outlets.

I stress:

* Doing research on the blog, the blogger themselves (what do they post about? What's their style? How do you fit in and grab their attention?), and what's the latest buzz about?

* Write a PERSONAL email. Pick one or two sentences that really boil down what differentiates yourself or is interesting to copy/paste and write the rest from scratch. Steer clean from the ""hard sell"" and write directly to the person.

* Personal subject title. I can't stress this enough, whatever first 10 titles comes to mind, trash them and write something that you would open yourself. ""[Blogger name's] personal invitation to..., or Hey [Blogger] can you help me with this problem? (then identify the problem and write the solution, ending with your company info)

*  Up the chain! Many of the larger media outlets find their stories and topics from smaller blogs. If you are interested in getting into industry blog X, do some googling to find which blogs they feed off of, then get on those! The more interesting the post, the more likely you'll get picked up and start heading up the ladder.

I'm in the process of getting off the ground with a startup that requires a SSL certification. i.e. not a shared SSL but a dedicated/custom one.

I was thinking of getting [this certificate](http://www.digicert.com/welcome/ssl-plus.htm) from DigiCert. 

I currently took out CDN subscription with CDN77.com - since this is my first startup, I am not able to make a comparison as such. I merely used [this](http://www.cdnplanet.com/compare/cloudfront/cdn77/) to decide. In hindsight, the stats there aren't that accurate (e.g. they DO charge a premium for APAC data). Furthermore, while they seem to have a base in the UK, US etc, I seem to be dealing with people primarily in the Czech Republic (regardless of the hours I email/call etc.). [This is merely an observation, and not intended to be racist in any way.]

Anyway, I contacted my VPS provider and they informed me that it was not an issue at all. I could either install the cert through cPanel and they too would be happy to do it for me. 

I then contacted CDN77 and asked them if they could install third party SSL certificates for me. I paste the response that I got from them below.

&gt;Hello,

&gt;We can not use your own cert, because of technical reasons.
&gt;We are using one cert for all CDN SSL resources.

&gt;This solution is fully valid and it is needed to have it this way, because we have over 70 servers worldwide and only one cert can be used per one IP address - so it would be very costly, if we would assign over 70 IPs for each new cert...

&gt;So this is the reason, why we need to add your domain to our cert via SAN (Subject Alternative Name) and why we can not use your own cert.

&gt;Thank you for your understanding.

&gt;Best Regards,

Now, I suppose here comes my list of questions to the gentlemen and scholars of /r/startups  ,

1. Is the above email... well BS? Is this merely a question of a company not being able/not wanting to implement 3rd party SSL certificates or is it a genuine issue?
2. Just with anything else, I suppose that you get what you pay for - however, are there alternative CDN's out there that offer great value for money on a pay as you use basis? (other than Cloudfront - I find it extremely clunky to work their interface) i.e. MaxCDN or anyone else?
3.  If 1. *is* a genuine issue, what are the CDN's around that offer free installation of 3rd party SSL certificates?
4. What companies offer decent SSL certification for non-US companies? i.e. that the paperwork doesn't take forever?
5. Is there really a difference from a security/crypto standpoint [within different dedicated SSL certs?](http://www.digicert.com/welcome/product-overview.htm#ev) or is it primarily just marketing hype?
6. As a sidenote, are you guys remote interested about the new ECC crypto certs which are due to be released in the near future? e.g. Certs [here](http://www.entrust.net/ecc-certs/index.htm) and a datasheet [here by Symantec](http://www.symantec.com/en/au/content/en/us/about/presskits/b-symantec_ssl_certification_with_ecc_algorithm.en-us.pdf). who recently bought over Verisign.

Anyway guys, I really appreciate all responses to this query.

One of the posters thought there was a lack of success stories and today my brother had a great one for me to share.

The news isn't public yet, so I'll have to refrain from the industry which is rapidly growing and the company itself. I can edit it later once it's announced if people care.

About two years ago, my brother and I decided we wanted to start our own company. We contemplated ideas and a ticketing platform was born. It's original concept was to never book a fail-band/show ever again by requiring a minimum number of tickets to be sold within a specified amount of time for it to officially book and transactions to be placed. Crowdfunded concerts.

Well, that went viral globally. We would wake up to tweets from Japan from being covered on Yahoo! Japan and many others. After a year in that, a pivot, and many learning curves ranging from developers, client acquisition, and more... we called it quits. There is a time you should be able to quit if need be and pursue other opportunities, I witness too many entrepreneurs wasting there time on their companies going no where. The market was too competitive to keep up and we didn't set up our company to be very investment friendly (it was launched for too long). We did, however, find out that there was a market in people *starting their own* ticketing companies, and sold the code.

That ended last December, and my brother had quit his cushy investment banking job to take a chance and a last stab at making our co succeed. So, last January he was jobless. He started researching many fields and landed in a industry he was very interested in. All I can really say at this point is it is a high growth industry of foreign exchange.

He then turned to codeacademy, &amp; mentored from our previous CTO (who owns 10% of this new venture), and taught himself to code enough to build the website within a few months with our previous CTO. 

He became part of that community online and quickly built a new platform. He posted his co on angellist and was quickly approached by some investors. This week he flew out to New York and today I received news that he was given a $2mm valuation and term papers. He is now travelling to meet First Mark's founder, Ashton Kutcher, and it sounds like many more. I am so proud of him, he worked hard, made his family very proud, and accomplished his goal before his bank account depleted.

What I've learned from him - is hard work, research, and determined implementation really pays off. I've seen things like this happen a few times here in Vegas with our new downtown project and Vegas Tech community. There are opportunities all around us.

I built this site on a whim I had while on vacation for the holidays. Ever find good porn but can't *get* to it right away? What about stuff you really enjoyed, where do you save it? If you're like me, you don't want naughty stuff in your browsing history and especially not in your bookmarks. So I built **[http://xstashed.com/](http://xstashed.com/accounts/register/)** - a place to stash your nsfw gems.

While it's a minimal viable product, I do have a basic road map that can be viewed here http://xstashed.com/todo/. As you can see a bookmarklet is on my todo list. I'll likely get to that tomorrow. (I tend to get distracted while testing if you know what I mean.) Along with that there will be a simple API that will be open for 3rd parties. I just wanted to get this in the hands of potential users to get feedback early on.

On the tech side of things i've built this thing nimble so that I can quickly shape the site from your feedback. For those who are interested  xstashed is a custom Django (Python) application continuously deployed with Chef. MySQL for database, Celery for background task, and Redis for cache and Celery broker.

Register, try it out, use it, try to break it, show your friends, and leave feedback here.


Thanks!

Edit:

I appreciate all of the feedback from Reddit, and wanted to provide you with an update. In an effort to keep the service anonymous, email is no longer required to sign-up. I've also created a basic bookmarklet that you can find in the sidebar. Anything added from your bookmarklet will go into your ""New"" stash. Retention hasn't been great so i'm hoping the bookmarklet will vastly improve the whole experience by making it easier to utilize the service.

How can I reach out to people in SF and NYC areas?**

I run a small web-based software development shop (five people) located almost next door to the University of Michigan.  Over the past couple of years we've begun to transition more towards consulting rather than actually writing code for other people. Much of this is consulting on cloud-based application architecture and deployment, primarily with Amazon Web Services.  I founded and currently run the AWS user group for Michigan. We help companies, esp. start-ups, design (or refactor) their code to be more scalable/durable in the cloud, reduce their AWS costs, etc.  We also provide managed DevOps services where we function as the client's primary point-of-contact for Amazon, provide support to the developers and their tools, get them setup using continuous integration and browser-based regression testing, coordinate deployment amongst the different environments, using an actual development methodology, etc.

In short, we act as highly-specialized, ""developer friendly"" outsourced IT department for companies building cloud-based applications.  This allows their developers to stay focused on their code and we handle pretty much everything else.  

Our ideal client is a tech start-up who's recently gotten their Series A funding and needs to quickly ""grow up"" (fixing architecture issues with the initial app version, doing real QA, coordinating development among more than just one guy hacking away).  I'm pretty plugged into the start-up community locally, but honestly, there just aren't that many opportunities here.  There's a strong engineering culture here in Michigan as a result of the automotive industry.  This is the primary reason my team and I have the experience working with larger software projects.  How do I tap into the larger start-up communities out in the Bay area or in NYC?  Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.

It is a web application for creating collaborative comic books. Every member has the ability to add panels to a comic and create a strange and crazy story. This is a game my friends and I would all play when we would meet up at comic conventions.  There was no easy way for us to do this over the internet so I wanted to create a tool for my friends and I to make jam comics.

In walks [This Exquisite Forest](http://www.exquisiteforest.com/) a collaborative art project backed by Google and the Tate Modern and made by some remarkably talented and experienced people.  It is considerably different from We Draw Comics in that it aims to create animation rather than comics, and allows a project to branch out into multiple paths rather than create a linear story.  However one of its key selling points and what seems to be the most amazing to everyone is the collaborative art aspect. It excels in explaining the idea of collaborative art and how it has been around for ages, it also has a great aesthetic (two things my site is really lacking). I am extremely impressed and in love with what they have made.

I am also bummed out because I feel my project will no longer seem novel or groundbreaking. I was gearing up for a kickstarter in September, but now I feel my application will continually be compared to this and I have no idea how I will be able to stand out. Am I just being stupid?

Is there anything I should be doing? Do I attempt to open up my beta early? Or do I just keep my head down and stay the course and hope for the best?

* We have a [cross-platform marketplace for games](http://clay.io/store) (Check it out on your phone)
* [Our API](http://clay.io/docs) lets developers add a lot of the higher level features with just a couple lines of code (things like achievements, leaderboards, payment processing, analytics, etc)
* Finally, through our API, we're trying to give more meaning to achievements and high scores. Since they're tied to a single account across all platforms, there's a bit more motivation to actually earn the achievements. A goal of ours for this is to make our achievements as desired as, say, Xbox Live's &amp; gamerscore

Why are so few talking about this? Why are so many Angels, VC's, and entrepreneurs ignoring this? What's your opinion?*

Today I had a meeting with an old-time tech and SV professor/entrepreneur/investor (both angel and VC). We spent a few hours kicking it at Caffe del Doge, reviewed a product I'm working on, discussed some legal concerns I had regarding an acquisition, etc; pretty straight forward. Btw they serve some fantastic lemonade there, #gasm.

Towards the end of the meeting though, I led into some very straightforward questions about the social/tech bubble that's going on, issues with the EU, and how he sees these issues effecting the investment and startup scene. I'm only 19, but even since moving here I feel like investors are betting on and gaming startups the same way that wall street bets on and games stocks.. and the money flow is completely superficial, a lot of hot air, you know? I wanted his honest opinion. Well, I got it. *Let's just say it was depressing as fuck, and it was backed up by numbers and experience.* 

What's weird is that these conversations are completely low-key, I mean he actually leaned forward and was speaking in quieter tones. It's like no-one wants to talk about this stuff. Standards for [early stage] investment have been raised significantly in the last 9 months, but many are still pretending these issues aren't real. *Why?* I've experienced these same hushed tones speaking with others as well. Shouldn't everyone be talking about this? Why the hell aren't people straight up about this, especially when advising young entrepreneurs such as myself? 

As I see it though, it's a positive thing. If/when our superficial tech-investing-bubble pops, it means that we'll actually have to start creating businesses that make money and self-finance!! No shit. Sorry, I'm a bit cynical, but I'm tired of the 'app-fetish,' and people creating businesses and products that have no capital value or business model, but depend on solely on investment and acquisition. Idk, maybe I'm just not part of the right circles yet.
