Now this isn't a post saying he should be playing or starting but its a post about how some of us are bashing a goalie that is on our own team. 

Fleury is not an opposing goaltender, he is part of the Penguins. Stop bashing and jumping ship on him because he doesn't deserve to be treated that way. Sure some may say that he deserves to get the hate because he's basically played piss-poor for the last two playoffs, but he's never spoke out against the crowd, never given up on the team and he's just been working hard and trying to win games. This isn't Philadelphia, let's not be the team that runs out our goalie because we turned on him after two poor playoffs seasons. I will always support and be behind Fleury as long as he remains a Pittsburgh Penguin. Same goes with Vokoun and I will be supporting him as well tonight. 

Don't knock your own players

I'm a Sens blogger known as ""[Radek Bonk's Mullet](https://twitter.com/BonksMullet)."" I made the trip to game 2 and I just have to say I was absolutely blown away by how friendly Penguins fans are. Of course my friend and I got ribbed for our jerseys, but we had countless Pens fans approach us, chat us up, and thank us for coming to Pittsburgh. One guy even bought me a beer before the 3rd. I was also surprised to learn that someone who owns a Crosby jersey is old enough to buy beer, (is there a special bylaw or something?).

I expect if the scoreboard were flipped, we wouldn't have had as warm a reception, but I had to thank someone for the hospitality.

[I put together a photo journal of my experience here](http://www.bonksmullet.com/2013/05/pittsbonk-photo-diary-of-game-2-in.html). I'm sorry for defiling your Mario statue, but at least it was only an Islander.

Every time the song is played, it puts money in the pocket of a convicted child molester.",elixir_is_zog,112,27,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/penguins/comments/1k7r16/why_did_the_pens_switch_back_to_rock_roll_2_as/,"(yep, it's August, and I'm tired of hearing about the DMV)

I'm not one to get too worked up about rock star antics, or worry too much about a performer's politics (Ted Nugent doesn't like Obama: fantastic; the Dixie Chicks hate America: wunderbar), but I draw a hard line when it comes to a full on pedophile like Gary Glitter.

The guy's record is pretty disgusting: convicted of possessing child pornography in the UK, permanently banned from Cambodia for sex crimes with children, convicted of sex with 9-11 year old children in Vietnam, and most recently arrested again in the UK for child molestation as part of the BBC sex scandal. Put simply, the guy's the lowest form of scumbag.

Why does this matter to a Pens fan? Because last season, the team started using Rock &amp; Roll #2 (the Hey! song) as a goal celebration song again. The way we were cranking out goals at home (shuddup Bruins fans), we were hearing quite a bit last season. 

Most other professional sports leagues have dropped the song (the NFL allows for a cover version, but Glitter still gets a songwriter royalty). I think that the Pens need to move on as well. Hearing this slime tarnishing every one of our home goals really starts to wear on me. Makes me wonder why the organization made such a move, particularly in light of all of the fantastic things that they do for children in the greater Pittsburgh area.

Do we go back to Blur's Song #2 (the Woohoo song) or find something new (anything but 7 Nation Army)? I don't really care. I just don't want to cheer for a pedophile.

What do you think?

TL/DR: The Pens goal song (Rock &amp; Roll #2) is written and performed by a pedophile. We can do better.

But while I'm here I'd like to take a page out of the movie, 'Anchorman' and say when it comes to Pittsburgh, I pure, straight *HATE* you... But GOD DAMMIT do I respect you. 

You have good players, an intelligent coach and a devout, passionate fanbase. And while we don't want to admit it, we're very much alike. We always have good games against each other, and to be quite honest it's a shame we're meeting this early. So in conclusion, whether this series goes 4, 5, 6 or the full 7, I'm gonna enjoy the hell out of it.

**Last 10:**  New York 6-1-3; Pittsburgh 8-2-0 

**Season Series:** The Pittsburgh Penguins won four of five matchups against the New York Islanders during the regular season.  

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; The last game captain Sidney Crosby played was against these Islanders, when he suffered a broken jaw by taking a puck to the mouth on March 30. Crosby, who still led the Penguins in scoring this season with 56 points (15 goals, 41 assists) in 36 games, will visit the doctor again Tuesday and is still hoping he will make his return in Game 1 on Wednesday at Consol Energy Center.

&gt; “I’m just going for an appointment, [we’ll] see what happens,” Crosby said Monday. “I don’t have any control over it, so there’s no point in getting too worked up about it.”






**Islanders:**

&gt; New York dropped the final three of its season-ending, five-game road trip and finished eighth in the Eastern Conference. But the Islanders did collect points in four of those contests (2-1-2) and have lost only one game in regulation this month.

&gt; “It’s a challenge for our team,” Islanders coach Jack Capuano said after Monday’s practice. “We got ourselves in this situation by playing a certain way and we’ve just got to keep going about our business no different than we did the last two months of the year.”







From [NHL.com]( http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012030111&amp;navid=sb:preview   )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik missed the final two regular-season games with a lower-body injury. He skated prior to Monday’s practice and will be a game-time decision Wednesday, according to coach Dan Bylsma. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Islanders center John Tavares led the club with 47 points (28 goals, 19 assists) in 48 games this season. He had four goals and an assist over the final five games of the regular season. … Morrow had 14 points (six goals, eight assists) in 15 games for Pittsburgh after being acquired from the Dallas Stars. He had a goal and four assists over the final four contests.

I know we're all a little under the weather at the moment, but I just wanted to say a few quick things.

I know we've had a number of Bruins fans come here, and some have said productive things/offered insight, and some have been not so illuminating...

So there I just want to say, please don't go do this over in their sub.  I'll try and deal with those who come here just to troll, but it will only make it 10x worse if people start making comments over there.

The second thing is about tomorrow's game thread, I know it's going to be crazy in there, and my inbox may never be the same, but please, please, please! just try and stay calm and not antagonize in anyway.  Let's be the bigger men/women.  Don't talk about fandom-based downvoting, or get upset when someone calls Crosby Cindy for the millionth time....it's not going to accomplish anything, and if nothing is said from our end, it's less fodder for them.  It's frustrating, believe me I feel as you do, but let's just try and enjoy the game.

Hopefully the boys remember they're a top caliber team, and that they need to work together, and we have a few great games here.

LET'S GO PENS!!

What should I know? Got any traditions I should know about, or any weird things you guys do? Just as a hockey fan I know a bit about your history but I'll likely be reading up on more in the next little bit. Who has the A's in Pittsburgh, any chance they give it up for Iggy? Where do you see him slotting in?

Now comes the sappy part. Unlike Boston evidently we may have to tell your fans what it means to have your franchise player leave to another team to try and win a cup. Please treat him well. You'll love him especially if he's there long term. He goes out into the community, and will talk to anyone who wants to. My favourite Iggy story is in 2002 when he ran into a group of Canadians during the Olympics staying in their car and ended up buying them a hotel room on his dime. He is also great with the media, and always gives you everything he has with a smile on his face. You now have a million more fans in the middle of Alberta.

I have been a terrible jinx for our beloved Pens this year.  I should have realized this sooner, and corrected my actions.  I am currently deployed overseas and don't get to catch many games live.  Usually when I watch them I watch the delayed feed that is played about 10 hours after the game.  But on a few occassions I wake up around 2 a.m. (3 a.m. lastnight) to watch/listen  and cheer on my team, and everytime I have we lost. 

I watched/listened to 4 regular season games, all of them loses and 2 of them ended our extended win streaks.  I watched the first loss to the Islanders, and listened to the second Islanders loss and the loss to Ottawa.  So I should have known better than to tune in lastnight and cheer on my team.  

So I will limit myself to reading the articles and watching the highlights for the remainder of the series.  Oh and bonus fact, I have lived in the Pittsburgh area since I was 4.  The only times I have not been home to watch the games we have won a championship.  I had moved with my mother so she could take care of a sick Family Member for the 91 and 91 cup wins.  I was away at Military College and at Ft. Benning for the Steelers Super Bowl wins, and I was at Ft. Knox for Armor school when the Pens last won the cup, so things are looking good for us this year haha.

Typing this out made me remember a funny story about the last cup win.    I was at Armor Officer Basic Course for a majority of the last half of the Season, and all of the Playoffs.  One of the guys in my Platoon was a huge Detroit fan, and he was a smug bastard too.  The entire time I knew him he rubbed the Pens loss in my face.  We were able to watch the first 5 games of the cup final before we went out to the field the day of game six.  We didn't have any way of checking the scores while we were out there, but one of the other Instructors was also a Pens fan.  So he told me when they won Games 6 and 7, but I decided not to tell the Detroit Fan.  I let him run his mouth for the entire 10 days we were out there.  Finally we pack up and go back to the rear, and as we are getting off the bus he says, ""Well I'm going to go watch the highlights of the Red Wings hoisting the cup again.""  I looked him in the eyes and told him, ""Pens won the cup, I've known for the past week.""  The look on his face was priceless.",,False,self,t5_2r549,False,,,True,t3_1fijiz,http://www.reddit.com/r/penguins/comments/1fijiz/i_must_apologize_to_you_guys_and_the_penguins/,

**Big Story:**  

&gt; It's win or go home for the New York Islanders, who need to beat the Pittsburgh Penguins on back-to-back nights to win a Stanley Cup Playoff series for the first time since 1993. The Penguins, who've won three of four visits to the Nassau Coliseum this season, will try to close out their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal and beat the Islanders in a playoff series for the first time in their history. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Pittsburgh opted not to practice Friday, but captain Sidney Crosby picked up another honor anyway when he was named a finalist for the Hart Trophy as the MVP of the regular season. Crosby was running away with the scoring title until a deflected shot broke his jaw March 30 and kept him out until Game 2 of this series.

&gt; All he's done in the next four games is score three goals and add five assists to bring the Penguins within one victory of a second-round series against the Ottawa Senators. But to do so, they'll have to beat an Islanders team that's sure to be revved up by a raucous home crowd.

&gt; ""This is always the toughest one, the fourth one,"" Crosby told Penguins TV on Friday. ""They've played good hockey here. It's going to take our best to finish off the series. Last night's game was a good step for us -- we fee like that's how we need to play to finish it off.""










**Islanders:**

&gt; New York has its own Hart Trophy finalist, fourth-year center John Tavares, who carried the team for much of the regular season. He was tops on the Islanders with 47 points in 48 games and third in the NHL with 28 goals. The Islanders were 15-6-2 when he scored a goal and 20-7-2 when he had at least one point.

&gt; ""I always look at what that player does for your team,"" coach Jack Capuano said Friday. ""Let's face it. If John Tavares didn't have the season that he had, we're probably not in the situation that we're in. He did a lot for our team and he's going to get some consideration. There's no doubt that he should be in that category.""

&gt; Tavares said the Islanders' first trip to the playoffs since 2007 and their better-than-expected performance against the top-seeded Penguins is a group effort.

&gt; ""Obviously we're in this battle right now, but it's not just one man, one line, or five or six guys pulling their weight,"" he told the media Friday. ""We had contributions from everybody down the stretch to get ourselves in the playoffs and now be in this position. Everybody has contributed in a big way.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; The Penguins report no injuries. … The Islanders have lost one of their top defensemen, Andrew MacDonald, for the rest of the playoffs with a broken hand suffered in Game 4. Center Frans Nielsen left Game 5 with a lower-body injury and is expected to be a game-time decision. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Crosby has at least one point in each of the four games he's played. Evgeni Malkin (2-7-9), Jarome Iginla (1-7-8) and Pascal Dupuis (4-2-6) have points in all five games. Chris Kunitz has two goals and five points in the past three games. … Islanders center Casey Cizikas leads all rookies with four playoff points.

His hockey IQ is the main variable leading the charge.  His work ethic/battle level is very good.  His offensive skill set is a perfect match for players like Crosby/Malkin.  

His wrist will eventually be 100% which will improve his shot.  He will also be able to add more muscle mass to his frame.  At 22 years old it only goes up from here.

He found a way to create offense down a goal, in the third period, while playing limited minutes with Glass and Adams.  His back check through the neutral zone slowed up the Canes player which gave Adams time to pinch him off.  The puck was transitioned quickly up ice and Bennett quickly found a soft spot and made the most of his time and space.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; After dropping Game 1 on Saturday night, the Pittsburgh Penguins find themselves training in a series for the first time in the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs. Pittsburgh was shut out for the first time since Feb. 1, 2012, in a 3-0 loss to the Boston Bruins in Game 1 of this Eastern Conference Final at Consol Energy Center. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Pittsburgh breathed a sigh of relief Sunday when it learned that winger Matt Cooke’s services will be available for Game 2.

&gt; Cooke was handed a five-minute major for checking Bruins defenseman Adam McQuaid from behind and a game misconduct, leading many to believe he would face a possible suspension. Cooke declined to speak with reporters after Saturday’s loss, but he did address the media Sunday.

&gt; ""I chipped the puck in early just after the red line,"" Cooke said. ""I had some interference run from [Bruins defenseman Torey] Krug, which pushed me inside. After I got by him I look up and I see [McQuaid's] right shoulder, and he looks me right in the eyes. I think at the last minute he goes to make a reverse with the puck, but I've committed to hit him. I don't drive him through the boards. I make contact. I think it's a penalty, but I don't think it's an ejection or a suspension. That's my opinion.""















**Bruins:**

&gt; Tuukka Rask has somewhat flown under the radar this postseason, but he received plenty of attention for his performance Saturday, and rightfully so. The Bruins’ goaltender stopped all 29 shots he faced for his first shutout of the playoffs. Rask is now 9-4 this postseason with a 2.06 goals-against average and .933 save percentage.

&gt; Rask was helped by center David Krejci’s pair of goals and a defense that held the high-powered Penguins to just seven shots on goal in the third period.

&gt; ""Tuukka stood tall and made a lot of saves at the right time,"" Bruins winger Brad Marchand said Sunday. ""We just want to make sure we collapse low and try to take away lanes. They make a lot of seam passes and stuff like that so we want to make sure we take that away. But for the most part, Tuukka just stood tall.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; Bruins defenseman Wade Redden (upper body) did not dress for Game 1. He missed the entire conference semifinal series against the New York Rangers. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Krejci now has seven goals this postseason and leads the League with 19 points. He has 45 points in his past 45 playoff games, dating back to the start of the 2011 postseason, when the Bruins hoisted the Stanley Cup.

**Big Story:** 

&gt; The Pittsburgh Penguins didn't have Sidney Crosby in the lineup for Game 1 of their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series against the New York Islanders -- but they didn't miss him. The Penguins completely outplayed the Islanders in a 5-0 victory and will try to take a two-game lead in the best-of-7 series before it shifts to the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum for games Sunday and Tuesday. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; The stat sheet said the Islanders outhit the Penguins 41-36 in the opener, but the Penguins' physical dominance was apparent almost from the opening faceoff. The Penguins were all over the Islanders' defenders in the offensive zone, swarmed their skill players in the Pittsburgh zone and won puck battles all over the ice.
Forward Brenden Morrow wants that to continue in Game 2.

&gt; ""If we can slow them down by playing physical against them, wear them down, make them have to fight for every inch on the ice, then I think that's kind of what our focus is with a lot of their players,"" he said after Thursday's practice.







**Islanders:**

&gt; The only positive the Islanders can take from Game 1 is that it was only one game. New York was dominated for almost the entire 60 minutes on Wednesday night and generated only sporadic pressure while the Penguins were all over them. The Islanders looked nothing like the team that went 11-1-2 down the stretch to earn its first playoff berth since 2007.
One key for the Islanders in Game 2 will be to avoid dwelling on their poor showing in Game 1.

&gt; ""That's behind us,"" captain Mark Streit told the media after Thursday's practice at the Consol Energy Center. ""We lost. They played a strong game and now it's time to move forward and really concentrate on the next game.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; The Islanders report no injuries, though goaltender Evgeni Nabokov was using a backup mask Thursday after a shot by Jarome Iginla in Game 1 took a chunk out of his helmet. … Crosby (broken jaw) skated again at practice on Thursday and spent some time with the power-play unit but still has not been cleared to play and has no timetable for a return. Coach Dan Bylsma had no update on forward James Neal, who left Game 1 with a lower-body injury and didn't practice Thursday. Defenseman Brooks Orpik, who sat out Game 1 with a lower-body injury, skated for a second straight day on Thursday and may be close to returning. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Pascal Dupuis, who usually plays on the wing with Crosby, had a pair of goals without him in Game 1. Goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 26 shots for the sixth playoff shutout of his career and his first since 2011.

Last 10: Pittsburgh 8-2-0, Montreal 6-4-0

Season Series: The Pittsburgh Penguins will be seeking a season sweep of the Montreal Canadiens in the third and final meeting between the top two clubs in the Eastern Conference. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Evgeni Malkin, who was hoping to return from an upper-body injury against Montreal, was not skating on a regular line at practice on Tuesday so his status remains uncertain for this game. The reigning Hart Trophy-winner reportedly is bothered by right shoulder soreness that has affected his ability to shoot the puck. Pittsburgh is still without captain Sidney Crosby, who's recovering from a broken jaw.

&gt; But in spite of all their injuries, the Penguins just keep rolling along -- they've won four in a row and are 19-2-0 in their last 21 games.



**Canadiens:**

&gt;  Montreal is coming off two humiliating losses and arrives in Pittsburgh in a state of flux.

&gt; The Canadiens, starting with general manager Marc Bergevin and coach Michel Therrien right down to the players, have said all season long that the team's goal was to make the playoffs. Even when it became obvious that was going to happen as the Canadiens were challenging the Penguins and the Boston Bruins for the Eastern Conference lead, everyone stuck to the message that the playoffs were the goal.

&gt; Once that goal was achieved, the Canadiens appeared to fall apart, allowing 12 goals in consecutive losses to the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday and at home to the Philadelphia Flyers on Monday night.

&gt; ""We have to make a decision. In every opportunity, every experience there's a decision to be made. Do we move forward? Do we learn from this? Do we get better because of this? Or do we tuck out tails between our legs and cower?"" defenseman Josh Gorges said after practice Tuesday. ""I think this is a chance for us to grow as a team and understand exactly what it takes to win.""

&gt; Therrien will turn to Peter Budaj in goal after Carey Price was pulled in his last two starts.



From [NHL.com](http://www.nhl.com/ice/preview.htm?id=2012020640&amp;navid=sb:preview )

---

### Injury Report:

&gt; The Canadiens are missing defensemen Alexei Emelin (knee) and Raphael Diaz (concussion) and forward Colby Armstrong (knee)…The Penguins are missing center Crosby (jaw), forward James Neal (concussion), defenseman Paul Martin (hand) and perhaps Malkin. 

---

**Big Story:** After the Pittsburgh Penguins blitzed the New York Islanders in the series opener, the team getting off to the fast start hasn't fared so well in the last two games. The Islanders earned a split in Pittsburgh by rallying from a 3-1 deficit after the first period of Game 2, but after they raced to a 2-0 lead in Game 3, electrifying the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum crowd, the Penguins responded to score the next four goals and eventually earned a 5-4 overtime win when Chris Kunitz connected on a power play 8:44 into overtime. They'll now aim to take a 3-1 lead back to Consol Energy Center. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; When it went on a two-man advantage with just over seven minutes remaining in the first period of Game 3, Pittsburgh was reeling. The Penguins gave up the final three goals of Game 2 to lose, then a couple quick ones on Sunday. But everything turned when Jarome Iginla tipped in a Kris Letang shot and then Kunitz scored on a breakaway 19 seconds later.

&gt; Even though the Penguins would let a two-goal lead of their own slip away in the third, Kunitz rescued them with his second and the team's third power-play goal of the afternoon. Marc-Andre Fleury made 32 saves in an up-and-down performance, but despite taking some blows the No. 1 seed is still in the driver's seat in this series.

&gt; ""We did a great job of hanging in there, being able to get the momentum back in our favor,"" Iginla told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.









**Islanders:**

&gt; Carrying the momentum into its first home game in the Stanley Cup Playoffs in six years, New York couldn't have followed the blueprint much better -- Matt Moulson and Casey Cizikas scored in the first 5:41 of Game 3 and it looked as though the Islanders might return the favor from their Game 1 defeat.

&gt; Of course, the Penguins woke up, but the Islanders still recovered after finding themselves down 4-2 heading into the third. A shorthanded goal by Kyle Okposo got the comeback started, then John Tavares forced overtime with his first career playoff goal. A holding penalty by Brian Strait led to the game-winner by Kunitz, but the Islanders weren't hanging their heads afterward.

&gt; ""We didn't come into this series wanting to make it close. We wanted to win the series. We believe in ourselves and all the guys in here,"" Moulson said. ""All year, I think we've been in situations like this. We just need to stick to our game. We can't get too high or too low at any point.""

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Sidney Crosby had three assists in Game 3 after scoring two goals in his return to the lineup on Friday.Evgeni Malkin made a great pass to set up the first Kunitz goal and has three straight multi-point games to start the series. Iginla had two assists in each of the first two games before scoring his first playoff goal for the Penguins on Sunday. Kunitz finished the game with three points. … Moulson and Okposo have each scored in consecutive games for the Islanders.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Both teams will be well-rested and eager to get back to the Stanley Cup chase after relatively easy five-game series wins in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. The Penguins' offense erupted for 22 goals against the Ottawa Senators, including 13 over the final two games. The Bruins played a much lower-scoring series with the New York Rangers but raced out to a commanding 3-0 lead before eventually closing it out back on home ice.

&gt; Jarome Iginla, sent to the Penguins at the NHL Trade Deadline after he was initially rumored to be going to the Bruins, is fourth on Pittsburgh in playoff scoring with four goals and 12 points in 11 games.



---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Like its opponent, Pittsburgh seemed to only get stronger after a first-round scare -- in their case from the New York Islanders. Locked in a 2-2 series against a No. 8 seed they were expected to handle easily, the Penguins needed a Game 6 overtime win to advance. They then proceeded to blitz the overmatched Senators, shoring up on the back end and in goal. Indeed, as the conference final begins, the Penguins appear to be clicking on all cylinders again.

&gt; Vokoun is 6-1 with a 1.85 goals-against average and .941 save percentage since getting the call for Game 5 of the Islanders series. Kris Letang leads NHL defensemen in scoring with 16 points, tying him with Evgeni Malkin for the team lead; Sidney Crosby has 15 points in 10 games since returning from a broken jaw; and James Neal scored five goals over the final two games against Ottawa.

&gt; ""It's going to be fun, going to be a tough series,"" defenseman Matt Niskanen said. ""They're a very good team, a well-balanced team with a lot of depth, some good players. So it's going to be a good challenge for us.
 
&gt; ""Since I've been here, our speed has done well against them and we've had a pretty good record against them in the regular season. But we all know in the playoffs that might not be the story. It can be a whole new ballgame and quite a challenge going against them.""














**Bruins:**

&gt; The momentum from an amazing Game 7 comeback against the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round appeared to carry over for Boston, which took the series opener against the Rangers in overtime and stayed in complete control throughout the series.

&gt; The Bruins survived despite a banged-up defense that got Dennis Seidenberg back in Game 5 and could have fellow veteran Andrew Ference in the lineup again soon. Their absences allowed Torey Krug, who had played in three career NHL games prior to the second round, to step in and score four goals (three on the power play) in his first five postseason contests.

&gt; Boston also received balanced scoring from its forwards, and Tuukka Rask gave up two goals or fewer in the four victories.

&gt; ""We've played against [Pittsburgh] enough and we have a lot of respect for that team, the way they're coached, and they have four really good lines and guys that contribute and they got scoring from every line and they're not too far removed from winning the Stanley Cup,"" said forward Gregory Campbell, who scored twice in the close-out game against the Rangers. ""And they know how to win, so I think it will be a great matchup. We're excited about it, and we're going to have to be good.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ference (lower body) and defenseman Wade Redden (upper body) missed the entirety of the second round for Boston. Ference has been practicing with the team and could be a Game 1 possibility. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  The Bruins' fourth line of Campbell, Daniel Paille and Shawn Thornton combined for four goals and six assists in five games against the Rangers. Krug is the first rookie defenseman in the post-expansion era to score four goals in his first five playoff games. … Neal (5-2-7) and Letang (1-6-7) sparked the Penguins' offense in Games 4 and 5 against the Senators.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Holding Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, James Neal, Chris Kunitz, Pascal Dupuis, Jarome Iginla and Kris Letang off the board in the same game isn't an easy feat to accomplish, but the Ottawa Senators did it Sunday night. They also got an incredible shorthanded goal in the final half-minute of the third period and went on to defeat the Pittsburgh Penguins 2-1 in double overtime to climb back into their Eastern Conference Semifinals series. They'll try to tie things up Wednesday before action shifts back to Consol Energy Center. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; The opportunity is still there for Pittsburgh to make this a short series -- a victory in Game 4 would give them a commanding 3-1 lead heading back home. But the Penguins also may be in for a fight similar to or even greater than the one the New York Islanders gave them in the first round, and they only have themselves to blame.

&gt; Tyler Kennedy's goal late in the second period and the shutout goaltending of Tomas Vokoun had the Penguins up 1-0 in the latter stages of the third when Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson was sent off for slashing the stick of Matt Cooke. The Penguins didn't need to score, merely to control the puck and make it tough for the Senators to pull Craig Anderson for an extra attacker. They failed at that, then lost track of Daniel Alfredsson on the game-tying goal.

&gt; ""We let this one slip away,"" Vokoun said. ""To let [Ottawa] score on our power play, that's tough to take. Sometimes you have to go through adversity. I guess this is ours. The game has to end somehow, and there's nothing we can do about it. … We're still up 2-1 [in the series] and now Wednesday is a big game for us.""












**Senators:**

&gt; The big story at the start of Game 3 was the return of center Jason Spezza to the lineup after missing more than three months following back surgery. Spezza didn't have a point and was on the ice for Kennedy's goal, but he skated 33 shifts for 18:40 of ice time and came out feeling fine, despite absorbing a crushing hit from Craig Adams in the first overtime.

&gt; By the end of the night, all the talk was about Milan Michalek and Alfredsson teaming up for the brilliant, game-tying goal with 28.6 seconds left in regulation, and Colin Greening scoring the winner 7:39 into the second OT despite still having shards of fiberglass in his cheek from a high stick he took earlier in the contest.

&gt; ""I think if you look at our team, especially in the latter part of the season, we've been winning games when we've had to,"" Greening said. ""In a situation like tonight when you're down 1-0, to be honest, they were playing really well in the last 10 minutes, they were staying above us and it was hard to get any momentum. But we had to keep at it and stay with the structure of our team. It was nice to see because you get rewarded for things like that.""

**Season Series:** This is the rubber match of the three-game season series between the Pittsburgh and Winnipeg and the first game at Consol Energy Center. The Jets won the first meeting, 4-2, on Jan. 25; the Penguins won the second meeting, 3-1, on Feb. 15. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Pittsburgh has won 13 straight while dealing with key injuries to Kris Letang and Evgeni Malkin. Marc-Andre Fleury is on that list now, too.

Fleury was injured in a 1-0 win over the Montreal Canadiens on Tuesday and had to leave the game. He's still being evaluated, but he likely will not start Thursday night.

Letang returned to the lineup Tuesday after missing three games, but he's out again, back on injured reserve because of a broken toe. The Penguins recalled Simon Despres to fill Letang's spot on the roster.

Malkin, who hasn't played since March 9 because of an upper-body injury, is still considered day-to-day. He's been skating with the team and it's possible he gets back in the lineup Thursday against the Jets.

Regardless of all the injuries, Pittsburgh will welcome a new addition to the lineup Thursday as Murray is expected to make his Penguins' debut. He arrived in Pittsburgh on Tuesday after being traded to the Penguins on Monday.

""He's going to bring a lot,"" captain Sidney Crosby said.


















**Jets:**  They've won two straight since losing back-to-back games to the Washington Capitals by a combined 10-1 score.

Winnipeg has taken a six-point lead in the Southeast Division and is on its way to securing at least the third seed in the Eastern Conference.

""We're trying to forget about that Washington mini-series as much as possible,"" Evander Kane told reporters following the Jets 4-1 win over the Carolina Hurricanes on Tuesday. ""I think we've responded here in these last two games real well. We knew we couldn't dwell on what happened with Washington and we needed to move on and move forward.""
Kane broke a three-game pointless drought with a goal and three assists to pace the Jets in Carolina. Nik Antropov,Tobias Enstrom and Olli Jokinen also scored for the Jets against the Hurricanes. Enstrom has goals in back-to-back games.









__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Kane will look to build on his four-point night in Carolina, where Jets goalie Ondrej Pavelec stopped 38 of 39 shots. He has allowed only three goals against 64 shots in the past two games. … Crosby continues to pace the Penguins. He scored the lone goal in the win over the Canadiens and has nine points over a five-game point-scoring streak. He leads Steven Stamkos by 11 points in the NHL's scoring race. 

**Injury Report:** Jets defensemen Mark Stuart (undisclosed) and Zach Redmond (thigh) as well as forwards Jim Slater(upper body) and Anthony Peluso (hand) have been out of the lineup. … The Penguins will be without Letang (broken toe). Fleury (sore neck) and Malkin are questionable.

**Season Series:** This is the second of three meetings. The Carolina Hurricanes earned a 4-1 victory against thePittsburgh Penguins on Feb. 28 at PNC Arena. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:** Pittsburgh is coming off a split of a home-and-home series against the New York Rangers. After getting blown out in a 6-1 loss at Madison Square Garden last Wednesday, the Pens responded with a 2-1 shootout victory at the Consol Energy Center two nights later.

Pittsburgh enters Tuesday’s action three points ahead of the Montreal Canadiens for the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. The Penguins officially clinched a spot in the Stanley Cup Playoffs on Sunday, even though they were idle.

“It’s always nice to have the X get put up there and know you’re going to the postseason, I don’t know if we’ve had it this early the last couple years,” coach Dan Bylsma told the team’s website. “But it’s the first step. It’s certainly something we had our mind on and goals on, but it’s just the first step. We’re looking at these nine games with this group as a lot of areas to get better.

“Certainly just getting into the playoffs is not our goal. (Our goal) is not where we want to finish at the end of the regular season, so still have a significant amount of work to do. But when I see the X in the standings, that’s a good thing.”



















**Hurricanes:**  Carolina’s playoff chances are in serious jeopardy. The Hurricanes are winless this month, as they dropped their fifth straight game Monday in a 6-2 loss to the Boston Bruins at TD Garden.

“I just think we have to take the positives,"" forward Jeff Skinner said. ""There are a lot of good things in our game. There are some things that we could have done better, but you can't do anything about it now. So, just try to move on and move forward and get ready for the game tomorrow.""











__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Pens forward Chris Kunitz has a goal and three assists in the past five games, while Pascal Dupuis is 3-1-4 in the past five. 

**Injury Report:** Besides Crosby, the Penguins are expected to be missing defensemen Paul Martin (hand) and Kris Letang (lower body). … Hurricanes forward Alexander Semin sat out again Monday with an upper-body injury and remains questionable. He’s on an injured list that also features goaltender Cam Ward and defenseman Justin Faulk, who are both out with knee injuries. Joni Pitkanen (heel) is also out.

**Player Bio:**


Born on December 6th 1986 in Virginia Minnesota, Matt Niskanen is currently a defenseman for the Pittsburgh Penguins, coming in the trade that brought James Neal from Dallas.  Early in his career Niskanen helped his high school team, the Virginia/Mountain Iron-Buhl Blue Devil’s to their first state high school tournament appearance.  He was then drafted 28th overall by the Dallas Stars in the 2005 NHL Entry Draft and played for two years in the WCHA (Western Collegiate Hockey Association) totaling 45 (10G 35A) points in 77 games with the Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs, and being named All WCHA First team in the 2006-2007 season.  After his sophomore year Niskanen decided to leave college and begin his professional career, signing an amateur try-out contract with the Iowa Stars on March 17th 2007, he would go on to sign a three-year contract with the Dallas Stars at the beginning on the 2007-2008 season and make the roster out of training camp.  Over the next four seasons Niskanen would play in 277 regular season games with the Stars, collecting 79 points (16G 63A) and an overall +/- of -5.  Most Pens fans probably remember his time with the Stars for when he fought Sidney Crosby during a game in Dallas on November 3rd 2010. [Link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXhwSyTQS2M)  Since coming to the Pens in a trade, Niskanen’s time in Pittsburgh has been fairly standard for a d-man of his talent level, gaining 39 (5G 34A) points in 133 Regular season games, and 6 (1G 5A) points in 26 Playoff games.

**Benefit to team:**

Trying to write down what Niskanen brings to the table is kind of difficult.  I’m not saying he’s a bad player by any means but I have trouble remembering specific times where he stood out, meaning his play has been fairly mediocre during his time in Pittsburgh.  While he does add some offensive power from the blue line he’s not particularly large, and doesn’t take up too much space in front of the net, and he’s also prone to making costly mistakes that can lead to offensive opportunities for the opposing team.  I will admit that he cut down on those mistakes during this past shortened season, but I find myself asking if he is really worth the 2.3m cap hit.  Next season the top 4 D-men will be Letang/Martin/Orpik/Scuderi, leaving only two spots for Niskanen/Engallend/Depres/Bortuzzo, while Niskanen is without a doubt the top option for the bottom pairing he is the most expensive of the three by far; and seeing as how Despres and Bortuzzo were both re-signed this off-season Niskanen’s future seems in doubt.  Couple his inconsistent play with the Pens current cap issues I would not be terribly surprised to see him traded during this upcoming season, and even if he does stay the entire season I don’t see any way Shero can feasibly bring him back unless he takes a major pay cut.


**A couple highlights:**

[Goal vs. WSH](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL6Bdjca5y0)

[Big hit on Jonathan Haberdeau](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDYntlI97IE)


**Closing Thoughts:**

Overall he wasn’t a bad acquisition as he was pretty much brought in to fill the hole when Goligoski left, but a few issues make me believe that we won’t be seeing too much more of Nisky in Pittsburgh.


/u/terotheterror would like to remind everyone that we still have a couple players available, so please take a look at the 30days/30players thread and send him a PM if you can take any of them.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Both teams had semi-unexpected results in their Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series. The top-seeded Penguins struggled with the eighth-seeded New York Islanders more than most people expected, coming within a goal of having to play seven games. Meanwhile, the seventh-seeded Senators dispatched of the second-seeded Montreal Canadiens with relative ease, cruising to a five-game series win. These teams were the only ones to average four goals per game or more during the first round, and each has the offensive personnel to create fireworks in this conference semifinal. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; The big question in Pittsburgh for the remainder of the playoffs figures to center around the goaltending.Tomas Vokoun allowed three goals on 69 shots over the final two games to stabilize the position after Marc-Andre Fleury's struggles in Games 2 through 4 threatened to derail the Penguins' anticipated run deep into the postseason. However, Fleury is the far more accomplished playoff goalie, with 40 more wins than Vokoun and a Stanley Cup on his resume.

&gt; Offensively, there's no reason to worry about the Penguins -- even Brooks Orpik is providing timely goals. The big concern is whether the defense and whoever's in net can do a better job than the Canadiens did of stopping a Senators attack that is quite proficient itself.

&gt; ""We have confidence in both guys, no matter who it is,"" captain Sidney Crosby said. ""They've both proven for a long time that they're more than capable of doing a great job. We feel very comfortable with either one as players, but it's not up to us to decide who goes into net.""











**Senators:**

&gt; With this series the first of the conference semifinals to get under way, Ottawa will have had four days off since Game 5 against Montreal -- enough time to rest some bumps and bruises created by a physical series, but not so much where it should create rust in the Senators' game.

&gt; And that's important, because the Senators clicked on all cylinders against the Canadiens -- starting in net, where Craig Anderson flashed the form that made him an early candidate for the Vezina Trophy. Daniel Alfredsson turned back the clock, posting six points to tie with Karlsson for the team lead, and late-season call-up Jean-Gabriel Pageau had a Game 3 hat trick.

&gt; ""Opportunity, that's what every single team has here in the second round,"" forward Colin Greening told the Ottawa Citizen. ""If you watch the games, you see that teams are peaking at this time of year and it's the best time to peak. Whether you're third seed or fourth seed or whatever seed you are, that doesn't matter. All that matters is that you're playing at this time of year.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ottawa forward Jason Spezza is the wild card in this series -- he's been skating with the team and testing out his back after surgery for a herniated disk limited him to just five games in January. There's speculation Spezza could play in this series, though both he and coach Paul MacLean have tried to temper any expectations, and Spezza didn't travel with the team to Pittsburgh. Defenseman Patrick Wiercioch is day-to-day after missing the final two games of the Montreal series with a lower-body injury. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Kyle Turris has goals in three consecutive games for the Senators. Cory Conacher scored the tying goal in Game 4 against the Canadiens, then added two goals in the clinching Game 5. Anderson posted a .950 save percentage in the first round. … Evgeni Malkin (2-9-11), Jarome Iginla (2-7-9) and Pascal Dupuis (5-2-7) all have six-game points streaks for the Penguins to start the postseason. Crosby was on the score sheet in all five games he played, notching three goals and six assists.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; The Pittsburgh Penguins will have a new look between the pipes for Game 5 of this Eastern Conference Quarterfinal series against the New York Islanders.

&gt; Penguins coach Dan Bylsma announced Wednesday that Marc-Andre Fleury, who started the first four games and has been the club’s No. 1 goaltender since 2005, will be replaced by Tomas Vokoun. Fleury has a 3.40 goals-against average and an. 891 save percentage in the series and allowed six goals on 24 shots in Tuesday’s 6-4 loss at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum.

&gt; Vokoun went 3-0 with a 0.90 goals-against average, a .970 save percentage and one shutout against the Islanders during the regular season.

&gt; ""We brought Tomas Vokoun in to play big games for us,"" Bylsma said. ""He has done that this year for us and he has been very good in the three games he has played against the Islanders.""

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Pittsburgh was picked as a Stanley Cup favorite prior to the start of the season, and that only intensified at the NHL Trade Deadline, when general manager Ray Shero acquired Jarome Iginla, Brenden Morrow and Douglas Murray in separate deals.

&gt; As the top seed in the East, the Penguins were expected to make quick work of the Islanders, who entered this first-round series with only 10 players on the roster with prior NHL postseason experience (one is Radek Martinek, who has yet to make an appearance in this series). But these Pens find themselves in a dogfight after dropping Game 4, and they must win two of the next three just to advance to the second round.

&gt; The good news is, Game 5 is back in Pittsburgh. Should the series require a seventh game, that too would be played at Consol Energy Center.

&gt; “With all the expectations that we have and with the way things have been going, even after Game 1 I think everyone expected it to be an easy series,” Pens defenseman Paul Martin said Wednesday. “It’s something that we as players definitely didn’t. Obviously, we haven’t played our best hockey yet. But we can’t change anything about what’s happened already. Our focus moving forward is the preparation and getting ready for this next game.

&gt; “It’s a best-out-of-3 now. We’re confident in the group that we have. We just have to make sure that we’re playing better.”









**Islanders:**

&gt; It hardly mattered to the Islanders that few thought they would even qualify for the Stanley Cup Playoffs. It mattered even less when most “experts” picked them to lose this best-of-7 series to the No. 1 Penguins in no more than five games.

&gt; All that matters is that they believe in themselves. That belief – not to mention there’s more talent on the roster than most give them credit for – is why this series became a best-of-3 when they earned a 6-4 victory on home ice in Game 4.

&gt; “The last three games have been really good, especially our 5-on-5 play,” Isles winger Colin McDonald said. “Just continue to get pucks in and just play physical and get pucks to the net … really just play a simple game. We’re just a gritty team. We have skilled guys, but I think we play our best when we all play the same way, and that’s just playing simple.”

### Injury Report:

&gt; Isles defenseman Andrew MacDonald is out after suffering an upper-body injury in the second period of Game 4. He will likely be replaced by Radek Martinek or Thomas Hickey. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Isles center John Tavares has two goals and two assists in the past three games, while center Casey Cizikas had a goal and two assists in Game 4 and is 2-2-4 in the series. Captain Mark Streit leads the club with five points (two goals, three assists). … Penguins center Evgeni Malkin has eight points (two goals, six assists) in the series, Iginla is 1-6-7 and captain Sidney Crosby is 2-4-6. Pascal Dupuis has four goals in as many games.

I live in England and I’ve been a Penguins fan for about the last four and half years. Living over here I don’t have any affiliation with any particular US or Canadian city. Way back in about 1998 I owned a Penguins jersey, but that was more because I liked it, rather than having much idea about the team or the sport. I started to get into hockey around 2008 when I became disillusioned with our football (soccer) and needed another sport to get my teeth into. About this time a friend of mine was living in Boston and I figured the Bruins were as good a team as any to hang my hat on. As I followed the games and players I couldn’t shake the feeling that Boston was not a likeable franchise and I couldn’t feel any affection for them whatsoever. So, instead I went in search of my true love. Maybe it was that shirt from 10 years before that lit a fire, but by the time Christmas 2008 arrived I was well in the Penguins camp. It was during the slump a couple of months prior to Dan Bylsma being installed as interim coach, but perhaps I picked a bad year because they would go on to win the cup and I could be labelled as a glory supporter. That said, I was still there for the first round exits the last two years and living in England I’ve begun plenty of work days with less than 3 hours sleep and bloodshot eyes to make up for it. I guess this was a long way around to get to my point, but earlier today I was reading the news on the excellent thepensblog.com and more specifically the tweets and media coverage that was coming out of Boston. It made me realise a couple of things. 1) It truly was a fantastic decision to turn my back on the Bruins. And 2) Despite not living in Pittsburgh, or being a Pennsylvanian native of any kind, reading their shit has never made me as proud as I am today to call myself a Penguins fan. Let’s go PENS!

**Season Series:**  Fifth and final meeting of the regular season between these Atlantic Division rivals. The Islanders won the opening matchup, but the Penguins have taken the next three. Sidney Crosby has nine points -- all assists -- to lead both teams in scoring. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Is this the day Jarome Iginla makes his Pittsburgh debut? That seemed questionable in the 24 hours leading up, as Iginla was still dealing with immigration issues following his trade from Calgary, but the Penguins are loaded regardless of when the future Hall of Famer arrives in town. They got Evgeni Malkin back from injury Thursday and cruised past the Jets, 4-0, with veteran goalie Tomas Vokoun registering his 50th career shutout. Showing their tremendous depth, the Pens received a pair of goals from Pascal Dupuis, giving him 17 in just 35 games this season.

""We have great players -- and even the great players understand what we need to do to win,"" Vokoun said. ""Sometimes that's even more important than having them.""



















**Islanders:**  Coupled with the rival Rangers being shut out in Ottawa, the Islanders' 4-3 shootout victory in Philadelphia on Thursday tied the clubs with 35 points -- the Blueshirts hold down eighth as a result of having played one fewer game. Having already lost 7-0 to the Flyers this season and given up the first two goals of the rematch, the Isles showed pluck in coming back. John Tavares scored in the final minute of the second period, Colin McDonald tallied twice in the third, and after a late Scott Hartnell goal for the Flyers forced extra time, Josh Bailey connected in the fourth round of the penalty-shot tiebreaker.

""We need the two points in any way shape or form, so we'll take it and try to build from it,"" Tavares said. ""We started slow, but every line contributed and we battled back. We finished checks, created opportunities down low and it feels good to get this one here.""










__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Tavares has goals in three consecutive games for the Islanders, and his 21 for the season place him second only to Steven Stamkos. Evgeni Nabokov has stopped 69 of 74 shots (.932 save percentage) during a personal three-game winning streak. … Crosby has three goals and six assists during a six-game points streak for the Penguins. Vokoun has won six straight decisions and stopped 133 of 137 shots (.971 save percentage) over his past six outings. 

**Injury Report:** New York forward David Ullstrom (groin) is on injured reserve. … Pittsburgh goalie Marc-Andre Fleury left Tuesday's game against Montreal with a sore neck after a goalmouth collision and didn't dress Thursday. He's day-to-day, but did practice Friday. Defenseman Kris Letang (lower body) is on injured reserve.

**Season Series:** It’s the first meeting between the teams. They’ll see each other twice in the next six days.
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Not much is new in Pittsburgh, as the Pens are on a five-game winning streak and putting up big numbers on a nightly basis. After a quiet night in Toronto, Kunitz had a career-high five points against the Isles. His linemate, Crosby, tied a career high with five assists on the night.

It will be a tall order when Crosby goes up against Bruins defenseman Zdeno Chara. With Evgeni Malkin (upper body) out of the lineup, Chara will focus much of his energy on containing Crosby’s line. The combination of Crosby, Kunitz and Pascal Dupuis is one of the top lines in hockey, and the only one to have each forward boast 10 or more goals. Add James Neal to the mix, and the Pens have four double-digit scorers.











**Bruins:**  Boston got off to a slow start against Ottawa on Monday, but rallied back to eventually top the Sens in a shootout, 3-2. It was a physical game at Scotiabank Place – one that cost the Bruins forward Chris Kelly early in the second period. After the game, coach Claude Julien addressed the injury.

“He’s been looked at, but we’re going to bring him with us to Pittsburgh. We’ll see how things pan out.”

Boston may have one of the toughest defenses in the NHL, but they will need to recover quickly if they hope to contain the Pens’ high-octane offense.

e to get back to the way we were playing on the road -- to get back into that mindset and how we've been successful.""









__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Fresh off being named the National Hockey League’s second star of the week, Crosby put up 11 points in four games and sits on top the League’s point-leader board. 

**Injury Report:** Malkin is expected to miss 1-2 weeks. … The Bruins will likely be playing without Kelly after Monday’s collision.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; In the previous round, the Chicago Blackhawks faced a 3-1 series deficit against the Detroit Red Wings before rallying to advance; now the NHL's other dominant team during the regular season, the Pittsburgh Penguins, finds its back against the wall after losing the first two games of the Eastern Conference Final on home ice. The Boston Bruins chased Tomas Vokoun from Game 2 and further muddled the Penguins' goaltending situation. Back home for a pair of games at TD Garden, they'll attempt to turn what most experts predicted as a six- or seven-game series into something much shorter. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; When Pittsburgh coach Dan Bylsma turned to Vokoun for Game 5 against the New York Islanders in the first round, it might have been with the mindset of giving struggling starter Marc-Andre Fleury a quick breather. But Vokoun shut out the Islanders that night and went on a run of six wins in seven games, making it impossible for Bylsma to go back to the man who led his team to the Stanley Cup four years ago. 

&gt; Vokoun couldn't be faulted much for Pittsburgh's 3-0 loss to Boston in Game 1, but after he gave up three goals on 12 shots in the first period Monday, the move was made, and Fleury was back in the crease. The Penguins seemed to seize momentum when Brandon Sutter scored with 34 seconds left in the first, but Fleury allowed a goal 25 seconds later by Brad Marchand on the first shot he faced. Fleury ended up stopping 14 of 17 shots and it's questionable whether he showed Bylsma enough to earn the Game 3 start in what will be hostile territory.

&gt; ""It's not a feeling where we want to be, but we have a lot of experience in the room and I know a lot of the guys have been down and won a series before,"" Fleury said. ""So we'll just put those two behind us and make sure we get back to our game.













**Bruins:**

&gt; Following the morning skate prior to Game 2, Boston coach Claude Julien and many of his players spoke to how the Bruins would need to improve on the effort that produced a 3-0 win in the series opener if they wanted to take a two-game lead back home with them. From the drop of the opening faceoff, which led to Marchand's first of two goals 28 seconds in, they did just that.

&gt; The Bruins were all over the Penguins at both ends of the ice, adding goals by the red-hot duo of Nathan Horton and David Krejci to chase Vokoun. After giving up a goal in the final minute of the first that looked like it could change momentum, Marchand got it right back. Goaltender Tuukka Rask followed a flawless Game 1 performance with a 26-save win. The Bruins have won seven of eight since nearly blowing a 3-1 series lead to the Toronto Maple Leafs in the first round.

&gt; ""We pretty much dominated that game,"" Rask said. ""Our defense was really good not giving them too many scoring chances at all.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; It's expected Boston defenseman Wade Redden, who hasn't played since suffering an upper-body injury in the first round, could play if the Bruins needed him, but the return to health of Dennis Seidenberg and Andrew Ference coupled with the emergence of rookie Torey Krug makes that an unlikely scenario. 

---

**Big Story:**  

&gt; For as much trouble as the New York Islanders gave them in the first round, the Pittsburgh Penguins never trailed in that series, and they made sure to get off on the right foot again in the second round with a convincing 4-1 victory in Game 1 over the Ottawa Senators, who got a rude awakening that they're now facing a team with a few more weapons than the Montreal Canadiens. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; There was plenty of talk in between rounds about whether coach Dan Bylsma might go back to Marc-Andre Fleury against Ottawa, but he stuck with Tomas Vokoun in Game 1 and was rewarded with a 35-save effort from the veteran netminder. It left little doubt that unless Vokoun starts to struggle, he'll be the No. 1 going forward in these playoffs.


&gt; Evgeni Malkin, who leads the NHL this postseason in assists, added another on Paul Martin's power-play goal to start the scoring on Tuesday, then tied David Krejci of the Boston Bruins for the lead in points with 13 when he potted the game-winning goal at 12:15 of the first. Chris Kunitz added a power-play goal in addition to Dupuis' shorthanded tally to cap the offense.


&gt; ""We are way more near where we need to be [in Game 1],"" Bylsma said. ""We got the puck deep, got on the forecheck, and we were able to get in the offensive zone because of that.


&gt; ""Tonight was a much better indication of where we need to play 5-on-5."" 











**Senators:**

&gt; Some of the pluck Ottawa showed in its five-game elimination of Montreal was present Tuesday in the series opener, like when the Senators responded to the Penguins scoring their opening goal by coming right back to tie it up just over two minutes later on a great effort by Colin Greening.


&gt; For the night they put 36 shots on goal and generated their fair share of scoring chances, but specialty teams did the Senators in -- they allowed a pair of power-play goals to the Penguins, then surrendered a shorthanded goal in the third period by Pascal Dupuis during a critical stretch when they could have rallied to within one.


&gt; ""They played a little bit better than we did today, and we've got to come out better next game and be more prepared,"" defenseman Erik Karlsson said. ""They scored an early goal on us and set us back a bit. Need to just keep improving for every game and we know it's going to be harder and harder.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; Ottawa defenseman Eric Gryba left Game 1 with an upper-body injury and is day-to-day. Defenseman Patrick Wiercioch (lower body) has been out since Game 3 of the Montreal series. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Erik Condra set up Greening's goal with a shot Vokoun had trouble handling; Condra finished the previous series for the Senators with a three-point Game 5 effort. … Malkin (3-10-13), Jarome Iginla (2-8-10) and Dupuis (6-2-8) all extended their points streaks to seven games for the Penguins. Martin has goals in consecutive games. Vokoun has a 1.28 goals-against average and .962 save percentage in three starts.

New Career High!!! Had 49 pts in both his 3rd and 4th seasons, but never hit 50. Also, he had played all 82 games in those seasons. This season he hit 50 pts in only 62 games!!

**Chris Kunitz** - Scored and added an assist for a total of 61 pts this season. Also a new career high for him. He had 60 pts a few years back with the Ducks.

**Pascal Dupuis** - Big big year for Duper. He set a new career high for himself in goals, assists and points. In 2002-03 he was 20-28-48 with the Wild. This year 25-34-59. Excellent  job!!

**MATT COOKE** - Played his 82nd game of the season. This means he didn't receive a single suspension all year! What a turn around. AND he had a new career high in goals with 19, falling just short of the goal plateau. 

**Sidney Crosby** - After missing 41 games last year, the first 20 this year, playing 8, being out for another 40, Sid ended up with 37pts in 22 games. That's 1.68 Pts/G.

**Brooks Orpik** - A personal best for Orpik this year, finishing the season at +19, just 2 behind team leader Kris Letang at +21. 

**Evgeni Malkin** - Of course the one everyone will focus on, understandbly. Scored his 50th goal of the season for the first time in his career. And unless Stamkos comes up with a big 13-point night against Winnipeg, Malkin wins the  Art Ross Trophy again.

**Marc-Andre Fleury** - Fleury finished with 42 Wins on the season, which is not only the highest in his career, but ties him with Tom Barasso for most wins in franchise history with 226 and also tied for the franchise record in Shutouts with 22.

Congrats to all these guys for brilliant performances this season!!

***edit*** **James Neal** - How did I forget Neal (thanks BareFootEJ) with is 40G and 41A!!?? Also a career-year for him! Hopefully these last two games he missed were just to rest some soreness before the playoffs.

Guys, I'm a little excited. We're heading into the playoffs with basically a fully healthy line-up! This could be a really fun couple of months!",,False,self,t5_2r549,True,,66,True,t3_ryhlc,http://www.reddit.com/r/penguins/comments/ryhlc/and_the_important_thing_i_took_out_of_this_game/,

**Big Story:** After rallying for a 4-3 victory in Game 2 to earn a split of the first two games, the New York Islanders will host their first home playoff game since 2007. They haven't won a postseason game at the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum since 2002. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; After steamrolling the Islanders 5-0 in Game 1, the Pittsburgh Penguins got an extra boost for Game 2 with the return of captain Sidney Crosby, who hadn't played since suffering a broken jaw on a deflected shot against the Islanders on March 30. Consol Energy Center was roaring as Crosby scored twice in the first eight minutes to give the give the Penguins a 3-1 lead after the opening period. But they were unable to score again and allowed three unanswered goals to the Islanders.

&gt; Despite his superb return -- he was named the game's No. 2 star -- Crosby said he was feeling the effects of missing 13 games.

&gt; ""All right,"" he said after a slight hesitation when asked how he felt. ""I think that there's definitely a little bit of rust. But there's not a lot of time, so I've got to find a way to create things out there and be better.""

&gt; With the quick turnaround, Crosby said the Penguins can't think about blowing a lead in a game that could have put the inexperienced Islanders in a huge hole.

&gt; ""It's the playoffs. You lose games sometimes,"" he said. ""We have to make sure we learn pretty quickly from this one, though. It's not the way we want to play, and we definitely have room to improve.""








**Islanders:**

&gt; The scared, nervous team that was overwhelmed by the Penguins in Game 1 was nowhere to be found Friday night. Even while falling behind 3-1, the Islanders kept pushing the tempo and attacking the net, making the Penguins play defense. New York finished with 42 shots and used a couple of fortuitous bounces off the end boards to overtake the Penguins and even the series. Kyle Okposo's game-winner came on a shot from the slot that missed the net but caromed off the end boards into the crease, where it deflected off goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury and into the net.

&gt; It was the sixth time in 26 road games this season in which the Islanders won after trailing by two goals.

&gt; ""We've had a few wins like that, where we had a slow start and battled back,"" said center John Tavares, who had an assist in Game 2 and was a factor all night long. ""That's been the story of our season. We had a great second half of the game. We really brought it, and found a way to get it done. That was a big win for us, and we're looking forward to getting back home in front of our fans.""


&gt; The Islanders appeared to relax after falling behind in Game 2 -- they just went out and played. It's a formula they need to continue on Sunday.


&gt; ""We have to keep things loose and have fun,"" defenseman Andrew MacDonald said after Saturday's practice. ""We're trying to enjoy this as much as we can.""

### Injury Report:

&gt; Pittsburgh played Game 2 without all-star forward James Neal, who went out with a lower-body injury in the opener, and defenseman Brooks Orpik, who hasn't played in the series due to a lower-body injury. Neal skated briefly at practice Saturday before leaving early; Orpik and center Evgeni Malkin did not skate at all … The Islanders report no injuries. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt;  Crosby had a pair of goals Friday, giving him 22 goals and 77 points in 42 games (regular-season and playoffs) against the Islanders. … Islanders goaltender Evgeni Nabokov stopped the last 25 shots he faced in Game 2 after allowing three goals on Pittsburgh's first eight shots.

**Season Series:** It’s the second of three meetings. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:** The Penguins lost captain Sidney Crosby on Saturday, after he got hit with a shot that broke his jaw. How long he will be out remains to be seen, but it’s up to the Pens to continue to march on without him in the meantime.

""Obviously, it's a huge loss and the way Sid's been playing has been unbelievable,"" teammate James Neal said. ""Losing him stinks, but at the same time we've got some good depth on this team and that gives a chance for some guys to step up, and definitely for some new guys we just acquired to step up.”

In previous years, the Penguins have been able to continue their winning ways without Crosby, but obviously would rather have the star center on the ice. What’s different about this season is Ray Shero’s acquisitions of Brenden Morrow, Douglas Murray and Iginla.




















**Sabres:**  Don’t count the Sabres out of the playoff picture just yet. Although they sit 13th in the conference, Buffalo is only five points back of the eighth-place New York Rangers. However, there is not much room for error if they plan on making it.

The Sabres were held off the scoreboard against the Bruins on Sunday, but they played a solid 60 minutes. Ryan Miller hasn’t been as brilliant of late, but he also hasn’t had much help. The team’s leading scorer, Thomas Vanek has been sidelined with an injury and they are struggling to replace his points. Buffalo’s defense is also sitting towards the bottom of the NHL, currently ranked 25th with a goals-against average of 3.00.

In addition to the current adversaries the Sabres are facing, the Penguins seem to have had Miller’s number for quite some time. In 19 career games against Pittsburgh, Miller is 5-11-3 with a 3.44 GAA and .881 save percentage. Numbers that don’t really reflect the silver medalist’s usual stellar play.










__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Pittsburgh goaltender Tomas Vokoun has recorded back-to-back shutouts. 

**Injury Report:** Crosby (broken jaw) and Paul Martin (broken hand) join Kris Letang, who is sidelined with a lower-body injury. … Vanek and Ville Leino are both suffering from upper-body injuries for the Sabres. They will also be without Corey Trop (knee) and Alexander Sulzer (lower body).

**Last 10:**  Pittsburgh 8-2-0, Ottawa 4-6-0 

**Season Series:** This is the third of three meetings. The Pittsburgh Penguins took the first two games and will be looking to sweep the Ottawa Senators on Monday at Scotiabank Place. 

---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; After clinching the top spot in the Eastern Conference on Saturday, the Penguins will most likely turn their attention to getting healthy for the playoffs. That should be somewhat tricky going into Ottawa, an organization that was very vocal about the Erik Karlsson injury that took place in Pittsburgh on Feb. 13. Some members of the Senators’ organization thought Matt Cooke targeted Karlsson and wanted him suspended.

&gt; Penguins coach Dan Bylsma took a different approach to addressing the situation. When asked if he expects shenanigans in Ottawa, coach Bylsma replied, “I’m not aware they’re dressing Shenanigans … I don’t know what number he would be or what kind of player he would be.”

&gt; The Penguins have recalled enforcer Steve MacIntyre from its American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and could possibly dress him for the game, although Bylsma didn’t say if he would.

&gt; Depending on how the season finishes, these teams could be a first round match-up, potentially leading to a very physical series.




**Senators:**

&gt; Like Pittsburgh, Ottawa has had a difficult season with injuries to key players. Although Jason Spezza is still out after back surgery, the Sens had Milan Michalek and Craig Anderson return to the lineup and Karlsson is close to returning.
&gt; Ottawa is currently one point behind the Islanders for the sixth seed in the East, but it also has a game in hand. Toronto, Winnipeg, the New York Rangers, Washington and the Islanders are all competing to make the playoffs with only four spots remaining.

&gt; After a devastating 4-1 loss to Toronto on Saturday, the Senators don’t have much room for error. With three of their last four games against the top three teams in the East, it will be a difficult task to gain every point they can.

### Injury Report:

&gt; Sidney Crosby (broken jaw), James Neal (concussion), Paul Martin (hand surgery), and Evgeni Malkin(upper body) will not play. Kris Letang (illness) is a game-time decision for Pittsburgh. … Mike Hoffman (collarbone) and Spezza (back surgery) will not play for the Sens. Karlsson (achilles laceration) is a game-time decision. 

---

### Who´s Hot: 

&gt; Before Saturday’s win in Boston, Pens forward Pascal Dupuis was on a six-game point streak with 10 points (three goals, seven assists). 


---

### Trivia:

&gt; The Penguins are 21 – 3 - 0 against playoff teams this year and 9 – 0 against seeds two through four. In comparison, the Blackhawks are 14 – 3 - 4 against playoff teams.

&gt; If the Penguins win tonight, Dan Bylsma becomes the fastest coach ever in the NHL to reach 200 wins.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; Any hopes the Ottawa Senators have of getting back into this Eastern Conference Semifinal series will hinge on their performance in Game 3 against the Pittsburgh Penguins. After dropping the first two games of the series in Pittsburgh, Ottawa will need to take advantage of the series shifting to Scotiabank Place. The last time they dropped the first two games in a series to Pittsburgh, they were swept out of the first round of the 2008 Stanley Cup Playoffs.

&gt; Senators forward Jason Spezza practiced Saturday without a no-contact jersey and is expected to play. He was limited to five games this season with a back injury.



---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**
&gt; It didn't take long for center Sidney Crosby to make his mark on Game 2 of the series. The Penguins captain walked past Senators defenseman Erik Karlsson and beat goalie Craig Anderson to open the scoring. Kyle Turris would reply for Ottawa 10 minutes later, but Crosby would score twice more, completing his hat trick on the power play 1:15 into the second period. The goal would end the night for Anderson, who was pulled and replaced byRobin Lehner.

&gt; Ottawa would continue to battle back throughout the game, but Brenden Morrow's second-period deflection would prove to be the game-winner in a 4-3 victory. Pittsburgh never trailed in the matchup and outshot the Senators 42-22. But the Penguins needed some big stops from goaltender Tomas Vokoun to secure the win.

&gt; ""Right from the drop of the puck we came out and had some great chances, some good pressure,"" Penguins forward Jarome Iginla said. ""I thought not just this game, but our first two games were good overall games.""










**Senators:**

&gt; The final score may have been close in Game 2, but the Penguins have created some serious problems for the Senators through two games. For one thing, Ottawa has not led at any point in the series. It's also failed to contain Pittsburgh's star players or a dominating Penguins power play which has scored three times in 10 opportunities.

&gt; Perhaps most worrisome for Ottawa is the play of Anderson. After appearing unbeatable in the opening round against the Montreal Canadiens, he has allowed seven goals on 51 shots in two games for a save percentage of .863. His early exit Friday marked the only time all season he's been removed for performance reasons. If they want to get back into the series, the Senators will need to improve in numerous areas, starting from their net on out.

&gt; They'll surely benefit from the return of Spezza. The all-star confirmed Saturday he would be back for Game 3.

&gt; ""The obvious challenge is the speed of the game and hopping right into the playoffs isn't easy,"" Spezza said. ""I've put in the work. It's been a long time coming and I hope the excitement can kind of help me get through to get things back as quick as possible.""

**TV:** RDS, ROOT-PIT 

**Season Series:** This will be the second of three meetings. The first match was a wild 7-6 overtime win for the Pens, which turned out to be the start of their current 12-game win streak.  
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  The longest winning streak this season and first place in the East wasn’t enough for Pens general manager Ray Shero, who added some grit to the lineup. Likely making their debuts Tuesday night, Douglas Murray and Morrow add even more depth to this outstanding Pittsburgh team.

It should be interesting to see what Pens coach Dan Bylsma does with the lineup card against the Habs. With Evgeni Malkin close to being back, most are expecting him to center a line with James Neal and Morrow.

Morrow’s leadership and skills on Malkin’s line would be the perfect compliment to Sidney Crosby’s line, giving the Pens a lethal one-two punch.


















**Canadiens:**  Montreal coach Michel Therrien will be behind the bench in Pittsburgh for the first time since he was relieved of his duties in February of 2009. Therrien’s Canadiens are nipping at the heels of the Pens for first place in the Eastern Conference. Montreal is five points back, but has two games at hand.

The Habs are coming off a tough 2-1 loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Saturday night, but that won’t distract them from the task at hand.

“They have a lot of world class players so obviously we have to do make sure we’re doing the right things,” defenseman P.K Subban said. “Putting pucks in the right places and making sure we’re coming back to the house hard and helping out our goaltender.”

Montreal goalie Carey Price will surely appreciate the extra help around the net against the League’s highest-scoring team. In his last four starts against the Penguins, Price is 1-1-2 with a 3.90 goals-against average.









__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury, who leads all goalies in wins, has put up a 0.74 GAA in his last four starts. 

**Injury Report:** Kris Letang and Malkin will be game-time decisions for the Penguins. The Habs will be without Rene Bourque and Raphael Diaz, both recovering from concussions, and Brandon Prust is still out with a shoulder injury.

* [Article from penguins.nhl.com](http://penguins.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=662939&amp;cmpid=pit-twt-penguins) about the surgery (this pretty much just restates the tweet above)

Personally, I started watching during our 2009 Cup run. I was never really into hockey, but I was a Steelers fan from birth, so naturally I love all the Pittsburgh teams. My brother was dating a girl who watched hockey all the time, so my whole family began watching. I knew Crosby already, but started really looking into the team. I loved Scuderi because of his last name, but once I got more into the game, I liked his talent too, so I'm glad he is back. After winning the Cup, I continued following hockey and have been a fan ever since. I finally went to a game last season against the Flyers, and went this season against the Islanders when Vokoun shut the Isles down. It really became more of my favorite sport as I watched more.

**Season Series:** This is the second of three meetings. The teams played here Tuesday, with Pittsburgh getting a 3-2 win, scoring three times in the third period after trailing 2-0 in the first. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Pittsburgh's methodical climb to the top of the Eastern Conference was built on offensive production spurred by Sidney Crosby and Chris Kunitz. Saturday against the Rangers, the Penguins got goals from Beau Bennett and Tyler Kennedy.

""When we go out there we try to do our best to play responsible (on defense) and then capitalize on our chances,"" Bennett told the team's website.

The shutout capped a run of four games in which the Penguins have allowed four goals, coinciding with the return of defenseman Mark Eaton six games ago.

""The stability at which he plays -- a stay-at-home defenseman, I'm not sure we have that definition on our team,"" coach Dan Bylsma said. ""Mark has been real stable back there -- defending, position-wise, has been excellent.""

Marc-Andre Fleury was barely tested making 23 saves for his franchise-record 23rd career shutout and could be given his first consecutive-days starts of the season.

""We all know how good [Fleury] is,"" forward Pascal Dupuis said. ""He doesn't need shutouts and records for us to know he's our go-to guy and the guy that we trust to win games.""

Bylsma would not rule out a return by forward Evgeni Malkin, who has missed three games with an upper-body injury unrelated to a concussion which cost him four games earlier this season.














**Bruins:**  After avenging its second-most-recent loss Saturday, Boston will look to reverse the result it suffered in Pittsburgh earlier in the week. The Bruins' home game Saturday was filled with emotion, with three separate fights.

""We'd like to bring this kind of game into tomorrow's game and get another 60-minute effort,"" coach Claude Julien told NESN. ""We can be a physical team, a resilient team, and hopefully we'll bring that to Pittsburgh tomorrow.""

Julien challenged the line of Nathan Horton, Milan Lucic and David Krejci to improve, and the forwards responded with two goals and seven assists Saturday, including Krejci's 300th career point.

""I like the way we played, but one game doesn't make the season,"" Krejci said. ""We know we have to play better tomorrow.""

The Bruins blocked 26 shots in the game Tuesday with backup Anton Khudobin in net. Tuukka Rask likely will start Sunday.






__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** The Bruins are 5-0-0 in day games this season. The line of Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand and Tyler Seguin has 29 points in eight March games, and is a combined plus-22. … Dupuis has seven goals in his past six games. Defenseman Kris Letang has 13 points in his past eight games. 

**Injury Report:** Malkin is the only injured Penguins player. … Bruins forward Chris Kelly (broken leg) is out.

## Player Summary

Born 30 December 1978 in Syosset, NY, he is once again playing defense for the Pittsburgh Penguins after signing a 4 year 3.375M/per contract this off-season.  Scuderi played for Boston College for 4 seasons (7G-61A) where he held the record for most games played at 169.  His final game with the Eagles was also their 1st NCAA D1 Championship win since 1949.

He was drafted shortly after his 1st college season, 134th overall (5th round), by the Penguins, and began his professional career in 2001 with the WBS Pens.  Over the next 2 season with the Baby Pens he would play 149 games, score 5 goals and tally 39 assists.  In 2003 he had his first shot at the big leagues, playing 13 games for the Pens.  During the lockout the following season he again played with WBS, before gaining a permanent spot on the NHL Pens in the 2005-2006 season.  Scuderi continued to play for the Pens up until the '09 cup win after which he signed a 4 year contract with the Los Angeles Kings.  Three years after winning a cup with the Pens, he won one with the Kings ('11-'12).

**Interesting Fact:** He's the first Long Island native to have his name engraved on the cup.

Scuderi is the kind of defenseman that the Pens were sorely missing last season, he was an important part of the '09 cup team (see: Game 6), and GMRS has mentioned that one of his biggest regrets as a GM was letting Scuds go as opposed to re-signing him after that season.  He is by no means a points guy, but more of a stay-at-home defenseman who can lay solid hits and keep the crease nice and empty.  His addition this off-season could be pivotal to the Penguins defensive success, and since he has already played with the Penguins it should be an easy transition.  He will almost certainly be one of the top 4 defensemen, and most speculate he will be paired with Letang, a positive since Letang is strong in the o-zone and weaker in the d-zone (the opposite of Scuderi).

## Highlights

* [Picking up some goalie slack and saving the cup run](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMcQLu_K_Xw) - sorry for the quality
* [Wonderful hip check on Zubrus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKGO0gJNyEo)

## Final Thoughts

I was excited when I heard we had signed Scuderi again, and unless something shocking happens between now and the season this will have been one of our best off-season acquisitions.  I really do think that if paired with Letang (or even Martin or Orpik) he will make a big difference, and really help to close up some of the glaring holes in our D.  Both this addition and the hiring of Martin will be pivotal in the 13/14 season.

**Big Story:**  

&gt; It's no secret the Pittsburgh Penguins have the type of offense that can erupt at any time and blow the opposition out of the water -- unfortunately for the Ottawa Senators, that moment arrived in the third period of Game 4. The Penguins turned an up-in-the-air 3-2 game into a 7-3 blowout, and now they have the chance to close out the Senators back at Consol Energy Center and punch their ticket to the Eastern Conference Finals. 


---

### Team Notes:

**Penguins:**

&gt; Frustrated by the goaltending of Craig Anderson in a failed attempt to take a 3-0 series lead Sunday, Pittsburgh chased him for the second time in three games. James Neal opened the third with his second goal of the night, then Pascal Dupuis and Sidney Crosby scored 31 seconds apart. Neal's goal came on a power play, and Dupuis scored shorthanded as the Penguins' special teams came up big down the stretch. Jarome Iginla added his second goal of the game on a power play after Robin Lehner came on in relief.

&gt; Goalie Tomas Vokoun won for the fifth time in six starts since taking over for Marc-Andre Fleury. Now the Penguins will try to avoid giving the Senators any life the way they did in Game 3 and earn themselves a little extra rest with a victory.

&gt; ""It was a tough one the other night to lose,"" Neal said. ""We came in here with a huge effort and got a chance to come back to our rink and close it out.""













**Senators:**

&gt; Throughout the Stanley Cup Playoffs, the third period had been owned by Ottawa. Three of the eight victories recorded by a team trailing after 40 minutes came courtesy of the Senators, so despite the Penguins carrying a one-goal lead into the third Wednesday there was plenty of optimism present at Scotiabank Place that the home team could pull off a rally similar to their Game 3 double-overtime win.

&gt; That went down in a flurry of Pittsburgh goals, the final three coming in a 1:45 span. Daniel Alfredsson scored a late power-play goal, but now the longtime Ottawa captain could be facing his final NHL game if the Senators can't win and prolong the series.

&gt; ""Your focus has to go into [Game 5],"" Alfredsson said. ""It's a big game. Whatever happens, happens. I don't know myself yet. It's not something about or 'what ifs.' It's about going to Pittsburgh and trying to bring another game back to this building.""

Dupuis scored his second shorthanded goal of the series and is tied with Crosby with a League-leading seven goals.

**Season Series:** This is the fourth and final meeting. The Penguins have taken two of the past three from the Flyers. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Pittsburgh is fresh off of another come-from-behind win, as it earned a 4-2 victory against the New York Islanders at Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum on Friday. The Islanders recorded the first 12 shots of the game, but the Pens stayed the course and grabbed their first lead of the night early in the third period on a goal from Brandon Sutter.

“We’re just finding ways to win right now,” Sutter said. “I think we want to keep playing the way we are. We don’t really want to change much. Obviously, we think we can still get better at certain things. I think if we keep that mindset, hopefully we can keep doing well.”

















**Flyers:**  Well rested, the Flyers are looking for revenge after the Penguins came back from a three-goal deficit to beat them 5-4 on March 7. Philadelphia has not played since Monday’s 4-2 loss to Tampa Bay. Flyers coach Peter Laviolette let it be known that he wasn’t happy about the break.

“Obviously, you would rather be playing games and trying to make a difference in the standings, but there’s nothing we can do about that,” Laviolette said.

In any other season, a five-day break at this point in the season would be welcome. However, the Flyers seem anxious to get back to action and attempt to right their ship.

Also of note, the Flyers have history on their side, ending the Pens’ 11-game streak last March and their 12-game streak back in 2010-11.








__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Flyers forward Max Talbot has three goals in his past five games. … Penguins goaltender Marc-Andre Fleury will most likely get the nod to start Sunday’s game, when he will look to extend his six-game win streak. 

**Injury Report:** The Flyers will be without forwards Tye McGinn (orbital bone) and Jody Shelley (hip). … Pittsburgh could get a boost with the return of stars Evgeni Malkin (upper body) and Kris Letang (lower body). Both participated in Friday’s morning skate on Long Island, but neither played. They will be game-time decisions Sunday.

**TV:** NHLN-US; RDS2; ROOT, MSG PLUS 

**Season Series:** It's the fourth of five meetings this season. Pittsburgh has won the last two, including a 4-2 victory at the Nassau Coliseum in early February. 
__________________________________________________________

**Penguins:**  Pittsburgh is perfect in March, winning all 10 of its games to blow the Atlantic Division race wide open. The Penguins have shown they can outscore teams -- they outscored opponents 26-18 in the first five wins -- and shut them down; the last five opponents have managed just five goals.

The Penguins are the first team in NHL history to have 10-game win streaks in three consecutive seasons.

""The importance is probably greater just because of a shortened season, but I think the good thing for us is that we're playing so many games and I don't think anyone is thinking a whole lot about it, we're just going out there and playing the way that we need to,"" captain Sidney Crosby said.
















**Islanders:**  If NHL games were 40 minutes long, the Islanders would be Stanley Cup contenders. But they're not -- and the Islanders' third-period miseries have damaged their chances of making the playoffs for the first time since 2007.

The Isles blew a 3-1 lead by allowing four third-period goals to Ottawa on Tuesday, then were outscored 3-0 by Montreal in the third period on Thursday in a 5-2 loss.

""We've got to have that killer instinct and understand that we can't lay off the gas pedal a little bit just because we've got the lead or we're playing well,"" said center John Tavares, who scored the Islanders' first goal. ""The first 40 minutes of the last few games have been pretty good for us. We should be confident. We want to play with the lead. It takes a lot out of you to come back.""







__________________________________________________________

**Who's hot:** Crosby is running away with the scoring title and has five points in his past four games. Marc-Andre Fleury has won his last five starts, allowing only eight goals. … Islanders defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky has goals in back-to-back games. Matt Moulson has a six-game assists streak and set up both goals on Thursday. 

**Injury Report:** Pittsburgh star Evgeni Malkin is hoping to return against the Islanders after two days of practice. Defenseman Kris Letang (lower body) didn't practice Thursday and appears less likely to play. … The Islanders are without ex-Penguins defenseman Brian Strait (ankle) and forward David Ullstrom (groin).
