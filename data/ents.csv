I've partook and there was a significant change in the way I felt. I had more energy believe it or not and the pain was significantly lessened. Why is it OK for the people in other states to have safe access and I cannot get it to help me? Why am I being made a criminal for getting a treatment that works when it is allowed in other states for people with the same condition? There is really no way for me to get it either as I am a 30+ female and have no 'connections' to get the stuff that can actually make me feel somewhat normal. I am on 11 prescribed medications, one is an injection that I do not know what the long term side effects will be. How is this fair?

I hurt all the time and I have trouble walking sometimes. I get depressed because I cannot do all of the things that I would like to do, while there are other people getting the treatment that I would like to have rather than taking all of the 'safe' medications that have so far caused bone death resulting in 2 joint replacements. My 'treatments' are slowly killing me. I'm tired all the time and I don't even feel like going to the grocery. I have lost 65 lbs in the past year. One of the prescribed medications has caused a hole in my stomach. WTF can be done to help people like me? I would like to go all natural, change my diet and just vaporize if I feel an attack coming on. This seems like the best way but the insurance companies and drug companies will never allow for this and will throw enough money at the issue to make the politicians vote for their benefit. 

    Just to give you an idea I pay at least 500+ in insurance premiums a month plus my co pays which are 20%. My injection retails for 1200$ per month. I will never pay all of my hospital or transport costs, I just pay what I can when I can.

Their observation of their external reality is easily compartamentalized from the philosphical conundrum some find themselves always asking - 'what the fuck am I doing here, and I am doing it right?', and I suppose for those people, their life might be uncomplicated. However, for those of us whose brains acts as ninjas, continually mind fucking them with the profound and constant quest for truth, life can be extremely fulfilling, but a constant battle against this ""self devouring paradox termination"". Anyways, while l was having one of those nights, in which I was contemplating my life, the people in it, etc., I decided that somehow, if I could just slow down time and my thought process than maybe I could extract some sort of eternal truth that I had not seen before. So my brother and I busted out his bong, and needless to say I was stoned out of my mind before I even had the chance to catch my breath.

As I lay in bed, on my back, watching my fan manifest its centripetal destiny, I found myself completely overwhelmed by the notion that I very much enjoyed being by myself. In that moment, I was just able to appreciate the simplicity of light and it was in the simple enjoyement of being able to discriminate light from dark, I had this ironic realization that my mind had been incepted, and that society had pulled off the greatest inception against us:  we have failed, or should feel sad, if we are alone. There in the light, I found myself content with the realization that my own existance was enough, and enjoyed the company of my own mind. It was then that I said to myself, "" Fuccckkkk I am a stoner"" (the loner stereotype associated with being a stoner) and "" Fuckkkkkk my ex boyfriend was a piece of shit, as well as ' Fuck life is beautiful, it is tragic no one delights in the ingeniuty and miraculous power of the mind to be able to invent such a mechanism to capture the poetic sense of light, and I can seriously do anything with my life'. The greatest irony in my small epiphany, was not that these are obvious conclusions that most arrive at in some point in their life, but rather the irony that I thought my life had already been a manifestation of these realizations, but the next morning, I had felt like I could see clearly for the first time.

I feel incompetent when everyone references all the supposed ent-culture here and I can't seem to find it.

Partly it's that I'm too paranoid to ask a stranger, having lived in the south where you can't take these things lightly, and part of it is that no one in my social circle is an ent and as a busy grad student, I don't branch out very much. 

I'd like to befriend some local ents. I miss the ent sense of humor, making kat williams references and hiking at a [1-6].  I also paint and draw and would enjoy any of these activities with like-minded folks. Let's see where this post takes me. I have faith in reddit (and I don't have faith in much).

So I was thinking, would people actually buy a starter kit of sorts?

Imagine a grinder, papers, matches, hemp wick, mini-pipe, screens, eye-drops, mints, maybe even a pack of cheeze-its and gum or something all inside of an air-tight glass jar which could serve as the stash.

Do you think it would actually be useful, and would anybody be interested in something like that? Especially if it was cheaper than buying everything by itself.

One of the biggest reasons I haven't gone to a doctor though is that I have my medical marijuana card - I'm in Michigan.  I have heard from others that a doctor can refuse to treat you if they find THC in your blood or you admit to having the card.  I am no good at defending myself, and if they tell me to stop or get rid of the card or something like that...I don't know what I will do.

I had the pleasure of working for a local headshop as a temp during 4/20. I'm sad I found out it was only temporary (was told prior I'd be with the company for a 3 month trial run), but nonetheless, I want to thank the pot smoking community.

I worked a long day, 11 hours with a 45 minute lunch. We had our best sales day in the history of the store. We were busy as fuck. We had lines that were 45+ minutes long most of the day, and nearing an hour when NORML showed up. 

But you, my dear ents, were patient. I've worked retail at Christmas. I've worked back to school at an office supply store. Shit sucks. People are demanding and pissy. The only complaint I got at the headshop was ""damn, the line is long. Guess that's what I get for going to a headshop on 4/20"". Our owners were bringing food and drinks for free to people in line. You take care of us by buying shit, we take care of you. Nobody honestly complained and it was a great day to work.

We gave away over $1000 in a charity raffle, and in turn raised quite a bit more than that (not sure if I'm allowed to disclose how much).

And after the long day of work, our whole crew blazed out back. It was great, I made a lot of friends, found out former employees smoke, and had a great time all day.

I was going to post this closer to 4/20, but it's my cake day today so fuck it.

I'm dry now, I didn't work long enough there to secure a hookup, and haven't had one since moving to Indianapolis, but I'm currently unemployed anyways, so I need to stay clean for a job. Regardless, you guys made it a great day to work. Keep being chill, and keep on blazing.

In principle, I don't mind and I've even indulged with her a few times. The problem is that her use has escalated to a point that it's worrying me a lot. She's smoking throughout the day - before work, while driving, on breaks at work, after work - pretty much constantly. She literally goes through several hundred dollars of weed per week - it's where all of her money goes, since she's living at home (no rent, car paid for). I know weed isn't supposed to be physically addictive, but psychologically, anything can be addictive and if she were drinking this much, people would definitely be calling it alcoholism.

She recently lost her wallet and she wasn't worried about her debit card or driver's license - only her weed license. 

How do I approach her about this? I'm not trying to demonize weed, just to discuss with her the amount that she's using - I'm worried about her. She's given up on several of her former hobbies, her relationship with her family has suffered dramatically (when she's not stoned, she can't seem to control her temper anymore; it's bad enough that I've heard them talking about kicking her out), and it's influenced her priorities dramatically - weed had become her life.

I also apologize in advance but will reply to anyone in due time# 

Hello my fellow ents.



I have been smoking, joints (my specifically intended type of administration method) daily for the past 3 weeks.

The type of high that i have managed to attain is a very productive, switched on, stimulated type of high. I have achieved more in thelast 3 weeks then i have ever had in any other three week period. The pace of my life has accelerated to the point that i feel almost as if im livibg several lives in one. I have a full time job in the health profession, i am a full time student studying arts, im still maintaining a great daily social lifestyle, not to mention going to parties on the weekend and relaxation time watching tv and youtube . Im running atleast 2-4 hours a week and i still find the time to go rockclimbing about twice a week.

Now dont get me wrong here, its not all trees that has helped me to get here but its definately had a strong impact and continues to help me steer my life in the right direction (along with other psychoactive tools)

I have been crafting my state of mind for many years, ever since my concious awakening, my continual expansion of sentience, perspective and conciousness (which also entails periods of compleate lack of thought/internal dialogue.. But i digress). 

I have previously tried something simillar In which i consumed trees every day for three month which ended in a 'stoned out' as opposed to a 'stoned in' experience. I believe that this was because i was consuming wayyy too much (oz a week) and in the incorrect way for me (bongs(i dont appose bongs, i just feel they are too strong for my psuche to handle leading to a somewhat sensory overload). 

But the biggest contributing factor to my state of mind has been my phylisophical and spiritual quest to attain a higher conciousness. This higher conciousness has been made greatly through sciebtific understanding in conjunction with my openess to understand ''mystical'' and shemanic experiences, teachers and people. There are many false prophets and thoughts that i have come across and sifted through using all the knowledge i have gained through scientific and observational means that grow on a phylosophical membrane B)

So i hope to serve as an example for you fellow ends driven with self doubt about the, if i should or shouldnt smoke, is it right or wrong connundrum.

But let me heed to you these last thoughts...

-anything in exess is poison (universal law)
-relax your shoulders, take a few sweet breaths and take a few minutes out of your day to think about... Absolutely nothing. Alow yourself to get lost in the moment wherever u may be.
-and you will always remember that your traveling in the right direction no matter how many detours it takes you to find the right one. The one that makes you feel right at home in your own two shoes, the one you always wished and strived to be in.

Peace my fellow ents and i hope this has helped you on your journey

I didn't know where to post this so i'm gonna try here, if this is in bad taste please let me know. This is a throw away account. 

I'm going through a rough time right now. The other day I got a call and was told my grandfather would be passing very soon. So I hopped a plan that day to come down to California (I'm in WA). Now I am here in morro bay, Ca and I am alone with my mom until Tuesday, when we finally go and see him. Tomorrow is the 4th and I will be out and about in Avila Beach and I was wondering if maybe I can meet a few ents and talk story. I would love to know more about the surrounding areas. A little about me, I am a 27 y/o male who is retired from the armed service after being wounded in combat twice. I have my MMJ card in WA but crossing state lines I couldn't bring my medication with me (and I prefer not to take the percocet and morphine the VA shovels down my throat). You guys have really made me laugh to the point of tears for the nearly 6 months I have been here. Your amazing attitude and chill state is what actually made me try it to begin with (about two months ago). I can honestly say that my card has improved my life, and it is in large part due to r/trees.So, anyone willing to show an out of stater some California Love?

Is it too much to ask...that people be given the right to do with their bodies as they choose when it harms no others? If people could legally grow their own plant in the privacy of their homes then your entire argument falls flat on its face. Please educate yourself, and try not to take the approach that the laws on the books are always in your best interest or fair or even intended for the common good. 

Marijuana laws are historically an end to an unjustified means. Whether it be to oppress black jazz musicians in the 20s and 30s, or to enable the easy imprisonment of peaceful protesters in the 60s and 70s.  More often than not it is to ensure the profits of special interest groups like the cotton industry in the early 20th century, or the privatized prison industry and big Pharma of the 21st. 

Ask yourself this:

Is it too much to ask that our government listen to the over 50% of the people, and stop oppressing those that are looking for a cheap medicine, or healthier alternative to alcohol?

http://www.gallup.com/poll/150149/record-high-americans-favor-legalizing-marijuana.aspx

People's lives are ruined every day right here in America because of marijuana prohibition. A simple possession charge can begin a cycle of institutionalization that many never fully recover from.  Millions of patients cannot have access to cheap, safe, and effective medications because these laws that, you want everyone to blindly follow, say there is zero medicinal value...even in the face of an avalanche of real world subjective AND empirical data to the contrary. 

The worse part of your argument is that using marijuana does NOT cause violence across the border. The failed prohibition and resulting black market are to blame. Take away the prohibition and you take away the financial incentive for modern day bootleggers.  The drug war is the single most destructive policy our government has ever shackled us to, and it is that policy that is at fault, not the poor individuals that would rather smoke a joint than get addicted to OxyContin or drink alcohol because that avenue of intoxication alone is acceptable for some reason.  Alcohol kills approximately 75000 Americans a year. Marijuana kills 0.  Yet you think it's not too much to ask everyone to ignore all of these facts and blindly obey.... 

With all due respect, open your eyes.

I want to start anew. This reddit (r/trees) has opened my eyes again to the world of enjoyment, pleasure, and blissfulness opened by trees. I use the drugs Lexapro and Lamictal to stabilize my mood after a head injury back in 1986. Trees can render both drugs moot (hence the resistence from pharma, another rant) but Florida doesn't have medical MJ yet.

Without being specific, I'm on the east coast of Florida close to Cape Cannabinol. I no longer work in government with fear of random testing.

We have a smoke shop or two (those tobacco and specialty cigar stores) in our city. I'd assume I could visit those and drop hints; but that is just what an undercover cop would do. I also have a family and being arrested is not a good thing, especially with the draconian Florida laws.

In Cognito we'll have nothing to hide.
Let's go incognito, honey,
And let the world believe we've died

Meet me in Cognito, baby,
Of course we'll have to color our hair.
The best thing about life in Cognito
Is that everybody's nobody there

Meet me in Cognito, darling,
Sure, some may think it's rash,
But you'll look chic incognito
With your fake nose and Groucho moustache.

Meet me in Cognito, baby,
We'll soon leave our pasts behind us.
The present is always a mystery,
As the future never fails to remind us.

Once we're alone in Cognito,
We'll remove all of our clothes very fast,
But though we'll be naked as jaybirds,
At no time will we take off our masks.

Cinderella went incognito,
And it's said she had a ball.
It's always midnight in Cognito
By the black clock at the end of the hall.

We're destined to be clandestine,
Incognito is our very last hope.
I'll meet you where the sun don't shine
With a fake ID and some dope.

So, do join me in Cognito,
You know that i'll never tell.
We'll sneak through the back door of Heaven
And stroll unnoticed through Hell.

Incognito
Incognito
There, every day's a surprise
Incognito
Incognito
Where truth tells all the best lies.

I would very much like to be able to toke up with my friends, however, I have had some bad experiences that have pretty much scared me away from smoking. First time I tried, it was alright, nothing special, felt a bit of change but I heard people usually don't their first time. Second time was great, had a lot of fun and felt really good. The third time however, after smoking a bowl we went and sat outside, and everything went wrong. I felt as if the time between my breaths were centuries apart and I was going to suffocate right then and there. I also felt my heart beating incredibly fast, and overall I was just scared shitless of my health and I felt helpless. I was able to calmly tell my friends I wasn't feeling too great, they brought me inside, and I felt the exact same. The only thing that helped it was for me to move around, and so I just had to be swaying back and forth while my friends were all completely blazed trying not to make me more paranoid. Finally I guess the effects started to wear off and I was able to relax and sit down. I didn't lose my faith there, and a few weeks later I decided that that experience was probably just a fluke and that I would give smoking another chance, but sadly I endured the same result. It almost feels as though I have panic attacks from smoking. I've heard of people being allergic to weed before, so is that my problem? Or is there something else that I'm doing wrong? Ents, please guide me with your wisdom.

I have at least a year to prep, so I wanna learn about Ottawa as much as possible. I can deal with cold weather, eventually, I can buy layers anywhere. But what I CAN'T deal with is an area that is going to hassle me about smoking dope more conservatively than other places - at that point I might as well just stay in California, you know?

So, Ottawans, can you give it to me straight? What is life like for an Ent in Ottawa, especially if I am coming from a place where trees have been slightly decriminalized?

Thanks so much for your input!

Some people use it for meetups, which is not against the rules. 

In some ways, this makes things easy, and most posts aren't a problem. On the other hand, when a post gets reported and/or messaged to us, we sometimes have to deliberate on whether it should be taken down, and we've never had a problem (as far as I know) with our one rule being broken. 

Now, yes, we could just throw up a bunch of rules and tell you to follow them, but even though we're not purely democratic, we'd like to see ourselves as enlightened dictators here (well, maybe not, but you get the idea). We've decided that the community should recommend rules to be posted in the sidebar, and the most popular suggestions (within reason, of course) will make the cut! Plus, y'all can't complain about the rules if y'all created the rules!

We are always working to serve the community, so really, this is a great time to share your thoughts! The current rule will remain in effect, however.

Thanks, y'all, for making /r/ents such a great place, and we look forward to seeing your suggestions!

Does it matter which one I use? Of course, this is for dilution, and I'll be getting some vitamin B2 as well.

Update:  Couldn't even find B2 or creatine at Walgreens (online ordering only I guess). Bought regular creatine at Rite Aid for $15 -- I suspect (hope) the ""ph correct"" label is just marketing aimed at those trying to pass a drug test.

One thing I don't get is why vitamin B complex is suggested as an substitute for B2 -- none of the complexes I found contain B2, rather just B6 and B12. They all add yellow?

So, I'm a somewhat experienced user, not super experienced but not a complete noob, I've smoked more times than you can count on both hands. I've gotten pretty high before, experienced bodily effects before, but nothing like last night.            

I went over to my friends house for 4-20 at 10PM. We had some pot brownies, I was told it was 5 grams of pot in there and it was split into 16 pieces, I had two at once and one maybe an hour later. I also smoked a puff of a joint, and that was everything I had for the night. I didn't know where the pot had came from but we share it all the time so I thought nothing of that.             

The weirdness started with a tingling on my tongue, nothing abnormal at this point, it happens. But then I started becoming extremely aware of what my tongue and lips were doing, my tongue kept folding back into my mouth and I wasn't sure if it was doing that more than normal or I was just hyper-aware of it. A strong tingling also started in my groin region.                     

The next thing was real-time gaps in memory. I would say or do something, then think, ""wait, did I really just do that?"". Like I would touch the table or pull up my pants, then a second later not be sure if I had actually moved at all. I would tell a story to someone and then I would be sitting there, and I wouldn't be sure if I had ever told the story or if I had just been sitting there thinking about the story, and memory of what the story was would quickly fade away into just an impression of what it was. I started asking one person right after each story to quickly say what the last thing I told them was about. Not helpful as I got two word answers like ""uh, take chances?"" and I wasn't sure if I had told a full story about taking chances or if I had just muttered take chances, or if what I said to them (if I had said anything at all, as even that much detail faded quickly) was on that topic at all.                      

By this point my vision kept blanking out and my entire body felt so tingly that I couldn't feel it touching anything, but I kept operating in a functional way, walking on my own and operating my phone etc, so it wasn't like I had lost that functionality, more like it was in my head I guess.                                     

I went to the washroom and somehow used it perfectly and everything, which seemed like I shouldn't be able to do because of such strong tingling, vision and memory lapses. Went to bed after that at 3:30 and all that continued, I would move my hand from the pillow to the blankets and not be sure I had moved it until I double checked, or could only make my hands feel something if I rubbed it between my fingers for a long time and focused my mind on my hands.                    

I woke up at 10 today and some of those effects were still continuing, the tingling was still in my hands mostly, but by now it was easier to make it going away just by focusing on my hands. My memory was still weird but there weren't any more big rapidly fading gaps, just small spots where it would get a bit fuzzy, but again if I focused I could function well. Got home no problem.           

It's 12PM now, the after effects are *still* coming, but weakly,in waves. Every once in a while I become aware of what my tongue is doing but at the same time it feels a bit numb.                             


So that's about it, sorry that was really long but I wanted to put down all the things I thought were weird, does all this sound like I just had too much or was something else going on?

I've been living in Charlotte, NC for seven or eight months now. I expected to have friends and contacts in the area by now, but... nope! I'm wondering what fellow Ents do in this city, and what kind of culture I should look for.


Moved here for an 9-5 job and am in my very-early 20s. Unsure how to make friends in the area without a college social network. I know a lot of kids my age are having this problem as they graduate and chase pay stubs in new cities. My job isn't the appropriate place to seek out ents - it's a mystical ""career"" thing people whisper about in the shadows.


I live with my boyfriend, also in his early 20s. We're pretty standard nerds: last weekend we watched MLG tournaments (Barcraft in Charlotte, do you exist?) while playing the GW2 Beta. Neither of us are particularly outgoing and are very much home bodies.


Where should I look for young-ish people with interests similar to ours? We have a lot of trouble communing with other young-professional types, who seem to enjoy hitting the bars over quiet nights. We'd much prefer to rip a bong and play Dota or read manga.


We also love tabletop! I own a pretty nice selection of board games that are currently gathering dust without friends to play with. Looking for a poker circle too.


I'm not necessarily looking to meet people from Internetland, but I think this is a good place to gather suggestions and heads-up from the Charlotte Ent community.

In cities I've lived in previously, there were always LAN cafes where I could meet fellow smoker-gamers or meetups on my campus. Not sure where to go here. :(",,False,self,t5_2reeu,False,,,True,t3_x6ufz,http://www.reddit.com/r/ents/comments/x6ufz/fellow_ents_gamers_charlotte_nc_704/,

Bring munchies and a dub sack, I'll have papers and a sneak a toke and a few grams. Feel free to bring your own peice.

I didn't choose the location, it's just the location of the current reddit meetup. If it's too far I suggest you come meet me at vapor lounge around 7/8 pm. I'll have my pineapple with me. I'll be around all day today to answer questions :D

I'm 20 years old, male, and have been living on my own for about a year working three jobs. A couple months ago my parents had nowhere to stay. My Dad has been out of work for awhile and my mom can't work so I invited them to live with me at my one bedroom apartment. They agreed on the terms that they would try to get back on their feet again ASAP. Good news is my Dad finally found employment and a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders...
So why am I here fellow ENTS? Well my schedule and obligations have seriously hindered my ability to maintain any friends locally. I get kinda lonely. One of my favorite parts about being an ENT is having fellow ENTS around to shoot the breeze with. I decided to post on here looking for a friENT in my area.
So here's some quick info about me - I smoke! - I play video games competitively - I dance - I workout avidly and love fitness - I love movies - I love people
So if you live in the Dallas area and want to make a friend I'm right behind ya.

By voting “1” for Christopher Steele, the Liberal Democratic Party’s (LDP’s) candidate, voters can be assured of choosing a representative who will do everything possible, to abolish “the Nanny State”.

Christopher is standing for a South Australia in which, for instance, adults have the right to enjoy marijuana, quite legally. A South Australia where, decisions on such matters as euthanasia, abortion, gay marriage as well as the right to freely enjoy recreational fishing and other personal choices are no longer interfered with by government.

“South Australians are sick of being browbeaten, by government’s patronising ‘we-know-what’s-best-for-you’ position”, says Chris, who also explains: “I’m pretty confident that only you know what is best for you, in a way that government can never truly appreciate. That’s why, the less government bosses you about, the better off you are.”

Chris also stands for the abolition and reduction of most taxes in South Australia and a corresponding reduction in government spending. Chris says: “By shedding the vast burden of our current state tax regime, all South Australians will be economically liberated. Business will skyrocket and ordinary South Australians will prosper as a result.”

The Liberal Democratic Party plans to roll back enormous swathes of legislation, especially laws that create “victimless crimes” or that unnecessarily restrict people's livelihoods or recreational activities... and to roll back taxes and charges, including Payroll Tax and Stamp Duty. As South Australia’s true libertarian party, the LDP believes that government has a much smaller role to play than the over-inflated, self-serving leviathan it has become – and must be reined in, for the benefit of all South Australians.

What's more, the LDP also believes that government should serve, not rule and accordingly supports the introduction of direct democracy, giving all South Australians a say over how they are governed.

So if you like the idea of a lot less tax and much lower charges for services in SA, as well as a lot more freedom in your personal life, please vote for Christopher Steele of the LDP on February 11th.",,False,self,t5_2reeu,False,,,True,t3_phrb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ents/comments/phrb1/any_ents_from_south_australia_in_the_ramsay/,
