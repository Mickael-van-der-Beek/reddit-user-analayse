1331319331.0,473,self.hardware,qp7vc,Don't buy Lexmark printers.,Benbulthuis,553,80,260,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/qp7vc/dont_buy_lexmark_printers/,"So here is why you should never buy a Lexmark printer.

I purchased a Prevail 705 for my home office about a year and a half ago. I rarely print, but for some reason my black ink cartridge decided to go bad with about 35% capacity remaining. So I needed to replace the cartridge.

Lexmark offers two black cartridges: a 100XL, and a 105XL. They are physically identical. There are literally zero differences between the two. The difference is in price: a 100XL is $28, a 105XL is $4.99. 

Now, my printer is one of the models ""not supported"" by the 105XL. If you try to use a 105XL cartridge in it, the printer will tell you that it is wrong. How do they do this? With an RFID chip that's under the label. So, I swapped the RFID chip from the old cartridge to the new cartridge and voila, it is recognized as fully compatibile and prints like new.

But wait: The print cartridge still shows as 35% full, despite being brand new. Why is that? Because Lexmark doesn't actually check the ink levels, the ink cartridge counts how many pages you print, and after X number of pages you have to change the cartridge. By re-using the old RFID chip, my printer thinks my brand new cartridge is at 35% capacity.

(AMENDED THIS PER RESULTS OF MY TESTING) Here is where the total bullshit starts: If you continue to print, once you ""run out"" of ink, some users have reported that the printer will start fake printing bad black text. Yes, despite the fact that the cartridge is mostly full, it will still print black text with lines through it and other artifacts that indicate you are out of ink. That would mean Lexmark intentionally programmed them to do this.

Why are they doing all of this? To scam you into paying for either A) A $200-300 printer to use cheap ink, or B) to make a shitload of money by selling you artificially expensive black ink cartridges.

Fuck Lexmark. 

Edit 1: Additional information from the Amazon user reviews. Just want to post this so other people see I am not making it up: http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5MYFLWH7BLR/ref=cm_cr_dp_cmt?ie=UTF8&amp;ASIN=B002E9N5PW&amp;nodeID=172282&amp;tag=&amp;linkCode=#wasThisHelpful

Edit 2: Pictures of said cartridges:

http://imgur.com/MKvwm - 100XL on the left, 105XL on the right. 105XL is higher because the safety cap is still on, they are physically the same.

http://imgur.com/BNgrp - another comparison, can you tell them apart?

http://imgur.com/NbjsZ - this is where the RFID tag is located, under the label.

Edit 3: I was asked to confirm that the printer will print bad black text. I originally read that problem here: 

http://www.amazon.com/review/R3E5MYFLWH7BLR/ref=cm_cr_rev_detmd_pl?ie=UTF8&amp;cdForum=Fx3B6UPRO9WAFCL&amp;cdMsgNo=19&amp;cdPage=2&amp;asin=B002E9N5PW&amp;store=electronics&amp;cdSort=oldest&amp;cdThread=Tx7UMPK9HPPJF3&amp;cdMsgID=Mx134MUWOFFQBNM#Mx134MUWOFFQBNM

However, I had not personally experienced that as I had just swapped the cartridge. So, I decided to test this myself. I made a Word doc of nothing but full page text, set the printer to ""automatic"" quality, and printed it until I ""ran out of ink"". The cartridge is advertised as offering 1 cent B&amp;W prints, so at $5 it should offer around 500 prints on a new cartridge. Mine failed at around ~150 pages of black and white text. It did NOT start printing erratically or print bad text in my case - it printed one final page, and refused to print anymore. This actually lends credence to the idea that the printers have a pre-determined # of prints per cartridge, set in the RFID chip, as the old RFID chip from my last cartridge had been reporting 25-35% capacity. However I cannot confirm the above users post. In either case, this is still most definitely a scam.",,False,,t5_2qh18,True,,,True,t3_qp7vc,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/qp7vc/dont_buy_lexmark_printers/,

I bought a motherboard, refurbished (I do not know what went through my mind).  I didn't work and so I returned it.  They did not accept it in its condition and claimed that I have tampered with the cpu pins and made a fuss about installation and having not wiped thermal paste off. I have worked on several computer builds to know how to handle motherboard cpu pins.  This was what I received when I got my motherboard back.  http://i.imgur.com/m4Evj61.png

I've disputed the charge and now I am dealing with this. http://i.imgur.com/i5XDLro.png

If ever you return something, I would suggest that you take pictures of the item(s) before you return them.  

I have never been screwed in such a way before.  For me, Newegg is dead to me.  I understand this is only within the department, but I still feel as if Newegg in general is to blame.  Trust is something this company has issues with.  There are other forums on this issue as well.

When I got a wild hair and started scouring the net for the problem again I finally found the answer on a tiny blog out in the middle of the internet. The answer is so dumb that I can't believe Samsung hasn't fired someone over it. How the TV knows how to display a signal is determined by *what you name the channel.*

When it's named the base ""HDMI 1/2/3/4"" it uses some arcane basic settings, but when you name it ""PC"" it sets it up to utilize previously greyed out menu settings....

To make accessing the content as simple as possible, I have setup a twitter account that relays published products. E.g. a tweet would be ""Macbook Air. 12 Critic Reviews. 86%"". If this is useful, then please go ahead and follow: [http://twitter.com/smuggdotcom ](http://twitter.com/smuggdotcom  )

1298071242.0,213,self.hardware,fo78s,WARNING: WD external hard drives now require special drivers... WD official solution is to buy older ones,derphurr,266,53,83,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/fo78s/warning_wd_external_hard_drives_now_require/,"If you make the mistake of buying a WD Passport or My Book, you cannot plug the thing into any computer without it prompting to install drivers (SES - SCSI Enclosure Services custom WD driver).  I later found out that is required because of onboard chipset that allows you to lock the device.  It is not mentioned or advertised except for one line on the box saying ""Password Protection"".


Here is the solution and steps required every time you plug your USB harddrive to a new computer. http://wdc.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3739/~/what-is-the-ses-driver,-why-is-it-needed,-and-how-to-get-the-driver-popup-to


The tier 2 tech support basically agreed the behavior of this drive is identical to a USB thumbdrive infected with a virus/trojan that tries to force a driver install every time you infect a new computer.


WD recommendation was to return it and get the Essentials line which still functions like a normal USB harddrive.  If you buy a WD external, you can no longer just plug it into someones computer and copy files.  They had no response to how this is not defective... considering for the last decade USB harddrives work in a certain manner when plugged in.




Update:

Just to be clear, the hardware identifies two USB devices when plugged in:

One is standard UMS devices, which is supported on every operating system.  
The other is SES driver which may be present in some linux, but not in windows or mac.  The software to lock or unlock the drive only is supported in windows and mac.  

You can use this drive in every way like a normal USB harddrive if you do one of two things:

(1) Install the SES driver on any computer you plug it into.

(2) Click cancel on the new device found - install driver - search for driver EVERY TIME you plug it in.",,False,,t5_2qh18,True,,,True,t3_fo78s,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/fo78s/warning_wd_external_hard_drives_now_require/,

Here are the [pictures.](http://imgur.com/a/7evOz#0)

The actuator arm uses a spring loaded lock that unlocks when the spindle starts to spin. There is a little magnet that unlocks because of the Hall effect. It was a very simple solution to a relatively complicated problem: How do you keep the actuator from moving when the hard drive is off?

This was nothing super special and this may not be the right subreddit, but I tried :)

The one they shipped to me had bent CPU socket pins. Sent it back for an RMA. They denied it because it had bent CPU socket pins. 

Well.  Yeah, that's why I sent it back.  I've been going round and round with them via email and phone all week. They say that bent pins can be caused by improper installation and therefore they automatically reject RMAs involving bent pins. True, but they can also be caused by improper installation of the socket protector, or something falling on the board on the assembly line, or a number of other reasons that are not my fault. 

Newegg says they don't care, if they send me something that's damaged, it's my problem. In my last phonecall, I pointed out that the Warranty of Merchantability says they have to refund/replace defective products if they don't work. The supervisor told me that their company policy supersedes US law. 

Guess I'll have to start doing builds with other vendors, which is a real shame. They used to be great - I've been building computers with parts from them since they opened, but if I have to risk losing all my money if they send me broken parts, I can't afford to shop there anymore.


This is not the Newegg that I used to shop at. Buyer beware.

((Edit)) Here's the screenshots of the email conversation:

http://imgur.com/a/d3VrQ

They didn't respond to the last email, at which point I called them.

((Edit 2))

FireStarterBob's suggestion to post the problem up on resellerratings.com worked. They've now refunded the money, and offered her a $25 credit toward future purchases.

Unfortunately for them, I'm still not going to buy from them until I get assurances that their returns policy is not ""reject returns until the customer kicks up enough of a fuss so we can profit off the meek,"" but at least we won't have to go through with the chargeback now.

These are coming out with 280+ppi screens, IPS screens, 8MP cameras, gyroscopes, GPS, 3G, etc.

But you can't do any real work on them - you can't install Openoffice for word processing, you can't do programming, proper photo editing etc.

If you want to get any real work done you need to go to a laptop, where we're stuck with technology that is badly lagging behind: laptops with 1366x768px 140ppi screens, little noisy fans, spinning hard drives as standard, no 3G/wimax unless you ""upgrade"", no GPS, no capacitative touch screen, no IPS panels (horrible last-century TN screens instead), no AMOLED, heavier and thicker.  Stepping from the iPad/Galaxy Tab section over to the laptop section in an electronics store feels like going back in time.

The ASUS Transformer series seems to be one of a few that are trying to bridge the gap, but it still leans too far towards a ""play"" device than a ""work"" device mainly because due to software (Android, which is not built for getting work done - where's Openoffice for it?).

Intel-style ""Ultrabooks"" are also trying to bridge the gap from the other end, but they are still throwing old-fashioned TN panels on them like it's 1999.

I'm happy to balance something with a proper keyboard on my lap when I'm travelling.  Whether that end up being called a ""laptop"" or a ""convertible tablet"" or something.

At the very least, I'd like to see either

- IPS panels, 200+ppi screens, AMOLED, etc starting to appear on laptops (regardless of OS limitations)
- Openoffice, GIMP, Microsoft Office, etc appearing on ""ASUS Transformer""-like devices, and these devices becoming the new convergence devices",,False,,t5_2qh18,True,,,True,t3_rglqj,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/rglqj/something_thats_beginning_to_depress_me_a_bit/,

Stop giving out advice on a whim without following the logical troubleshooting process. If your car starts wobbling down the freeway because you have a punctured tire, do you go out and get your wheels re-balanced? No, you check for the most common faults first, like a flat tire.

~~Keyboard cannot be replaced without replacing the entire trackpad top cover assembly. That is just evil.

~~Screen panel cannot be replaced without dismantling half the machine (due to retarded design of hinge cover).

~~Screen bezel is attached by little grey plastic clips which warp and pull out making bezel replacement fiddly.

~~Battery cannot be easily attached without L bracket because of stupid eject levers for ram.

~~Almost every screw is different, and assembly-disassembly down to logic board level is fiddly and torturous.

~~Error messages are just meaningless pictograms.

~~Many startup options require a 4 FINGER keypress combination to activate.

I purchased a wind force GTX 670, after 35 days it died. The re-seller told me to take a hike in terms of RMA or an exchange so I was forced to deal with Gigabyte directly.

They basically try their hardest to avoid repairing your product, it took me 3 days to convince them the card was defective.. It would give off smoke when plugged in... Pretty sure sign!

So I finally get an RMA number, ship the thing for $30 CAN, only to be hit with a $35 brokerage charge at the border! Gigabyte refused to pay it and said if there is another charge on the way back I will be picking up the tab for that as well.

They have now had the card for a few weeks, I called to get an update and they told me that my RMA number had expired.. 

What the hell Gigabyte!?

TL;DR  Don'y buy a gigabyte, they suck massive balls.

Thanks to all who've supported us!**

Hey Reddit, I'm the designer and one-half of the team behind the NCASE M1 project - an attempt to design and produce a compact performance-oriented Mini-ITX case with the help of the community. We're currently into the third day of our crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo and well on track to hitting our (admittedly modest) goal, with over 2/3rds funded already.

This initial fundraising campaign is *only* to get the prototypes manufactured and tested.  If everything goes according to plan, we will then be moving on to a second campaign (likely on Kickstarter) for a **full, limited production run** of 300-500 units.

If you have any questions, I'll be happy to answer as best as I can.

Our current Indiegogo campaign is [here](http://igg.me/at/ncase-m1-prototype/x/2412477), if you'd like to support our effort.

Articles on our project have been published by [MaximumPC](http://www.maximumpc.com/article/news/ncase_m1_ambitious_attempt_mold_mini_itx_case_enthusiasts2013), as well as [Techspot](http://www.techspot.com/news/51650-crowdfunded-ncase-m1-mini-itx-enthusiast-chassis-inches-toward-reality.html).

After upgrading these machines to Lion, we notice that TimeMachine and simple AFS network access no longer works on the LinkStation.  Windows machines can access it fine, but for the Macs, the LinkStation is a brick.

I go to BuffaloTech.com and look in their forums to see what's happening.  There are something like 100 posts about Buffalo not supporting this hardware with Lion, but the posts are spread around 15-20 threads.  So I make a new thread, asking specifically about this problem.  Only to find myself [banned](http://imgur.com/zuLi1) the next day.  Ok, so don't ask questions.

I call the tech support line, and they tell me that they will **never** update this piece of &lt;1 year old hardware to work with Lion.  I ask for an escalation to their supervisor, and they claim they'll call me back within 24-48 hours.  3 days go by, no phone call.

Short of a class action lawsuit, I don't see how a consumer can ever win in this situation.  Since it's over 6 months old, I can't send it back.  And since it's not an issue they ""support"" they won't help me either.

So, **TL;DR** I bought a ~$1000 piece of hardware from BuffaloTech less than 8 months ago, and they stopped supporting it for modern Operating Systems.  Then I asked them about it in their forums and they banned me the next day.  Their tech support line told me to get bent and then never called back for an escalation.",,False,,t5_2qh18,False,,,True,t3_vixm9,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/vixm9/never_buy_hardware_from_buffalotech_ever/,

It basically allows you to order a mousepad off your very own design, for the silly little price of 0,99$ (And that includes the shipping!)
For anyone interested:

- Create an account on www.artscow.com (Remeber to disable the news emails, unless you actually want them. I havn't recieved any spam from them yet)

- Go to this webpage: http://www.artscow.com/photo-gifts/mousepad/large-mousepad-160 and customize your mousepad. Hint: Don't use a picture that is too dark. It might get a little wierd as the mousepads are a bit dark in colour.

- Put it in your cart and go to checkout.
Fear not when you see the price being around the 10$ + postage!

- Insert the coupon saying ""MOUSEPADFREE"" and see the price magically vanish  into nothing!

- Order

And some extras: I think it's only possible to order 1 mousepad per adress/account/IP (Well it won't let me order anymore, that is)
And it takes around 6-20 days before you recieve it. Depending where you live (Took 7 days here in Europe. I'm pretty sure they ship from Hong Kong)

But, times are a bit slow,and in the down time I though that the community making a Reddit PC would be awesome. Maybe get more subscribers to this sub-reddit or someother ambiguous goal? 

So, I was thinking a small form factor, I have access to LOTS of Mini-ITX and 3.5""/ECX motherboards/single board computers in addition to peripherals, add-ons, hardware and what not. Just puke up words of ideas at me, I'm used to hearing inane rabble on computer specs.


Background: I own a small business that does computer design and manufacturing. We've done work on everything from NetTop's, Panel PCs, Kiosks, Digital Signage you name it - we don't offer much of a standard product line - most designs are proprietary to the company that contracts them. But essentially our background is Sheet Metal, PCB and Finishing - everything you'd need for a computer case. 

I can include wood, plastics, metals and probably whatever else you can come up with in the chassis. (So long as you would normally build something with it, no Jello &amp; Cat Food PC cases)

Here's the boards I have: (Yes this is my website, I made it, if it has any issues let me know.)

3.5""/ECX Motherboards: [Here](http://www.sliger.com/products/motherboards/ecx/)

Mini-ITX: [Here](http://www.sliger.com/products/motherboards/itx/)

Sure there are unique features to a tablet, but are those feature really worth either:
1. A locked-in data plan with some wireless provider?
2. Hundreds of extra dollars for a stand-alone system?

We don't do this with laptops - you can buy a laptop for $200-$300 stand alone in any electronics store - there is no huge move to subsidize them with a two-year contract for all-the-time wireless data access.  

Maybe it's the economics of it all. Maybe tablets will be dirt cheap in 5 years from any store, with an option to add 3G/4G data plans from a variety of providers later.

I had never heard of it before and thought, though it sounded logical, that it was one of the most retarded things I had heard. Well, sure shows me!


For those of you who are unawares, if you have a faulty video card, it can sometimes be fixed by baking it in the oven at 375 for 8-10 minutes. This is because over time the solder which the circuit board floated on to connect everything can break down and crack, often too small to see with your naked eye. Re-heating it can liquefy the solder just enough to fill any crack in the solder, providing adequate connectivity again.

_***EVENT IS ON MARCH 7, NOT 27. TYPOS ARE EVIL. :(***_

1. [Event signup](http://global.amd.com/LP=543)

2. [My verification](https://twitter.com/Thracks/statuses/307732374433697792)

**Q. Uh, okay... But what is this event?**

A. The night before [SXSWi](http://sxsw.com/interactive) kicks off, we're throwing a party called ""AMD Technograffiti."" There are many cool things hardware/PC/technology junkies like myself would be interested in at this event.

1.	It will be hosted by Chris Pirillo. RIP TechTV. /tear

2.	We’ll be showing off some really impressive PC mods built by legendary modders like Ben Heckendorn (aka ""Benheck""), as well as AMD modders like Robert Graham and Ed Callway.  I don't want to spoil the surprise, but these aren't your normal case mods.

3.	We’ll be showing AMD FirePro driving a 3D printer, printing out a PC case. Think about it.

4.	We've invested in a company called CiiNow to leverage our AMD FirePro products to render cloud gaming on the backend. You'll get a crack at the first-ever public demonstration of that technology. Maybe cloud gaming isn't your bag, but the ability to play a game that might require a $500 GPU on a PC that costs just $500 altogether is cool in my book.

5. Prizes! We're giving away scores of coupons for the Never Settle: Reloaded bundle (cards for Crysis 3 + BioShock Infinite ***-OR-*** BioShock Infinite + Tomb Raider). We also have a beastly, Crysis 3-themed rig with a beautiful vinyl wrap designed by Smooth Creations... Yeah, we're giving that away, too. Lots more stuff.

5.	There will be a blogger's lounge (if you're into that sort of thing), a cinema room, a rooftop patio, and some other surprises we’re cooking up.  Thanks to our PR agency (Edelman Digital), the whole event is at an awesome loft at 6th and Congress in downtown Austin.

6. And lots of game demos! If you haven't had a chance to try Eyefinity, or games like Crysis 3 and Tomb Raider, come on down and give them a whirl on our test rigs.

So, from one long-time Redditor to another (4 years and counting on another account), I'd love it if you paid us a visit. :)

//EDIT: Or maybe you just want to stand in a corner and discuss smartphones or something. My Nexus 4's body is ready.

//EDIT 2:

Q. **What is the AMD Advocate program on the signup?**

A. Members of the program will occasionally get the chance to take home an AMD product in exchange for giving the product some airtime on their blog, Twitter, or whatever. Essentially, we want to make reviewers out of ordinary people who will get a chance to spend some time with a CPU or a graphics card and the like. Honestly and openly share your thoughts, start a conversation, get people talking. That's all we ask. :)",,False,,t5_2qh18,1362250918.0,,,True,t3_19if5p,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/19if5p/hi_reddit_my_name_is_robert_and_im_a_marketing/,

How does a company average 9 awards a day? Who is handing out these awards, and why do they bother? What's the point of awards if they are handed out in such numbers? Are they just giving themselves awards every day, like the ASUS award for being ASUS? Or are they counting positive reviews of their products as awards?

This is besides the fact that the software is an IE only silverlight program, you must download it from their website each time you use it. I know the software is silverlight because a right-click anywhere in the interface brings up the silverlight about, plus there are dedicated butons in the interface to tell you the same thing.

I have a logitech wireless mouse, its has 2 way communication above the HID mouse standards so it can tell the computer its running out of batteries, and it has buttons on it that will light up when you get an email or an IM, and then launch the program when you hit the button. But the Logitech software division hits, the drivers vary from 30 to 80 megs between releases, the early versions the IM/email lights where limited to MSN messenger and email, and later, support was completly lost, along with battery status, but the driver keeps getting bigger!

Better yet, at 1pm ET / 10am PT I am hosting a PC Perspective Live Review with NVIDIA's Tom Petersen over at http://pcper.com/live to discuss the new GeForce GTX 660 Ti in terms of performance, features, etc.

PC Perspective has done other events like this including for the GTX 680, GTX 690 and Radeon HD 7970.

Since I know many of you were interested in the GeForce GTX 660 Ti already, I thought I would solicit some questions from the buildapc sub-reddit for either Tom Petersen or myself or both.

What do you want to know about NVIDIA's new graphics card, or maybe NVIDIA in general? Vote up some your best questions as we'll answer them on the live stream!

Also, any feedback you have for me on these types of events would be appreciated! Thanks!

(Disclosure: posted this at /r/buildapc first but they seemed to say it should go here!)

**EDIT** Oh...and we ARE going to be giving away at GeForce GTX 660 Ti on the live stream, so you'll want to make sure you are in attendance!!!

1363834991.0,96,self.hardware,1apkag,"Protip: if you run into a BIOS with really cryptic fan control settings (e.g. ""Smart Fan Slope"" or ""PWM Duty Cycle Off""), use a tool like SpeedFan to get the name of the fan controller IC and look up its datasheet.",roothorick,125,29,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1apkag/protip_if_you_run_into_a_bios_with_really_cryptic/,"Chances are, those settings are dumped raw upon some register on the fan controller IC, and the datasheet of said controller will give you a very good idea what they do. For instance, on a motherboard I recently had the displeasure to work with, it had settings something like:

* ""PWM Duty Off""
* ""PWM Duty Start""
* ""Start PWM Value""
* ""Smart Fan Slope""

I was like ""The hell?"" SpeedFan told me it has an IT8712F-J and an IT8716F. (Actually, IT8712 revision J doesn't exist; it's just a part of IT8716F that was engineered to be backwards compatible with the 8712s.) On page 118 of [the datasheet](http://www.rom.by/files/IT8716F_V0.3.pdf) I found a quite detailed and very technical breakdown of the algorithm used and how the values affect it. It also revealed that a value the BIOS treats as a 7-bit integer is actually interpreted as a fixed-point value with three decimal bits. gg Biostar.

So, for this particular motherboard, a Biostar MCP6P M2+:

NOTE: the IC uses the values 0...127 to represent 0%...100% duty cycle (it's a PWM thing, basically 50% is half power and etc). How a percentage maps to a particular RPM is completely fan-specific (and some fans are assholes and will change RPM based on temperature in addition to the PWM value so it doesn't directly map at all). Math it out and make sure the speed is hitting 127 about 5 degrees before your processor's thermal limit, and you'll be fine. If your heatsink+fan is actually up to the job. **It's important to note here that a lot of fans need to be as high as 40%, or even higher, to even start. Test your fan and see what it does.**

* PWM Duty Off: In degrees Celsius. If the CPU temperature falls to below *5 degrees less than* this setting (the BIOS is hardcoded to write a 5-degree hysteresis to the IC's register), the fan will be turned off entirely (3-pin), or set to its lowest setting possible (which may or may not be off depending on the fan) (4-pin)
* PWM Duty Start: In degrees Celsius. Call this ""S"". See below.
* Start PWM Value: Call this ""V"". When the ""PWM Duty Start"" temperature is exceeded, the fan is turned on at this speed.
* Smart Fan Slope: I'll call it ""K"". This is really complicated -- I'll give it its own set of paragraphs.

Okay, Smart Fan Slope. I'm going to call it ""K"" for brevity. The BIOS misrepresents this value: it's not an integer, it's a fixed-point value with three decimal bits. For the layman: take the value you want it to be, and multiply by 8: put the product into the BIOS field. Yes, this means the maximum is 15.875. Deal with it. And yes, you can have decimal amounts. I think the IC rounds calculations internally but I'm not 100% sure.

Each degree that the processor's temperature increases (well call its temperature C), and said temp is above ""PWM Duty Start"", the fan speed is set to V + (C - S) * K, unless it's already at that speed or higher. Likewise, each degree that the processor's temperature *de*creases, the fan speed is set to V + (C+5 - S) * K (or simply V if this would put it below V), unless it's already at the calculated speed or lower. (5 is the hysteresis, and again, it's hardcoded into the BIOS on this board.) Obviously, both are limited to 127 max.

So for the fan to hit max speed at S+x degrees, V + (K * x) must be equal to or greater than 127. This puts a lower bound on x (up to 8 degrees) depending on the abilities of your fan, since K must be less than 15.875. Again, deal with it.

Hope this helps someone.

I'm now looking at a Dell that won't charge despite having a new charger of the correct specification, because [To charge the battery, you need a genuine Dell AC adapter.](http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/19397185/19929422.aspx)  I read on Wikipedia that Dell PCs [""are notable for using proprietary power wiring on their power supplies and motherboards""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX#Issues_with_Dell_power_supplies).

I'm sick of this shit and I'm not buying from them again.  One manufacturer I've had good experiences with is Samsung (NC10 still going strong), but TBH I can't be sure they don't pull this kind of crap too.

Does anyone maintain a list of disreputable manufacturers like this so I can avoid them?  Or a list of manufacturers known not to do this, so I can buy from them?

EDIT: I'm keeping a list.  Any additions and corrections are much appreciated.

EDIT: Please note I'm *not* looking for lock-free business/enterprise-level hardware; if a company is shitty enough to put locks on *anything* it sells then it goes in the disreputable list.

1336745773.0,85,self.hardware,ti6e5,I have tried multiple routers over the past years and they all suck. What router should i get?,Shurikane,102,17,189,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/ti6e5/i_have_tried_multiple_routers_over_the_past_years/,"**TL;DR: I am looking for a router with at least four ports, wireless capability and port forwarding.  If I can assign static IPs to the machines on my network, that's awesome.  If it has a decent UPnP, that's great.  It must ABSOLUTELY be rock-solid reliable and resistant to obscure voodoo magic.**

Before I begin, I want to state that I have had a supernaturally bad luck with anything involving networking.  Most machines I've been given at work have severe VPN or wifi issues that prevent me from connecting to specific places.  Of the four cables I ran in the home eight years ago, two of them flat out stopped working.  Of the routers I had at two different homes, things went like this:

* Linksys Wireless - Couldn't wireless its way through a gyproc wall.
* Linksys 4-port - Randomly entered into a panic mode and refused any and all connections, including to its internal admin page, until it was unplugged for a full minute.  I could've cooked an egg on top of it too.
* D-Link DI-624 with Wireless - Crashed and self-rebooted at such breakneck speed that I was banned from a chatroom for join-flooding at 2:00 AM while I was asleep.
* Inexq 4-port - Modifying the virtual server parameters caused the router to immediately crash.
* Homemade m0n0wall box - Both NICs physically failed after a week.
* Bell Sympatico router-modem combo - Oftentimes lost connection for no apparent reason, was unable to save port forward settings.
* Linksys-Cisco WRT54GL - One of the physical ports became inoperative, and then one fine day the device spontaneously reset itself to factory settings after giving me a dazzling light show worthy of a dance rave.  UPnP seems to work sometimes, and not some other times.  I did not bother installing DD-WRT on it (yet) and anyway my dealbreaker was with the port crapping out.

The reason I do not simply RMA the WRT54GL is because this is the only router I have on hand at the moment, I am moving soon and will leave it behind so family members can still use it.

And no, I do not have this heart condition that makes me set off alarms in retail stores.

*Whenever I ask for router recommendations, the thread degenerates into a gigantic flamewar where if I gather all the opinions together, I conclude that every router make and model in existence is simultaneously the best and the worst thing to ever be invented on the face of the planet.  Hopefully asking on Reddit will provide me with more... sensible answers.*

**Option #1** is to buy another WRT54GL on the basis that the one I got was a lemon.

**Option #2** is to grab that ASUS RT-N66U that I've seen in some recommendations, although for 200$ this thing better damn cook dinner as well and last until the fourth millenium.  I'm usually told that the thing can withstand a nuclear blast, but that the price is simply too steep for a residence-oriented router.

**Option #3** is to grab a lower-grade ASUS router.  Or other company and pray for the best (see italic text above for why I say that).

Please, please pretty please with a cherry on top, please help me find a router that will finally end my 10-year long woes and give me networking peace of mind at last.

So yesterday the GTX680 Mac Edition came out. My good friend and I wanted to have a little gaming session this weekend - he has a Mac Pro (with windows for gaming) and there has not been any significant upgrade for graphic cards for his machine for a long while (otherwise it's a very solid machine). He actually wanted to build a new gaming pc before our gaming session - but we found out about the new EVGA card for Mac.

However the deal was either we can get it until friday this week or he doesn't want it (and would go for the new PC instead).

So I started researching all sorts of online shops in Germany and the UK (I speak German he doesn't so I was at an advantage) but nothing. They had the card in their offer but it was either listed not in stock and waiting to get stocked or available by the end of april etc. I totally understand as this card is not for everyone. Usually people use mac pro's for video editing or 3D, high end photo processing / not for gaming. I was losing all hope when suddenly I just thought I'd call EVGA in Germany.

We went through the ordering process on the phone - they assured me that the card would be at our address by friday / but you know how deliveries work so we were still nervous we wouldn't get it on time. 

So after placing the order I called again to ask wether we could just go drive to Munich to pick up the card (we live in Slovakia it's about 10 - 12 hours there and back). 

The guy I spoke to told us that it's a very long drive and we shouldn't go through the hassle and promised he would do everything in his possible to assure that the card will be delivered in time.

Today the card arrived - in less than 24 hours - a card which was just out and nowhere to be found. I just want to thank EVGA for their awesome service and thought I'd mention it on Reddit.

Maybe this is normal in the States but living in a pretty disfunctional country like Slovakia this really impressed me and made me happy.

**TL;DR: Guy at EVGA made sure we get our card in time for our gaming session - it arrived the next day Germany to Slovakia**",,False,,t5_2qh18,False,,,True,t3_1bzfbi,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1bzfbi/just_want_to_give_a_big_up_to_evga_europe/,

Strangest thing I've ever seen building a computer.",InvisiblePants,100,14,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1b0y2x/update_so_the_graphics_card_wasnt_actually_doa/,"So I figured I would post an update to my [previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1axlu3/so_i_think_my_gpu_is_dead_on_arrival_though_i/), and maybe get some more advice now that I know more about the situation.  Not sure if there's much to be helped at this point, though.

After all the rigorous testing over this weekend, I finally got the chance to test my card 2 other rigs, and it worked perfectly.  BIOS auto detected and set display adapters, everything worked as intended.  I plug it back in mine, and nothing.  One of these machines I tested in was z77 chipset, same as my own, so we can rule out the chipset not playing nice with 7970s.

I then tested more gpus in my own board, and all worked perfectly.  I even tested a 295, with a 6 and an 8 pin connector, so I know my power supply and cables are fine.  All the gpu slots in my mobo worked with all cards besides my 7970.  It would seem that my 7970 just isn't playing nice with my specific UD3H board...

Except for the kicker.  The absolute *strangest* thing I've ever seen.  I plugged my friend's 295 in the 3.0 x16 slot, and mine in the 2.0 x8, and the machine booted.  I check device manager, and it detects my 7970 perfectly, and I can even use it in games.  I reboot and unplug the 295, suddenly the 7970 is invisible.  

The result of all this is a motherboard that works perfectly fine with everything except for dealing with a solo 7970, and a 7970 that works perfectly in all situations except placed solo in my z77x-ud3h.

I even called the microcenter tech support to see if they had any insight into this specific problem, but nothing.  The guy on the line thought it was the strangest thing, and just suggested I return both card and board, get another 7970, and a completely different board.  The guy was even laughing at how ridiculous the situation turned out to be.

I plan on doing this unless one of you tech whiz guys manages to identify something I'm doing wrong.  I love the board and I love the card, and I'd especially love not having to unbuild my whole setup and swap out mobos, but it seems they just don't play nice together.",,False,,t5_2qh18,1364312470.0,,,True,t3_1b0y2x,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1b0y2x/update_so_the_graphics_card_wasnt_actually_doa/,

TBH, I still prefer their decade old 6.5 drivers (which only works with old mice) - but I have always loved their hardware. 

They *do* make up for their software, though - a while ago, my mouse ([MX Revolution](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/428/130)) that I purchased **in 2007** stopped working. The transmitter and mouse both appeared to work (USB device found, mouse lighting up nicely), but they weren't on speaking terms. I followed their support guides to no avail. Usually, I'd just have tossed it since it is way over it's warranty and more than what I'd normally expect a manufacturer to help me with, but since I'd read positively about their service on Reddit, I thought I'd try contacting them. 

To my surprise, **they sent me a brand new mouse**, free of charge. It arrived today; it's the newer [Performance Mouse MX](http://www.logitech.com/en-us/mice-pointers/mice/devices/5845). While I preferred the design and feel of the old one, I am not going to even contemplate complaining about service so awesome.

I'm inclined to believe that the extraordinary service is because it was a ""premium"" mouse (cost more than $100), but I am still amazed at this service.

One of the parts I ordered was an AC Ryan High-Output Dual-CCFT Blacklight for the interior of my case. It worked properly for about two months, and after that point, would only turn on intermittently. I was pretty sure it was an overheating issue, but didn't ever bother to fix it or seek help for what seemed to be a defective product. Hey, it happens, and sometimes we just have more important things to do.

Long story short, I happened to be repairing a server at work (which is in the Rochester NY area) which is local to FrozenCPU's store. After making half a dozen phone calls trying to find a special SaS -&gt; Sata cable, guess which place was the *only* place that had them in stock? I took a quick drive over to see them, checked the cable with my probe, and sure enough, it was the correct cable at a great price (about half the price of what I would have spent elsewhere). The counter guys were very helpful and very courteous.

Being the ÜberNerd that I am, I had a lengthy conversation about computer parts and mod accessories. I actually asked them if they had had any issues with the AC Ryan Cathode kits they sold a few years ago. They informed me that they had stopped selling the kits as they had some issues with them. Not only did they apologize for the power inverter that prematurely expired, they actually handed me a brand new part to replace the old one, without me even asking for it!

This is an excellent example of superb customer service and a real commitment to total customer satisfaction. I applaud them for going above and beyond what most customers typically receive from companies they deal with.

Thanks, FrozenCPU, I really appreciate it! Keep up the good work!

From time to time there are stories about very good/bad customer support in r/hardware, so I thought I'd share mine. I've just had an awesome experience with Logitech's support and I'm very happy about it, so I thought I'd share it, because... well... they deserve some publicity for what they did :)

So I own a wireless keyboard/mouse solution from Logitech (the MK250). About a week ago I noticed that the middle mouse button wasn't working anymore. I played around a bit and it pretty much looked like a device error I could do nothing about. Since I read a story on reddit of someone who contacted Logitech due to a faulty device and they gave him a coupon for 50% off to buy a replacement, I figured it was worth a shot.

Note that my MK250 was out of warranty. I'd even lost the original bill that usually acts as proof of ownership/warranty... But oh well, it's worth a try, right?

I called the hotline, and got transferred immediately to a tier1 technician. Explained my problem in two sentences, and the technician just said ""ok, sounds like a mechanical problem. Just mail me a picture with the serial number, the referal number I give you and your address"". So I did, and like 5 minutes later I got their reply: ""sorry, but we don't produce the MK250 anymore. I can offer you an MK260 (the upgraded model). Would you like the international layout or the german one?""... The whole process took about 10 minutes on Friday. Today they sent me an email confirming that they shipped the keyboard and that they'd cover the shipping cost. :-)

**TL;DR: Logitech got me a new keyboard/mouse for my old one even though it wasn't in warranty anymore, even though the old one was still basically working (and I can keep it) and better yet, I got an upgrade, too! :)**",,False,,t5_2qh18,False,,,True,t3_tb4jd,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/tb4jd/logitechs_customer_support_is_awesome/,

I have 4GiB in the testing laptop and I need at least 8GiB for the virtual machines, but I thought I might as well get the full 16GiB which it can take.

But I have left it too long it seems.  16GiB of DDR3 SODIMM RAM om Crucial has gone up from around £60 to over £90 in the last few weeks.  That's quite a sharp and sudden increase.

I think RAM may have been so cheap as the handful of RAM manufacturers over-supplied during the Christmas period, with the expectation/hope that Windows 8 devices would be a huge sales success.

Do you think that's the reason DDR3 prices were so low, and now they have just normalised after reduced production due to low demand and oversupply?

The reason I am asking is because I can always borrow another 4GiB for the testing, for the time being, and get the 16GiB when/if prices drop again.  Or maybe I should just get the 16GiB RAM now and accept that I have thrown £30 down the toilet by not acting fast enough?

&gt;**【Market View】TrendForce: DRAM Price Increase to Continue, 4GB Module Price Sees 11% Monthly Increase**

&gt;Published Feb.5 2013, 17:21 PM (GMT+8) 

&gt;TrendForce: DRAM Price Increase to Continue, 4GB Module Price Sees 11% Monthly Increase

&gt;According to DRAMeXchange, a division of global market research firm TrendForce, as top-tier DRAM makers continue to reduce shipments of commodity DRAM, price has become a secondary consideration for PC OEMs as their top priority is to secure their supply source. This change in strategy has strengthened DRAM module prices, bringing 4GB module price to a high of US$18 for the second half of the month, a US$0.50 or nearly 3% increase over the first half of January. Average 4GB price for the entire month rose by 11.11%, a rare occurrence in the past few years due to continually weak demand on the DRAM market.

&gt;In addition to the contract price rebound, TrendForce also notes more PC OEMs are turning to module makers to secure supply. The two leading Korean DRAM makers have stated they will continue to cut commodity DRAM production in the future. The third and fourth largest suppliers, Micron and Elpida, will be making product mix adjustments after their merger is complete, and Taiwanese manufacturers are gradually backing out of the DRAM industry. As a result, supply is decreasing rapidly, causing PC OEMs procurement difficulties.

&gt;PC makers are showing a desire to gradually increase inventory levels, and they are turning to module makers that they have not cooperated with as much in the past. Thus, the proportion of supply from module makers is rising, with some deals closing even higher than contract prices and approaching spot prices. The highest priced transaction was conducted at US$20, a good sign for contract prices. TrendForce expects DRAM contract price will continue rising throughout the first quarter due to these supply changes.

&gt;Rising PC DRAM Price to Slow PC Content Per Unit Growth

&gt;As suppliers decrease commodity DRAM production, PC DRAM contract price increased over 10% in January. Both suppliers and buyers are optimistic that contract prices will continue on an uptrend, eventually exceeding the Korean DRAM makers’ fully loaded cost. Global PC DRAM prices will have a chance to surpass the US$20 mark, which will benefit DRAM makers’ profit margins. However, price increases will also suppress content per unit growth, making it unlikely that the 20% growth that has been seen in previous years will continue.

 
&gt;According to TrendForce research, notebook content per unit will only increase from 4.1GB to 4.7GB this year, a mere 14.7% increase and the slowest growth experienced in years. With the simplified, optimized design of Windows 8, there is no need for significant content per unit increases. Furthermore, as BOM cost for mainstream notebooks has already fallen below US$500, there is little room for DRAM cost increases. Currently, average 4GB module contract price is US$17.75, which represents 3.5% of BOM cost. If prices continue to rise, reaching the US$23-25 range, DRAM will exceed 5% of BOM cost. Therefore, major PC makers are delaying content growth due to cost considerations. As a result, the content per unit growth this year may drop from the originally forecasted 14.7% to approximately 10%, at 4.5GB per unit, which will have a detrimental effect on PC DRAM consumption.

&gt;TrendForce indicates that the industry is generally reserved towards PC shipments in 2013. With further shrinkage of the PC DRAM outlet due to the DRAM price rebound and suppressed content per unit growth, it is more certain than ever that DRAM suppliers will continue cutting commodity DRAM production.

Order a monitor, and if it's got *anything* wrong with it out of the box, they'll ship you a new one (expedited) while you're on the phone with them...before they even get the old one back in (obviously).  No extra warranty or anything.

I just found this out after ordering a 23"" 1080p monitor that came in with a **single** dead pixel; I called them up and the new monitor should be in on Monday.  I didn't have to pay a restocking fee, and shipping it back without the original packaging apparently isn't an issue either.  Shit, Asus's warranty doesn't even cover that (It's got to be like 3 pixels within an inch of each other or some BS like that, and they have different policies for dead, stuck, and hot pixels).  I still can't get my mind around this...best dead pixel policy ever.

So yea...thanks Amazon, you've won me over, even if I do have to pay $10 extra to get it from you guys instead of another seller.  Well worth it IMO.

**edit:**  At the risk of sounding like an entitled jackass, I'm going to point out that Amazon is doing what *everybody*, especially the manufacturers, *should* be doing.  A dead pixel means the product is defective, and replacing a defective product is something that's expected.

ASUS will not honor 2 year warranty,exdr3am,110,35,62,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/1dqrvo/help_asus_will_not_honor_2_year_warranty/,"I need some advice on how I should proceed with this case. I bought an ASUS laptop model K53SV-XP1 in October 2011 from an ASUS reseller in Canada which supposedly has a 2 year global warranty as stated on the ASUS website itself. Upon the first week of usage I discovered there was a hardware problem with the dvd-drive as it will open by itself randomly from time to time. Since this was the only issue, I did not want to go through the hassle of sending it in to ASUS and be without a laptop for at least 2 weeks; Nevertheless, I called ASUS to verify that there is indeed a 2 year warranty on my laptop as there was an asterisk on the warranty line indicating it differed by country. The call agent whom I spoke to told me that it is indeed under a 2 year warranty and the asterisk was there to imply that it is only for ASUS laptops purchased in Canada or USA; Furthermore, he said that all ASUS laptops have their ASUS 360 warranty as advertised on the website(which is a 2 year warranty, free 2 way shipping etc.).  

Slightly after a year, whenever I use my laptop for gaming I will experience a major graphics lag and my sound system will start crackling. And ever since that happened, even when I play videos on my computer there will be an intermittent lag/cutting of the videos sometimes. I have also been experiencing blue screen random shut down problems for no reason. Hence, I decided that it was high time I send my laptop in for a repair. However to my aghast, the caller agent insists that my warranty has expired as it is a 1 year warranty. After demanding to speak to the manager, he said that they do not have a manager but have a supervisor. Even after speaking to the supervisor he insists that my warranty is 1 year which doesn’t even make sense since it clearly states on multiple websites online that this model has a 2 year global warranty. I have sent in a request for an escalation on this case on their website but have not received a reply and the only other option I can think of is to sue them in small claims court. What do you guys think?

Why would they do this? Especially since this particular model is by Samsung and is advertised for gaming, and gaming requires a lot of left shifting, and making it half the size is just ridiculous.

1355101021.0,78,self.hardware,14kr4o,Large RAM Upgrades - A warning if you're using a small boot SSD (pagefile/hibernate).,mckirkus,105,27,141,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/14kr4o/large_ram_upgrades_a_warning_if_youre_using_a/,"I grabbed 16GB of DDR3 for $54 and wasn't really thinking about the non-volatile storage implications.  Turns out it had a pretty big impact on the PageFile as well as Hibernation file sizes.  Going from 4GB to 16 consumed almost all of the remaining space on my 80GB Intel SSD.  

Hibernation basically saves your RAM to disk so it can go into a very low power state, then reads it back to RAM when it wakes up to raise its cubs.  I didn't want to get rid of my Page File entirely since some programs rely on it so I just moved it to my media HDD where 16GB is a drop in the bucket.  

Now I have 20Gigs free on my SSD and all is once again right/write in my storage world.  Merry Festivus and see the link below for how to do it courtesy of THG:

I have manually assigned a name to each I.P. address that connects to the wireless network in my house. There are three Xbox 360s, five computers, one PS 3, and one Wii. There are I.P. addresses that are new and foreign that connect from time to time and there is a blank SSID that has unusually high security for a residential area and duplicate honeypots. They have no SSID, BSSID or Mac address but with net stumbler and backtrack I can ""see"" them.
They have WPA 2 AES encryption which is very unusual in my area. I'm the only one else who has it...LOL.

 I think my Mom is the problem. My parents are from Pakistan and she makes calls to Pakistan everyday and talks for 4-5 hours with MANY different relatives in the tribal areas. She has an addiction to talking on the phone. We had a friend in the police force/military who says he had it on good authority that for a time we were definitely monitored because of my Mom's heavy phone traffic. We also hear all kinds of weird whirs and clicks a few seconds after we use the phones.

Am I being paranoid or Am I under surveillance? I really don't care about the phones. REALLY. I understand why we should be recorded but I don't want the Feds knowing what kind of porn I watch....MILF...okay there I said it. I have an Oedipus complex.

I had to RMA it because of coil whine (I'm sure you guys are familiar with it; not really a functional issue, but an annoyance). XFX was more than happy to take it back for me, and then following that I had an issue where one of my fans went out on the GPU. I messaged XFX and asked them if it was possible to send me a new fan for the GPU so that I  wouldn't have to pay for shipping, and I could just swap it out myself and not be without it for a week (I tested temps, and it was still running a cool 59c while gaming). A few days later, not only did I receive the fan, I received an entire new cooling unit for my GPU, a few screws later and I was back to optimal temps.

I just wanted to post this here because I have been so happy with XFX's customer support, they really stand behind their products with their lifetime warranties, and they also do such a great job of putting you first, as opposed to making you jump through hoops.

TL;DR
GPU fan died, received entire cooling unit, XFX customer support is the best!

Used razor blades for the de-lidding, had some Stanley blades as well but I didn't really need them (couldn't even fit them under IHS until I was pretty much done).

It was a bit nerve racking separating the IHS, cut myself once with one of the razor blades when it popped out and headed straight for my thumb (sliced through my nail too), only a small cut but kinda sucked because it took ages to stop bleeding which put a delay on the de-lidding process. And after finishing everything I almost had a heart attack when I booted up my PC and was greeted by a ""Press F1 to enter setup"" screen; then I actually read the text which was just saying a new CPU has been detected (have no idea why though) and relaxed a lot more when it loaded windows without a hitch.

The lapping was pretty much a 'why the hell not' thing, while it probably has zero effect with my current lol-worthy Hyper 212 EVO I'm hoping it has some effect whenever I get around to Liquid Pro'ing a waterblock to it. Didn't get it completely mirror finish but was close enough to see reflections pretty clearly and there were no visible bumps in the IHS.

I replaced the stock TIM with Liquid Pro, which not only seems to be the best performing but shouldn't suffer from drying out which has apparently been reported by users of more traditional TIMs. I used the included cotton buds to spread it onto the die and inside of the IHS, I was going to use some latex gloves I had but apparently they've been sitting around too long and have gone a yellowish colour. Personally I would recommend trying with gloves rather than the buds because I don't think I was able to get a good even spread on the die, hopefully I made up with it by applying it fairly well to the IHS but still a bit worrying (luckily temps are all pretty good so it seems like it wasn't too much of a fuck-up).

Ran IBT on high and had HWMonitor + RealTemp running for temps (they seem to be most commonly used but give different readings). Settings for the runs were; 4.4GHz -0.015v, 4.6GHz +0.030v, 4.8GHz +0.100v (stock vCore is approximately 1.2v). I probably needed more vCore on 4.8 to get it completely stable as IBT's freeze test was stuttering a bit however it passed the test and as I don't plan on making it my 24/7 clock I didn't bother trying to fine tune it, nice to see that I could get reasonable temps at 4.8GHz with a 212 EVO though.

I backed up all my files to an external, shut it down and unplugged everything.  Opened up the case, dusted a bit on the inside, dropped in the new drive, connected the included wires, plugged everything back in, closed her up, and crossed my fingers that I did it all correctly, and restarted. 

Checked my startup menu to make sure the drive was recognized, which it was, success!

Loaded the cloning Cd that came with the drive and waited a few hours for it to do its thing and let it shut down on its own ( it was an option on the clone software)

Switched her back on but immediately hit the F10 key to get to my startup menu and attempted to reboot from the new drive.   

Success! I am a tech wizard!  Well at least in my own brain.  All files accounted for, the transition is seamless to my wife who is the heavier user and I didn't have to buy a whole new one. Thanks for reading.

1324560112.0,64,self.hardware,nmkzp,Just a tip for 6950 users,opzbreh,88,24,40,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/nmkzp/just_a_tip_for_6950_users/,"So my friend bought me a 6950 (MSI Twin Frozr iii 1GB Power Edition) for Christmas and we encountered some minor issues that did not have any apparent solutions in a google search, 120Hz monitors and flashing to a 6970.

So I have a 120Hz monitor and when we plugged it in, i noticed that the desktop was not as smooth as it should be. We look in the Catalyst drivers and the monitor's refresh rate was locked at 60Hz. That caused me some worry, looking for drivers for the monitor and checking Catalyst for some extra settings. The solution was to use the DVI port on top, next to the hdmi and display ports, and not the DVI port on bottom next to the heat exhaust. Yay, problem solved.

Next, flashing the 6950 to a 6970. *Edit: Most people suggest that you have a reference model for a chance of success in unlocking the shaders*

So my friend and I have not flashed a video card in a while, so we googled it and came up with this [tutorial](http://www.vortez.net/articles_pages/msi_r6950_twin_froz_iii_power_edition_unlocking,1.html ""DO NOT USE THE BIOS IN THIS TUTORIAL""). The tutorial seemed simple enough, just make a bootable usb drive^1 , and put atiflash and the included bios onto the drive. Why should it not work? *""MSI made the bios...""*

After putting the contents of the file from that site onto the usb drive and backing up the original bios using [GPU-Z](http://www.techpowerup.com/gpuz/), we booted into dos and followed the instructions carefully,

    ""atiflash -p -f 0 r6950pex.bin"".

Hm, flash seems successful. Reboot. Nothing. So after a little panic, we flipped the switch on the 6950 to the other side (Silent option) and were able to boot successfully. So when we boot back into Windows, we look at the ""6970 bios"" and we notice that it is only 64KB rather than 128KB like our backup. We noticed that before we flashed, but thought it was safe nonetheless, which proved wrong.

Our next step was to restore the bios that was flashed badly. We booted back into dos using the good bios. Once in dos, we flipped the switch to the messed up bios (Performance option), ran atiflash with our backup, and rebooted. All was good, but that wasn't good enough. We still wanted a 6970.

We searched a little more and a link mentioned using [RBE](http://www.techpowerup.com/rbe/) to edit your bios to unlock the extra shaders. So we download RBE, ignored the tutorials, and searched for some option to unlock the shaders. The option happened to be on the ""Additional features"" page with a check box under the label ""Unlock 6950 -&gt; 6970"". We checked the 6970 shader count option, and went to save our new bios. The save prompt wanted to save the new bios as a .rom file rather than a .bin file, and we were a little weary about that. We saved it as ""CaymanGood.rom"" anyway.

We boot into dos, run the command

    ""atiflash -f -p 0 CaymanG~1.rom"".

Flash seems successful. Reboot. Get post sounds, and we're good!

Lessons learned/reinforced:

1. Always make a backup if you are going to mess with/flash anything.

2. Don't blindly take/use information without doing some research.

1321608625.0,63,self.hardware,mgrtp,Totally silent computing - move the PC to another room.,,93,30,100,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/mgrtp/totally_silent_computing_move_the_pc_to_another/,"I've been reading about quiet PC components for years, looking up dB levels at different loads etc...  I built a somewhat standard quiet computer a couple years ago and still found it too noisy.  The loudest part ended up being the power supply which was one of the quietest ones around.  I never really got into the water cooling / foam insulators etc. and in my case I don't think they would have made a difference that was worth the hassle.

I thought about moving the computer into a large closet but I worried about heat in there so I bought some cables and relocated the computer into another room which when the door is closed I can't hear at all (EXCELLENT!!!).

It's a full desktop (which I choose for configurability and fixability) so your results may vary if you're connecting lower powered components like a laptop or something but here's what I used:

25 feet DVI Digital Male to Male Dual Link Cable - from dedicated video card to monitor input (~$15)

32 feet (10 meters) USB 2.0 Active Extension Cable A Male to A Female - from USB on desktop to monitor USB cable (monitor has a built in hub which I connect the keyboard and mouse to) (~$15)

25 feet 3.5mm Audio Cable Male to Female (2x) - one for the desktop audio output to my computer speakers, one for the microphone. (~$8)

Everything works great, highly recommended!

In my case the DVI connection is solid, no sparkles or video loss, no noise on the audio cables either.  USB connection is solid, I don't notice any input lag on mouse or keyboard.  My computer speakers have a headphone jack so I can use that if I want.  I can crank the desktop fans up and still be totally silent.  For USB stuff like thumb drives I can plug it into my monitor.  If I ever need to use firewire / DVD / power switch / reset switch / eSATA / (never) then it's just a few steps away.

The only sound I hear is from using input devices (keyboard / mouse) and audio from speakers (good!) and if you put your ear RIGHT next to the monitor you can barely hear the LCD monitor (probably the CFL or power buzzing) which is not noticeable at sitting distance.  It's so nice and silent that I find myself getting back into music, it's so much more pleasant when you don't have to crank the music to hear subtleties or just to listen at low volume.  Also nice if you want to keep the computer running while you sleep if your keyboard / monitor / mouse are in your bedroom.

Read up on max cable lengths for each type of connection (wikipedia etc...).  In my case I pushed the recommended max and read some reviews about different cables / experiences and got something long enough for my needs but not too long.  Everything works great, much cheaper than quiet / no fan PCs (which can limit you as far as configurations / cost).  Using the same wires I could run some super overclocked screaming PC and still be totally silent, no special hardware or endlessly tweaking components and PC case for noise levels.  Audiophiles will probably be interested too, you could run an optical cable to a DAC / AMP in another room and use the same keyboard / mouse / monitor setup or just VNC to the desktop from another computer (as a remote control) if you want.  These days tablet computers are totally silent also so that's another thing to think about.

In my case I was able to run all cables under doors so there was no carpentry work.",,False,,t5_2qh18,True,,,True,t3_mgrtp,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/mgrtp/totally_silent_computing_move_the_pc_to_another/,

###+ $30 off w/ promo code EMCXPXN54, ends 6/13. Ends today. $79!!


So, in Febuary I picked up the case. The thing is nothing short of gorgeous when it comes to [aesthetics to the eye](http://legitreviews.com/images/reviews/2020/Define_R4_62.jpg). Inside and out, it is pure beauty. 

At [sub-$110](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811352020), you can't go wrong.

I'm going to quickly cover the case and why I think it's amazing, but I'd really like to touch on why I think the company is amazing.

**The Case**

* ***Build Quality***  -  I cannot say anything bad about the build quality here. The sound dampening material is the same stuff I have seen in studios, which is pretty amazing considering the price point on this. Solid construction I must say.

* ***Cooling Abilities*** - I have ran the 800D with my current build, everything the same. The difference here is this case is half the size of the monster Obsidian, and it is because of that that I switched to this mid tower. The cooling on these is very much close in comparison. I am running a 6gb 7970 OC GHZ edition, no Overclock except for how it came. I am running at roughly 39c at idle, and I max at 58c under load. In the Obsidian, I would be 1-2 degrees below that at load. Nothing much here.

* ***Cable Guiding*** - The read side of the case has amazing cabling options. Again comparable to the massive 800D.

* ***Quiet*** - Other than the blue LED on the front, which isn't so bright it lights up your room like a daft punk concert, you would never know this thing is running. I can put my ear literally next to it and not hear it.


* ***Overall Thoughts*** - Great case, perfect size for a mid tower in my opinion. Opening the door there is only 2 optical drive slots, and the rest is fine. That is the ONLY downside I have seen to this case. Now, I don't run an optical drive so that is not a problem for me. I install all my OS from USB obviously. This is 2013. Not 1999.

**The Company**

Okay, so here is where shit gets awesome. Fractal Design is what every company should strive for in customer service. Quick breakdown, the front of the case is removable, and it set in place by locking plastic columns. It works great, but Amazon fucked up their shipping and it came broken. Okay, fine. In fact it still held on amazingly well with only 2 of the 6 prongs, but I am one of these people who think if it isn't perfect I have to fix it.

So I call up FD. Someone answers the phone on the second ring. No machine, no bullshit. Dude is amazingly nice. I told him my situation, he asked which case, and said hold just oooone second. 20 seconds later he is on the line ""Yep, we got them available I'm gonna send you right now. What is your address?"". What? Seriously? Free? No fucking way!! Give dude my address, 30 minutes later I have an email with tracking info from fed ex. This was last Friday. 20 minutes before closing. It's Wednesday, and here it is.

[Proof](http://i.imgur.com/gMxvMqj.jpg).

So yeah, that is my spiel. Bitchin' case, bitchin' company.. Awesome fucking people. I seriously suggest you guys give anything these dudes make a try and if in the area stop by and ask them if you can touch their dicks. Just because that's how much you care.

Edit: Thanks for your replies so far! For those asking: I broke one by carrying it around with me in my laptop bag (stupid me). As for the rest, the scroll wheels eventually go out on these mice if you use the scroll wheel as button. Given, I use these mice 15+ hours a day, 7 days a week.


Edit edit: Someone suggested I contact ""legendary"" Logitech to see if they will replace the mouse. I'll try doing that and see what they say (though it's been 10 years...).

I even remember having some screws left after assembly and I could not figure out where they belonged to. And yes, I did take pictures.

Oh and even worse, replacing a hard drive on an iBook. Apple engineering sucks :(

Good engineering is not just performance and design, but also providing easy ways for maintenance. This is what Lenovo manages to do. What other brands stand out for great engineering experiences

1318677668.0,62,self.hardware,ld2ig,The Truth about Maximum Core Temperature for Intel Processors,Scotty1992,78,16,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/ld2ig/the_truth_about_maximum_core_temperature_for/,"I see a lot of confusion on reddit and elsewhere regarding maximum intel processor temperatures. Many people visit the intel website, find their processor and look at the 'TCASE' temperature specification (which is for example, 72.6 degrees for a Core i5-2500K) and then assume that the case temperature is the same as core (junction) temperature. Then they visit forums or reddit and state that a core temperature reading from a program like 'coretemp' above the tcase specification constitutes overheating and throttling. This is NOT correct.

For desktop intel processors, intel only specifies a maximum case temperature, which is the area on top of the integrated heat spreader. By taking this and the thermal power of a processor into consideration a heatsink can be designed. However, programs such as coretemp display the core temperature (in reality it's more complex, but that doesn't matter for the purposes of this discussion) not the case temperature. Given that heat flows from from the cores to the top of the heatspreader and into the heatsink, actual core temperature will always be hotter than the area on top of the heat-spreader - thus the core temperature at which a processor will throttle will always be somewhat higher than the tcase specification given by intel. 

Therefore, processors such as the i5-2500 do not throttle at 72.6 degrees, they will throttle at a temperature of around 80 degrees. And I think they trip at about 100 degrees. This is true for most intel processors.

1314202051.0,60,self.hardware,jszcn,"Hey reddit, I need some help convincing a stubborn executive that backing up data from the SAN to the SAME SAN is an extremely bad idea... and that snapshots aren't backups... among other things. Details inside.",LoganPhyve,78,18,56,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/jszcn/hey_reddit_i_need_some_help_convincing_a_stubborn/,"I'll give a brief synopsis of what's going on here.

I'm the SysAdmin for a SMB tech company. I LOVE my job and the people I work for/with. That being said, I don't want to bail out... 

I've recently brought the company through a complete infrastructure upgrade - we've moved from archaic, unreliable baremetal machines to a Two-Host ESXi virtual environment. We're running an 8TB usable EMC VNXe San as a shared datastore between both hosts to take advantage of VMware HA and Vmotion. The VNXe is keeping up no problem, as are the hosts. It's a solid build.

We need to completely overhaul our backup policies and practices. They're almost non-existent. I'm responsible for multiple Tb's of sensitive accounting, drawing, product, and customer data. Backups are a must, and I'm terrified that we're going to lose something important (after having a baremetal mail server lose 4.5gb /a complete month of ALL employee mailboxes). Needless to say we've made HUGE leaps and bounds towards safety and stable operations, but we're in backup no-mans-land.

We've had several discussions on backup hardware strategy and what equipment I need to follow best practices and ensure we're lawfully compliant as well as ensuring multiple redundancy for our backups (on-site for quick VM or file level recovery, off site for catastrophic disaster). If I'm going to take the credit for designing and deploying a backup strategy, I expect no less than perfection in my work based upon my high standards for ethics and delivering the very best of what I'm paid to. 

There's a few problems here. My company president is absolutely convinced of the following, which is destroying my opportunity to do things **The right way**:

* That Snapshots are backups and should be used all the time (It burns!)

* We should be backing up to the SAN (THE SAME SAN THAT HOLDS DATA NOW)

* That backing the SAN up to the same SAN won't have any network or disk iops impact

* That backing up to the SAN won't have any hardware wear-and-tear impact

* That we don't need a second mass-storage appliance for backing up

* That we should buy a tape library and a pile of tapes to back up to, if anything

etc etc

I'm looking for literature - documentation, best practices guides, do's and don'ts, whatever I can find to reinforce that snapshots aren't backups, that we need a separate physical entity to send backups to, and that tapes are a horrible idea. I absolutely, positively ~~do NOT~~ WILL NOT target a backup to the source, that's just asking for trouble and waiting for failure. I don't want to use tape (rather have a second dedicated SAN/NAS &amp; removeable sleds for off-site in conjunction with using our amazon S3 bucket). I need to convince him that a snapshot is NOT a backup. He won't listen to reason...

Does anyone have any good resources to help educate someone that is only knowledgable enough to be extremely dangerous and hindering of necessary upgrades?

Thanks in advance, hope someone here can help!",,False,,t5_2qh18,False,,,True,t3_jszcn,http://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/jszcn/hey_reddit_i_need_some_help_convincing_a_stubborn/,
