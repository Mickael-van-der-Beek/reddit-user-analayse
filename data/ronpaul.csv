**UPDATE 3** I am talking with the mods of the RonPaul IRC channel over at freenode. The guy is setting us up a chatroom on his server to use. I'll have more info on it when I get it. But we should have a secure room setup by Monday. Mark your calendars, friends! This thing is happening.

**UPDATE 2** May 14 is the day! If it goes well, we can try for more of these. ShibbitySparks has started another thread where you can go to pledge your participation. Although you can obviously take part in this without pledging, it will be cool to see how many people we are expecting to join in. [Go here to pledge](http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/tbsae/phone_bomb_monday_may_14th_this_is_how_we_win/)

I'll message Zak again and ask him to put it on the sidebar as a reminder. In the meantime, if anyone knows how to make an IRC chatroom, please message me!

**UPDATE** I emailed Zak and the other moderators. They are on board. We need to choose a date(s) to do this. Also, if there is anyone with the internet skillz to make an IRC chatroom would you PM me? Instead of starting a thread on the day of the phone bomb, we can all meet in a chatroom. 

Also-- just for clarification: We'd be using the official ron paul phone from home system. This whole idea is just to get us together in one place at one time to help the campaign out. It would be cool to get an IRC chat full of 15,000+ paul supporters who are all encouraging each other.

I'm proposing a tentative date of Next Monday the 14th, but obviously we are open to anything.

-----
Nobody outside of the Paul campaign thought we'd still have a shot at this point. So that right there is a victory. Be proud of yourselves for that.

However, California and Texas loom large. If Romney wins those two states outright, this whole thing is over. Done. Finished. 

The bad news? It's not looking good (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statewide_opinion_polling_for_the_Republican_Party_presidential_primaries,_2012#California_.28June_5.29).

The good news? It all is coming down to these two contests. If we can get Paul a victory there, I really think the convention goes brokered. We now have the opportunity to focus ALL OUR EFFORTS on our final stand.

Redit is pretty awesome, I we've banded together to do some amazing things in the past. Let's do it again. 

**My Idea To Win The Race**
There's 20,000 people in this subreddit. As I mentioned before, it's all coming down to CA and TX. Let's do some kind of crazy phone from home extravaganza. Everybody gets on the /r/ronpaul forum. We checkin on a certain thread, to both encourage and show each other how many are doing it. We then all start the phone from home. I'm imaging the power of having 20,000 redditors campaigning AT ONCE.

Last night opened the race up again. But if Dr. Paul doesn't win a state, and soon, it won't matter. We need to collectively do EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. THING we can do to get him to win. I'm talking about posting to Maine facebook pages,. calling Maine radio stations, buying billboards in Maine, talking to friends in maine, registering voters-- EVERYTHING. We can do this. Let's put every ounce of collective effort into getting him this state. Then we can ride that momentum. Please you guys! We can do this!

So the story starts a few months back. Louisiana just had their 2012 Republican Presidential Primary results in which Rick Santorum took 1st place, Mitt Romney in 2nd place, and Ron Paul in 3rd place. This secured that 10 delegates for Santorum and 5 delegates for Romney will be bound for them at the Republican National Convention in Tampa this August. The media with their lackluster knowledge of politics didn't mention that Louisiana has 46 delegates that will represent them in the National Convention, not 15. The other 41 state delegates will be chosen by the congressional delegates who will be voted on in the Louisiana Caucus. Not too long after, Louisiana held it's Caucus for the registered republicans to vote for congressional delegates who will go to the State GOP Convention and vote for the other other 41 state delegates. Louisiana has 6 Congressional Districts. Ron Paul won 4 of the 6 districts, Mitt Romney won 1 district, and both presidential candidates tied and had to split the congressional delegates in half in the 6th district. The media still remains silent through this huge victory for Ron Paul. Ron Paul will have 113 out of the 180 congressional delegates represent him and his (our) platform at the Louisiana GOP Convention. This means that Ron Paul essentially ""won"" Louisiana. Needless to say the establishment was not too happy about this outcome and they made plans of their own. I'm proud to say that I am one of those 118 elected congressional delegates.

This past weekend was the Louisiana GOP Convention in Shreveport, La, where us delegates had been participating in committees and other activities to change future rules, platforms, and vote for the remaining state delegates. The GOP set up a convention schedule months in advance. The committee meetings were scheduled to be on Saturday morning and the voting of state delegates in the afternoon. Two days prior to the Convention day, the GOP Head Chairman had decided to move the committee convention up to Friday morning so that the inconvenience for delegates of missing work and making lodging accommodations would result in the absence of the elected Ron Paul delegates. Their poor tactic didn't work and everyone made arrangements to be there. The Chairman decided to hand out a new rule book which would take effect immediately on the night before Saturday's convention. This was a clear violation of the LAGOP rules that state clearly that new rules would be approved by a majority. The Chairman's new rules were obviously to favor his authority and power and keep himself immune from a majority rule. This would also give him the authority to choose certain delegates instead of letting the majority (Ron Paul supporters) vote on these certain delegates. A majority of the rules committee obviously denied this arrogant request by the Chairman on Friday.

Saturday morning. The Committee Chairman passes out his new rule book as if nothing happened the day prior. When the congressional district leaders filed for a motion at the convention the Chairman didn't recognize the motion and purposely ignored all the motions as if the leaders were invisible. The crowd started getting restless from the blatant disrespect. A congressional district leader stands up and makes a motion to the audience to appoint a new GOP Committee Chairman. This is a legal action and is supported by the LAGOP rule book. When the majority voted and supported the favor of a new chairman the new chairman was then implemented. The old chairman lost control of the room and told the cops to arrest the person speaking to the convention who led the new vote. While the peaceful speaker was being arrested, the cops broke 4 of his fingers and I believe used a taser on him. The chairman said that he blacked out for an hour as he returned limping on a cane. (This arrest is caught on the video below.)

The old chairman kept resuming the convention schedule despite the fact that he was legally voted out. All of us 118 delegates (majority of the room) then stood up and turned our chairs 180 degrees to put our backs to the former GOP speaker and his podium and we resumed the convention with a new Chairman and speaker appointed who was facing us from the opposite end of the room. The new chairman had a microphone and amplifier to match the volume of the former speakers mic. The former GOP chairman then had the speaker arrested because he didn't appreciate his obvious diminished power. The cops tackled the defenseless 60 something year old handicapped speaker and during the process broke his hip. He was taken out in a stroller and later arrested while he was getting X Rays in the ER. We then had a new speaker (a female) who led us through the process of voting on the rest of the 31 delegates who will represent the state of Louisiana in the Republican National Convention while the former GOP Chairman took votes with his minority delegates of who they believe will be the 31 people to represent Louisiana in Tampa.

After the convention the cops proceeded to bully ""The Ron Paul People"" to leave the convention and not to loiter despite the fact that we paid for the use of the convention center. I have left this experience disgusted with the Republican Party and disgusted with the police who ""protect and serve"" their community. We still live in a brutal Police state where politicians and cops are above the law and will resort to physical violence against their own peaceful citizens. The establishment has broken its own rules to keep itself from a peaceful revolution that legally played and won at its own game. They've hired the police to violently restrain its own citizens and elected chairman/delegates/etc... This is a modern case of a slavery plantation's tactics to keep its slaves in line. I hope that my good work will one day pave the path for a true Republican candidate that will arise in my lifetime whether that be in Gary Johnson or whomever. For the present, there is no way I can/will ever vote for a republican for president that doesn't have the name Ron Paul. I have also found a new deep respect for non violent/peaceful protestors such as the civil rights leaders. Every bone in my body wanted to be anything but peaceful despite the police brutality I witnessed. Our president has now passed a bill that arms the FDA. What is this world coming to where we need the FDA to kick down doors with guns to prohibit the sale of unpasteurized milk from local Amish farmers? The republican party is as liberty minded and freedom loving as Joseph Stalin, Adolph Hitler, Mao Tse Tung, and all fascist government organizations that blinds its citizens facade of freedom under the blanket of nationalism.

When i watch the nomination of Mitt Romney all I will think of is the famous quote from Star Wars when Padame says ""So this is how liberty will die, with a thunderous applause""

Here is a video of part of what happened today...

Whether anyone thinks it or not.,Froobarz,730,214,250,http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/tpvdp/everyone_keep_your_strategies_and_plans_paul_is/,"First and foremost, calm the hell down. If you guys don't stop acting as little girls with wet underwear, it'll tear everything we've done apart. Ron Paul has NOT conceded any campaign and he has not removed himself from ANYTHING. It's time to realize IT'S GO TIME.


Listen up, We know for a 100% fact, Paul is wanting presidency, and we are going to give it to him. I don't care what he sounds like in interviews, I don't care why he doesn't outright attack Romney, but we're taking the nomination from Romney and we're beating Obama.


All of these dimwits on the GOP are going to be removed and we're taking back our party. The recent announcements by Benton and Paul himself ARE NOT FOR YOU. Paul is playing CHESS and not checkers like the rest of the GOP (a comment I read here).

Remember, Liberty does not sleep and freedom costs effort and blood. It is time to revive the American blood that is in you. It is time to realize how many people have fought and died for our ability to live freely. 

Dr.Paul has relentlessly fought congress and all others for over 40 years, we must continue this fight for two fold that! He's taking this nomination because every last damn one of you are going to get out there and start campaigning, talk to your friends, neighbors, cousins, family, church members, cult members, what ever. IT IS GO TIME LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

The MSM and others think he's out, as others have said before, now is the time to enforce everything we've ever done before even more so. Dr.Paul said himself, he will not drop out until the results of the RNC in Tampa.

Another great comment I read here is, Ron Paul was drafted for this cause, we all are. The constitution commands us to stand up for ourselves and against tyranny. Do you want to live under a king? Or do you want to live as free Americans. This is why America is so amazing, the original idea behind everything! Liberty! 


We must not allow these corporations and their money to control OUR lives. It's time to wake up and take back our dollar, take back our privacy, take back our futures. Our generations past have made mistakes with our current elected officials, but if we do not correct it, WE WILL PAY FOR IT WITH ENSLAVEMENT. I am a free man, not a slave to anyone, it is time we pay off our debts and remember where our foundations come from.


What happened with the revolution that started America? They left their families and warm houses with food to fight for their rights. It is time we realize we cannot be warm and well fed with the issues at hand. Turn off your damnable television and start educating yourself and everyone around you about the issues and the consequence.


You and I both know that if Ron Paul does not win this nomination, it will be a very hard and sore punch to the gut. SO LETS FIGHT BACK AND TAKE IT ON THE FIRST VOTE AT TAMPA.


Take every damn negative comment and article you've read on reddit and throw it out of your mind. We're winning this fucking nomination and you can't deny it. We have raised millions of dollars for liberty, we cannot let that go in vain, we will not let it go in vain. If Paul does not win the nomination, our dollar WILL collapse and it will cause more consequences than anyone else can know. Your hard work in school / college and every day jobs will be worthless if we cannot keep our country alive and the USD real. 


People speak of Paul causing a movement, yes that is true, the movement from congressman to President. THIS IS OUR TIME FOR OUR VOICE TO BE HEARD. 

It is time for each and everyone of us to realize, yes it may be exhausting to say the same things over and over, but realize what Dr.Paul has had to put up with for the past 40 years. Imagine thinking to yourself about all the people who shun you and ignore you, call you insane and old. Dr.Paul is NONE of those. We should not give a damn about any of these name calling people, we know they're scared of anything that isn't ""OKAY'D"" by their mommies and daddies, and foremost their government to keep them safe.


Now Listen folks, Get out there, keep fighting, don't stop, liberty does not sleep and we know tyranny is lurking in the shadow of our doorpost. 

Ron Paul has never dropped out, he has never quit; he will win this nomination and the presidential election and it will be because of everyone reading this. We have men and women overseas in war with other men and women who do not want to fight but are forced to because of our horrid international policy. 

A vote for anyone but Ron Paul is a vote for murder. There is no reason for any war, any drone bombing or any more funding of the industrial military complex. We must realize this, we have blood on our hands and it's innocent blood.

Ladies and Gentlemen of the USA, and to those watching us from outside. this is the time, there is no better time than now. Get out there and start convicting and converting people to the everlasting idea of Liberty. 


EDIT: A majority of the nay-sayers have replied already and I have one thing to say to you, We have many and will have more delegates. Thank you.

Mitt Romney just received more than 2,000 votes from the delegates, well more than the 1,144 votes needed to secure the nomination.  As a Ron Paul campaign volunteer in three states, Colorado, Washington and South Dakota, it is incredibly disappointing.  But I have moved on and have made what I believe is the correct decision, voting for the Libertarian nominee for President, Gov. Gary Johnson.

I certainly understand the reasons many have for considering writing in Ron  Paul, and the ""No One But Paul"" attitude.  Many of us have volunteered countless hours and contributed many dollars into the Ron Paul campaign, and would like to see it through all the way to November.  But I see today as the official beginning of the Gary Johnson campaign.

We need our dissent to be unified and quantified.  Countless states do not accept write-in candidates, while the rest only lump them all together.  For our movement to have the greatest impact we need to rally around one candidate.  Gary Johnson should be that candidate because of his commitment to our civil liberties, sound money and immediately ending the drug war and the war in Afghanistan.  To show the true strength of our movement we must vote, and all vote for the same candidate.  It goes without saying that having Gary Johnson in the debates is good for the future of our country.

We have to live in reality, and that reality is Ron Paul will not be on the ballot in November.  Gary Johnson will be on the ballot in all 50 states.  The Republican party has consistently shown we are not welcome in their party.  If that is their attitude, we must take our vote elsewhere.  We must also reach out to anti-war democrats also committed to ending the war on drugs and protecting civil liberties.  We must show them Gary Johnson is the only candidate who is committed to these issues.  We must take equal votes from Republicans and Democrats in order to show the country how important these issues are to us.  Our movement is much bigger than one man, as Ron Paul has said, and it is much bigger than this election.  We must give the country an accurate count of our numbers, and the best and most effective way to do this is to vote for Gary Johnson in November.  The ""No One But Paul"" sentiment needs to end if we are to keep our movement in the mainstream.  Let's show the country we are not a cult, let's show them we are committed to the ideas of liberty.  Please vote for Gary Johnson in November and do whatever else you can to promote the ideas of liberty.

(Keep it pithy and completely ""non-crazy."")

Here's how you can (two ways):

THE HONEST WAY (20-40 seconds total): 
1. Call your local TV stations all over the nation. (3-5 in each city.)
2. Ask for the ""assignment manager,"" ""10/11pm producer"" or managing editor (do not ask for a reporter!)

4. Tell them (cheerfully and briefly) that you'll be watching them tonight, and thank them for their time.

THE SLIGHTLY DISHONEST WAY (30-90 seconds total):
1. Call your local TV stations all over the nation. (3-5 in each city.)
2. ""Assignment Editors"" will answer the phones. Ask for the ""Assignment Manager,"" ""Managing editor,"" or ""10PM producer.""
3. When asked what it's regarding, say ""This is (your full name) calling back about the primary tonight.""
4. When they answer, tell them ""I interviewed with (pick a reporter's first name) last week, and I wanted to call and make sure you'd be (a) profiling the candidates tonight and (b) giving them all a fair shake ... especially Ron Paul.
5. Thank them for their time and remind them cheerfully you'll be watching THEIR coverage tonight, not any of their competitors.""",,False,self,t5_2qh0r,False,,,True,t3_oq158,http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/oq158/i_ama_mainstream_tv_news_producer_calling_for/,

In 2008, Paul dominated the 18-25 year olds.  Today, its the 18-29 year olds.  And then whomever the torchbearer is in 2016 and 2020 (Rand?  Gary Johnson?) will have the 18-33 and 18-37 year olds respectively.  

Paul's not out of touch with the party, the party's out of touch with the base.

Even if they do recognize the shift and they're just reluctant to give up the gravy train, they'd still be better served in the long run to just accept the change now as opposed to waiting and losing more in the future.


Edit 1:  Okay guys, some of you weren't picking up on the joke, so here goes:  During an interview, Jack and Suzy Welch claimed that they were Mitt Romney supporters, but that all 4 of their sons were ardent Ron Paul followers.  4 out of 6 is 67%; it wasn't an actual poll.

RonPaul Supporter Brent Tweed wins chairman....by 4 nail-biting votes. 1118-1114 votes
 
* Up next: Luncheon.

* After lunch, there is a motion to suspend the vote....check the credentials of delegates....and also do a hand written ballot....

* This is going to go on and on...

* 2208 total voted for the Secretary and 2232 total voted for the chair.
Somehow more Robme people slipped in and they STILL couldn't win and now they want a credentials check.

* Paper ballot and suspend rules didn't get 2/3. Looks like Brent Tweed got chair and is sitting on stage waiting.

* They just announced each counties delegates numbers vs actual delegates signed in. Now they are asking to meet with each of the County chairmen in private with their total county delegates

* Webster has asked Tweed to take up his position as chair...and so it begins.

* Nope. Convention is on pause because the Romney folks are challenging the chairman vote

* voting to take place on Sunday at 9:30 due to confusion over fake delegate slates.

* I won't be updating this post further as I'm off.

* If you want to read what Maine GOP members are saying about the convention, read [this thread](http://www.asmainegoes.com/content/maine-republican-convention-chairman-be-contested?page=3#comment-634800). I've linked to someone on team Romney who is giving their 'other side' of the story.

Please hear me out.",anonymouAngryLiberal,431,118,104,http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/npnp4/35yo_lifelong_liberal_highly_educated_minority/,"I was disgusted to see what Fox did to Obama and I am disgusted by this as well. But I hope that you guys do not get disheartened and remember that our current President faced similar smears. Now Dr. Paul faces anger from both sides as opposed to only Fox so this will be more difficult but still very possible if executed well. 

By saying that Ron Paul is racist, these people are scaring people like me into believing that he's being dishonest about his positions on the war on drugs &amp; iraq &amp; islamaphobia  just to win younger voters. I genuinely believe an honest dialog from Dr. Paul would work for them. Hearing Obama talk like an adult about race comforted white voters, and Americans are still concerned enough that we have to believe they will at least listen. 

All it would take is a well produced message giving Ron Paul the camera 3-5 minutes to talk about Race. It doesn't have to be on tv - the internet will spread it.  Clearly he cannot get this out in a way liberals will believe it on MSNBC or CNN or TPM (who disgustingly and dishonestly tweeted ""fear of a black planet"" as a ron paul song, not realizing that these people are throwing around the word ""racist"" as if it means nothing does more harm to minorities in the long run ) 

I'm not a writer but I'd imagint it along the lines of something like this:

-------------------
I am here to apologize for my past affiliations. I have disavowed them numerous times but I  know that is not enough. 


I hope that at the very least you can hear me out as to why I believe a Libertarian belief is a panacea rather than a burden on the racial problems that plague this country. I believe that even admitting we have problems with race in this country is in itself more honest than my fellow candidates.


Because of the the ""war on drugs,""  we imprison minority populations for non-violent drug offenses at a disturbingly higher rate than we do for others. One does not have to be member of a specific community to be disturbed by this. 

(also talk about wars, maybe food prices as a result of bad monetary/regulatory policy. the policy will be easy)

I hope at the very least you will consider that unlike anyone else you've seen running I have said and believed the same thing for 30 years and I have a public record to reflect that. I ask you, America, to at least consider my words instead of the divisive &amp; distracting media which I would suggest is part very reason we find ourselves here where we are. My associations were shameful and I have apologized numerously and will do so as much as I need to but I hope that we can move past these disgusting words from decades ago to discuss America here and now.

And lastly I humbly ask America that the Libertarians and real Conservatives and Constitutionalists in America not be burdened with this criticism because of my past mistakes in choosing friends. This is a vibrant and concerned group of people who have sparked more political movement on the ground in the last 40 years during a time when the country needed it most. Whatever happens, I thank my supporters for believing in me and more importantly, believing in Liberty. 

I know full that defending oneself' against accusations of racism is an uphill battle in America, and I thank you for hearing me out. 

God Bless America &amp; Merry Christmas,

( bring tiny tim out with the corpse of checkers the dog (which signifies the death of the neo-cons) but maybe we don't need the dead dog, queue the patriotic music)

edit: i'm also a longtime reddit user (since 2007) with a comment karma in the hundreds if not higher posting anonymously. i have argued against libertarians in the past and am happy to share my account with anyone that wants to PM me. something like this would win me and surprise my liberal minority friends -- i know that much. 

edit2: thank you guys for the upvotes and for even reading my thoughts. i have been feeling uneasy and frankly helpless and without a voice in this crossfire of unreasonable accusations and i appreciate and am heartened by this civil a conversation with those with who i have genuinely disagreed with for so long. you guys are awesome. many of us look forward to the progressive vs. libertarian debate that America deserves. i'm signing off now to go program a bit for work but i wanted to thank you again -- i love not seeing a single comment below zero points. 

edit3: i'm getting on a plane now to go visit my folks but you guys have changed my mind on a few things in terms of how necessary I think something like this is.

But the numbers mean nothing if nobody actually VOTES and GETS OUT THE VOTE.

The front page is filled with karma whoring pictures of/with Paul, Facebook arguments, memes, subreddit drama, polls, videos of rallies, media bias, GOP candidate quotes, election fraud, etc. That's all fun and interesting to share, but at the end of the day, it does nothing to organize our large numbers to turn them into VOTES - which is most important. The only vital information I can see is in the sidebar, which is not always up to date.

There is an arguably number of us here whose activism amounts to nothing but sporting bumper stickers and arguing with indifferent strangers on the internet. 

**The circle jerk needs to end. Wipe off your chest and let's get to work.**

We should have threads posted for each state, sharing locations and exchange contact info via PMs to get together and organize get-togethers. I know there is meetup.com, but even here in the Los Angeles area, the closest one many miles away from my city, and I'm certain there are more supporters close by.

The most upvoted posts should be ones that describe our individual strategies and alert us of local events. 

There are people who come here to ask questions about Paul's positions. This is completely welcome, but the same stuff is being asked over and over. The sidebar should include threads that answer these questions so we can refer them over and move on. 

Ron Paul has been working most of his life for you guys, it's only fair that we work twice as hard to help him.

Maybe, maybe not. That is really up to you. We have been calling, emailing, and knocking on doors for over a week now trying to collect signatures for Dr. Paul and his delegates in the 8th congressional district. To date, unfortunately, the response has been underwhelming. Our signing events are netting on average 12 signatures.

**As of 2/4/2012, the 8th congressional district is about 2800 signatures short of our goal, and the deadline is fast approaching.**

Please come and sign his petitions. It is that simple, I do not know how else to put it. You don't sign, it won't happen. The Establishment will NOT put Ron Paul on the ballot so you can vote for him at the April 24th primary. You have to put him on the ballot.

We have just two more signing events this week and then it is over. Your last chance to sign before this weekend is over is tomorrow, Sunday, February 5th from 2 - 6 pm in Warrington, Bucks County, at the Century 21 New Horizons Real Estate office at 20 Easton Road.

Load your car with every registered Republican you know from the 8th congressional district and join us. A short drive and 5 minutes of your life spent with fellow Ron Paul supporters for a chance to turn the tide of history. Here  is the link to the event: http://www.meetup.com/ronpaul-25/events/50544262/

On the front page, I don't see a single submission discussing ways we can positively impact the campaign. I see no cohesion. I see a lot of scattered support and a lot of people who agree with the ideas, but not much in the way of practical use. 

I've said it before, but we need to make a concerted effort in February to really impact Super Tuesday. I've called it an Information Bomb. 

Now, before you say say it's common sense that we should be telling people we know and we should be campaigning all the time, think about the money bombs and how crucial those have been. It's far more effective to establish a real goal and then achieve it than to say very casually, something like, ""make sure you donate some money at some point"". People forget that. They get busy. They put it off. It's too abstract, just like the approach I feel many people are probably taking toward this primary season.

We're fed up with the lack of coverage he's getting from the major networks. Why are we fed up? Why does it bother us? Not simply because we want to see ""our guy"" on television, but because we know he's not being heard by the people who need to hear him. He's not being heard by your grandparents or parents or even siblings or friends who don't frequently use the internet. There a lot of them out there. There are a lot of them who you have INSTANT access to by picking up your phone or hopping in your car. The news media has to get these people at very certain times, you can contact any of them you know whenever it comes to mind. This is what we need to do. Now.

We have a month to spread this message. All of us with March primaries need to make sure we're registered and check to see if our friends and family are registered. We can't wait. We have to have the uncomfortable conversations with our parents or grandparents who take their advice from Hannity and Limbaugh. We have to speak WITH them and not AT them the way the talking heads do. Use truth and reason to break through the shell that's been built up by media bias. 

If you pass this post up and hope for things to just work themselves out, don't bitch when we end up with more war and fewer freedoms. Please take the time to post your ideas about the [February 2012 Information Bomb](http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/ov9z6/february_2012_information_bomb/).

**GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON TO IOWA SUPPORTERS: VOTE FOR RON PAUL IN THE CAUCUSES**


December 31, 2011, Santa Fe, NM -- Former New Mexico Governor released the following statement today regarding next week’s Iowa Caucuses:

“Wednesday, December 28, I announced that I am seeking the Libertarian nomination for president. Accordingly, I urge my supporters in Iowa to vote for Dr. Ron Paul in the upcoming Iowa Presidential Caucuses.

“While Ron Paul and I are both libertarians, we don't necessarily agree on every single issue. However, on the over-riding issues of restoring our economy by cutting out-of-control spending and the need to get back to Constitutional principles in our government, Ron Paul and I are in lock-step. Indeed, I proudly endorsed Ron Paul for President in 2008.

“The cause of individual liberty and freedom is bigger and more important than any candidate or campaign. I am hopeful that in urging my supporters in Iowa to vote for Ron Paul in the upcoming Caucuses, a victory for the principles we share can be won.”",,False,self,t5_2qh0r,False,,,True,t3_nxinx,http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/nxinx/gary_johnson_urges_iowa_supporters_to_vote_for/,

I'm 18 years old, this is the first election year that I could be active in. I was first made aware of Ron Paul in 2008, while I was in eighth grade. Ever since then I have become obsessed with the political process, and more than that I have divulged myself in the liberty movement, something I feel I wouldn't have done without Ron Paul leading the way.

Dr. Paul has spent more time fighting for us than I have even been alive, and I cannot thank him enough for this.

This past March, the Youth for Ron Paul campaign invited me to Seattle to work with the campaign for a week, and I flew from Pennsylvania to take part of something that was bigger than myself. That week I met Ron Paul, from that moment on my involvement in this movement became more aggressive than ever, and I had the motivation to continue spreading this message despite all of the opposition.

All of us are upset by the events of the past few days, and there is nothing wrong with that. But we must recognize what has been done here, the groundwork has been laid down for a future generation of liberty activists who simply WILL NOT allow the injustices of today to continue. It is up to us, to continue fighting for the message of liberty. We must be the ones to run for office, we have to be the ones to never let our efforts be undermined by the establishment, we must be the ones who stand up into the face of the machine and prevail. And we will.

The events of the past few days have made certain that my future is in the government. We simply can not leave it up to anybody else to fight for liberty, we must do it for ourselves. We the people with our eyes open have a moral responsibility to not let this continue. The time is now for us to act, the future is ours.

Please, Please, do not be discouraged by the outcome of this election, it simply was not meant to be. When the time comes for us to take the reins, let us look back on the motivation we had, let us fight for liberty with the same level of enthusiasm that we had this year. This is only the beginning of a fight that we WILL win. This system has run its course, and we are going to be the ones that will be remembered for saving ourselves from oppression, we will be the ones to make a difference, make no mistake.

Thank you, Dr. Paul, for giving us something to fight for, thank you for dedicating your life to the cause of liberty. You will be the one that we all look back and remember as the one who allowed for us to take control, and stop this mess. Thank you Dr. Paul, for inspiring me to get involved with government, we will not forget this effort, and we will make you proud.",,False,self,t5_2qh0r,1337177499.0,,,True,t3_tp5fh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/tp5fh/thank_you_dr_paul/,

You're all here for a variety of reasons and whatever those reasons are, I am so glad you are here to express them.  The free exchange of ideas and opinion is the heart and soul of the country I love. What saddens me, however, is the lack of care.  When you see something that is even slightly anti-Paul, our reaction shouldn't be to immediately try to discredit them, cry fraud or, worse still, level charges of corruption and cronyism.  

I am not naive enough to believe that those things don't exist and aren't in place in the American government, legal system and economy, but we are not the victim in every exchange.  

Ron Paul's message is one of American solidarity founded on the single greatest expression of human liberty and freedom the world has ever seen, the Constitution.  Our young country has been the blueprint of nations rebuilding after war or occupation and the reason for that is the document we hold so dear. 

And part of that document is the right to free speech.  The EPS guys are allowed to have their say. Romneyites, Obamans and the Westboro Baptist Church all have the right to say what they think.  It is absolutely crucial to a free society.  

You can and SHOULD argue with reasoned logic against things you feel strongly about, but expect resistance.  What we CAN NOT allow ourselves to do is lower ourselves to ad hominem attacks and name calling. We can't let those who would call us crazy for our believes bring the very same out in us. 

Basically, what I want is for this subreddit to be a place of REAL discourse and more importantly, a place where action towards our ultimate goal is planned. 

I love a good Ron Paul meme, and I get frustrated when the media ignores Ron Paul, but complaining about it does NOTHING to help change it.

Organize, show up in force and for God's sake, VOTE and you will see the tune change.  It's easy to dismiss people who show up in the thousands to rallies but don't bother to go vote. 

Please, /r/RonPaul, don't get bogged down in the nonsense and trivialities.

It's in jeopardy of changing in favor of the establishment.,davidverner,338,74,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/tiiox/attention_alaska_is_not_a_victory_yet_the/,"A lot of people have been holding the state of Alaska as a Ron Paul victory when the fact is it is not assured yet.  Our convention was not adjourned but forced to stop until another day [video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXhJ_ZEDXmQ&amp;feature=plcp) [video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np5h7A0dNCA&amp;feature=plcp#t=37m).  The hassles and shenanigans that happened in the credentials caused turmoil for those that had to wait until the day of the floor meeting to be seated making people become more disenfranchise.  The blatant attempts by the establishment to bulldoze through issues has also left many with a sour taste in their mouth [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCx97hHkiYU&amp;feature=plcp).  

With the SEC meeting that happened on the May 7th the information I have been given [image](http://imgur.com/hQGnu) makes it seem the establishment want to prevent the SCC meeting on June 9th to become the second meeting of the convention by preventing a quorum from happening (2/3 districts present, and 50%+1 of the delegates).  Do to the unique situation Alaska is in, the majority of the delegates have to fly in to the convention to be physically present.  It was brought up in the SCC meeting fallowing the the convention [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np5h7A0dNCA&amp;feature=plcp#t=44m30s) that we could do some sort of teleconferencing or video conferencing.  Of course during the SEC meeting many argued against doing this because there are no rules **for it**.  Of course there are no rules **against it**.  

I have also heard some disturbing rumors about Paul delegate selected for national convention being blocked because there isn't enough money in their accounts for withdraw for the national convention hotel.  I haven't been able to confirm this on my own yet so I'm still classifying this as hearsay until I can get more evidence to confirm this.  

It is not known if we might need help from the greater Paul community but the people that are upset with how things are going in Alaska might ask for help before the second round happens.  I'm self employed and have set up a deal myself to offer a small portion of my income (if I make anything this month) to help people be able to attend this convention.  I'm also going to try and interview people in my local area about problems that the establishment has caused them trying to prevent them from being a delegate.  

This is a big task for me since I'm flying to Chicago next week to document the NATO summit and the protests around it.  I will post updates as more confirmed information comes forward and can I validate it.

I have also posted some videos from the floor meeting on this [youtube channel](http://www.youtube.com/user/OccupyFromTheNorth/featured).  More will be uploaded this weekend.

Rand doesn't deserve the recognition his father gets for such different views, and everytime a post here praises him, I can't help but wonder how many people are aware of the difference between the two.

I wanted you to get an update from me personally, since we have some great news!

Due to the smart planning of our campaign and the hard work and diligence of supporters like you, we stand to send nearly 200 bound delegates to the Republican National Convention in Tampa. This number shatters the predictions of the pundits and talking heads and shows the seriousness of our movement.

What's more, we will send several hundred additional supporters to Tampa who, while bound to Romney, believe in our ideas of liberty, constitutional government, and a common-sense foreign policy.

When it is all said and done, we will likely have as many as 500 supporters as delegates on the Convention floor.  That is just over 20 percent!

And while this total is not enough to win the nomination, it puts us in a tremendous position to grow our movement and shape the future of the GOP!

I hope every one of you continues the fight we have advanced so well this year.  I hope you will finish your local and state conventions, and, if you were selected as a national delegate, that you will head to Tampa in August to force the Republican Party to listen to the voice of liberty.

We have never had this kind of opportunity.  There will be hundreds of your fellow supporters in Tampa who will be ready and willing to push the Republican Party back to its limited government, liberty roots.

There are many issues to fight for in Tampa.  Also, candidates like Justin Amash, Kurt Bills, and Thomas Massie need your support as we move into the fall.  Across the country, supporters of liberty have won local office and leadership positions in the GOP, and we need to keep working.

Our delegates’ presence must be felt both in Tampa and in years to come. 

Stand up for what we believe in.  Be respectful.  And let the establishment know that we are the future of the Party and of the country.

Our Revolution is just getting started.  You'll be hearing plenty from me as we approach Tampa and the fall elections.  You'll also be hearing of important developments on Audit the Fed and Campaign for Liberty.

I hope you'll continue to stand with me as we go forward.  Our Revolution could not have come this far without you.

For Liberty,

Ron Paul

Well, when I got there, they had 2 confirmed speakers; one for Romney, and one for Santorum. I couldn't believe it, seeing as our county was fairly large.

It started off with a volunteer to speak for Gingrich. Once he finished, they took one final call for a Paul speaker. I couldn't let Paul go unrecognized and unrepresented. I stood up, and began speaking on the podium. I hardly even realized I was doing it. I just did it. My friend and I were quite possibly the youngest voters there, and I was the only one representing Paul. I was so nervous. I finished my speech, and accepted the round of applause. I had done it. 


I represented Paul well, and my speech was good considering it was Impromptu. I received many congratulations, and had my picture taken for the newspaper. I was still shaking haha. Unfortunately, my efforts could not hold off the onslaught of Santorum votes. But, I can hold my head high, and say that I did my best and stood up for Paul when no one else would.

Yes, Ron Paul has a huge support base, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. He obviously has the most fervent supporters, and they come out in droves to see him.

No, Dr. Paul will probably not win Michigan or Arizona today, but don't let that discourage you. We are still the minority within the political system, but we are growing-- and by our own work, too. We don't have help from the media; it's all hapenning based soley on the message of Dr. Paul and our ability to spread it.

Some of you will be discouraged by Santorum's numbers today in the primaries, but remember: too many Americans simply vote for someone like Santorum out of a default. They simply vote because they should, but don't truly care. So that's why his crowds are small but his voter turnout is huge.

She ended up getting a lecture on how we were falsely led into the Iraq war and how it's starting again with Iran.

She didn't know jack about NDAA/indefinite detention and who supported it and who didn't.  She did agree that anyone who supported such a bill shouldn't be in office.

She promised she would study the issues and Ron Paul.  I asked her to do so before she called anyone else.

I doubt these same supporters are necessarily better educated or more intelligent, but it wouldn't hurt to explore that as well.  The point is, if this hypothesis can be confirmed, it would go a long way to debunking the media's favorite propaganda pitch: young, uninformed potheads

the political moves that are being made to give you people a legitimate voice in the
Republican Party. 

The only way Republican hard liners will allow Ron Paul supporters to have a role 
in the upcoming National Convention is if they don't view you guys as a threat to 
their interests.

They fucked us over in 2008 at the National Convention, and they will do it again in 2012.

Rand's endorsement is just one way in which this perceived threat can be mitigated.

The GOP is salivating over this Rand Paul endorsement because it's exactly what they 
wanted this whole time. 

And if that endorsement is what it takes to get our foot in the door at the convention then so be it. Stop crying foul, and flooding this subreddit about it, if you can't see the political machinations that are going on then shut up! 

Are we so narrow minded to think we can change the direction of American politics by the end of 2012? This is a decades long war which will require political participation on all levels. And your negativity about what is going on only gives joy to our ""enemies"", and divides us further. 

So wake the hell up and realize that you people who are not privy to inside information have no idea what is really going on. 

Just because you are confused as to what's going on is no justification for all the negativity I am seeing here.

And some people here want to demand that the Ron Paul campaign explain themselves over this endorsement, and I say, why should they have to? 

His Texas GOP convention speech is more than enough proof to see the Ron is still fighting for all of us, and we should be fighting along side him. Even if we disagree with things that are going on behind the scenes that we do not understand.

If this speech is a sign of things to come, he is going to kick some ass when he speaks at the national convention. 

And to quote Paul from his Texas speech:

""These old Republicans are a thing of that past, and WE are the future!""

It appears to me that a handful of idiot neckbeards decided to make some sort of botnet or some shit to downvote EPS subs. Whoever did that, fuck you... seriously. I would call falseflag except I know that there are a few idiots here that probably actually did it. 

You realize this is the shit that makes us look crazy to EPS, right? It gives them fuel to hate us and confirms their assumption that we're all lunatics in a political cult. Shame on those neckbeards and fuck them.

That said, stop collectivizing and saying shit like ""I'm disappointed in this sub"" and the like. This sub has &gt;21,000 members, and I doubt more than 20 were involved in this bullshit. Most of EPS posters are actually decent people who just have problems with Ron Paul and his supporters, for reasons like this incident. However, as a mod at /r/R3VOLUTION, I can definitely say that EPS has it's trollls and idiots too. That doesn't mean we need to go full retard to defend ourselves. 

Having worked on Paul's campaign, and even chaired his campaign in my district, this is indicative of a larger problem within the Paul community. I can't tell you how much we get hurt by ~1% of our supporters screaming about bullshit like chemtrails, 9/11 conspiracies, etc. Ron Paul and libertarianism have legitimate, educated, and intelligent followers- something some in EPS may not want to admit. However, we get painted as idiots because some jackasses hop on the bandwagon to get attention that they fail to get elsewhere. Don't let them steal our movement. Don't *act* like they represent us. When you see nonsense like ""let's go do this to EPS trolls"" downvote that shit immediately. 


edit: People here **REALLY** need to stop saying this was a falseflag by EPS. It may have been, though like I said I don't doubt that a few idiots here actually participated in this downvote bot, but crying ""conspiracy"" without proof just further makes us look retarded outside the walls of /r/ronpaul. Unless you have proof, shut up.

He even asked speakers to wave at him so he could see and recognize them, then miraculously he can scan the crowd for 5 seconds and instantly denote that a ligitimate 2/3rds majority was voting to pass their slate.

I wanted to make sure everyone was informed on the caucus process.  If any one has any good additions I'll add them.

* [A quick guide from NPR] (http://www.npr.org/2011/12/30/144489004/confused-about-the-iowa-caucuses-heres-a-guide)

* [Here's a link to find your precinct and polling location] (http://iowagop.org/caucus/findmycaucus.php).  **Imporant edit** If you used the location finder to find your precinct it gave you a 'polling location'. That is for normal elections and is NOT your caucus location, go back to the caucus page and find your caucus location with the 'view all locations' or 'view by county' button.  Not the most user friendly site.

* The formality of your caucus experience will depend on the size of your precinct.  My precinct is fairly large and will be fairly formal.  In smaller precincts it's not unheard of to gather in someones home and drop a slip of paper with your candidates name in to a hat.

* Speaking of smaller precincts... because of RP's excellent ground game most will have a delegate to speak on his behalf, BUT this may not be true everywhere.  Anyone can step up and give a 2-5 minute speech for RP.  It's not a bad idea to have something prepared, especially if you're in a smaller precinct.  This is very important since caucus goers are a fickle bunch, they can be swayed.

* You can bring children.

* If you will be 18 by November of next year you can vote in the caucuses.

* If you are Independent or Democrat you can register Republican at the event and participate.

* I heard the RP campaign will have busses available for people who can't make the drive for whatever reason, can someone confirm?  Can't find anything about it.  That said, anyone in Precinct DAVENPORT CITY D33 who needs a lift, feel free to PM me.

Alright brothers and sisters, this is our time.  The revolution is in our hands.  Iowa does not decide who will be president, Iowa decides who WILL NOT be president.  A poor showing in Iowa will kill RP's campaign.  The recent polling sees RP slipping, but remember, some of those polls are conveniently discounting Independents and Democrats.  Also they don't take into account RP's younger following who only have cell phones.  **We got this, godspeed.**

**edit:** Interestingly, the Dem caucuses function a bit differently, but no need to get into that this year.  Also, if anyone has questions I'll do my best to find the answer.

1327148551.0,232,self.ronpaul,oq5fg,"Has Ron Paul really took over the web? It is time we organize, work, and win this election.",simplequestions1,279,47,52,http://www.reddit.com/r/ronpaul/comments/oq5fg/has_ron_paul_really_took_over_the_web_it_is_time/,"I have been visiting r/ronpaul for a short while now and have noticed something that must be addressed. We are reporting the news back to each other but aren't organizing to help this man win this election. I say we launch and all out campaign to attempt to actually make a difference. I am going to describe what I believe needs to be done and any additions or subtractions please reply!!

This is a list of problems stopping Ron  Paul from winning this election.
1. We all know that the media for whatever reasons do not want Ron Paul elected. They consistently ignore him and misrepresent his views. 

2. Many voters do not have the time or motivation to do the hours of research needed to really see what is going on in this election. They rely on what the media pounds into their head to make a decision. 

3. Ron Paul's ideas do not break down well into sound bites. It takes a bit of thinking and time to understand his positions and the overall philosophy. 

4. His continued spread across the internet is hindered by people instantly ignoring anything about Ron Paul because we as supporters have been marginalized and deemed crazy, sheeple, blind followers. 

Here is how I feel we need to run this campaign and I am calling for organization from everyone to make a difference. 

We need to very precisely make comments which can be posted in specific news articles, youtube videos, facebook pages, etc. across the web. These comments need to have the appearance of someone who is not biased and isn't pushing a candidate. Since people marginalize us we should work around that. We need to express views in such a way that can connect with people but doesn't sound like we are trying to campaign. 

As an example. 
In response to a news article about Romney
""Romney is the ceo that comes by your place of work once ever 6 months and leave a big list of things he didn't like while he was there. Then cuts your budget and calls for layoffs. No wonder his top campaign contributors are goldman  sachs, credit suisse group, and morgan stanley. Big banks like this type of guy it seems."" 

There is a little bit of education in there. A little bit of connection with people who has worked in those types of jobs. We need to do soft educating about how the fed works, how the ndaa works and mitt's support of it, the gold standard, many things that will put more support in Ron's corner. People need to understand these issues but will not straight listen to you. We have to be very clever and not in peoples face about it. 

On top of making these types of comments we need to speak more directly to closer friends and family. Ask them to have a serious conversation with you about this election and the importance of it. In these conversations we need to express the liberties that are being taken away from us. SOPA, NDAA, enemy expatriation act, patriot act. The very pressing nature of our national debt and tie it back to real life people. We seem to think that the government owes that money....but they dont' we the people owe that money. We need to get across how important these issues are. Have these sit down talks with closer friends and family and ask them to research and educate themselves. If they come to agree  about the dire situation in our nation then get them to pledge that they will educate others in the same manner you educated them. 

The match is easy to see. If a thousand of us educate and gain the support of 2  people and those people gain the support of  2 more. It goes as follows. 

1000=2000=4000=8000=16000=32000=64000=128000=256000=512000=1024000

We can get this message out but we have to work together.  Use your facebook as a launching pad for these issues. Use reddit to discuss the issues in depth and further educate ourselves and organize our push. Lets use this thread to do some basic discussion about how to move forward and make some logical decisions. On top of these soft educational hit pieces it is still obviously fine to blanket all news sites and articles with  youtube videos on Ron Paul. Anyone who watches these videos will at least see the real Ron Paul and not just what the media says.

But to the very mainstream voter we have to grab them without them having to invest a lot of time. We need sharp direct comments and attacks which sound natural and are well placed to grab peoples attention. 
Above all hold these placements to the rule of truth. Ron Paul would not support inaccurate campaign ads and neither should we.  I'm typing all of this on my netbook and sorry for any bad typos. I hope my basis makes it through the web and explains itself to you all. Now, lets discuss and take over the web!!

My supposedly-liberal cohorts are really starting to piss me off with their Ron Paul hate. Look, I don't agree with a large portion of Paul's views, but my priorities haven't changed since the Bush years. **My number one concern is that we STOP KILLING INNOCENT CIVILIANS AND CHILDREN around the world. No more imperialism, no more policing the world.** It's really that simple for me. I wish I could say the same for my friends, but it seems protecting social programs for any and all cuts is more important to them.

Now don't get me wrong. I'm a liberal dammit, so social programs, consumer/labor protections, egalitarian programs, regulation, etc. are all very important to me. However, I just can't rationalize letting more and more people be murdered by my country in order to make sure social programs go untouched.

I don't know what the hell happened to the priorities of my fellow liberals. In the Bush years, we rightly made opposing these illegal and useless wars our #1 priority. All of sudden, Obama comes in, amplifies the Bush policies while throwing in some progressive rhetoric, and we no longer seem to care? WTF!? It makes me ashamed to point that out, but it's the dirty truth. Apparently it's okay to drop cluster bombs on children, just as long as you talk about raising taxes on the rich.

Getting back to the Ron Paul hate... Liberals will rightly point out that Obama has been ineffective in many regards due to Republican opposition in congress and so forth. Now, why do we all of a sudden think that Ron Paul, if elected, could come in and be a dictator? We seem to think he'd magically have the power to abolish medicare, medicaid, social security, the EPA, the Department of Education, etc. We really don't seem to understand the checks and balances of our system, or that the ONE THING the President really has power over is foreign policy. Chances are Paul couldn't accomplish any of his other goals, but he could dramatically alter our foreign policy for the better.

In closing, I have registered as a Republican (I feel extremely dirty, BTW) in order to help Paul get the GOP nomination. I can't even 100% guarantee that I'll vote for him if he got the nomination, but at the very least he could put some serious pressure on Obama and bring national focus to our foreign policy.

1. Can you explain the Constitutional position on the way in which Osama Bin Laden was killed by the U.S. military within Pakistan?

2. I know you believe the 14th Amendment extends the Bill of Rights to the states. Can you explain how this is so? (I think this would be a good thing, but I just don't see it specifically in the language)

3. In an interview after the Republican debate, Mitt Romney suggested he didn't know how we could pay for a strong military if the income tax were lowered to 0% as Ron Paul suggested. What is your response to this?

4. Milton Friedman held the position that medical licensing by the government was unnecessary and harmful. Do you share this position? Why/why not?

5. If there were two books (not written by you) you could suggest to somebody who is skeptical to the libertarian philosophy to read what would they be?

EDIT: That is not all. If we can show the establishment that we are agile, if we can show the marketplace of political leadership that we really are concerned with an idea, liberty, and not completely taken with devotion to a man or a personality, then the establishment will never be able to put us down long-term. We will always be relevant. Leaders will rise from among us to prove themselves to us and ask us for our trust. We will take more and more ground. So lets stop fucking whining. I see so many whiners about Rand and Benton. So many little shitheads who were never enlivened by the IDEA of freedom, who are becoming apathetic again because Grandpa Paul is almost done. Dig deeper.

[The immediate goal that can have a tremendous effect, is getting Gary Johnson into the debates. I dont care if he can't win. If he can get there, in spite of his faults, he'll be the single most effective person to spread the ideas of liberty to millions and millions of people. He'll be on the national stage. He'll force Obama and Romney to argue against liberty. He'll force the talking heads to deal with liberty. And then he'll lose. But we'll have grown the movement. And then we'll find others running for office who love freedom and others and we'll keep going. And then 2016 will come.

We can debate about the value of a tool like Twitter later, but for now, if you aren't doing anything, please help out, because we need to make sure that everyone knows that Ron Paul is still in it. Whether you believe he can obtain the nomination or not, the value of having more and more people see his name, and possibly hear his message, could be astronomical.

Do everything you can to help! Spread the word to your friends on Twitter, ask your Facebook friends to help out the cause, and ask your family and friends.
