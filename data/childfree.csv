I've been lurking for sometime, so, first a little introduction.  I am an almost 23yo female; currently, I am working on my PhD in neuroscience.  I intend to spend the rest of my career working in infectious disease (the more dangerous, the better!).  I have a good relationship with a man older than I, but of the same mindset.  I hate kids.  All of them.  The idea of ruining my life and career for some snot-nosed shit pisses me off.  I have been like this since I was 15.

Recently, I returned to my parent's home for my little brother's high school graduation.  It was a big deal that I came back to see it (I currently live 1500 miles away in a big city, they're still Oklahoma, ugh).  At his afterparty, a gathering of hens occurred in the kitchen and my mom thought it was a perfect time to bemoan the fact that I haven't married and produced children for her yet.  I just smiled and said ""Not happening, sorry mum.""

To which the hens had a fit.  ""Your biological clock will kick in.""  ""You'll love them once you've had them.""  All the typical bull.  I kindly reminded them that due to cervical cancer that I was diagnosed with in 2009, I am missing a good portion of my cervix and it is unsafe for me to realistically carry a child without being bedridden.  (Not to mention I had just gotten a phonecall from my OB stating it was back, but that's another story...)  Finally, after being mentally abused with the whole ""you're going to ruin your mom's life"" hogwash, I finally mentioned that my SO is getting his tubes tied this summer.  

One had the audacity to lean over and whisper in my ear ""God always finds a way.  You'll have kids.""

I turned to her and calmly stated, ""Is that so?  Then I know how to find a clinic.""

Priceless.  They all turned pale and left it at that.  I'm just so proud.  I don't mean to intrude on anyone's religious feelings or anything, I was just so tired of being heckled that I have to have a child, regardless of what I want or what I am physically capable of doing.  Its my life, literally, that I'd be risking.  Ugh.

Anyways, love this community and I'm glad to be around now!

1373896814.0,688,self.childfree,1ic88v,The parents that work for me believe they have auto-priority on booking holiday time because the kids are off.,JamezPS,841,153,194,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1ic88v/the_parents_that_work_for_me_believe_they_have/,"For context, I'm a late 20's male who is child free and work as a convenience retail manager. Our 2 biggest demographics for potential employees are generally students of either gender and women aged 30+.   

I run a first come first serve system with booking holiday time, with some degree of flexibility. I get the same issues with the parents year after year. They try to book off a week during the summer holidays(6 week school vacation time) or half term(1 or 2 week school vacation time, not sure of the american equivalent) and one of two things happen. Either one of the other mothers beats them to it and asks for the same week off, so I say no, or one of the students has beat them too it, so again I say no. The differing reactions from the 2 scenarios is what drives me crazy.  

If I say no because another mum is off, that's seen as a *fair reason* and the issue is usually dropped. If it is due to a child free person being off, the reaction is literally **always** the same: ""Well they haven't got any kids, why can't you say no to them?"" A simple ""They booked it first."" is apparently, no longer a valid reason for denying them their school holidays and of course, is more often than not replied to with ""That's not fair."" Breaking News: You're an adult! You don't get school holidays and LIFE IS NOT FAIR!""  

I recently had my deputy try to argue that because she wanted the same week off as me (shockingly, I said no) that she ""shouldn't be punished just because she has parental responsibilities"" and of course ""It's just not fair"". I then asked her if it was fair that I get punished because I've kept my dick where it belongs for almost 30 years (I'm paraphrasing)  and as a result don't have parental responsibilities?  

I feel I should mention, I do have some wonderful parent employees who book all their holiday as soon as they get the term timetable and if they are flat out unable to work, will instead be flexible with their hours for the week. Sadly, these are the (much appreciated) minority.  

**TL:DR The parents at my job think they should get given priority over non-parents when booking time off, to the point that they feel persecuted if I deny their requests.**

_____________

I spent 8 years in a relationship with a guy who I thought was perfect for me. We had the same likes, dislikes, hobbies, interests. Early on in the relationship (I was 16 when we started dating) he confessed that he eventually wanted 4 children. I confessed that I wanted none. Being young, we thought nothing of the disparity.

When we got older and realized that this was a long-term relationship, we had a conversation about the future and what impact the baby-issue could have on us when we're ready to get married. He conceded. He told me that I was more important to him than his desire to procreate. We agreed on a CF life together.

And we were so happy. We got engaged. He bought a house and I moved in with him. 

When I was 23, I casually let him know one day that I was going to be switching to an IUD birth control that would last 5 years. I was so sure we were on the same page, that I even joked about it, *""It's great, because even if the .001% chance that it fails happens... The removal of the device will probably dislodge the egg and cause an abortion anyway. So, it's like birth control that comes with a free abortion if you're dissatisfied!""*

That's the conversation that ultimately ended our relationship. He confessed that he's always wanted kids, that he just conceded because he knew my biological clock would kick in when I got a little older. Or that maybe we would 'get lucky' and my birth control would fail at some point. He thought I should stay on a less long-term BC so that *when* my body started tell me to make babies, we could hurry up and pop one out. Or 4.

We tried to hold the relationship together over the next year, but it was done. I got the IUD. He spent months shaming me for having a 'broken' biological clock. He tried to bargain with me, ""Just have one. You'll see how much you like it."" He talked about it like we were test-driving a fucking car.

The worst part of it all, I think, is that my mother sided with him. She wanted grandchildren. 

I have spent the last (single) year feeling broken. Being shamed by my mother for letting 'such a catch' get away. Being scolded for her lack of grandchildren. Being mocked by my family and jokingly called 'cat lady'. Most of our mutual friends sided with him because I was responsible for ending the relationship. It sounds melodramatic to write this, but I've gone from being a confident, happy person... To seeing therapists, psychiatrists, and being put on antidepressants. I've never felt so worthless. I've withdrawn from my family because of their attitudes, I don't feel like I have any friends left. I struggle to get out of bed every morning. Sometimes I just don't.


**tl;dr He spent 8 years dating me because he was waiting for my biological clock to kick in; so that I could be his baby factory.** 


I found this subreddit yesterday. I've spent hours reading hundreds of your posts. It's been more therapeutic for me than the countless hours I've spent paying professionals to tell me that there's nothing wrong with me. It's really a big deal to me that this exists.

I don't post much, but I'll be here reading every day. Thank you guys.

Because we provide service 18 hours a day, it is shift work, but it's relatively flexible in that they will try to accommodate you where possible rather than a ""you get what you're given"" approach that I have dealt with before.

We recently had work force management come down to the office to discuss our shifts for the next 3 months. After we'd all submitted our preferences for the upcoming shifts, ""the mother"" (You know who I mean, there's always one) piped in.

""When you allocate the shifts, do you take into account staff with Parental Responsibilities""

I'm sitting there thinking oh, here we go, this is how I get stuck with my 8th shift preference, but I'll never forget what the boss said.

""I understand the situation you're in, and I'm a father of 3 myself, but we can't make special provisions as it would be unfair to our other staff who have chosen to not have children"" (He actually said chosen, as in, we'd made a choice)

It's nice to see some proper recognition and to not be discriminated against, particularly by someone who has not made the same decision.

I was telling her about my cats. One of them peed in my sink last week! I told her about how another is learning tricks. He'll sit like a dog about 15% of the time I ask. I was regaling her with all the amazing things they do and asked her when she was going to get a cat. She's got a pet friendly apartment and a cute boyfriend who would look even cuter with a cat in her lap.

""We don't want a cat."" 

What!?! 

I replied, ""There are hundreds of thousands of homeless cats in this world. They get killed in shelters, hit by cars, don't get medical attention, never have a taste of Friskies. It is so selfish not to bring one into your home.""

""We've decided that cats don't fit in with our lifestyle."" She was staring at her Mocha Chai Latte no sugar, no whipped cream, extra dry, with half skim, half full milk.

You know.. I told her she'll change her mind. It's just a stage she is going through. She expressed doubt about the cat peeing all over her apartment and the cleanup fee, but I told her it's different when it's your cat. They pee, sure, but then they meow cutely and snuggle next to you as you sleep. It's worth the headache.

You can't know love until you have a cat, until your cat lies next to your head when you are sick, obviously worried about your health. Your cat waits patiently somewhere deep asleep in your house for your return from work, welcoming you with a half open eye and a yawn. It's the best feeling in the world. There is nothing as wonderful!

I worry about her. She's no spring chicken. And who will keep her company when she gets older? DAE have friends like her? How did you convince them to get a cat? Is it ok if I just get her a cat as a gift and leave it on her front porch? I know she'll love it once she sees its adorable face!

PS. CF does stand for Cat Fetish, right?

I just chuckled and told her she needed to stop projecting her own insecurities on me.

The entire car went silent when she gasped and the subject was immediately dropped and changed.

So , maybe this is a bit circlejerky, but fuck it. That was literally the first time I have successfully shut her up about the subject of me and babies and the first time she has had absolutely nothing to say in return, and I just wanted to share with people who understand.

I'm not quite sure what I said next but I ranted at them for 10 or so minutes and then said ""I'm going to have to tell Daniel we had this conversation.""


My friends *flipped out* at me. I'm pretty sure I won't see any of them again. Apparently accidentally getting pregnant is the secret right of women, and how dare I let the poor guy in on it.


Ugh. I called Daniel, told him what was up. He says for now he is buying is own condoms and keeping them in his sight our locked up at all times.

It's what I call The Fallacy Of Parenthood.  At one point, when I was still a breeder, (late stage breeder, like 40ish) I got myself knocked up.  Yes, I was on birth control, (no doctor would tie my tubes because, even at that age, ""I might change my mind"") but I'd always had fluctuating cycles, so by the time I realized I was pregnant and had enough money for an abortion, it was too late to obtain one in, at that time, my state of residence.  Fuck me, right?  Because I was an unwed mother in a ""right to work"" state, once I started to 'show,' I was fired.  (yes, that does still happen)  And who's going to hire a pregnant woman - don't bother guessing the obvious, it's NOBODY.   Making the best of a bad situation, I opted to have the baby put up for adoption.  Since I had time on my hands, I was very thorough, and choose a lovely, educated, well off couple - on the opposite coast.  Long story short, the day of the birth arrived, but because of distance, they didn't get into town to attend the birth.  Because I am a curious female, yes, I did hold the babe until they got there, and I realized a poignant fact:  NO, once I held the child, I did NOT feel any different, ""just because it was my own.""  When they came into my hospital room later, I could sense their trepidation that perhaps I'd changed my mind about giving him up, so I welcomed them with a huge ""Thank god you're here!  Momma, Daddy, meet your son!"" Please don't anybody commend me on ""my brave choice,"" as it wasn't anything I would have chosen to endure.  I lost my home, my career and my credit will never recover.  That's a nasty little tidbit the Pro-lifers ignore. 

TL;DR :  If you know in your heart of hearts babies aren't for you, even holding your own 
won't change that.  

DAMN!  I never expected all these comments &amp; votes.  I'm touched that I was able to put forward the idea that being a woman who does not wish to have children doesn't make you some unnatural freak.  We are all of us unique!  Now, if I can only convince y'all that that number on the scale only relates to your relation to gravity, and not whether you're a good human, well, that'd be awesome.

I met my girlfriend through other friends and before we started dating we use to chat a lot about anything and everything. Every now and then the subject of children would come up, as both our mothers worked in childcare. We talked about how neither of us wanted kids and how great life would be traveling and enjoying our own money, without having to worry about another person. 

So one thing lead to another and we eventually got together. The last two years have been a blast but about two months ago she started talking about what our kid would look like. I thought it was just curiosity but one night I asked her out straight if she changed her mind. She did. We talked a lot about it but I still felt the same as I always have. I began to feel guilty about holding her back if she wanted kids. At one stage I nearly convinced myself to just do it. It would make her happy and my parents. 

Eventually I came to my senses and told her no. We had a massive argument and I ended the relationship. It is shit as I still love her but I can't have a kid I don't want. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Just need someone to talk to. /rant,alostmommy,631,83,148,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1jxjrw/rejected_from_rparenting_just_need_someone_to/,"So I'll start this off with I'm a parent. I never thought I would be and was in my 30s before it happened, and I'll be honest, it happened because I fell for all the peer pressure. The first time we had unprotected sex I got pregnant.

Now, don't get me wrong. I do love my kid. Immensely.

But I don't love being a mom.

I was once an art directer of a gallery and PT dancer at an amazing nightlcub (not stripper), out all the time, lovely dinners and wrote for our city's entertainment rag. My partner and I both traveled extensively for work, slept until noon and had lots of sex. 

Now I'm home all day playing with Lego and dealing with temper tantrums. I haven't had a dinner out (and let's be honest, I don't consider 2-3 hours of sitter time ""out"") and haven't left the country since 2011. Sex sucks. All my friends are out, and my new mommy friends only want to talk about diaper rash, solid foods and funny shit their kids say.

I don't 'regret' being a parent, but I also miss and crave and yearn for my old life. I never thought I'd miss it this much.

So, TD:DR: Don't let anyone tell you that you need to have kids to be happy. I was absolutely fulfilled before having them, and not everyone is a natural mother who falls in love with motherhood the second it happens.

I was there to see the panel for Game of Thrones with actors Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey. Their panels are usually 45 minutes long of Q&amp;As.

For the first 35 minutes of their panel, some woman a few rows above us had a small kid that just wouldn’t stop whining, crying and yelling. The arena holds about 5,000 people, there must’ve been 300 people in the nearby baby-screaming radius that were getting positively annoyed.

At some point it got so loud that even Lena Headey (who was on stage answering questions from fans) asked *“Is someone having a baby up there or something?”* You would think that after the actress herself made a comment on your annoying baby, you would’ve taken a hint and GTFO quietly.

NOPE.

The woman with the infant stayed for another good 15 minutes (baby still screaming bloody murder) until Lena, from the stage, said again *“Seriously, is that a baby being born? Do you want me to take him for you? Maybe I should”*

The whole arena cheered and clapped and the woman walked out to the nearest exit but didn’t actually leave. Then a few minutes later more babies started crying around and these women left the place, maybe out of fear of reprimand.

The panel was, decidedly, not kid friendly but there were areas designated for kids in an adjacent building where parents and kids could have their space so it wasn’t like there was no other choice.

I don’t understand why you would rather annoy everyone else around you than miss something because you couldn’t leave your baby with someone else. It’s like people who bring crying babies to adult movies and they get offended if you ask them to leave.

You have the right to be there but you don’t have the right to ruin it for everyone else. If you can’t control your baby, don’t come to these shows.

**TL;DR - Mother with a baby screaming bloody murder for 35 min didn’t want to leave an adult panel of Game of Thrones until actress, Lena Headey, called her on the annoying whining of her child.**

She once told my dad, in front of me, that because I'm agnostic I shouldn't be allowed to eat with the family for Christmas dinner. My dad is trying to make everything go right with her, so he doesn't defend me when she says those types of things. 

An important thing to note is that she herself doesn't have kids because she's unable to have them. I still don't think that excuses her comment, though.

So, we're at dinner, and someone mentions a girl from their church (who happens to be a nanny) that doesn't want to have kids. My dad's girlfriend says ""Then why is she a nanny? If she hates kids she shouldn't be a nanny."" I casually tell her that I enjoy kids, and I want to teach English, but I'm not interested in having any kids of my own. It's not that uncommon. She turns on me with fire in her eyes and says fiercely ""You don't want to have kids? How can you call yourself a woman? You're a disgrace to all women. You're only twenty, so I hope you wise up while you still can."" 

She tends to be very blunt when she says things, but that was just... insane. Who the fuck just says things like that? There's a beat of silence and I look at my dad, who is looking with sort of a tense half-smirk at his girlfriend. Then he breaks the silence by changing the subject.

It makes me sad that some people view me as a disgrace because I don't want to have kids. It makes me sad that no one out of the ten people at the table felt like speaking up on my behalf.

I'm 23, a civilian. We have a three year old GS-mix rescue and two cats. Husband enjoys his goof off time, which is mostly playing BF3 and SWTOR, while I like doing volunteer work at the animal shelter.

* ""Oh wow, you don't have kids yet and you're 23? That's so old!"" (What, you're 19 and already have two and a third on the way? Good job forcing your soldier to join the military in order to support the family you two clearly weren't ready to have.)
* ""What are you going to do when your husband deploys without having kids to take care of??""
* ""I don't think I would know what to do with myself if I had that much free time on my hands."" (from an unemployed mother of one, who couldn't handle her five year old dog after she had her baby...)
* ""Oh my god, I would never allow any animals near my baby! That's so dangerous!"" (Thank you for implying that my CGC-certified dog is vicious, when your kid is the one throwing shit at it and pulling his tail and ears. Gosh, what's my dog doing? Wagging his tail and following your kids around looking happy and being gentle with them? Fuck you. Your kids are probably safer around my dog than they are with you.)

* ""You know the army will bump his paycheck up more if you have a baby right?"" (THE RAGE at this one is palpable.)
* ""You better hurry up and get pregnant or he'll leave you for someone who wants kids."" (Actually, if in some fit of insanity I decided I wanted to keep the baby, he would probably leave me.)
* ""You know birth control causes birth defects, right? And abortions. I didn't think you were that kind of person. I pray you change your path soon, you can't know how motherhood completes you until you experience it.""
* ""What, you don't have kids? Then you can't possibly understand how hard they are to control."" (Well shit, I can control my dog and he doesn't understand english!)
* ""Oh, well I'm going ahead of you in line because I have kids and you don't."" (My response: ""That's smart--teach your children that you're entitled. I bet they get everything they want, too, right? Great example you're setting. I'm going back to where I was in line now, you can wait just like everyone else. Your spawn don't entitle you to special treatment."")

My closest friend down here: ""I love having you over. It's like every time I talk to you about both of my pregnancies and you interact with my kids, I'm acting like birth control to stop you from making the life choices I should have thought through more carefully.""

I told her that I had decided not to. She didn't look shocked, or affronted. She simply asked ""Oh really, why not?"" which to me is a reasonable question. I just explained that I'm very independent and need a great deal of quiet time to myself to be content, and I felt that my personality was not a good one for raising children (because I would be unhappy and resentful, but I certainly would not be cruel to them). I also mentioned that I greatly enjoy being an aunt and spending time with my friends kids, which is perfect because it frees me from any permanent obligation.

She said, ""You know, I get caught up because I'm so happy being a mom that I just want to share that feeling with everyone and encourage them to be one too. But it makes sense that you would feel that way because children certainly require a lot of work and energy.""

You guys, she didn't tell me I would change my mind, or get haughty because I didn't gush about what little miracles children are. She respected my point of view, in the midst of being full-on mommy hormone drugged. I have gained a lot of respect for that kind little lady.

My husband died from cancer almost four years ago. We were happily child free and together for almost 8 years. 

After he died, I went into a spiral. One drunken night, a year after my husbands passing, I hooked up with a guy I barely knew and ended up pregnant. 

Second to worst thing to ever happen to me. 

But I was surrounded by my uber religious family plus the guy saw it as a chance to snag me for good. Everyone pressured me into keeping the child and I'm ashamed to say I did. 
Eventually, I gave in and decided I would try to enjoy the idea of parenting. The pregnancy went very well and so did the birth. No horror story to be had, other than well the normal process of giving birth to a 7lbs screaming gooey human....
But I never felt that connection to my child that all these parents talked about. It just never happened. 
I told the father I wanted to do adoption. I was still mentally unstable, didn't want to be with the father, and well still didn't want to be a parent. 
But of course nobody showed me any support. Instead they committed me for postpartum depression. 

You know what my therapist said? Not everyone is meant to be a parent and adoption was probably best for me and the child. 

The father was against it completely. I lost my mother and my sisters in the process because they suddenly saw me as a horrible person. Nevermind the fact my mom was a drug addict whom I was supporting because she couldn't support me or my sisters.....but yeah I'm the shitty person for recognizing I wasn't the best for my child. 

I ended up running. I signed over custody to the father and just left. Changed my name and deleted myself from the Internet world. Just off the grid. 

Now I am happy. I have the time and ability to deal with my grief associated with losing my husband and I can focus on fixing myself. Despite the protests by EVERYONE, including the nurse that wheeled me over to the operation, getting my tubes tied was the second best thing that came out of my pregnancy. 

My child is happy as well. The father has turned out to be a great dad, with a great family support system. I contribute child support but have no other contact with the child. 

But I have been so ashamed of my choice. A big part of my therapy was dealing with the idea of what was wrong with me that I couldn't be a mother? 

But this thread......has shown me that I'm not broken. That is completely ok to not want to kids. That I'm not alone. 

My kid is happy, cared for, safe, and growing up beautifully. And so am I. 

This thread has made me happy about my choice for the first time since I made it. So thank you. 

TL;DR Had a accidental child, gave up custody, felt like satan walking, this thread gave me hope and reassurance. 

***update***
THANK YOU all so much for all of these ridiculously kind words. Seriously I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Y'all don't realize how much you have truly helped me. I've been in therapy twice a week to deal with my issues, one being this and this has made me feel better than anything else.

I have worked as a vet tech for about 10 years. To be honest I like animals way more then people. I had an experience today that just makes me so very angry with parents..! long story coming bear with me..
 A women brings in her 2 year old beautiful and healthy male cat Charlie, he has something wrong with his eye. Its probably just a small infection, its not uncommon  As the doctor was explaining this to her, she tells us that she read on the internet that it could be something call Toxoplasmosis  Which in all fairness it could be, however its highly unlikely. The Vet begins to explain that more then likely its a scratch or an ulcer, but we can't rule out FIV, Feline leukemia, or Toxoplasmosis without blood test. The woman then ask if her two small children could get any of these diseases from the cat, which is a yes. Toxoplasmosis can cause blindness in humans, but once again, this probably isn't what is wrong with the cat.
 Also we can easily rule out all of these diseases with blood work. She says no, and decides instead to euthanize Charlie. Doesn't matter that he is a sweet friendly cat, doesn't matter that with just a few blood test with can rule out all three diseases, what matters to her is that her children not be put in harms way by a cat. So we offer to let Charlie stay at the hospital for FREE until the blood work can be run and we know there isn't any diseases or risk to the children. Nope nope, she doesn't think it's a good idea, why spend $200 on Charlie when she can just go adopt another cat who is healthy for $60 at the shelter. At this point I just want to slap this woman, she then turns to me and says ""Surely you understand my children are more important then some cat right?""
Really? REALLY....!! We have done everything we can to talk her out of killing this poor cat, and she thinks I am just going to agree with her? I don't blame her for putting her children first, I blame her for treating an animal like it freaking disposable. Don't use your children as an excuse for being a heartless, selfish bitch. Why does this cat not deserve to live? Why do you have pets if your not prepared to take care of them? There is no excuse for this kind of mentality. The sad fact is that this isn't the first or even the second time I have seen someone use their children as an excuse for such a thing, and it truly makes me hate parents sometimes.

 **Update**
To start off, Charlie is still alive. I talked with my Boss/doctor and although he didn't want to put him to sleep, he wouldn't allow me to take him the the animal shelter. More or less he was worried about the owner finding out, and having to explain to the animal shelter what had occurred.  So its was kinda back to square one, I was even thinking about taking him home. Not the best option seeing that I currently have 6 rescue dogs who aren't cat friendly. So when our afternoon appointments started I was kinda bummed because I knew Charlie didn't have much longer. Then a very nice old man came in with his golden retriever Lucy. Lucy was a 12 and fighting cancer in her spleen. She lost her fight today and was put down with her loving owner at her side. Her owner, I am going to call Mr.J, just lost his wife about 8 months ago and now his beloved Lucy. It was heartbreaking!  Then a thought occurred to me, maybe he could take Charlie? So I asked the doctor who was reluctant but still allowed me to ask Mr.J if he would like to meet Charlie and maybe adopt him.  Well Charlie and Mr. J seem to hit it off, he sat in Mr.J's lap purring. Long story short, Charlie went home with an owner who deserved and needed him. Thank you guys for all the support and offers of help. It worked out way better then I could have guessed.

I was skimming the intro on Amazon and came up with this interesting tidbit:

""Our research eventually unearthed one stunning fact. The families in the worst financial troubles are not the usual suspects. They are not the very young, tempted by the freedom of their first credit cards, they are not the elderly, trapping by failing bodies and declining savings accounts. And they are not a random assortment of Americans who lack the self control to keep their spending in check. Rather, the people who consistently rank in the worst financial trouble are **united by one surprising characteristic**. *Having a child is now the single best predictor that a woman will end up in financial collapse.*

Consider a few facts. Our study showed that married couples with children are more than twice as likely to file for bankruptcy as their childless counterparts. A divorced woman raising a youngster is nearly three times more likely to file for bankruptcy than her single friend who never had children.""

**TLDR**: Couples and single women with kids MAY not go bankrupt but according to research their chances are a lot higher than their CF counterparts. Again, no thanks.

Basically, those tickets entitled me to watch matches on smaller courts, and access to Henman Hill / Murray Mount, where you can see a big screen of what's going on in the bigger courts. 

Naturally, it being a day where Murray was playing, the hill was pretty packed when we got there, about 10 minutes before the first match (Murray was playing the 2nd). Obviously, most people had gotten there early because people knew it was going to be packed. Me and my friend got some awesome seats on some steps, where you have to sit on on side of a green line so that people can still get up and down safely. There's some security guys making sure people follow the rules, and they're fine. There's this one South African security guy who's hilarious, telling people who keep stopping on the stairs (which you can't do) that 'if [they] want a video, go on iPlayer' and such, which is awesome. 

Anyway, so the Murray match has started and obviously, Murray Mount is completely rammed. Security are turning people away and telling them to go elsewhere because there's nowhere to sit on this hill. SA security guy is now next to me. Amongst the hundreds of people who tried to sit on the stairs, blocking the way for everyone else, comes a mother with a kid who's about 5 or 6 years old. 

So, the security guy tells her that she can't sit there, just like everyone else, because there's no space. So, the woman brings her child to stand between her and the security guy, as if telling him that she can't possibly move because she has a child with her. WONDERFULLY, the security man then says, loudly: ""Don't use your child to get a seat. You have to wait, just like everyone else.""

She walks away dejected and embarrassed, and everyone around me laughs and is on the verge of clapping this security guy. It was awesome. ",,False,,t5_2qtwb,False,,,True,t3_1hnofd,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1hnofd/security_guy_calls_entitled_mother_out_on_her/,

All I am going to do is present your options and the risks involved with essure and let you make an informed decision.""

She asked me if I was married, I said no. She asked how I planned on having kids if I wasn't married. I told her kids really aren't my thing, and I'll probably never end up having them.

She immediately stopped cutting my hair, looked at me (through the mirror), and said ""I can't believe you've wasted so much of your life, and you're going to waste even more of it.""

While waiting for the salesperson to check out our two used cars for trade-in, we decided to go relax in a Mazda Miata convertible in the middle of the showroom. The Miata's one of the smallest cars out there, with barely even any room to put a purse or bag.

An older couple was also waiting in the showroom, and the elderly woman wandered over to us sitting in the Miata and said, ""But where are you going to put the baby?"" I kind of just smiled and replied, ""That's not something we have to worry about. But this sure would be a fun car to drive!"" I didn't feel like correcting her to tell her that, regardless of having a baby or not, we were actually in the process of buying a mini-SUV, and were just relaxing in the Miata.

She insisted and asked again, ""But where would you put the baby? There's no room for a baby in this car!"" Because it was an elderly woman, I bit my tongue and was about to just kind of politely tell her again that it's not something we had to worry about, when my boyfriend interjected and said ""We can staple it to the top."" 

The immediate look of horror on her face was priceless. She quickly skittered away from us and went back to her husband and was pretty clearly telling him what my boyfriend just told her, while shaking her head and shooting daggers at us from across the room. 

His response was totally unexpected and hilariously awesome, especially considering that I'm usually the snarkier one in our relationship, as well as being the one that's more adamant and vocal about being childfree.

I've been unhappy at my current job and started applying around in hopes that I could move to a better job.

So I apply to any and every job that fits my skill set and lo and behold, there is a VP position available at a company I respect and would love to work for. To my surprise, I'm a dept head, but not a VP right now, I got a call back and began an 8 WEEK long interview process where I was competing against several other candidates.

I'm happy to announce my skills and sample projects beat out every other applicant, including the woman who had 10 years more experience than me, who I was expecting to lose the job to as she was incredibly talented. You know why she didn't get it? She wasn't willing to work the full 40 hours, that could become 50 hours during big projects, so she could have time with her kids... which I mean, good for her for knowing what HER priorities are. They just didn't match the company's.

I have NO problem with the fact that she probably would have gotten this job if she could dedicate the full time required. She has a decade more experience than me... but I did have some skill sets they needed that she didn't have, so who knows.

[RANT],BendyZebra,499,72,147,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1hfelv/the_emergency_room_is_not_a_daycare_rant/,"Bit of back story; I have a genetic disease and regularly end up in the hospital for emergency treatment. This time, I dislocated my neck, resulting in fluid on the brain, a crippling headache, blurred vision and a sincere hatred of light and sound.

So I'm lying in a ward with 5 other women, trying desperately to hide from the bright lights and noise, when I hear a toddler shrieking and screaming ""Mummy"". I figured ""it's a hospital, the kid is probably hurt, I can understand that"" but nope...the wailing-banshee suddenly belts into my ward, yelling at the top of her voice and bouncing off peoples beds like Tigger on speed. 

The father comes running after her but just sits down with his wife and starts yelling ""Come here, sweetheart, Mummy wants to see you"". The brat bellows ""NO!"" grabs the table next to my bed and starts slamming it into me. I glared at the parents but they sat there going ""she likes you, isn't she cute?!"". I replied through gritted teeth ""No, she's not and I'd appreciate it if you'd stop her as she's hurting me badly"". The looks they gave me were on par with what I'd expect if I said I sympathised with Hitler. Still, they just ignored me and allowed her to carry on screaming, running off and harassing the staff and patients.

My nurse saw me almost in tears and kindly pulled the curtains around the bed. The brat then starts screaming ""where's the lady gone, I want to play with the lady"" while trying to yank the curtains open, screeching and biting when her father tried to drag her away. The parents just kept laughing and going ""awww, she's so full of energy"".

After 20 minutes I was ready to commit triple-homicide so I decided to escape, just as the child's grandparents arrived. The grandfather immediately tells the child off but is overruled by the others as she's ""just playing!"". I shoot him a grateful glance for trying, climb into my stupidly heavy powered-wheelchair and just as I'm about to leave, the brat comes running up and tries to hang from my armrest. I cannot stop my chair dead, just like that, momentum doesn't cease just because their brat is there and I accidentally ran her toes over. 

The parents went •mental• at me and I ended up in tears because I was just so ill and not in a fit state to handle that half hour of the hellchild + abusive parents. I was just about to give up and scream back at them when the stony-faced grandfather reached breaking point. He stood up, grabbed the child and hissed at her parents that ""it was YOUR fault, this is a hospital, not a daycare and you should control her. This lady is sick and doesn't need you making things worse! I'm leaving and I'm taking [Child's name] with me to discipline her the way you should have from the start. I'm clearly the only considerate one here!""

The guy then motioned for me to follow him outside where he apologised to me as well as making the girl apologise. I was so grateful that I wanted to hug him.

I can't believe that the parents thought it was okay to let her do that at all, in an Emergency Assessment ward in the hospital especially! There were seriously ill people all around, needles, heavy moving trolleys full of dangerous equipment, wheelchairs etc and in the end, the child got hurt because of their refusal to actually parent her. I have never wanted to kill anyone the way I wanted to kill those bastard parents.

Sorry for the ramble, I'm still sick and stuck on my phone but I had to get this off my chest.

TL;DR - Parents allow their child to run riot in the Emergency Ward at the hospital, find it cute that she's running around until she gets hurt by my wheelchair.

This is something that I hope will help all of our subscribers have a better experience! Now with tagging it's easier to avoid rants, memes, or anything else you prefer to not view. We try to add flair when possible, but there are a fairly high number of posts every day, and it's very time consuming trying to do each one!


**To avoid this getting buried, and being unseen again, I would very much appreciate it if anyone reading this could upvote so it can be seen by more users!**


Also on an unrelated note, I wanted to say that I'm really,really appreciating everyone taking the time to report abusive or inappropriate comments. We mods spend a lot of time going through the content here to try to keep things as civil as possible, but we do miss things, and you guys are doing a great job helping us out! 


**How to use flair:**

*After going through posting your link/text post, there are options under the text box. Almost all the way to the right, there is an option that says ""flair"". Click that, then select the appropriate option for your post from the pop-up menu. After you select an option from the pop-up menu, you can edit it to make the flair more appropriate if you feel that is necessary! That will be an option unless people start abusing the flair system.*

Both said no. I am 25 so they think I will change my mind when I am older. I have known since I was a kid that I would NEVER want children of my own. I feel like I am making a great decision but no one will help me out. After asking one doctor to do the procedure she just asked 'why don't you use birth control?' I told her about my experience with it and it is not for me. I don't like what the hormones do to my body, and my body rejected a (very painful) non-hormonal IUD that I got removed, but I had to fight to get it removed. The doctor just wanted me to go on muscle relaxers until my body got used to it. So the doctor told me she was scared for me since I was not on birth control and asked me what I would do If I got pregnant. I told her I would get an abortion. She looked disgusted, walked out, and had another doctor come talk to me. 

How can people be okay with a 16 year old girl bringing a child into this world, but when a young, or any age woman, decides motherhood is not for her and pursues a different dream in her life, she is looked down on? We need doctors to perform this surgery for women.

I think its a really good challenge since there isn't a lot of high fashion stuff for pregnant ladies and my friends who have kids have said things like ""When you're pregnant, you feel and look like shit. Dressing up just to feel pretty when you feel like a whale 99% of the time is nice.""

Anyway, one of the contestants on this show is one of those militant childfree people. The kind of childfree person that refers to every parent as a breeder and isn't shy to make their dislike of kids and parents known. My friend saw their dislike and ended up posting to Facebook about how insensitive all childfree people are. She posted something along the lines of ""Do you think your parents are stupid ""breeders"" for having you? Are you really so bitter about being barren that you think people that use their body for what god intended is so bad? Fuck you lady and all your dickhead childfree buddies. Go commiserate about how lonely you are in the gutter with the other trash of society.""

This stung pretty badly because I've been friends with her for a while and its no secret with my friends and family that the hubs and I are childfree. I messaged her on Facebook chat and asked ""Was that genuine hate or hormone rage?"" And she replied with ""Genuine! I fucking hate that bitch. I'll laugh so hard when she gets knocked up or dies alone."" To which I replied with ""You attacked all childfree people with that post though. That includes me remember?"" And she said the dreaded line: ""I didn't mean you. Anyway, you'll change your mind.""

Rage. White hot, blinding rage. I said ""No. I don't think I will. I'd rather be lumped in with that stranger from Project Runway than with you and your dismissive, rude and holier than thou attitude. Its been nice knowing you these last 8 years, hope your kids turn out more to be more tolerant than you."" And deleted her on Facebook. 

So goddamn liberating!

EDIT: I've seen a few comments saying ""It's an 8 year friendship, can't you try to salvage it?"" but I left a lot out because it doesn't directly relate to childfree. This was just the straw that broke the camel's back. She's screwed over mutual friends, opinionated on things that have little to no impact on her every day life (not only childfree but also gay rights and abortion) and she's just been increasingly frustrating in general. The biggest irk of late has been complaining that she has it so hard as a stay at home pregnant mum but when someone offers to help by looking after her first kid for a while, she refuses all help and acts like a martyr. She and I have been drifting apart anyway and the multiple times I've tried to repair any rifts both before and after she was pregnant have been ignored or she's just not shown up. To be honest, I was worried about losing her as a friend before I deleted her, but after the deed was done, I felt a lot better. I didn't block her so if she wants to try and mend bridges, I'll give her a shot but if she steps in it again, she's gone.

Now, I know it's a lot of work to bring up a little creature in this world.  I anticipate lots of frustration with trying to teach this small, smelly, messy thing how to behave when it can't even communicate properly.  There will be messes everywhere and food strewn about the floors.  I'll have to be much more up close and personal with feces than I have ever wanted to be.

My girlfriend isn't so sure about the idea.  I know that if I make this decision, I'll be stuck with most (or all) of the work.  I also know that this isn't the time in our lives to be making this kind of leap.  But this is something I've wanted for my entire life, ever since I was a little girl.  I can't stop thinking about it, waiting for the day that I'll be ready.

Even with all the hardship, I believe that, as they say, it will all be worth it.  To look into those eyes and see nothing but unconditional love and trust.  To know that all my hard work has resulted in a happy, healthy being who will be a continual source of joy in my life.  

I just can't wait for the day when I finally get to bring my puppy home.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,False,,,True,t3_17xx2w,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/17xx2w/i_cant_deny_it_any_longer_theres_a_gap_in_my_life/,

It was awesome, having my name on the lease for the first time and finally feeling the effects of “living on my own”.  It’s a great place, I love it to bits…except for the neighbors under us.

So my cousin and I are pretty much past our “partying” phase, we don’t host parties anymore we just like entertaining friends and family once in a while.  We’ll drink, play board games, watch movies etc., but never anything crazy like blasting music and/or beer pong.

About a month after we moved in we decided to have some old friends and family come over for some drinking and game night on a Saturday night.  We didn’t have music on, we were playing Cards Against Humanity and drinking beer.  We weren’t dancing and jumping around, we weren’t screaming, the worst we were doing was laughing.

I wake up the next morning to take out the trash and when I come back I see a note attached to our door.  APPARENTLYYYYYYYYYYY the neighbors below us put in a noise complaint.  Ok, I get it, you have a kid, you’re trying to sleep and you want your kid to stay asleep throughout the night.  Well, dear neighbors, that same fucking kid of yours keeps me up all night ANYWAY because it’s constantly crying.  I swear to goodness, that thing is Satan’s spawn, it starts crying as soon as I lay down and close my eyes.  Like it *knows* and it’s just fucking with me.  I would love to file a noise complaint against your banshee sack, I assure you, it’s much worse than the sound of laughter.

It’s not fair that I have to put up with your shrieking baby and I’m too scared to fucking laugh in my own home.  Fuck you guys and your baby.

It's not like I have to stay up all night nursing our cats. I mean, I do but I don't *have* to.

Oh, you're a mommy? At one point in the past you gave birth, that's fine...so, y'know...what do you do? What's your job?

(Insert inevitable rant about the undervaluing of home labor, how hard stay at home mothers and fathers work, and absurd, pulled-out-the-ass statistics on the number of hours and dollar values attached to homemakers)

I stumbled upon an article (http://www.salary.com/mom-paycheck) that gives the purported salary of a stay-at-home mom, based on what they do, and the comparable private sector wages. AND IT IS RIDICULOUS. According to salary.com, the average homemaker performs labor worth $113,000/year, for working an absurd 94.7 hours/week. The chart details the types of ""work"" these parents do, including 25 hours a week cleaning, 14 hours cooking, 8 driving, 6 doing laundry, 9 of being a computer operator (?) 8 being a psychologist (??) and 3 as CEO (???). Regarding those last three categories, salary.com apparently equates playing Freecell, giving advice to children and making rudimentary household decisions with stressful, professional careers. Hell, they might as well toss in a couple hours of ""surgeon"" work for applying band-aids to scraped knees. 

I am far from the type of person who identifies oneself solely by his or her work; my job is what I need to pay my bills, what I ""do"" is the culmination of my diverse hobbies and interests. I am not my job. That said, I have a real job, outside of my home. When I come home from working all I day, I still have to do laundry, and run errands, and clean, and cook. This has nothing to do with children. This is just the cost of being an adult. If you want to stay at home while your partner works, that's fine. I'm not managing your household, and I wouldn't want to. But to claim that you have a real job for doing what we all have to do every day, regardless of our family unit, is ridiculous. You're not a full time parent; you're unemployed.

EDIT: 

I seem to be getting a bit of flack here, which is fine, but let me clarify my intention. I'm not saying child-rearing is easy. I'm referring to the (almost always) affluent, suburban stay-at-home parents who go out of their way to stress how hard it is to clean, do laundry, and handle other ""mom tasks"" that everyone else in the world, whether they have children or not, also have to do, IN ADDITION TO THEIR DAY JOBS. I have a lot of respect (and even a little bit of sympathy, those poor fools) for the parents who work all day and then take care of their kids in the evening.

My nursing class requires us to do a 'family assessment interview' with people at a local retirement home. My friend and I were assigned a lovely lady. She's nearly 89, was married, had a small extended family.

All throughout I was taking notes, and I had to keep scratching the premade 'questions' out because she doesn't have any children of her own. It broke my heart because she kept apologizing that she hadn't had children, because she didn't have any of the data we 'really wanted' and she 'must seem boring'. My partner, a mother, nodded her head and muttered something sympathetic like she agreed.

.... It left me dumbfounded. I had to spend 10 minutes just convincing her I DID want to hear her story, kids or not, and it was fucking amazing!

The woman is 89 and looks 70. She's completely mobile and able, a little memory issues but nothing close to her peers. She's lived in Singapore, Australia, Thailand, England, and Canada for extended periods of time. She worked in a munitions factory and her home was bombed during WWII.

Needless to say, there's no way she could have lived all over the world, volunteered as much as she did, LOOK the way she does at her age and have that kind of health had she had children. And she thought she had to *apologize* to me. All in all, the coolest, most badass and well-adjusted old lady I've met. My new role model.

And No, for the love of god, she's not afraid of dying alone. Her only surviving family is a niece across the ocean, and she's made her peace with that, as all of us will at some time or another.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,1359503584.0,,,True,t3_17iqi2,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/17iqi2/i_had_an_amazing_experience_with_an_89_year_old/,

I live in a neighborhood with a pool that comes along with a hefty home owners association fee each month and the FIRST DAY the pool opens for the summer,  a child shits in it. Not only did the child destroy that pool,  but somehow the indoor pool and the hot tub were also closed for 'fecal reasons'  which resulted from the parent somehow dipping the soiled child into all three of the pools. 
It's been almost a week and the pool is still closed,  rendering all of the fees we pay to use them useless. I propose if your child shits in the pool,  YOU are responsible for paying back everyone in the neighborhood that doesn't get to use it. Not that that would ever happen. Also why the fuck do parents put their non potty trained children in the water?  It's so incredibly inconsiderate to everyone else. I don't care if the kid is wearing a swim diaper,  I have seen horrendously runny stools in my babysitting years that escape the diaper and run down the abuser's legs.

[Rant],Cameo985,445,82,302,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1hggur/you_will_not_make_me_feel_guilty_for_trying_to/,"Today my husband and I just signed a contract with a homeowner so that we can get started on getting a loan for her house. We're incredibly excited since it will be our first home together and we won't have to depend on my husband's family for a place to live anymore.

Turns out though, we were not the only ones interested in this place. Apparently one of my co-workers was looking at it also and wasn't too happy when she found out that she probably wouldn't be getting it because of me. She also told me that my husband and I don't need that house and all of its space (over 2,000 sq ft).

The reason: she and her husband have 5 kids and all we have are dogs and cats. I told her she should have thought about it before having so many kids, I got a nice dagger to the heart look from her for that remark. She acted that just because she had so many kids, that I should feel guilty or bad that I was ""taking"" this home away from them. Not a chance.

I'm going to live the crap out of this house. I have plans already on how I want to update the house and what will go in what room. I plan to fill it with lots of visiting friends and family and have a place that I finally never have to move from.  

I love kids and can't wait to have my niece finally get to come for a visit or have my husband's second cousins stay the night. Just because we won't have kids of our own to fill the space, doesn't mean we don't deserve this amazing home that we've worked our butts off for.

TL;DR: It helps having a mom that's a loan officer that can send me necessary forms at 9pm on a Sunday night so that we can get them signed 12 hours later so my husband and I can get an awesome home.

**Edit: Thanks for all the support everyone. We have the paperwork put in for our loan and assuming all goes well the house will be officially ours in however long the process takes. I don't know how long it will take my co-worker to get over it, but other people I work with are very excited for me and are very supportive.

This woman said ""I just don't understand how you can spend so much money on your cat like that. I would just let it die.""

I almost jumped out of my skin.  I looked at her and said ""Well, I feel that way about your children.""

This morning, I finally did it. I have officially joined the ranks of the vasectomied (vasectomized?)!

The procedure itself was nerve wracking. The urologist had to give me some extra anesthetic (I felt the first cut -- there's no way to adequately describe that pain, and just how shocking it is). I was shaking, and I had to really control my breathing.  Despite that, I tried to make small talk, but it's difficult when there's a man tugging and cutting on your junk.

I'm so happy that I was able to have this procedure without any trouble. I'm 33 and single, I realize I'm in the minority of men that get vasectomies, but I know it was the right decision.

I don't know how may of you have had personal experiences, but being from rural Kentucky high school I can confirm that every year someones name was whispered right along with the word ""pregnant"" and everyone knew and looks of concern washed over their faces as most of them opted for a fast track to graduation alternative school. 

For me, I never questioned their choices because I knew it was their body, their child and ultimately their responsibility but seeing a very sweet girl cry on graduation day as her petite figure sported a fashionably floral baby bump broke my heart. 

Sometimes I wondered if these girls had anyone to talk to, if they had ever considered that nasty alternative, abortion. I can tell you that 100% of the girls rumored to be pregnant in my school had their child. The few that ended up staying at the main campus of my high school always seemed exhausted, struggling to maintain their grades. 

America as a society, no matter how progressive, takes it's youth so seriously it is not willing to recognize that their precious little snowflake ages and the hormones set in, they are going to make mistakes and those mistakes are going to have consequences. 

For that reason alone, it seems abstinence only education is being pushed but we all know it only takes one cute boy with a nice car and some sweet talk to get a teenage girl to slip off her panties. One time is all it takes to make a huge mistake and do you think a teenage boy is going to stick around to help out with that baby? Absolutely not.

America, especially the conservative party, doesn't want to acknowledge the fact that kids have sex. Maybe because the idea is just too unsavory and unholy for them to fathom but at the end of the date, even a good christian boy or girl will do anything to get that longtime crush of theirs. 

Instead of feeling sorry when your child fails the pregnancy test now a days, just accept it, celebrate it and move on. Hip hip hooray, you can validate your own morality by forcing it onto your already confused and scared child bullying them through a pregnancy they didn't plan with a smile to guilt them into thinking that they haven't thrown away their future. They can still do everything they planned on doing and hell they can try to get on TV while they're at it.

Of course contraception and abortion are hushed words in the squeaky clean community where you raised your child. They consider every embryo alive before the sperm hit the egg and now they have absolutely no way out of the situation. This is a consequence well deserved by acting out of the guidelines that you have set and now they have to deal with it. 

This mentality is not only harmful to youth, but dangerous if society would like to experience any progression. Children should not be a punishment, they should not be consequence and they should not be a forced regret because you guilt trip scared teenage girls into keeping their babies. 

This all raises the question why should the child-free community care? Well the answer is simple, if we want a better generation and we shouldn't procreate we should just create it. Through education and resources because a lot of the shittiest parents out there are the ones who force their individual beliefs about contraception and abortion on to their children. 

Just think, if the legal age of consent is 16 in the state of Kentucky then why should someone who is allowed to engage in consensual sex not allowed to prevent an unwanted pregnancy? Why is it boys can just walk out on a pregnant girl and she can't just extract the embryo and get it over with?

If any teens come across this post, get yourself educated, discuss these things with your parents or trusted adult no matter how uncomfortable they may be because if you find yourself in one of these situations you are going to need someone to lean on. If you indeed find yourself considering an abortion one day remember that aside from your partner (if one is involved.) The decision is ultimately yours and you now have to make your decisions like an adult.

As we get older, we are expected to become more mature and open, the closed off minds, no matter how close to you should be ignored. That goes for child free adults as well. It makes me sad to see that we are so stuck on an issue of societal advancement that could truly be more beneficial to this world than people are willing to admit. 

The list of requirements for abortions is absurd. Ultrasounds aimed at guilt tripping women into keeping an unwanted child. It sickens me to think of the women who now regret letting themselves be tricked into having a child they neither planned on nor wanted.

I'm not saying that this is the appropriate avenue for every accident, but they do happen and you do have a choice those who want to remain child - free need to be adamant in the fight for this right because seeing the american government as it is, those rights are disappearing at an alarming rate. 


Edit: Yes, girls want to have sex at a young age just as much as boys, everyone is pretty hormonal as a teenager. Thanks for all the upvotes, this is a big issue that I have been trying to tackle as I do my best to get involved in women's rights. I really do appreciate everything this community has to say. 

Edit 2: So I have heatedly debated with another redditor in this thread, and I apologize if anyone finds some of the comments I have made offensive. I have tried to stay close to the issues at hand. Teenagers, I apologize the majority of you aren't stupid. You find meaning and truth in life just like an adult, you're coming into your own skin and identities at a crucial point in your lives. I was just speaking from personal experience and as a former teen myself I can confirm that you will develop some intricate and meaningful relationships at this time in your lives. Just try not to over complicate them too much. I ended up marrying my high school boyfriend after we dated for three years. It's a difficult journey for those who make the decision to abort, scary and if it were up to me these kinds of things would not happen. Sadly, they do and that's why I'm happy this has been discussed.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,1373523910.0,,,True,t3_1hzr52,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1hzr52/its_okay_to_say_it_ladies_abortion_is_perfectly/,
1367245365.0,350,self.childfree,1dc79r,How DARE anyone question her child when he's recklessly damaging public property... ಠ_ಠ,Jackpot777,404,54,67,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1dc79r/how_dare_anyone_question_her_child_when_hes/,"Saturday afternoon, my wife (of twelve years) and I were walking our two dogs in the park. Lovely spring weather. You get the picture.

We turn the corner to the picnic grove with its 20-feet-tall fountain feature. All four tables were taken. The water hasn't been turned on yet, so right now it's a twenty feet tall cascading rock feature with boulders the size of a six year-old child's head.

And scrambling around this loose stone feature was a six (or so) year-old child. Climbing his own personal Everest, throwing the rocks around like The Hulk. They made the sound rocks would make when they're about the size of a child's head, and they hit other rocks from a height. It's not a quiet sound. It sounds like dry rock smashing into dry rock.

Plan A: I stared for thirty seconds. Nobody noticed, so nobody was looking at me (a grown man looking at a child) or the child. That's when I knew Plan A was unsuccessful so I started Plan B.

""You. Kid. Off. NOW.""

As the kid moved off the rocks that could have snapped his legs like twigs has he dropped one of the rocks on them, a very indignant woman rose from a picnic table and said, ""who are you to talk to my child?""

""Who am I? Apparently, I'm the man telling your child to get off public property that he's damaging before he injures himself and you sue the city for it, pushing my taxes up higher. That's who I am.""

""You could have come to me. I'm his mother.""

That's when my wife spoke. ""And how would we know that? Go up to a child in public and ask him if his parents are nearby? You want strangers doing that? Coming up to your child and asking where you are, instead of you doing the parenting?""

I've never been so proud of her.

""He's my son and you can't talk to him --""

""He's your son and you weren't parenting. If there's one thing I hate more than misbehaved children, it's parents that make excuses for their misbehaving kids.""

We then walked off. It used to be the case that people looked out for others in their community, and that included the notion that any adult could keep kids on the straight and narrow. Not hit them, not put the fear of god in them, but make sure they were acting as society expects. [I'm glad to see that others still feel that way](http://www.mamapedia.com/article/so-far-as-im-concerned-any-adult-can-discipline-my-child), but this Mother Of The Year was astonished that anyone DARE speak to their special little destructive snowflake like that.

I don't need to be a parent to know that's bad news for the kids that are allowed to get away with destructive behavior like this. And these are the parents I can't abide ...and their ranks seem to be swelling. Parents: I decided not to be a parent because I didn't want kids, I did the simplest of cost to benefit weigh-ups and knew it wasn't for me, I knew I didn't want to parent. You. Are. Parents. For fuck's sake, start acting like it and do some parenting.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,1367245617.0,,,True,t3_1dc79r,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1dc79r/how_dare_anyone_question_her_child_when_hes/,

Without the birth control pills and condoms it was weird and very difficult to get in the mood. I had been told for years my nervousness and fear about becoming a dad were normal for men, so I did my best to put it in the back of my head and enjoy myself. Then she started wanting sex twice a night instead of twice a week and, well, I lost my sex drive entirely. Seriously, nothing. I lost all interest in sex. This greatly upset her and confused the heck out of me. I actually like kids and she felt rejected in the worst way.

It did not stop her from getting truly desperate though: I woke up once to find her trying to rape my morning wood. We didn't talk to each other for a week after ""the incident"". It seemed so fake. She wasn't being intimate, she was just extracting genetic material. Was children the only reason she married me? I felt used, disgusted and confused.  I liked kids, I loved my new wife, why wasn't my junk working? Why didn't I want this?

After a few weeks of confusing emotions on both sides, we agreed to put off having kids and started having sex again, with protection.
She moved out six weeks later after I caught her with the drug addict from work ""helping us conceive"".

This is where my journey to being childfree began. I was a guy that would rather not have kids, even in ideal conditions, but had convinced myself otherwise, telling myself for years that it was just common jitters and doubts.

",Wolfsong013,406,64,144,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/155clh/rant_why_am_i_looked_down_on_for_bringing_my/,"I have a service dog to help me through my everyday tasks. I have severe PTSD, and she helps me control my flashbacks, as well as to keep calm in triggering situations. Surviving through the 2011 Tohoku Earthquake, and spending month volunteering after means that I am super sensitive to the sounds of crying and shouting. Because of this, she is highly trained for anything, from walking around shopping centers, to silently sitting under my table at a restaurant. Admittedly, I initially felt embarrassed having her lead me around, but I grew more comfortable over time. 

Until: Parents see a dog, and release their children on her.  When I ask people not to pet her since she is working, I always hear the same thing, ""Why would you bring a dog here if you wont let the kids play with it?"". Well, maybe it's because I f***ing need her. And I hate that all parents immediately assume that my dog, who is uniformed and working, is just a play toy for their bored children.  

There is also the complainers. I understand if someone has an allergy to dogs, which means I will gladly move to another seat, or table. I don't want to make anyone uncomfortable within reason. But! There is also issues with this too. The mother who asks if her kids can pet the dog, and after politely refusing, starts making a scene about a dog in a restaurant. This particular incident was all while her kids were screaming, teasing each other, and throwing things (soy sauce, chopsticks, food) around the restaurant in their tantrums. During all of this, my dog was still sitting still and silently under my chair. After such a scene, the managers asked me if I would move to help calm the waters. Even across the room, I could hear screaming children, a shouting mother, and things being thrown around. The whole environment was a terrible trigger, and I was the one who was moved in the far corner. That woman needs to chain up her hell spawn until they know how to act in public. I was disgusted that the woman treated me so poorly, when she had such disgusting creatures as children. And saddened that management wouldn't ask her to come back another time when her children were more adult or hire a freakin' sitter (see [Is it really that hard to get a baby sitter] (http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/153w2c/is_it_really_that_hard_to_get_a_babysitter_rant/) )

I guess the whole summary of the rant: Why are people such assholes about my service dog, who has never done anything wrong, but totally okay with children acting like monsters in public? I'm told that not all children behave like that, but almost all that I encounter do. Is it just me, or do you all have similar stories/situations?

Women are the ones who have to carry another hungry, rapidly growing human in their bodies for 9 months before painfully shoving it out in a bloody mess. Then, according social norm, the mother has to nurse the baby to adulthood, spending thousands upon thousands of hours making sure their human creation somehow stumbles into adulthood. 

It makes me think. What does a guy have to do? Well, first off all, we get an orgasm. Then for 9 months we have to not fully acknowledge what our seed has done to this woman. We even get to be mildly annoyed that this is hurting them so much! 

And then the birth happens. We get to stand by and watch the lady fall apart into a bloody mess before our eyes, but it's okay, because we'll be a father! When the baby comes out, we get to cut the umbilical cord, kind of like cutting the ribbon at a completed construction project, that's pretty fun, too! Then we get to hold the little tike for the first time, he looks just like us! (by the way, it has better be a ""he"" 

Then you bring the baby home. You cuddle your mirror image for a couple weeks, a month, take turns feeding it a couple of times, but whoa there! Someone's gotta pay the bills honey, you'll better refill that bottle, because daddy can't do that when he's at work, now can I? See you later! 

Ah, fatherhood is such hard work, but it's completely worth it! 

Being male and CF isn't as condemned as being female and CF for the reasons I highlighted above. Society expects the female to put so much pain and effort and time and misery into it, and they'd better be happy for the opportunity, damn it! Why aren't you using your reproductive skills???? 

But if a male declares himself CF, most people don't say ""But you're denying your body the right to reproduce! You're worthless"" They'll mostly say ""Huh, okay. Don't you want someone with your last name, though?""

This year, I noticed a decline in jobs from one of my best clients and asked the video-person-in-charge about it.

It seems that one of the other employees (who does freelance camerawork for them and ALREADY has work) has been given some of my edits.  The reasoning?  ""He has a child to care for and needs more money?""  I'm sure I don't have to explain my anger/frustration/shock over that statement.  Really?  If you have a child that you can't afford you get more work but if you're childless with terrific job performance you get less work?  I don't think so.  I need that money just as much as he does - I have a mortgage, a husband, and a business to run, my needs are JUST as valid as his.

I went over his head to the owner/higher managers.  Explained the situation and the response of the video-manager.  I also suggested that I shouldn't be penalized for making good life choices and reiterated that I have a spotless 8 year record with them.  I ended with reminding them that the employee now getting my work has had a terrible track record (within their own company) and referenced a few disgruntled clients.

Apparently, the other employee was being given my work under the table.  He was being paid under the table.  He was fired, the ""video-manager"" is still there but has been stripped of most of his power and I now report to someone else.  And I now have so much work that I'm running out of room.

Getting a little tired of all the accusations that we all hate children here. Some do, but you know what? It's their right to do so. Unless they are going around beating up children, they're not hurting anybody.

I don't mind being around well-behaved children. I don't have any desire to interact with most of them, but I don't have a problem with them. I've even babysat for my cousin on occasion.

What I hate is parents who ruin my nice dinner or the movie I just paid an inordinate amount to see because they bring their baby along and ignore it as it it howls its head off. I don't care what anybody says, that is inconsiderate and it's wrong. That's the compromise you have make when you have kids - get a sitter or stay home. Or order takeout or wait for the movie to come out on DVD. Just because you have children doesn't give you the right to ruin MY night. 

I have nothing against parents who have upset children and they are making a good faith effort to calm them down. What enrages me is when the kid is howling and mom and/or dad completely ignore it. And I don't believe the whole ""Oh you just start tuning it out eventually"" bullshit, because I've seen plenty of parents quiet their kids when they cause a ruckus, or take them out of the room. I admire parents like that. I understand kids get fussy, there is no way around that, but FUCKING TRY TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. That is all I ask.

I dislike people (parents) who seem to think they know what's going on in my head better than I do and tell me I will change my mind about having kids. That is condescending and insulting.

I dislike people who think the world revolves around them for any reason. Many parents seem to think the world revolves around them simply because they have children. This irritates me.

I also hate bad pet owners. I **love** animals but if you're a bad pet owner and you let your dog howl all night and disturb my peace, that animal becomes a nuisance to me and I feel anger towards the owner. It's the same thing as me hating bad parents. Both are irresponsible and inconsiderate, two things that I cannot tolerate.

I'm probably going to get creamed for comparing anything child-related to animals but it's true.

tl;dr I don't hate kids or parents, I just hate inconsiderateness and unfortunately I run into a lot of inconsiderate parents. That is all.

And I gotta admit that at first it worried me a little. I was thinking about my grandma who just lost her husband last year and despite having 4 child, who visit her quite often, is terribly alone and that makes me really sad. I was like ""Damn, if even with a large and loving family like this you end up feeling sad and alone, I don't want to know what it's like to be an old person without family.""


But then I realized something (and I've never see this argument on this subreddit) : 

**I will be old in an entirely different generation than my grandmother.** 

Seriously, just think about it! My grandma was raised in a farmer education and is very ""old school"". She lives in a big house, she doesn't have internet, a smartphone, or things like this. What does she do? A little gardening here, some painting eventually. But those activities doesn't help with loneliness. 

And then I think about what I will have. Damn. I'll be playing the new Xbox 9 or whatever, with cool 3D-holographic feature, being insulted by some 12 years old because I beat his ass while laughing! Then my game will be interrupted with a skype-thingy call, and will display one of my friends or something that want to chat or grab a beer or something. I'd be connected all the time with everyone I know. Traveling will be even easier than it is now, I'll have news from everyone, at everytime. Etc... you get the idea. It will be much easier to be old in our future.

What do you think ?

Today while riding in the car with my mum, she drops this latest one on me. 

""I found all your dancing outfits [I did Highland dancing from age 3-10], so you have to make sure my granddaugher does Highland dancing."" 

When I told her for the umpteenth time that I am not having children and therefore will not be giving her a granddaughter, her genuine response was ""Well, what am I supposed to do with them?"" I told her she can do whatever she likes with them, to which she responds ""Well in that case I'm going to keep them for my granddaughter, and you have to make sure I have a granddaughter because I don't do boys.""

Just.... ugh. I have the grand kid argument with my mother on a fairly regular basis but today words fail me. I'm not pushing out a kid just so she has something to dress up in a kilt. And what pisses me off the most is her utter denial of my not wanting/having children.

I'm currently studying to become a marine biologist and I am very passionate about it. It breaks my heart to think about all the pollution going into the water, all the sharks being mutilated for their fins, and the species being driven into extinction by commercial fishing.

So for a week, my family and I went to our favorite beach in South Texas, where we've been going for several years. This time we decided to go on a dolphin boat tour for my dad's birthday. The boat was *swarming* with shrieking children, one of which started following me around the boat trying to talk to me until I went to the top deck where she couldn't follow.

Things started looking up when I discovered that the tour included a trawl, which I was very excited about. For those that don't know, a trawl is when a large net is dragged along the bottom of the ocean to stir up and catch any critters lurking there so they can be examined (or eaten if it happens to be a shrimp trawl).

Our captain put the catch into a long trough in the center of the boat so everyone could see and touch the animals. He explicitly stated to not hold the fish out of the water for more than five seconds, and to be very very gentle with them. 

Within ten minutes, the swarm of crotch droppings had suffocated a beautiful band-tailed [sea robin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_robin), ripped the sponges off the shells of three sponge crabs, broken the claw of a blue crab, snapped the arms off most of the starfish, and torn the wing of a baby stingray (which was actually in a separate, clearly marked LOOK BUT DON'T TOUCH bucket because of it's poison tail-barb).

I tried to move around and ask the kids to be more gentle, but the majority of them were defended by their idiot parents saying infuriating things like ""Oh, they don't know any better, just let them have their fun,"" and ""Don't you dare tell my little girl that she's killing the fish! She thinks it's asleep and I will not have her traumatized!"" (no joke, a mother actually said this to me even as her sausage-fingered loinfruit threw a [striped burrfish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Striped_burrfish) back into the tank).

I don't know which ones I wanted to get away from the most.

I wont even bother with throwaway accounts, this is how I feel and I can't change a thing about it.

I love my son Luca. He is 5. He loves Angry Birds, Star Wars and Harry Potter. He is funny, sweet and very compassionate. He is a very geeky kid but in a cool kind of way. He doesn't misbehave any more than a regular 5 year old.


I love him but if I could go back and do things over I would have gotten an abortion.


It sounds horrible but I just don't like children. I am so tired of pretending. I had no idea that I didn't but I honestly know now that I should never have been a mother. I've never hurt Luca and I never will, its just I don't like children and having him reminds me of my dislike for them every single day.


Growing up I was conditioned to think I had to get married, have children, raise them, help raise my grandchildren and die. I never knew or even thought that NOT having them was an option. In my family everyone has children its just the way things work but I don't have the motherly instinct. I’ve said this so many times to so many people and they all just say I'm crazy and that I was made to be a mother but I wasn't. I don't think children are cute. They are gross little things full of germs. They suck the life right out of you. They make me cringe every time I have to be in a room with them.


From the moment I held him I knew I shouldn't have been a mother but every one told me how happy I would be once I had him and how amazing motherhood would make me feel but I have never once felt that way. I'm not depressed or have some other disorder. I am a perfectly healthy person who doesn't like children.


My boyfriend and I were surprised when I got pregnant, he just automatically assumed we would have Luca and he told everyone before I could even wrap my head around the idea... like a coward I kept Luca even though I felt something was wrong with this idea. Everyone says I am a great mom because Luca is involved in so many activities and he’s always so happy. They don't know he’s involved in so many different things because I want to spend as little time with him as possible.


I do love Luca but I know it’s not the same as the other mothers love their children but it'll have to do. He has an amazing father and family who shower him with love. If Luca's father and I every split up, I'd beg/make him take custody. I will do everything in my power to make sure he grows up in a loving, caring and safe home and wants for nothing but I will always know that if I had a second chance or a ""do over"" he would not be here and that i would be happier this way.

This led to us talking about my childfree stance. He was in complete agreement. He went one step further. He told me that he loved me and my 2 brothers. However, he thinks about the life that he may have had if he had chosen to for go children. He told me that he thinks that it is in my best interest to not have children. He said he wouldn't take having me back, but it's something he wished he had thought about more before having children simply because society told him to do so. He thinks that the childfree will have the best chance when the shit starts to rise.

I told her that I would like to talk about being childfree and that I felt like they just haven't marketed to that demographic.

That is to say that I **announced** my desire to not have children for the first time when I was 5 and now, at 41, I can say with all certainty that I have not ""changed my mind"", as so many well-meaning idiots told me I would in my twenties.

Reading /r/childfree reminds this *mildly older* (edited from ""old"") woman a lot of its Usenet predecessor, *alt.support.childfree*, a group that I used to read and post to in my twenties, back before most people had heard of the Internet. The posts here are the same essentially. I mean, not nearly enough has changed for childfree people in the past 20 years, although the numbers joining our ranks have risen. The frustration, especially for those who are young and single, is still the worst part of being childfree. In my opinion, it's still the main worst thing.

After reading a rant I could have written myself twenty years ago, with older, less furious eyes, I wanted to write something to myself, that 22 year old reading alt.support.childfree and writing those same frustrated rants, and for you who are younger here. 

First and foremost:


IT GETS BETTER
----

Seriously, it really and truly does. They will be small changes, but they'll add up.

* When you find a life-long partner (should you want to) who is also committed to remaining childfree, **it will get better**. You'll have someone else on this team with you. In my case, it helped that he wasn't as adamant either way as I was. He just didn't care. I saw how things rolled off his back so easily, and adopted his approach. When people asked him if he wanted children, he didn't get offended, he just said, *""I believe it's irresponsible to have kids if you don't really, truly in your heart want them. Otherwise you're just putting them on the therapist's couch someday... It's not a hobby.""* This line - said in a matter of fact and calm tone, remarkably shuts just about everyone up.

* When you have that life-long partner, you might also find annoying babies less stressful, because you know *for certain* you won't be pressured by a husband or wife into having them and **it gets better**. I swear, before I met my husband, half the anxiety and fury I heard at a baby screaming was an innate fear that I'd never find a man who would let me be childfree - especially after a terrible breakup with a bastard who used wanting children as a reason to cheat on me. Now I chalk the screaming babies up as ""fucking annoying"" and move on and *away*.

* As you get older, some of your friends will ""age out"" of having children along with you and **it will get better**. (This happens starting in your late thirties.) You may or may not know if they are CF as well, but there will be some you definitely didn't figure on not having kids. It will surprise you, the hidden childfree people you find in your ranks.

* The first time a parent/friend of yours secretly confesses, *""Don't ever have children! You made the right choice!""* **it will get better.** The second and third times you hear this, you will still be surprised. The 24th and 25th times you hear it, it will just be what parents sometimes tell you.

* When you find a doctor to give you a tubal ligation or vasectomy **it will get better**. You can find such a doctor, although you must be persistent and it may take a year or two of being committed to the idea. If yours isn't that doctor and you're in your twenties, then look for another doctor. Tear up that phone book making calls. Ask around in local forums. It may take awhile, but don't take ""no"" for an answer. My doctor consented after 2-3 years of treating me as a single woman. The first time I brought it up, I only casually mentioned it so he'd know it was a priority for me. At the beginning of the 2nd year I asked about having the procedure done. He asked me to wait a year and at my next annual if I still felt the same way to let him know. I came in the third year and it was the first thing I wanted to discuss, and he scheduled it for me. To his and the hospital's credit, absolutely no one made judgmental remarks. When you *know* you won't accidentally get pregnant, **it gets better**.

* When you reach your forties, especially as a woman, people make *assumptions* and they stop asking you rude questions and **it gets better**. I get ""the question"" maybe once or twice a year now, usually from twenty-something woman who is simply clueless.  And you know what? When I respond with, *""I just don't believe you should have a child unless it's a true, burning desire in your heart, otherwise the kid's just going to end up on a therapist's couch.""* some of them say, *""You know, that is so smart. I wish more people (even once, ""my parents"") thought like you.""*

I hope you all have a wonderful holiday, filled with joy and happiness and NO NOSY QUESTIONS! And just remember, **IT GETS BETTER.**

**Edited to add an anecdote about Mr. Southpaw:** We were driving down the freeway and passed a mini-van clearly on a road trip. Luggage on top, kids screaming in back, a furious mother yelling at them and a father driving who looked beaten down on the driver's side. As we passed, they were making such a ruckus, and the father looked so miserable, that we both stared. My husband said as we passed, ""You know what that is honey?"" I said, ""What?"" He just said in a very sarcastic voice, ""The American dream!"" And we both howled with laughter.

To this day, whenever we see that family that's clearly miserable, Mom screaming, Dad sullen, kids tormenting everyone and everything in sight, my husband quietly mutters, ""...American dream"" in my ear and we both start chuckling.

&gt; But all seven of her children died from a rare genetic disease that affects the central nervous system - three of them just hours after birth.

&gt; When her fourth child, Edward, was born, doctors discovered the disease was caused by a defect in Sharon's mitochondria.

&gt; ...

&gt; Edward survived into adulthood, dying in 2011 at the age of 21.

1352223756.0,288,self.childfree,12qmis,State of the subreddit: New Rules (very long. READ IT!),MrLyle,377,89,188,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/12qmis/state_of_the_subreddit_new_rules_very_long_read_it/,"Hello everyone. We wanted to inform you of a couple of rule changes we're implementing in order to make sure the subreddit runs a little more smoothly for everyone, and to hopefully make the experience a little more pleasant.

The first rule we decided to add is no more linking to reddit. What we mean by this, is that we don't want reddit itself to be a source of content on /r/childfree. This includes linking to posts in other subreddits, as well as posting permalinks to comments on other subreddits. 

Cross posts (x-posts) are still allowed provided they are completely contained within /r/childfree. What this means is, you may x-posts pictures from other subs, or x-post an article you may have found on another sub. What you can't do is x-post something you found on another subreddit, and have the link actually send everyone to the subreddit where you found it.

Why are we doing this? There's been a recent trend of people linking to posts on other subs, followed by comments criticizing the posts and the comments they contain. This is unacceptable behavior. We don't like it when our own posts and comments get criticized on other subreddits, and we will not be hypocritical by doing the same thing to other subs. This subreddit already has a very bad reputation, mostly unjustified. We will not start behaving like SRS and link to posts and comments in other subs and circlejerk about how we disagree, how stupid they are, and how awesome we are. This is not what this sub is about. I realize that some of you may not care what other people think, but we are part of the reddit community and we will not criticize and insult other subreddits' content. Even if they are doing it to us. Linking to reddit is officially over. There are plenty of other sources to get content from.

The second rule we're implementing has to do with with the pets and free time posts. The problem we're currently having with pet posts is that people come down the middle on this issue. On the one hand you have people with a mindset of ""If I don't care about baby pictures, what makes you think I care about your pets?"". And on the other hand you have people for whom pets are a huge part of being childfree and they want to share it.

The free time posts are also problematic. These are posts where people post pictures of what they did on the weekend, what they do at night, and what they plan on doing with the new stuff they bought from all the free time and extra money they have as a result of being child free.

The main problem with both kinds of posts is that they generate absolutely no meaningful discussion. The comments in the pet posts amount to ""awwww, s/he's sooooooooooo cuuuuuuuuute!"" and the comments in the free time/extra money posts amount to ""That's awesome! Here's what I do/did/plan to do/bought!""

Posting something while adding ""...because I'm childfree!"" at the end is way too broad a criteria for posts on this sub. You can literally post **anything** and add ""...because I'm childfree!"". Like a picture of me eating ice cream on Thursday afternoon ""look what I'm doing cause I don't have to go home to kids!"" or ""Look at these awesome glasses I bought cause I don't have to spend all my money on kids!"" or ""checks out this pic of my alarm clock! Don't have to wake up early for kids!!"". These are nothing but cheap karma threads, and whether intentional or not, they add nothing to the discussion. It's basically the same thread over and over again, only with a different picture.

What to do about this? We decided that every Friday we're going to post a thread called ""Freedom Friday"". In this thread, you guys can post literally anything you want. Pictures of your pets, pictures of what you bought with all your extra cash, pictures of where you've been traveling cause you have free time, discuss what you plan on doing on the weekend, and so on. We're gonna keep all of it for that thread every single Friday. If you don't like the pet pictures, don't click on them. If you only like the free time stories, only go through those. Use this thread as you will.

This means that outside of the ""Freedom Friday"" thread, there will be no more pet pictures and no more picture posts who's sole justification is ""...cause I'm childfree!"". That includes, pictures of houses, cars, bikes, glasses, your bathtub, your ice cream, your coffee, your backyard...you get the point. Save all that stuff for Freedom Friday thread, which I expect will be a very busy and fun thread.

That's all we have for now. Feel free to ask any questions, we'll do our best to answer. Happy redditing good people.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,1352225209.0,,,True,t3_12qmis,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/12qmis/state_of_the_subreddit_new_rules_very_long_read_it/,moderator

And the like, etc...

It irritates the hell out of me.
EVERYONE manages their household budget. Everyone! People who live alone with no children do that AFTER working all day.

EVERYONE cleans their dishes, budgets for groceries, cooks. Everyone manages a household. Everyone has a schedule to keep, appointments to make. 

""If something is broken in the house I am the one that has to fix it!""

WELCOME TO ADULTHOOD. That is not a work-related skill that most people don't have, it's something anyone who has to work for a living has to do. EVERYONE has to do that. (except for the very rich, who hire a housekeeper...which is not the job you're applying for!)

It's like they think they are the only people on earth to cook a meal, figure out how to pay rent and bills...like parenthood actually gives them some kind of work experience. It doesn't.

I needed to vent. Figured this'd be a slightly safer space for it.

1370372743.0,282,self.childfree,1fo3p2,Childfree in Sociology Class,Kaiser7,318,36,135,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1fo3p2/childfree_in_sociology_class/,"I [24m] was sitting in my sociology class in college and we were talking about education in regard to school districts. The discussion was getting rather heated when my professor posited a question to me about my hypothetical future children, phrased as, ""what are you going to do with your children if...""

Assuming that because this is a sociology class in a northeast liberal college that different lifestyle choices are accepted and even encouraged, I volunteered that I did not want any children at all. 

The class went silent and my professor, perplexed, asked me how old I was. 

I must admit, I added a year to my age and looking back at it now I should've just replied with, ""Why? So you can tell me I'll change my mind?"" Instead, I told her that I was 25, to which OF COURSE, she states, ""Oh, you'll change your mind.""

Before I could interject, she proceeded to go around the classroom and ask everyone if they wanted children or not. After about 20 minutes, it was clear that I was the only childfree person in the room. 

Now I was a little upset and on the defensive because I felt like I was trying to be shamed into changing my opinion. 

The usual questions were brought up, ""what about your parents?"", ""you were a baby once,"" ""don't you want a legacy"", ""who will take care of you when you are older?"".

The best though was when someone asked me, ""What are you going to do with your money?""

I was confused. ""What do you mean?""

""When you're older. What are you going to do with your money if there is no one to leave it to?"" 

""I'm going to spend it on myself doing cool stuff.""

""So you're going to be blowing money when your 70?""

So, I'm a journalist and a few years ago (2006) I was sent to broadcast a game of the soccer world cup in Dortmund (Germany). 

Since the whole city was very crowded in traffic, I chose to use the subway in oder to get into the inner city. 


So: I was carrying all my equipment (a 18lbs professional television camera plus a 7lbs tripod). The underground arrived and I stepped back in order to let the subway riders to exit. 
But *of course* there was a mom with a stroller. She looked right at me and said (as if it was her birth right): ""YOU! HELP ME GETTING OUT WITH MY STROLLER!"". 
I said: ""I'm sorry - but actually I'm carrying heavy and expensive camera equipment - I cannot help you unfortunately. 
Just to be clear: I was sincerely sorry, because I usually help parents with a stroller all the time to get out of the underground - not a big deal for me usually. 
But then it happened: The Lady started cursing at me for being so inconsiderate. She said I was a bad person for not helping her - even though there were *a lot* of other people around who could have helped her. 

I said to her: ""Lady: Don't you see that I have **a lot** of heavy things to carry myself? I'm really sorry, but you're not the only one needing help here."" 

She was stunned - and left cursing at me, saying things like - translated - : inconsiderate cunt, bitch and child hater.  

The best thing was (faith in humanity restored) - an odler guy came up to me (when we were already in the subway driving later) and said: ""Fräulein, you were absolutely right - this lady was absolutely rude to you and you did the right thing"".

Why is it always the older people recognizing that parenting today is shitty? I would really like to know...

The makeup I work with ranges from $15-100+ so it is not a cheap endeavor when people come to buy for the most part. There is a  certain level of sanitation and hygiene that is called for with using these testers on people because of infection and whatnot.

That being said, I CANNOT STAND when people bring their kids into the store and let their hellspawn smear makeup on their dirty , germ-ridden and grimy faces. It literally makes me see red. People with little girls are especially horrible because they just let them run loose and touch everything.

   Yesterday, it was a 3 years old that had smeared lipstick all over her lips and put it back before being discovered by her mother. One of 15 $30 lipsticks, all of which I now have to sanitize so that someone doesn't get a face full of kid germs Russian roulette style when they're trying on makeup. 

Little kids smearing face makeup on their feet, opening $17 bottles of nail polish and spilling them everywhere,  little dirty hands touching all the eyeshadows. If  they're girls, the parents look on lovingly and laugh at the little girls ""playing with makeup"" and looking horrified if their little boy is caught touching anything (only because gender stereotypes, not for destruction of store inventory). 

I can't tell you how often I get handed merchandise that their kids have touched, knocked off the shelves and broken and customers start saying defensively "" I'm not paying for anything my kid broke!!""  What happened to ""you break it you buy it?"", and with the retail attitude of 'customer is king' there's nothing I can do to say or stop their kids from their wanton destruction of very costly merchandise. 

Sorry for the rant, I'm jut sick of literally cleaning all the makeup so that other people don't get sick from the germs of grubby children, whose hands have been who knows where.

With that said, I was never adverse to the notion either. Choice by choice, I would assess who I was with, how the relationship was going, where I was in my life as far as stability was concerned, etc. All of these little choices resulted in my reaching my 40s without a child. 

Two weeks ago I chose to get an IUD, which I plan to have until menopause. I've had fleeting thoughts about this being my ""final chance"" to get pregnant before the effects of age set in, and as I choose again, I am quite happy to say I don't want kids.

I don't think choosing to be childfree has to be a one fell swoop decision. For those of you with doubts or concerns, know that as each moment presents itself you are endowed with the beautiful ability to weigh your options, assess the situation, and make a choice you can live with later. 

Looking back I see my choices for what they were, and I understand myself in hindsight: my fears, concerns, and hopes for my future. I dont regret my choices because I've put some serious heart and soul into each and every one. Today at 42, I am quite content to say I actively chose not to have kids and it has made a positive difference in my life and I think I made the right choice every time.

I am fortunate to have many childfree friends in my life and I've noticed as I've age these people tend to radiate toward each other with their interests and lifestyles, so my 40's are shaping up to be very full of friendship, which I value above all else. 

Sorry for the wall of text, I just wanted to share my excitement and enthusiasm and encourage anyone to really listen to him or herself and honor your feelings and choices because there is also sacred in choosing to not procreate. We have an obligation, first and foremost *to ourselves* to give ourselves the fullest life possible, whatever that may look like.

I'm the eldest of four, I'm 26, my closest sibling is 19, and my mother is 48, everyone has an expectation that I'm going to settle down with a girl and start having the first babies for them all to shower with love.


SETTLE DOWN. What does that even mean?


I work 80+ hours a week and live in a remote area of Australia to make as much money as possible so I can travel as much as possible, I want to go all over the world, meet people, and get in adventures. This life I intend to lead is much too short for children. My older, married workmates say 'Yeah, enjoy yourself while you're young, when you're in your thirties and have a wife and kids, you won't be able to do all that'. I give them this perplexed look, and say: 'You know that you have a CHOICE to have kids or not right?' And get the dismissive 'Well, once you find the right girl you'll do whatever she says', or 'You'll get drunk one night and get some bitch pregnant'. If I could be bothered being offended, I would.


I believe your potential as a human being is limited, (often destroyed) by reproducing. I know my conclusion isn't all warm and fuzzy, but life isn't warm and fuzzy, so deal with it. We're here for 80 years if we're lucky, we spend the first 20 just trying to make sense of the world around us, and the last 20 are severely limited by our physical capabilities. That leaves 40 years in the middle where we can BE SOMETHING, DO SOMETHING, and LIVE. I think the social norm of tethering yourself to a dependent for HALF THAT TIME is beyond ridiculous. If I had a child tomorrow and decided to be a responsible adult, my dreams would be forever out of my reach. My earnings would be cut in half due to my inability to live on the job, my overtime would take a hit due to my inability to spend as much time at work. My holiday account would be accumulating wealth at 1/30th the rate. The goals I set for next month would be achievable next year. The goals I set for next year would be achievable next decade. The goals I set for next decade would be achievable next lifetime.

I would cease to be an individual, from that point, until some undetermined time 15+ years into the future, I become a full-time caretaker of another human being, an enormous responsibility that will stunt my growth as a person in every field I chose to devote myself to pre-child. Having this hypothetical child with a caring, nurturing woman would be the only saving grace. But how could I jog for an hour in the morning while she's feeding the baby? How could I, in good conscience fly myself overseas for a quick 5 day party holiday while she's taking the kid to school? How could I take a 6-month break to study unpaid, to improve my career when my wife has been a stay at home Mum for the last 5 years and has no current qualifications to supplement our income? I can't. I wouldn't. I would be another straight-faced drone that works to provide, too scared to live, paying bills and putting pennies away so that one day I can build a mancave in my basement, to drink beer and watch tv and forget about the predicament I got myself in.


When I become CarbonNightmare the parent, I cease to be CarbonNightmare the everything-else-I-could-have-been.

The women at work were talking about it the other day, mostly due to teen abortions. ""If you don't want children don't have sex! And if you have sex, be enough of a woman to raise a baby!"" Normally, I just say nothing, but this particular day I was feeling catty and said, ""so, I shouldn't be intimate with my husband?"" They were flabbergasted, and tried to explain that's not what was meant, etc. But were equally surprised to discover I don't like kids and don't want any and that I'm pro-choice. Then questioned me about my husband, who's adopted son is 18, ""doesn't he want his own child?"" I, as calmly as possible, explained that my husband loves his son just as much as any of them love their children, that he is his ""own child"", that I love my step-son, and that, no, we are quite content to our family being just the way it is, thank you very much. 

As a younger woman (virgin and not married woman) it made sense to me--the lovely quote that started it all. At that time I wanted a baby, and if you're going to sleep with someone you should know that having a child is a risk and be willing to deal with it. Now that I'm married and DO NOT want children, I shouldn't HAVE to take care of a baby because I had sex with my husband. And no one should HAVE to parent because they enjoy sex.

Now, I'm not saying we should use abortion as a form of birth control (edit: better word would be contraceptive), far from it! I think abortion should be legal, safe, and rare - in that forms of contraceptive birth control are readily available to everyone having sex, so that fewer unwanted babies are born/conceived to begin with. 

In conclusion, For the first time I realized that people assume that the only unwanted pregnancies are pregnancies out of marriage, and that because I'm married I must want children. Along the same line, it's interesting to me that though (in the US) abortion is HOTLY discussed and single women who get them are scorned in some places, married couples who abort are even more so.

You have been warned.

One fine morning, I leashed my three dogs up and took them for a walk at the local track, which leads to a dog park. I normally take them to the track and then the dog park, and do this about three times. I have a Golden Retriever, a German Shepherd puppy, who is 1 year old, and a Siberian Husky. The Golden Retriever and the Siberian Husky are three years old, and are extremely hyper, while the German Shepherd is shy around new people. The names, respectively, are; Sparky, Fluff, and Speedy. Crappy names, I know, but I like them. Oh, and these dogs are trained to behave.

So, anyways, I decide to, instead of walk it 3-4 times, jog it. I start to jog it from one side. I do ^3/4 of a circle, then go to the dog park entrance, to which I notice there are a lot of kids in the park, around 23 kids, which is extremely higher than the regular 2-6 kids. So, I enter, and the first thing that happens is many high pitch squeals rise from the park. Fluff, the German Shepherd, almost immediately goes behind the other 2 dogs, and tries to climb on Speedy's, the Siberian Husky's, back. As much as it pained me, I put Fluff back onto the ground, so he could grow to be more comfortable around people. I started to jog, and a lot of the kids there tried to touch and grab my dog whenever I passed them. The trouble starts when two kids start to follow me and my dogs.

The parents, I am assuming, laughed at the kids and started to walk towards us. I started to run, and after I thought I lost them, sat at a nearby bench to see if the leashes were too tight, and just check stuff. Suddenly, the two kids pop from nowhere and scream at my dogs, causing Fluff to yelp and holler, and hide his face in my jacket. I am protective of my dogs, so I get a little angry, but I can't get full blown mad, because they don't know what my dogs will do when faced with human interaction. After that, they proceed to climb on my other dogs and then pull hair from my dogs. The parents get around, and I tell them to control there kids, and that my dogs are rough when they play, only to be told that there two year old is **SO** strong and won't get hurt.

After some time, my dogs decided they had enough and tackle the kids down, to which I immediately call them back. The parents go ""OH MY GOD"" mode, and start yelling vulgar language and cursing at my dogs. The mom was about to smack my dog, when the Husband, I guess, came to sense and held her back, saying stuff like, ""He warned us"", and ""I knew we shouldn't have brought (name of kid 1 and kid 2)."" Eventually they left with the (crying) kids.

So, parents, if I warn you that my dogs are rough, please listen.

I am not harassed day in and day out, but after certain social gatherings where the pressure and questions are especially harsh I need somewhere to let out some steam.

To those people who maybe have a really supportive family and group of friends, you might think that some of us sound pretty bitter and harsh. To the people who are not childfree, we might look downright rude and vile.

But some of us have really bad days because of being childfree. Going to a family gathering, talking to certain co-workers, visiting with parents who really don't accept people not wanting children can leave you incredibly frustrated and hurt. Most of the rants I see on here are typed up after a tough encounter.  

I'm sure we all have our people in real life who support us, our SO's, friends, family.... but sometimes you need to let out things that even they wouldn't understand or things that you don't want to make them sit through. Sometimes a good rant or vent posted anonymously in this subreddit helps get the anger and hurt out.

Their rules are fantastic. No child under the age of 16 is allowed in the fenced in dark park. You can drink and sit around with other fur parents in a chill and relaxing environment, that is only riddled with some occasional dog drama which the owners handle with ease. 

A family showed up with two little girls under 10. They were in the waiting area about to come in and I instantly grabbed my dogs who aren't child friendly (wonder where they got that from ;).) The owner intercepted them and told them their policy- which is very well marked at the entrance. The kids started bawling, and the owner stayed strong. Made my cold, dark heart glow :)

1366216642.0,265,self.childfree,1cji8w,"So, this happened today.",WhiteShadow0909,307,42,136,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1cji8w/so_this_happened_today/,"I was in my house, doing some university coursework, when there is a bang on the door. I answer the door, and there are three kids (I'd say aged from 4 - 7). As soon as I open the door, they say ""Our cat went into your garden, can we come look for it?"". Just as a point of interest here, that cat is always wandering into my garden, but this is the first time they've come to look for it. I tell them that the cat will come back when it's hungry. They are not satisfied by this, so I tell them that they should go get their mum or dad and come back and ask, so their parent can look for the cat. When they ask ""WHY!?"" in that typical childish tone, I replied that I am a stranger to them, and they shouldn't go into a strangers garden without a parent. They wander off to go get their mum, and I go back inside. (Just to clarify, I am a COMPLETE stranger to these kids, all girls, and their entire family. I've seen them around the street, but have never spoken to any of them.)

After 10 more minutes or so doing my work, I decide it's time for a cigarette break. So, since there is no smoking allowed in the house, I head out my back door into the garden, lighting the smoke as I step out. As I walk further into the garden, I see them. The three girls AND their mother, wandering about. They have wandered onto another person's property to find a cat that will come home on its own anyways! I guess I did tell the kids that they could look if they bought a parent along... but surely, as an adult, you at least knock on the door and ask?

It get's better, though:

I approach the mother, with my still lit cigarette in my hand, and ask ""Can I help you?"". That, I promise you, is all I said. The reply came, ""We're looking for our cat!"". She almost spat it at me. She then continues, after noticing my cigarette, ""*gasp!* Are you smoking around my children!?"". A little perplexed, I indicate to her that her children are at the other end of the 50ft (ish) garden. She 'explains' that it doesn't matter how far away the kids are, she doesn't want them seeing a person smoking. She insists that I put it out immediately. Now, I'm not proud of this... but I lost it right there. In a mixture of humour (at how absurd she was being) and anger, I chuckled, and said ""Get the f**k out of my garden."" She was clearly offended, and stunned. So, I said again, a little politer, ""Get out. Now, please.""

She shouts for her kids, tells them that ""the bad man said we can't have Stripes back."" (I assume 'Stripes' is the cat's name?). The youngest girl starts to cry... but they leave. Mummy dearest stomping her feet as she goes.


**Just to be clear** - I have nothing against these children. They simply wanted their cat, and asked reasonably politely to go look for it. I have a problem with the parent, who, in my eyes, was less mature than her children and felt that her rights as a mother enabled her to come onto property she does not own, and dictate my actions. The actions of a person who LIVES THERE.

**Also to clarify** - I would have tried to retrieve the cat myself, but I am very allergic. 

I'm sorry for the wall of text. I really am. But I really just needed to vent and see whether or not you guys think I over-reacted. (I did swear rather loudly, with children in earshot.)

**TL;DR** - Kids want their cat from my garden. I say they can't come in without a parent. ('Cos, you know, a stranger inviting three little girls into his garden always ends super awesome for everyone.) They go and get their mother, who proceeds to herd her kids into my garden without my permission. When I ask what she's doing, she is disrespectful to me... because I am smoking... IN MY OWN GARDEN!

During labor many complications, wrong diagnosis, &amp; delayed treatment put my best friend into a coma after an emergency C-section. She passed away a month later. She never got to meet her little girl. During this difficult time my brother had to spend many hours at the hospital with doctors, doing extra research, and of course waiting by his wife's bedside. When he asked me to be the temporary main caregiver I was shocked but more than willing to help. I've made it clear all my life I never wanted children of my own. And here I was, getting to experience everything my best friend &amp; brother looked forward to. First bath. First smile. First squeak.  I, the biggest no children ever, kids are annoying, babies wreck life attitude...fell in love with this tiny, warm, pink human.  
It was unbelievably draining emotionally and physically. No sleep. Literally. Bottle warming, changing diapers, and crying was all I did.  It was the most confusing time of my life.  This was 2 years ago. I still feel guilty. I still do not want children. I got a tiny glimpse of what my husband and I would be like as parents. Our feelings remain the same.  Nothing is missing, we are still whole people, we still have dreams and goals. I cant believe how many friends and family thought this experience would make me want to be a parent. 
""Oh that looks good on you."" ""You two would make such good parents.""
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!? WE WEREN'T PLAYING HOUSE!!! I'm grieving, I'm doing my best just to get through the day, I'm helping out my brother, and now I'm scared for life about maternity &amp; delivery wards. 
My brother only needed our help on and off for a year. And then he moved back home on his own with my niece. I have a bond with my niece which will never go away. She is the only kid who equally lights up my world and breaks my heart :) She &amp; my brother are doing well. They've made their own comfy, imperfect, yet still happy life together. Seeing her grow is such a mix of sadness and happiness. She is EXACTLY like her mom.

No. Stop being the fucking PC brigade.

This is not /r/parenting.

Breeder is a specific term, about irresponsible parents who shit one out every 9 months, who take them into restaurants and bars, who say ""you'll change your mind"" to us, who let them scream for hours on end. It's the kind of people we see on STFUParents.

If you don't like it, if you think we should be nice to the breeders who never do the same back, I don't think we really share the same goals here. There are more than a few sympathetic people here with children, but they are always, *always* the considerate type of parent who doesn't act like an idiot breeder. I thank them for that.

Saying ""hey guise be nice to the parents"" won't do anything.

Edit: Just to clarify: No, I don't categorically dislike parents, or children. I know a few parents who are fine; they are absolutely not breeders. I'm not even an extreme child-hater just because I don't want them. As I said in one comment, I'm not disparaging all parents; I don't use breeder inappropriately, but I'm not going to walk on eggshells around all parents when some are completely inconsiderate / irresponsible. They aren't owed anything for their life choice, and I have no problem with someone who has a baby but doesn't take it into the cinema or a nice restaurant, doesn't change it in public, doesn't let it scream so you can hear it down the street all night; who has toddlers but doesn't let them run riot around the supermarket; who doesn't let their spawn generally take over every waking minute of their lives. People who do that are breeders, as are people on benefits who crap out more and more to leech more money from the taxpayer. People who have children responsibly are parents, and get my respect. There's a difference, and as such, I don't like seeing the word used inappropriately at all; I just find it appropriate for certain cases.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,1351798504.0,,,True,t3_12ga9a,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/12ga9a/yes_i_say_breeders_and_i_dont_care_who_i_offend/,

I thought I would share with you a small incident that occurred yesterday with an entitled raging parent, in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart, SHOCKING I know! 

Me and my SO were leaving Wal-mart and walking into the parking lot to get to our car when we both noticed a family parked right next to us loading up their groceries. There was of course, the parents, their 4 kids and what looked like another on its way, all packing up into a little Honda civic. They were parked pretty close to us but no worries, I was able to squeeze by to get into the car.

My SO is a VERY considerate, competent and overall great driver, which is why he drives at least 90% of the time. He starts to back out, VERY VERY slowly, keeping in mind the kids were right next to our car, and starts to pull out the OPPOSITE direction to try an avoid them when suddenly the dad came up to my passenger side window and shouted ""HEY MAN, YOU SEE MY KIDS?""

Both of us were confused, my SO replied, ""Yes I do, that is why Im backing out slowly"". The guy shouts back ""You shouldn't be backing out while my kids are still outside of the car man! You are gonna get your ass beat!"" WOAH now. Im starting to rage but my patient as ever SO says calmly to him ""Excuse me sir, I wasn't going to hit your kids, I was aware of them and watching them as I was backing out, we don't have time to wait for you to load up your vehicle, what kind of example are you setting for your kids being hostile for no reason?""

The guy is seeing red at this point and says, ""You know what man, you don't FUCK with me or my kids! You are acting all big because you're in a car, why don't you step out!"" I couldn't keep quiet anymore and I said ""THE WORLD DOES NOT REVOLVE AROUND YOUR SPAWN, HE SAW THEM AND WAS MINDFUL OF THEM, YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO COME UP TO US AND ACT LIKE A JACK ASS FOR NO REASON"" He started to scream at me saying that I was lucky I was a lady but I was going to get my man's ass handed to him.

So I interrupted his rant and shouted, ""Why don't you go BREED SOME MORE?"" and THAT line RIGHT there, ladies and gentleman, is what ended the argument. I have never seen a more dumbfounded look on a face in my life. My SO and I started BUSTING out laughing and he just flipped me off and went back to his car and we started to drive off. I was able to get a glance at the baby-mama and she looked SO CONFUSED. I am not sure she knew what just happened but we were seriously cracking up. What started out as rage, ended in laughter.

Good times.

I was never crazy about her, but the guy is a total sweetheart--funny, interesting, laid-back. His big thing is horror movies. He loves watching them, making them, writing about them. 

She's always been a bit domineering, and he's kind of meek. So when she moved things toward marriage, he went along with it, even though she never treated him very well. Not long after they got married, a bunch of us were out having drinks, and the wife said, ""I'm so glad I don't have to pretend to like horror movies anymore now that we're married!"" We were all shocked. Why would you lie to someone about sharing an interest in order to get them to marry you? Doesn't that doom both of you to unhappiness?

Well, the answer arrived not too long later. The wife has type 1 diabetes (the autoimmune kind, not the obesity kind), and she knew she wanted to have kids. Because of her diabetes, she had to start young, to avoid double-high-risk pregnancy. They even got infertility treatments when it didn't happen right away--well before most couples would start--because she wanted the baby NOW. Shortly after having the first kid, she got pregnant again naturally.

They moved to the suburbs, and I rarely see them anymore, but from what I glean from Facebook, the husband is miserable. And just now, the wife made veiled, childish status update about splitting up.

So this woman 1. Married a man she didn't like, 2. Blamed him for not being someone she likes, even though she knew it going into the marriage and lied to him to make it happen anyway, 3. Made his life miserable, and 4. Now has two kids who will grow up in a broken home, and all because she NEEDED to have babies. I'm not sure she even cared who she had them with. I'm so furious with her, but she's not a close enough friend to even bother lecturing.

It makes me so mad/sad that people end up in shitty marriages, or end up staying in relationships that never should have lasted, because they want or had kids. I'm in my mid-30s, and I'm not married. The reason I'm not married is because I haven't met the right person yet. I'm totally fine with that, because I have no time limit pressuring me to marry SOMEONE, ANYONE just so I can pop out a kid.

No, but really. In addition to my 16 year old cousin having just had a baby, my just-turned-18 year old cousin will be having one in May.

I get it.  Kids are gross.  They scream, they make messes, they poop and vomit and bleed everywhere, and one of the reasons I'm not going to procreate is so I don't have to experience it.

If one is a member of this subreddit, chances are it's because they've already decided not to have children, or are on the fence with a tendency toward childfreedom.  We do not need pictures of children in disgusting situations to reinforce the decision we've already made.

previously, she got free housing, free food, free bill payments AND a free university course that would have cost most people thousands of pounds.

Seriously? How is this even an argument! Of course I was a child once, we were all children once. How does invalidate the case for good parenting? 

I'm sure my parents were very aware I was a child and how uncontrollable children of a certain age are. That is the reason they did not take me to restaurants and other public gatherings until I understood the meaning of PARENTAL TERROR. That's when parents give you ""the look"" and you know you are dead meat when you get home. 

I still remember (its burned into my brain) one of my first meals out, for some reason or another I was being careless and spilled my food on the table. My mother asked me to clean the food I'd spilled. I said no and started whining loudly. My father then death gripped my arm and walked out of the restaurant with me in tow, apologizing to everyone he saw. I sat in the car with my father in complete silence (no I did not get to finish my food and neither did my dad) while my mom and siblings finished their food. By the time we got home my proverbial life was flashing before my eyes. I knew I was in trouble. And yup, I got spanked, all my privileges revoked and worst of all my parents sat me down and said ""you have brought shame on us. That is one of the worst things a child can do."" From that time on all it took was one look to bring me and my siblings in line.

So yes, I was a child once and being a parent isn't an easy task (which is why I'm not signing up for it) but heck if you *choose* to be a parent, PARENT!

Here is a list I wish I had the balls to print out and hand out to bad parents. 

1. Finding Nemo at 3 PM. Great for kids. The Hobbit at 11 PM? Not for kids. 

2. Chili's at 7 PM? Sure bring your monster. Del Frisco's ($100 a person steakhouse) at 9PM? Leave your demon spawn at home. 

3. Sears at 2 PM on a Saturday? Bring it on. Victoria's Secret at 2 PM on a Saturday? Please...I'd like to find my sexy panties without your 9 year old son staring at me. 

4. Chuck-E- Cheese? Great for children. The Bar? Not so much. 

5. Outside the free child care room at my college graduation? No. Inside the free child care  full of toys, early childhood education majors itching to play with your kids, snacks, and crafts at my college graduation? Great choice. (like my toddler cousin gives two shits about my BS in Math when there are Thomas the Tank Engine toys)

6. Funeral at the funeral home? Eh, if they are too young to realize what the fuck is going on? NO. At the wake with family at Pa Pa's house? great! 

7. In the wedding party? Sure it sounds cute..but wait until little Timmy decides that's the time for cartwheels and to spout off every cuss word he knows. (Happened!) 

8. The toy aisle with a parent at Target? Yay new toys. Any aisle sans guardian?  Booooo

9. My decorated front porch on Halloween? I have the good candy! My yard on July 17th...Get off my lawn!

10. On a changing table in the restroom? Good, kids poop too. On the table at Chipotle? Please, ruin my burrito. 


Please feel free to add your own.

This woman with her crotchfruit strapped to her chest comes in, orders a water and a decaf soy iced chai latte (for those of you not in the know, an iced chai latte is one of the more time-consuming drinks to make, in the barista trade), tipped a quarter, said ""you're welcome!"" when the barista didn't thank her. Then she went over to a table and, right in front of everyone, changed the little crotchfruit's diaper RIGHT THERE.

I made a gagging noise, and the barista saw what I was reacting to. He said, ""Uh, ma'am? We have a changing table in the restroom!"" She rolled her eyes, no joke, and said ""Yes, but it's FILTHY in there."" She got all huffy when the barista came over with her latte and asked her to please never do that again. He pulled the table away from her, hosed it down with disinfectant, during which the woman was making huffy ""well I NEVER!"" noises. This dude, the barista, never lost his cool the whole time. He pushed the table back into place, put her drink on it, smiled and wished her a good day.

I've never seen anything like it. The lady gave me this all suffering look as her crotchfruit screamed its head off. I must have still had a horrified look on my face, because she said, ""when you have kids, you'll understand."" I moved to a different table without responding.

(no probs!) After removing all my parcels, cycling bags, and clothes I wanted to try on from the trolley, I half dragged my purchases to one of the stalls...where I bumped into a woman coming out of a stall with a trolley. I looked at the attendant with my ""da fuq?"" face and she said ""oh, that's a pram."" There was a school-aged child sitting in the basket of the trolley. The exact same kind of trolley I had been forced to leave outside the stalls. (On her way out, the mother banged against the wall, leaving a dent).

tl;dr a trolley is a pram when there is a child in it and the rules bend (yet again) for parents.

My family can be literally nutty sometimes. My parents only have one blood-related granddaughter, and she is one and a half. Today they called me and told me that Scamp, our family dog of ten years and a German Shepherd mix, had snapped at her for playing too roughly when he was laying down, I assume she meant 'rolling all over him' as I knew she did. 

Told my mother ""Oh, he's a dog, you really can't be letting a kid rough him up like that, his joints are probably going bad and he just wants to rest."" Mother simply replied with ""Well, if he snaps at her again, that'll be the last of it."" So fucking cold and heartless, I'd assume it's a bluff, but my parents are protective over her.

Let me just put it here how much I love that dog. He was my best friend during school, saw me graduate college, and saw me become successful. He's always been my friend but because of so much school, work, and apartment hopping I've never found any way to take him with me. He loves running and the outdoors, and I can't for the life of me keep him locked up for 3/4 of a day in a small apartment.

He's a damn fine dog. A protective dog. Guards the house, guards the farm. Loves every single second of his life, loves running in the field, loves chasing things. He's such a spoiled dog too. He knows that if the whole family is together, there's table scraps somewhere for him. He'll bark at whoever touches or hugs my mother, even though that woman would put him down. He's not allowed on the couches or chairs, but will sneak up on them during stormy nights when everyone is asleep. Dog has more personality in his left paw then some humans.

If it comes down to it, I'll find a place that lets tenants have pets. If they ever mention again putting him down because he's acting like the animal he is, and because they can't tell a fucking kid to stop pissing with the dog, then I'll drive to Ohio and take the dog back myself. Scamp's not my dog technically, but I'll steal him from them just to protect him. Good job putting a member of our family of ten years behind of some crotch-nugget. That dog has shown my family more love in his ten years than my family can ever hope to get out of this kid. It sickens me to know what lengths my parents would go through to protect some idiot spawn. 

If they go through with it without telling me, they had better prepare to lose a son in the process, because I will cut off all contact with them.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,1369724220.0,,,True,t3_1f6omt,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1f6omt/i_swear_to_the_gods_if_you_touch_that_fucking_dog/,

What career do you want? Better hurry up and take all these standardized tests. Better get good grades so you can go to college. What do you mean you don't know what college you want to go to? How the hell do you not know what your major will be? Are you completely irresponsible? Heaven forbid you change your major.

For the record, I'm still on the four-year-plan in my original major at a school I love, and I consider myself fortunate in that regard. I love my internship, and so far I can see myself in this career path (chemical engineering) farther on down the road. 

But apparently I'm not adult enough to know I don't want kids. I'm adult enough to drive, have a job, vote, buy guns, buy (and drink) ALL THE BOOZE, have a credit card, take out loans, get tried as an adult in a court of law, get my own housing, and get a full-on examination at the gyno (apparently it's regional policy to not require pap smears until age 21). 

I hated kids when I was kids, I'm strongly INTJ, I loathe being around my younger cousins and relatives, I like my quiet and chaos-free lifestyle. Sleep is good, and I like it. In fact, I got off a rather long and strenuous day at the plant a few days ago and promptly took a two and a half hour nap. It was pretty glorious. I couldn't do that with kids, and I *gasp* want to use the degree I'm putting a dickwad of money and effort toward earning. I can't guarantee I'll revolutionize my industry any more than I could guarantee my offspring would change the world. I have a hell of a lot more control over me, though.

Side note: don't preach to me about the sins of premarital sex and then ask me when I'm going to have kids when you know I'm nowhere near engaged.

All of the (blood-related) women in my family have had a kid before their 18th birthday, and all but one have more than three.

When visiting at Christmas, I was chatting with my family at the dining room table, playing with their kids, talking, eating, the like. It's not that I mind the kids of my family, there's enough mom's around to keep them in check and well-behaved. While I was there I witnessed my cousin, mother to a new-born and a six year old, feeding the new born and receiving at least 25 handmade necklaces from the six year old in about a two hour window. It's cute that she kept making necklaces and wanting her mom to wear them, but seriously, I would have been so annoyed.

Anyways, my cousin asked me to hold her newborn while she helped my grandmother with something. I did, not wanting to be rude, and looked down at that little face. Beautiful, sure. Adorable, certainly. But I realized in that moment, I don't ever want to be a mother. My SO and I were pretty sure we didn't want kids before that, but that was a defining moment for me.

Later, the baby was asleep and the TV was babysitting the other kids, and someone comment on how awkward I was holding the baby. I laughed it off, let it go, ect. They continued to talk about kids and how horrible her pregnancy was and how she had to use her gas money to buy her kids shoes and the cost of diapers now a days, and of course, they ask me when it was my turn. I said, with complete certainty: I don't want children. Awestruck, they just stared at me. My cousin tells me that it's the most amazing thing in the world, seconds after complaining about having no money, no time, no romance and no fun. 

I shrugged it off, and just kept silent when they told me I would change my mind when I was older. Inside, I was laughing.

The proudest moment? We left the chaos and my favorite (single, male, college graduate, has-a-great-job, well-off) cousin walked to my sister's with us. He said,
""I just realized you're the only woman in our family who doesn't have kids and if you decide to, you'll probably be the only one to be married and financially stable before you have them. You actually have a future. At least someone in our family has their head on straight.""

Keep the sex fun and intimate, express your love."" She said ""well, is there anything that I can do that can ensure me getting pregnant quicker?""

This came from a really nice co-worker that I'm great friends with. He's pretty traditional and conservative for a person who lives in San Francisco, so I could see why his reaction was so strong. We grapple back and forth (in a friendly manner) on the worth of marriage and other conservative rituals...


**Him:** What?! Why don't you want kids?

**Me:** Because I like free time and money.

**Him:** Wow…that was blunt. 

**Me:** Yes, because it's true. Kids are expensive and I like sleeping. 


**Him:** But what are you going to do when you're old and nobody is taking care of you? 

**Me:** Having kids doesn't guarantee someone takes care of you. Plus, think about this: most people in nursing homes DO have kids and they don't get frequent visits. Your kids will have their own lives to take care of when you're in a home. That's kind of depressing but that *is* real life.


*(After this, he continued discussing how one day, my spouse will die and all my friends will die too and I will be alone. He just wouldn't understand that having kids doesn't guarantee you any comfort when you are old and dying. I even called him out on using kids as social security, but he still didn't get it.)*


**Him:** But you're just a taker and not a giver into the world! If you have kids you can give so much more to the world than if you didn't. What's the meaning in life then? 
 
**Me:** Well, not really. First of all, having kids generates more garbage and waste so by not having kids, I'm not adding to that. Also, not having kids means I have time to volunteer or apply myself in things I could care about: academia, technology, medicine, etc. Those still benefit the world. I can have meaning in life without having children.
 
 
**Him:** But if you influence your kids, you can have a legacy and impact through them and their children and their children after that. That's so much impact on the world.
 
**Me:** That could be true, but it could also not be true. When you have kids, you have no idea how they turn out. They could cure cancer or they could become a murderer that kills the person that could've cured cancer. They could be a genius, they could have Down's Syndrome. It's kind of all up in the air. There's no guarantee of anything. However, I can apply MYSELF to things I care about, there will be a positive influence there because I am MYSELF, I can control my own destiny and I can make it happen. 
 
 
*(This segued into a conversation about how it's a societal norm to have kids and how that negatively impacts the children of parents that didn't want them or shouldn't be parents…but were pressured by society to do so. He started giving in a bit here.)*


It was an interesting conversation. I am surprised at how my first negative reaction was from a person roughly around my age. I've always expected an older parent to be the first to tell me I was wrong. I was also pleasantly surprised by the other two co-workers in on our discussion (both also around my age); they both want families but were totally on my side when it came to being CF. One even went so far to say that not having kids would guarantee positive impact on the world more than kids and that sometimes he wished that he didn't want a family so he could have time to go out and pursue other things. 


**Summary/TL;DR:** Coworker is mortified that I don't want kids. It was just kind of amazing how this forum gave me good ways to respond to each ""reason"" he gave me for having kids. I've only been on the subreddit for a couple months, but you guys have given really great arguments that I've just started to absorb and use as my own. Thanks CF and keep it up!

I joined this subreddit because I have been CF for 28 years and am happy to finally see that my life choice is shared by others and I am FINALLY accepted somewhere. I am judged by society on all fronts and I don't want that kind of judgement here. Sadly, this is no longer the case.

I personally haven't seen evidence of CF'ers going to /r/parenting for the sole purpose of trolling. The double standard is annoying and unfair.

If the mods are reading this, please, please start banning people and/or deleting comments that are definitely against redditiquette. Whatever. 

I've read from other users that there are no active mods here. How can we remedy this? How can we make this our own happy place again? 

EDIT: I'm aware that not every hater is from r/parenting, and likely from random reddit, but they certainly don't like us over there, let's be honest... Once a CF person is discovered in their midst, it's like WW III... And then the downvoting begins. I'm not saying there is a full on subreddit war, but I'd like to prevent that as I've personally seen this kind of thing completely destroy other subreddits.  

EDIT 2: Thanks for such great responses! Looks like a few mods have been added! I cannot wait to see where this subreddit will go! I loved the idea of an FAQ!

The speaker brought up that although so many people have kids because they want ""unconditional love"", the sad reality is that children aren't even capable of providing it.  Love originates from the limbic system of the brain, which isn't developed until the teen years.  This makes sense because that is when we are having our first romantic relationships.  The speaker said that children are neurologically programed to selfishly seek their needs, not dispense love to their parents.  The audience actually laughed during this.

I rolled my eyes and said ""I am so glad I don't have kids"" where everyone could see it and made it point to show how appalled I was by her child's behavior. I went to my appointment and forgot about.


After my appointment I went to the pharmacy and saw her by the bathrooms. She made eye contact with me and apologized for her son's behavior. Then she told me that he suffers from pyschatric problems and can be hard to control. I instantly felt like shit. I murmured a small apology and turned away in shame. 


Then she came over and sat down with her whole brood to wait for her scripts to be filled. After a few anxious minutes, I went over and apologized properly. I said I reacted poorly in that situation and I should have not acted disgusted at her special needs child. I was the one in the wrong in that situation. She took it well and said that she gets so many people who act like that towards her son that didn't even phase her anymore. This does not make my behavior okay in anyway, though and I will be more courteous around exhausted parents from now on.

My aunt is one of my favorite people in the world. She and my uncle are well-off and live life luxuriously; they have a passion for travel, people, and food that is inspiring. My uncle is British, so they live in England. My aunt, though her accent is American, has the ""proper British"" attitude. Not stuffy, just... polite, respectful, reserved, and well-spoken.

When my siblings and I were younger, they wouldn't visit my family (this was my dad's sister) that often, but when they did, they would almost exclusively spend time with my parents. Which was fine by my siblings and me, because we didn't get along well with them. Not saying we disliked them, but we didn't really ""get"" them.

When I was 17, my father passed away; and soon after, that awesome uncle was diagnosed with cancer. In a fret, and recently faced with the impacts of mortality, my mom flew all of us out to visit them.

For the first time, I saw my aunt and uncle for who they were: incredible individuals. We had an amazing trip with them, and really got to know them. Every couple years after that, we would visit again, and every trip -- and every connection with them -- was better than the last. I cherish those visits as highlights of my life so far, and I could tell they felt the same about us.

One evening (I think I was mid-20s at this point), over a few rounds of drinks, stories, and laughter, my aunt looked at me fondly and declared, ""You know, as strange as this sounds... our shared tragedy brought us together. I really know all of you as *people* now, and I'm so happy for it."" I was grinning, and said the same back to her. I commented that being adults -- and meeting each other again as equals -- changed everything. She wholeheartedly agreed.

Then, struck by a suspicion, I suddenly asked her, ""Why didn't you and [uncle] ever want kids?"", knowing their childfree status was by choice.

She thought about it for a moment, took a sip of her nice wine, and looked around her elegant living room, decorated with delicate commererables from their travels. With dry British humor, she nonchalantly replied, ""I wanted a white couch.""

I cracked up laughing. I instantly knew the deeper meaning to her words -- her priorities were on nice things and nice experiences, and living life as fully as she could, by her own terms -- but her phrasing was perfect.

I've since used that exact quote when people ask me the same thing. It doesn't matter that I don't have a white couch; people either get it, or they don't.

We constantly are told by parents (both our own and other people's) that we won't know what real love is until we have kids. 

I made a reply to a topic in /r/harrypotter about the ending and how I was dissatisfied with the underwhelming conclusion. Throughout the whole series Hermione is made out to be this prodigy, 'the brightest witch of her time' and I was led to expect a dazzling future from her. The books end, however, with her shacked up with Ron, kids in tow, with a few accomplishments like working for equal rights of magical creatures and improved relations between muggles and wizards, but nothing lofty or as monumental as I'd hoped. 

One woman in particular became pretty outraged by my comment, insinuating that I was just an angry feminist who resented her choice to be a mom or something, which was not the case. I do, however, feel that the character was capable of much more. This was met with a volley of angry mothers saying how wrong it was of me to belittle motherhood as a choice.

How is it wrong of me to say a brilliant character was capable of greater things than just pushing out Ron's crotch fruit, but it's ok for them to tell us we don't know what love is and parenthood is the apex of your life, and children your greatest achievement? 

I'm not sure if I explained this correctly, but it feels like they're allowed to criticise our choices all they want but the moment we have a dissenting opinion, were terrible people and our opinions are wrong.

TL;DR: parents can tell us we don't know love and we're selfish and it's ok, but we're not allowed to comment on their choices at all.

I love my job and my coworkers, and I'm very nicely compensated. It's a great deal all around.

Yesterday, it was going smoothly, like any other day. Lots of moms and dads with their kids, none of them out of control or noisy, only one fussy baby but she was totally cool and just wanted some hugs from mom. THEN IT HAPPENED.

A woman came up with a toddler in the little baby-seat part of the shopping cart. The kid was munching on a snack, so she handed it to me to scan and I gave it back to the kid, who was cool as a cucumber, just chilling with his snack. Say ""here you do buddy."" and continue to bag her groceries. 

I was trying to focus on entering all the codes for the fruits and veggies she was purchasing (most don't have bar codes), so I wasn't really paying attention to either of them. Out of nowhere, she hisses at me ""*He's waving at you, can you not even wave back to my son???*"" I looked up, confused, and gave him a high five. I went back to ringing up all her food. 

A few seconds later, she LOUDLY says to the other woman with her (who looks totally embarrassed already) **""I WOULD LOVE TO PLAY WITH KIDS WHILE I WAS AT WORK. DOESN'T SEEM LIKE SHE'S INTERESTED IN THEM, MAYBE SHE'S BARREN.""**

EXCUSE ME BITCH?! I look up at her and say ""I'm sorry, should I not be focused on ringing up *your* groceries right now? Would you like to do it yourself?"" Okay, honestly I said it with a bit of sass, but it's not like I was swearing at her or getting angry. She asked to speak to my manager. 

My manager came over and they spoke, I couldn't hear them since they sat at a table and I was STILL ringing all this shit in, but her friend was totally red in the face and apologized over and over and even went to far as to call the woman ""a moody bitch"" since she's gotten pregnant again. 

The transaction ended with me (with my manager at my side) informing her that we don't take checks, which she was trying to write. She started screaming at us while swiping her credit card about how we discriminate against working mothers (what??), hate parents and children, aren't taking the check because she's black (WHAT???), basically anything that popped into her head. Her son starts crying and she's still swearing as they leave the store.

",throwaway_cf,243,34,61,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/zn15r/i_went_to_a_party_last_night_wtf_were_these/,"Throw away because people at the party are on reddit and know my username. 

So my SO and I are CF and plan on staying that way. We heard about a local reddit meetup party going on in our city and decided to go. We'd never met any of these people before and we don't know many people as we're in a new city. We thought ""Great! A way to meet some cool people"". So we went. 

Now, a little backstory, I had incredibly shitty parents growing up. Although I identify as an atheist, I always say there is a special place in hell for bad parents. I hate bad parents. I go right back to that little kid who was wondering when dad was coming home from the bar and if he would hit me that day. 

Anyway, so we walk into this party and I see two small children playing on the floor right by the beer pong table. I was immediately horrified. I was even more horrified when I discovered the owner of the house was dad to the younger girl. This guy knew he would have his daughter for the weekend and decided to have a party where random people he'd never met before would be drinking and interacting with his 3 year old.  

Kids naturally gravitate to me. I have no idea why they do it, but when I walk in the kids flock. Both of these little girls ran up to me, started talking, and asking me to play. I humored them for a little while and played and listened and then thought ""where in the fuck are your parents?!"" My SO was walking around, saw that I was visibly distressed at all the child attention I was receiving and stepped in. He went to get the dad of the younger girl. He pampers were wet, she'd fallen down and bumped her head, and she was dirty. 

So dbag dad sees that I'm up to my eye balls in his kid and says to my SO ""Let her deal with it. Thats what women are for"". He promptly says I don't fucking think so or something to that effect and dad leads her away. Well he starts ignoring her immediately afterwards and she runs back to me again. 

Now, I don't mind children if they are well behaved, and this kid was sweet. So I quit fighting it and figured as long as I'm here I can bring a little bit of joy into this child's life considering her dad was such an incredible asshole. So I spent the night hanging out with this sweet little girl and talked to new people in between my dealings with her. 

Towards the end of the night I heard him say ""The kid goes back to her moms in the morning. I can't fucking wait"". And when I tried to compliment him on having a sweet, well behaved daughter all he said was ""thanks"" and went back to talkin about video games. 

Fuck you asshole. You don't deserve to procreate. Its people like you that made me not want to have children. 

TL;DR I went to a party, spent my night hanging out with a kid, dad was a fucking asshole.  ",,False,,t5_2qtwb,False,,,True,t3_zn15r,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/zn15r/i_went_to_a_party_last_night_wtf_were_these/,

My body ballooned up again and I felt like I was starving. That was how I always felt before, it wasn't just an initial side effect.
When I googled the birth control, I read about people with similar side effects. I read that the hormones can cause some women to gain real weight, not just water weight, because it can cause your body to process food differently and store fat.

To say I was mortified and angry is an understatement. I thought of all the doctors that laughed in my face when I said I wanted my tubes tied. I thought of how they reacted when I explained how I felt so awful all the time, that I just needed to eat better and exercise. I have been put on all kinds of anti depressants and mood stabilizers over the years, with nothing but detrimenal effects. 

I was in tears and so terribly angry. When looking up tubal ligation, I sifted through so much crap to find other people who had it done at my age without already having had children. So many lies about what it does to your body. I came across the term ""child free"" for the first time. I decided I was going to make an apointment with my Dr and take the 1st step to actively pursue sterilization.

As I was reading about this, my husand was on his computer next to me and clicked on a reddit link ""what 2 sub reddits would you like to see battle it out"" or something of that nature. The top comment was ""parenting vs child free"". That is how I discovered this sub reddit. 
 
I was amazed by this coincidence and feel compelled to share my story.

I am so afraid that it will be another heartbreaking experience when I talk to my doctor. I just don't want to go through it over and over again, where I am laughed at or not taken seriously. I hope I can keep my emotions in check and not just start crying as soon as I see my doctor. The range of hurt and anger is so broad and intense. 

TL;DR: I am 26, F, married, childless, in Kansas City. I want my tubes tied. I am bringing it up to my dr for the 1st time on Monday. What is the best way to discuss this, how do I keep my anger and hurt about the past at bay?",,False,,t5_2qtwb,False,,,True,t3_1b98gu,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1b98gu/yesterday_i_learned_the_term_child_free/,

(Warning: Rant Inside),BEZthePEZ,256,53,128,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/1a27c9/all_of_my_rage_warning_rant_inside/,"So I'm 19, Male and decided early on I could never have children. For several reasons, but mainly because I fucking hate those things and because I'd like to have a life, thank you. Well today I was working as a PA (production assistant) on a small film shoot. Well, then send me off to get coffee right? So I'm at Dunkin Donuts, and some mom with her kid is in front of me. At first the kid seems chill, but then *demands* the iPhone 5 from her mother. She starts playing some random game with full volume and yelling ""Ha!"" ""Eat it!"" and a whole bunch of other shit. The mother then has to make a call, and takes away the iPhone. Guess what the little cumsprout did? 

*""WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!""*  

For a solid fucking minute, and the lady just ignores it! Then she gets off the phone, gives it back to the annoying little fucknut and gets her 1/2 dozen of donuts. I sigh, order my ""box o joe"" and wait there. What I failed to notice was the little brat apparently ate about 4 of these donuts and wasnt feeling to well. She decides to walk up to me and tug on my jeans. Now I hate children, but I'm not gonna openly yell at one, so I ask, ""Sup?"" She replies with ""I don't feel well"". I then say, ""huh. go tell your mother"" She then says ""no"" and then 

***FUCKING PUKES ON MY FUCKING JEANS***

I jump back after its gone all over my legs and shirt. The mother comes over, ushering her brat away from me while I'm desperately trying to get this shit off of my jeans and shit. I didnt bring replacements.

""I'm so sorry! I thought she could handle her donuts!"" said the mother.

I replied with ""Yeah, well she didn't. Look, whatever, just get out. I really don't want to talk to you, given your little brat just puked all over me.""

She got that 'ole 'I'm a parent and thus you cannot judge me' look and said ""Excuse me? Did you just call my baby girl a brat? She's just a kid!""

Fuck that. ""I don't care, She still puked all over me. Please just leave with your kid before I get upset. I'm trying to remain calm, but you defend that little monster isn't helping.""

The mother gets upset, yells some more, and then leaves. As she's leaving, she tells me ""You'll have kids of your own one day! You'll have to deal with this too!""

***NO I WONT***

***GO FUCK YOURSELF***

***THATS NOT A GOOD EXCUSE***

***GOD FUCKING DAMMIT***

For the rest of the day, I smelled like kid puke and got the nick-name ""pukepants"".

When I see most of you posting, you're talking about your busy, active lives, your studies, your work goals, your volunteer efforts, etc. 

Some of you are in masters or graduate programs, and many of you are younger than me. Not all of you of course, I seem to be at the middle of the age range of many of the folks here.

Then there's me. I'm just sort of...floating along, aimless and making decisions about my life at literally the flip of a coin sometimes. (not joking, I did an expiriment one week where I made all my major decisons based on coin flips.) I'm working what is most likely a dead end job, and not even a paticularly interesting, challenging or high paying job, but I am happy with it! 

In fact I don't think I would be happy in a more demanding job. Too much work. 

I'm also college drop out. I hated every minute of college and never have any intention of going back. The work and cost involved does not appeal to me. The work involved with filling out FAFSA paperwork appeals even less to me. 

I'd probably make more money at work if I had a minimum of a bachelors, but EHHHH more money usually means a more mentally demanding job, and I just want to work 9-5, collect my paycheck and go home and watch Netflix, or game with my SO, or go hang out with my friends.

I'm overweight too. I see people talking about how great it is to have an 'unruined' body, when mine looks like I probably crapped out at least three kids, stretchmarks on the stomach and all. I yo-yo up and down in weight depending on how happy or depressed I am.

I don't do volunteer work either. I'm not an activist of any kind and sometimes I kinda feel like I'm wrong for that somehow.

Yet, here I am. I'm still childfree.

I don't think I am a unique little snowflake by any means, (honestly, I think I'm as 'average human being' as one can get) but as with most of my areas in life, I realized that I never quite fit the description of my peers.",,False,,t5_2qtwb,False,,,True,t3_19bte9,http://www.reddit.com/r/childfree/comments/19bte9/any_other_unconventional_cfers/,

We had talked about the possibility of having children, but that changed once we saw how life altering it was for his brother &amp; wife.  We were steadfast on the idea of not having children, until we moved.  For 3 years after a vacation to the pacific northwest all my husband could talk about was moving there.  And so, we made all the arrangements to make it happen.  We had only been in Seattle for 3 months before he began talking about wanting children.  I told him that I still didn't want to have children, but that could change if he were able to break past his depression.  He's been seeing a therapist for 3 months now.  During this time he's grown more distant from me and ignores me.  His miserable because he wants a baby so badly.  But to provide more information this man can't even take the garbage out, cook dinner, pay bills and complains when things don't go his way.  He believes his whole life would change when he has a baby.  He stated I'm an amazing wife and person, but that he doesn't want to live his life in regret because he didn't have a child.  I'm dumbfounded that he would choose a non-existant person over the woman he's been in a relationship for the last 9 years.  
**UPDATE:  husband packed all things up over last weekend, left all the furniture here, told me I could have the money and was gone.  he's apparently staying with a ""friend"" about 70 miles away.  I cancelled the insurance, bank accounts, cable and his phone is next, only thing is that I requested for him to provide me with a new cell number and he hasn't, he's also driving around with no car insurance.  and today I find out that he went to another state with a girl to shoot machine guns, while he should be at work.  (no lie)  WTF?!?!?!** 

**UPDATE:  after many conversations, the husband has now gone back and forth on whether or not he wants to work on the marriage.  I shared with him what my environment needed to look like in order to have children.  (They are fairly simple requests, although unattainable to him at this point).  First he said he was going to ride it out in Washington, next he stated he was going home to his mom in Illinois, and then back to staying in Washington.  I also shared with him that I was looking at apartments and he was happy for me to move on with my life.  But then after a few days and reality set in, he wasn't as thrilled.  A conversation we had the day I was going to sign my lease was that he wanted to work on the marriage and fix things between us.  When I told him I signed the lease, he asked was it big enough for 2 people.  He told me the woman he is living with is making him uncomfortable because she's attracted to him.  I said I need for you and I to be on our own for a while, to discover our true needs, uncover our capabilities to take care of ourselves, and work on the marriage with a real effort.  He did not take to the message well.  He was upset that I would not allow for him to live with me.  He thinks its impossible for us to fix the marriage if we don't live together.  He also has discovered that he will have a very hard time living on his own financially.  I'm foolish, I still love this man.  I just need for him to get better.  Work on his happiness.  I want to give him a shot at having the happiness he desires.  In the same token, I need to take care of me.

Long story short; I got a vasectomy a year ago and it is AWESOME! My partner and I are super happy about it but we've thought of a way to make it even better (aside from the carefree sex).

Every year on the date of my surgery we are now celebrating ""No Baby Day"", in which we use a silly amount of money to buy/do something stupid and frivolous that we would not be able to if we had children.

For parents, it seems to go like this:

Can I buy that expensive coat I like? Nope, little Timmy needs diapers.

I wonder if we can go to that fancy hotel for the weekend? Nope, Little Jenny wants to use the car.

Do you want to go on a trip today up North (I'm Canadian, this makes sense to us)? Nope, can't find a baby sitter in time.

But for us, after the question will always be ""YES!""*

For any of you out there that have been sterilized, or have even just committed to not having children, take a day and spoil yourself! 

Alternatively, even if you're not 100% on not having kids (although I'm sure I'm speaking to the wrong crowd), this is a good way to realize some of the things you'd have to give up if you decided to be a breeder.

tl;dr Had a vasectomy, celebrate the date every year with stupid crap I would have otherwise had to forgo in lieu of paying for kid expenses.

As a student, I used to work at a ZARA store in Vienna (Austria). One day (I was just folding shirts as usual) a woman approaches me. Her son, who was probably 4 to 5 years old, was doing the ""pee dance"" right beside her. So she asked me (and this is a translation, I'm German): 
""My son needs to go to the bathroom - what can you offer me?"". The wording itself sounded very strange to me, but ok, I tried my best to give her an appropriate answer. So I said: ""Unfortunately we don't have bathrooms for customers, but there's a public toilet right outside of the store and there's also a McDonalds right across the street."" 

Then, completely out of the blue, she went totally haywire: ""NOOO!"" she shouted at me ""THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE, IT’S TOO FAR AWAY!!! MY SON NEEDS TO PEE NOW!!! SO WHAT ELSE CAN YOU OFFER ME??!!??"". 

I was totally shocked because I didn't anticipate such a strong reaction, but I tried to explain to her: ""Ma'm, the bathrooms for our employees are in the storage area - and there are a lot of clothes without security marks on them, so we cannot let customers use these bathrooms - I'm very sorry."" 

Her head turned red and little ""Fritz'"" pee dance became more expressive with every second passing. 

She then literally started screaming: ""IF YOU DON'T LET US USE YOUR BATHROOM, MY SON WILL PEE ON YOUR FLOOR!!!"" (Just imagine the other customer's heads turning...) 
I tried to calm her down and said: ""Ma'm, I'm so sorry - would you like me to show you the public bathrooms outside? I could take you there - they're only 15 meters away from the store."" 
But instead of accepting the offer, she kept on yelling: ""This is the worst customer service I've ever had - I will get you fired! You are a horrible person! Get me the manager!!"". 

I was baffled. 

Fortunately our store manager (a very impressing 5ft10 Slovakian woman) overheard the whole conversation. She stepped up to the woman, looked down on her, and told her to leave the store immediately - and never speak to one of her employees like that again. 

Mother and child left - I never saw them again and I really hope, the kid peed himself so that cunt of a mother had to clean it up. 
I was very thankful about how my boss reacted - she was/is a really great lady. 

And now to the rant: I totally understand that kids don't schedule their need to pee - but why on earth would you go to a clothing store to ask for a bathroom, when there's a perfectly clean public bathroom (Vienna is a VERY clean city) AND a McDonalds only a few meters away? Why the fuck would you scream at an employee who had given you a perfectly reasonable answer to why you could not use the bathroom at this particular store. Why would you keep your child suffering, just to end up being right and why the hell do you want to get someone fired over your son's urge to pee?!?

I'm 23 and almost 7 weeks pregnant by a guy I briefly dated before graduating college. I'm about to move across the country get another degree and I found out I'm pregnant while traveling in South America.

I'm electing to have an abortion because I'm single and simply can't handle going through a pregnancy, much less raise a child. I think I'm a child myself. I've never wanted children, ever, ever, and I'm a subscriber to this sub on my normal account.

But at the same time I can't legitimize it in my head. The papers are signed and everything's paid for, but I feel like I'm old enough to have known better and almost owe it to the world to go through with the pregnancy and just give it up for adoption. I almost feel like I simply have to face the music and do the 'right' thing, and that this abortion is simply for selfish reasons. I'm having an abortion because I don't want to be pregnant and I do not want a child.

But I AM pregnant, and I found out today it already has a heartbeat. Basically, I feel horrible, and I can't stop crying every 30 minutes. The pre-op days at the Gyno were so difficult. My parents have been amazing and absolutely supportive, but it's just not enough. 


***UPDATE:*** 

I had my procedure done earlier today, and I'm just relaxing and recovering. My undercarriage is a bit sore, I cramped for awhile but I have some pain meds (pretty much prescription strength advil), and a bit of light bleeding. 

The whole thing was sad, and the worst part was in the paperwork beforehand, I had to sign a form to allow the hospital to deal with the remains of the baby. I would say that was the most difficult part.

I had the procedure done as an outpatient at a hospital and the surgery was performed by my gyno. Although it was a bit more expensive, it was very private and I was able to be anesthetized (IV, I was breathing on my own). My mom came with me, saw me off to the OR, and met me in a recovery room where I was able to sort of wake up. The rest of the day I spent watching movies, eating junk food, and napping on and off.

I couldn't really check this post after I made it; I wasn't really ready to see the answers. But I've read through most of them and holy crap I cannot believe the amount of love and encouragement I have received. I was lucky enough to not check until the rude comments were deleted, so I missed a good part of those and didn't see them. I've still received a few PM's saying 'don't kill the baby, you'll regret it forever' etc. but I guess that's part of the charm of reddit.

Regardless, thank you so much to those of you who have shared your stories, and thank you so so so much to those of you who encouraged me and sent me love.

I have a therapy appointment later this week, and the inner peace will settle in.

""Your lack of action says a lot about your lack of character and integrity. You know what, I take back what I said before. I'm glad you've decided to get yourself fixed. Children need parents who are selfless and take their responsibilities seriously. Like you said, you couldn't handle it. In fact, I don't think that you've managed any adult, real life challange without a drug or a shrink to blow hot air to. Your decision had nothing to do with my husband. You just can't handle people who have standards and values and actually keep them. In the last four years, you have done nothing but lower your standards, run away from anything that reminds you of your father, and anything that makes you think of guilt because we all know that you can't handle that. You can't be held to any standard that requires you to exert self control because you have none. So go on and enjoy your hedonistic life. You know exactly where you're headed.""

(Just for context, she's Catholic and I'm ex-catholic/atheist. When we met, I was still in the Church, but left a few years into our friendship. She was always trying to get me back, always pressuring me to marry and have kids like her. Her husband is a complete bigot and I've been trying to politely end the friendship since she got married 4 years ago.

Also, I had a rough time in college. I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for years. So apparently she views treating depression with pills and counseling as a personal flaw. Seriously, what the fuck? I can't tell you how much this hurts me, considering how 'supportive' she was at the time I was in therapy.)

EDIT: Thanks for the support, everyone! I definitely needed some love, and I found it here :)

For the record. I replied with an emphatic 'NEVER contact me again'.

Hi everyone, 

Just wanted to let people who were curious know what happened in regards to my upstairs neighbour's screaming baby.

This past Wednesday as I was walking into the building, the Super called me over to her office.  During the summer, when the couple refused to close the window when the baby cried at night after I asked them to do so, I mentioned it to her.  She asked if I was still having problems with the baby crying and I told her the truth.  The situation had gotten worse, the baby wasn't just crying anymore but screaming for over an hour at at time.  When I said I was going to go talk with them, she told me not to bother.

She told me this:  all the nieghbours on that floor signed a complaint against the couple for noise and other nuisances with the building management company.  I was then told exactly how damn clueless this couple was.  

I had forgotten, as it's been 10 years, there IS a clause in the rental agreement that states the tenant is responsible for sound proofing via drapes, area rugs, etc.  The Super had to go inspect the apartment and found no effort had been made.  Also, the baby had been installed in what could be called the master bedroom which shares a wall with another apartment, rather than the smaller, interior bedroom.  The couple decided to do this so they wouldn't *wake the baby when watching TV* (but waking their next door neighbour at 3am seemed completely fine with them!) Also, the couple were keeping their monstrous baby stroller in the hallway which people were fed up with squeezing around, tripping over and since it was blocking the hall, being a fire hazard.  Finally, the couple - who are using a diaper service - decided the best place for the dirty diaper pail was in the hallway, in the tiny alcove of the garbage chute.  So the entire floor got to smell the filthy diapers.  How gross is that?
The couple were given until the end of the month to do something or could be evicted Dec. 1st.  

So this weekend, I heard much activity going on upstairs, furniture moving, some hammering etc.  As of Saturday night, I've heard nary a peep from up there.   Yay!  I get to sleep again. 

Final note:  The baby is perfectly healthy.  She doesn't have an ear infection or colic.  She just has quite the temper for a little one and goes from crying to shrieking very quickly.

Other than my mother and my SO I have no one I can tell about this without being chastised. It feels even better than I imagined and the finality of it is such a relief.

Look, when I was that age, I understood what privacy was, and if she isn't going to teach him about it, I was damn well going to do it for her.

   For some context - I traveled back to my hometown to see my mother for mother's day.  She recently remarried a man who has three daughters.  My mom's mother and father were present and we ate dinner together.

   Literally the ENTIRE dinner the only topic of discussion was why I did not want to have kids.  After trying to change the subject unsuccessfully I pulled out the usual financial issues, that I didn't want to risk my dreams of traveling, that the woman I am with does not want children either, that our family has a history of terrible fathers, that my life path will leave me little time for children, etc.  After I have explained all of this as politely as I could (and it was mother's day so I pulled out all the politeness I could muster) my mother looks straight at me and says - ""If you don't have children you will break my heart.""  My grandmother hastily agrees and says that I am being selfish, and that her heart would break as well.  My sister then pipes up and tells me that she would barely be able to take it, and that I would wind up as the ""crazy uncle"" to her kids.  My grandmother then asked me who gave me the right to make that decision for myself.  I was close to snapping at this point but with a straight face I pointed to myself and said ""I do.""  She scoffed and continued to besmirch couples that chose to not have children.

   This is a level of selfishness that I cannot fathom.  This is my own family and to have them not respect my decision is heartbreaking and cruel.

   I hope this is the place for this rant, and I am curious as to if any of you have similar experiences with family as well, and how to deal with it.

They stopped on the sidewalk not far from me, and I could hear the distraught mother talking with her husband.  She angrily said something along the lines of:
“He is making me insane!  I cannot make him listen! He keeps wanted to go back there!  He won’t do what I tell him! You have to do something to make him mind or I am going to lose MY mind!”

I looked at the crying boy, struggling to get away from the vice-like grip of his mother.  Then I looked to Tessie, no leash, and viewing the scene with interest.

I'm a female, 32. I have one other sister, who's 40. Neither of us are going to have children. She absolutely hates them and I'm just not interested. I travel numerous times a year, work late, still go drinking with friends on weekends, enjoy brunch and treat myself. None of this is conducive to being a mother. 

The person I feel for most is my own mother. Her sister (my aunt) has five grandchildren, her most recent being twins who are about six months old. She is constantly sending my mother pictures, and my mother forwards them to me as if I don't see them on Facebook every day. She's pretty much stopped nagging either of us because she knows it's not going to happen, but I think the reality setting in has made her depressed. She's retired, doesn't have any friends and I think it was the one thing she had to look forward to in her old age. She pretty much worships her two cats and they are the highlight of her life, much to the annoyance of my father who, at 61, is still working his life away.

It doesn't make sense for me to have a child (ruin my life) to please her, but I wonder how many women give in to this. Does anybody else have parents who will never have grandchildren?

I have two boys,and I love them. I wouldn't trade them for anything, but if I could go back I probably wouldn't have chosen to have kids."" 

We chatted about that some more. Her main reason for regret lay in the feeling that she was pressured by her culture into marriage and having kids. She felt like everyone glossed over or flat out lied to her about how difficult it could be. Now she's a single mom and she never expected she'd be doing it all on her own. She told me ""If you have kids, you have to be willing to take on all the responsibilities yourself. No one told me that."" 

It was just such an unexpected conversation to my least favorite question. I feel so bad for her, and so very relieved that I am not going to be taking those same risks. A lot of young women don't even seem to realize those risks exist and it's just so sad.

What do the parents do? Nothing. Not a word.

What do I do? Pass out the rest of the plates and walk the fuck away.
