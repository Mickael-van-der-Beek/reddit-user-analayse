1362666906.0,73,self.ECE,19ugn3,There's a lot of current EE/ECE students here and I'd like to share a surprising tip that will help you later in your careers.,bouldernuggets,94,21,72,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/19ugn3/theres_a_lot_of_current_eeece_students_here_and/,"I graduated 5 years ago and have been working in the field ever since and I occasionally see questions on here from students asking about preparing for jobs once they graduate, what classes will help them the most and what topics to know before entering the job market. But these are all asking about engineering topics specifically and what I don't see many comments on is how to be a truly well-rounded engineer.

What I mean by well-rounded isn't merely referring to knowing a lot of topics within EE/ECE but actually knowing things that *aren't* EE/ECE. The school I went to had mandatory humanities and upper level humanities requirements to get your degree and 95% of my fellow students always went for the super easy (and therefore useless) classes so that they could focus more on their engineering coursework. I believe this is not only a mistake but also a waste of tuition considering you aren't really gaining anything intellectually speaking from that entire easy A class if you are taking it for the specific purpose of not having to do any work in it and so you can spend more time on engineering courses.

As an example of how this effects your career later in life, I can't count the number of times when I was still in school and even after entering the job market that I have read lab reports or generally any written documents that have atrocious grammar, are difficult to read, poorly written, and as a result fail to thoroughly convey ideas or concepts to the reader. Now I know they have ""Writing for Engineers"" or ""Technical Writing"" classes that may even throw in a creative writing assignment but these usually fall very short and I know the one I had to take was poorly executed and most of the engineering students treated it like another one of those easy A courses that they didn't have to care about.

So what was my solution when I was in school and what I am recommending to all the students here? Don't BS your way through your humanities requirements and throw away your tuition money on those easy A humanities classes. While all your fellow students are taking History of Jazz (this was my school's upper level easy A class, not sure if it still is) or some other well-known skate-through class you should be looking at humanities classes that will actually help you be a more well-rounded person and engineer. At the school I went to they have a program called Humanities For Engineers which sounds a bit ridiculous if you think about it but these were actually some of my favorite classes to take.  

Even if your school doesn't have something like this you can still find non-engineering classes that satisfy your humanities credit requirements and will actually give you valuable education that will supplement your engineering knowledge. Find some courses that seem interesting to you that you might remotely enjoy and try them. Don't worry yourself with how much time they might take away from your engineering work, in most cases a lot of the work for these classes is reading and writing (as it should be) and it will be a welcome break from crunching numbers and formulas. 

The reading and writing you will do in this classes is exactly what will make you a more valuable engineer in the future. I work at a smaller company but when any protocol documents need to be written or anything needs to be conveyed on paper or in presentation I am the primary one responsible for working on them. This is entirely due to spending my humanities tuition on courses that actually challenged my intellect and made me think about things other than engineering. I took classes on how society and technology interact and wrote my final paper on the subject of transhumanism, or classes on dystopias/utopias where I got to read some fantastic books, or even my lower division philosophy of science class where I learned about Bayes theorem, falsification of scientific ideas, and even the Alvarez Hypothesis on the mass extinction of the dinosaurs. My final paper in that class was why intelligent design should not be allowed in schools.

**TL;DR:** Don't waste your tuition and time on the easy A non-engineering classes. Instead take *real* humanities classes that challenge you and inherently make you a more well-rounded engineer who will be a far greater asset to future employers than most of your fellow students. I personally see investing in this aspect of your education and not blowing it off like most engineering students to be on the same level (but not the same scale) as getting a minor degree or getting an MBA or something similar to supplement your actual degree. It really does add another dimension to your capabilities as an engineer and makes you a more valued employee at whichever company you end up with.",,False,,t5_2r2sg,False,,,True,t3_19ugn3,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/19ugn3/theres_a_lot_of_current_eeece_students_here_and/,

I've been playing around with a Stellaris Launchpad EK for a few months now, and just recently released a big update to my frequency analyzer project.  I think it's pretty cool... I made a custom PCB for the audio capture portion and am using a booster pack Kentec made for displaying the frequency data (320 x 240 pixels, 16 bit color).

The DSP parameters are all configurable at runtime; sampling frequency, minimum display frequency, maximum display frequency, and number of display elements.  I even got to add in a ""falling maximum"" rain type effect, which was pretty fun :)

Oh, and full disclosure: I am a Texas Instruments employee.  This project was developed fully in my free time though, and my real job has nothing to do with the Launchpad platform.

I had pretty good grades and I was able to get my first job right away working as a control systems engineer with a small manufacturing company. After 2 months of trying my best to like it, I have come to the conclusion that it is just not for me.

My job title is “Electrical Engineer”, but so far, about 50% or more of my work has been wiring/refurbishing PLC panels. I don’t mind terminating a few wires here and there, but doing it for 8 hours in a hot/dirty machine shop is not what I thought I was getting into when I was solving complex math problems for 4 years. The worst part is that after wiring the panels, I have been asked to test I/O in live panels using methods that would make an OSHA representative have a stroke. Also, I can see after 2 months that there is going to be significantly more required travel than they made it seem like there would be when I interviewed. In my interview it was a side note, like “oh yeah, we have to travel for for some field work, but it’s only for ~1 week(no big deal) and you won’t be going very often because we are hiring you to do mostly office work.” Now that I am there I have been told that field work is typically 2-3 weeks at a time, working every day for 12+ hours in a junk yard/construction site/warehouse, and that I will be going soon and often, and that while in the field I will be doing more of the hands-on work that I don't want to be doing.

I am making a salary of about $45,000, which is significantly less money than I had expected to while I was in school.

As you can see, I have a handful of issues with the job. I would love some feedback on whether or not these are specific to my current employer, or if I had false expectations of what an electrical engineering job would be like. If this is commonly what control systems jobs are like, then what type of EE job should I be looking for if I would prefer to be spending my time in an office or lab doing more design/programming or research?

Also, if my complaints are legitimate, then what do I do now? How long am I supposed to stay at this job before I am allowed to go someplace else? I do like my coworkers/boss very much so I don’t want to come off as a dick to them if I leave, but this job also isn’t what I was expecting and I have to do something that I get some enjoyment out of.

TL;DR: Lower than expected pay, lots of hands on work, possible dangerous environment, lots of travel/crappy working conditions in the field. Is this a crappy job or did I have false expectations?

1357008738.0,42,self.ECE,15r7rw,Remember that 16x4 far infrared sensor from last week?  I ordered one and hooked it up.  Video and pictures inside. ,electrocoder,44,2,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/15r7rw/remember_that_16x4_far_infrared_sensor_from_last/,"ArtistEngineer [mentioned this part recently](http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/159wbq/component_of_the_year_firray_16x4_far_infrared/) and I was intrigued, so I ordered one.   It actually works really well. 

Here are some pics and a video of it in operation.  

* [video of it detecting my hand](https://vimeo.com/56574335)
* [top view](http://www.electrocoder.com/fir_sensor/front_sm.jpg)
* [screen](http://www.electrocoder.com/fir_sensor/screen_sm.jpg)
* [sensor board](http://www.electrocoder.com/fir_sensor/sensor_board_sm.jpg)

In the video, the pixels seem to turn black with heat, but actually they are turning red, it's just that my horrible little camera can't make sense of it.

My rules for this project were that I couldn't spend any money on it, aside from the $70 sensor, and that I needed to get it done as quickly as possible so I could get back to real work.  So, my apologies for the sloppy construction...

Fortunately, I had an Atmel dev board (EVK1101, with a 12Mhz AT32UC3B0256) and LCD display that I had previously used as a mockup.  All that was left to do was to connect the sensor and bit-bang I2C to talk to it.

The sensor *seems* to be a strictly 2.6V part, although the datasheet implies that it might work at 3.3V.  Not wanting to take any chances, I used a transistor to create a open collector output with a pullup to 2.6V for SDA, and used 2 diodes to drop the 3.3V SCL line to something that would work without exceeding 2.6V. 

I couldn't find my stash of adjustable regulators, so I used an op-amp wired as a voltage follower to supply 2.6V to the sensor. 

The documentation is pretty straightforward.  The most annoying part was the small mountain of math that is required to make sense of the sensor values.  Thankfully, the datasheet includes a walkthough of the equations with sample values, so it was easy to write test routines to make sure that math was getting done correctly.

Anyway, it worked, and I am pleased with the results.",,False,,t5_2r2sg,1357011174.0,,,True,t3_15r7rw,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/15r7rw/remember_that_16x4_far_infrared_sensor_from_last/,

I'm planning on scrapping the thing and sending it to be recycled.

However,  I was very intriguing by the motherboard, and I thought it would be fun to take some pictures of it to share.  

[Here is an album of the pictures I took] (http://imgur.com/a/zeOt1).  The first picture is a view of the scope from the underside.  The inputs are on the bottom left.  The second picture is a view from the top that shows the CRT.  There is a big empty space where the DC/DC converter was, I had already taken that out.  The third is a close up of the input sections.

The motherboard looks like a work of art!  The build quality looks very good.  The circuitry is not what I expected for an oscilloscope.  I thought you would only need a few passives for the inputs, a few ADC chips, and your microcontroller(s) and RAM.  Instead there are passives and chips everywhere!  And lots of discretes as well.  Also, the way the components are wired is very interesting; the wires aren't grouped into too many buses, instead it seems very point to point between all of the components.

Also note how one of inputs was never populated.  I guess the 4 channel version of this scope was the same hardware as the 2 channel, just with those components added.

If there are any former HP or Agilent engineers who worked on this, I'd like to hear your thoughts.  Also, if anyone is interested I can take some more pictures.

Anyway, we've returned with a new subreddit to replace our faltering link site (formerly discuss.theamphour.com). We'll be placing links we'll be talking about on future shows, including discussions and questions people have. It's located over at /r/TheAmpHour

**Question: Why don't you just post the links on /r/ECE?**

Because I would spam the hell out of the subreddit. I submit on average 15 links per week and they're not always relevant. As such, I am keeping it separate. It's more of a link journal for myself, but I enjoy when people add their opinions on items.

**Question: Why the hell do you think /r/ECE cares about your show?**

Well, I don't. Hopefully people know about it, but a lot of people don't enjoy the style or have time to listen to a podcast about electronics. So that's another reason to keep it separate.

**Question: Won't we just see lots of links show up on multiple subreddits?** 

Not from me. People might cross link, but I don't plan to. We try to stick to hobbyist and industry news and /r/ECE seems to trend more towards the academic side of electronics. So if you'd like to learn more about industry stop on by.

Hopefully this post doesn't seem too spammy, just wanted to say my piece before getting over to the new spot.

Some of the items are 10-15 years old.  USB cables, video cards, laptop batteries, wall warts, etc.

These parts are a commingled mess of fiberglass, lead, ceramics, aluminum, etc.   I plan on taking them to an e-waste recycling center.  Who knows what they'll do with them.  They might just ship it to a cancer village in China to be melted down for scrap.

It got me thinking, as EEs, we spend our careers designing and building these items.  The economies of several countries are based on fabricating these items.  We build boards, we build chips.  But every 5-10 years, they are just going to be thrown away, and replaced with newer ones.  What's the point?  So we can Twitter? Read Facebook?  Surf Reddit?

In one of my classes, the professor calls on random students to work out problems, and it's killing me to go to class for this very reason. I often don't understand the material as the professor teaches, but supplemented with outside study, I do. However, the problems that we work out in class are relevant to the material studied that day. 

I feel like I've been thrown in the water without knowing how to swim. Our first lab, this upcoming Monday, is over material we have yet to cover, but we're expected to come ready with a correct circuit and program.

For my 3rd year Electrical Engineering design project I am building a custom electric meat smoker.  What I want it to be is PID controlled with 2 internal temperature probes, 4 meat temperature probes, a 1500 Watt element, and a wood weight monitoring station.  All of this data will be relayed to your smartphone where you can monitor everything in time vs temperature graphs, and control the temperature using your smartphone. For now we are just going to be using an old steel fridge for the smoker. When I am done I will be posting this to instructables for anyone to build.

For our design we are required to have ""customers"" to interview to ensure our design is meeting your needs.  I was hoping you guys could tell me any additional features or specs that you would want the smoker to have and we will ensure that it meets them.  This can be operating temperature range, amount of temperature probes, operating range of wireless, cost, etc.  Please leave no stone unturned for ideas as you will all have access to the plans eventually.

Thank you very much and I look forward to your replies.",,False,,t5_2r2sg,False,,,True,t3_16n1kh,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/16n1kh/3rd_year_electrical_engineering_smoker_project/,

I was interviewed at Bose Corp a couple months ago. I had a job offer on the table and would have turned down Bose's offer regardless: The interviewers, who i would be working with, showed no personal warmth or care; one would interrupt me while I was in middle of a proof and question me about something that I was about to finish proving. When I asked  what is one thing you would change/improve about this place: ""I Wish it was more fun.""

**Here is the problem:**

You have an oscilloscope and a function generator connected to each other with a coaxial cable (standard 50 ohm). 

Your function generator is running a 100KHz Square wave(Too low for transmission line eqs)  at 1V peak to peak. 

The Oscilloscope shows that you, in fact, have a 100Khz signal at *2V* Peak to peak. 

 what is wrong with either of these devices or how do you figure out whats broken and why?

You can't use other oscilloscopes (or they are showing the same result)  and using a multimeter gives you unreliable/inconsistent results.

EDIT: 
More Information for ya:
There were 4 channels on the scope. Each channel gave me the same response. 

I couldn't get the signal to align. I messed with the time divisions and it just wouldn't settle (I wasnt allowed to use the auto button) the voltage divisions were correct, I even used the probes on the scope to measure the peak to peak by hand. 


I attached the Z-trigger and it looked correct on the scope. I would also get the same response no matter which channel i used (I had 4 different ones)

Need going forward advice and support.,morrowind89,34,6,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/1kajzr/bombed_an_interview_need_going_forward_advice_and/,"Background: I graduated this past May with an EE degree. Had an interview with a big company for a job I really wanted in a location that I actually like.


I totally messed up the interview. They asked me slightly technical questions, some of which I hadn't even heard of before, and if I did it know the topics it was something from 3 or 4 years ago. I'm not allowed to share what the exact questions were until after all of the other interviews are over.


They asked me moderately technical questions related to what I've actually done and I couldn't answer a single one definitively. At the end I could tell they thought I was a complete moron who doesn't know the basic theories about stuff. I know that I did but a lot of it has been filed away somewhere in my brain.


What is wrong with me! I know I know what I'm doing; I've made a small Zigbee network and I've made a robot but these little fundamental things totally tripped me up when they asked me.


Am I expected to always know everything about my major? Ugh. I could tell they thought I was a complete moron by the end of the interview. I know there's little to no chance that I will get a call to come in to meet them in person, and I'm really disappointed because that is where I would shine. With a piece of paper and pencil and the actual interviewers in front of me I just feel a lot less pressured and I can work through trying to derive the answer to the question they are asking me without feeling rushed. I should have said something like ""I may not remember all of these little things someone with google could know, but I have a lot of hands-on experience with this actual technology."" Would that have helped at all? Should I email the interviewer this?? Should I just keep quiet until they hear from them (in 3+ weeks)??


I don't really know what I came here to say but I just needed to get that out of my system. What should I do going forward? How/am I supposed to remember every little thing and be ready for anything?

I'm reading the book ""MSP430 Microcontroller Basics"" in hopes to better understand microcontrollers.  It's been an interesting and frustrating experience reading through this.  Reading the first couple chapters however, I found out that it's really not for the beginner (despite what I've been told)!  He talks about complicated memory systems, and other stuff very briefly; unfortunately, I have not been exposed to many of the things Davies explains to.  

Basically I would read a paragraph, hop on google to find out the basic definition of what he's talking about (in example, a von Neumann Architecture, or even what a data bus was), and re-read the paragraph in hopes to understand what's going on.  Going through a page took more than an hour at times ...

So my question is... My beginning intention to read this book was because I wanted to learn about microcontrollers beyond Arduino, but now I find myself spending the last 3-4 days writing notes on registers, and how the hexadecimal system works, etc. etc.

I found out my working-knowledge of computers was littered with holes and misunderstandings.  I questioned whether I should branch off my original microcontroller-teaching and better equip myself with the basics before I move back into the MSP430 book. 

I've been searching around for websites/pdfbooks but I wanted to get a better resource from none other than the experts here at reddit.  I want to learn how CPU's talk to different peripherals, how registers and bits eventually form some kind of command, and all the other stuff I'm totally missing out on..

I wasn't even sure what this ""field"" was.  Is it Computer Architecture?  CompSci?  I'm willing to buy a textbook if I have to.

So in conclusion... what are your recommended resources that explain ""computer architecture"" (I guess I'll just call it this for now, even though I'm not even sure what to call it) to a beginner?",,False,,t5_2r2sg,False,,,True,t3_16snb1,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/16snb1/reading_msp430_microcontroller_basics_by_j_davies/,

I found some small boards that just have the FPGA on them and a bunch of pins. I think a development board like the one I linked to would be nice to get started, but if I eventually want to make something I would want one of these smaller boards. Any recommendations for what I should get?

Also, what development software should I use? I would want something free or cheap, and Linux compatibility is a plus.

My salary started out low so Im still around 60k after raises. Ive been trying to get out into other areas like power and high voltage (UPS) side of EE but no one will even give me an interview. On a  daily basis I use every test bench equipment you can think of not to mention making labview programs for automation and testing..

Trying to get into this Utility company for three years now- I now have an opportunity to take an engineering technician ( electrical technician work in said utility providing electric/gas )  job which pays about the same but the benefits are better. I’m thinking that this is the only way I can get into an engineering role in the long run. They also pay for a masters. The job is kind of an advanced electrician I suppose because ill be working in power plants and playing with heavy industrial stuff ( not residential wiring)

This is an anonymous account so I’ll say what I feel. I think that im over qualified for this job since it “prefers” a 2 year associates in lieu of no work experience. I have a bachelors , 2 internships in software and almost 2 years in a more advanced role. I think Im downgrading and this could hurt me in the long run. 

Have any of you gone this route? Started at technician level with a bachelors and then moved up? Or has any of you downgraded for any reason from a “better job”? my current workplace has 100 employees and there is no movement up the ladder since everyone has been here for 15+ years. They’ll have to die before i get promoted.

TLDR: Trying to start from scratch so I can move into another industry as an engineer except I'm not sure if this will work out

edit: i will upload my resume for others to judge if I'm doing something wrong on paper. Maybe you guys can help me fix it. Currently at work ( break). Thanks in advance ( really confused)

The company I am working for is planning to build a device with a 7 inch touch screen (preferably with LVDS interface and capacitive touch). We have asked around our usual suppliers and checked big retailers like digikey in order to find one for a suitable price. But the cheapest we have found are still around $200 at 1k volumes. 

Now I can understand that touch screens are a delicate piece of technology, and therefore expensive, but at the same time, how is it that I am able to buy a complete tablet PC with a 7"" touch screen for $ 59 from a cheap china supplier?

Clearly screens can't cost that much to produce if they are able to be sold as parts of $ 60 tablets. So why is it that they are so expensive? does the cheap tablets use screens from dubious brands that no EE worth his salt would associate with? or are the suppliers taking ultra high margins on displays since they know that they used to be super expensive? does anyone have any other ideas/explanations?

Whiteboards.

Yes! 1 mA of current would flow across the resistor, and there would be a voltage drop of 9V, and there would be 9 mW of power dissipated! But that's the extent of my knowledge.

* Why do electrons flow out of the battery from high to low potential? (Or rather... holes...? Electrons flow from - to +... why?) 
* How do electrons flow through the conductor (metal)?
* Why does metal conduct?
* What causes electrons to ""slow down"" in the resistor? (Or do they even slow down? Is it better explained as ""lose energy""?)
* Why do electrons travel at (near) the speed of light?

Any volunteers?__

**Edit: Here's exactly what I'm talking about. Sort of. http://jumptuck.com/2010/08/12/porting-avr-code-for-msp430-chips/ **

So I've become fairly familiar with a bit of the Atmel family, namely the mega's, tiny's, and xmega's--writing my code in notepad, and then compiling with a Makefile and avr-gcc.

I picked up the MSP430 the other day though, and was thrown off by the different coding style. The watchdog is enabled by default!?

I think it'd be very much worthwhile to have a set of guides... ""If you know how to use ______, here's a quick transition to teach you how to use ______."" It should include everything, like

* Obtaining a toolchain (sanely)
* How to build from C to hex by hand
* How to program from hex to the uC
* How to debug your program on the uC
* What libraries are available, if any
* Basic routines (Serial / bit banging / SPI)
* Overview of Registers, etc
* How to layout a circuit board, minimum requirements

from the perspective of someone who's very familiar with the original family. For example, I might say...

-----

The tiny/mega AVRs are all similar. When switching to the XMega, you can still use avr-libc. However, you'll need a programmer that can handle the new PDI interface. This interface uses the reset line and PDI pin to program the device -- although it uses the same old 2x3 pin header, you don't need to hook up to the SPI bus anymore. This will *greatly* ease circuit board manufacture. Also, you won't need to worry about adapting your board to share the SPI line with a programmer and miscellaneous hardware.

A great addition to the xmegas, is that all the registers are now grouped into structures. Instead of TCCR1A/B/C, OCR1A, etc etc... You now have TIMER1.CNTLA/B/C, TIMER1.OCRA. This greatly eases programming.

Speaking of registers, fuses have been done away with. If you want to use an external CPU, or change the frequency you operate at, you do it all in code.

Some misc stuff...

* Interrupts are now nestable, and can be assigned priorities.
* Pretty much every pin can become an interrupt.
* You can set pins as pull up / pull down
* There is a DMA driver now. Instead of transferring every byte to UDR, you can request the DMA to transfer X bytes from (your memory address) to &amp;UDR.

Hi all, 

So over time while at work, I have come up with some techniques to try and solve certain problems, etc. They are nothing earth-shattering, but (I think) quite useful and unique in their own way, and that being said, they would sort of straddle DSP, Machine Learning, maybe statistical analysis too, etc.

At the same time, I never really had the chance to publish papers while in undergrad or grad school, (I have some from conferences), but nothing from while at academia. 

I read IEEE papers often and so I kinda know the 'jist' of them. 

I would like to build up my 'papers-published' resume, and I figured why not do it this way, but I have a couple questions:

* First of all, I would not be associated with academia at all, it would be purely 'me myself and I', although I suppose I would do it under the company I work for. Is this a problem?

* Having read a lot of IEEE papers, I notice some really good, some just terrible, some are easy reads, some might as well have been written on Omicron Prime, etc. I also tend to find a lot of plagiarism. Either-way, I basically tend to find a lot of different types of papers, but still, is there some 'common denominator' I should aim for when writing it? Do I have a fighting chance? Just what is the criteria for publishing? I should actually ask - what is the *effective* criteria for publishing, since I see many different kinds of papers on there. 

* This is also weird but - where *exactly* do I ""go"" and submit a paper to? Which site(s)? I am somewhat confused by IEEE, journals, transactions, blah blah blah, so who/where do I submit a paper to?

  * Is there a limit to how many times you can submit a paper?
  * What criteria are used to determine if you can publish?

I was messing around today cutting apart some electronic components with my rotary tool and decided to take some pictures of stuff I had. I'm don't really know that much about photography and used a camera I borrowed from my sister but I think they came out looking nicely. I plan to cut open the processor and see what's inside there. I'm hoping the metal top isn't epoxied to the die and since it's probably flip chip, it's more interesting than just the bottom of the die. I also had the innards of two sizes of crystal oscillators and a general purpose transistor but I forgot to take pictures of them.

The first five images are of a clock oscillator that I cut the metal top of. There was more in there than I thought, then again I haven't messed around with one of these yet. The top of the metal casing was 1.33cmX1.1cm.

Next three images are of a DIP14 package that I ground the plastic away. I didn't have any fuming nitric acid so I couldn't get anything great looking. The die in the middle is 1mmx1mm and was a LM339 (I think).

The next eight pictures are of, what looks to be a finished IC wafer. It's 12.5cm in diameter and each individual die is about 2.9mm. The last image in this set is the back of the wafer. I'm not sure what IC is on the wafer but the package it came in had the label ""DEVICE(W48C60-424) WAFER #9 LOT # CG80528, GOOD DIE 1045"". If you view the detail on the ""Do3Da"" image, you can see pretty clearly what looks like the pad cells around the edges

Picture 17 is a blank wafer that is 10cm in diameter. The front is very polished but the back is evenly diffused. It's also much thicker than the other wafer but I think the other one was thinned due to the spiral pattern on the back. The two images after this one are just combinations of the others to compare sizes.

The next four are of two gold color IC dies that are 1.68cmX1.29cm. I have no clue what they are and are a bit scratched up.

Then there is the arduino which I have heard good things about but have never actually used.

So now it comes down to which one. I will be getting this primarily as toy so cost is important but on the other hand I would rather spend a few bucks more for something more usable. I'm open to other platforms if you know of something better.

I'd also like to know if you would recommend getting a full protoboard or if i would be better off just getting processor and a programmer.

Btw just so you know, I know a decent bit of ARM assembly, C++, Basic/VB, and a few bits and pieces of various other languages.

EDIT* I have decided I want to get something that starts off with the full board so that its easier for me to get started.

http://www.amazon.co.uk/Printed-Circuit-Design-Techniques-Compliance/dp/0780353765

**Why did I like this book?**

It's a very practical book that is light on the maths but heavy on the theory. At the end of each chapter it summarises all the theory into simple-to-remember bullet points. i.e. rules-of-thumb. You can read this book and immediately feel confident as a designer.

**But I don't care about EMC compliance, I just design my own projects!**

EMC compliance means low noise and low emissions. This means your circuits will work better and they will be less susceptible to outside interference. Why? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antenna_(radio)#Reciprocity

Yes, it's an expensive book, but the cost is worth the hassle of having to fix your circuit. In fact, I don't even own a copy of this book. I read the copy that my previous employer owns. I regret that I didn't ""borrow"" it when I left. ;)

**DISCLAIMER:** I'm not Montrose and I don't get any money from this! You're more than welcome to buy it elsewhere, I'm just using the Amazon link because it's convenient and worldwide.

I don't want this project to look like something a hobbyist did, I have plenty of crap like that already. Therefore, it's worth the extra design effort to go with a chip that's currently used in the industry. Thoughts on that? Suggestions for Microcontroller families that will be useful on a resume?

I've looked at the packets I am sending and they appear to be correct.

This semester I'm taking circuit analysis, data structures and algorithms in C++, and several other ECE related courses. I'm panicking. It's only the third week of classes and I feel like I'm already falling behind. This is especially true in C++. I did well in my first C++ class and I also took two Java classes before so I understand most of the logic. But now we are getting more in depth into the stuff that isn't in Java, like pointers. Everyone else in the class gets it though! My professor doesn't have office hours, but there is a learning center manned by graduate students. However, the learning center usually has only one or two grad students tutoring, and it's full of kids trying to get help from all levels of C++. I'm starting to think I should switch into EE (even though I love programming... when I get it). Is there any advice from /r/ECE? Did you guys immediately grasp the material? Or is this something that takes more than a few years in college to learn? Any ideas on what I should do?

PS. My C++ professor is really mean. I've tried talking to him and he often says ""If this is too hard for you, maybe you should just drop this class."" Not the first bad professor I've had, but I can't drop this class unless I want to lose my financial aid.

Or do you?  

I've got a few procedural style drivers (two LCD's, a Bluetooth, an IMU) that I use in my projects on a few relatively powerful microcontroller ""discovery"" boards e.g. STM32F4-Discovery. So far I've just #included them as a library and called the relevant functions from my main code.  

I've decided to switch to an OOP style of implementation so that I can change components without altering the main code (and to learn more about modular programming.) To that end, I have reorganized the drivers into classes e.g. class LCD6610Epson {}. That all worked out fine but now I'm kind of lost as to how to properly abstract them (and wondering if what I'm doing is even a good idea.)  
In my mind, the ideal solution is to create a generic Display class&lt;-LCD class&lt;-LCD6610Epson class. This way I could send output to any display in the main code and worry about what that display actually is in the Display class, which controller it's using in the LCD subclass and the actual driver in the LCD6610Epson ""subsubclass"". The idea is that I could then swap out the LCD and only have to worry about changing the ""subsubclass."" Same thing goes for the Bluetooth (Communicator class&lt;-Bluetooth class&lt;-BTHC05 class) and for every device connected.

Am I on the right track here i.e. is what I'm attempting sane?  
Am I abstracting the driver too many levels away for readable code i.e. should I just leave out the display and LCD classes?  
Should I have each class in a separate library e.g. display.c lcd.c lcd6610EpsonController.c?  
Do you know of/could you give me a good example of this sort of thing? I've googled but haven't come up with much concerning embedded devices and this sort of abstraction.   

Thanks in advance Reddit, you are my huckleberry.

I've noticed that I'm a lot happier and more excited about the various electronics projects that I do for fun than I am about the profession that I went into.

I'll save the rant about why I want far far away from science and answer the first question that always comes up.  I won't be going back to school for a PhD in chem.

I took all the math that would be needed.  I even took a senior level math class in signal processing which was mostly me and a room of EEs.  I took fortran and I know very basic java and C++

Right now I'm working my way through that MITx course on electronics.  I have an ongoing 3d printer project and as a way to build on my math/programming/electronic knowledge I started working on a balancing robot that will be designed and printed on my 3d printer.  After that I have more project ideas than I know how to implement. 

On to the problem.  I'm quitting my job to follow my girl friend across the country.  She's a vet and is doing a one year residency thing at an animal hospital out there.  This means no in-state tuition and although I have some savings there is no way I could afford out of state tuition anywhere.  The current plan is to find a chem job out there, work for a year, move again to more permanent location, work for a year to get in-state, go to school.

For one of my solid state physics classes, I looked into graphene and how graphene is being integrated into transistors. Graphene has alot of very interesting and potentially useful electrical characteristics and during my research, I found some new transistor designs based around graphene.

One of these designs created a tunable bandgap for the transistor. My simplified understanding of this was that based upon the electric field applied to the graphene structure, a bandgap could be created and then tuned between .25 - .5 eV.

This got me to think, if the bandgap can be controlled at runtime, then the transistor can be more or less able to turn on or off. I think this could potentially lead to different types of logic circuits and maybe even get computers out of binary and to a larger base (though the applications of the larger base may only be in arithmetic).

My work schedule this summer is not so intensive, so I figured I could use the extra time to do some sort of DIY project to learn more about electronics. I'm doing a Bachelor+Master degree, and I'm almost done with all my bachelor courses (some minor courses + the thesis). Unfortunately most of my courses so far have been quite on the theoretical side, and most of the practical stuff comes during the master's courses. I still would like to get some practical hands-on experience so that I can actually say that I have some experience in electronics when I'll be looking for my next internship.

What I've done so far in my courses on the electronics side is pretty much covered in [parts I. and II. of Sedra&amp;Smith](http://www.oup.com/us/companion.websites/9780195323030/book/toc/), so I got a pretty OK basic knowledge from the theoretical side. When it comes to programming I can do C, Java and Python. 

I still have no idea how this stuff works in the ""real world"". I've done some really basic simulations with software (LTSpice mostly), and also conducted some basic lab courses where I got to play with oscilloscopes, function generators and so on.
There's an electronics lab with more fancy equipment that's free for students to use for own projects, but during the summer it's only open once a week so it would be nice if I can do it at home.

So, where should I start? What stuff should I be buying? Any other advice?",,False,,t5_2r2sg,1373459118.0,,,True,t3_1i03t2,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/1i03t2/ee_student_looking_for_an_electronics_project_for/,

My professor has recently taken me on as a research assistant after completing his microcontrollers/embedded systems class. He's given me a project to take over and I was wondering if I could ask for some help? I'm still in the process of taking a few circuits classes, and for that reason, I still haven't gotten into reading PCB schematics yet.  How do I go about reading/approaching this given that I do know most of the circuitry fundamentals? I guess it looks a bit daunting since I'm more used to the software side!

this is a portion of it. It's basically using the MSP430 to create an ECG monitor. I'm guessing the op-amps do the filtering/amplifying of the signals from the leads, but I'm confused to how the parts seem to jump all over the places. What do the numbers/letters near grounds/vcc's indicate in the context of a PCB?  I guess this is something I'll learn in signals or my next circuits class, but why are the caps placed in the way they are with regards to the op-amps? I've only worked in circuits where resistors are hooked up to them. 

For context, I switched out of bioengineering into CompE recently so I'm trying to catch up on my hardware background. I really want to show my prof that I can handle this, so if anyone could direct me to some resources on reading schematics, using op-amps in regards to signals, etc. that would be great.

I had internships in test engineering and I found the work to be a little boring and not too challenging. I was only an intern but I saw the work  that other engineers were doing and it was very repetitive and nobody looked excited to be there. 


I would like to know more about the various job titles. How do you like them? Which is the best in your opinion? 


I have interned at large companies where everybody seemed to have one particular skill-set and that is all they ever get to work on. I would like to be more involved in various stages of a project. 

Thanks.

I would like to ask you a question. People keep insisting that the most important tool an electrical/electronics enginner has is his/(her?) multimeter and that you should invest lots of money to buy a good one.

While it is certainly true that the multimeter is our most important tool I can not really see why someone should buy a high end one. 

Is it that high end multimeters tend to have more functions than basic ones (USB connectivity, autorange etc)?

Is it that high end multimeters are safer?

Is it that the better built quality makes them last longer?

""end it in, we'll quote it!""  I don't want to get dinged for excessive re-quotes.

I know if I were making zillions, I'd save the placement, but for more moderate quantities, I have to decide: assuming board space is no problem, should I replace a 330 ohm by 3x1K, and a 2K ohm by 2x 1K, to drop two line items off the BoM?  I know the extra parts costs me about $0.01/part/board, so if an additional BoM item is $15 in administrative overhead, the extra 3 parts are worth it in quantities under 1000.

But is $15 a reasonable cost for the staff time to price the BoM, pull the reel, and mount it on the machine?

It comes up with resistors a lot, since you need a lot of different values and can do tricks with series &amp; parallel, but sometimes I need 470 nF of decoupling somewhere and I could just throw 4 of the 100 nF parts I use everywhere at it rather than have a unique value.

Going to higher costs, once I needed 6 op-amps, and wondered if I should populate 3 duals, 2 quads, or a dual and a quad.  It turned out that the quad was more than 2x the cost of the dual (it was a precision op-amp, and presumably yields were lower or something), so it was an easy decision, but normally the same sort of problem applies.

Has anyone got a ballpark value they like to use?

I would love to be able to make a computer in a vein like those early machines, but with some twists. What would be a good route to take to get into that sort of thing?

I like the idea of a Z80 that you can still buy, but that is a little bit faster now. It seems hard to find RAM chips that would work easily. An SD card slot seems like the easiest way to use as storage. I would love to find some kind of a VGA LCD (something that isn't a tiny form factor) that is less than a hundred dollars that I could interface to what ever 'old' style chip I chose.

Any resources that could be suggested to me? I don't want to simply copy what is out there now, but would love to look at designs that have been done in a similar vein. 

EDIT: Considering the things people are talking about, I should add that I have used an some of the atmel chips - even in assembly. I am not sure those chips would be appropriate for this though.

I can look at the 6502 modern chips, might be interesting.

EDIT2: I have found the information about the course I would eventually be taking. It uses a 68HC11 micro. The course lectures is [here](http://courses.muscedere.com/8832701/lectures.shtml) and the textbook is [here](http://www.amazon.com/Microprocessors-Microcomputers-Hardware-Software-6th/dp/0130609048/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1302670951&amp;sr=8-1). One of the documents said that although it shouldn't be used new designs, it does provide a simple instruction set.

I would love to have a project like this prepare me. Although I can learn any assembly language fairly easily.

I'm a student entering the third year of a BSc in Electrical and Electronical Engineering at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, EPFL, in Lausanne.

One of the courses we're taking this year is Automatique I, or Control and Feedback Systems.

Earlier this summer I distinctly recall there being a wiki textbook for Control Systems hosted by a university I cannot for the life of me remember anymore. 

I found a Wikibook for Control Systems but I'm fairly sure it wasn't that I had seen.

I'd much appreciate it if anyone happened to know which textbook I'm referring to! I remember it was very complete and I looked forward to making use of it in the next semester but being a moron I failed to bookmark it and now I can't figure out where it is.

I found that the University of Michigan has a Control Systems textbook for Chemical Processes but it's not really what I'm looking for

**EDIT:**

I FOUND IT!

I recently took an Embedded systems class at school and have been asked to come back as both a TA and a researcher in my professors lab. I did well in the class, but I feel it was only because of my final project. I want to get a better understanding of the Embedded world and I was wondering what would be topics I should definitely focus on? 

From reading posts on here and on glassdoor, it seems like I should know the intricacies of C inside and out. I've also seen the JTAG debugger, serial communication protocols, and a few other topics mentioned. I've asked my professor if I could start working on one of his lab's projects while I'm at home this summer. He has an ECG patch that uses the CC2540 BLE SoC, which i've heard is great for low power med devices (very interested in med since I was originally a BME). There's currently a problem on the patch that is preventing the SoC from receiving data from the CMA3000 due to the SPI pin configuration. Reading datasheets is not that big of a deal, so I think I understand why the problem is occurring. Is there any way I could use this opportunity to learn more about the embedded world? If I fully take on this project, I would have to remake the PCB as well to make room for a CMA3000 footprint (another thing I haven't really done). 

The project I worked on during the class was a text to braille generator using a couple of ARM mbed microcontrollers. I know how to use/work with the ADC, Interrupts, PWM, ZigBee, and Ethernet. I've been reading up on the different serial comm. protocols as well as cache/memory management using C.  Where do I go from here if I want to be a good embedded systems or firmware engineer?

On the one hand it makes sense to measure it in the linear region just because the MOSFET acts like a typical resistor. However, on the other hand, I figured most applications use a MOSFET in saturation, so it would be more relevant to know the Rdson in Saturation (or basically just Isat). 

If the MOSFET Rdson is in fact typically measured in the linear region, then how do you guys typically interpret it if your design uses the MOSFET in saturation?

But I just can't decide which technology to go with for this project.  Basically, I'm making a very simple datalogger that will be battery powered.  It will need to run for several days at a time so power consumption is important.  I've read about the differences between the two, and it seems that either would work out just fine.  Here's the key aspects to the design:

-  The user will only need to access the data on the device via wireless connection every few days.

-  There could be more than one device that should be accessible from the computer, it doesn't have to be simultaneous and there would realistically be no more than 10 dataloggers in use at a time.

-  The range should be a minimum of 100ft. line of site.

-  There is not a lot of data to be transmitted so I'm not at all concerned about the data rate.

Note that Rth is a varying resistance measured by the thermal sensor. 

Earlier this week I managed to get everything working and measured a stable temperature for about 2 days. Then all of a sudden the board started acting up. Verified that none of the component values were adjusted, nothing was changed but the controller refuses to function properly anymore. Instead of locking onto a setpoint temperature (voltage) it keeps drifting; and if it does lock it drifts after a few minutes. 

Not sure what could have caused this problem. Maybe running the controller board for 2 days? Any feedback is much appreciated.",,False,,t5_2r2sg,False,,,True,t3_143weg,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/143weg/help_with_pid_loops/,

I recently completed my Masters in ECE at a top ten school. I picked a broad set of courses as I wanted to have my options open after graduating. I took courses in Signal Processing, Networks and also Computer Architecture.

I am now finding the work at my current company repetitive and not challenging. I want to make the transition to a more technical role. Hopefully something in Comp Arch or Networking. With the job scenario now, it seems that I don't qualify as a new college grad even though I'll be competing for the same positions. If I want to apply for a regular position, they all require 2-3 years work ex in that field.

How hard will it be to convince a hiring manager to hire someone with experience in an unrelated field. I am scared that I have been at this job for a year (and counting) and will be pigeonholed into similar roles. That being said, I am relatively young (24) and don't want to work in a field that doesn't excite me for 30 more years.

Why not Norton?,fatangaboo,21,7,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/ktj76/job_interview_question_why_thevenin_in_the_home/,"That is: why have we chosen a constant-Voltage specification rather than a constant-Current specification for household electricity?  Why is the mains power specified to be 115 VOLTS (ac) rather than, say, 15 AMPERES (ac)?  Every load has both a Thevenin equivalent AND a Norton equivalent, and the two are equally good - - - so why have we chosen a constant voltage spec (Thevenin)?   Was it purely arbitrary?  Did the Italian (Volta) have more charisma than the Frenchman (Ampere)?
   
Note: this question is perhaps best used on great candidates who have breezed through the first 45 minutes of the interview very impressively, allowing a few minutes of philosophizing at the end of the hour.
   
**UPDATE -**  Since this is a *job interview* question, its purpose is to give the interview candidate a chance to display insight and creative thinking, i.e., to impress the interviewer(s).  I've seen several dozen candidates work on this question (and others); the ones who impressed ME the most, began by discussing the assumptions which underly Thevenin equivalent circuits and Norton equivalent circuits.  Something like
   
&gt;Norton equivalent circuits and Thevenin equivalent circuits assume an idealized world, where wires have zero resistance and insulators have zero conductance.  In that idealized world, I suppose it's six of one and a half dozen of the other: standardize on Thevenin, standardize on Norton, who cares, they're *equivalent*.  But real people and their real houses aren't actually IN that idealized world.  Wires in real people's houses have nonzero resistance - and so do switch contacts.  Insulators (including air) have nonzero conductance and they also have a less-than-infinite breakdown voltage where they will suddenly conduct.  Even air has a breakdown voltage and will conduct electricity.
   
Then the really impressive candidates will make an unexpected or shrewd observation.  Perhaps something like
   
&gt; I think it's important to be able to switch the lights (or other electric appliances) completely and 100.000 percent *OFF*, in the real world.  Turning off a light in the Norton world means throwing a switch that places a zero ohm short across the light.  Turning off a light in the Thevenin world means throwing a switch that opens the circuit and puts an infinity ohm resistor in series with the light.  Since it's far easier to get a near-infinite resistance in the real world than to get a near-infinite conductance, I think the Thevenin viewpoint is a better match.
   
Another shrewd answer I've heard is
   
&gt; It bothers me that a Norton circuit which is ""off"" (dissipating no power) is a current source, in parallel with a Norton equivalent resistance, in parallel with a PERFECT SHORT CIRCUIT that reduces the voltage dropped to zero.  Yes the power (V times I) is zero because V is zero.  But the current isn't zero, and that bothers me!  I have a hard time accepting that an ""off"" circuit, which we might equally well call a circuit ""at rest"", nevertheless has got a lot of moving charge: I = dQ / dt.  I think this may have bothered the people who set the standard too, and they may have chosen the Thevenin equivalent because it doesn't have this philosophically troubling property.",,False,,t5_2r2sg,True,,,True,t3_ktj76,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/ktj76/job_interview_question_why_thevenin_in_the_home/,

It seems that at some schools CE focuses on programming (almost to the point of being a Software Engineer), while EE focuses on hardware (both digital and analog). 

At my school, EE's get a very small amount of programming, architecture, and focus more on analog design. CE's get a great deal more of programming, architecture, and VLSI, focusing more on digital design. Of course, the curicuulum is somewhat flexible and either degree can focus more on the individual's interests.

To measure revolutions, I'm using [this](http://www.diodes.com/datasheets/AH1751.pdf) Hall-effect sensor and a permanent magnet.

The output of the sensor says ""open-collector"" so I went and attached a pull-up resistor to the output so that I would have something I could send to my µC. My circuit is running at 5v.

The issue is, it seems that it's not a perfect open-collector chip.  I measured with a ammeter, and it looks like it sinks 2.5 mA when ""open"" and 5 mA when ""closed"".  I tried two others and they're all the same.

If I use a large pull-up (like 1kΩ), it sinks current faster than the resistor can supply it at the output pin so it never gets to 5v.  As is, I can use something like a 100Ω resistor and have it give me 4.5V when closed and 4.75 when open.

My current solution is to set up a comparator with an inverting input voltage somewhere in between 4.5v and 4.75v so that it can compare that value with the Hall-Effect sensor and give a more useful output for the µC.

Although this works, it seems like an incredibly contrived solution. Am I doing it right?  Is there some special way one is supposed to use this part?

The first obvious choice is a high speed camera sensor but that's pretty costly. My second idea was two cheaper camera sensors that can be triggered to each capture a single image. Resolution doesn't need to be high but the image needs to be clear. The two options for cheap camera sensors are CMOS and CCD. CMOS cameras are really common but the rolling electronic shutter can be an issue when trying to capture a high speed image.  CCD seems like a much better fit since it will sample all pixels at the same time providing what I hope is a clear image. The problem is that it's really easy to find CMOS camera sensors online but CCD sensors are almost non existent.

Does anyone have ideas for a relatively low cost (below $100) setup or a place where I can find CCD camera components? Thanks!

&gt;Employment of electrical and electronics engineers is expected to grow 6 percent from 2010 to 2020, slower than the average for all occupations. Job growth is expected because of electrical and electronics engineers’ versatility in developing and applying emerging technologies. On the other hand, employment growth will be tempered by the slow growth or decline of most manufacturing sectors in which they are employed.

If you at the job outlooks for the other engineering careers listed in the handbook, they tell more or less the same story:  job growth either slower than average or just about average, because ""employment is tied to the state of overall manufacturing in the United States.""

One exception is biomedical engineers, who are expected to have job growth faster than average, because of the baby-boom generation and their demand for healthcare devices.

I've become disgruntled with the overall apperance of the reports and documents that I've been producing. Throughout uni I'd been using word as my primary typesetting software, despite it leaving the distinct 'word' feel on the documents. I discovered LaTex about a year ago and loved it, I was using it mainly for short reports and assignments, but I found it difficult to create long reports (due to unfamiliarity), and very difficult to adjust the look of documents from the default themes.

I'm coming close to finishing university so I'm wanting to up my game as far as the appearance of my reports goes. I'm looking at creating documents as polished as those found in your typical semiconductor companies datasheets, application notes, and white papers. For example anything from TI, Microchip, Fairchild, all very consistent.

So, 

* What type setting software do you use? Word, OpenOffice, LaTeX, Publisher, etc. Also. specific examples of how you use your typesetting software to create polished documents. Tips, templates, tutorials, all would be welcome.
* What software do you use to create block diagrams/system level diagrams/wiring diagrams? I've used Visio throughout uni, recently switched to Dia but still have trouble creating anything near as good as found in a typical IC block diagram
* What do you use to create your graphs and plots? I ditched Excel the long ago, been using Matlab but as anyone who has used Matlab will tell you, it's a mission to make a report worthy plots using it. There has to be a better way.
* On a side note, what schematic capture software do you use? I love eagle aside from minor UI annoyances, NI multisim is crap (forced to use it for work, sigh). Datasheets always have a very consistant look to them which I've found difficult to replicate, this one was just out of interest.

When one op-amp is increasing in voltage, the other would be decreasing at the same rate (gain = -1). A small (0.1 ohm or so) sense resistor would be in series with the output load for constant current feedback. The supply would need to be capable of +/- 2 A or so at no more than +/- 30 V. The idea is that a +/- 15 V supply could be used, and since the op-amps would be configured in a push-pull configuration, +/- 30 V would be the theoretical maximum voltage available on the output. 

It would also be nice to have a way to set the maximum voltage on the output. Would a third power op-amp be required for this?

I've not yet had analog circuits at university, so my knowledge of op-amps is still fairly rudimentary. I will be taking it this fall, however.

I just finished watching it and it is about the unconscious mind.

So why am I posting about that here?

Near the very end of the episode, there was a Doctor who was showing BCI (brain computer interface) uses for image pattern analysis, and possible military uses.

Image analysts usually have to sit, wide eyed and perky, at a computer, staring for hours at images, looking for stuff.

The example this Doctor used was searching for structures in a +100km^2 photo of some semi-mountainous arid region. What he did was cut the image up into small sections, seemed to be about 500 or so of them.

He would then hook himself up to the computer via an EEG/BCI system. He would show himself sample images with structures in a similar location, training the computer to detect what he called an ""a ha"" moment, essentially his brain recognizing there is a structure.

Then he would load up this program, which flipped through the 500 of so images at about 5 to 10 images per second, while reading the EEG, and it would tag the images based on the data from the EEG and show a sort of heat map layered on top of the original 100km^2 image. He didn't even concentrate on finding structures, he just sort of zoned out and stared at them, and his brain would just trigger when it saw something. It was pretty awesome.

He didn't really talk about how well it worked, but it seemed, from the image, to work pretty damn good for this early in the development.

Figured you people might be able to use this information to make something cool. From what I can tell, most BCI research relies on conscious efforts of the user trying to do something, like that game where you try and lift a ball using your mind.",,False,,t5_2r2sg,False,,,True,t3_qysh9,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/qysh9/using_the_brain_for_pattern_recognition/,

I could also get an app for my Android phone, although I would have to build some sort of converter to get the signal into the mic input on my phone (not to mention voltage protection so I don't blow up my phone by accidentally putting 9 volts through it).

Any tips?

**Edit:** even $400 is a lot for me right now. I'd like to spend $100 or less.

**Edit 2:** Like I said, only audio signals, so nothing over 20 kHz. Bandwidth is really not an issue unless there are scopes out there with a bandwidth of less than 200 kHz.

**Edit 3:** I think I'm just going to end up [using my laptop's soundcard](http://www.yann.com/en/diy-turn-your-gnulinux-computer-into-a-free-oscilloscope-29/09/2010.html) for now.

I've had some experience building a few projects with AVRs. Started out with an Arduino and had no idea what was going on. Eventually read enough articles about Ladyada's USBtinyISP and felt comfortable enough to warrant buying the programmer and  experimenting with some tiny2313s'.

I've moved away from the 'duino bootloader fully now, and I'm quite comfortable laying out circuit boards with the mega's and tiny's... using avrdude to program the AVR8's... but I'm trying to expand my knowledge and move out to some other fields.

It looks like for other major microcontrollers (ARM, MSP430, etc) you either use a serial bootloader, a proprietary programmer, or a JTAG programmer.

I, however, only know avrdude and the USBtiny. How do other systems do it? What's open source enough that I can use notepad, the GCC tool chain and a makefile to take care of all my needs? Are there any programmers that work with multiple systems? Is laying out the circuit board much different?

Sorry for the rather vague and open ended question... TL;DR... I want to learn new microcontroller systems.

I've been trying to get something made as a simple Emergency Stop for a club im in. I went with these [Linx KH2 Modules](http://www.linxtechnologies.com/Documents/TXE-xxx-KH2_Data_Guide.pdf) (433Mhz Variety) which im placing on custom PCB's.

With the 1/4 Wave antenna I have, I need as large a ground plane as possible to act as the other 1/4 wave.  I've never done this, and  am pretty apprehensive about making this board before knowing that I'll get a decent range. 

Here's my board layouts: [Receiver Side](http://i.imgur.com/DelbK.png),  [Transmitter Side](http://i.imgur.com/StlcY.png) 

Each board is 3""x3"", with 2 layers on them. 

Do I have ""enough"" ground plane? Do I need to use Both top and bottom layers as ground plane? Can I get away with less? Do I need to worry about coupling of both layers if i use top and bottom? 

I've contacted Linx and I got their app notes, as well as it mentioning that I would need a ground plane at least 1/4 size in radius of the wavelength (so about 6' radius....aka too big.) The Data sheet also shows a recommended Ground Layout, which is damn close to mine. But I don't know if thats truely enough here. 


Any words of wisdom on this would be greatly appreciated.

Lightning is obvious, but why are mains voltages attracted to earth?

No one really seems to know.  The best answer so far is that Earth rods are driven in to the ground at substations and power stations so the earth acts as a massive conductor and creates a return path, essentially making the planet earth a big conductor.

So if you grab a bare live mains cable the current flows though you to earth then back to the earth rod at the power station / substation?

I'm taking a CSE class right now where we are supposed to design our own ISA to solve a problem, then design hardware to implement the ISA. We're making a single cycle processor, so our longest instruction becomes our clock-speed. Currently, in our design our ""slowest"" operation is carry look-ahead addition in our ALU. We realized however, that the only time we do addition is to increment by 1 (and we are working unsigned, so don't have to worry about sign bit). We were trying to figure out if there was a better, gate level implementation for an incrementer (given a binary number, return that number plus 1) that would be quicker than a carry look-ahead adder?

Edit: I guess a bit of clarification on the situation might help too. Our task is to design a fast, yet accurate (for our particular problem) ISA, and try and have a better runtime than our competitors (other students in the class). We claimed that by removing the adder hardware, and only incrementing, our clock cycle (time of slowest operation) would be faster than that of our opponents, which would lead to a faster runtime, even with a slightly higher instruction count. The thing is, we are a little stuck on proving that there is a circuit that CAN increment faster than a carry lookahead adder (so thought finding one might help prove one exists). We thought about a lookup, but the professor said that the number of muxes required to make that work would end up slower than an adder.",,False,,t5_2r2sg,True,,,True,t3_d0k1i,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/d0k1i/fastest_possible_hardware_incrementer_crosspost/,

Sv = 4 k T R .

In SI units, the right hand side evaluates to V^2 s, which we have to interpret as V^2 /Hz (or V^2 /cycle/s) in order for the answer to come out correctly.

In almost every other calculation, we treat 1 rad = 1.  For example,

sin(pi/2) = sin(pi/2 rad) = 1

w = 1/(RC) = 1/(1 s) = 1 rad/s (with RC = 1 s)

wo^2 = 1/LC = 1/(1 s^2 ) = 1 (rad/s)^2 (with LC = 1 s^2 )

Shouldn't the noise voltage formula be

Sv = 4 k T R / (2 pi)

instead?  Then we get V^2 s, which we can freely interpret as V^2 /rad/s, which is consistent with 1 rad = 1.

Otherwise, aren't we saying 1 cycle = 1, 1 rad = 1, therefore 1 cycle = 1 rad?  This is obviously wrong, as 1 cycle = 2 pi rad.  Why the inconsistency?

**EDIT:**

I think I understand what happened. Check out slide 4 [here (pdf)](http://www.physics.queensu.ca/~phys352/lect04.pdf).

The problem is that they chose df as the differential instead of dw, where df=dw/(2 pi rad)=dw/(1 cycle) is a normalized frequency. If they used dw instead, they would have found

Vc^2 = pi/2 Sv(0) / (RC)

so that

Vc^2 = pi/2 Sv(0) / (RC) = kT/C

implying

Sv(0) = 2/pi * kTR = 4 k T R / (2 pi) .

Hi ECE, I am not completely sure that this is the correct subreddit to post in, but during my quite extensive search adventures, this was the only place where I found people talking about building stuff with DDR memories.

Background:
I am a ultra-junior electrical/embedded hardware engineer (actually, I don't have my degree yet, I still need to present my thesis and finish of a fem small tasks from a few courses, but I have been working in the field for a complete 7 months :P) working for a contractor company and involved in designing a circuit based around a Freescale applications processor and using DDR3 memories.

Now I have a fairly good grasp of most of the design, except for the DDR3 part, that one scares the hell out of me. Our current DDR3 circuit design is mostly a complete copy-paste from a freescale demo board. Now I have tried to read up on it a bit on my own just to verify that it is a sound design (also, I prefer to know what I am doing, not just copying someone else's work) and I have run in to this wall of information that exists around DDR memories, and I haven't really found anything that starts from a level I am comfortable with. So I have some questions for the hive intelligence:

A more specific question:
The design I am following completely ignores Vtt terminations, could this be a sound design practice in some cases. Our (or should I say freescales) design use four discrete memory modules mounted on the same board as the processor (i.e. we are not using registers and DIMM connectors) does this make a difference?

A more general question:
Could somebody point me to a whitepaper or article that gives a good introduction to DDR3 design for a novice and very unexperienced engineer?

Many thanks in advance

P.S. The DDR3 design we have copied can be found on page 99 of this document:

I've often wondered if I could build (HA!) or buy a device to sit under my desk that I could pedal with my legs that would power and charge my laptop (currently an Apple MacBook Pro).

It seems like this could work for a few reasons:

* The laptop already has a battery in it and supporting power regulation hardware. So the generator might not have to have some of that stuff between it and the laptop. Maybe?

* It already expects DC power, so no need to convert to AC. This is an efficiency win, right?

* The 85W AC power adapter that comes with the laptop, from what I can tell, gives the laptop 18.5V at 4.6A (18.5 * 4.6 = 85.1W). [I've seen stationary bicycle generators](http://www.windstreampower.com/Bike_Power_Generator.php) that claim the average person can generate 80-150W sustainably. I cycle to work quite a bit and have decently strong legs, so I'm thinking I would at least be able to sustain 85W for a few hours / day. But please correct me if I'm wrong there!

So, what do you all think? Could this be built? Does it already exist? If it can't be built, why not? Which of my assumptions and research above are bad? Thanks!

EDIT: I should clarify, I'm not saying that I would directly connect a generator to the DC in port on my laptop. I'm asking questions about designing something that would safely and effectively accomplish the overall goal, which is power &amp; charge a laptop using something I can pedal under a desk (so more like an exercise bike setup vs. an actual road bike in a charging stand). If the built-in battery and voltage regulator in the laptop don't help me in this regard, then I'll ignore them and do whatever else I need to provide the cleanest power possible (i.e. have another battery in the generator unit, connect it to a flywheel w/ a regulator cutoff so the laptop's battery takes over, etc. etc.). It's a brainstorm, not a design review.

EDIT 2: Inspiration struck in the shower this morning! The [MagSafe airline adapter](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB441Z/A?fnode=MTY1NDEwMQ&amp;mco=MTA4NDE2Mjc) could be useful here. It says it doesn't charge the battery, but that may just be because the airline power ports only provide 75W of power. But if I built a generator / battery / whatever system to provide decently smooth 90W DC at 18.5 volts (thus ~4.9 amps) to a cigarette lighter adapter, I could just plug that bad boy into it. That seems easier and more efficient than generating AC for the standard wall outlet adapter or some other attempt to reverse-engineer the MagSafe protocol and electrical characteristics.

You can read a more complete background story in my SuicideWatch post if helpful: http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/fq8u3/i_cant_see_anything_positive_in_the_near_future/

So, I'm trying to take it one step at a time, focusing on the more time-sensitive matter first (post-graduation plans). I'm about to graduate soon, but I don't have any prospects in the near future as far as careers are concerned. I have 0 research &amp; internship experience. I don't know any professors either, so I have nobody to write me any sort of letter of recommendation. My GPA is not low, but it's not exactly the highest either.

After graduation I really do not want to be forced to go home (due to no job) for a multitude of reasons. On the less personal side, home is 2 hours east, so far away from Silicon Valley and not convenient if I'm trying to get/interview for an EE job/internship (I also don't own a car).

The problem is that I don't see how in the world I will end up with a job/internship compared to my competitors. I know about the background of the people that are applying to the same jobs/internships I am (extensive research experience, previous internships, incredibly high/perfect GPAs...), and I can't hold a candle to them. 

I know it's hard to get an EE job with only a B.S. (I couldn't go for the Master's since I had 0 research/internship experience and wouldn't have 1 person to write me a letter of recommendation, let alone the 3 that I see universities requiring...), but it's made worse that I'm so under-qualified (and it seems like everybody is applying for the same jobs...).

I honestly can't see myself getting a full time job or internship over my competitors. When I think about the hiring process, it really does seem nearly impossible for me to get a job/internship considering my lack of experience (and considering the experience of those I'm competing against). I mean...it's hard enough to even get that first brief interview, let alone make it to the second round for that all-day interview...and then I STILL have to come out on top for that one to get the offer! 

It's such a long road with the odds stacked against me, that I feel like just saying screw it and killing myself (I mean, I still have to find a way to deal with the loneliness of not being close with family, having little friends, and never having had a girlfriend). I have considered alternatives like the Peace Corps to take some time off, but I also need letters of recommendation for that...

I have lived here for almost three years.  The first year, I wondered why my roommate would occasionally curse and the circuit breaker covering half the apartment would trip.  Then he moved out, and I discovered the pretty (although short lived) fireworks that my new living room could make.  At one point, I deduced hot and neutral were reversed in at least one outlet.  I checked, and I was correct.

It seems to be isolated to one outlet, but when I tried to fix it I just got more sparks.  Now I am thoroughly confused.  Can anyone offer advice before I crack open the mains panel?  Is the defect deep in the walls, or just a reversed circuit breaker and a few corrected outlets?

Please note:  I do have slightly more than a basic level of understanding of physics, electricity, and safety.  My first soldering iron burn was at age 7.  I have repaired CRT devices for years, and am probably one of the youngest people to be so trained professionally.  I have wired a private home, had it inspected, and passed.

Turns out all 3 of them had different ideas of what was supposed to be implemented and how. The test data was not like the actual physical cases and the software guy just made things work that he didn't understand using the test data.

When I came in a few things worked in a few specific test cases using test (fake) data. I have been trying to get things working the way they are supposed to be working for the actual physical implementation of the project and every little fix turns into a can of worms of incorrect dependencies on bad test-data formats.

I have been tossed from person to person as they each divert accountability for explaining what is going on (thousands of lines of Python and HDL in dozens of files/modules with NO COMMENTING) so I can work on it. Now ""supervisor-guy"" has given me a deadline of 1-day to get things working or the project is scrapped (and probably my chance at continuing working for X company).

We are having power outages at work and we believe the electric company is supplying a varying amount of voltage because it is peak season (Texas - everyone is cooling their plants for packagers and engineers) which can cause a decrease of up to 10% in the 12,400V they should supply us (according to a reliable source).


A 100A fuse is blowing out on the main line each time this happens (where the voltage comes in to our facility). Why does this happen? I was hoping you could explain this to me in terms of equations V = IR and P = IV. I forget why exactly but I believe these equations change to V = I^2*R and P = I^2*V for high voltage, right?

To me it makes sense that if there is a dip in the voltage they supply to us, the transformer will also supply less voltage (&lt;110V) which will reduce the amperage our facility draws, which shouldn't cause the fuse to blow.

Mechanical here, got a few questions about exotic (to me) PCB fab materials and techniques.  I have an application that requires a hermetic feedthough to pass signals and power through a bulkhead, with one side at 1 atm and one side at HV (10^-6 torr).  Currently we use glass-sealed connectors but we need a higher pin count in a similar footprint than is readily available, and I'm considering alternative approaches.  One is to make a PCB that is itself the feedthrough.  This would consist of a small PCB with a male high density connector on one side and a female connector on the other side, and vias connecting the pads from one side to the other.  To increase the likelihood of a robust seal, the vias would either be routed so that they make a zig-zag path through the board (think blind via routed to buried via routed to blind via) or having the via go straight down to a large internal pad and back to a small via and out to a pad and back to a via.  Ultimately we are looking for a leak rate on the order of 10^-8 std cc He / sec.  Has anyone ever done something like this?  Is it a terrible idea?  Will it work for a little while until moisture driven delamination makes it fail?  I've head about hybrid fab techniques where PCBs can essentially be made from alumina or beryllia, but I don't know what to call it so I'm having a hard time with google.  Would something like this be more likely to work, or would its brittleness make it more susceptible to failure from flexure induced cracking?

I am an ME Grad, with computer science experience, who is interested in FPGAs. I'm coming from a heavy microcontroller/PC programming mentality.

I have long wanted to undergo a project with an FPGA interfaced with a PC and recently I discovered a [development board](http://www.latticesemi.com/products/developmenthardware/developmentkits/ecp3versadevelopmentkit/index.cfm) that might allow it.

At its simplist, my goal is to send data from a program in Linux across PCI Express/Gigabit Ethernet to my FPGA, implement an algorithm on said FPGA, and return the result.

The project is academic in nature, and must be ""fast."" 

I have a variety of questions to help me get perspective before I undergo this project.

**General**

* What is the process of developing for an FPGA? Is it drastically different from microcontrollers in that there is a lot of hardware simulation of the code before ever configuring the FPGA?

* Do I have to stare at Waveform Viewers till my eyes bleed, or are there other methods of debugging?

* What about in-circuit debugging once the FPGA is configured and running?

* Is it difficult to meet timing constraints?

**Lattice and IP Cores**

* I see lots of material, open cores, and community size for Altera and Xilinx. Will beginning FPGA's with Lattice shoot me in the foot, or just be a mild inconvience?

* It is my understanding that, for evaluation purposes, I can use a PCI Express or Gigabit Ethernet IP Core for free but it will only run for four hours. I am okay with that time limit, but is there more to FPGA's/Lattice/etc that I am unaware of that might come back to bite me in the butt?

* Are there cheaper ""student/academic license"" IP Cores should I want to make something more permenent?

* Are IP cores in general very expensive?

**PCI Express and Ethernet**

* How difficult is it from the software side to utilize a hardware device over PCI Express? Are there Linux drivers/libraries that will allow me to just say ""here is my buffer/packet of data, send it to this port""? Is DMA difficult?

* What about Gigabit Ethernet? Can I just send data/packets and the IP core on the board will magically decode the data?

* What happens if I cycled the power to the FPGA implementing the PCI Express end-point internally? Would that destroy the PC/Card/FPGA and so is a big ""No-no""? Would Linux/Windows just wait till it shows up again, and then say new device detected?

* Can I erase my FPGA and start over without rebooting my PC? (Meaning one state of Windows/Linux can see two or more different FPGAs over time.) This seems easier over Ethernet, something I just realized as I'm writing.

Newb here. I have been buying those cheap Chinese mini relay boards for awhile. They work great for low amperage applications. I like theyre rated at 10amps @ 240v. 

Two questions.

I've been wiring electrical outlets ground signal through the relay. The positive terminal is hooked to line voltage and the relay completes the ground. Is this an appropriate approach? (will is catch fire at some point?) the obvious alternative would be to run the positive line through the relay. Not sure if there is any practical difference

Second question. I was trying to make things a bit cheaper by using discrete components rather than a completed board. I can drive the relays just fine with an npn. Looking at the commercial boards, they have a diode and an optocoupler. Does the diode just go across the +/ - coil terminals to prevent back current?

1353408023.0,13,self.ECE,13i5e7,NMR developer here.  Help me reddit.  This seemingly simple LRC tuned circuit is crazy.  How can I make contour plots for impedance matching?,AltoidNerd,13,0,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/ECE/comments/13i5e7/nmr_developer_here_help_me_reddit_this_seemingly/,"Here is a picture of the deceptively simple tuned circuit.  One cap goes to ground, another is in series with the NMR coil:

[SCHEMATIC](http://imgur.com/jUFFn)

If I choose an RF excitation frequency (currently focusing in 25 - 42 MHz, but sometimes may want to go down to 3 MHz or as high as 80 - 100 MHz), one must tune the two air-gap variable capacitors so that the impedance is matched at 50 ohms.  That function is incredibly complicated!  To model the inductor as having a resistor in series with it, here is the mathematica code that shows the expression for the magnitude of the impedance:

[Long expression for the magnitude of the impedance, starting with admittance Y, using cs = series capacitance, cg = grounded](http://imgur.com/lBuaU)


Here is a little mathematica code that allows me to probe the function space by choosing some values.  The values I chose here are the actual measured coil series resistance and its inductance (I will post the code if you want it!):

[Mathematica slider program](http://imgur.com/Qosmz)

I'm pretty sure the code works, because the values it outputs for frequencies I have sort of memorized are pretty good.  For example, f = 30.1735 MHz, then cs ~ 10-30 pF and cg ~ 600 pF gives a good impedance. This is experimentally true.

But guys, I cannot for the life of me figure out how to characterize the space {f, cs, cg} to make the impedance matched! And it is absolutely vital that the matching is very very good, or else the weak NMR signals will not be noticed.

Sometimes in the process of NMR/NQR it is useful to do a back of the envelope calculation that tells me to check 39.8675 MHz if I see a signal at 30.8673 MHz (made up numbers)...but changing frequency is a pain in the ass, because the values of the caps greatly differ and I tune them by hand.  I don't want to go to the mathematica program I wrote - I want something faster. 

I wish I had level curves....or a contour plot.  Something like, in pseudocode,

**Plot {cs,cg} as a function of frequency such that Ztot = 50 Ohms and Im[Z]~constant**

Whatever works.  I'd like some understanding of how this circuit works, because it's being difficult.  Anything helps.  Never know RLC would be such a bitch...

I feel like I can do whatever I want, but I'm really trying to find a niche field that will keep my interest for the next few years, maybe even to pursue a PhD.  I'm trying to avoid computer engineering, controls, and information theory, though I do find those interesting.

However, the only remaining fields that I see are microelectronics, optics/photonics, and signal processing/computer vision.  The first two sound like materials science and physics in disguise.  Those sound interesting, but I'm wondering if maybe I should just change fields to Materials Science or Physics instead of EE.  Signal Processing is also interesting to me, but I'm not so hot about it.  

It would be nice to do some sort of intersection of mat. sci. and antennas, like carbon nanotube antennas.  I've looked into battery development as well, but that seems to be more along the lines of Chemistry.



Is circuit design (power amplifiers, oscillators, etc.)  even done in academia, or is that only an industry thing?  What about electrical machine design (motors, generators)?  

Or am I looking at this all wrong?
