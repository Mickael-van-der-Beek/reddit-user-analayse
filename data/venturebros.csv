2. Jonas constantly took him into dangerous situations and was indifferent to his safety, yet seemed to love him. 

3. Ben said he and Jonas saw cloning as fixing a booboo, but whose booboo? It wasn't Hank and Dean because they weren't born yet.
 
4. Rusty was strangled by Vendata, possibly to death. He remembers Vendata as a dream, and Hank remembers jumping off the roof as a dream. 

5. Rusty and the boys seem excessively sleepy in season 5. A side effect? 

6. Neither Monarch nor Rusty remember playing together as kids. Maybe because they died before their memories were recorded? (Yes, Hank remembered what happened right before he died, but only vaguely, as a dream.)

I've heard Jackson and Doc don't really have one, and the five seasons definitely haven't taken place over ten years, but let's see if we can manage.

So here's what I know:

* **1900** Guild Flashback (thanks /u/radjose)

* **1910** Founding of the Guild of Calamitous Intent

* **1959** Rad Mantle and Dragoon join the guild. (thanks /u/Cpt_Hockeyhair)

* **1961-1968** The Monarch is born. *(note 1)*

* **1964/1965** Rusty is born *(note 2)*

* **1968** Spanakopita takes place

* **1969** Major Tom dies, Brainulo trapped in the past (nineteen shitty nine)

* **1969-1976** The Monarch's parents are killed in a plane crash.

* **1972/1973** Billy Quizboy is born (16 or 17 years old in 1989)

* **1976** Venturion is constructed

* **1977** Venturion Decommissioned 

* **1978/1979** M.U.T.H.E.R. floods Jonas's underground utopia with a neurotoxin. The children touring are abandoned inside. (thanks /u/Cpt_Hockeyhair)

* **1979** Venturion returns as Vendata

* **1979/1980** Nikki Fictel Born (15 in 1995)

* **1982/1983**  Rusty begins college. *(note 2)*

* **1986** Brock attends Goodwill games (thanks /u/Cpt_Hockeyhair)

* **1987** Sphinx is defeated by OSI

* **1988-1989** Rusty loses his virginity at the age of 24, returns to the Island of Spanakopita (20 years after initial visit)

* **1989** Billy Quizboy recruited by attends State. Phantom Limb becomes a full fledged villain in the Guild. The boys are likely conceived early in this year and born shortly before November, when the fall of Berlin Wall is announced. *(see edit 2)*

* **1993** The Boys believe they are born *(see edit 2)*

* **1995** Dermott is born

* **2004** Crime o Dile dies

* **2011** End of Season 4

* **2012** End of Season 5


**Notes**: 

1. The monarch was eight when his parents died, and is within three years of Rusty's age: they attend college at the same time. This places his birth at 1961-1968, and his parents' death in 1969-1975.
Since I don't have every date reference/timeline hint memorized, share what you know and let's see how it fits.

2. Mike was inspired to study robotics after seeing Bladerunner, which helps place the date. This means Rusty would most likely be born in 1964 or 1965, making him around 13 when Venturion tried to strangle him. (1977). Any later is unlikely- he's definitely not two years old in ""Spanakopita""


EDIT: Formatting, Dermott

EDIT 2: Hank and Dean were born before the fall of the Berlin wall (before billy was recruited by the OSI) and Dean states he's 18 in ""The Devi's Grip."" As such, I'm going to assume season 5 ends in 2012, as it allows for Gary and the Monarch being familiar with the Game of Thrones TV series a year earlier in ""What Color is your Cleansuit."" This would make the boys' age discrepancy closer to 3.5 years, since they'd believe they were born in 1993. If Dermott is still 17 at the end of Season 5 his birth date is 1995, and Nikki's would be around 1979.

First: Why does Sgt Hatred have boobs? Someone please enlighten me. EDIT: I was informed this episode takes place in the middle of Season 5. I guess we'll solve The Mystery of Hatred's Tits later

Anyway, I loved this episode, not only for being funny, but also for advancing the plot.

A-plot, Haunted House: Hank and Dermott have great lines together. After this episode, Dean is the only one of the 3 to know his origins. It will be interesting to see how that plays out. (But once again, no confirmation if Myra is the boys' mother. Damn you writers!)

B-plot, Orpheus party: blackface jokes = gold. I really enjoyed all the gags about parlor tricks. Now that its been shown the Master has the ability to leave the closet, I can't wait to see what kind of shenanigans will ensue.

C-plot, Halloween bets: Here, Rusty is doing what he does best - be an unrepentant asshole. There was a small nod to Rusty now knowing he's Dermott's father, so I expect we'll see that addressed more in the upcoming season

In fact, I think they're put off by the show because they've seen things like Sg. Hatred's little problem out of context.

A. Jonas if alive, is in fact the rightful heir to the guild. (thank you for reminding me u/crookedframe)


B. The Sovereign-

-Obsessed with anonymity (as someone who had faked their own death would be)

-Not David Bowie

-Made Venturion Councilman #1 (perhaps out of regret or obligation) 

-Appeared just as Jonas Venture Sr is supposed to have ""died""

-Has access to insane super science and magic

-Has connections to the celebrities of the past (just as Jonas is seen to have had on many occasions), who he let's into the guild 

-Never really steps over the line to pure evil, or allows his Guild members to do so either. Instead is just kind of a dick. He sets up guild rules to create a safe environment for both Villains and Super Scientist, while encouraging exactly the kind conflicts Jonas Venture Sr. thrived on for years.

Help?,dr_tidbit,54,8,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1cxxe5/need_music_suggestions_for_dr_girlfriend_aerial/,"I am performing on aerial silks at a show where the theme is super heroes and villains. I have chosen Dr. girlfriend (from Venture bros) as my character, but I am finding it difficult to choose music! I love the theme song (No Vacancy – JG Thirlwell), but it is not long enough. The song should be between 3-5 mins and not toooo fast/crazy (aerial silks can be a bit slow with the wrapping sometimes). I think the speed, and space between accents (the theme song is probably the limit to speed). I am looking for either a song to put before/after the theme song (do them together as one routine) or a totally different song.
Here is some background for those curious.

Costume will be something along the lines of this (obviously with a nude suit underneat so I don’t fall out of it while flipping around upside down): https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/4462704384/h6C1F6FA1/ 

Theme song: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3B8Nrw19qEM

Previous silks routine to Pink Panther for some background of what I do: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dGQp81WFVY
I have improved my skill since then, so I want this to be a fabulous routine! Please help! =D

If suggestions are provided, I will post the routine when I perform in June!

Or B. He was cloned for the same reason they keep cloning Hank and Dean. Death prone.

My evidence? When Dean was examined in the Halloween special, the doctor that helped create the cloning technology with Dr. Venture Senior mentioned in passing ""No fetiform teratoma...""

A fetiform teratoma is a benign growth that often resembles a conjoined twin. 

He also says ""Your grandpap and I perfected genetic engineering because God or whoever gave us a perfect map to do so."", suspiciously enough.

Furthermore, Dean's baldness is genetic. If the cloning technology was in an early stage, they could have botched the process of Rusty's genome and made him genetically bald.

And I'm hoping you all can help by reminding me of any I've forgotten. Speculation about possible answers is also very welcome!

**1. Why does the Monarch hate Dr Venture?**

Monarch's ""first attempt to destroy Venture"" was in college. The event which first triggered the Monarch's hatred can't have happened much earlier than that, because he doesn't remember having been at the Venture compound as a child. Someone on reddit speculated that Jonas Venture Sr may have (inadvertently or not) caused the plane crash that killed the Monarch's parents (see also the note about Vendata below).

Edit: I also forgot to mention that there are a ton of hints that Rusty and the Monarch are actually related to each other, possibly as siblings.

Edit: In S05E07, Vendata is revealed to have been created from a human of ""unknown identity"" in the late 70s. Late in the episode, after Brock beats him up and steals much of his suit, he seems to be hallucinating: ""Where is my wife? [...] I think the plane is going down."" Is Vendata the Monarch's father?

**2. Who is Hank and Dean's mother?**

We now know for sure that Myra is not their mom. I can't think of too many other remaining female characters who would be about the right age, other than Dr Quymn, who seems never to have been intimate with Rusty before. We know he lost his virginity at 24, but we don't know who with. Could this woman be connected to the Monarch somehow?

""Dean, you have it all wrong. You have a mommy! And your dad is your dad. They made you by getting drunk and forgetting to wear a condom, like everybody else.""
- Ben, *A Very Venture Halloween*

**3. How did Jonas Venture die?**

Through the latter part of the ORB episode, it was implied that Kano had killed Jonas Venture Sr; however, he never explicitly admits to it. He says, ""I have taken from this world a great man; my silence is my penance."" But he was silent as Rusty's bodyguard long before Jonas had died. This episode also implies that even Brock doesn't know exactly how Jonas died.

One other thing to note is that when the alien impersonates Jonas at the end of ""Twenty Years to Midnight"", Rusty doesn't say ""I thought you were dead!"" His first response is to ask ""Where have you been for the past twenty years? Why haven't you contacted me?"" That seems to imply that Jonas may be missing and *presumed* dead, rather than definitely deceased.

**4. Who killed 24?**

At the end of the Season 5 finale, 21 declares that the Moppets did it, but we've never seen any evidence. It's possible that he was only using this accusation to turn the Monarch's henchmen against the Moppets and save himself from their attack. We know that the Monarch strapped the bomb to HELPeR, but the trigger was left behind on one of the thrones.

**5. Who is the sovereign, and what is he up to?**

(Credit to [crypticthree](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1k3jyj/a_list_of_unanswered_questions_up_to_the_end_of/cbl2c77).) ""We now know that the sovereign is a shape shifter, and we have not seen him in his Bowie form in a while. Has he been impersonating anyone? I really think they gave a big hint when they told us that the sovereign wasn't the real Bowie."" Also, I like [mpav432](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1k3jyj/a_list_of_unanswered_questions_up_to_the_end_of/cbl3t0p)'s suggestion below that Jonas may be the Sovereign. Can anyone else supply hints to this?

Edit: As pointed out by [tibbytime](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1k3jyj/a_list_of_unanswered_questions_up_to_the_end_of/cblr7wq), ""It's said that the Sovereign was one of the creatures on the cover to Diamond Dogs, which came out in 1972. Jonas died in the early 80's. Unless he was simultaneously living two lives for all of the 70s, I think it's highly unlikely.""

**6. Who is Rusty's mom?**

(Credit to [aeomatic](http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1k3jyj/a_list_of_unanswered_questions_up_to_the_end_of/cbl37p4).) This has been addressed much, much less than question 2. In fact, I can only dimly remember Rusty saying that she wasn't around or something. Has she ever been explicitly referred to as having died?

**7. Who are the Investors, and what are they up to?**

(Credit to a couple different people below.) We've seen more and more of them. They have worked with the Guild, but seem independent of it. They have a lot of money, but seem to also be generally evil. What's up with them?

----

What do you think? Any other big unanwswered questions? Have I gotten anything wrong? Any speculative answers?

Most of these points come from the Halloween special where it was said that Jonas helped in the perfecting of the process. There's also people saying that Rusty couldn't have built the facility because he's incompetent. And this discussion is starting up again because of the reveal that the Monarch and Rusty knew each other in some capacity as children. I don't see how Rusty could be a clone since it showed that he swallowed J.J. in vitro and J.J. has been gestating there until a couple of years ago. Consider Jonas Venture Sr.: adventurer, womanizer, scientist supreme. He saved Rusty because he was an incredibly rugged Indiana Jones type adventurer. Now consider the Doc: lazy, thrown into this life, has inadequacy issues. He couldn't save his kids every time like his father did for him. Not to mention how dim they were in the beginning seasons. I think the combination of Rusty being an alright kid to begin with, along with Jonas's hyper-competence is proof enough that Rusty is not a clone. And as for the whole cloning facility, he probably didn't build it. Jonas did a lot of stuff during his tenure as a scientist, I imagine this was left over and Rusty re-purposed it to save his sons. The Doc isn't incompetent, just lazy. As for the Monarch, I doubt he's a brother or clone but I'll hold my opinion until more evidence surfaces.

But at the beginning of the show, ol' Rusty made some pretty sweet gadgets, or at least refurbished them to get them working.

I mean check the episode ""eeny meeny, miney....magic"", Rusty manages to develop the ""Joy Can"" literally everyone's fantasy, wrapped in a nice neon metallic casing. Sure it ran off the soul of a dead orphan - but still that's damn impressive. He even built that giant robot eye (and we saw how kickass that is now that it's stuck to H.E.L.P.eR - it cut a damn whale and squid in half

Nowadays he makes things like that crappy vacuum and generally doesn't try anymore.

I still kinda wish he went the route of a villain, he is a super genius, but only when he uses unorthodox methods - making mutants, hell bent on destruction, mutating angry insectoid woman, general impressive weaponry.

**Bonus Edit Question**: I was watching some old episode and getting myself back into the series. And the whole Twin thing got me thinking, it seems like its a dominant gene in the venture bloodline, Rusty had a twin (albeit living inside him), He also had twins of his own, plus there was that whole thing about Quim being related to Rusty somehow and her having twins. Was it shown anywhere if the original Jonas Venture had a twin brother?  Just curious.

Supervillians have the money, power, and charisma to raise an army. They have incredible weapons, ranging from ray guns, to biological monsters.

When Gathers and the ex-OSI were first revealed to be operating out of the Venture compound, I just figured that they had all of the old Sphinx stuff moved into one of the semi-abandoned buildings, and were just sort of squatting. 

But if the Commander and the others had their old costumes (including the Countess's strength suit) hidden in a back room, then that means that the original Sphinx was already there at least at the end of the Pyramid Wars in 1987. 

Did Jonas Sr. let Sphinx set up shop in the compound? Huh. Maybe they moved in right after he ""died."" Did we ever get a year on when he died?

Cloning, obviously, but who did he clone?

As the episodes progressed we saw that Jonas wasn't that good a father and was willing to put Rusty into very dangerous situations, just as Rusty does with his boys.
Rusty wasn't too worried about the boys lives because he has replacements.



But did Jonas have replacements for Rusty?

Whenever opportunities for adventure pop up, he's been seeing rejecting them. The obvious thing most people would say is that he's just being emo and such but I don't think that's the case.

In Spanakopita, Dean begs off the yearly vacation, saying he's got things to do. Combine that with the mysterious wounds he has on his arms, and I get the feeling that no matter how much Dean hates it, he's spending his efforts on super science in a part of the compound.

Maybe it'll pay off in the season finale when it's revealed that Dean's created an army of killbots because he had nothing better to do with his time or he's been perfecting his dream of being a boy reporter.

Killinger himself even says that Rusty can't be successful without a strong staff (""The Doctor is Sin"").

The bulk of Jonas' fortune seems to in fact come from monetizing the Rusty Venture show either directly or by filling it with advertisements for Venture Rex cigarettes and other projects. Jonas certainly had a strong share of military contracts, but it seems like it was never his priority (similar to how Steve Jobs used to have favorite projects and leave the rest of the company to other executives). 

Rusty, meanwhile, seems to be subsisting himself almost entirely on scientific research; while he's doing a mediocre at best job of it, he and his sons are doing the entire workload personally. Rusty's main weakness seems to be not inheriting his father's flair for marketing.

When Jonas Jr. was building Gargantua-2, he outsourced a huge amount of the project in Jonas Sr. fashion, never paying attention until it was a few weeks from delivery date.

Born with crippled arms, he invents a machine that will enhance them. Then, with the help of Billy Quizboy, he accidentally gives himself powers. In this scene we can clearly see he is connected to the machine by his arms and legs.

However, it is heavily implied throughout the show that his penis is also invisible.

""Tears!? Come on! You know that sick deformed freak! You know he was pounding his invisible meat!"" - the Monarch

Plus the fact that we see the Alchemist pick something up, and slide it into his robe, which is heavily implied to be an invisible penis.

So this all implies that after the accident that destroyed his machine, he built another with an altered design, in order to enhance his penis. Was his penis crippled at birth too, or was this merely a little extra self esteem boost? Can he kill with it?

In Pomp and Circuitry it is revealed to us that Phantom Limb can control his appendages when they're not attached to him (that is what happened right? He used his invisible detached limbs to move his inanimate object friends?) What does this mean for the alchemist? Did Phantom Limb at some point summon his penis, mentally guiding it through a daring escape, and a long dangerous trek home, inch-worming its way over streets and through rivers, possible in the cold or the rain, until they were reunited? Did he try to exact any revenge on the alchemist? Did poor Al get chased around his apartment by a killer invisible penis? If he can control his detached limbs, can he also feel them? Did Al attempt any racy activities with the poor little guy?

And now we've seen that Phantom Limb, now Revenge, has his limbs back, by the help of Dr. Impossible. Were they regenerated or reattached? Has his penis been regenerated as well? Is it still trapped in Al's apartment (or he lives with Dr. Orpheus now?) Is the Phantom Limb we know and love still a eunuch?
These are the questions that keep me up at night.


*edit
And if the penis was regenerated, does he now have the sensation and awareness of two penises? Can he have sex with two women at once? Could the process be repeated, allowing him to have a near infinite number of penises?

When the Monarch steals that cleansuit and comes to see Gary, and Gary just wants nothing to do with him all the while the Monarch is convinced he is still loyal to him and merely playing undercover. 

At the very end of that scene Monarch asks him a question about game of thrones and Gary answers very non-chalant as if they have had this conversation before and the Monarch just smiles and says something like, ""good, good, just checking"".

Even if he was starting to falter in his belief Gary was still loyal, his extreme narcissism coupled with the denial he is going through made him believe that after asking that question, Gary is in fact still loyal because he answered the question in the way he would have when he was still loyal.

Now to any well adjusted human being this simply means that Gary is still the same person underneath whatever uniform he wears, but the Monarch has no concept for that since everyone in his life (sans Dr. Mrs. the Monarch) is disposable and ultimately replaceable.

What will happen?  Any reveals?  Any plot lines?

Here's mine:

1. 21 is going to find out that the monarch killed 24 (see the shallow gravy ep for the monarch's confession) and now he has left the monarch will either arch him or try to kill him.  His romantic interest with Dr. Girlfriend will feature in this too. (edit: don't forget the monarch added his name to 21's list.  He goes back to get his stuff.. and then what?)

2. We will see more of ben and find out that Dr. venture is a clone, like hank and dean.  When ben is examining dean he comments that he seems to be free of ""fetiform teratoma"" - exactly what jonas venture junior was (this was also said when the audience could clearly hear it rather than in the blurry parts at the start - why was it given such prominence?).  Is this a common thing with clones you should check?  Why did ben repeatedly say he worked with Jonas Sr. on this, when we never heard this before and rusty has said the clones were ""*his* life's work""?  (edit, and ben thinking it odd rusty never mentioned him) I think these were deliberate hints of that.

3.  We'll see more of ""new hank"" and new dean.  I know that's kinda obvious, but they clearly have developed in the time between seasons.  Hank will eventually work for sphinx/osi.  Dean, I have no idea.  But we will see the differences between them and the more flat characters they were - season 4 was great for developing them loads and looking forward to more.

4. Maybe learn about Jonas venture Sr.?

",Gold_Leaf_Initiative,34,7,47,http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/14ot2j/how_does_dr_jonas_venture_rationalize_leaving_all/,"This is the episode where they find a bomb shelter underneath the compound.  They also discover that Jonas venture was simultaneously developing nuclear warheads, as well as an automated bomb shelter.  Both systems were controlled by an A.I. named M.U.T.H.E.R. and apparently Jonas did not design a system that even he himself could manually override.

MUTHER goes crazy and gasses the facility.  Kato, Action Man, and Col. Gentleman along with about 10 children are going crazy and having hallucinations.  Dr. Venture rallies and saves the 3 members of his team, who have to ACTIVELY WALK PAST LITTLE KIDS to get out.  They do succeed in getting out, and then they seal up the base with the children still inside.


1) Why didn't Jonas manually override or reprogram Muther once he was back topside?  He just unplugged her and left her programming in state.

2) Why was MUTHER programmed to launch all her nukes if Dr. Venture is not present?  What kind of insane idea is that?

3) Why didn't Dr. Venture ever save the children?  I knew he was amoral, but that's downright evil, he left them down there to die.  


Insane episode.  Makes me want to know more about VEN-TECH defense systems.  Jonas really was incerdibly influential on the worldwide scale, he defined warfare during the time he was alive.

One of the biggest things I noticed through out the entirety of the show is that things change, a lot! Most characters have gone through major developments ie; career changes, body modifications, gender changes, etc. 

Some examples;
Brock: going from body guard to sphinx operative now to OSI operative.
Sgt Hatred: went from bad guy to archenemy to body guard to growing tits.
Hank &amp; Dean: innocent young adventurers, died, cloned, no longer ""immortal"", Hank ""almost"" sphinx, ""almost"" OSI and always batman, Dean struggling with self awareness and rebellious ""goth"" or ""emo"" young scientist.
Henchman 21: Fat, nerdy, barely useful henchman, looses best friend, struggles with ghost of dead friend, gets buff, becomes ruthless top henchman, has a breakdown, leaves the monarch, ""joins"" sphinx, sphinx dismantles, tries to revive as leader.

I could go on and on.

The characters that have changed the least has been Dr. Venture and Jonas Jr. 

Yet, with all of these major developments and changes to the family dynamics, the show is just as good, if not better than the start of the show. My hat is off to you Christopher McCulloch, Doc Hammer, and everyone else who has made this show one of the best on television.

Note Steppenwolf says he built it in '66 which is when the original Munsters show ended.

I'm curious about Steppenwolf though, since he doesn't look like a wolf or coyote to me.

The character to me strongly resembles [Man-Bat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-Bat) (a DC villain) visually ...so the name could just be referencing [Steppenwolf](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_%28comics%29), another DC villain. The goggles and smoking jacket would then just be to fit the Munsters theme.

I think this is pretty likely because there are many characters who are an amalgam. However, given the number of literary/film references in the show, the Hermann Hesse novel is another possibility for the origin of the name... especially the trippy [1974 film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072206/). Or even the rock band, which was named after the novel.

He could also be based visually on some other character I've never seen, and the name is some reference to that. I'd be curious to hear any other ideas.",,False,self,t5_2r8d8,1373977258.0,,,True,t3_1iene6,http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1iene6/steppenwolf/,

1.What is your name and what do you do?

Christopher McCulloch, alias Jackson Publick. I created The Venture Bros. animated series, which I write, direct and produce. Doc Hammer also writes scripts for the show.

2.How did you come up with the idea of Venture Brothers?

There wasn't really any specific moment of inspiration, but I came up with Hank and Dean Venture probably seven years ago. They didn't really have any personalities yet--I think they even had different names (Lunk and Dale, respectively, if I'm not mistaken)--they were just two idiot kids who talked like Scooby Doo or Leave it to Beaver characters and maybe solved adventures. I was looking at a lot of old boys' adventure novels from the 1950's &amp; 60's at the time--stuff like Tom Swift--and I was just goofing on that and my vague memories of the old Jonny Quest cartoons. I tucked them away in my notebook and would think about them little by little over the following years, eventually adding their father and Brock to the cast as I moved the idea closer to a parody of Jonny Quest. Basically I'd start by subverting the expectations of any character you'd find in a straight adventure cartoon from that time period. Slowly the characters developed their own personalities separate from the direct parody I was perpetrating. Eventually, after several years of not really developing them full time, I had enough scattered notes and concepts to try to write a comic book story about them. I publish an anthology of underground comics called Monkeysuit with some friends of mine. But at that time it had been so long since I'd drawn any comics that I didn't think my artistic skills were up to snuff to really do the story justice the way I saw it in my head, so I held off for another year and kept adding more and more notes to my notebook.  The next time we were gettting ready to publish an issue of Monkeysuit my art had improved but my story was now too long for the ten or twelve pages I'd been assigned.  So I started another story...and that one got too long, too.  Now I had a folder of sketches, a notebook full of ideas and a stack of index cards with bits of dialogue on them, so I cobbled it all together into what would become the pilot episode script of The Venture  Bros. cartoon.

3.What was the most enjoyable part of this season of Venture Brothers?

I assume you mean the most enjoyable part of the process of making the show, as opposed to what my favorite episode is or something like that.  The most purely enjoyable part is the first step of the writing process--when I or Doc and I are just shooting ideas around, coming up with initial concepts, yelling in character and developing jokes and dialogue.  That's the point when you're just doing it because it's fun and because your mind's racing, so it's purely creative with no restrictions, no expectations, and really no effort.  When you actually have to turn it into a script, it becomes work--you have to make the story make sense, you have to keep it to a specific time, you have to edit yourself, etc.  But writing's still fun and enjoyable...there's just a little more pressure there.  The same goes for all phases of production, really. When you're first starting to talk about the storyboards it's exciting because you're only just beginning to imagine what the episode will look like.  Then comes the hard part of drawing it, of editing it, etc.  Recording the voices is fun when you're yelling into a microphone and you're cracking each other up but it's also tedious because you're trying to get a line just right and you're there with a sound engineer who's waiting for you to stop goofing around. Even editing is fun because you're getting the episode into shape and you're finally seeing and hearing it as it's meant to be, but it's also a drag because it's a time consuming process and you can't help but feel a little depressed about it because it's the last time you'll ever get to touch it--your last chance to make it what you want to be and you're already stuck with whatever animation you got back from Korea.  

4.How many voices do you do for the show roughly?

I do two of the main characters: Hank Venture and The Monarch.  I also do Pete White (who sounds like my dad) and one of the Monarch's henchmen (who sounds like Ray Romano) who both show up pretty frequently. We have a lot of characters who only show up in one or two episodes but have big parts and I did some of those: Roy Brisby, The Pirate Captain, Colonel Genltleman and The Action Man.  We always have a lot of little supporting characters--guards, doctors, henchmen, etc.--who only have one or two lines and I do a lot of those voices, too.

5.Are any of the characters refrences to any other cartoons or movies?

A lot of them are.  Heck, most of them are in some way or another.  Some are more direct parodies than others, though. Characters like The Monarch and Baron Ünderbheit are homages to the kinds of villains you'd see in old Marvel comics but they're not really parodies of anyone specific--they're more archetypical. But we've done parodies (or, as I like to see them, homages) to the Six Million Dollar Man, Walt Disney, The Right Stuff, John Woo movies, Fargo, Heavy Metal, The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Easy Rider, James Bond, Panic Room, and dozens of others. Not to mention passing references to real world rock stars and toys and games and books.  We even got to actually use Race Bannon from the Jonny Quest cartoons (because Cartoon Network owns those).  We killed him, of course.

6.When and What is Venture Brothers on?

The Venture Bros. is on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block of programming.  It's on Saturday nights at 11:30pm and Monday through Wednesday nights at midnight.

1374797306.0,19,self.venturebros,1j2blq,The Certainties of Venture Bros. Cloning,WhaleConnoisseur,23,4,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/venturebros/comments/1j2blq/the_certainties_of_venture_bros_cloning/,"Here is what we are certain about cloning (including a little about Hank and Dean's history as it pertains 
to their cloning). Add, or correct, any information as needed: 
	
**""The Incredible Mr. Brisby""**

-Mr. Brisby, aware that Jonas Sr. was ""dabbling"" in cloning, wants all his research notes on cloning to continue his existence. Rusty denies that he kept any notes. 
	Question: How was Brisby aware of this information even if the O.S.I. was not at this point?   
-This is the first mention of the cloning technology.  

**""Powerless in the Face of Death""** 

-It is revealed that the boys are clones and have died 15 times before, and Rusty keeps many duplicates of them on hand. 
-The learning beds record their memories and put them into their cloned bodies. 
-Brock has been aware of the cloning for some time.
-They come out pink, and lack communication and movement skills.
-Orpheus becomes aware that they are clones.

**""The Buddy System""**

-Rusty clones a child at his day camp and removes the cancer from his DNA: ""they'll thank me after they re-potty-train him"".
-Questionable: Supposedly the child would have no past memories due to the recorded memories not supplied.  

**""The Family That Slays Together Stays Together Part I""** 

-Hank tells Le Tueur that he once dressed up like Batman and jumped off the roof but thinks it might have been a dream. The death montage in ""Powerless in the Face of Death"" shows it did happen.
-Therefore, clones can possibly have memories of their deaths. Questionable: This shouldn't seem possible due to their memories being transferred due to the learning beds.  

**""The Family That Slays Together Stays Together Part II/ Blood of the Father, Heart of Steel""** 
(adding these together for the sake of saving room)

-During an O.S.I vs Monarch battle the clone slugs are released to fight, the clones then die.
-Because of the battle many more people request/ demand their own clones: Gary wanting a clone of 24, Nazis wanting a Hitler clone. 
-The O.S.I., now aware that Rusty is capable of cloning, are ""on his case"". He is now unable to clone the boys if they die.  

**""Perchance to Dean""**

-A flash-back shows a deformed Dean clone being aborted. Therefore some times the clones will not be 100% perfect but will have some mutations. 
-Also, shown during the flashback there is an entire large room devoted to cloning, with many tanks.  
-The clone was able to survive for a long period of time on its own. 

**""The Better Man""**

-The Master is aware that Dean is a clone, and tells Triana that he has been cloned many times.  

**""The Diving Bell Vs. The Butter-Glider""**

-While in Dr. Venture they see the corpses of the 7th Hank and Dean. 

**""A Very Venture Halloween""**

-Dean meets Ben and learns that he has been cloned multiple times. 
-Ben has worked with Jonas Sr, and together they perfected genetic engineering, according to Ben.
-Ben says to an upset Dean that ""Jonas, [Ben], and yes [Rusty], saw it as nothing more than a fucking band-aid for a really big boo-boo."" 
-Jonas must have performed some type of trial, though nothing can be confirmed. 
-Ben also says that Dean has a real mother: he was the result of ""getting drunk and forgetting to wear a condom, just like everybody else"" (or something to that extent).   
-Reco/ Rico= Recombinant Lusus Naturae. Recombinant DNA: DNA sequences that result from the use of laboratory methods (molecular cloning) to bring together genetic material from multiple sources, creating sequences that would not otherwise be found in biological organisms. Lusus Naturae: a freak, mutant, or monster.

**""Mama's Boys""**

-The boys learn that Myra is not their real mother, and are still unaware who it is. 

**""The Devil's Grip""**

-Dean tells Hank that they are both clones. Hanks reacts very well to the news and sees himself as the Highlander, reassuring Dean. 

In summation, the only ones we can be sure are clones are Hank and Dean. 
At this point we cannot be completely certain that any other characters are clones (Rusty, Monarch, etc.) 
we can really only make guesses and theories. Jonas and Ben have most likely created a clone based on Ben saying that they both have ""perfected genetic engineering"" and saw it as a ""band-aid"", but no concrete proof 
has been supplied. There are still a few questions: the vague memories of their deaths, which would not seem fitting the idea that the learning beds supply the recorded memories to the new clone bodies.

It could just be a new costume, but perhaps Jonas Sr. had worn the costume himself at some point for the Guild if the GCI/Sovereign connection were to be true, and since it was Killinger's intentions to sign Rusty into the Guild, maybe Jonas Sr. sent Killinger because he wanted to give Rusty a chance at becoming successful and leaving behind his failures.

Regarding the connection between Jonas Sr. and The Monarch's parents, I'm thinking that while they must have been good friends once, they may have eventually been on opposite sides, with Jonas Sr. possibly arching the Monarch's parents, leading up to the plane crash and the Monarch's hatred for Rusty, eventually joining the organization possibly being led by the very man responsible for his parents' deaths in this twisted quest for revenge.

Are Mol and Monstroso really dead? Until I see bodies I'm presuming alive...

Were those all the Blackhearts, are there more to get revenge? Anyone remember seeing a larger number of them in other episodes?

Will we ever see 24 again, and what was he? The fact that he talked to the montroso henchman after death, without 21 seeing it, seems to suggest he's real (38 was it?). 

Was there something wrong with Mol and Monstroso's relationship? He did state that he never found a woman to satisfy him...

Any chance Hank has lingering memories of his sexy experience? He included Dermott in the ""Go Team Venture!"" and he asked the postwoman to be his date, ignoring the younger and presumably closer Nikki Fictel, but maybe thats just because he's afraid of her.

Anything else?

So if the whores were actually blackhearts, then why does Mol threaten the whore Brock enters the sphinx headquarters with? Could she have been bluffing?

The only shape-shifters in the entire series that we are aware of so far (please correct me if I'm wrong) are: The Sovereign, The Master, The Investors, and the [Jonas Venture Alien.](http://venturefans.org/vbwiki/Jonas_Venture_Alien) I'm going to ignore the Alien because I think he was just a reference to Contact, and doesn't have to do with anything else.

In ""O.S.I. Love You"", the Investors showed up shortly after Brock questions Monstroso about The Sovereign and the Guild. This leads me to believe they have something to do with them. Perhaps they are the Sovereign's right hand men or something.

That leaves The Sovereign and The Master themselves. At first, I thought that maybe they were the same person. Both powerful magical shapeshifters, and we don't know what either of them truly look like. However, the one thing that keeps me from thinking this is the fact that no matter what The Master's form, he always has the same voice (H Jon Benjamin). And Bowie-Sovereign doesn't have that voice.

So now, I'm thinking that they are rivals. Perhaps the same species?
