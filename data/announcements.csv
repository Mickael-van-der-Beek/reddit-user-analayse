1321427616.0,5455,self.announcements,me5e9,American Censorship Day - Stand up for ████ ███████ ,reddit,34111,28656,3170,http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/me5e9/american_censorship_day_stand_up_for/,"reddit,

Today, the US House Judiciary Committee has a hearing on the [Stop Online Piracy Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Online_Piracy_Act) or SOPA. The text of the bill is [here](http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/pdf/112%20HR%203261.pdf). This bill would strengthen copyright holders' means to go after allegedly infringing sites at detrimental cost to the freedom and integrity of the Internet. As a result, we are joining forces with organizations such as the EFF, Mozilla, Wikimedia, and the FSF for [American Censorship Day](http://americancensorship.org/).

Part of this act would undermine the [safe harbor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor) provisions of the [Digital Millenium Copyright Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) which would make sites like reddit and YouTube liable for hosting user content that may be infringing. This act would also force search engines, DNS providers, and payment processors to cease all activities with allegedly infringing sites, in effect, walling off users from them.

This bill sets a chilling precedent that endangers everyone's right to freely express themselves and the future of the Internet. If you would like to voice your opinion to those in Washington, please consider [writing your representative](https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml) and the sponsors of this bill:

As you may have noticed, the site is back up and running. There are still a few things moving pretty slowly, but for the most part the site functionality should be back to normal.

For those curious, here are some of the nitty-gritty details on what happened:

This morning around 8am PST, the entire site suddenly ground to a halt. Every request was resulting in an error indicating that there was an issue with our memcached infrastructure. We performed some manual diagnostics, and couldn't actually find anything wrong.

With no clues on what was causing the issue, we attempted to manually restart the application layer. The restart worked for a period of time, but then quickly spiraled back down into nothing working. As we continued to dig and troubleshoot, one of our memcached instances spontaneously rebooted. Perplexed, we attempted to fail around the instance and move forward. Shortly thereafter, a second memcached instance spontaneously became unreachable.

Last night, our hosting provider had applied some patches to our instances which were eventually going to require a reboot. They notified us about this, and we had planned a maintenance window to perform the reboots far before the time that was necessary. A postmortem followup seems to indicate that these patches were not at fault, but unfortunately at the time we had no way to quickly confirm this.

With that in mind, we made the decision to restart each of our memcached instances. We couldn't be certain that the instance issues were going to continue, but we felt we couldn't chance memcached instances potentially rebooting throughout the day.

Memcached stores its entire dataset in memory, which makes it extremely fast, but also makes it completely disappear on restart. After restarting the memcached instances, our caches were completely empty. This meant that every single query on the site had to be retrieved from our slower permanent data stores, namely Postgres and Cassandra.

Since the entire site now relied on our slower data stores, it was far from able to handle the capacity of a normal Wednesday morn. This meant we had to turn the site back on very slowly. We first threw everything into read-only mode, as it is considerably easier on the databases. We then turned things on piece by piece, in very small increments. Around 4pm, we finally had all of the pieces turned on. Some things are still moving rather slowly, but it is all there.

We still have a lot of investigation to do on this incident. Several unknown factors remain, such as why memcached failed in the first place, and if the instance reboot and the initial failure were in any way linked.

In the end, the infrastructure is the way we built it, and the responsibility to keep it running rests solely on our shoulders. While stability over the past year has greatly improved, we still have a long way to go. We're very sorry for the downtime, and we are working hard to ensure that it doesn't happen again.

cheers,

alienth

tl;dr

Bad things happened to our cache infrastructure, requiring us to restart it completely and start with an empty cache. The site then had to be turned on very slowly while the caches warmed back up. It sucked, we're very sorry that it happened, and we're working to prevent it from happening again.

[[screenshot](http://www.reddit.com/help/toolbar)]

It's especially useful when opening a bunch of links up in background tabs, solving the issue of ""Why did I open [this random picture](http://www.reddit.com/tb/eohp9) two hours ago?""

It's also turned out to be a good de facto reddit shortlink system. Instead of having to pass around this mouthful:

    http://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/em5zw/father_and_son_launch_an_hd_camera_and_an_iphone/

You can just use the toolbar link:

    http://reddit.com/em5zw

This is what the ""share"" button has always done, by the way (have you ever tried it?) Your friend gets a link to the toolbar version, and this way they can see the content, the headline and, should they desire to go exploring, a way to get to the comments. Ideally this will lead them to create an account, and thus reddit moves one step closer to world domination.

Anyway, the reason we're writing about all this today is that we've acquired the domain `redd.it`, shaving a few characters off our shortlinks and bringing them down to a size where we can put them in the sidebar. (Do you see this submission's shortlink up there on the right?)

    FAQ:
    Q1. Is reddit entering the URL shortening business?
    A1. No. We just acquired a cool domain and wanted to show it off.

Note for adblockers: If you made an exception for reddit the simple way (by clicking the stop sign and saying ""Disable on reddit.com""), that'll apply to every link you visit in the toolbar. If you only want to make an exception within reddit, and keep adblock on for external sites viewed inside the toolbar frame, you should instead set things up as described in [/help/adblock](/help/adblock).

We'll end with a protip that, for whatever reason, not a lot of people know about. Skip it if you're easily confused: 

If you're on an external site, and you want to wrap the reddit toolbar around it, you can just prepend ""redd.it/"" to the existing URL. For example, if you're visiting a hot new search engine at `http://www.google.com`, just change that to `redd.it/http://www.google.com` (I know it looks funny, but go with it), and you'll be taken to the reddit page for that URL. If it's not already on reddit, you'll be taken to a prefilled submission page.",,False,self,t5_2r0ij,True,,,True,t3_eorhm,http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/eorhm/reddit_30_less_typing/,admin

So what happened?  We do not actually control the ad box on the right -- that is outsourced to a company called DART.  We share an account with the rest of Conde, so multiple people have access to this.  Someone accidentally put in the wrong ad for the wrong site, and you saw the result.

If you turn AdBlock off, you will see that we have disabled the box ad and replaced it with something else until we can find out what happened and make sure it doesn't happen again.

However, blaming problems on a third party just isn't our style.  We take full responsibility for this failure, and apologize profusely.

In the coming days, we will be adding some additional safety measures to the ad box to make sure this never happens again.

Initial indications are that the load balancer went down.  We don't use Amazon's load balancer, we use haproxy on our own instance.

Normally such a thing would cause our web monitoring software to freak out and wake us all up, but unfortunately it looks like that *also* went down at some point (that isn't on EC2 at all).

Again, apologies for the inconvenience.

**EDIT:**  Here's the post mortem.  It looks like we were hit by a bug similar to [this Ubuntu bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/276476).  As you can see, the bug was fixed in a later version of the kernel.  However, the way EC2 works, we can't upgrade the kernel ourselves.  What I can do is switch to a new base image, but I hadn't, mostly because there were always higher priority things to do, and it was never really a problem before.

As for the monitoring, it looks like our monitoring server experienced a power failure sometime yesterday, and the UPS failed, and then it failed to reboot cleanly.

So what are we doing to fix the problem and prevent this type of failure in the future?

Right now we are still a bit degraded, but we have enough servers to handle the weekend traffic (we think).  We hope to be at full capacity by Monday.

We want to tell you why reddit was down.

In short, Amazon had a failure of their EBS system, which is a data storage product they offer, at around 1:15am PDT.  This may sound familiar, because it was the same type of failure that took us down a month ago. This time however the failure was more widespread and affected a much larger portion of our servers (and not just ours, many other companies were affected as well).  Namely, most of our database slaves were disabled from this outage. Even though we are spread across multiple availability zones (data centers), it did us no good in this case, since the outage was so widespread and hit multiple availability zones.

Since that last failure, we have been doing everything we can to move ourselves off of the EBS product.  We're about half way there.  All of our Cassandra nodes are now using only local disk, and we hope to have all of postgres on local disk soon.

We will continue to use Amazon's other services as we have been.  They have some work to do on the EBS product, and they are aware of that and working on it.  The other services that we use are still performing as expected.

That being said, if you work for another hosting platform and believe you can make a compelling offering, please contact us at hosting@reddit.com, and we'll get back to you in a few days.

The team and I have been up the last two nights waiting for this issue to get fixed on the Amazon side so that we could bring the site up as soon as possible.  Because of this, we probably won't be around much to answer questions in the comments here, but feel free to talk amongst yourselves.  :)

As always, thank you all for your continued support.  And to whoever sent us a pizza, thank you!  It was much appreciated.

To end on a high note, I'd just like to mention that we are making excellent progress on the hiring front to bring on some new developers to help us implement long term fixes.

**What will we be doing?**  We will be performing part two of the maintenance we started [three weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/tb/amumr).  We will be upgrading memcached and memcachedb, and their supporting system libraries.  It turns out we are two major revisions behind, and we'd like to take advantage of some of the new improvements, like the binary protocol.

**Why?** We hope this will further enhance site performance, and make page load times even faster!

**I thought you are ""in the cloud"".  Why can't you do it with no downtime?**  The cloud is not a magic bullet, and we are cheap and lazy.  We could in theory bring up a bunch of new machines that are already upgraded to replace the machines we will be upgrading, but it turns out that moving the data would be a big pain.  So instead we will just take the site down for a bit to do the upgrade in place.

The beauty of the cloud, however, is that we'll have a backup instance already booted and configured if something goes wrong.

**Ok, but why do you have to take the site down?**  One of the things that we are upgrading are the permacaches, which use memcachedb (see previous blog post).  Because of the way we access them, they are currently a single point of failure for us.  We hope to resolve that in the future, but in the meantime, we can't take one of them down without breaking the site, so we'll just take them all down at once.  

**Fun fact**:  Since we took the site down 3 weeks ago, page views are already up about 15%  Lesson:  Site faster == more traffic :)

1284515457.0,1536,self.announcements,ddz0s,reddit wants your permission to use your data for research to build some new features!,ketralnis,2193,657,897,http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/ddz0s/reddit_wants_your_permission_to_use_your_data_for/,"One of reddit's greatest strengths is the huge collection of niche communities and categories of content that we have. One of our greatest weaknesses is that most of it never makes it to the front page. So many vast, undiscovered communities. I mean, just look at my own list of favourites:

[programming](/r/programming), [technology](/r/technology), [comics](/r/comics), [math](/r/math), [Python](/r/Python), [coding](/r/coding), [linguistics](/r/linguistics), [haskell](/r/haskell), [robotics](/r/robotics), [answers](/r/answers), [electronics](/r/electronics), [StandUpComedy](/r/StandUpComedy), [ideasfortheadmins](/r/ideasfortheadmins), [ECE](/r/ECE), [emacs](/r/emacs), [reddithax](/r/reddithax), [Coffee](/r/Coffee), [sanfrancisco](/r/sanfrancisco), [erlang](/r/erlang), [bayarea](/r/bayarea), [chrome](/r/chrome), [redditdev](/r/redditdev), [systems](/r/systems), [artificial](/r/artificial), [compscipapers](/r/compscipapers), [algorithms](/r/algorithms), [macapps](/r/macapps), [horseporn](/r/random ""good catch""), [arduino](/r/arduino), [operabrowser](/r/operabrowser), [SketchComedy](/r/SketchComedy), [golang](/r/golang), [kindle](/r/kindle), [smallprog](/r/smallprog), [robot](/r/robot), [Esperanto](/r/Esperanto), [avr](/r/avr), [hadoop](/r/hadoop), [cassandra](/r/cassandra), [colorblindness](/r/colorblindness), [android](/r/android), [england](/r/england), [BSD](/r/bsd)

We have loads and loads of these communities, some very tiny, but they just aren't very discoverable. I think that helping people find this stuff is a problem worth solving, and so do plenty of researchers and grad students that have contacted us asking for this data (that we've historically had to turn away). There's lots of [research](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netflix_Prize) out there on this kind of problem that we'd like to participate in. There's our [JSON API](http://www.reddit.com/.json), but that's just not enough for the in-depth analysis that we'd like to do and allow researchers to do.

We feel that opening up users' private data to researchers like that has to be done very carefully, and always with the permission of the users affected. So I'd like to announce that, from now on, we're going to share all your private data with DARPA. No, just kidding. Today we're adding a **new [preference](/prefs)** under ""privacy options"" called ""allow my data to be used for research purposes"". **By ticking that box you're agreeing to allow us to include certain data about you in big data dumps** like [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/bubhl/csv_dump_of_reddit_voting_data/). This is **optional and opt-in**.

We want to make sure that everyone understands *exactly* what ticking that box will do. The data that you're giving us permission to reveal are:

* Your [community subscriptions](/reddits/mine)
* Your list of [friends](/prefs/friends) **edit1** none of *their* data, just that you friended them **edit2** only friends that have *also* opted in would be listed
* Non-content information about private reddits that you post in (that is, we may share *that* you posted there, but not *what* you posted)
* Your browser's user-agent
* Information on spam reports that you've filed (the `report` button)

On a separate tickbox, you can also share your voting history so that people can see your `liked` and `disliked` pages (this has been there since 2005). Either of these tickboxes will mean that you give us permission to share this voting data. Some items we're considering but want to talk to you about are:

* The last time you visited reddit at the time of the data-dump (in general this can be approximated from your last vote)
* The first two octets of your IP address (that is, if you're at 1.2.3.4, we may reveal that you're at 1.2.x.x)
* A [one-way hash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) of your email address **edit** looks like this one's out, lots of people seem uncomfortable with it

**Please tell us if you think that any of these are going too far**, especially if you'd tick the box but for one or two of the data involved.

If we ever change or add to this list, we'll reset everyone back to the default of `off` (and/or implement a more granular set of research-related preferences), so you don't have to worry about us sneaking things in there while you're asleep. **You're not agreeing to let us start telling everyone about every link you click or anything like that without your knowledge**. You are not agreeing to let us share the actual content of your private reddits, and **if you do not tick the preference we will not share this data against your will**. This is for research dumps. We're not going to be fielding requests for data about individual users. We're not trying to share identifiable information and in the general case we'll try to keep you anonymous but we all know that [that doesn't always work](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL_search_data_scandal) which is why this is **optional and opt-in**. Did I mention that this is **optional and opt-in**?

Our goal isn't just to get a bunch of data out there, but to use this data to *make reddit better*. We want features like hyper-local communities and recommendations. And we want you guys to [help us](/r/redditdev) shape those features, but to do so and attract interested researchers we need lots and lots of data for analysis.
