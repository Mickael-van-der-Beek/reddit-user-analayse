His wife is 40 weeks pregnant, and they have no insurance. They need our help! Please Reddit! (Posted in assistance also)",gweebah,453,58,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/x066f/my_best_friend_caleb_was_shot_in_the_face_during/,"My name is Michael West, and I am close friends to Caleb Medley and his wife Katie. I was planning to go up to Denver to visit them on Monday, the 23rd and be there for Katie’s induction and birth of their first child Hugo. I was very excited and could not wait to finally be able to go up and visit them for the first time since they both moved to Denver 9 months ago to pursue their dreams. Caleb is a comedian in the early stages of his carrier, and moved to Denver with his wife Katie for better job opportunities and to have better chances of making it big as a professional standup comedian. Katie, who I have known since I was 4 years old, is well on her way to being a veterinarian technician like she has always wanted. She is currently still in her program, but should be graduating in 1 ½ years. Caleb and Katie started dating in high school in their senior year October 31st, 2007 and got married October 31st, 2010 up in the mountains with only family and close friends. I was one of Caleb’s grooms’ men, along with his two younger brothers Seth and Jon. From when they started dating, you could just tell that out of everyone in the world, these two were meant for each other, and at the wedding, you knew it was official, and they would be happily married for eternity. They have been inseparable since that beautiful morning in the mountains, and their love has only grown for each other since. 9 months ago, they decided that it was time to start a family. Katie is now 40 weeks pregnant and was scheduled to be induced on Monday so they can finally meet their little boy, Hugo. Yes, they found the name from the guy from Lost, but it is a very appropriate name. They love the show, and Caleb kind of looks like Hugo in my opinion.

On Thursday night, at the midnight premiere of the new Batman movie, Caleb and his wife and a few friends went to go see the new movie. They were all very excited and huge batman fans; they were all dressed in their favorite batman memorabilia, and sat within 15 feet of the emergency exit where the shooter entered. About 15 minutes into the movie, the terrorist came in and “did what he came to do” according to CNN. Katie told me he came in through the emergency exit at the bottom right of the theater, and threw something over their heads. “I thought it was a prank at first, or someone playing along with the movie because it happened during a fight scene.” Katie told me. “Then he opened fire, and Caleb was shot in the right eye as they all tried to duck in cover. “I thought he was dead, because there was so much blood, but he was still moving, and he kept running his fingers through his hair.” Katie and her friend Ashley were staying down right next to Caleb until the shooter left the theater. Within minutes the police was taking people out of the theater, “Caleb was the 4th to be taken out, they did not bother to wait for the ambulance, he was put in the back of a cop car and they drove him straight to University hospital. I did not get to see him again because the police was keeping me, and I did not find out if he was still alive until they released me at about 4 am.

Caleb is now in the ICU, on the ventilator, the surgeon told us he will be in the ICU for one to two weeks if not longer, and is fighting for his life. He has been to surgery twice already, has received over 4 liters of blood, and must go back to get his right eye removed and the pellets from the shot gun removed. Caleb is a friend, a husband, a son, and about to be a father. Caleb and his family have no insurance, and these hospital bills are going to be well into the hundreds of thousands if not millions. Caleb and Katie will be struggling with these hospital bills for the rest of their lives. So I ask anyone who can donate anything, to please do so for these marvelous people that do not deserve any of this that happened to them. If you cannot donate, please spread the word for Caleb, his family, and all the other victims from this horrible tragedy. If you would like to talk to me, and ask any questions, please feel free to do so. My number is 719-369-7208.

I sat down and introduced myself and he looked at me blank. He signed that he was deaf and couldnt read lips.
For the first time the two years I took of ASL back in high school paid off. 
The guy was lost and had no idea how to get back home or communicate with someone in the mall besides writing things down on paper. I asked where he was trying to get to and it was about 15 minutes in the opposite direction. I told the guy I will make sure he got where he needed. Got him there and he burst into tears and ask why a complete stranger whom he didnt know would take time to get him to where he was going and my response was ""If I was in the same circumstance, no way home and no one realizing I was having a problem I would want someone to do the same. All I want is to make someone else who obviously wasn't having the best day to feel better."" 
I don't know the guy and I probably wont see or have a conversation with him ever again but it meant more to me to see him smile than it did to him to get home. 

Made my day.

Glinda met my wife and 3 boys through an equally wonderful lady “mamasboys” who bought pizza for my family.  She asked for a picture of my children, and noticed there were no presents under our tree.  She sent this information to Glinda, who contacted me and asked me to post in Random Acts of Christmas.



I politely declined, and  explained it was going to be a tough Christmas, but we’re a happy family and we’re lucky to have what we have.  We’ll juggle bills and Santa would visit our house, no matter what.  Other families were much more deserving.  Mamasboys insisted, as a thank you for purchasing pizza for us, that I post in RAoC, and Glinda was more than happy to read our post. 



I don’t want to embarrass her, but not only did she purchase 90% of the items on our Amazon wishlist, but insisted that I send more desirables from Kohls.  Of course I declined, and of course, she would hear none of it. 
 


We sent a small Kohl’s list of around 8 or 9 items, all clothes.  Glinda didn’t order even one item off that list...instead after sending all the Amazon items, she went through and created her own Kohl’s list, based on our list, of:  clothes, coats, toys, puzzles, electronics, sweaters, pants, pajamas, games, more clothes, warm (expensive) coats, playdoh and even 2 wrapped presents for me and my wife. She said she “wanted us to have something to open on Christmas as well”



Now, we were of course unaware of any of this.  All of a sudden, 3 giant boxes arrived at our house.  After taking out the contents, my wife and I simply broke down and cried.  Believe me when I say, I don’t cry, unless Mufasa is taking his eternal plunge into the stampede at the hands of Scar.  That’s it. 



But this was above even that…these tears flowed, and truly felt like they were taking the weight of the world, the shame of a thousand failures, and the sadness of a every sad Futurama episode with them.  I felt like a new man…a father worthy of my children’s admiration.  Its been a long time since I felt I deserved that from my children.



Don’t misunderstand, I try to be a good father. I try to make them laugh, and I tell them I love them and kiss them, even though my oldest is in middle school and may get embarrassed.  I try to show them how much they mean to me…but when one considers the simple fact that all a child wants is the innocent ability to play…to have fun, with both friends and family, but with themselves as well..and then, as a father you realize you cannot provide that to them during Christmas, it brings a soul crushing feeling of defeat and shame.  It’s a simple fact, and I have lived with it since the economy crashed in Las Vegas.  I have a good job, but it’s just enough  to pay bills..there is NOTHING extra…ever…NOTHING EXTRA…EVER.  It really beats you down.  Well, it does me, anyway. 
However, after Glinda’s amazing, generous and completely undeserving sharing of Christmas cheer, I felt a little less stress, and a LOT more happiness for my boys.  



As for my wife and my presents, not only did Glinda send 57 items for my boys for Christmas, she included a wonderful Sweater pull over for me, and a simply gorgeous Coach purse for my wife. My wife opened it and said “oh my god…no way..oh my GOD…oh…my…GOD…it’s so beautiful…this is what I would pick 1000 times out of 1000 choices”  and this was before she even pulled it out of the box and I had any idea what it was.  



She explained the sheer beauty that is a Coach purse to me, as well as the sheer beauty that is this purse, regardless of name brand.  She’s not carrying it around like a child who refuses to take off their super hero costume after Halloween.  She even started putting it on the nightstand while we sleep. No joke.  The most expensive purse my wife has EVER owned is a $26 one I bought for her from Target as a birthday present. Other than that, she usually does the 2 for $20 deals so she can have multiple colors.  I swear on my children, that is the complete truth.  We have not had the ability to indulge  in luxuries like purses for a long…LONG time. 



At any rate, her presents to us proved that not only was she trying to provide the best Christmas possible for 3 little boys she had never met, but she was also trying to make a wonderful Christmas for us.  Even though she had already given my wife and I the greatest single Christmas we have ever had, since our marriage 10 years ago (10 years next month :) )but she did it in a way that made us feel special…like we truly mattered to her.



My wife and I both have had issues with our families growing up that most people would consider utterly devastating, disgusting, terrible and downright abusive…so having genuine caring, even, dare I say, genuine LOVE from a total stranger.  It made us feel like we need to be better people on this planet.  We need to share happiness whenever possible.  We are not deserving of what Glinda has given us…but we need to try.
And of course, Glinda’s generosity was only just beginning.  Through my other Reddit posts, she had figured out that my middle son is desperate to play football, but for the past 2 years, since he became eligible, we have not had the money to sign him up.  In Vegas, youth football leagues are not just for the children, they are designed to actually make money off the children and parents,  so the cheapest we’ve found is $160 to sign up, which doesn’t include uniform, or anything other than just “welcome to Nevada Youth Football league. “  Nothing else. 



Glinda, decided on her own, even after protests from me, to send $200 to Xathan to sign him up for football, and the extra to be used towards his uniforms and equipment costs.  The very HOUR it became available to us, we went and signed him up for it.  That morning, he was so nervous about not making the 60 pound cut off for tackle, (he would have to play with 6 year olds if he was less than 60 lbs) that he ate 5 pieces pizza, 2 PB&amp;Js, 2 bowls of pasta and 2 ding dongs, all without us knowing he was doing it.  He weighed in at 61.5 lbs :)  I was so happy for him, I didn’t even drop the hammer on him for burning through all that food…it doesn’t grow on trees you know…but he made it, and we let him slide…:)



But it didn’t stop there. All of a sudden,  we had groupon coupons from Glinda.  Free nights out to funny children shows with our boys, or a free night out with food and drinks to a bar/club for my wife and I. Truly she has decided to completely  adopt our family and refuses to consider us otherwise. She wants to lavish us..not just help…but…love us.  I can’t explain it.  It’s apparent in every PM she sends… and then we had the chance to meet her in person.



She decided to visit Vegas, where we live, and of course, insists we meet for breakfast, of course, at her expense.  I do my best to decline politely, as she’s done wayyyy too much already, but we’re dying to meet her, and Xathan (my middle child, the future football star)  has a special thank you present.  So we’ll meet her and give her hugs and proper face to face thank yous.  Of course, she wont hear any of it.



We meet at the Paris buffet, where she hugs us, spreads instant love, instantly breaks any ice, and makes my wife and I (both of who have trouble socially) feel like we’ve known her forever.  



Reddit, I can only describe Glinda, as a cross between Pheobe from Friends, and Willy Wonka.  She is so fun loving, so open minded, so completely care-free that when you’re In her presence, you feel like family, friend and sincere confidant rolled into one.  She’s made from a different mold…that’s all I can say about her.. My wife and I instantly and completely fell in love with her.  Forgetting all the giving, the caring, the obvious adopting of my family…we would be lucky just to be considered her friend and be able to share family/friend functions with her.  She is truly the life of the party.  Be jealous you were not at that buffet, because it was truly something worthy to be jealous of missing.  We adored her, instantly. 



Of course, in true “Good Witch” form, she pulls out two $20 bills and offers them to my oldest sons, who have taken to her more than they have anyone in our family.   At this point, I don’t even try to interject, as I know it’s futile.  She had hinted that she was going to do this ahead of time, and it was painfully, and clearly obvious that she gets more joy out of helping others, especially children, than one could comprehend. 



But, then she completely goes off the deep end and pulls out $200 and hands them to my wife and I, insisting we take the boys to AdventureDome at the circus circus.  She checked admittance fees and feels that should be enough to get in and leave about $100 left for games, prizes, and who knows what else. Of course she’s crazy, it’s completely too much.  I say “Glinda…are you sure?”  she says “…I think so..my coffee isn’t drugged. I’m of sound mind”  and that was it. There was no arguing..no fighting…nothing other than AdventureDome and a day of fun.  That was simply the end of it, and had I continued to argue the point, she would’ve probably stabbed me in the eye with a  fork.  She takes her new family and their fun very seriously. 



She had given my 2 year old a stuffed bear, who he named after her immediately.  My boys talked about her the entire time we were at AdventureDome. My wife asked what could we have done to deserve meeting such a person.  We certainly don’t deserve this type of love, caring, nor the physical act of handing MONEY to us..it’s just too much to handle.  We cried a few times..we hugged a lot…we feel we gained a family member, and we genuinely hope that she knows all this caring and giving will in no way change the fact that we feel we actually gained a loving and caring family member.  We’d be happy to visit her, to talk to her on the phone, to upvote everything she ever posts, without her ever giving one single additional thing to us.  We’re lucky to have a woman with such an amazing personality in our life, regardless of her desire to help those less fortunate.  
We found a woman…a stranger that is capable of generating love that I’ve never felt for anyone in my family.  My wife, with her own family issues, took to her like one does to an aunt that raised her from infancy.  
It was amazing.  The breakfast was amazing…our Christmas was mind boggling beautiful thanks to Glinda…and my outlook on life moving forward is better all thanks to her.



The pictures that follow do not do Glinda justice.  I just can’t capture the happiness.    There’s tons of other photos of everything Glinda sent, but in the spirit of “WHY” she did it, and not “WHAT”, I left those images out.
Believe me, the true gift this Christmas, is meeting a woman like Glinda…then, a close second, is the Christmas she gave my boys.  The items she sent, and the amount of time, effort and money she spent on my family is not something I’m sure she would be comfortable sharing.  You must understand, Glinda most assuredly did this to make for a wonderful Christmas for my children, and to my wife and myself.



Here’s the pics that show the happiness..the sharing..the smiles… That’s what’s important, and why Glinda did all this for us.



We love you Glinda.  That will NEVER change.

We even started a charity in her name that would not only benefit her, but as well as the other children she grew up with in the system. So far, it's been working.

It hurts me deeply to see my sister live in this state of mind where communication between her and the outside world feels like she's wedged between a wall of solid concrete, and I know I'm not the only person who feels this sentiment.

As of the many people I've talked to, we all share some connection to autism.

All I personally ask of you is to take the time, read our story, and vote in our name.

his time was to soon, and no one deserves to die because of the fact that organs just arent that readily available.

i got the idea to do this after seeing a reddit post about someone whos kidneys had a horrible condition and i asked if i could be of help but he declined.

OKAY on to the catches.. i am broke, you would need to find me a way to get to you, other than that the only other catch is we need compatible blood types (obviously) pm me if you are interested and want to keep this confidential

One of those moments came for me when I was 18, living in the Belleville/Trenton, Ontario area. My father had just picked me up from work and we were heading home. I was talking about what I'd be doing next year and how I was thinking maybe I could just work instead of going to school.

My father, never one for being dramatic, and always quick with a joke, stops talking. No smiles. Not even a glance in my direction. We continue down the road like this for maybe 5km, then he pulls over. When the car stops, he turns to me, eyes moist, and he says, ""Look at me. Look at my life. You don't want this life."" He looked back to the road, put the car in gear, and we remained in silence for the rest of the journey.

I went away to school the following September, I graduated, I work full-time and I do well enough for myself. My father? Well, he's been laid off three times due to companies shutting down, slowing down, or moving to cheaper manufacturing areas. He's working now, but the hours are rough and the money is awful. They can't get by, so I help them when I can, but I can hear it in his voice when he asks for help that it kills him. He's a proud man that wants nothing more than to be able to live his life without asking for help.

He's been a machine operator in a few factories, he has numerous years of lift-truck and warehouse experience, and he's done supervisory work in factories.

I have found out that the most needed quality for success is having the right attitude to your illness- not letting it get the best of you, never give up, do what you can to stay busy and always think positive. Even though I am waiting on a kidney transplant, I try my very best to be a mentor to my fellow dialysis buddies: I volunteer at the hospital, participate in the kidney walks and organized a support group that meets once a week to discuss what each of us is going through in our lives.

After a few social beers and some aimless party hopping I decided to head home around 1:30 because the party I was at was dying down and I have a class in the morning. 

Well, on the walk back to campus you have to walk over a bridge that runs over a four lane highway and is about 40+ feet over the road with nothing but a 5 foot concrete barrier separating the sidewalk from oblivion. Me and my buddy happen to be crossing this bridge and just ahead of us I notice some kid hoisting himself over the edge of the barrier. I sprint up to him, grab him and basically say ""what in the actual fuck are you doing?!"" and he looks at me, says ""no one cares, just let me do it."" I asked him why he was doing it and what the problem was, but he told me not to worry about it and kept saying ""it'll be funny.""
at this point I just stare at the kid in disbelief, and just then he breaks away from me and tries to jump again. I grab the guy and basically lock him in a bear hug and start to talk him down. He kept saying how it wasn't a big deal and that I should just let him jump, but I said ""no way in hell am I letting you jump. Someone out there cares about you, and you are gonna march your ass up the damn street till you get where you need to be."" He calmed down after that and kind of came to his senses. I started to walk him (forcibly) off of the overpass and up the street. Me and my buddy walked with him for about half a mile until we hailed a cab and sent him to where he needed to be (a friends house at an off campus apartment). 

I pretty much did all I could for the kid, I was pretty shook up about it. If I hadn't left the party when I did or took the way home that I took, this kid would have plummeted to his death without anyone even noticing. I don't know, maybe I should have stayed with the kid all the way home. All I know is, when i went out tonight I didn't expect to be a fucking street therapist. Maybe this will get downvoted to hell. I don't care. The moral of my story is this: If you see someone royally fucking up this weekend, or any day of the week for that matter, make a point to help them out. It just might save a life.

Update: 11/10/11 8:44 am

The person who posted this ad replied to me and said ""You can visit the shelter between 12-4you today. These pups are in the intake building "" which most likely means that someone has to go there and physically pull the dog out.
If you can help, I think the best course of action would be to call the shelter Pasco County Animal Services Animal Services Center 19640 Dogpatch Lane (Formerly Lake Patience Rd.) Land O' Lakes, FL 34638 Phone: (813) 929-1212 and tell them that you are trying to work out the logistics to get the dog out, especially if you are out of state.
There are rescues in the area called http://guardianangeldogrescue.org and another one RUFF.PETFINDER.COM which might help to pull, but they most likely will need 100% commitment that you'll take a dog.
Regardless, the first step is to call the shelter ASAP. Please help if you can!

**Update 1: 11/10/2011 1:20 pm**

I just got off the phone with shelter. She is still alive, but the pitbull that is on that picture was euthanized :( I cannot take a dog myself because I already have one and a cat, but I can pay for her adoption, spay, vaccines etc. It will buy time to find someone who can take her. Please if you can, please give her a chance! 

The shelter done with euthanizing today, tomorrow they are closed and I will be there first thing in the morning on Saturday to pay for adoption. This will get the ball rolling, as it will take a week or more to do the spay thing, exams, etc. Even if you are out of state we can work out the transport, I might be able to chip in, maybe some other kind redditors do the same. 

I know that it is a drop in a sea of misery, but we all here have a chance to do something for her, some real chance to help, not an abstract thing. Please, if you can help. Thank you. 

**Update 11/11/11**

Good news! Somebody adopted that pup last night and not only that! That person also adopted her mom (it turned out her mom was at the shelter too)

The papers were signed and this sweet pup is now out of the woods. She is still at the shelter and sometimes the adoptions get cancelled, but lets hope it will not happen here. I cannot be 100% certain that it was a redditor who adopted her, but I'd like to think so, because both dogs were at the shelter since Nov. 4 or 5 and nobody was interested. And then both got adopted yesterday! :)

Another sad fact I've learned during this ordeal is that the dog the owner surrenders gets euthanized much faster compared to a stray. Please think twice before you surrender, if you can! 

Thank you all, reddit was awesome about this pup and so many people stepped up and offered to adopt. There are many dogs like her, scared out their mind sitting right now at the kill-shelter somewhere. If you'd like a dog, please consider an adoption first if you can.

As I said in the title, I have a special needs child, a newborn baby, and an unemployed wife. I am employed and I make enough money to keep us above water. However, we are living in a bug infested apartment. The reason being is that we pay over $1000 a month for health insurance. My wife cannot get a job as she has to stay at home and tend to our children. 

I was involuntarily separated from the US Air Force after 9 years. They separated me one month after my daughter was born. I was lucky as I was able to find a decent job a month after I was out, but the transition and move drained our savings.

A little background on my son:
My son was born at 26 weeks and spent the first 109 days of his life in the NICU. He is 2 and a half years old now but struggles with cerebral palsy, autism, and a feeding tube. No daycare in the area will accept him due to his conditions. We work as hard as we can to make his life happy, but we are struggling right now to even make ends meet.

I'm not asking for much, and I know there are people that have it much worse than us. I just want to see if anyone out there would like to give us some assistance. We are trying to pay off some debt and perhaps move into a better place that will be better for our children. I have been a redditor for a while and I have seen what you guys and gals are capable of. If you feel like this is unwarranted and want to downvote me into oblivion because I am asking for help, that's fine, it's your choice. I'm just hoping some kind soul will see this and reach out a helping hand. If you feel like you want to help, please message me.

I'll post some pics of my children in the comments.

Edit: Thank you to a Reddit friend for pointing out things I should add to my post. We live in Hattiesburg, MS and we are looking for any type of monetary assistance to help get into a residence that would be more conducive to raising our family. We have a paypal, so I guess that is an option.

Edit 2: Created a chipin event. [Feel free to donate there if you are so inclined](http://mcphailfamily.chipin.com/my-family-needs-better-living-conditions)

Edit 3: [People requested pics of me in uniform](http://imgur.com/a/yNYy4)

Edit 4: I have received a good many questions about this so I'll address it. My son's Cerebral Palsy is mild. He doesn't walk, but he crawls around great and can pull up on things to standing. His autism is also pretty mild as well. This all stems from a bleed in is brain shortly after birth (intraventricular hemorrhage). This caused him to have a buildup of fluid around his brain (hydrocephalus). He needed a surgery to install a VP shunt at about 3 and a half months old. He will have the shunt for the rest of his life and it will need to be dealt with as he grows. [A pic of his surgery incision for reference. Not graphic.](http://imgur.com/XGRIc) The feeding tube (g-tube) comes from him having an extreme oral aversion. This stems from having a ventalator tube down his throat for six weeks. He wouldn't eat anything by mouth until he was about a year and 9 months. All he eats now is crackers, yogurt, and he will drink pediasure. We also push vitamins and fatty foods (Oils, milk, etc...) through the tube in his stomach. We have been working like crazy trying to get him to eat. We pay for all of the pediasure out of pocket (and it's not cheap). He has been in PT, OT, and speech since he was a year and a half old. Hope that answers any questions on him. If you have any more feel free to ask.

Edit 5: People have asked for more proof that I am who I say I am. [Hopefully this will suffice](http://imgur.com/BEmDJ)


UPDATE: Wow! You guys are awesome! So far we have received close to $700 and a bunch of very helpful items are being sent to us. We also are very thankful for all of the advice and thoughts you guys and gals have sent our way. I will post some pics of the kids with the stuff we receive as it comes in. Reddit, you never cease to amaze me. Thank you so much.

He was dressed in about 20 layers of clothing, and had his possessions in plastic bags. He was confused about airport security. I was behind him, and restless. i told him what to do, to remove his coat, belt and shoes, and to put his stuff in the bins. He was very grateful. So grateful, in fact, he bought me lunch. We were both flying alone and had about 4 hours before our planes left for different locations. He had never flown before, but I didn't know that when I helped him. Come to find out, he had too much stuff for carry-on, so he put on as many of his clothes as he could, and threw away the rest. He was going to be with his mother, who had a stroke.

He was the only person I let read my book in progress. He loved it, and left me a business card of a friend of his who was a publisher. I submitted my book to the publisher just last week, and didn't tell anyone. As a special favor to his friend, the publisher said he would take my current chapters and read them over. He was told the plot by the man whom I helped, and enjoyed it very much. I never even knew this man's name, but this post is to tell Mr. Black Gentleman [which is what he asked me to call him after I tried to thank him for buying my BK in the airport] that he has changed my life in a very significant way. Thank you, stranger....you gave me hope for the human race.

I just found out that my good friend Wayne is having a really rough Father's Day (his first).

  [He and his wife](http://i.imgur.com/bXkw0.jpg), Michelle were ecstatic a year ago when they first found out they were pregnant, and even more so when they learned they would be having twins. Babies [Jackson and Lucie](http://i.imgur.com/EeSr3.jpg) were born about 9 weeks ago, but that's when the joy ended.

  While [Lucie](http://i.imgur.com/lKRyg.jpg) entered the world a perfectly healthy baby girl, her twin brother [Jackson](http://i.imgur.com/j3cCc.jpg) was born with a congenital heart defect called Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS). The left side of his heart was severely underdeveloped at birth and his need for constant care has ripped this new family apart.

  They live in Idaho, but mother Michelle and babies are receiving care in San Francisco while papa Wayne is hard at work back home. He has run out of time off, and his employer doesn't pay for medical leave.

  I just learned today that Wayne's Sister-in-Law Christine has set up a [Youcaring.com donation site](http://www.youcaring.com/fundraiser_details?fundraiser_id=4058&amp;url=twinboyjacksons9weeksoldheartconditionkeepsfamilyindifferentstateshelpraisemoneytobringthemtogether) for them to help cover medical costs and to enable Wayne to take some time off of work to be with his family.

  I wanted to open this story up to all the caring hearts on Reddit. I've been on here for almost two years and it's no secret that you are all a magnificent group of human beings when it comes to helping those who cannot help themselves. It's been a pretty punishing Father's Day for Wayne and his family, but I hope this humble post can turn things around for them.

  Thank you in advance for anything you can do for them, whether it be through positive vibes, prayers, [donations](http://www.youcaring.com/fundraiser_details?fundraiser_id=4058&amp;url=twinboyjacksons9weeksoldheartconditionkeepsfamilyindifferentstateshelpraisemoneytobringthemtogether) or just spreading the word.

My flight left at 8:00am and I was through security and at the gate easily an hour early, so I went to get some coffee..

I got in line at DD behind a girl holding some coupons. It was clear that she was mentally challenged. After a minute or so, the typical NYC asshole got in line behind me. His wife, covered in diamond, tennis skirt on, and racquet bag hanging from her back, was frantically running to the gate while simultaneously shouting her coffee order to her husband. She returned a minute later yelling at him to hurry... they argued back and forth about whether or not to get coffee and then she ran back to the gate. 

Meanwhile, the girl in front of me got to the register and simply handed the coupons to the cashier. She offered no explanation, just handed the coupons back to the girl and said, ""nope."" The girl, very obviously confused, handed the coupons back. At this point, the cashier got frustrated and said, ""WE DO NOT TAKE THIS. You will have to pay full price."" The girl took the coupons back and held them closely to her face trying to read and understand.

Then, the assholes wife returned and said they were calling final boarding. The man turned to the clerk and like the self-centered asshole he obviously was yelled, ""can you take the order of someone who knows what they want?"" The cashier turned to me and asked if she could help me... I said, ""yes. I'll take a large iced-coffee and I'm going to help this girl get what she wants."" I asked her which sandwich she wanted and she pointed at both coupons, so I ordered both for her. I made sure to take my time getting out my wallet to pay for the sandwiches and coffee. The guy behind me yelled ""fuck it"" and ran to the gate.

I handed the receipt to the girl and told her to wait at the counter. She looked at me, smiled, and gave me a huge hug. Have some compassion people. If you are that set on getting coffee before boarding the plane (the plane that will inevitably have free coffee), then get to the airport early.

Wait for my announcement tonight. This is to prevent people from receiving multiple gifts.

---

**Reminder:** Please **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SirLlama)** me when your offer has been accepted. Provide the item that is claimed and who it is claimed by.

---

**To be clear:** You don't have to be a giver in order to receive a gift. This is open to anyone.

---

**For full details and what's required of both giver and recipient [CLICK HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/14cxke/)**

**How to claim a gift:**

* The giver's name is hyper-linked. Upon clicking said name, you will go straight to Private Message and can then request the item from that giver. 

* **If the giver does not respond:** **a)** The giver is away from his/her computer and hasn't checked their mail or **b)** the offer was already taken. **Advice:** Check the thread and see if the gift is ~~crossed out~~. Feel free to make another request, but **do not** take two gifts.

* **If the giver has responded but the offer is still not crossed out:** It's most likely because I was away from the computer.

* **Only one gift per person:** This give away will function on the honor system. However, every giver will report to me the names of those who they gave their gift to. If I find out that a member has been given more than one gift, it is grounds for a ban and I will instruct the giver to offer that gift up to someone else.

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts, immediately PM the giver and ask that they choose someone else. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE REPORTED FOR SCAMMING**

* **Scamming:** Seriously, don't do it. Many of our sister subreddits share a ban list together. In addition to a RandomKindness ban you can bet that most popular 'helping subreddits' will refuse to help you.

**Update: I spoke with the family about the concerns that people have expressed here. They provided this statement explaining their situation.**

""We got Bellabee around her 2nd birthday, with the understanding that it would be a simple process finished in a few months at the cost of about $6,000.  We were approached by the birth family, and would not have pursued the situation had we not felt it in the best interest of Bellabee.  The situation changes constantly, and has been an emotional roller coaster mostly at the expense of Bellabee.  While the details are private for us and for the birth family, please know that we would not ask if the need were not great. We are able to take care of her, but are overwhelmed with the trial costs.  This little girl had already had more than 4 ""mothers"" and 3 ""fathers"" before the age of two all of which moved on when she was no longer the easy choice.  She is by no means the saddest story you will hear about a child being adopted, but she is our child and we are not taking the easy road and need some help with the final stretch.  If you do not feel like donating then please don't.  We have chosen to fight for what is best for Bellabee and are only asking for help from others so it doesn't bankrupt us in the process.""",,False,self,t5_2szh3,True,,,True,t3_pes3r,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/pes3r/a_friend_and_his_wife_are_finalizing_the_adoption/,

I walked by and said ' Oooh Tall Girl' and then walked away ... she had beautiful black hair and green eyes, I was a few years older but something about her was ... well hard to explain.

A few months went by without me seeing her, I was thinking about her but couldn't muster up the courage to call, she was devastatingly beautiful and I was in a bit of an awkward place mentally
Was working at a local library while in school and one day coming out of work, I decide out of the blue to walk through the mall to my house, someone calls out my name and here she is, sitting at the food court, I walk up and ask her out, she accepts.

First date goes well, she leans in for a kiss, it's a small kiss and 10 years later we still laugh about it but it was the start of a great adventure.
I took a good entry level job within a technology firm in Montreal, was doing well for myself, she went into university to study Psychology and I was putting money aside to maybe look towards the future with a bit more optimism but lost my job when the company closed in 2008 due to the shitty economy, struggled to find work for a few years, lost everything and only got back on my feet recently in a 'take any job I can find and go back to school situation'

She finished psychology and went into medecine, always encouraging me and loving me to no end.

It'll be 10 years on the 2nd of March but her birthday is February 14th, on Valentines day of all days !!! I got her a beautiful ring selling some of my stuff, she is not expecting it and actually has an exam in the morning, but I know she's been wanting me to propose for a while.

I hope Reddit can give me a hand if any redditors in Montreal can help me find a nice restaurant reservation or any of you have a discount coupon to somewhere nice I could use the help. I'm currently studying to teach history at the high school level and working at the same time, any help would be much appreciated !

.........

Update 1 - thank you all for the good vibes, unfortunately living in Montreal makes it a bit hard for me to go anywhere like New York or Miami to take her for a bite, but thank you for the people offering, I wish you all Karma and goodness galore, I will post all the craziness tomorrow. I might end up proposing at her mom's house in the evening, she has a hardcore studying schedule which makes it hard to get her out for even a few minutes but I will try hard ... 

Update 2 - turn up at the jeweler this morning with mom in tow, the ring is getting its final polishing up, stressed as ever, I babble  the entire way, i'm presently at work and waiting for him to call me with everything donezo

Update 3 - proposed, it's mayhem here

I'm going to make an update post shortly after his birthday, likely on July 10th to coincide with my cake day (I'm gonna karma whore for more visibility and cause I can)

I need some help. I'm 28 years old. I have a three year old daughter, almost no social life, the worst credit anyone could ever have and I'm currently contracting for a 9/hr position part time just to have a little something. I've decided to go back to school and major in Electrical and Computer Engineering so that I won't have as many problems finding a job and so I can be seen as a role model for my daughter. Unfortunately, I don't qualify for loans so I've been filling out scholarship forms and essays like crazy. This particular scholarship is based on popular vote. I'm starting a little late so I'm up against high school aged kids who don't have the same kind of obligations on their time as I do limiting their social interactions. If you could simply click on the link and vote for the essay I would greatly appreciate it. If you could share the link and help me get more votes I would appreciate that as well. It's a $5,000 scholarship which will cover my entire first semester (starting this fall) books, labs, and tuition. I don't need your money or random things sent to my house. I just need people to click twice. I really do need this scholarship if I'm ever going to get out of this basement apartment and into a meaningful life.

This little girl's name is McKenna May and she is four years old.  She was diagnosed with leukemia in 2010 and actually just had her last treatment last month.  Her Mother and Grandmother are her caretakers. Her Dad was not there very much during her treatment and is now saying that since she is technically no longer ill, other kids deserve the trip more than she does.  This means he refuses to sign the necessary paperwork for her to go, and according to Make-A-Wish, BOTH parents have to voluntarily sign the papers regardless of custody....Here's a little excerpt of what she has gone through in the last two years (directly quoted from the article):
""She was diagnosed with leukemia in April 2010 and had her last treatment last month. During that time, she had 15 spinal taps to make sure the cancer hadn't spread, multiple chemotherapy treatments, skin burns and vomiting from the chemo, and steroid injections that compromised her immune system. She was hospitalized four times due to high fevers. She won't be ruled ""cancer free"" until five years after her last treatment.""
I understand that there are terminally ill children in the world who deserve to get their wishes granted and Make-A-Wish seems to think she deserves is just as much as they do.

Welcome back to the giveaway everyone! I hope you are ready for some fun every weekend! That's right, I'm aiming to do this EVERY WEEKEND until the end of 2012 or the end of the world, whatever comes first.

Games | Rating| Copies | Description | Store Page

(Note: Want to make this list even more awesome? Donate games! PM me if you're willing!)

**Entry Rules:**

1. Make sure you have a working Steam account that that your computer meets minimum requirements to run the game. System requirements can almost always be found on the game's store page.

2. Simply post below what game you are interested in! (Since there's only one game this time, that's pretty straight forward) **Do not post any other information, just state that you want a game.**

3. Sometime this Sunday, I'll use Random.org to pick a winner and then I'll send you a PM asking for **the e-mail that is registered to your Steam account.** This way I can send you the game without having to add you to my Steam list and we don't clutter each other's friends list. (Note: Once the gift is sent, sometime Steam will add us anyways.)

4. Come back next week for more chances to win, or better yet, if you win be sure to pay it forward and donate games for the giveaway!

I restarted this at #1, but it's worth noting that there was seven (!) weekend giveaways last year. [Here's a list.](http://briguy.us/SGGW)

Edit: **For the love of god people, upvote it too if you're going to enter. This is a self post - my karma doesn't go up if you vote on it.**

Edit2: Sorry I didn't close this on Sunday when I should have, but because it's a long weekend I figure it's okay. Anyways, the winners of the games are:

She has been wanting an Ipad for quite some time and is unable to afford one. This would mean so much to her. Just vote for **Krista M** on the link above. You are able to vote once per hour, per IP address until noon April 27th. Please! Just one quick vote, again this would mean so much to her. (She doesn't know I'm doing this) I want to see the look on her face when her vote count just skyrockets as she is constantly checking her votes. Will return with picture of dog with Ipad if she wins!!!

EDIT: 9% away from 1st, if you could all vote again within the next hour that would be perfect. I actually just went into a starbucks and told a few people to vote when they got home ;) Awkward...but oh well lmao!

Recipients, please make sure to contact your Giver when you receive your gift and don't forget to say thanks!

**Reminder:** Please **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Avien)** me when your offer has been accepted. Provide the item that is claimed and who it is claimed by.

**To be clear:** You don't have to be a giver in order to receive a gift. This is open to anyone.

**For full details and what's required of both giver and recipient [CLICK HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/v0m4h/rk_announcing_the_rk_10000_subscriber_giftaway/)**

**How to claim a gift:**

* The giver's name is hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name, you will go straight to Private Message and can then request the item from that giver.

* **If the giver does not respond:** **a)** The giver is away from his/her computer and hasn't checked their mail or **b)** the offer was already taken. **Advice:** Check the thread and see if the gift is ~~crossed out~~. Feel free to make another request, but **do not** take two gifts.

* **Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However, every giver will report to me the names of those who they gave their gift to. If I find out that a member has been given more than one gift, it is grounds for a ban and I will instruct the giver to offer that gift up to someone else.

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts, immediately PM the giver and ask that they choose someone else. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE REPORTED FOR SCAMMING**

* **Scamming:** Seriously, don't do it. Many of our sister subreddits share a ban list together. In addition to a RandomKindness ban you can bet that most popular 'helping subreddits' will refuse to help you.

Having a little brother, I know beyond a doubt that the happiness of a child will ALWAYS beat the happiness of me getting something that I can afford with a little saving.

Post in the comments what you would like and I will agree to the top voted comment after 4 days. Fear not ye of lower upvotes, for I have a consolation prize fund set aside as well. 

I would much rather prefer to get a BUNCH of lesser $ things this time, (I know those of you that have looked at my history have said, ""DDDAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMNNNNN!!!!!!"" but, that's not the direction I am going for this time around.

I want for a young child to walk out in to his living room (or wake up in it, I know exactly what that's like growing up in a 1 bedroom apartment with my parents) and just being absolutely ECSTATIC with the sheer volume of presents.

Be prepared to have a list of toys that I can purchase and a place to buy them from (hopefully amazon.com as I have Prime and that shit ROCKS!) so that I can make a few people's Christmas that much brighter for them.

EDIT 1: Please don't send me PMs of what you would like and post it in the comments. I may not be able to get everyone what they want but, I will do what I can. Also, if you know someone who can use some help, before just stating that, find out what they would like and either post that for them or have them post it.

EDIT 2: One thing that might help others (and hopefully inspire others to provide what I am unable to) is if you provided proof of your struggling in your original post. I know it may seem like a hard thing to ask but, I am also trying to involve other people that are living a little above their comfort zone to help out and I know nothing moves me quite like a sob story. 

And PLEASE do not just automatically upvote the top voted comment and take the time to read everyone's story!!!

Edit 3: The one thing that I DEMAND is NO requests for Gift Cards at shops. Who knows what those will be used for? I would much rather prefer a list of ACTUAL things to purchase. Sorry if I'm coming off as an ass (only a douchebag would think that after reading everything) but I don't want my hard earned dollars going to someone that is lying.

EDIT 4: Remember, DO NOT SHARE ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION IN THE THREAD!!!! If you ask someone for their personal information, remember to do it in PM!!! What may show up as a PM in your Inbox could also just be a reply to your post in a Thread and anything you say in the Reply will show up there as well. If you are going to give out personal information, remember to ENSURE that it is ONLY in PM.

EDIT 5: There is someone that is willing to match my offer but did not want to make her own post. Please DO NOT feel like you shouldn't post due to other peoples posts.

Starting this weekend and going every weekend until the end of this year (or even longer!) I'm going to give away one game on Steam (or Desura, but I've never used it) for ONE lucky Redditor!

How does it work? What do I do?

* **Setup your Steam Wishlist with games you want.** This is the most important.
* Post your Steam community ID URL in the comment. I would VERY MUCH appreciate you posting a SteamID64 link so that just in case you change it, I won't get a dead link. You can use **[SteamRep](http://steamrep.com/)** to get the proper link.
* Wait until Sunday night where I pick one person and they get a random game from their wishlist!

Notes:

* I'm keeping a personal limit of $50 per person. Please don't abuse the system by putting only one $49.99 game in your wishlist. I will skip you.
* If your Reddit OR Steam account looks like an alternate account, I will skip you. I don't want multiple entries.
* I will be GIFTING you the game, not TRADING it. If I trade it to you, then you can possibly turn around and trade it away for something else. That's not the point here. You get the game.

I will NOT be crossposting this to /r/gaming or any other subreddit because if I do, I'll get flooded with more entries than I can handle. Please don't go and x-post it yourself. I don't want that.

**Any comment with a Steam Profile URL will be considered an entry!** Questions, comments, concerns, or praise, just comment away!

Good luck!

Edit: Some more info

* The winner will be chosen on Sunday. Sorry if that is a long time to wait!
* When next weekend comes around, a new post will be made. Be sure you're subscribed/front page'd /r/randomkindness
* If you want to join up with me and make it two games next weekend, PM me.

**Edit2: At the rate this is going I'm going to call the ""contest"" over on Saturday instead. Next time I will post on Friday instead of Thursday.**

1328395409.0,77,self.RandomKindness,pb4ra,[REQUEST] I ask a humble favor for my sister.,nugznhugz,88,11,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/pb4ra/request_i_ask_a_humble_favor_for_my_sister/,"Hey there Reddit! I was wondering if you guys would want to put your best foot forward and donate to help keep Brianna at home and help with Brianna’s Home Makeover? This is going to be a long post I know, but it’s an amazing story. Yes I said STORY. So sit back, grab something to eat, and read on! If you’re more of a TL;DR person skip down the 4th paragraph. (Check out the photo album and links too!)



So my sister is the most amazing person I met. She is the very definition of a warrior. When she was 10 she was diagnosed with a rare vanishing bone disease. How rare do you say? Well so far only 200 cases are known to man, 27 cases ever known in the US, and only one other person besides my sister is living with it today. When we little girls, she always complained of a neck/collar bone pain. One night after her basketball game the pain was unbearable so my father massaged her shoulders. Upon doing so he found that she was missing a collar bone. They raced my sister to the ER and stayed there until early morning with no information as to what was going on inside my sisters body. Doctors were at a loss for words. The only thing they could do was to send Brianna to a specialist in Dallas. (6 hours from our hometown) So we hoped in the car and proceeded to have a “quick vacation’ as my parents called it. (Mind you I was 6 and my sister was 10 so I was very oblivious as to what was going on) The doctors in Dallas diagnosed Brianna with Gorhams Disease, gave her 2 years to live, and sent her to another specialist in Chicago.



Let’s fast forward 14 YEARS. My sister is now quadriplegic , has undergone over 50 surgeries, lost a lung, and her body is full of steel rods. That’s the jiff of it. My sister began being “home-schooled” by the time HS came around. At the end of her Senior year she graduated with HONORS, and a special ceremony was held for her at the nursing home she was staying at. The whole school/community was in attendance for the event. Fast forward a few more years to Briannas 21st birthday. This is an awesome milestone right? Wrong. In the state of Texas Brianna is no longer considered a child, and her insurance money that keeps her at home would run out. Our Aunt “Pattie” threw out the idea that we have a fundraiser and set Brianna up a trust fund. In October of 2009 we launched “Bri’s Buddies” and held our first fundraiser “Bri’s Walk”. Since then we have had many more fundraisers to keep Bri’s’ trust filled. Hoorayy!!



Fast forward to the present day. My sister was always told she could do anything but with her sickness one thing that wasn’t on that list was living alone/having her own place. The same thing every young adult dreams about. Right now we’re in our 10th day of construction . Plumbing has been laid, and the foundation has been poured. Our local news station has already done a segment on the event, trying to get more donations rolling in. That’s where you come in Reddit, I see ya’ll helping out people in need all the time. Donate money for a direct cause; keeping Brianna at home. HER HOME. My family doesn’t come from money at all. We do what we can to survive. If there ever comes a time where my family cannot pay to keep my sister at home the only option is to send her to live in a nursing home. How would you like to be 23, quadriplegic, and living with your friends’ grandparents? I know I wouldn’t.



My sister has never once complained about her life, or been bitter. She loves life and lives it to the fullest with a smile on her face. A newspaper journalist once asked how she felt about dying and she said “…I don’t think about dying, I only think about living...” So if that gives you any idea of what kind of mentality she has. So please Reddit, I ask a humble favor. Spare a dollar or two and make my sister the happiest girl in the world.

She deserves it!


TL;DR My sister is terminally ill, local community is building her a house, would love it if you could donate.

Today Geoff and I met real angels on earth. Here is the story:


I am working with a family which needed 2 twin beds for their children. The children had no beds and were sleeping with their mom. When first I met with her all she wanted was for the kids to have their own beds, nothing else. She had been laid off and had held down 5 temp jobs while trying to obtain permanent employment again. The family budget is so tight that beds were a luxury that mom could just not afford. 

I worked to get the beds donated and got funds to pay for new mattresses and box springs. I discovered that I could get brand new beds, mattresses and mattress pads through IKEA cheaper. 
I contacted their customer service personnel for the South Philly store and secured directions on how to use an organization check and get the tax removed. 

Armed with all my documents and specific instructions on where to go to make the transaction, Geoff and I took the truck to Philly today to pick up the beds. 
The two little ones 6 and 9 were waiting for us to bring their first beds ever at 3:30pm after school.


When we arrived, IKEA informed us that they never take checks and we would need a PA tax exempt document. We requested to speak to the manager. The employee we were speaking with said ""I am the manager"". We said, you must have a boss. He said yes the store manager. We said we wanted to speak to him. James the store manager worked very hard to fix the problem but it could not be solved because it was company wide policy.

 He was talking to someone on his phone as I discussed the family situation with Geoff, expressing how disappointed these kids would be, how I was afraid child protection may get involved if I didn't get these beds to the kids and how I couldn't get the money for the beds for at least another week. 


What we didn't realize was a customer was listening carefully to the story and stood up, offering to pay the bill. I expressed my appreciation but couldn't possibly accept her offer as it was a $399.99 bill. She again expressed that she wanted to do this. The store manager felt terrible about the situation and offered his own personal $30 IKEA gift card. 

I composed myself as did Geoff and said that I would accept their kindness if the woman would give me her contact information so I could return the money via an agency check next week. She was hesitant but agreed to the arrangement. The manager also arranged a coupon that would cover the tax so the final charge would not include the tax.

[REQUEST]",nillajenn,95,19,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/1dnplg/pregnant_lonely_depressed_lost_no_one_to_talk_to/,"I want another human in my life, I am requesting that someone help me with emotional/personal support and ideas.  I am at a complete loss.  I feel so useless and horrible about myself all the time.  I am  just 9 weeks away from having a baby and my whole existence hasn't been worse. I have no desire to hurt myself or the baby but I have not been more depressed and out of hope in my life.  I don't like who I am, what I look like, where I am, how I got here, etc...  I don't have a lot of choices that aren't going to cause me more pain int he future.  I just want a human to help me feel better, I know I have the ability but not the motivation.  I have a list of things that bring me to this state of misery.   

1.  I am lonely.  My two friends moved out of state this year and my baby's father (casual boyfriend) travels for work and I only get to see him about 7 days out of the month.  when he is in town he is very busy taking care of things that need his attention because he is never in town (DMV, Taxes, House Matters, etc..)

2.  I cannot return to work until I can travel out of town by myself which will likely be in a decade.  My career is too travel and time astringent to be a mother.  My job requires travel for 3-7 weeks at a time and international travel.  Lack of income also plays a part here too...  This career is not at all conducive to having a child, pet or even a plant.

3.  My ex divorced me because he was unhappy with our sex life and sought other partners, one of which he is marrying soon.  He has custody of our 5 year old son and will not facilitate a relationship between my son and I.  He lives 2,000 miles away and his lawyer mother managed to pull all the bells and whistles to back me into a legal corner so that I cannot get custody.  I have to resign to the idea that my son may not know me until he is ready to come to me when he is older.  I let my ex have custody due to my financial hardship after being dependent for 4 years (same career before - cannot work with a child.)  I thought I was doing the right thing for my son - not signing him off.


4.  I live in Las Vegas and do not enjoy it at all.  I am not a drinker or partier and it is hard to meet people who aren't completely flaky or transient.  I have made such an effort to make friends and over the years managed to make a few but as I mentioned before (I think) they moved away this year.

5.  My boyfriend is a photographer that has quit taking pictures because he thinks I am too miserable to have my pictures taken.  I don't reject taking pictures but I am honest when I don't like the result and I never do.  My hair is disgusting looking (I quit bleaching it blonde, dyed it darker and I am growing it out because I don't know what to do with it.) My doctor said I can dye it but I am afraid of screwing it all up - and I cannot afford my hair girl right now because as I mentioned I am jobless.  My skin is awful with hormonal acne (which was there before my pregnancy) 

AND I HAVE AN AWFUL AWFUL STAINED FRONT TOOTH.  It is a porcelain that was supposed to be temporary.  I got it on discount while in college because m tooth broke and the dentist got the color completely wrong.  I don't ever smile because of it and I just realized that I haven't smiled properly for almost 10 years.  This is also why I don't like my pictures.  All I see is a brown fake tooth in the front of my mouth.  I wonder if I will ever have pictures with people I love while smiling genuinely instead of always being so self conscious and afraid of the outcome of the picture.  I avoid being happy because of it.   

Not only does the tooth prevent me from taking pictures but it also makes me afraid to be happy.  

I LITERALLY FEEL EMBARRASSED TO BE HAPPY.  I have an overwhelming shame and guilt when I get tinges of excitement in my life.  For some reason I always feel like being surprised or excited is showing weakness or stupidity.  I don't THINK this, logically - I FEEL it.  It is awful and I want to share myself being happy with people I care about.


6.  I am/was an avid hobbyist and I have no space to work on anything.  My ex sold our home out from under me after he moved out and I was pressured to vacate with very little notice.  I had to throw away more than three quarters of everything I had ever owned and move into a storage unit.  Now I am in my boyfriends house by myself all the time with no place to unpack anything and no resources to get some sort of space for myself.

7.  I am also suffering from general discontent over my pregnant body, but this is something that I know will pass - even if it does take a few years.  It still gets to me on a daily basis.

8.  My boyfriend and I have a less than ideal relationship - one obvious component being his excessive absence.  Him and I are just really different and are not often ""on the same page"".  We both like to be romanced with our confirmation of being cared for being derived from the other person doing the ""romancing""  we are usually dead in the water when spending time together - both of us sitting in silence waiting for the other one to be affectionate.  We love each other but find it very difficult to be ""in love"".

9.  I used to be so confident and happy with myself.  When I was a stay at home mom with my son I made various things and took a lot of pride in it. I remember being happy and confident - and (bear with me) I am ashamed to be ashamed to be happy.  Knowing how I used to be confident and how much everyone around me enjoyed makes feeling like I do even worse.  There are a lot of irreversible factors involved now so I don't have a clear cut plan of how to be happy again.

10.  I am so afraid this will affect my soon to be born.  I am afraid of the depression getting unreasonable and out of control once she arrives.  I'm afraid of losing her and everything else because I cannot be happy.  

I feel like I am on the path of the dead.  I am just stumbling down the line between cradle and coffin with nothing but a heavy distorted silence consuming me.  I have mentioned these problems to my doctor and she doesn't want to refer me to a psychiatrist/psychologist right now (unless I were a danger to myself or the baby) as it would be part of my medical record and I may be treated differently/poorly if we jump the gun and put it in writing.  She has given me the option but together we decided to wait until there were more warning flags.

I cannot get out of bed (I do - there are some things that do not wait, like a dog's need to go outside) but all I want is sleep and isolation.  Well - its not all I want, obviously.  I want a person in my life I can rely on for advice, support, laughter, etc...  

I want to feel better about myself.  Physically and emotionally.

I know the people who are still ""in my life"" (my boyfriend and unborn) are relying on me to be happier and to come out of this but I am even more frightened and depressed by this prospect.

I have no contact with my family, we have along dark past that I cannot associate myself with anymore.  My biological family is not an option.  

tl;dr  I have no emotioanl support, I am pregnant and due very soon, I am by myself 90% of the time, my friends moved out of state, my ex divorced me and took custody of my 5 year old son via legal trickery, my ex sold my home from underneath me, I had to leave behind/dispose of almost everything I owned, I cannot continue my career because of the baby, I have a disgusting tooth that has prevented me from smiling for over 10 years, I don't like my pictures because of my tooth and my photogrpaher boyfriend stopped taking pictures all together because I am always so miserable.

Spoke with doctor and my situation isn't a threat to me or the baby physically but she is aware of how I feel.  She doesn't want to jump the gun by ""labeling me"" as unstable on my medical record as I am aware of myself and my actions.

The giver's name is hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name, you will go straight to Private Message and can then request the item from that giver.


**If the giver does not respond: a)** The giver is away from his/her computer and hasn't checked their mail or **b)** the offer was already taken.**Advice:** Check the thread and see if the gift is ~~crossed~~ out. Feel free to make another request, but do not take two gifts.


**Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However, every giver will report to me the names of those who they gave their gift to. If I find out that a member has been given more than one gift, it is grounds for a ban and I will instruct the giver to offer that gift up to someone else.


**If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts, immediately PM the giver and ask that they choose someone else. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE REPORTED FOR SCAMMING**

I teach underserved students in New Orleans. Many of them are very far below grade level, and I've begun using a strategy to help them analyze literature and write about it, but it's challenging. I'm helping them color-code their writing so they can make sure to write really effectively.

As of right now, I bought a class set of the highlighters I need (Blue, Yellow, and Green, specifically), but kids don't get to own them or use them outside of my classroom. I really wish I could get all of them what they need, but I spent almost $60 on just the one class set. 

Each box is $5 and can be found on Amazon. Anyone with Amazon Prime gets free shipping. Not sayin' but I'm sayin'.

Thanks for those who spent the time reading this. I know money's tight for everyone, but every little bit would help.

**Edit #2** A HUGE thank you to everyone who helped out! I'm currently sitting on about 300 highlighters from donations and my kids are using them every day. It really makes a huge difference. I've received so many that other teachers at my school have been able to pick use class sets for their own students. Reddit is truly a great place - thanks a ton to everyone who volunteered their money and resources. You are all great people.

I recently purchased a Wii U, and as such I no longer need my (original) Wii. It's about a year old, it's in ""like new"" condition (as, honestly, I hardly ever played it). I would like it to go to a family that can make good use of it, especially if there's one out there who might be struggling a little this year to buy gifts for Christmas.

What I am offering:

1) A Wii console in ""like new"" condition, with the cables needed to hook it up to (most?) TVs.

2) A couple of controllers.

3) A game or two (if you let me know what type of games your family would use, I would be happy to purchase a couple of them and include it.)

4) I'll obviously cover the cost of shipping it to you.

My family (wife, 18-month-old, and another little one on the way) have been very blessed recently and I thought instead of just selling this back to GameStop so they can make a profit, I would pay it forward and help out another family that could really benefit from it.

Please include a little information about yourself if you would like to be considered, you can post the details publicly, or just post a general comment on here and include the details in a private message. Again, I will be giving additional consideration to anyone with children; I'll also probably be more likely to ""believe"" you if you are a long-time Redditor (sorry, hope that's okay...I've never posted in this subreddit before so let me know if that's against the rules).

So...let me know if you are interested. Thanks!

EDIT: I've already received some submissions from folks. I will probably take submissions for consideration for the next 24 hours or so, then pick someone and let you know. Sorry if I can't reply to everyone right away, I'll be away from my computer for the rest of the afternoon.

EDIT 2 (Wed evening): Just wanted to say thanks to everyone for all the kind words of support that have been offered. We have been reading every post, so if you have submitted one for consideration, rest assured that we have read it and added you to the growing list. In the end it will be very hard to decide, we will probably just narrow it down to a few and then have to choose randomly. Only wish that we could help out everyone. I'll update the post tomorrow late morning after everyone has had a chance to put in their request and we'll let you know who's going to receive it.

EDIT 3: Thanks to everyone who submitted their story to us for consideration. It was simply too hard for us to choose, so we narrowed it down and then just picked out of a hat. The name we drew was **comhcinc** (who sent us their information via PM). I'll PM them with further information.

This is from [her donation site](http://www.giveforward.com/heidipumpkinpiefund):

&gt;This fund will be used to pay off the large sum of medical bills I have that insurance refused to cover for my final I.C. diagnosis.


&gt;2.5 years ago I started having chronic pain everyday. Doctor after doctor would tell me nothing was wrong and send me to another doctor or specialist. Test after test would show nothing was wrong and would result in more tests. I finally found a doctor willing to listen that this was not all in my head and he did 2 final tests and diagnosed me with Interstitial Cystitis. If you are unfamiliar, it is commonly called I.C. or chronic painful bladder syndrome. The wonderful news is with supplements, a night time medication, diet, and physical therapy, I have been living pain free since September 12, 2012!

&gt;The medical bills have been the biggest point of stress in my life. I pay them on time every month and always pay as much as possible on them, but with some of the tests being in the thousands of dollars, and having to see multiple doctors with insurance claiming it is a pre-existing condition, those bills are now totaling in the $10,000 range. I hate to ask for anything, and I don't want to ask for much, but I would genuinely appreciate your donation to making a headway towards not having these medical bills drown me anymore. I hope that one day, some day, somehow I can repay your kindness. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

&gt;I also hope that this will raise awareness for Interstitial Cystitis patients everywhere. It's a traumatizing experience to go through and extremely painful days and nights without sleep sometimes, the bills just add to the stress causing the pain to flare more from being unrelaxed. Please educate yourself and others on I.C. it goes undiagnosed in women and men everyday.

As I said, she has no idea that I'm posting this and I want it to stay that way. She was always there for me when we were younger and I haven't been able to be there for her much in the past few years, so maybe this will make up for some of that.

So here's my wish:,Avien,77,6,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/tiqq6/rk_todays_my_1_year_cake_day_so_heres_my_wish/,"I know you're supposes to karma whore for your cake day, and I'm sure I'll be making some comments later. However, since this is the only community I help Moderate I felt like I should tell you what RK means to me and what I hope it can become.

Everybody who gives something here, no matter how minor or insignificant it seems, just reinforces in me the that humans are inherently good. In a world that is filled with conflict, selfishness, and greed you all come here to stick out the helping hand.

We empathize with each other, we know what it feels like to walk in others' shoes, and so we give what we can, when we can. These little things add up. They may seem small or insignificant, but every flair you see is someone giving or receiving help; sometimes both. That my friends, is a lot of kindness.

But we, can do, better. 

My one hope for this subreddit is to see this community unify to an even greater extent.

When we ask you about things you want, things you don't like, or things this subreddit can do better, I want to see 100 replies and 1,000 upvotes.

I want to see the ideas the community really feels strongly about being brought up without provocation by us Mods.

They say there's nothing in this world worse than wasted talent. We have generosity, the member base, and the message to really be *the* place on reddit for people to give and take kindness with no strings attached.

So what's stopping us?

On one hand, organization. On the other, the desire to really, really want it.

So this is what I propose. Don't be afraid to make [RK] threads and talk about the state of the subreddit. We can't help if we don't know what people want/expect.

Even if you personally have no desire to fulfill a request, help by pointing these people in the right direction. Give them helpful tips on people, places on the Internet, or other subreddits they can use to find the help they're looking for.

We have 5 Moderators here that would love to hear private feedback should you not wish to create a public thread. Use us to bounce ideas off of.

That is my cake-day wish. 

Even if I inspired just one person on here to give more or be more active in this subreddit, I consider that a wish come true.",,False,self,t5_2szh3,True,,10Kmod,True,t3_tiqq6,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/tiqq6/rk_todays_my_1_year_cake_day_so_heres_my_wish/,

To celebrate we're announcing the RandomKindness Holiday Give-Away!

This event will function exactly like our 10k and Halloween Give Aways only this time we hope to get more people to give away presents!

**Date and/or Timing**

* The List of Gifts will go up **December 25th** at 4pm U.S. Eastern Time
* If you disagree with the time of the Give-away, please comment in the thread and say way.

Place | Time | Time Zone

U.S.A. - New York | Tuesday, December 25, 2012 at 4:00:00 PM    EST | UTC-5 hours

**How to sign up to OFFER:**

* Send me (Avien) a **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Avien)** if you would like to Offer
* Mention 'Give-away' in the Title
* Tell me the state or country you live in (for time zone conflicts)
* Say what you would be willing to OFFER
* Say if you would be willing to ship to a different country
* **Multiple Offers:** If you sign up to OFFER, you can have as many offers as you would like.
* Upon receiving your PM, I will add your name to this thread, but not mention your gift.

**What you can give:**

* Anything!
* In the past we had people offering, Steam Games, gift certificates, board games, books, homemade pottery, homemade jewelry, food, clothes, etc.

**How to claim a gift:**

* On December 25th at 4pm EST, either I or SirLlama will create a new thread listing all the OFFERS under each giver's name

* The giver's name will be hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name, you will go straight to Private Message and can then request the item from that giver.

* **Multiple Requests:** I can not enforce 'first-come-first-served' so I will leave it up to the giver to decide who they want to give their OFFER to (normal RK Offering procedure).

**Giver Instructions:**

* To avoid as much confusion as possible I ask that each Giver both **a)** Confirms with the recipient that they will get said gift and **b)** PM me back saying that your Offer has been taken **and who has taken it**. This will allow me to 'strike-through' the offer. Thus minimizing the amount of duplicate requests you get for the already fulfilled gift. While also allowing me to keep track of who has received gifts.

* **Sending Gifts:** **DO NOT** send gifts immediately. The way the contest is currently built, it allows members to request multiple gifts, very easily. We do not want 2 members walking away with every gift.

* **Fair warning to Givers:** Please check out the person you plan on giving to. Please be wary of members with 1 Link 0 Comment karma made on accounts between now and the date of the Gift-Away (0-3 days). Check their comment histories to see if they're active in RandomKindness. Or if they applied for RK Flair.


**Gift-away Rules:**

* **Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However, every giver will report to me the names of those who they gave their gift to. If I find out that a member has been given more than one gift, it is grounds for a ban and I will instruct the giver to offer it up to someone else.

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts, immediately PM the giver and ask that they chose someone else. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE REPORTED FOR SCAMMING**

* **Scamming:** Seriously, don't do it. Many of our sister subreddits share a ban list together. In addition to a RandomKindness ban you can bet that all other 'helping subreddits' will refuse to help you.

**Incentives to be a Holiday Giver:**

* To give some holiday cheer on the nicest day of the year
* Bring web traffic to our community
* Special red and Green Holiday Medal (**Note:** Halloween Givers *WILL* receive their medals as well, we are actively working on implementing multiple medals into the flair system)

Well I think that's everything! Please help by upvoting this post, for which i receive no karma, and sign up today!

* [Weekend #1](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/lj6so/offer_one_steam_game_once_a_weekend_every_weekend/)

How it works:

* Setup your Steam Wishlist with games you want. This is the most important.
* Post your Steam community ID URL in the comment. I would VERY MUCH appreciate you posting a SteamID64 link so that just in case you change it, I won't get a dead link. You can use SteamRep to get the proper link.
* Wait until Sunday night where I pick one person and they get a random game from their wishlist!

Notes:

* I'm keeping a personal limit of $50 per person. Please don't abuse the system by putting only one $49.99 game in your wishlist. I will skip you.
* If your Reddit OR Steam account looks like an alternate account, I will skip you. I don't want multiple entries.
* I will be GIFTING you the game, not TRADING it. If I trade it to you, then you can possibly turn around and trade it away for something else. That's not the point here. You get the game.

**Any post with a SteamID link will be considered an entry!**

**This weekends winner not only gets a game on their wishlist, but also one random game on sale this weekend!**

1358770970.0,68,self.RandomKindness,16zhjp,[REQUEST][WW] - Postcards for a class of 6 year olds in Japan,kecchin,75,7,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/16zhjp/requestww_postcards_for_a_class_of_6_year_olds_in/,"Hello all. I teach at an International Kindergarten in Japan. The teacher who has the class of 6 year olds is just entering a thematic unit where the kids are learning about all the countries of the world. This is a culmination of their 4 and 5 year old classes covering each of the continents by itself. These are, by and large, Japanese children who have been in an English immersion program since they were as young as 1 year old.

She has a wonderful hand-drawn map donated by a teacher from another school in her classroom, and would really like to help the kids fill it with postcards from everywhere in the world. She reached out on Facebook, but I offered to post on Reddit, hoping to reach a few places she might not get things from otherwise. She says that the first day they showed the kids the map, they spent a half hour asking her, ""Can we get a postcard from Finland?"" ""How about money from Vanautu?"" ""Hey, I want something from Greece, Greenland, Guam, the Northpole...""

Anyway - she gave me the greenlight to copy/paste her facebook message here, and would be very appreciative of any postcards, etc that could be sent to her class. I don't know that she can post a picture with the kids (privacy concerns) - but I may be able to talk her into a photo of the finished product or of a thank you sign from the kids. 

-- copied message -- 

My name is Ruth and I am a Kindergarten teacher. I’d like to take a minute or two of your precious time, to tell you about a project my class and I are working on, called IT’S A SMALL WORLD AFTER ALL. We happen to have a beautiful hand-drawn world map sitting in our classroom that we’d like to put to good use. For our topic World Geography, we are looking to collect post cards or currencies (the lowest valued kind) from all over the world that we will pin onto the map. I know it’s a lot to ask, but please send us anything via post. Anything I receive in the mail, I will open with my students. It will be an interesting way for them to learn more about our beautiful countries of the world. I have no idea how many postcards or different currencies we will collect but it’s worth the effort. We already have currencies of the U.S, Kenya, Korea, Australia and Malaysia. It is already a success, but YOU can help us make it memorable and exciting. Imagine being 6 years old in Japan and receiving a postcard from Iceland, Kenya, Australia and so on. Imagine learning about currencies of the World, and how we are all connected and can access any part of the world by post. I’m sure they’ll remember it for the rest of their lives. Who knows, it might even help create world peace in the future. I know we’re all busy with life, and for that, I appreciate your time and effort. Please share the same with your friends. We are living in a SMALL world, after all.

Thank you!

I'll be doing them five slots at a time. Typically it takes me 1-2 days to make a hat. You may request any colors, and one of the following styles:

Simple beanie/toque
Hat with earflaps
Slouchy hat
Puff stitch hat

Please specify if you'd like a pompon, and on Earflap hats whethere you'd like braided ties.

If you would like to donate to shipping costs or the yarn fund, my PayPal is ivybeleaguer@gmail.com but repeat, THIS IS NOT NECESSARY! Although it is helpful since I'm a broke single mom myself. :p

You may suggest other styles of hats and I will let you know if they are a viable option.

How fitting eh!?!? Yep, I am asking you to stop by this link and nominate her for the hero of reddit 2011. She's given a ton of pizzas, she gave Christmas gifts to an astronomical amount of reddit kids. She's helped in a lot of ways. I'd like for her to feel as loved and appreciated as she really is :)

You know what makes her so damn deserving beside the aweomeness I shared above??? Simple, Glinda is so humble and down to Earth. She gives from the depths of her soul and a lot of times on the quiet tip in the backgrounds. She does what she does, gives all she gives and could care less about the recognition. She'd tell you ""it's nothing special"" but come on redditors, we KNOW it is damn special and we are lucky to be amongst her awesomeness.""

She is an amazing little girl who is passionate about changing the world, and I thought maybe some of you might help make her birthday extra special by granting her wish. All you need to do is pick up some garbage, and if you have a Facebook account you can attend her birthday event and even leave her a message.

You guys are legen-- wait for it...

So after a year of financial collapse etc we found ourselves slightly worse off than we were last year. We couldn't even afford to see our friends' newborn baby, which was so long ago he's not even newborn any more. So instead of buying me some artefact of consumerism to be forgotten in a year she gave me the best thing she could think of: you guys.

Here's a picture of all the awesome stuff I got:

http://i.imgur.com/yncTC.jpg

Seriously, there are cards from Switzerland, Canada and the USA here. You guys went all out.

Let me tell you about some of the things!

**reddit alien in a tardis** - An awesome picture by frcanadawelsh with a card lamenting her lack of money to buy things with and having to resort to making things! Guys, buying things *is* resorting. There is in my opinion no better gift than one you make yourself. This painting is both awesome and unique! Thank you &lt;3

**the mysterious redditor** - Well! Someone aroused my suspicions by arriving at the door with a package but no uniform on Monday. Inside that package turned out to be a hamper (even the basket is awesome) full of awesome retro sweets and awesome kitty treats for my awesome kitties and the other kitty. Teasing :3 THEY ARE ALL MONSTERS.

This mystery redditor was given away, once I thought about it, by the lack of postage on the box and the lack of apparent affiliation with any particular courier. But this chap went out of his way to hand-deliver a most bodacious confection selection along with a card with a reddit alien sticker as the signature. Most compelling! However, we don't know who it really was, but then again that is probably the point :)

Thank you mystery redditor! I'm slightly glad I buggered up my signature!

**a fiver** - I'm saving the best story for last. You see, I received a card from a nice lady called strawberrylime just over a week ago and because I didn't know whom it was from and because I am a badass I disregarded the do-not-open-until-birthday instructions and rent asunder the feeble wood pulp defence system that encased it! Interred within: five English pounds.

On that day I had been worried because I couldn't justify the expense of even cooperating fully in the Secret Santa at the office; a £5 expense that everyone should be able to cover. And just in time a little angel sent me exactly the required moolah to do that. So I did go unto Morrisons, where I bought some ice cream cones and those chocolate tubey things you suck coffee through; and I brought them home and my amazing wife transformed them into **ICE CREAM CONE CAKE POPS**. Amazing, but the story does not stop here.

You see, at the Christmas party last year I was equally down in the dumps for the same financial reasons as I had been this year, and I had copped out by buying a box and filling it with sweets for that year's recipient. This year, though, I felt I had nailed it with the ice cream cake idea. 

Nailed it perfectly! When the presents were opened after dinner, her face lit up when she figured out what I'd got her (I'd accidentally left my email open so she discovered I was her Santa). I have seriously never seen anyone so happy to receive something. So naturally her joy was infectious and cheered everyone up, including me. A simple, home-made gift, but just the right gift, turned me from my normal miserable self into a fun and happy man for a night. I even danced! In front of my workmates! I do so love to make people happy.

So thank you especially to strawberrylime, another humble gifter whose contribution was far greater than she had expected it could be.

And thank you to everyone who participated; even the words inside the cards have helped lift my spirits this year. Thank you Jess for calling me a demigod -- I wouldn't call my clumsy flailings at walls ""parkour"" but thanks all the same. Thanks to the various people who are under the shared delusion that I am a great guy. Thanks to whoever's in Maine for making me jump with a noisy card (I'd forgotten they existed!). Thanks to everyone, just for taking the time. You all got me a thing I can't put a price on, and a thing I'll never lose (barring Alzheimer's): a memory.

Thanks for waiting for it.

***I WANT TO BUY YOU SOMETHING YOU WANT FOR $30 OR LESS!***
***I WANT TO BUY YOU SOMETHING YOU WANT FOR $30 OR LESS!***


As I said above, I will be running a contest in the r/randomkindness community, in honor of their special day, where I will buy an item worth up to $30 for one lucky redditor who participates in the Random Kindness Contest! 


***To be qualified*** for to be entered into the contest you must do the following:

* Have an active reddit account that is more than 2 months old. 

* In a PM or in your comment, tell me you want to be entered into the contest, so i know who i need to put in the raffle.  

* In the comments of The Contest Post, tell me what you want me to get you that is worth up to $30! If you could give a short explanation as to why you have chosen your particular gift, i think it would really add a lot to the contest!

The contest will end at 9:00AM November 28th, 2011. This will give people time to enter that may have missed out on the post. 


I will put all of the usernames who have agreed to particiapate in the contest into a set and then letting the computer randomly select one of the entires to be our winner. 

* The winner has 24 hours to message me and confirm that he still wants to go through with the gift. If the winner does not respond within 24 hours another name wil be drawn at random until a winner is found.  

And it's that easy!

EDIT 1: OHHH I'm pretty pumped about this. I already really enjoy all the things you are suggesting. Keep them coming.

(x-post from /r/Assistance)",chompyzombie,82,19,30,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/1jkaqj/requestww_my_entire_life_changed_overnight_i_am/,"I posted on /r/Assistance last night and someone suggested I try here as well. Typing it out the first time was not an easy thing for me to do emotionally, so instead of typing it out again I hope you don't mind me just cutting and pasting my previous post:  

  
  
  .  .  .  .

This is hard to talk about, I haven't really told anyone in my life about this yet. I'm humiliated. But if people are going to be generous enough to help, I should be up front and open I am willing to provide any personal info you need and I can provide proof as well.  
  
  
I'm a stay-at-home mom of 2 kids and pregnant with baby #3, due Oct 15th. My boyfriend (who is more of a husband, been together for 10 years) is the father of my children and an IT Engineer and we lived a happy and comfortable life.  
  

Until this Monday, my little sister came to my house and told me the worst news of my life. My boyfriend had went over her house and fixed her internet. He installed a new router for her in her bedroom. When she inspected it when he left she discovered a hidden camera, it was pointed at her bed. I fell apart, in tiny pieces, I just lost it. I confronted him and he admitted it, there was no way he could deny it with the proof my sister had. I kicked him out, I couldn't even look at him anymore. I felt like I didn't know him and that is terrifying, it's given me so much anxiety.  
  
My sister called the police. He lost his job and he's probably going to prison for a long time. I don't have a job, I'm in my third trimester...I'm not going to be able to get one for awhile. I'm freaking out at the idea of not being able to provide for my children. I have lots of crying spells throughout the day. I run into my laundry room and hide from my kids I want to protect them from this as much as possible but I know they are going to ask questions about where daddy is and why things are so different now. I'm so scared.  
  
Anyways, so this week I've taken steps to try to get independent. I've applied for emergency assistance and food stamps. Even though he isn't working right now I've still applied for child support. I have all this paperwork I can scan if requested. I'm using the little savings we have to move out of our single family home into a cheaper apartment. I have one more month left here.  
  

The only problem is I've stalled on getting stuff for the baby. I was going to see what I could get 2nd hand from people and then purchase the rest in the next month or two. I did get some stuff already like a swing, high chair and crib (no mattress) and some 0-3 m clothes, but there are so many little things I don't have and I just won't be able to afford in time. If I could just make sure I have the essentials, I will be able to breathe a little easier.
  

I've made a list of the things I need. LET ME SAY I WILL ALSO GLADLY ACCEPT 2ND HAND DONATIONS OF THESE SAME ITEMS, ESPECIALLY 3-6M CLOTHES. (Update: thanks to your kindness I now think I will have enough of this size!) My list only includes necessities and I tried to choose the least expensive in each category. Oh, when I kicked him out he took his clothes and also took half of the silverware and cups we had so I also added the cheapest ones I could find to that list because we don't have enough now. I don't care about nice things, I just want something. It will help me out so much and I promise if and when I do get back on my feet I promise I will return the favor to someone else on this board. Wow, I just realized how much I typed and I'm sorry! I guess I was just venting. Here is the link, like I said it's a list of what I need but if anyone has any used items it would be appreciated too: http://amzn.com/w/9HA0CHQIW2OG  
  
**EDIT** Someone told me to create a Walmart wish list as well because items are usually cheaper there. I was able to find some of the same items for cheaper on there, here is the link: http://www.walmart.com/giftregistry/gr_detail.do?registryId=26772143173

Four-year-old Ruby desperately needs your help.

This week Ruby's family received the devastating news that Ruby's cancer has returned and the only course of treatment to save her young life is to return to America for Proton Therapy.

Over 18months ago Ruby Owen from Stoke-on-Trent underwent Proton Treatment Therapy in the United States to try and remove an aggressive form of cancer on her brain.

The treatment was a success and Ruby survived, returning home to her family in the UK in August 2010; but this week the Owen family received the news they had feared the most, that the Cancer had returned.

And now, 4-year-old Ruby faces another desperate fight for life after Doctors told the family that treatment in the UK could not save her life.

Sorry if this is probably the wrong subreddit for someting like this, any point in the right direction would be very much appreciated.

It's a long story but I suppose I'll cut it as short as I can. My father is of arab decent and I was raised as an American, and never really learned anything about my culture or my father's family's history. About a year ago during Ramadan I was invited to come visit and spend the month in Jordan with my family. I had a great time and really got into the whole culture difference thing, my father offered to support me as I stayed for a year to learn the arabic language and basically learn everything I missed when I was growing up with my mother instead of my father.

Before this I was staying with my father for a year prior to moving to Jordan, it wasn't until this past month that I found my father had no intentions of bringing me back to America, as he has sold his house, sold my car, all of my beloginings back in the states, while it wasn't much, it was everything I had ever owned up to that point in my life. Basically, he told me to forget about moving back to America, that I should stay in Jordan and enjoy this life instead.

Needless to say, this was a huge shock that has basically left me an anxious mess . we've been fighting daily and finally it boiled over yesterday after a particalarly bad fight resulting in things becoming physical and with that he purchased me a plane ticket and told me to pack my things and that I am never welcome back to his home or his family's.

I'm not going to lie reddit, I've never been more scared in my life, I have no contacts, no friends, no car, and no money. All I have is a suitcase of clothes and my laptop. I have no idea what I can do, or what support is available to me when I come back to the states.

I beg you reddit, please help me and point me in any useful direction possible. I am competely lost.
Also, like I said at the top, this is probably the wrong place for this.. 

Where else can I post this? 

Thank you reddit.

However, we do have all the fixings for a decent Thanksgiving dinner (turkey, pumpkin pie, stuffing, green bean casserole, mashed potatoes, etc). 

There are only three of us (me, my husband, and our almost 14 month old daughter), but we have enough food to feed us and probably another 3 people. So, I thought, why not have someone over for Thanksgiving dinner?

Here's how this would work:

-It's going to be held at our apartment in Vancouver, WA. 

-This offer is for up to a maximum of 3 people (so we're talking a single person, couple, or a couple with 1 child, possibly 2 if they're littler.....). We'd take more if we could but then I'd be afraid we wouldn't be able to feed all of you properly, lol. 

-You have to be able to find your own way here. If you're super close and have no transportation I could probably come get you, but I have limited gas monies for the rest of the month so I'm limited in that department unfortunately.

-I would prefer this offer goes to someone who really needs it, but if you just don't want to be alone for Thanksgiving that's ok too. We've all been there, and it sucks to be alone on the holidays.

-Finally, and most importantly, you have to be able to give me verification that what you're telling me is true. I give people the benefit of the doubt most often but because you'd be coming into our home and would be around our young daughter.....I have to know that you're not a crazy serial killer or something.

Dan is the owner of a small auto shop in Charlotte, NC, where I get my car serviced. You can check out their website here: http://www.touringcarinc.com/

Dan has a blood disease that has evaded diagnosis. The cause is unknown, but the chief symptom is that he is not producing enough  red blood cells. Because they can't fix the problem, the only treatment they have had success with so far is getting him transfusions. He has been getting them every couple weeks for about a year- Or at least he had, until his insurance reached the maximum allowable benefit. I don't know the exact details, but I do know there is a 60 day period where he can not afford treatment, and is not covered by any insurance. So, he is not able to get treatment.

I saw him last week, and he is getting worse... he was somewhat lethargic, pale and jaundiced. 

What I am asking is a few things:
1. If you live in the Charlotte NC area, and have a european car, take it to this guy for service. Dan runs a great shop, and having his business do a bit better would probably help take a load off. They also are a lot cheaper than the dealerships (at least for Mercedes), and do as good or better quality work.
2. If you are able and feel so inclined, find the business address on the website and send him a check so that he can get some medical treatment.
3. If you feel so inclined, write a letter to your congressman telling them about this man, who has worked all his life, owns his own business, and because he got sick is unable to afford health insurance. The health insurance system is failing this middle class guy, and endangering his life.

I wish I could help this guy out, but I am trying to live off a graduate student's stipend, so the only thing I was able to do for him was #1 and #3, as well as write my local paper hoping that they carry the story.

The Gift-Away can't work properly if people can't see what's already claimed. They see what's already claimed because the Giver has PM'd me telling me the offer was taken and by whom it was taken. Remember to delay giving the person the gift to prevent people taking multiple gifts. Be cautious when deciding who to give to.

Also, because of the amount of Offers I have received **there will be two threads of OFFERS**. Please make sure that you Upvote both threads for easy recognition.

Good luck everyone!

**Update #2:** I've received a lot of feedback from the members and I believe pushing the Gift-Away back to Friday will give everyone ample enough time to consider giving and requesting.  And with 30+ people gifting over 100+ gifts, this is sure to be one heck of a Gift-Away! To be clear, **the Gift-Away is now at Noon on Friday.**

**Update:** We are nearing 10,000 subscribers and the amount of offers are absolutely astounding! On the day we hit 10,000 subscribers I will post this thread around ~~5pm U.S. Eastern time~~. The reason being that this should allow anyone who works to already be home to attend their offer. The thread itself will stay open for however long it takes to exhaust most offers. It could be 2 hours, it could be 2 days.

RandomKindness has reached almost 10,000 subscribers! Yay!

To celebrate this small yet significant milestone, we Mods wanted to give something back to you guys in the form of a varietal 'first-come-first serve' gift-away.

However, because we are so very few, and there are a lot of subscribers, we thought it would be a kind gesture to open it up and allow anyone to sign up for the gift-giving bonanza!

I think it would be a nice surprise if we spent the next day or two signing members up, then taking OFFERS privately. 

That way, on the day we actually hit 10,000 we can post everything and surprise everyone!

**Date and/or Timing**

* Hopefully we'll hit 10,000 members on a Friday or Saturday this weekend for ease of management.
* **Please comment below expressing interest or concern for a static day to celebrate reaching 10k subscribers** (I may just chose a day depending on member opinion)

**How to sign up to OFFER:**

* Send me (Avien) a **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Avien)** if you would like to Offer
* Mention 'Gift-away' in the Title
* Say what you would be willing to OFFER
* **Multiple Offers:** If you sign up to OFFER, you can have as many offers as you would like.
* Upon receiving your PM, I will add your name to this thread, but not mention your gift.

**How to claim a gift:**

* On the day we hit 10,000, or this weekend (by my rough guesstimate), I will create a new thread listing all the OFFERS under each giver's name

* The giver's name will be hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name, you will go straight to Private Message and can then request the item from that giver.

* **Multiple Requests:** I can not enforce 'first-come-first-served' so I will leave it up to the giver to decide who they want to give their OFFER to (normal RK Offering procedure).

**Giver Instructions:**

* To avoid as much confusion as possible I ask that each Giver both **a)** Confirms with the recipient that they will get said gift and **b)** PM me back saying that your Offer has been taken **and who has taken it**. This will allow me to 'strike-through' the offer. Thus minimizing the amount of duplicate requests you get for the already fulfilled gift. While also allowing me to keep track of who has received gifts.

* **Sending Gifts:** **DO NOT** send gifts immediately. The way the contest is currently built, it allows members to request multiple gifts, very easily. We do not want 2 members walking away with every gift.

* **Fair warning to Givers:** Please check out the person you plan on giving to. Please be wary of members with 1 Link 0 Comment karma made on accounts between now and the date of the Gift-Away (0-3 days). Check their comment histories to see if they're active in RandomKindness. Or if they applied for RK Flair.


**Gift-away Rules:**

* **Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However, every giver will report to me the names of those who they gave their gift to. If I find out that a member has been given more than one gift, it is grounds for a ban and I will instruct the giver to offer it up to someone else.

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts, immediately PM the giver and ask that they chose someone else. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE REPORTED FOR SCAMMING**

* **Scamming:** Seriously, don't do it. Many of our sister subreddits share a ban list together. In addition to a RandomKindness ban you can bet that all other 'helping subreddits' will refuse to help you.

**Incentives to be a 10k Gifter:**

* Help revitalize the RK Community
* My first-born child
* Custom Flair of some sort. We're working out the feasibility of a new medal or perhaps some simple text '10k Giver'
* Because all the cool kids are doing it (Special RK appearance by everyone's favorite helper: [Glinda_da_Good_Witch](http://www.reddit.com/user/Glinda_da_Good_Witch/) and the Steam Lord: [Briguy9876](http://www.reddit.com/user/Briguy9876). As well as myself, and uber cool RK design Mod [annelysa](http://www.reddit.com/user/annelysa/).

Well I think that's everything! Please help by upvoting this post, for which i receive no karma, and sign up today!

He was essentially my Dad. Yes, my ""father"" is still alive, but my step dad (Michael) was my daddy. And yeah, we miss him a lot. I know today is a very hard day for my mom, so I'm essentially just asking for some redditors to e-mail her today. I've created a new and blank e-mail so that she can login and see all the messages from you. 

Just something encouraging, anything you would want. ""I'm sorry for your loss."" is good enough. Anything more would be great. Tell her it gets better. Tell her someone likes her. (me and my 2 sisters love her to pieces.)

Someone eager to help but also understands what this subreddit is about. Its about random acts of kindness not necessarily helping out the needy. Someone who has been involved with the subreddit, even if just as a commenter.

 **In summary** 

 You should believe what this community stands for and be active. 
 
 You should have some community management experience. 

 You should be able to manage things in a kind way.

 You should also state what times you are likely to be available (in GMT please)
 
 You should make your case of modship right here in comments and we will let the community decide, however final decision will be made by current group of mods.

 **What do you need to do as a mod?** 

 Making sure scammers &amp; bullies stay off the sub-reddit
 
 or Managing spam &amp; reports
 

* **REMINDER : UPVOTE ALL GOOD THINGS**
---------------------------------------------
 Remember that our random acts of kindness are only visible to world when these are upvoted more. It makes me sad when I see an offer with 120 comments and just 20 upvotes.

* [Weekend #2](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/lta6b/offerwww_steam_game_giveaway_weekend_2/)

How it works:

* Setup your Steam Wishlist with games you want. This is the most important.
* Post your Steam community ID URL in the comment. I would VERY MUCH appreciate you posting a SteamID64 link so that just in case you change it, I won't get a dead link. You can use SteamRep to get the proper link.
* Wait until Sunday night where I pick one person and they get a random game from their wishlist!

Notes:

* I'm keeping a personal limit of $50 per person. Please don't abuse the system by putting only one $49.99 game in your wishlist. I will skip you.
* If your Reddit OR Steam account looks like an alternate account, I will skip you. I don't want multiple entries.
* I will be GIFTING you the game, not TRADING it. If I trade it to you, then you can possibly turn around and trade it away for something else. That's not the point here. You get the game.

**Any post with a SteamID link will be considered an entry!**

1359650432.0,54,self.RandomKindness,17mwlj,"[REQUEST] Need to get my foster sister and her two kids out of an abusive household in Syracuse, NY and home to New Hampshire",calyx13,66,12,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/17mwlj/request_need_to_get_my_foster_sister_and_her_two/,"This is a long convoluted story but I will try to consolidate it as much as possible. Growing up my parents were foster parents to many kids through the years. The girl I'm talking about (I'll call her Lisa) was with us on and off for years and I consider her family. 

Lisa is now 21 and has two kids. She has had her share of hard knocks but remains a good kid who adores her children. She has had intermittent contact with her biological mother (I'll call her Bitch) who is pretty much evil. Bitch tries to convince Lisa that she is a bad daughter, a bad mother, a bad person. Bitch is HIV positive and regularly guilts Lisa into giving her money and taking care of her (despite abandoning Lisa with her abusive father when Lisa was 4 years old).

Lisa holds onto hope that her mother will change and that she will eventually love Lisa. Unfortunately this is really common with foster kids - the hope that if they are just good enough, successful enough, nice enough...their bio-parents will stop being pieces of shit and will love them and parent them.

Fast forward to now - Bitch had surgery last week and convinced Lisa to come take care of her while she was recuperating. In short order she started pulling her usual shit - screaming at Lisa, blaming her for being in pain, etc. Lisa tried to leave with the kids but Bitch grabbed Lisa's oldest daughter and refused to let her go. The police were called and Bitch was told to keep her hands off the kids. 

Lisa is stuck in Syracuse with a 3-month old and a 3-year with no car and almost no money. Even if I could send bus tickets she has too much stuff (car seats, portable crib, etc.). I am worried that her mother will start being physically abusive to Lisa again. 

I know this is totally unlikely but if anyone was coming from Syracuse to anywhere near my town (even 20-30 miles away, I could go get her) I would Paypal gas money + extra reimbursement. I just want to get her out of there, and home. 

**tl;dr - My foster sister and her two kids are stuck in Syracuse, NY with my foster sister's abusive biological mother. I need to get them home to New Hampshire.**




**EDIT** Alltheowls has awesomely offered to bring her to a town very near me if someone could get her &amp; the kids to the VT/NY border. If anyone is up for this please let me know. I am happy to reimburse gas costs, of course!

What I'm looking for is someone with those free airline miles. I'm not entirely sure how that works so I might just be barking up the wrong tree altogether.

Details: I moved away from my family but I did not anticipate just how much my nieces would miss me. This is sorta one of those ""you don't miss it until it's gone"" deal. One of my sisters is paying for her kid to come see me (she arrives on Saturday with my parents for a week-long visit!!!) but my other sister doesn't quite have her life on track and can't (I think it's really ""won't"" but that's a whole 'nother story) pay for her kid to fly out. This niece has been begging for months for me to fly back home but I just can't afford it. I started a whole new life here and got laid off from my job within 6 months and it took 4 more months to find another and I'm just trying to get settled.

SO, this is where you guys come in. I just want to go home for a little visit in (maybe?) August since her birthday is August 4th. Thursday or Friday to Monday sounds nice and I'd basically be flying from one side of the country to another. (USA)

I can give specific cities, verification, and whatever else if anyone can help me out. 

Please feel free to offer any other suggestion as well. At worst, I'll just have to wait another year or so until I can save up some money for a ticket. Thanks, all. You guys are the best.

PS Sorry if the format is shit, don't usually do this kind of thing very often.

EDIT1: So 'crudapples' has offered to share his download page for the Humble Indie Bundle V. I appreciate his/her intentions but I think that if you want the games, you should at least donate some money to the game devs, by buying the bundle.
Even if it's just a cent for the download page, it's better than nothing.
But I do understand that people don't have paypal/credit cards, so I have a little bit of cash left in my paypal account, if someone wants me to buy them their own personal Humble Indie Bundle V download page (Non-Steam/DRM Free.), so PM me.
Really though, if you have a credit card, you should buy it, they deserve it as this is the best Indie Bundle they've released. (IMO.)
I can offer this as well, I have almost every single Humble Indie Bundles, and a couple of other indie bundle download pages.
If you can promise me this, that if you like the game, than you will buy it, than I won't mind if you send me a PM with what Indie Bundle Download page you want.

EDIT2: Sorry for taking so long to respond to a lot of you guys, I just bought Red Dead Redemption, so been wiped from the planet of the internet.

EDIT3: I apologize for not choosing any winners yet, my sister in-law had an accident so I'm typing this up before leaving, I promise will do this first thing tomorrow morning.

Also, please don't feel like any amount of money is ""too little"".  Even $1 would be a great help since it adds up over time



This is the family dog I grew up with, so technically he's my mom's dog (but just because he lives with her, doesn't mean he's not *mine*).





He's 12 years old and such a spunky little guy.  He's so full of life, and it's not his time to go.  We cannot afford the $820+ for surgery (estimated cost for removal of tumor, plus blood work and medication, but the vet said in the end it could end up costing more).






I set up a verified ***paypal at HelpSavePeanut@yahoo.com*** just a few minutes ago, and I'm really hoping some awesome redditors can help.  Even if you can only help with $1, we would be so extremely grateful (plus, it adds up VERY quickly).  Any extra money that isn't used directly for Peanut's care will be donated to either the Humane Society or an animal rescue group (which will be researched on.)




Please post any questions you have, and if the MODS read this before they get my message, please let me know how I can verify (I wouldn't mind sending my phone number to a MOD and talking that way, if it helps)






I am also sending a message to the MODS asking someone to contact me privately so I can give them my phone number and verify everything to prove that I'm being honest.






**SOME INFORMATION ON OUR FAMILY** and mainly why ""just working more"" isn't an option at this point and time.





My parents have 4 children in all, 3 still in the house.  I am the oldest, and the next in line after me is 14 years old.  My little brothers asked me to help them make some posters for the neighborhood for mowing lawns to help get money for Peanut, and they're all going through their stuff right now to see if there's anything they can sell on craigslist to contribute.




My mom has fibromyalgia, bone spurs in her heels, and  lapoma under each shoulder blade (normally a lapoma is not painful, but because of where hers are they are incredibly painful, and because they are so close to her spinal cord surgery is not recommended by any of the surgeons she's seen, and they've all refused doing it themself).  She's in constant pain and already has a hard enough time working 40 hours a week, she wants to go an disability but it would not make enough money to live if she did.





My dad works full time, 12 hour shifts (his ""normal"" schedule is 36 hours one week, 48 the next, but most times he does more, especially on his short weeks).  He tore a ligament in his leg some years ago which still affects his walking a bit (it was down towards his ankle, but I forget the specifics) and working any more than he does is dangerous for his health from lack of sleep and over exhaustion from the job.






I live 2 hours away with my fiance, and am currently a student.  I graduate in a month and then 6-8 weeks from graduation I will be getting my license in the mail, at which time I can start working legally in my career.  Until then, I already have a job lined up near my parents house with my old employer (she jumped at the opportunity to have me back) working longer shifts with the days all together, so that I can stay with my parents during the days I work and head home with my fiance on the days that I don't.  This is honestly the best option for me, because I've had experience with this job I'm making more there than I would anywhere else that I'm qualified for pre-license, and since I'm the top salesgirl I usually jump to most non-manager hours whenever a shift is made.  But I can't start working for a few more weeks, and we're hoping he doesn't have to wait that long.





My fiance is the most amazing man I have ever met, and when he heard of the news he automatically decided that he wanted to put away extra money from his paychecks to go towards Peanut's surgery.  We're cutting back on date nights, he's looking for someone from work to carpool with, and he's also going through our stuff trying to find extra's we can sell on craigslist.



So, reddit, we could use some help.

I work at a local child psychiatric facility which treats kids from age 7(ish) to 18. These kids tend to come from very low socioeconomic classes and aren't used to being given a second thought, let alone some form of kindness. Most of them have family histories of abuse, neglect, rape, ect., so, despite their age, most of them haven't had anything that could be considered a childhood.

It used to be the case that the state would be able to give the kids what most children grow up with--non-second hand toys, an allowance (most of the kids have never handled money before), and so forth. But budget cuts have severely impaired what we, as staff, can do for them outside of the therapy they're there for.

So, here is my plea: anything helps. If you have extra toys, clothing, art supplies--anything that a child could use--please send them. The place is called the Child Study and Treatment Center and is located in Lakewood, WA.


Thanks. Seriously. Thank you.

On June 1st I was putting on a car show event at a place in Dallas called Autosource. We asked the secretary to order 8 pizzas for everyone, and she ordered 80. No lie. 

It was our fault, so we paid for the pizzas... fed them to everyone... but still had 50 or so left over. What to do? No-one was sure what we could do, but I had an idea. 

I asked the owner of the place, Al, if we could borrow one of his cars to fill to the top with pizza, and deliver them to the homeless on the street. He agreed! We choose a Fisker Karama because it was charged, available, and could hold nearly 50 pizzas. What we could not fit in the car was given away via craigslist in the free ad's. 

I took a camera with us to film the delivery, and when I got back and actually got to see the footage I found it very uplifting. I realized that I am a selfish person and I need to do stuff like this far, far more often. 

This was a Random Act of Kindness, and it was very rewarding for me emotionally. My friends who have seen the video agreed, and I figured maybe you guys on Reddit would too. 

Thanks for the Pizzas Autosource. :)

[US, WWW]",wishiwasyou333,77,22,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/zzual/request_help_my_son_rebuild_his_reputation_at/,"My son is 8 years old and a third grader and is in special education because of his behavioral problems.  He has ADHD and some sensory issues which can make learning and interacting with others difficult.  Last year he had a very hard time and was constantly getting into trouble with teachers, staff, and students.  We were in and out of the principal's office 4 times.  At the end of the school year he made a complete turnaround.  He had gotten a handle on his behavior and his teachers started to take notice.  This year has also been really great.  He has had amazing feedback and progress, is doing well in his mainstream classes, and seems to have rebounded from all of the bad things last year.  The reason I am asking for your help is that while he has made a monster comeback, there are some there that are still skeptical.  Last week he was told by another student that he wasn't invited to this kid's birthday party because his mom was worried that he might swear or cause trouble.  My son was very disappointed, but handled it well for being an 8 year old.  I don't want my son to be stuck feeling ashamed of things he did last year.  I want him to believe that he can redeem himself with his good behavior.  I want him to be proud of who he is now.  

This is why I have come to you fine folks.  My son's school is doing a fundraiser with Innisbrook.  They are selling things like wrapping paper, magazines, chocolates, gifts, cookie mixes, etc.  The kicker is that the top selling students at his school will receive a ride in a limo and a pizza party for their class.  They also earn prizes from Innisbrook as well.  If he sells 85 items he will get a Lenovo tablet.  My absolute dream would be seeing his name in the school bulletin and that he might hear his name over the loudspeaker during morning announcements.  It would boost his self esteem and also help to mend his reputation with other students and some of the staff.  It would be nice if he was recognized for something positive instead of the negative.  

Here is the direct link to the site where you can order from.  

http://www.innisbrook.com/credits/index/studentlink?id=R141047H

If you would like to help and order something just click on the link above, then hit ""continue to shop"" on the school confirmation page.  It is going to a really great cause.  His school will use the funds for scholarships to field trips, student events, and supplies for the school as well.

I have experience in many sub-fields of the vast *thing* known as ""IT"", but I am particularly experienced with the items mentioned in the title. 

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development, and have never programmed before.

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, but the ones I'm most familiar with are Java, C++, C# and (for web) PHP/Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway. Please don't contact me if you want to learn a significant amount of any language other than PHP. I consider myself qualified to help you with the basics, but I don't use those languages enough to be an ""expert"" programmer.

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad episode of depression about 2 years back and deleted/destroyed all my digital art + backups, but some of my recent stuff can be seen on my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net). I may not be the best artist/designer around, but if you're a photographer who wants to learn how to do some post-processing to improve their work or someone who wants to learn the basic tools in Photoshop/Illustrator,then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), a microphone, and a decent internet connection. Time zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle East ), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out. I've taught over 45 people in the US so far, ranging from the east coast to the west, and it's not been an issue.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, but teaching, ESPECIALLY when it's computer related, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, for every hour that i teach you, you spend an hour practicing on your own, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: I have 60+ ""students"" on my contact list, over 15 of whom have never even bothered messaging me after the initial add (5-6 never even confirmed the add request). Another couple dozen disappeared after the first class, and I don't think it's because of my teaching, because I've had unanimously positive reviews so far. Some people have given me reasons for why they're busy at the moment and can't take classes, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but please don't just add me on a whim. Good design/programming takes mental effort, and the least you can do in exchange for free classes is to be committed to learning.

**If you're interested, post here for the record, and send me a PM with your Skype ID and a rough idea of what you want to learn. I shall add you asap and we can discuss timings and what not then**.

You can find out a bit more about me from my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net)

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you! I have people spread across a bunch of different time zones, and most of them are busy with work too, so until I get a few dozen students, you're sure to get a slot.

Suddenly, everything in life was no longer a validation of hope, a confirmation of being, a beckoning of an omniscient smileas if all that had occurred in the world had fallen like dominoes in order to bow to a particular moment or succumb to, by all other means, a nonsensical realization. The charm of life was no more than a trail of seduction that birthed its most prized possessions of realityhurt, terror, suffering, impurity, hopelessness. The unknown. In Losing Michael Malone, five characters search for happiness in a time of suffering. Emma is blind to the sunshine that gleams around her each and every day. Maddie witnesses a drained and exhausted marriage. Jack is without solitude in a life of inner conflict and self-loathing. Love and compassion rip and tear through the life of Kathryn. Michael hurts too much to feel anything. Through all of the pain of passion and disease, this cast of characters is on a collision course towards each otherno matter how much they'd like to run away.

Here's my application bio. A few people were asking, 'Why me?' over someone else. A legitimate question.


My entire life I've been working towards a career in space science. I spent years working at one of Canada's only dedicated Space Science and Human Space Flight museums teaching about the wonders of the cosmos. I do research in astrophysics now: I work on the VERITAS experiment, a gamma-ray observatory near Tucson, Arizona. I am participating in Mars simulations (I am the Chief Engineer for the Mars Desert Research Station's Crew 116) and in my free time I like reading and learning about the history of human space flight. My passion for this field allows me to do public outreach with the Astrophysics group at McGill University. I love being able to share my passion with others and get them interested and motivated in such a fantastic field. Being able to go on this adventure would be achieving a life goal.


The current post with the most votes has ~14,000 votes. This is nothing compared to some of the other regions (which have 60,000+). So,  really, support from even a small part of Reddit can really help me out. I'm in second place with just over 1900. 


All you need to do is go to http://aventurespatialemetro.com/view/cs33/THESE_ARE_THE_VOYAGES and click 'voter' (French for 'vote'). No signup, nothing. Just vote. Use your phone, your laptop, your tablet, anything!


Anything you do will really increase my chances of going on this adventure. The contest runs until the end of the month. It's one vote per computer, per day.


This would be a life accomplishment for me. Reddit, please help me! (If anything, please upvote this so that it gets more visibility! This is a self post so karma wouldn't be an issue).


If selected, I promise to do an AMA.


**TL;DR** If you go to http://aventurespatialemetro.com/view/cs33/THESE_ARE_THE_VOYAGES and click 'voter' (French for vote), you can help send me to space.

It's fine that requests are made for a game. But with the impending release of skyrim approaching, all of a sudden the ""cousins"" of the lottery winners are out looking for a handout.

I will give one person and his immediate family a tour of my fire station and apparatus (fire engine), and will put on my bunker gear and SCBA (fire suit to the layperson) so you can see how we look when we go into a fire.  If you have kids and they are around grades 2-5, I can also talk about fire safety.  I am happy to do this for any age group, however, kids within the grades 2-5 tend to have greater attention spans for those topics.  Other things I can do:  show you how a fire hydrant works, turn the fire engine lights and siren on, show you how a thermal imaging camera works, flow water through a fire nozzle.  There probably isn't enough time to do all of those things, but definitely some of them.

I will be on duty, so there is a chance that we might get a call, but they are usually short and we will return ASAP if that happens. 

I am happy to provide proof of my employment and pictures of my engine to serious inquirers.

&gt;2.5 years ago I started having chronic pain everyday. Doctor after doctor would tell me nothing was wrong and send me to another doctor or specialist. Test after test would show nothing was wrong and would result in more tests. I finally found a doctor willing to listen that this was not all in my head and he did 2 final tests and diagnosed me with Interstitial Cystitis. If you are unfamiliar, it is commonly called I.C. or chronic painful bladder syndrome. The wonderful news is with supplements, a night time medication, diet, and physical therapy, I have been living pain free since September 12, 2012!

&gt;The medical bills have been the biggest point of stress in my life. I pay them on time every month and always pay as much as possible on them, but with some of the tests being in the thousands of dollars, and having to see multiple doctors with insurance claiming it is a pre-existing condition, those bills are now totaling in the $10,000 range.

I hope that one day, some day, somehow I can repay your kindness. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

&gt;also hope that this will raise awareness for Interstitial Cystitis patients everywhere. It's a traumatizing experience to go through and extremely painful days and nights without sleep sometimes, the bills just add to the stress causing the pain to flare more from being unrelaxed.

I'm a newspaper/magazine writer and have been writing freelance until my work dried up sometime in mid-September. Since then I haven't been able to make $500.

I have just been offered a great job working for a daily newspaper about 150 miles away and am hoping to be able to take it next week. The problem is that since my savings is gone I need the money to make the move and live until I can get back on my feet with a paycheck. I'm not talking about thousands of dollars, I think I can make it with about $500, but even then it'll be tight.

The employees of the paper have been great and have found me a place to lay my head until I can get some money coming in but I need the money for the deposit and rent. I'm also going to have to get another cell phone since mine doesn't work in the area I'm moving. It's little stuff like gas, rent and food that I'm worried about.

I'm just trying to survive until I can get a paycheck.

I'm not trying to get rich here, but I've witnessed and helped out with some of the great things the reddit community has done in the past and am hoping that you guys can find it in your heart to give me the opportunity to get back on my feet. Whether it's $1, $5 or $100 - anything will help.

I'm not used to begging like this, but am afraid that I'm not going to be able to take the job if I can't afford to move!

A good friend of mine draws the webcomic 'Goblins.' It's a great comic about a bunch of Goblins that get sick of being the lowest monsters on the AD&amp;D totem pole and decide to become adventurers. It pokes fun at fantasy, AD&amp;D, and everything else in between. He's been drawing it for a few years, and it is really a labor of love for the guy. He gets a good number of hits to his site (40k/day) but the guy thinks that it's impolite at best and absolutely abhorrent at worst to ask his fans to donate to him.

He pays for the comic by creating a sub-comic called 'Tempts Fate' that works on the premise of putting a character in dangerous situations that will only be completed if certain economic goals are met (eg - The windmill of swords will kill Tempts if the 1500$ goal is not reached). The guy is supporting his family on the comic, but has himself in a bind. He can't get another job/ let the comic drop because of how much it does bring in, but he is currently in an unsustainable model (He draws on a live feed for about 12-16 hours a day).

Do you guys have any advice for what could help him get out of this situation? Real solutions and out of the box thinking would be really great here.

I'm a nerd who loves teaching. Over the years, I've played around with many different technologies, and learned a lot in the process. While most of my experience is in the field of web design and development, I still know enough about a lot of other topics to teach beginners. For more info and my ""portfolio"", check out my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net).

**What I offer:**

One on one classes over Skype that will provide you with strong fundamentals in any of the topics I offer, and get you to a point where you can just google anything else you wish to learn, and be able to understand the tutorials easily. The software/technologies I can teach you are:

* Graphics: Photoshop, Illustrator
* Web design: HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Programming: PHP/MySQL, C, C++, Java. 

For C, C++ and Java, I will be covering the basic concepts of programming which apply to all languages, and will not focus too heavily on language specific features. If you wish to focus on a specific aspect i.e game development, mobile app development, etc, you're on your own.

**Requirements:** 

* You have to *want* to **learn**. This means you have to understand and accept that people spend their entire lives trying to master these technologies, and it will require effort on your part (usually in the form of practice) to achieve any level of competence. It will also require mental effort, and the determination to actually stick with the classes. Out of the 100+ people I've added so far, around 50 of them never even had a *single class*. A couple dozen never even confirmed the Skype contact add request. Do not be one of these people.
* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), a microphone, and a decent internet connection. Time zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle East ), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out. I've taught many people in the US so far, ranging from the east coast to the west, and it's not been an issue.
* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a Bachelor's in English Literature, but teaching, ESPECIALLY when it's computer related, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

I'm trying to help them save their struggling sheet metal services business",Non_Contributing_0,56,8,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/r8fja/request_my_friend_just_lost_half_his_leg_in_a_car/,"Thankfully my friend and his father were fortunate enough to keep their lives, but they are both in the hospital after serious injuries. My friend, BK, lost half of his leg, broke his arm and has a laceration on his neck (23 staples needed). This happened 2 weeks after his Dad's aneurysm, which he witnessed first hand. To give you an idea of what type of person he is, one of the first things he said to me on the phone yesterday was, ""I feel like a failure, I let my family down"". I told him he has no right to beat himself up over it, but he always puts others before himself and is one of the most generous people I know. The reason why he said that is because he has been running his Dad's sheet metal services business in Hudson, NH, while his dad has been in the hospital due to the aneurysm. His Dad is the hardest working man I've ever met and an incredibly caring.. just a genuinely nice person. Their business has been struggling to stay afloat since the recession hit, so BK (my friend) has been working 14+ hour days, 6-7 days a week to help run the business.

I want to help them save the business because my biggest concern is that between them they are going to be hit hard financially from medical bills while they both recover and they have no one capable of running it during their hospital stay. I have no idea how much rehabilitation and a prosthetic leg cost, but I can only imagine it is very expensive. They have no other income to my knowledge. Is there a way I can set up something that can help them financially? The last thing I want to see is them leave the hospital and have to file for bankruptcy - they do not deserve to go through that too.

I've seen Reddit accomplish incredible feats, so it was the first place I thought to turn to. I'm going to visit him later today and would love to surprise him with something to lift his spirits. I appreciate any help, thank you.

**Here is the news article about the accident:** http://www.nashuatelegraph.com/news/953853-196/truck-versus-utility-pole-at-rush-hour.html 

**Here is their business website:** http://www.asmsinc.com/

**Here is the business fanpage (you can see BK is the page owner):** https://www.facebook.com/AdvancedSheetMetalServices

I can also take a picture with him for verification when I go to visit him at Mass General Hospital later, if you request it.

**TL;DR - My friend just lost half his leg in a car accident 2 weeks after his father had an aneurysm. He was running his dad's struggling sheet metal services business while he's been in the hospital, but now he physically cannot. I'm trying to help them keep the business.

Should you live on the shores of Lake Superior, we might even be able to meet personally.

Think about how many people you can impress and how your resume will look once you can state that you took German lessons! Get pulled over - speak German and get out of the ticket? You could even surprise your significant other with new adventurous (erotic?) word constructs and sentences!

Hello RandomKindness,

The Mods at RandomKindness would like to reemphasize the notion of adding people you donate to [The Reddit Giver's List](http://sdorm.org/redditgivers).

This gives our members (and the members of other subreddits specializing in the act of giving) a useful way to log the donations made to users who request in our respective communities.

Just because a name ends up on this list **does not mean the people on there are abusing the system**, just that they have made a request or multiple requests.

We all value honesty and helping those less fortunate than ourselves. Unfortunately we can't help everyone and sometimes this comes down to determining who needs your help more. **That is why this list is valuable. It helps us all better determine who could use the help more and who could use it less.**

We also can't easily tell who is lying, who is scamming, and who is actually being honest.

Reporting people you donate to is one thing you can do to protect yourself and maintain a level of honesty in this subreddit.

Another thing you can do is to check the person out:

* How long has the requester been a member?
* Does he/she have comments outside of those in RK?
* Does his/her comments sound like a poor mother who can't afford presents for her children? Or, do they sound like a 30 year old man who hits the gym a lot and has misogynistic inclinations?
* Ask them **via PM** to provide further information about themselves.^1 

1.Disclaimer: *People requesting, if you feel like the information someone is requesting of you is too personal please PM us.*

**Yet, what it all comes down to at the end of the day is, 'Do you want to give this thing to the person asking?'**

You can be as skeptical or as trusting as you'd like, but at the end of the day it's your decision to finally ship that thing to that person.

In an ideal world there wouldn't be scammers and liers but this is the Internet we're talking about here. It's impossible to keep people from abusing a good system, but that doesn't mean we should be skeptical of everyone using it, right?

Anyways, take it easy guys and take it slowly. We have a great community here with great people giving a lot of great stuff.

There's always going to be a couple bad eggs, but the first line of defense against them starts with **you**.

If you'd like to send her a card you can message me and i'll provide some mailing info - of course the cards won't reach her until after her surgery, but she's going to be out of commission for a while so her head can heal (she's also going to have her head shaved in a noticeable way) so any little thing to brighten up her recovery and bald time would be awesome.
a little more info: her name is Elaine and she works as a trauma nurse, plays pool, drinks jager bombs like they're going out of style, LOVES basketball (North Carolina in particular for some reason), and seems to have a thing for German men (if any of you German redditors would like to send her a sexy message), and all in all is just a wonderful crazy lady.

i'm not asking for (nor will accept) any donations. just asking for maybe a drawing or a short video or something that i can email to her today, or a card i can give to her afterwards. she'd get a kick out of a bunch of internet strangers sending her something silly or encouraging.

I want to sell my family home desperately because our once decent neighborhood has become a dangerous ghetto over the last year. Recently, there was a home invasion/shooting and I am scared to live here with my husband and 3 small children. You see, we purchased our home nearly a decade ago and remodeled it completely but despite all this we are still under water in our mortgage due to the housing crisis. My 5 year old daughter wants to help us move so badly that she gave me a picture she drew and asked me to place it on EBay and would give me the money for our new house. I was so touched by her selflessness and kindness that I agreed to do it. I assumed no one would purchase it but I would pretend someone did and give her a few dollars to help with our new house fund. Well, I was very wrong! A kind and generous man from Hawaii purchased THREE of her drawings! I have never known such kindness from a stranger. It has given us hope for the future and made my daughter feel incredible. I hope to pay it forward one day when we are in a safe place.

About 6 months after he died, I adopted a 6 month old puppy from a rescue society that saves Mexican street dogs.

A week into having her, I came home from work to find the house covered in gray dust. I mean, it was EVERYWHERE. Holly (my puppy) came barrelling towards me covered head to toe in this mysterious powder. It wasn't until I walked into the living room and saw the urn on the floor and Oscar's 3/4-eaten ripped open bag of ashes lying in the dog bed that it dawned on me what happened.

At first I was shocked, but then all I could do was just laugh. Life is so funny that way. I'd like to think that my cannibal dog had her heart in the right place. We're all just dust in the wind! (or in this case, a paste of stomach acid and ashes being digested in a puppy's stomach). Sigh.

I know there are so many amazing and talented artists out there, and if any of you could help make me a piece of artwork to remember my Oscar, that would mean so much to me. I have little of what's left of him in a new urn, but I'd love to have something I could see on my wall to make me smile.

I don't have a lot of money to spare, but I would be happy to contribute anything I could to make this happen.

Here's an album of what Oscar looked like:

BUT im back! and im still offering it for someone in need! below i have copied my original post for a little backstory and what not.  
  
this is not a joke, but there is a catch

first off id like to say that i am doing this because i had a cousin who was born with only one functioning kidney and it was deformed. he wasnt suppose to live past the age of eight, but against all odds he made it to the age of 22. sadly he died because he couldnt find a donor in time..

his time was to soon, and no one deserves to die because of the fact that organs just arent that readily available.

i got the idea to do this after seeing a reddit post about someone whos kidneys had a horrible condition and i asked if i could be of help but he declined.

OKAY on to the catches.. i am broke, you would need to find me a way to get to you, other than that the only other catch is we need compatible blood types (obviously) pm me if you are interested and want to keep this confidential

Hi,

St. Pius High School administration is refusing to recognize Damian's gender identity, even though all his classmates, teachers, and family know Damian as a male. The administration says that because he has ""female"" marked on his birth certificate -- despite the fact that he is now legally Damian and not Brandi -- he still must walk in a girl's cap and gown for graduation. 

That's why I signed a petition to Barbara Rothweiler, Ph.D.  Principal, Principal, https://www.saintpiusx.com/, which says:

We will be having a small give away to celebarate this holiday. Please feel free to give anything whether it be Halloween related or not.

**Time &amp; Date**

* Wednesday, October 31 (Halloween) @ 2:00pm Eastern Time (time subject to change)

* **Please comment below expressing interest or concern to celebrate the Halloween Give Away**

**How to sign up to OFFER:**

* You can start signing up starting today until the day before the give away (Oct. 30)
* Send me (SirLlama) a **[Private Message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=SirLlama)** if you would like to Offer
* Mention 'Gift-away' in the Title
* Say what you would be willing to OFFER
* **Multiple Offers:** If you sign up to OFFER, you can have as many offers as you would like.
* Upon receiving your PM, I will add your name to this thread, but not mention your gift.

**How to claim a gift:**

* On the day of Halloween, I will create a new thread listing all the OFFERS under each giver's name

* The giver's name will be hyperlinked. Upon clicking said name, you will go straight to Private Message and can then request the item from that giver.

* **Multiple Requests:** I can not enforce 'first-come-first-served' so I will leave it up to the giver to decide who they want to give their OFFER to (normal RK Offering procedure).

**Giver Instructions:**

* To avoid as much confusion as possible I ask that each Giver both **a)** Confirms with the recipient that they will get said gift and **b)** PM me back saying that your Offer has been taken **and who has taken it**. This will allow me to 'strike-through' the offer. Thus minimizing the amount of duplicate requests you get for the already fulfilled gift. While also allowing me to keep track of who has received gifts.

* **Sending Gifts:** **DO NOT** send gifts immediately. The way the contest is currently built, it allows members to request multiple gifts, very easily. We do not want 2 members walking away with every gift.

* **Fair warning to Givers:** Please check out the person you plan on giving to. Please be wary of members with 1 Link 0 Comment karma made on accounts between now and the date of the Gift-Away (0-3 days). Check their comment histories to see if they're active in RandomKindness. Or if they applied for RK Flair.


**Gift-away Rules:**

* **Only one gift per person:** This gift-away will function on the honor system. However, every giver will report to me the names of those who they gave their gift to. If I find out that a member has been given more than one gift, it is grounds for a ban and I will instruct the giver to offer it up to someone else.

* **If you receive two gifts on accident:** If you make multiple requests and realize you have been given two gifts, immediately PM the giver and ask that they chose someone else. **YOU DO NOT WANT TO BE REPORTED FOR SCAMMING**

* **Scamming:** Seriously, don't do it. Many of our sister subreddits share a ban list together. In addition to a RandomKindness ban you can bet that all other 'helping subreddits' will refuse to help you.

Well I think that's everything! Please help by upvoting this post, for which i receive no karma, and sign up today!

I was going to donate it to kars for kids but after reading about them, I'm more inclined to give it to an individual directly. The car was recently hit back left corner in bumper to bumper traffic and needs a bit of body work. The brakes also need to be replaced. The engine/transmission or absolutely perfect and it runs very well (besides brakes squeeking)
Other known issues with the car: Some cosmetic body damage on both doors (one has paint scrapes, other has a dent from a hummer backing into the door in a parking lot) passenger seat braket is broken so the seat does not move forward or back.
This car was driven 30 miles each way to work and was in good running order until this most recent accident. It's going to need some body work/brake work to get back to road ready.
I thought someone could put it to good use, whether it be reparing the body stuff or using it for parts for other repairs, I would just hate for the car to go to waste.
My perfect candidates: Poor confused high school senior trying to find his/her place in the world and not having the cash to buy a car. An Albanian wrestler who loves fiddling with cars on his/her own. A family of cat lovers.

1334490874.0,43,self.RandomKindness,sap2t,"Request: IAMA something year old mother of four  in Los Angeles, CA with no job and an abusive husband--can't  him leave without a job and therapist is threatening CPS if I don't..",GothamDweller,52,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/sap2t/request_iama_something_year_old_mother_of_four_in/,"I need a decent paying job in the LA area. 

I have been with my husband for 16 years. He is 34 I am 38. Even though I have a BA and some post grad work completed I stay at home with the kids and he works as a waiter in a nice restaurant (was in construction but then the recession).

 He has complete control of the finances--and there is never any money for the bills or food or the kids and I have borrow everything I can from my family to make up for it. On top of this, my mother died 6 months ago and she was the only person who would take me in or help me. Now I have no one. 

He has had a history of criminal behavior and violence and emotional abuse toward me but only one isolated incident of physical violence in 2000 associated with alcohol and drugs.  Since then he has had anger management issues and has been emotionally abusive but seemed to have some control while he was clean and sober. He worked on his career and was a good father and was in therapy and growing into a better person. There was always growth even when it wasn't perfect.

About a year ago, coinciding with my mother becoming ill,  he started using opiates, and other sundry pills. This rolled into alcohol, and finally cocaine. I threatened to leave. I went to a DV shelter for help in November. I the last three months he has started getting physical--spitting at me, grabbing me, twisting my arms, leaving bruises but never punching me.   They gave me therapy (group and individual) but nothing else since its not extremely physical and the waiting list for a shelter is 6 months for a family my size. He went to rehab in January after a psychotic reaction to the cocaine (he thought people were after him.). Things got better. We got a great counselor that gave him tools to work with his problems. He goes to AA. He seems committed to the process. I let my guard down and felt like things would be OK. He relapsed again the night before Easter and grabbed me by my shirt and threw me into the TV at three in the morning in front of our son. So it started up again. 

I called the counselor and told him what happened. He threatened to call CPS if I don't leave him now. I have no resources. None. I have no bank accounts. He keeps my ATM card. The cars are in his name. I don't have a key to the front door of the apartment, even. He keeps them so I can't lock him out. 

I want to comply with the counselor. I will not allow him to lose our kids with his assfuckery. Unfortunately, I have no resources. I have no one to help me. I have no one to talk to about the escalation of the violence because of the threat from the counselor. I am terrified, and beat down and depressed. I can't even begin to think of were to start.

I need a job, first. I need a way to feed the kids if i get a protection order or leave. I am opening an account at the local CU on Monday in my son's name so he won't know. I am collecting the documents and trying to figure out where to hide them. My credit is shot so I don't know how I will qualify for an apartment but I do know I need a job. Its the first step. 

My degree is in English. My MA is ABT. I have an emergency teacher's credential. I have worked as a technical writer, a proofreader, data entry, copy editor, typesetter (all one job), marketing rep. for a book seller and taught high school (there are no jobs for me with my degree). I have good front office skills, data entry, bookkeeping, and DB management. I can even do a little IT, but I am self-taught. God, I'll clean toilets or cuddle corpses. I just need an income. I will work hard and do just about anything. 

I hope this was the right place to post. Sorry for the wall. I have another account but am using this one because it has identifying info and don't need anyone else calling CPS, too. 

TL;DR  Woman married 16 years with college degree and skills but out of work force for a while in desperate need of job after husband picked up a  drug habit,began abusing her, and her therapist threatened to call CPS and have her kids taken if she doesn't leave him STAT even though she has no access to money or help from family or friends.

EDIT::::Thank you for all the love. And the advice. I am on a mission. I will post here if you guys want to know what happens next. I have a resume in progress and will be PMing some people with it.

I have experience in many sub-fields of the vast *thing* known as ""IT"", but I am particularly experienced with the items mentioned in the title. 

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development, and have never programmed before.

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, but the ones I'm most familiar with are Java, C++, C# and (for web) PHP/Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway. Please don't contact me if you want to learn a significant amount of any language other than PHP. I consider myself qualified to help you with the basics, but I don't use those languages enough to be an ""expert"" programmer.

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad episode of depression about 2 years back and deleted/destroyed all my digital art + backups, but some of my recent stuff can be seen [here](http://elasticlogic.deviantart.com). I may not be the best artist/designer around, but if you're a photographer who wants to learn how to do some post-processing to improve their work or someone who wants to learn the basic tools in Photoshop,then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), a microphone, and a decent internet connection. Time zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle East ), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out. I've taught over 20 people in the US so far, ranging from the east coast to the west, and it's not been an issue.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, but teaching, ESPECIALLY when it's computer related, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, for every hour that i teach you, you spend an hour practicing on your own, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: I have 50+ ""students"" on my contact list, over 15 of whom have never even bothered messaging me after the initial add (5-6 never even confirmed the add request). Another couple dozen disappeared after the first class, and I don't think it's because of my teaching, because I've had unanimously positive reviews so far. Some people have given me reasons for why they're busy at the moment and can't take classes, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but please don't just add me on a whim. Good design/programming takes mental effort, and the least you can do in exchange for free classes is to be committed to learning.

**If you're interested, post here for the record, and send me a PM with your Skype ID and a rough idea of what you want to learn. I shall add you asap and we can discuss timings and what not then**.

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you!

I'm a reddit noob, but I figured I would try to get in on giving stuff away that I don't need.

The situation is that I bought Skyrim on the launch date and I really don't have time to play it with going to school and working like a mad man.  Playing games have only served to distract me from what needs to be done.  I made a new steam account when I bought Skyrim last week, so I can't ""gift"" the game to anyone.  I can only give you my username and password for it to play from that account.  You can change the email address on the account to your own, I won't be using the account again.

No need to explain why you need it.  Its a game, no one really ""needs"" it.   I'll randomly select someone tomorrow around 6pm that have replied to this thread.  Please make sure your computer can run Skyrim before replying.

Sorry in advance for those who don't get it.  I wish I had the cash to get everyone a copy.  I'm a 33 year old student with lots of bills, so I probably shouldn't have bought the game for myself in the first place. lol

I have experience in many sub-fields of the vast *thing* known as ""IT"", but I am particularly experienced with the items mentioned in the title. 

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development, and have never programmed before.

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, but the ones I'm most familiar with are Java, C++, C# and (for web) PHP/Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway. Please don't contact me if you want to learn a significant amount of any language other than PHP. I consider myself qualified to help you with the basics, but I don't use those languages enough to be an ""expert"" programmer.

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad episode of depression about 2 years back and deleted/destroyed all my digital art + backups, but some of my recent stuff can be seen [here](http://elasticlogic.deviantart.com). I may not be the best artist/designer around, but if you're a photographer who wants to learn how to do some post-processing to improve their work or someone who wants to learn the basic tools in Photoshop,then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), a microphone, and a decent internet connection. Time zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle East ), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, but teaching, ESPECIALLY when it's computer related, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, for every hour that i teach you, you spend an hour practicing on your own, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

**If you're interested, post here for the record, and send me a PM with your Skype ID and a rough idea of what you want to learn. I shall add you asap and we can discuss timings and what not then**.

I used to be actively involved in /r/playitforward but I decided to open up my giving to all of reddit.  Please read on, or skip to the end for the good part.

----

First, a little back story for the people who like that sort of stuff:

1. My story began back in September 2011 when I acquired 300 DX:HR steam keys that I [tried to trade](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/lh3xs/h_deus_ex_human_revolution_300_copies_steam_w_any/) over in gameswap.
2. Things went south really fast when [my plan backfired](http://www.reddit.com/r/gameswap/comments/ln84v/h_an_apology_w_your_forgiveness_understanding_and/).
3. Eventually after everything died down, I wanted to reciprocate for the kindness, support and assistance of the people who showed me that the goodness of people usually outweighs the few bad apples.  To that end I held [this event](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/comments/o0jav/pif_possibly_the_biggest_steam_giveaway_contest/).
4. Over the next year, I held 20 or so different events in this subreddit. Relying on [trades](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/wpq1p/h_94_different_games_w_offers/) and capitalizing on [steam coupons](http://www.reddit.com/r/SteamGameSwap/comments/ole6h/1100_coupons_something_for_everyone_collecting/) for financing, and throwing in a few hundred bucks whenever the stock got too low.  Overall I estimate the group has given out 400-450 game thus far.  Just see my submitted threads to see all the different events our group has had just in PIF

------------


So why the spread to all of reddit?

The biggest problem I had in all of this was vetting everyone.  Who should get games, who should not.  Who is cheating the system?  Who is undeserving? Also, due to the size and complexity of some of these events and the planning involved, I found that following proper /r/playitforward procedure was getting to be too much of a chore.

Now, I feel that more than anything I am in this for the fun and therefore I think it would be fun to just give away things.  No strings (or at least fewer strings) attached all over reddit. 

------

First, I would like to let people know that this giveaway, and all my giveaways are not a one time only affair, I do these 'events' several times before moving on to my next idea.  Rest assured, unless you are living under a rock, you will NOT miss it! 

Here is what happens in this giveaway:

* Join my [steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/redditgiveaway/)
* Enter chat room **whenever there is an announcement** that indicates the game is starting (This will happen many times over the course of a few months).  It will be at a random time to give everyone a chance at participating. (The announcement should pop up in your steam so you will not miss it if you are online and have joined the group)
* Once you are in group chat, you will be put in a queue or will be given instructions on how to enter a queue
* When it is your turn, you may pick a difficulty level (harder difficulty = better prizes) from which you will be randomly assigned a text adventure.  Make it to the end, and you win.
* Depending on your behavior, participation whilst waiting for your turn, demeanor, respect towards fellow players, and difficulty of the adventure chosen, you will get a list of games from which you may choose one.
* The longer this event goes on, the more likely it is that these adventures will get recycled.  You may see the same adventure more than once but be careful, there might have been minor changes!!

------------------

**Special Notes**

* Please read the steam group rules, over on the group page (mostly basic and expected stuff) and also the procedure for claiming prizes (also on the steam group)
* The prize list will constantly be modified as trades are made to increase the amount of games I have
* I have RL matters to attend to so the contest may abruptly end at any time.  Although I will try to keep it going for hour long increments.  Thanks for your understanding!
* Last and probably most important, it is **NOT** your right to participate in this giveaway.  Please do not have a sense of entitlement or complain and ruin it for others.  If you have legitimate concerns, please bring them up with me privately, and try to have **FUN**

--------------------------
As it is extremely time consuming for me to come up with these text adventures, I would appreciate any help that you guys might have to offer in coming up with ideas or helping me write some adventures.

I am trying to start a hobby. I spend all my time at home now that I am out of the Army (disabled) and don't really have a lot of friends around here. There is a local card shop down the road that holds magic tournaments. I went and played last weekend and had a great time.

Friday morning they plan to have a group on foot climb the ridge to the 5,800m mark but it may be too dangerous since the ridge does have a section of very broken glacier.

They desperately need to do a flyover of the area ASAP, but haven't been able to find a plane, despite major efforts to do so. If you know anyone in Peru who could lend or rent a plane, please contact Liora [number removed]; lioradanan@[removed]

**Location:** Fairfax, VA

Almost 6 years ago I lost my younger brother to a car crash. During the time afterwards I spent a lot of time buying things, my urges as a collector went a bit amok. As a result I find myself now with a large amount of unopened toys, primarily Star Wars and some other miscellaneous stuff.

I'm looking to find a couple kids who otherwise wouldn't get a real [*insert personal seasonal holiday here*]. My plan is to ship the items to the parents and let them wrap the gifts for the kids ""From Santa"" or whoever your choice of benevolent gift giver may be, then give them to your kids at the appropriate time.

I'll be picking a couple families with a goal to start mailing items right before Thanksgiving (US). Please be ready to provide verification if selected. What I would like is the follow:

* **Your situation:** Just a quick brief idea. 
* **Are you okay with opened items?** I have some action figures and toys that were opened and displayed, they're brand new and have all parts but I may not have the box.
* **Preferences:** Are there items you do not want your child having, IE fake weapons (light sabers), no military items (may have some GI Joes), etc. I don't want to send you something you disapprove of.
* **Child Gender:** Gender will have no bearing on the gifts, I'm a girl and loved Star Wars and GI Joe, but I think I have a couple things that are more gender oriented, like a Amidala/Leia dress up items. If you have a girl, or even a boy that likes those sorts of things let me know.
* **Age:** I don't need the exact age just an idea. I don't want to send toys for kids 10+ to a toddler, I do have some items that are appropriate for younger children like some Playskool hero packs. Feel free to use the standard toy age ranges. 
* **Pet Allergies?** These items are currently being stored in an extra room in our apartment. We have two cats, if you are allergic or your children are this could be an issue

For those curious about why I'd want to do this its pretty straight forward. I've had periods in my life where money was short, growing up especially when I was younger there were a few times that Christmas was made possible through the random kindness of others. Its my way of paying forward the kindness I received from others.

I only ask that others pay forward any kindness I offer them.

**Edit:** Proof that I have the toys, here are some images of the bins and whats inside some of them. I'll have to wait till tomorrow to monkey into the buried ones if people really want to see. 

Imgur Gallery - http://imgur.com/a/z2Rgi 

For those suggesting or wondering why I'm not just using a well known charity I'm doing this for the reddit community. I've been here 10 months and its my way to give back a bit to those who might need it. I'm also very picky about the charities I volunteer with or donate to and stick with only those that give the vast majority of their raised funds (90%+) to their programs. I happily support Toys for Tots and Child's Play and local Boys and Girl's Clubs.

**Edit2:** Wow this really picked up today! I've got requests in from 6 people, five in thread and 1 in a PM. I'm in crunch time right now for a end of the day item at work, but I'll try to get replies to the last couple people shortly with any additional info I need and PMing people chosen with verification requests. I'll be choosing people periodically until probably a week before Thanksgiving.

Earlier this year, when I had some free time, I gave a few people free classes, and now I've returned to do it again. 

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development, and have never programmed before.

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, but the ones I'm most familiar with are Java, C++, C# and (for web) PHP and Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you, as the basic concepts of programming are more or less the same across the commonly used programming languages. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway. 

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad period of depression about 3 years back and deleted/destroyed nearly all of my digital art, but some of my recent stuff can be seen on my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net/#design). I may not be the best artist/designer around, but if you're a photographer who wants to learn how to do some post-processing to improve their work or someone who wants to learn the basic tools in Photoshop/Illustrator, then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), a microphone, and a decent internet connection. You do NOT need to have a webcam. I use the screen sharing feature of Skype to view your screen as you go through the lessons.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, but teaching, ESPECIALLY when it's computer related, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, for every hour that i teach you, you spend an hour practicing on your own, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: In the first round of classes, I added over 120 people to my contact list, and less than 30 of them actually had a class. Most of the rest never even responded to the add request, or just never came online. Some students told me when they were busy and could't take classes, and I'm perfectly okay with that, but please don't just add me on a whim. Good design/programming takes mental effort, and the least you can do in exchange for free classes is to be committed to learning.

**If you're interested, post here for the record, and send me a PM with your Skype ID and a rough idea of what you want to learn. I shall add you asap and we can discuss timings and what not then**.

You can find out a bit more about me from my [website](http://www.rohitnair.net)

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you! I have people spread across a bunch of different time zones, and most of them are busy with work too, so until I get a few dozen students, you're sure to get a slot.

I have taken approximately 6 years of community college, though due to purposeful misguidance from my mother, I haven't taken the right classes to have a degree. So I know a lot about a lot of random things. I don't care if I get a legit job or get paid under the table, but if you are going to pay me under the table, I will only accept getting paid in cash. 

Just give me an interview and I will be able to prove my worth to you. I'd be happy to talk in detail about any job opening you have, and I'd be happy to show you why you want to hire me.

You dont need to overcome.
You just have to continue to be you.
You are already built differently than overcommers.
Thats perfectly ok. As a matter of fact it is correct!
I know I know you feel different and gullible, it doesn't matter.
Your joy comes from the ability to recognize why you are here and it wants to pour out of you. Let it. Thats what makes you feel good.
As it should. People pay crazy amounts of money to feel this joy.
And guess what, they never have what you have.
Dont worry about the overcomers.
Just be yourselves and enjoy the peace that comes from being you.

He caught onto it really quick and has become a good artist. He's been looking to get into a tattoo apprenticeship. I had been saving up to get him a tattoo set, but due to some hardships recently, it wasn't going to happen. I posted here about a week ago to see if anyone might have an old tattoo gun they didn't use anymore &amp; could part with. Halopolice swooped in for the rescue. He bought my husband a 6-gun tattoo kit. It has 6 awesome guns, a ton of needles, two practice skins, 40 inks, power supply and loads more along with a very nice case that locks to store everything in. It came in the mail today and the hubby was quite surprise. At the end of this post is the link for the gallery of images I took of the kit, and a video of him opening it. :) 

I want to give halopolice the biggest thank you ever! My hubby will finally get to see his dreams come true. This is the most amazing thing ever. Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU!

I have a lot of things going on this time of year. My husbands birthday is in the beginning of Nov and my birthday is in beginning of Dec. One thing I would love for my husband and my son to see is Disneyland during the holidays.  We attempted to go a couple of years ago, but made the stupid stupid mistake of buying tickets off craigslist and we got to the gate and found out they were purchased with a stolen credit card and were not valid. Disneyland took no sympathy in me and my family and we never got to go. Spent most of our funds just on those tickets. The last time I went in was when I was younger with my family and it was MAGICAL. My husband and son have never had the privelege. 

I really wish we could afford everything but I really cant do it all right now. I do work as much as I can but with bills and all the prescriptions I have to take for my Fibro, it makes it nearly impossible for me to provide a special, magical time for my family. I have a hotel credit, so I can use that for our night stay and I know I am able to bring sandwiches, drinks and stuff so we don't spend money on that. 

I'm thinking maybe there is a redditor out there that works at Disneyland (I heard they get free passes?) or someone that knows of a way to get some tickets, this would be wonderful... I need this.

**Rules and FAQ**

To enter, simply comment below which games you want. You are allowed to ask for multiple or all games, but keep it to one post. Please don't ask for a game you already own, and please check the store pages of the games to see if your system can handle the game. When the giveaway end time rolls around, I'm going to use Random.org to pick a winner from the list of comments. Winners will have a Reddit PM sent to them asking for some info so I can send you your game.

**I won X in a previous giveaway and I don't have it yet!** Please PM me. I've finally gotten around to writing down all the winners in one document, and I've come to realize that there a few games in previous giveaways that the previous owners haven't claimed. I'm not sure if it is because people have sent me wrong e-mails and stuff, but it's hard for me to track down, so be sure to find me first!

**Why don't you post your giveaways on other gaming related giveaway subreddits?** Tradition mostly. I started this thing last year here on /r/RandomKindness and I really don't want to bring it somewhere else. I know I'm probably making things worse for the people who are getting annoyed with game requests, so please feel free to send me a message or comment below if you want to discuss it or if you have a good idea.

Anyways, be sure to **upvote** so more people can see (**it's a self post so I don't get karma for it**) and you're also free to **[join my Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamgamegiveawayweekend)** because I post announcements when the giveaways go live so you don't miss anything!

So I posted this is in [1] /r/RAMD and they are awesome I was just hoping to inundate her with mothers day cards. Below is my original post. I will message you her address when requested. Thanks Reddit
My mom is the greatest as I am sure most of yours are. She has been a rock my whole life especially when my father was diagnosed and died all within a month and a half. She works full time and serves voluntarily on boards in the area as well as does outreach for low-income families helping them with legal issues. She is the strongest woman I know. She has been through so much this past couple of months from her husband dying to her brother passing away 10 days ago. She deserves so much and I am asking anyone who would like to send her a mothers day card. I would love her to just start asking where on earth cards are coming from and be excited hearing kind words from random people out there in the world. Also if you want she loves Almond Roca candy if you want to put a little something with the card. I just want to make sure her first mothers day without her husband is one to help her heal. Thank you fellow Redditors I truly hope this happens for her.

edit: Spelling, list of ideas

So I have been asked more then once to give more ideas on what she likes. Here are some off the top of my head

She enjoys flowers, candy for the most part, I said Almond Roca because my dad would always get the Costco size almond Roca for her. 
She also loves gardening, sewing and Elvis Presley. 

mistegrl also let me know about this link for two card companies that are providiing free cards for mothers day. Makes this even easier. Thanks

Please help.",bathori,44,8,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/pgkc6/charitylos_angeles_this_is_widget_shes_3lbs/,"Hi Reddit! I volunteer as a foster for an LA based dog rescue called [Dogs without Borders](http://www.dogswithoutborders.org/). 

2 days ago I got an email asking if anyone could foster a tiny, 3lbs chihuahua puppy for a few days. She was still in the shelter but they didn't want to pull her unless she had somewhere to go. She was an owner surrender for ""being too much work"". She's about 8 months old.

I picked her up yesterday morning. She's very small, she has a little kennel cough, she's in heat (!), she has fleas and she was not putting ay pressure on her back left leg.

The X-ray shows that she has a broken hip. It's likely that someone stepped on her and didn't want to pay the vet bills to fix her so they dumped her at the shelter. Sadly, in LA, this disposable attitude is really common. 

She needs surgery. She's in constant pain. Making a poop for her must be excruciating as it puts pressure on her hips. She cries whenever she's awake. We have her on pain meds but really, she needs this fixed as soon as possible.

If you have $1 you can donate to [Dogs without Borders](http://www.dogswithoutborders.org/) for Widget it would mean the world.

Thank you. 

**TL;DR - Chihuahua puppy rescued from shelter has broken hip. Needs $$ for surgery. Plz help.**

[Widget - for size](http://i.imgur.com/GW9zA)

ps. I know cash requests are uncouth but there's not really another way to pay for the surgery. :(

ETA: [Here's a photo of her x-ray. Notice the unsightly gap between her hip bones at the top? Yeah :S](http://i.imgur.com/ZINSc)

**UPDATE Feb 11/12: The surgeon re-assessed her x-ray and then did some tests on Widget and no longer thinks she has nerve damage so she might not need surgery after all. She's on new pain killers as well as antibiotics to deal with her worsening kennel cough. Regardless of the outcome we received full sponsorship for her treatment from a supporter of the rescue! THANK YOU to everyone for your thoughts, comments and donations! I will update when I have more news. **

I have experience in many sub-fields of the vast *thing* known as ""IT"", but I am particularly experienced with the items mentioned in the title. 

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development, and have never programmed before.

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, but the ones I'm most familiar with are Java, C++, C# and (for web) PHP/Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway.

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad episode of depression about 2 years back and deleted/destroyed all my digital art + backups, but some of my recent stuff can be seen [here](http://elasticlogic.deviantart.com). I may not be the best artist/designer around, but if you're a photographer who wants to learn how to do some post-processing to improve their work or someone who wants to learn the basic tools in Photoshop,then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), a microphone, and a decent internet connection. Time zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle East ), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, but teaching, ESPECIALLY when it's computer related, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, for every hour that i teach you, you spend an hour practicing on your own, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

**If you're interested, post here for the record, and send me a PM with your Skype ID and a rough idea of what you want to learn. I shall add you asap and we can discuss timings and what not then**. I've had about 4-5 people message me at the time of this edit, and obviously there's a limit on how many people I can teach, but I can teach some people what they're asking for in as little as 1-2 hours, so you'll get your knowledge soon enough.

Alright, so.. I'm a minor. I live at home with my mom, and my little brother. I'd say that we're lower middle class, we aren't exactly poor, but we've always struggled financially because a single mom that works at Kroger can only do so much by herself. A few weeks ago, my mom was diagnosed with [Trigeminal Neuralgia](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigeminal_neuralgia), nicknamed The Suicide Disease, because people say you would rather kill yourself than deal with the pain. Sometimes 5 or 6 times a day for varying amounts of time, my mom would deal with excruciatingly horrible pain in her face to an unbearable extent. And the worst thing is, there's nothing you can really do about it. Pain killers don't work because it's a disease with her nerves and pain killers don't do anything for her. She also has fibro mialga (spellcheck?) But she can't take her medicine for that, because it makes her face flare up and hurt worse. She's one of the most amazing people I know, and she's dealing with some of the worst pain any human being can experience on this earth (Quote from the neurologist she saw yesterday).   
  
  
  
The difficult part is that her bosses were giving her a very hard time about not always being able to come into work when she was in pain, so she got a letter from her doctor basically saying that they need to back off and she can't always work. Because Kroger has the worker's union, they can't fire her, but they did the next best thing. They put her on indefinite medical leave until she's 100% cured of a disease she'll have for the rest of her life. Her already relatively low pay is now cut in half and she has to do manual labor and odd jobs to be able to pay for bills, while in extreme pain most of the time. We already struggled enough, but this is just too much for anyone to deal with alone... She's too strong to ask for help, and she stays strong for me and my brother, but I can see how much she hurts and how much help she needs. I've been selling a lot of my video game collection, and my craigslist sales is the main reason we could pay rent this month. But I can't do it all when I can't work a full time job with school coming up, and I don't know what to do or who to turn to. We have our electric on, and we paid our rent. But we haven't had hot water in the month we've lived in our new house, and internet and cable is no longer a priority since we can't afford it.  
  
  
  
  
  
**My Request**  
I can understand that many of you would be uncomfortable with sending a random teenager on the internet Paypal money just because he gave you a sad story. If you have any advice on how to verify my story please let me know and I'll do what I can. We of course need money to be able to pay the bills, pay for food, for gas, and any other living expenses. But if you want to help in other ways that would be great too! Gift cards to places where we can buy food, books that my mom can read to help her through things, VHS movies (my mom LOVES movies, that's what she spends a lot of her free time doing is watching movies on her VCR), non-perishable food or coupons to get food. Or if you don't want to donate but would like to give an encouraging word to my mom, I can give you our address and you can write her a nice letter, or draw her a picture, or something like that. Anything and everything to help would be amazing... I just want her to know she isn't alone and doesn't have to go through this by herself. Thank you so much for listening to my story, I'm sorry for attacking you with a wall of text.  
  
  
  
Edit: **Proof has been posted in the comments by OpinionatedSouthern, the pictures consist of my moms old and new meds (the one on the far right is her newest meds perscribed by the neurologist, one of the pictures has her diagnosis of Trigeminal Neuralgia, her Radiology outpatient form, her Pain Management Center form and the type of injection she received for a trigeminal nerve block. If you require more proof let me know and I'll see what I can do.** Thanks OpinionatedSouthern!

She gives from the depths of her soul and a lot of times on the quiet tip in the backgrounds. She does what she does, gives all she gives and could careless about the recognition.

Happy Holidays RK!",Avien,42,2,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/nmpd0/rk_regardless_of_what_you_believe_december_is_a/,"Ladies and Gentlemen of RandomKindness, I am not the most selfless of people. I'm skeptical, cynical at times, and can even be a bit of a Grinch.

But when I stumbled upon RandomKindness I was immediately drawn to a vibe our community gives off; which in essence is pure, unadulterated, gift giving.

Usually we reserve our wealth to give to those we care about, most often in our immediate family and circle of friends. The fact that random people would use their money to buy random gifts for random strangers is so mind boggling in this consumer driven culture. A culture that dictates that we help ourselves and help only those close to us...which if you think about it indirectly helps ourselves.

I'm not sure what the tally is for how many gifts the RK community has donated to its members and various charities, but if I had to guess I'd say we've all given a lot.

The members have and will always be the source of this community's strength. As the Mods of this community we feel it is our duty to give you the tools and information required to help you gift safely and kindly. You have the power to change one person's life. You have the power to help those who can not help themselves. And you have the power to make this community the most generous place in reddit!

However, we can't accomplish this feat if we're always bickering. We can't, if we allow bias and disbelief to override our judgement of people. We can't, if we're all focused on what we can get, rather than what we can give.

There will always be scammers and bullies, there will always be dishonesty, there will always be those who have and continue to receive. But we should not let these factors override our own desires and feelings to give to each other. No, we should recognize these flaws and use them to motivate us to give more, to help more, to hope more! So that the greatness in us does not get out-shined by trivial issues.

I have faith that this community can be THE example of the empathetic and caring nature of human kind, albeit the caring nature of reddit et. all.

So please RandomKindness, in the spirit of the Holidays and in this time of giving, make it your goal to OFFER more and fulfill REQUESTS. Not only that, but be thankful for what we have in these uncertain times. Not just material things, but for family and friends and this community. I know we can't help everyone, but that doesn't mean we can't aspire to do just that.

Happy Holidays RandomKindness.

He got hot, took his coat off and ended up leaving it on there, they didn't realize it was gone until they got to the car.  My wife asked around and I made phone calls, but it is pretty much as good as gone.  My son feels really bad about the whole situation.  I won't have any money until the end of next week, and nearly all of that will be going to rent with the rest going to food.  This week we're supposed to get our first real snow and it's going to be a lot colder.

I know the reddit community is famous for helping others in need and I'm reaching out to you all now in the hopes that you will do it again!!

May is National Mobility Awareness Month. To celebrate, a national adaptive vehicle dealer association is giving away 3 wheelchair ramp vans in a contest. In order to be considered for a semi-finalist, I must receive enough votes to be in the top 5% of entrants. Please vote for me daily through this link: http://www.mobilityawarenessmonth.com/entrant/angie-plager-cambridge-ia/

You can vote once per day per IP address (computer location). For example, you could vote at work, at home, and on your mobile device each day (and often times, you can vote multiple times on your mobile devices each day). Vote every day now through May 10th. Please vote as much as you are able to get me into the semi-finals, which will then be judged by an independent panel.

After my previous vehicle was destroyed in an accident last June, a new vehicle would not only increase my independence and quality of life, but also those that I am passionate about helping. Being able to drive independently will enable me to acquire and maintain employment, as well as keep up with the volunteer roles I have. I truly and sincerely appreciate every single vote!

You will need to fill out your first &amp; last name, email address, and complete a simple math problem (as a human check). You can vote once a day from each IP address (computer location). It will take some work but, if we work together, we can get me in the top 5%. You can get an extra vote by answering a bonus question. Before you click on the blue ""vote"" button, click the box to the left that says ""want an extra vote?"". Click there, answer the bonus question correctly and your daily vote is doubled.

Each computer location can vote once a day through May 10th…please vote and please share with others (email, facebook, etc.) asking them to vote daily as well.

You can read more about me when you click on the link.

Every vote counts, so please vote daily and ask others to vote!

I don't even know where to begin. My wife and I have been teetering maddeningly on the brink of destitution for a few years, now. Every month is a mini heart attack financially, and it only ever seems to get worse. In the past few months alone:

* My wife lost her part time job, depriving us of any further streams of income aside from my own crappy, insufficient one. Three months behind on the rent now, and only just managed to get the electricity turned back on before Sandy turned it back off again. 

* Our apartment got robbed, costing us my wife's jewelry, a few hundred dollars in cash, and a priceless watch that was my only inheritance from my most beloved grandfather, who died earlier in the year.

* My car got towed twice--the first time due to unpaid parking tickets and the second because I left it parked somewhere that became a bus-only lane before I got back to it--and ran me up even further expenses that I don't have the money for. 

* My wife was bedridden for a while with her difficult second pregnancy and my daughter contracted the flu, obligating me to remain at home for several days, which has now placed my job security in stark question; I have picked up some whispers about my imminent termination.

I can go on--believe me, there's more--but I'm near tears even typing this. I don't know what to do anymore or where to turn. I'm at the end of my rope. I've posted in /r/assistance numerous times, and I just can't bother them any more. I have no relatives or friends who are well enough off to lend me or gift me with financial help, and I can feel myself spiraling into a deep depression with no seeming end in sight. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this or what it is I even expect, but all of you in this subreddit are kind, caring people, and I guess what I can use now is kindness. I don't have much else left.

Dear R/Assistance I am not sure where else to post this, but my family needs help. If there is another place to post then please please please direct me to it. I live about 30 miles outside Charleston West Virginia, and a call came in this morning that my Sister-in-laws house was on fire.

I have not seen it, as I am watching my kids while my wife went over to help her sister. We were told that there was nothing the Fire Department could do, so I have been lead to believe they have lost everything. No one was injured, but her car keys, her cell phone, all of her clothes for her and her 4 kids, as well of her little brother were in that house, and they have lost everything. I have seen Reddit band together before to help people out in a situation like this, and I am here now asking for that aid. My wife took her digital camera to take photos, so that I can post proof that I am not trying to scam you. As soon as I get my hands on the camera, I will post pics for you to see as proof.

This is developing as I type this, more new, and pics when I can get them. I wanted to try and get the ball rolling ASAP.

Edit #1: Just found out that Channel 13 news is there filming, and it started with a candle that she had lit. She walked out of the room to fix popcorn, and by the time it was done, the fire was already out of control.

Edit #2: Pics of the house taken with a phone camera. http://imgur.com/a/hz6AV

Edit #3: The Redcross had already been notified, so that ball is rolling.. Than you.

Edit #4: Kids clothes sizes are as followed.  
11 Year old boy, 14/16 clothes,   shoe size 9.  
9   year old Girl,  12/14 clothes,  shoe size 4.  
6   year old girl    8/10  clothes,  shoe size 2, 
3   year old girl,   4/5 clothes,    shoe size 10w or 11.  
This is from a Text message sent to me.  And its copied exact. 
Any aid would be great. I will try and answer what I can. 

If anyone wants to donate clothes, Contact me, and I will give my address for them to be sent to, If Anyone wants to donate money, or anything else, I have A paypal, or again I can gave my address... With out further information, I am not sure what else to say.

Edit #6: Spent a large chunk of the evening going through the remains, trying to find anything that can be salvaged,  looks like a couple of the kids video game systems and things may make it,  a couple laptops survived, but the kids lost there Kindle Fires, which they got for Christmas,  Those took the parents months of saving from the parents to get.

Hello.


I have a bit of a long story, so please bear with me.


I am twenty-one years old and have been with the same man for almost two years. We're very young, but committed to each other - and have been since the beginning. This story is about us, but this story is mainly about him.

Earlier this year, in April, we found out we were pregnant. It was a surprise - we used birth control, and didn't know what could have been wrong. We were terrified, but he was especially. I could see the fear in his eyes. I offered him the option to leave, but he didn't. He stayed, for me and for us, and things were great for a while. We got excited, we discussed names, we bought books at thrift stores because we wanted our baby to be able to read before all of the other kids in his or her class.

At our five month ultrasound, we discovered that this wouldn't be the case. We were having a girl, but her heart was too big. Way too big. The doctor told us that it was only a matter of time until her heart gave out - there was no hope. A dying baby was growing inside of me. The months between this discovery and her passing were dark - for me, especially. I raged, I cried, I made a mess, I barely did anything at work. And this lovely man, my love, didn't complain. He picked up after me, held me when I cried, and kept his own emotions in check so I wouldn't have to worry about him. He was incredible.

We lost her when I was almost eight months along. It's been a little over a month since it happened. 

I took time off after it happened. I received some short term disability, but not much more than what could be used to cover rent. We're currently in the black hole between my decreased pay for time off and my regular pay - which, while isn't a ton, is enough.

I want to give him the best Christmas I possibly can this year. I tell him time and time again how much I love him, how incredible he is, and how much I appreciate his strength but he just passes it off like it's no big deal. I can afford to get him a few simple things this year, but I want to do more. As much as I can for him. I know there are people that might deserve this more than we do and if you feel we aren't in need of your help, that's fine - but I can't tell you enough how much he deserves to be shown that not only do I think he's incredible, other people do too.

So, any help - anything is great. I can tell you some of his interests, too. He enjoys cooking and grilling - he's actually quite great, a big fan of asian cuisine and manly meat craft. He loves comic books, especially Batman and IDC - he's into Preacher right now but I'm not sure how far he is into the series. He likes most nerdy male pursuits - Doctor Who, Portal, etc. He used to be a pretty talented skateboarder before some ankle and knee injuries but he's looking to try and get into it again in the future. He enjoys dressing well - or at least, he would if we could afford it. I've seen him ogling ties and dress shirts in his desire to be ""fancy"", but he generally wears fitted jeans and clever t-shirts. No matter what, he looks great though. He likes building and creating - art, of any form - even if he's not the most talented at it. He's just.. in a nutshell.. great.

If you have any questions, requests, ideas, or anything - please PM me or comment here. Thank you so much for consideration, help, and words. :)

My friend Laura's pride and joy, Gandalf, is sick and the vet is estimating that at the end of the road they will have to pay $2000, which she does not have. He has a blocked urethra. He's at the vet right now with a catheter, which cost $500. They want to do an ultrasound, another $500, for a potential surgery that costs approximately $1000.

I want to help her as much as I can, but I don't have a lot to give. $100 at the most, if I can manage it.

The main reason why she cannot pay is that she is a Canadian living in American on a student visa. She is paying almost three times more to go to school here than she would be living at home. Because she is on a student visa, the only place she can work is on campus, for minimum wage. She uses that to pay off as much of her student loans as she can. I don't like asking for charity and if I had anything to offer, I would be selling it instead. Anything will help.

* Stay safe: do not give away personal information in posts, only give your address in PM once you are sure you want to send / receive anything
* Stay anonymous: if you have something to offer but want to make sure you stay anonymous please feel free to use a throwaway, you can PM from throwaway and request the flair on your main account instead
* Please remember to upvote good posts, more upvotes will mean encouragement to kind people and more visibility to reddit outside RK
* Please make sure you keep your offer post updated
* Request are more likely to be fulfilled for used items than new/cash
* If the person you want to do something nice for turns out to be a dick, well that sucks. Please make sure to update us all so we can be more aware for next time
* Remember it feel better to give than to receive, if you received something try to pay it forward

**Post format:**

1. Start with one of these tags

 [OFFER]

 [REQUEST] (If you have a sad story which may get you more attention please be ready to provide a proof to somebody who is willing to offer or the Mods)
 
 [CHARITY] (any general request regarding a charity)

 [RK] (anything related to community but not actually an offer or request) 

2. Add second tag with location you are willing to sent to / receive. This should be from top to bottom i.e. UK then London
e.g. [US], [JP], [US, NYC] , [FR, Paris], [US, KY], [UK, London] 

3. State the item and any conditions you might have

**Few examples:**

* [OFFER][US] A teddy bear for somebody
* [REQUEST][UK, Manchester] Help, need new keyboard
* [RK] Any new ideas for kindness?
* [OFFER][XX] A free hosting account for your personal website

**User Flair:**

**Update: it moved to : [FLAIR ALL THE THINGS!!!](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/lioy4/flair_all_the_things/)**

**Mods:**

So far we have a good number of enthusiastic people and I hope they are helpful. I am aware we have more people willing to do this. So in true RK fashion we will ask our current Mods in 2 weeks if they think they should give away modship as they can not contribute much. If somebody gives up we will have more mods.
For now it should be OK.

**Downvoting**

It is very un-kind of you to downvote somebody else's reply in an offer post. However for now we will not disable downvoting button and see how it goes. If it does not improve I will disable downvoting button in comments.


**Open Community**

My wife and I have a pair of very close friends that we did a lot for (with no expectation of anything more than a thank you) about a year ago when they were getting married.  They recently offered to pay for a nice dinner to repay us. We didn't want to accept but they said that wasn't an option. So they give us a card with a $350 Visa gift card in it and after several rounds of refusal it is clear that they will be offended if we decline.

We have been kicking around ideas and have gotten some good ones from other redditors including: 
kiva.org, kickstarter, animal shelter, Ronald McDonald House, and numerous other charities. We have also been inspired [by this recent post](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/1dj74s/bags_my_mum_hands_out_to_homeless_people_there/) to purchase supplies for care packages for the homeless in our area.

Although, initially, there were many responses, not many cards have come in.  (To those who sent something, it means more then you can imagine!!  Will be posting pics) 


My son is turning 10 next Monday and, as things have been extremely difficult financially (both my boys are special needs, insurance last year changed to a company that offers no autism or developmental delay coverage, gas is insane and I go through a lot for therapy/specialist appointments, etc) these past twoish years, we just do not have the money for gifts or much of a celebration. He receives almost nothing from family for Xmas/birthdays. We stopped having parties as no child has ever shown up for a birthday party of his (heartbreaking).  He will really enjoy receiving a bunch of birthday wishes from all over and it will make his birthday extra special even if we cannot afford much! 

Jamie is my little trooper. He is autistic and has many syndromes and deficits that sometimes go along with being on the spectrum (motor skills deficits, hypotonia, dysgraphia, executive function deficits, social skills deficits, generalized anxiety disorder, speech &amp; language deficits, Sensory Processing Disorder, etc, etc). He was just diagnosed with Tourette's this year (and it has been a pita trying to get his painful tics under control. His meds seem to have stopped working again these past two weeks...) and we just found out he may have Ankylosing Splondylitis (I was just diagnosed a few months ago. Extremely painful auto-immune disease).  He is extremely high functioning and it took years and years of an unbelievable amount of therapy and tutoring, which he has rarely ever complained about!

He's dealt with a lot of consistent bullying since kindergarten. We finally had the board of ed agree to a school transfer, so last year (and so far this year) there have been no incidents of bullying, yet none of his peers want anything to do with him or will play with him at recess (something the school considers not a big deal).  He has done (and continues to do) a ton of therapy/tutoring and seems to always be going to some specialist appointment and he very rarely complains. He doesn't complain being dragged to his baby brother's therapies and appointments either (we spend at least 4 hours just driving to therapies weekly, sometimes up to 10 hours weekly depending on if either (or both) boys have a specialist visit).  It looks like our youngest may end up with the same or similar diagnoses. 

He's just an awesome kid. He loves TF2, Skyrim and Minecraft.  TF2 is his obsession ATM (Pyro is his go to).  He's seen almost every episode of Dr Who (7/10 doctors) and every episode of Mythbusters, Soul Eater, Wolf's Rain and MLP (yes, he's a Bronie and is so embarrassed that he won't admit it to anyone).  He makes rage comics (he knows what Reddit is but doesn't browse it) and builds awesome Halo Mega Bloks toymations.  He loves to watch terrible scary B movies with me.  He also loves Skrillex and could gem mine for hours on end.  He says he will have no problem becoming a CEO of a multi-billion dollar company (apparently, dentists don't make enough).  He's a great big brother, even when the baby is annoying him (he says his brother is the best thing that has happened in his life).  He's the type of person who would take the gift bags we made for his birthday party to the kids at school/therapy/social skills play group/therapeutic horseback riding group even though not a single one of them showed up to his birthday party...

He has come so far. Back when he was diagnosed, he couldn't skip, hop, run without falling, write his name legibly (writing is still painful and tiring so he uses the school's laptop much of the time), zip, snap, button, etc. Now he's reading at a 6th grade level (he's in 4th), volunteers with the kindergarten class to help them learn to read, is trying hard to be able to tie his shoes (motor skills/executive function deficits make it extremely hard for him) and as soon as we can afford to get him a bike, he has decided he is going to work on learning to ride in physical therapy (a huge goal for him)!  

Seriously, i could go on and on about how great my Jamie is!  To say the least, I am an extremely proud mom!

Tl;dr: I have a little boy turning 10, who is kinda lonely, has worked extremely hard in life and has had a rough couple of years. He would love to receive a bunch of cards/postcards for his birthday...it will brighten his day!  He's pretty damn awesome too. (Yeah, I kind of adore him)

I'm not soliciting for a kickstarter, or anything like that. What I would love is for people to help me spread the URL to my jewelry shop on twitter, facebook, email, carrier pigeon, whatever!

My family is in a tough spot. I've got two kids with special needs (disability, chronic illness). I've been a little overzealous in the past couple years in rescuing sick and/or stray animals. To say that we're overextended is a major understatement.

I tried soliciting donations last year to help get us out of debt so that we could pursue extra therapy for our two year old with autism, and so that we might be able to travel bringing our sick 13 year old to participate in clinical studies for her refractive Crohn's Disease.

I'm happy to report that we did receive a few donations. Not enough to put a dent in our debt, but enough to help keep the heat on all winter without having to worry about also buying groceries. Thanks to some excellent local therapists, our youngest is doing very, very well and we think she'll be attending mainstream classes when she reaches kindergarten age. It's not done deal yet, but the future looks bright. Our thirteen year old is still struggling with her Crohn's, but the debilitating joint pain that was keeping her immobilized at least a few days per month has all but disappeared.

What we're left with is a mountain of bills. Medical bills. Tax bills. All sorts of financial backlog that occurs when you're flat out trying to get your kids to docs in other states, take time off of work to attend therapy consults, maintain the care and feeding of maybe a few too many rescue animals who weren't adopted and became pets, the whole 9 yards.

My wife is a nurse so she's picking up extra shifts. Me, I'm trying to start up a side business. I'm registered as an artist this year at Connecticon and I hope to kick some butt there with my dice jewelry, which you can see at http://lokisluckycharms.etsy.com

The dice stuff is doing pretty well, but my margins are really low. It's not a money maker, more like a self-sustaining hobby that's been great for my stress level this winter.

What I'm really trying to get off the ground is my copper fashion jewelry at http://suddenlyjewelry.etsy.com

Jewelry is a hyper-saturated market. It's hard to stand out against a HUGE field of artisans out there all trying to get noticed. I think I have something unique, that's not really being done out there yet, but it's hard to get eyeballs on it.

1335489094.0,32,self.RandomKindness,sujef,[RK] We're looking to hire two new Moderators for RandomKindness! Details inside.,Avien,38,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/sujef/rk_were_looking_to_hire_two_new_moderators_for/,"**Congratulations to you RandomKindess**

My, my, look how much we've grown RK! In just over 6 months since our inception, we've gained 8,600+ subscribers. That means we are the 532 most popular subreddit, or in the top 1% out of all 129,234 subreddits.

Give yourselves a well deserved pat on the back. That's no small feat for a subreddit that is practically new!

**Our Goals**

When fromITroom first created the subreddit it was his goal to develop a generous community that would not discriminate against how, why or what people wanted to give to others. It was and continues to be a place for random people to come together and help one another. 

**Looking Forward**

When I first arrived at RK there were only ~1,200 or so subscribers. The community was incredibly tight-knit and helpful. In the 5 months or so of being a Moderator I've seen that number multiply exponentially. It's exciting to see this subreddit live up to its potential and bring so many strangers together.

But such achievement is not without its share of challenges.

As more and more people join RK, the quality of the offers have dwindled, heroes of the subreddit have since faded, and bad eggs have multiplied. RK is changing a lot from what it once was as we seek to accommodate more and more people.

But change is never inherently bad. It presents us the opportunity to learn, shape, then transform RK into something better as we overcome new challenges and adversity.

**Moderator Requirements**

To help us in this task we require two new Moderators. 

If you would like to be a Mod for RandomKindness we would give preference to those that meet the following requirements:

* Have extensive knowledge of CSS.

* Is very active either on reddit or RK and is able to check mod mail, reported links, spam box multiple times per day.

* Has experience moderating other subreddits or Forums

* Has been a member of RK for &gt;3 months. Or can sympathize with our goals and bring new ideas to the table.

* Demonstrates a professional, mature attitude and has commendable verbal skills.

* Didn't skip directly to 'Moderator Requirements'. Instead he/she started reading from the top.

These requirements are by no means exclusive. Our hopes are that by setting the bar high enough we can find two people truly dedicated to RK and who genuinely desire to help the community.

Though, we are considering that one of our candidates be a strong 'Community Outreach' moderator while the other specializes in website construction and CSS/HTML.

**How to apply**

If you would like to be a Moderator send an e-mail to randomkindnessmods@gmail.com with whatever skills and/or experience you think qualifies you for the position.

Please also provide us with your main reddit account alias.

My husband's 31st birthday is coming up, and I would really like it if people would be willing to send him postcards, birthday cards, letters, or anything like that in the mail. It doesn't have to be expensive, and it doesn't even have to be personalized if you don't want it to be, he just really loves to get things in the mail and I don't really have the money to buy him anything cool this year.

My husband is a great guy, and a big nerd. He's a stay at home dad with our 2 year old daughter, and he does an amazing job. He is really into Doctor Who, Firefly/Serenity, Lego, pirates (especially Captain Jack), and he loves RPG's (including WOW and SWTOR). 

If you could find it in your heart to send him something before May 26th (which is his birthday) that would be super outstanding. 

Thanks so much, redditors!

Hey guys. My friend called the other day and she was really upset because she has reached a point in her life where she feels like the road to her dream is coming to an end. She's been fighting through the BS of trying to make a living in the music industry for 8 years now - she has sacrificed a lot and worked extremely hard with nothing to show for it. She's met with executives at 2 major record labels that have both been impressed by her talents, but the follow up calls always consist of them hinting that she needs some sort of surgical enhancements to make it... it's sad, but that's just how the business is. She's never cared about money or fame or anything like that (few people actually make any money in the music industry, contrary to popular belief), she's just passionate about performing - it's when I see her at her happiest. This video is from one of the many contests she's been a runner up in... she's never won a contest due to them all being decided by whoever gets the most friends to watch it (so they can boost ratings/traffic). I understand there are people fighting wars and there are people dying of unfortunate diseases who are more deserving than someone who wants to sing for a living. But, it would mean the world if I could at least make her feel appreciated. She's helped me get through hard times and has a good heart (not your typical music industry personality). I want to surprise her by having her see that lots of people have at least watched her perform. Thanks, Reddit! Oh, and sorry for it being Witney, I'm sure you've heard more than enough over the past week.. this was just one of her few recorded performances I could find. **TL;DR - Friend calls. She's upset and feels like a failure. Been trying to 'make it' in the music biz for 8 years with no luck. I want to make her feel appreciated by showing her that at least lots of people have seen her perform.

Click link below and sign up to this website (YOU CAN USE A FAKE EMAIL). They don't verify the email. It take 2 seconds.

Throwaway account just incase. 

I was expelled from high school for a ""junior prank"" I did. My GPA was shit (2.6) and I had no aspirations to go to college. I moved to California when I was 17 after getting my GED and just worked for a year. Going to the beach, surfing, skim boarding, and long boarding for a whole year. Life was amazing. But then I had a HUGE realization: I hated my job and my life. I needed an education to get a career; not just a job. I needed to go back to school to live a life worthy of dying with.

Needless to say, my Mom was THRILLED with my decision and told me ""just focus on getting your associates degree, that's all I want"". 2 hard years later of learning how to study and be in school I did it! I graduated with my associates. I applied to a bunch universities I wanted to transfer to, both dream schools and back up easy schools. 

The letter came in the mail and I was accepted to Colorado State- Fort Collins. You have no idea the feeling that I had the moment I realized I made it into an actual university. That I'm actually smart enough to belong in a university. My Mom was so happy she teared up in the eyes. A moment I will remember for the rest of my life. But it gets better. 

My top choice school was the prestigious University of Rochester. I didn't think I had a chance to get in, and the deadline to reply to their decision was a month away, and I hadn't even heard anything back! 

I was taking a nap that afternoon after work, and my Dad banged on my door and said ""you have mail, it's very important"". I knew just then what had happened. I flew out of bed and snatched up the large letter in his hand that had the words ""Welcome to the University of Rochester"". This was 4 days ago. It's still surreal and makes me teary eyed just thinking about it. I went from being a high school drop out to being accepted to an amazing school. It probably doesn't sound that great or amazing to most of you, but this is the single greatest event in my life so far.

Now why do I need your help? Rochester is a private school with an estimated cost of attendance of 60,000 a year. Yikes! I need to apply for all the scholarships I can. This one website gives me points that I can use to enter drawings for scholarship money (10k for one scholarship!). 

All I need you to do is click on this link and sign up for an account. The best part is you can use a fake email because they don't send a verification email or anything. I get 200 points per person who signs up! This will be a huge help to me. 

Please help me start my new life! I appreciate the help.

TL;DR: I need help getting scholarship money. Click link below and sign up to this website (YOU CAN USE A FAKE EMAIL). They don't verify the email. It take 2 seconds.

EDIT: I wanted to thank everyone who has signed up and gotten me points. Even though this is only for a drawing and might not get me the actual scholarship, it's incredible to see the support. Thanks! =]

Please post requests from these toys; I have multiples of some of them so please don't refrain from requesting a certain toy because you see someone else has requested it.

Also, if you've received a large ticket item already from halopolice or elsewhere, then be considerate and request a smaller item, if needed, so another family can be helped.

This offer is only open to those redditors who responded to halopolice's offer previously.

EDIT:  If anyone wants a description or a better photo of a toy, please ask.  This witch isn't the best photographer in Oz, that's for damn sure.  LOL

From the rules he told me it is basically cards that are dragons, but each dragon has parts, a head, wings, tail, body, etc. And there are two other cards, Helper cards, and (Honestly I need to ask that one). 

But I thought, being that I had no money this year, that I would make him some cards digitally on the computer. I have some skills in Photoshop. So the card itself, along with the background, stats, etc, isn't an issue. 

The issue is that I am not an artist can can't draw the dragons well. Besides the fact I don't want to use images off the net. I am wondering if anyone would be willing to do at least 2 dragons for the game, in this case 2 heads, 2 bodies, 4 wings, 2 tails. I can give details on what the dragons are suppose to be and show you want images off the net he did like for them.

I want to make these for him because he grew up here with me, when my family was here, but then he moved away and we haven't seen him in a while, it was hard to get the money together to even bring them to us, but we did in the end.

I'm frustrated, so i'm giving things away, starting with a PSP Go. I don't use it, and am hoping someone else can make better use of it.

These kinds of things always get all kinds of response, because it's some fancy gadget, so I might get picky. If you are interested, tell me. I don't know. Tell me something funny or something. Just make me forget about my stupid problems for a little while. 

Whoever I pick gets a PSP Go (no games on it, but log into the Playstation Network and download all the demos you desire I guess, and I know it's a PSP Go and not a Vita or a regular PSP, but it's what I have to give), a docking station and HD connection wire to an HDTV, soft case, and the power cord/charger.

I'll pick someone in a few days after I wallow in Diablo 3 for a while. Will check in on the post pretty often and hopefully get some replies that make me feel like things are still ok and life is still enjoyable.

I like to just pretend everyone that tries for it will be the kind of person that isn't just doing it to get some free gear and doesn't really have any need or use for it, but even then, so be it. My intentions are what matter and giving people things when I can makes me feel better.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
**EDIT:** Wanted to thank everyone for their interest and support and advice. I actually did try to sell it to a game store and a pawn shop and both would only give me enough for barely even a small fraction of one months interest on the debt. I feel like i'd get more benefit emotionally from making someone else's day. Last time I sold off gaming stuff to a pawn shop for a shit price, I regretted it (and still do to this day) simply because I feel like I just got ripped off instead of the money helping with anything. I do have other things i'm selling to try and help out. Some quite reluctantly, but sometimes you gotta do what you don't want to.

I am not out living on the streets and am not starving. I have a good life. I definitely have my share of struggles as well. This debt is just weighing on me pretty hard as those of you in debt know how it does. It isn't an overly massive  debt, just a big enough debt that it is affecting some things like this planned trip and any and all luxuries in the foreseeable future. I still have a great life in general. I just got into this spot, and hopefully eventually someday i'll be back on top of it. Who knows, maybe there will be that day in a few more years where I get to go see the girl...

I appreciate your stories and awesome encouraging thoughts. It really does lift my spirits to know there are good people out there with good intentions that care about others.

I will choose someone soon and get in contact with them. I really wish I could help everyone. I love RK and sending things out to people when I can. I've received a couple things and given out a lot of things as well and it makes me feel great about humanity, even at these times I feel like things are spiraling down, RK helps me remember there are good people out there.

I will try and reply to posts as well, but some things were mentioned multiple times and saying the same thing 10 times can be weird.

I used my last paycheck to cover the copays on my surgery today.  I am flat broke, in severe pain, hungry and miserable.  I had oral surgery today and had 8 teeth removed, my jaw chipped, shaved and reshaped.  The pain is intense.  The bleeding is non-stop.  The swelling is insane! I am miserable and I am here to ask for your help..please!!!!!




I am reaching out for help in getting things I can eat while I recover.  I'm only allowed liquids, soup and soft things.  Of course, none of which we have here at home.  We don't have a lot but, certainly nothing that fits the bill of my needs.



Oral surgeon said to expect a long recovery process.  Quite possible nerve damage, lots of swelling, pain and discomfort.  Boy, he never lied let me tell you.  This pain is so intense, I've literally spent my entire day whimpering or crying.  I hurt so bad.  I'm so hungry but, can't eat right now...as mentioned, nothing suitable.



I've made an amazon wishlist with soups, pudding, aleve (for the pain), gauze pads (to pop in my mouth to suck up the blood), some juice and I believe that's all.  I honestly can't remember...my brain is on overload.  It isn't a lot of stuff but, it would sure mean a whole hell of a lot if someone could help me out.



I will no doubt pay it forward or back if the helper chooses.  I just really need help right now.  Please?  I'm located in Ohio, USA.  The road to recovery is going to be an interesting one!! I have no help, my kids and I alone...it is hard man, really hard.  I need a little bit of relief.  I thank you for reading, considering and any help given to me.

My friend is a teacher and she had this random ""valentine's themed"" sign that she would use to teach the kids about the Holiday.  It was pretty funny looking and I noticed it in her car.  She asked me, ""oh ha ha, do you want that?"" and I kind of did because the monkey is awesome.

I'm not big on hoarding and don't have a lover at the moment so, I decided I could just leave it on someone's car at random and maybe ""make their day"".

Then I got to thinking that maybe it WOULDN'T be such a good idea because:

a)  The owner of the car could be in a relationship that is NOT going well and this could cast an air of suspicion of cheating or weirdness on so many levels that my simple attempt at random kindness could actually result in some wackness.  No good.

b)  The owner of the car could literally drive themselves insane wondering WHO left that for them and/or, worse, ask someone they ""HOPE"" it was from if they left it for them and......NOPE.  Crushed.

So, I decided to make a full disclaimer that I selected their car at random and hope they have a great day.

This was my very first planned act of kindness that is RANDOM and I guess it was pretty selfish when I think about it because I just didn't want this silly monkey to go in the trash.

I am a single dad with a 12 year old son who has had custody of him since he was 2. We are both on social security disability, my back is done and he has borderline Asperger’s. We have been living at my grandmother’s house for the past 6 years.  While helping to take care of her he and I have developed a very close relationship with her all these years. We have been though a lot the past year and she recently passed away on sept 15th 2011 86 years young from cancer.  We no longer have a place to live and were just recently offered an apartment that we can move into in 2 weeks. My grandmother had a reverse mortgage on the house and I have to leave because the bank owns it.
With limited funds and no money to rent a U-Haul from MA to NH or the $500 security deposit for the apartment. I am afraid of becoming homeless for the first time in my life. I don’t want my son to think I am a failure. We have developed such a strong bond these past few years. The apartment is subsidized and is based on my income so I can afford it. It’s just getting moved in and Christmas that is killing me. If any of you could help out. I can’t even begin to thank you for your gratitude.  I can provide whatever you need for verification including the obituary, reverse mortgage, apartment info, etc… I have never done this before so i don't know if you need my bank info or what. Thank you all so much in advance.

  I'm not asking for anything, except maybe some good thoughts or virtual hugs or something.

 Have you ever had a period in your life where *nothing* goes right?  Yeah, me too.  I've been struggling for a few years, and today was the straw that broke the camel's back.  Another car t-boned me in an intersection, and it looks like my car will be totaled.  Because it's 10 years old and has 100k+ miles, it probably won't get fixed (according to my insurance agent)...and it wasn't even my fault.

  I'm a single mom (technically married, but husband lives in England) with two kids, 17 and 10.  I was medically retired from the military with a 100% disability rating.  This was due to a botched surgery by an AF doctor, and I'm now in chronic pain daily.  And of course the accident today exacerbated that (seatbeat trauma on damaged area), so yeah.  Fun times.

  We've been struggling for quite a while financially living on just my retirement.  I've had two jobs since I retired, but lost both due to my physical condition.  I live in a very rural area where jobs are hard to come by, and most of those are manual labor or truck driving.  I'm educated, was an officer so have tons of leadership experience along with more practical skills, and can't find a stinking job to save my life.  I'm either ""overqualified"" or it's manual labor I can't do.

Now I've lost the only mode of transportation I have.  My daughter can't get to her job.  I can't get even to the grocery store (rural area, no buses).  I'm just really frustrated.  I was already stressed about Christmas coming up and feeling the good old mommy guilt for not being able to provide much for my kidlets and this really has freaked me out.  

Anyway, like I said I just needed to vent.  It's been a good 5 years of bad bad luck and I'm just so tired of struggling.  Any helpful words of encouragement would be lovely!!  Thanks for reading this, I just really needed to dump it all somewhere.

Edit to add:  If this is disjointed, I'm sorry. I'm on a good amount of pain meds at the moment and feeling really sorry for myself. :(

**EDIT:  Thank you all so much!**  It's really amazing to me how some compassionate, kind words from strangers can help so much!  I came on here a couple hours ago just completely miserable and tired of struggling, and you've helped me so much.  And please still post even though I've added this edit...more kind words would be lovely! :)  You guys rock!

I'm sorry, I forgot to append the title. **

Hello /r/randomkindness. I'm not sure if this post belongs here or not, so I apologize if not.

My daughter Sarah has been suffering from Crohn's Disease for ten years and it's not an overstatement, I think, to say that she's barely been surviving it. I have Crohn's myself, for 28 years now, and I've been through a lot, but nothing like her. Treatment after treatment fails for her after working only a short time, or worse, causes such a bad reaction that the medication itself actually has hospitalized her twice.

She has joint pain throughout her entire body after a bad reaction to Remicade a few years ago, and when she gets up off the floor you can hear every bone in her body crack, like a sack of twigs.
Sarah's little sister, Izzy, is two. Until Monday, we thought she might be deaf. Now we're not sure what's wrong. She has a ""diagnosis"" of autism, but that was given to us by a speech pathologist who only saw her for 45 minutes. We think she might have suffered neurological damage from childhood jaundice but can't be sure. If there is damage, it's too ""mild"" to diagnose, so she gets ""autism"" instead. Izzy can barely speak and the words she does say are garbled and hard to understand. She has trouble with tasks like putting shoes on or taking them off, dressing, undressing, walking on uneven terrain... all things that she should be able to do, or at least attempt successfully around 50% of the time, at age 2. We have seen neurologists, audiologists, and now we've resigned ourselves to just taking her to speech and behavioral therapy for autism in the absence of another diagnosis. Izzy is a happy, affectionate, smilling, beautiful girl who LOVES hugs and kisses, loves to ""sing"", dance, play peek-a-boo, is incredibly imaginative and acts out spontaneous, imaginary scenes with her toys. If it's Autism, it must be incredibly MILD autism. I'd like to be able to get more frequent and more varied therapy for her than is generally available through usual channels like our state's early intervention programs (which are backlogged and inefficient), but that takes resources that again, I'm forking over monthly to creditors.

I've posted on /r/assistance before, on a longshot, asking for advice or help with our debt. Currently, 25% of my take-home pay is going to Citibank so that we'll have a prayer of being debt free in around 4 years, providing there are no major problems between now and then. This is necessary because just the interest alone on this debt is leeching SO MUCH of our household income that it's literally destroying our family's well being. We can't take Sarah to clinical trials even if we got accepted to one because they're too far away and we can't afford plane tickets, hotels, or whatever, because of the $800-$1000 per month that I pay Citibank each month to keep ahead of the interest charges. Bankruptcy won't work for us. We'll be categorized Chapter 13 and then instead of our own aggressive repayment schedule, we'll have a court ordered, mandatory one with no flexibility which will make things even more nightmarish than they are now.
Like I said in the title, Sarah has written a novel. She spent almost a year getting up every morning before dawn and writing before school. She wrote after her homework was done. She wrote on holidays, school vacations, sick days, and snow days. When her joint pain became too severe for her to sit at her desk, she lay on the couch and wrote with pencil and paper.

Sarah wanted to sell her novel as an e-book to try to help our family out of this situation, so over the past few weeks I edited and proofread it, created a cover (with a photo kindly donated by a professional photographer), wrote a foreword, and published the book to both Kindle and Nook.

You can read about the book here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/

You can read about Sarah's history, with cameos by Izzy, here:

http://www.sarah-story.com

And the regularly updated blog is here:

http://www.sarah-story.com/news


Would any of you consider sharing the URL for the book (http://www.sarah-story.com/sarahs-writing/) through social media, friends, colleagues, classmates, whatever you feel might be appropriate, if you're so inclined? There is a link on that page to download the book for free in EPUB format for the curious, and a donate link for ""tips"" if you like it, so it's not even necessary to buy the book if you want to read it, and you can pay what you want, even if it's $0. On Nook or Kindle, the book is $2.99.  (** UPDATE: non-US customers may have taxes or other fees added, please read the screen carefully before purchasing **)

Like I said, I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I would dearly love any assistance anyone might give in spreading the word about this novel.

We're in Connecticut. I don't mean to be melodramatic, but it's getting cold here and we have about 1/4 of a tank of oil left and I'm not sure where the money for a refill, and/or for firewood for our woodstove, is going to come from. I'm already paying most of our bills two weeks late, and this week I had to take two days off unpaid to bring Izzy to a specialist consultation and a sedated outpatient diagnostic procedure. Things are getting bad. If we can generate interest in Sarah's book, it might bring some relief.

Thank you and kudos to you if you managed to read all of this. I'm not even sure where I'd begin on a TL;DR. Sorry if I've rambled.


** EDIT - Reddit, I am overwhelmed. Since this submission was posted, so far (as of lunchtime Friday) we've sold at least 61 copies of the book and have received nearly $500 in paypal donations, which will pay for 6-7 weeks worth of heating oil, which is good timing since it just started snowing outside last night. Thank you very, very much guys &amp; gals &amp; others. There are good people here. Sarah is extremely excited that people are reading her book. **

** EDIT 2 - We've lost our power, we have no water, and there's an oak tree hanging from the power lines in our driveway blocking most of the yard. Literally an oak tree, not a branch. We were able to use some of the donations to buy fuel for a generator we were loaned, but he generator blew when I hooked it up incorrectly due to bad advice. Still, redditors, without your donations we wouldn't have been able to go buy $100 worth of non-perishable food items at Walmart when we lost everything in our refrigerator. Thank you again.

Here is a list of the items I am most commonly asked for:

TOILETRIES: - deodorant - body wash (old spice is really popular) - shampoo/conditioner - toothpaste - toothbrushes - baby wipes - mouthwash - suntan lotion - chapstick - tissue

GEAR: - SOCKS!! Specifically, [these](http://www.extremeoutfitters.us/darntoughmountaineeringbootsockextracushion.aspx) are preferred overall, but any very thick/wool olive drab or black socks are accepted - headlamps, LCD and LED clip lights or anything for them to use hands-free - boots, any of [these](http://www.extremeoutfitters.us/search.aspx?find=400g+insulation) - Duct tape, 100mph tape, or any thick industrial tape - ziploc bags, specifically any that have a zip seal and can be used to keep items free of sand/rain - weapon cleaning tool, [this one](http://www.extremeoutfitters.us/catm-4cleaningtool.aspx) - Sunglasses, [these](http://www.extremeoutfitters.us/numaopticstasblackoutpoint.aspx) are a favorite, but again - they are expensive. We will accept any QUALITY pairs. - hand/foot warmers - gloves, [these](http://www.extremeoutfitters.us/gloves.aspx) are some examples of acceptable kinds - first aid and med supplies, nothing too major but advil, band aids, sanitizer, and disinfectant are great ideas - lotion - nail files/clippers - matches - eye drops, visine, contact solution - tampons - mini fans

FOOD/GOODS: - Tobacco: dip, cigarettes, rolling tobacco, whatever. - beef jerky - power bars, protein bars or energy bars - red bull - regular &amp; sugar free - candy (preferably not chocolate for obvious reasons), but licorice, hard candy, anything else is good - chips - easy mac, noodle bowls, or other prepared foods that can be microwaved. Please NO banquet meals, hungry man, lean cuisines or anything that is perishable or needs refrigeration. - water additives like propel powder, kool aid, Gatorade powder, crystal light etc. - peanuts/sunflower seeds

COMFORT ITEMS: - books!! Great books, not the kind you'd buy at a garage sale for ten cents. A lot of the guys/ladies really want something they can do to take their mind off of things, and a great book can be an amazing alternative - comics/manga/graphic novels - lots of these guys LOOOOVVEEE good comics, ANY would be fabulous - games: chess, checkers, cards, etc. - video games/dvds (NOTE: if sending these items, please mark them with a sharpie to note something for the troops, these are often stolen and sold back to soldiers and marking them helps to prevent them from re-selling these items) - riddle books (please no Sudoku or crossword puzzles) - music - pens/notebooks/envelopes - magazines - posters (NOTE: we cannot accept ANY posters with inappropriate content - nudity, offensive material, political or religious statements)

Other items you can send us: - Letters or thank you cards to include with our packages, if you like you can include a return address for troops to send a note back to you - homemade items (NOTE: these items, if edible, MUST BE SEALED) - international phone cards!  These guys can only call home so often, and a lot of the time they are asked to pay for their calls, these help immensely.  - postage!!  Each box costs us $11-13 to send out, so any stamps or postage help is accepted as well - reddit paraphernalia!! Since this group is through reddit, I plan on putting some type of reddit sticker or symbol the boxes. Maybe we'll even see some pop up on their humvees and other places.

Please don't send us: - alcohol - pornography - weapons - ANY pork products, items made with pork, etc. - drugs (the illegal/prescription kind, obviously) - hate mail, come on guys.

Many of these are restricted or banned, even if we try to send them they will be taken away or removed by customs. And hate mail just sucks.

I can't tell you how awesome it feels to get photos of units who have gotten your care packages. It's addicting. Thank you guys so much for your help!!!

I had been invited to join my friend for a dinner at a restraunt in San Diego for her friend's birthday. Well, we had a group of maybe 20 or more Marines (male and female alike), sitting at a long table when this older couple approach and ask if we are Marines. We answer that we are, hesitantly, but the kind couple proceed to smile and hand each and every one of us a christmas card in sealed envelope. We smile and gratefully say thank you, and remark to one another about how thoughtful it was of them to do such a kind thing. Well, me being the curious one, I open up the card to see what it said, and to my ultimate surprise, out drops a crisp, brand new $100 bill. Needless to say, each person at that table stops mid sentence/action to do the same. Low and behold, EVERY card contained the same. I don't think I'll ever forget that night, because it was such a random act of kindness, on a day where most military people are far from home and not in the absolute happiest spirits.

I do not provide domain registration or hosting, but can give you links (affiliate) to $.99/month hosting if you want.

If you don't want the site, but need reliable, inexpensive hosting let me know and I'll give you the link.  I don't want to post it here because I have seen how some redditors react to affiliate links.

I am very well versed in html, xhtml, css, and am able to do simple jquery/javascript things like image galleries and very simple php work (mostly manipulating other people's code to fit my needs). 

 

I was just helped out big on RandomKindness and would like to pay it forward as best I can, using the skill set I have.

I was going to post this in /r/freedesign but wanted to do it here first.

I did this once before, but the people I was making sites for stopped communicating and giving me input/copy text/images...everything. So I'll try it again.

I do have a few ***conditions***:

**PleasePleasePlease** be prepared for:

A lot of communication through email.

A lot of questions from me, I'm not a mind-reader.

I AM NOT a graphic designer.  I am slightly above novice with GIMP and Inkscape, but nothing more.  I can resize/make thumbnails, etc.... but not a lot of custom graphics.  ***Google images is not 

a source for graphics unless specified by the creator***

Please have or be ready to get any images and copy text you feel you will be needing.  I can edit copy if  you'd like.

Have a basic idea of what you want, it would help me if you could send me a couple links to sites you like, and a couple to sites you do not like. Hell, open up MS Paint and draw a quick sketch of 

a layout (where you'd like navigation, logo, images, text..) this is not necessary, but it could help us both visualize what you want.

Have a color-scheme in mind.  It doesn't have to be a concrete plan, but it does help to have an idea.

Keep in mind that this may take a little while to complete.  I am not a wizard.  You will be put into my queue which, right now, only has 2 simple projects in it.

No adult content (*porn*)

Blog themes are a pain in the rear and I cant justifiably do one for free.

I can try my hand at Reddit's CSS if you're a mod and need help with your subreddit.  I've never looked at it before, but CSS is CSS is CSS so it can't be too difficult.


Not necessarily first come/first served, we'll have to find out exactly what your needs are and if we come to an agreement you'll be put into my queue in the order agreements are arranged.

I don't want to take up half your site with my branding, links to my site...etc, but I do ask that I am allowed to put a small text link in your footer with a link to my design site (which is currently 

being redesigned and switching hosts, so no link).

I have personally made cards arriving for him and pictures drawn by adorable little kids being sent. 

It is amazing, hilarious, overwhelming and beyond thoughtful. All for a lonely little boy on the spectrum no one has ever met.  Jamie is going to realize he isn't so lonely now!

Jamie even found a penpal his age through this!

The [Triad House](http://http://triadhouse.org) is an incredible organization that provides a home for LGBT youth in NJ that are homeless due to their sexual orientation/gender. These teens are given the opportunity to go to school, be safe and have opportunities they may otherwise not have had due to their families or environments prior to entering the Triad House. 

This spring, the Triad House is hosting a fundraiser -- ""Triad House Ball,"" to help raise money to keep the Triad House running for teens in need. The ball is open to people of all ages (though specifically targeting teens/college students) and an entry fee will be charged that will go to helping fund this incredible project started by [LifeTies](http://www.lifeties.org). We believe as of right now that there will be a ""VIP section"" for adults that wish to attend and be a part of such an important event for the group.

In order to make this event a success, and to meet our fundraising goals, we are looking for sponsorship and donations to help teens in need. This project is truly beautiful and inspiring, and the kids are so happy and exposed to opportunities they never dreamed possible. As a result, I am reaching out to the Reddit Community to help accomplish our goal of raising as much money as possible to keep this project going.

I am more than happy to answer questions to the best of my ability regarding the Triad House and the semi-formal we will be hosting so please feel free to inbox them or ask below. I don't know everything since I am relatively new to this project, but my university's gay-straight alliance is partnering with other universities to help make this event a success.

**We are in need of**:

* Donations - food, drink, condoms. We'd love to be able to offer condoms at the event, but can't do so without donations!

* Monetary donations can be made [here](https://app.etapestry.com/hosted/LifeTies/OnlineDonation.html) or checks may be accepted as well. Please contact me if you wish to write a check, or use the address located on the LifeTies/TriadHouse websites. **A check would be the best means for ensuring the donation money goes directly to the Triad House rather than to LifeTies as a whole.**

* DJ services - if you are located in the central NJ area (or NJ in general) or quite frankly anywhere, and are willing to donate your services to help provide the music and entertainment for the dance, we would greatly appreciate it! Please comment here and then PM me if you're interested.

* Decorations - if you have any decorations / flowers / etc. that you think would be beneficial to have at the event, then we would love them! The atmosphere is part of the fun of a semi-formal!

* Sponsorship - if your place of business would like to arrange to sponsor this event and have your name mentioned in our advertising/press/banners etc. please private message me. We have received sponsorship from a major pharmaceutical company already!

* Media/advertisement - if you have any connections in the media/advertising industry and would be willing to donate your time and effort to helping the Triad House and the Triad House Ball, we would greatly appreciate it: the more word of mouth, the better! 

* Anything else you think we could use!

I am a manager (I hire people) where I work and I see a lot of awful resumes come through, so I have decided to share my abilities and talents with peers, who are in a similar situation, graduating soon/recently, and worried about their future employment/careers.


How I envision this process:

• Send me your current resume (all the language you want)
• Clarify the type of employment you're looking for, so I can cater layout &amp; typography accordingly.
• Although I am not officially an 'expert', I am willing to add a premature editing phase to help you with language, tone, etc. This will require a bit of communication.

Post any questions below, and I will clarify anything for you! I'm setting it at 2-3 'clients' to begin with, and if it all goes well, I may accept more.

1320957857.0,29,self.RandomKindness,m7udd,[RK Suggestion] Dealing with hostile comments &amp; potential scammers,ransim,34,5,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/m7udd/rk_suggestion_dealing_with_hostile_comments/,"There has been a rash of comments recently on posts by users that are hostile, inflammatory, or negative. Generally these posts have to do with a user attempting to call out another user as a scammer or someone who is excessively asking for things.

Likewise we have people who feel that some people are requesting/asking for items to often or are lying about their situation to engender sympathy.

RandomKindness is not about helping the needy, its about randomly offering kindness to another redditor for any reason or no reason at all. There is nothing wrong with offering to those who need it, but its not a requirement. There is also nothing wrong with requesting for whatever reason or no reason.

That said, we also promote the idea of kindness in everything you do in the subreddit, this includes comments on other people's posts. Even when you disagree or feel they may have shady ulterior motives, please always remember to be kind.

** **

**Few tips for dealing with hostile comments:**

* **Use the report function -** At the bottom of every comment and post is a report link. This will send a message to the moderators so they know to check the comment. 

* **Don't feed the troll -** Trolls live to get a rise out of you, the best thing you can do is ignore them and report the comment. The moderators will see the report and remove it if necessary.

* **Don't drop to their level -** Don't sling insults back at them, if you must reply do so as politely and kindly as you can. Be the better person.

**Protecting yourself from scammers:**

* **Ask for verification -** Scammers are unfortunately a reality, don't be afraid to ask for verification, just do so politely. At the same time don't be insulted if someone asks for verification. 

* **Check their comment history -** Has this person been a redditor for awhile? Do they have a good comment history? Keep in mind no history does not mean someone is a scammer, but it may mean you will want to ask for verification.

* ** Check the [reddit givers list](http://www.sdorm.org/redditgivers/)
** - Reddit givers provides a list where givers can report items they give to others and those who receive can self report items they receive. 

**What to do when you've identified a potential scammer:**

* **Do not post a comment calling that user out -** These sort of posts only create drama and flame wars that only further muddle the situation for moderators attempting to figure out whats going on.

* **[Send a message to the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23RandomKindness) -** Send us a message, provide a link to the questionable post, and a clear statement on why you feel the user is a scammer or why a post should be removed. If you have proof available please provide it. Remember a user does not need to be needy to post a request here.

**TL;DR -** Be kind, even when you think someone may be a scammer, and when in doubt use the report function and let mods deal with hostile comments or potential scammers.",,False,self,t5_2szh3,True,,SENT,True,t3_m7udd,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/m7udd/rk_suggestion_dealing_with_hostile_comments/,moderator

We're from New Zealand! My little brother Isaac is six years old (he'll be 7 in December). My eldest brother Ryan, (21) and I (23) are both moving out of home. Ryan is moving to Florida, and I am moving to Wellington. I know that Isaac is going to miss us a lot, because we try really hard to spend a lot of time with him and do cool things for him.

If anyone has kids around his age, I'm sure he would love to have some overseas penpals writing to him to keep him company! If your kids want to write Isaac a letter, PM me and I'll give you the address.

Lots of love,

in a nutshell, a woman put a $100 deposit on her dream wedding gown before her future husband hurt his back on job. realizing that they would not be able to afford the $1000 dress, she asked that instead of giving money back the shop pass it on to next bride to be. she said it was a part of a gift for a friend, passing on random kindness around town. the dress shop, hearing this, decides this is the kind of woman they want wearing this dress and donated it to them. the owner then goes around and gets other companies to donate in order to get them a free wedding and honeymoon!

this is an amazing story and i really thought it was a great valentine day story. not the wedding itself, but the love for others that caused this woman to donate money she really could have used herself, as welol as the love from the store owners that lead them to seek donations for the couple. to me, this story IS what this subreddit is about!

At [We Deliver Love](http://www.wedeliverlove.com). we have volunteers from all over the US that send homemade gifts (typically baked goods, desserts, homemade presents like blankets) to people in need of a pick me up this holiday season.

At our website you can nominate anyone you know to receive one of these gifts. If you know someone whom you've always wanted to thank, or maybe is feeling down this holiday season, or stressed, or for any reason at all, sign them up and they will be randomly matched with one of volunteers! Boxes have been shipping out for a few weeks, and our goal is to have everyone receive a gift by the New Year.

You may also volunteer to send a gift, anything your heart desires! We've had breads, scarves, blankets, necklaces, letters, cookies, and more sent out so far, and I love seeing what people come up with. It's all about the love of giving, and letting everyone know they have someone in their corner. 

You do not have to volunteer to nominate someone or vice versa, though of course you are welcome to both if you like.

This is people helping people, especially through what can be a tough time of year for many.

If you're interested, please check out our website, or visit our [facebook page](http://www.facebook.com/wedeliverlove) for more details, or you may ask me any questions you may have.

Post what part of the planet you are located in as well as the reason why you would like a mapley care package (recently put together by me in Ottawa's Byward market), and I will send it off to one lucky person.  Contents include  maple syrup, soft and hard maple sugar candies, and maple butter (which regardless of the name does not actually contain butter).

I'll let Reddit upvotes along with maybe some flips of a quarter help me decide who gets it.  After that I'll PM the lucky winner for a mailing address.

My semi-arbitrary decision will be made ~~Friday~~ Wednesday morning some time after my first coffee of the day.

There is one rule however, only folks living outside of the maple superpower countries/regions are eligible (i.e. no one living in Canada or the north-eastern US).  Not much sense in sending coal to Newcastle so to speak...

EDIT: I just realized that I'm going to have way too difficult a time deciding a winner from among all you maple-deprived folks...  Therefore I will be shutting this offer down Wednesday morning, and choosing the lucky winner of the maple sugary goodness at that time.  I will however be stopping by the maple syrup stand on my way home and will pick up about ~~10~~ 12 small bottles of syrup and some maple sugar candies to mail to random redditors who responded to this posting.  Be warned however - the maple sugar candies are more addictive than crack!!!

*******
Okay, so I read all the posts, lurked a bit, did some Loonie tossing and here's the verdict.
Mamayoda is the winner partially because of need (although I do realize that everyone needs maple syrup) , husband going through maple withdrawal, anniversary, coin toss, random luck, etc. So she gets the maple sugary care package. (PM ME YOUR MAILING COORDINATES)
________________________________________
The 12 semi-random runners up who will each receive a smaller (125ml) tin of syrup as well as some soft maple sugar candies) are:

BrerBunny - because of musicality, 17 year old angst, and parental agave syrup abuse

Ludidify - because of being the furthest person away

DonaldJDarko - because I loved that movie, also sounds like he is in maple withdrawal

Sortika - because of having maple-needy mother

Alfet - as long as you promise not to go to war with Canada's UK cousins over the Falklands/Malvinas again

Utasora - because of yet another case of maple withdrawal, student, etc.

Sword_of_Morning - because of rotten brat &amp; Texas

jldiaz910 - because it's never over until the fat lady sings

AsIfYouCared - for invoking the Maple Gods

Andaroodle - because he will need something to keep him sane while living in that bomb shelter (note: if you think Y2K was bad, wait until Y3K hits! I'd stay in the shelter if I was you)

dbcooper2012 - to help you suck up to your room-mates

ImperialMinion - because of yet more maple syrup withdrawal, student, etc...

PM ME YOUR MAILING COORDINATES AND I WILL GET THE PACKAGES SENT OUT TO YOU ASAP.
________________________________________

But those of you who are not among the ""Chosen ones"" need not despair. Pyrexic from Montreal has offered to join forces with me to help fill this DESPARATE need for maple sugar products.

In fact I encourage any of the Canadian (or New England) Redditors out there to feel free to join in and send Maple sugary goodness to the people I didn't get to. I also encourage people to post the user names of the folks you do get to so that we can tell who is still in a state of need/despair/whatever.

This is one for the books ladies and gents. The other day I held a contest highlighting you for your community's awesomeness. There were 40 of you wonderfully enthusiastic redditors that participated and I think the entire thing went off without a hitch! There were requests from book sets, to metallica wallets, to postage stamps! I want to say ***THANK YOU*** to all you who have made this community pretty rad! But, as with all contests, a winner must be declared.

**THE WINNER FOR THE CONTEST IS:**

* [CUTIEJUDY](http://www.reddit.com/user/CUTIEJUDY/)

**AND IN THE COMMENTS, SHE REQUESTED:**

* A NICE SMELLING CANDLE AND THE REST OF THE MONEY TO HELP [NOTURUSUALREDDITOR](http://www.reddit.com/user/noturtypicalredditor)'s CAUSE. 
HE POSTED ASKING FOR HELP WITH A [WISHLIST](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/mpp4f/requestcharity_ww_a_reddit_christmas_miracle_help/) FOR CHILDREN WHO'S MOTHER HAD BEEN KILLED.

Here is where things get ***really awesome!*** 

The story/charity that Noturusualredditor posted about is also the one that [LarahZee](http://www.reddit.com/user/LarahZee), the most upvoted comment in the contest thread, wanted to help!

Many of you commented saying that if you won, *then you wanted the money to go to this family!*

What a great way for this contest to end up! ***I did not plan for this to happen!*** I thought I was just going to be getting someone a gift worth that amount!

For the sake of transparency, [here](http://i.imgur.com/W01HD.png) is a screenshot of the list in Excel I made of all of your names, and the random number generator I used to pick the number!

I WILL ENCOURAGE EVERYONE IN THIS COMMUNITY TO GO INTO THE [COMMENTS OF MY CONTEST](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/mpw0p/congratulations_rrandomkindness_you_are_the/) AND FIND A GIFT THAT YOU WANT TO FUFILL FOR ANOTHER REDDITOR!

Thank you again to everyone! This has been a great experience for me and I hope that this subreddit will continue doing great things.

She knows basic commands and is house trained. She is very friendly and loves everyone she meets. I've never had a more cuddly, lovey dog.

Fellow Redditor Ohdub880 was in an accident, doctor fucked up in multiple ways, it was fixed by a doctor that wasn't a piece of shit, and they've been left in debt, which prevents them from being able to afford a lawyer to seek compensation.
Between a need for a malpractice suit to prevent the first doctor from repeating his incompetence and helping a fellow redditor cover the cost of damage from his negligence, is there anyone who would be willing to help Ohdub880 in receiving what they actually deserve?

Our budget for each other was only 10.00 this year, so we had to get creative. [Here is my original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/13x9wa/request_us_ms_help_me_give_my_husband_the_best/). Many of you had some extremely generous offers, and I was so excited to see him open it all. I seriously couldn't have done it without ya'll, and I'm so very thankful. He wants to send personal ""Thank You's"" in the mail, so if your box came with an address, he's doing that when he's off Monday.

  [Here is an album showing what all he got and from whom.](http://imgur.com/a/YF2ks)

  Also, ThePenguinBro offered to buy him something new if I knew what he'd like. I said I knew if he were to get something new, he'd prefer the boys got something instead, so he did just that! [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/14h7qj/rk_thanks_to_thepenguinbro_you_generous_redditors/) is my ""Thank You"" I already posted to him. User nmkenney sent me issues 1-100 of The Walking Dead for the Kindle app. He was so excited about that! ChopTastik sent him some things via his favorite computer game, Tibia. Numerous people sent cards and kind words, which we have hanging on the wall! 

  No one asked for me to cover shipping, so with my 10.00 budget, I did some small random acts of kindness. I gave someone .60 PayPal on RK, gave to a couple of people on RAoA, taped 1.00 to a coke machine, and paid for someone's drink at Sonic.

  For those interested, my present was a new wedding ring. We got married 4 years ago and had a small courthouse wedding and very inexpensive rings (about 50.00 for mine, 8.00 for his). I never made a fuss about not having a nice ring and have always been content with mine, but he said he wanted me to have a nicer one. [Here is my ring](http://i.imgur.com/gXE32.jpg). He said 10.00 was the ""down payment"" and he put it on a no-interest credit card and will pay it off over the next 2 years. Oh, my.

These won't be fancy but they will be warm. I made one for my other half, so you can see what it will look like, approximately:

http://i.imgur.com/KG0vn.jpg

Its made with a wool yarn, so it should keep you warm in the cold.

**Yarn:** http://www.lionbrand.com/yarns/we-thick.htm

**How this will work:**

I've chosen random numbers from ***1-100*** and will give the scarves to the people who guess the number. Please also post with your guess a color. I won't promise you'll get the exact color you want (depends on what the store has), but I can try.

It'll take me a bit of time to make each one as I won't start them till winners are chosen and I hit the store to buy the yarn.

**Edit:** Wow lots of replies! No one has managed to guess a number yet. Everyone gets one guess per day. I'll let this go until Friday at the latest and if no one guesses it I'll just randomly from the replies. ^_^

**Edit 2:** So far one correct guess, keep the guesses coming guys. I'll be letting all of the people who corrected guessed know when Friday rolls around. 

**Edit 3:** Bought the yarn for the first lucky random soul. I figure since it was a fairly popular color request I'll post a picture of the yarn. http://i.imgur.com/SV3qm.jpg You also get a random cat in the picture, and yes my desk is messy.

**Edit 4:** No one has managed to guess correctly yet, but some of you have gotten painfully close! This will go until  5 PM EST tomorrow (Nov 11) and then I'll choose someone randomly (maybe two I'm making good progress finishing the first scarf).

**First scarf progress:** http://i.imgur.com/U5FBs.jpg (this is actually from earlier yesterday its about twice this length already.

Sorry, wee bit of a delay after some post work shenanigans. No one did manage to guess the other number, which was 70. So I'm going to make scarves for the two people who got the closest with 71 and 69.

**Selected People:**

* manderso - 37
* duckvaginas - 69
* yayitscaroline -71

Grats guys! I'm making progress on manderso's scarf now, hoping I can try to get it finished this weekend and I'll start on the next one. I'll be sending PMs out to each of the selected people a bit later.

Anyway, I saw a picture on imgur about this subforum and had to wander over.  I love making people happy!  

I'm a semiprofessional jewelry artist and compulsive creator.  Right now, I'm in the same boat as a lot of people - hunting for a job that seems eternally elusive.  Since I have extra time to make things, I figure I might as well make people happy while doing that!  I'm here to help you make the ladies in your life happy.  Want to get something pretty for your significant other, but don't have any money to spend on frivolous things?  Know somebody that could use a fun little surprise?  Look no further!  I can also answer questions about making things, if you've got those!  I know where to buy the best (or most cost-effective) supplies, what metals are best to use where, and the best way to take a picture of a piece of jewelry with a dinky point and shoot.  

I should probably do a little lurking around to figure out the best way to run this thing, but I am excited about sharing!  I don't know what percentage of people I'll be able to send stuff to, as I don't know how many people will respond - I'll do my best.  I'd love to know a little about your intended recipient so that I can make the perfect piece of jewelry for her.  Oh, and if there is something that I have screwed up with this first post, let me know so that I can attempt to fix it!

Edit: One received, ten in the mail.  I'd love to know if you got anything - my post office workers gave me some funny looks, but didn't question my postage.  I don't think that they allow postage due once the workers have already okayed a package, but I live in fear of that happening.  Let me know if you end up having to pay an extra few cents.

If you are in Canada, I can send things to you.  It is not that much more expensive, and filling out customs forms makes me feel like I am sending important international stuff.

It's hard to ask, but I've hit the end of what I can do. I'm a Bipolar with Sleep Apnea. I lucked out when I was first diagnosed Jan 2010, and a rather nice woman gave me an old machine and mask for me to use. It's getting close to 2 years since I started using this equipment, and it's broken down and been rigged back together several times now. Due to my mental health, my doctors pushed for me to get Disability. I agree with them, and have been in the process of applying since March of this year. I'm on my last appeal, and will be going in front of a Judge within a couple months. I've had to move back in with my mother, who's unemployed at the moment as well.

I'm one of those people that are the first to offer help, and do what I can to help.

I guess specs on what I need would be a good thing. I need a Bipap machine that has a max pressure higher than 21. There is a lot of info online how to reset the pressure, so I can do that myself. The other thing I really need is a mask. I use a medium size, and am not scared about using a used one.

then the internet stopped working - it just needed reset- they threw a fit because they though we changed the password on them which we didnt - so we just said 'why should they get internet anyway- they dont pay for it, we do' so we changed it and didnt give them the new password- hope they would just man up and pay the $80 that they owed for the electric going up--- NOPE they moved out while we were asleep- last night- and didn't leave us the keys

I felt like that was the universe's little gift to me and now I would like to gift someone else.

I would like those that are in need of a little extra cash to write me below in the comments and tell me a little bit about why. I will be sending anywhere from $10 - $100. This will be a randomly picked amount. And I might even pick more than one person. Who knows!

I will give people a chance to post until June 14th, next Friday. Then after that I'll be picking someone and will send the lucky winner(s) a PM. Payment will be sent through PayPal.

EDIT: I just wanted to restate I will not be picking someone to receive the money until June 14th, which is still a week away. I apologize to those who are needing this money sooner. 
Also, I am reading everyone's comment. I just don't want to reply on any yet until the day I'm going to pick.

UPDATE: I had planned to let this post run until the 14th to give as many people as possible the opportunity to participate. Since the comments have basically stopped at this point I am going to just end it today the 13th instead. I did sit down and look over all the comments and actually ended up deciding on three people. I appreciate everyone that shared their story with me and let me peek a little inside your life and needs. I wish everyone luck with providing for yourself and families. I wish I could have helped all of you.

So, I'm a little perturbed lately. Sorry if this seems ranty. I've given and given and given, and only been thanked about 1 out of every 5 times (and you wonderful people know who you are and are why I continue to give). I don't seek public recognition for anything at all, but I at least expect a private message letting me know you received it. 


  I recently ordered someone a maternity outfit. No thanks. I sent my RedditGifts teacher 100.00 worth and got only a ""I got it. Thanks!"". No pictures or further comments. I bought someone a 40.00 box of diapers from Amazon. No thanks. Today at Walmart, I gave a homeless guy a 50.00 gift card and told him he could get whatever he wanted. His reply? ""Nothing very expensive"" and laughed. I mean, I guess he was kidding, but I was pretty hurt by it. I rarely have anything to give to the homeless like that, but I felt compelled to do so. I just rolled up my window and drove away.


  SO, Redditors, this offer is for someone who has requested something (or entered a giveaway) and thanked the gifter. (Anywhere on Reddit- here, RAoP, food_pantry, whatever). You must have thanked at least 2 days ago. I don't care what the gift was or how long ago it was. If public, just post a link to your thanks. If private, a screenshot of you thanking them is fine. I don't have a lot of money at all, but I try to give when I can, and I appreciate a heart-felt thank you. I'll leave this offer open for a day or so and will pick a winner tomorrow.

Want to see yourself in an epic fantasy world? the roaring 20s? a Lovecraftian hellscape? something more absurdist or abstract? I just need two things:

* A fairly decent, at least shoulders-up photo of you or the person you'd like me to use. The larger/higher quality the better, of course. You could also send me a few with different angles or expressions so I'll have more options for how I use it.
* A description, however detailed or vague, of what kind of setting or theme you're looking for, as well as any other particular aspects you have in mind. It'll be most fun, I think, if you give me a clear vision to go on but also leave me plenty of room for creative interpretation.

Because this takes a lot of work and time, I'll probably only do one or two, and I'll choose based solely on how interesting they/you sound to me. So make it compelling! I'll update when I've made a choice, so until I do feel free to submit your requests here or via PM.

Which end up being free.~~

~~Here is how to get them (read the ALL steps first):~~

~~1. [StickerMule](http://www.stickermule.com/unlock?ref_id=6027468601) 
Referral Link. This is the only way to get the $10 right away.~~

~~2. After you have signed up and everything go to [stickermule.com/reddit](http://www.stickermule.com/reddit)~~

~~3. Select what you like, you can choose pretty much any sticker you want for under $10.~~

~~4. On checkout check ""Use Store Credits."" you don't have to put credit card info but check ""Use Shipping Address"" under billing address.~~

~~and BOOM! free stickers.
They take about a week to process your stickers, but they email you every step of the way (including when they will ship your stickers.)
I though because this subreddit is about giving/receiving I would post it here.~~

**EDIT**: Doesn't work anymore, they have put a minimum of $50 to buy. It was too good to last long. Sorry guys.

**EDIT 2**: [1000 free Reddit stickers](http://www.stickermule.com/blog/2011/12/5/free-reddit-stickers) just put your name and address.

* **CONGRATULATIONS** everyone, we now have 2000+ subscribers

* **Goodbye [Kate](http://www.reddit.com/user/katiekatums)**
A sad news to start with. When I started this journey I was not sure it will be a success. At the start I forced one of my friend Kate from another sub-reddit to start being a mod here. I am glad she gave all she could in this limited time. Now that things are getting busy in other sub-reddit she wants to step down from RK. I am sure you all will join me in thanking her for her support so far.

* **NEW MOD(s)** This means that we now should probably hire a couple of mods.

  **In words of [ransim](http://www.reddit.com/user/ransim):** We need someone who seems to handle things in a levelheaded and kind manner. Even when calling something out for being suspicious I think we mods need to lead as an example. There is always a polite way to handle issues. Someone eager to help but also understands what this subreddit is about. Its about random acts of kindness not necessarily helping out the needy. Someone who has been involved with the subreddit, even if just as a commenter.

 **In summary** 

 You should believe what this community stands for and be active. 
 
 You should have some community management experience. 

 You should be able to manage things in a kind way.

 You should also state what times you are likely to be available (in GMT please)
 
 You should make your case of modship right here in comments and we will let the community decide, however final decision will be made by current group of mods.

* **Text only posts** I guess we should have taken this decision a long time ago, anyway better late than never. We are now a text only community. You can obviously post link in summary of your text submission. This way we can keep format as uniform as possible.

* **GET THE FLAIR!** I would like to remind everyone that **REQUESTED &amp; RECEIVED flairs are mandatory**. This shows the community if somebody is constantly being ignored or if somebody is already enjoyed a bit of random kindness. Getting OFFERED &amp; SENT is optional as we would not want to force you to show-off if you do not want to. If you see a requester with no flair please remind them politely in comments to get the flair. Same goes with receivers. Flair should can be requested on [flair.randomkindness.org.uk](http://flair.randomkindness.org.uk) however if there is any issue, [OhWhyBother](http://www.reddit.com/user/OhWhyBother) is now in-charge of assigning flair, any issue should be raised directly with him

* **UPVOTE ALL GOOD THINGS** Remember that our random acts of kindness are only visible to world when these are upvoted more. It makes me sad when I see an offer with 120 comments and just 20 upvotes. Be randomly kind, upvote submissions and make somebody's day.

I think you people are generous and wonderful. I think I have seen a lot of people confess some true hardship when they request things. I think I myself have confessed hardship when I have requested things. And here's a little bit more about myself. I have Bipolar disorder. I attempted suicide multiple times in the past. I'm in a better place than that now, but life is still sometimes very very hard. I'm a college student, like many of you, I'm flat broke, like many of you. I'm desperate for help and money. I'm desperate for, just what this subreddit is about, random kindness, and I know that for people that struggle with mental disorders, sometimes it's the simplest things in life for the rest of the world that become the hardest.

Every day on r/suicidewatch people say they are ready to end their lives. Every day on r/BipolarReddit people talk about how they suffer frightful hallucinations or had to have very expensive medications adjusted AGAIN, and it just makes me feel like if anyone needs some random kindness, it's the people in these subreddits. Even if the only thing you do is join the subreddit and tell someone in suicidewatch that their life is important, that might be the best form of kindness a person could offer.

When I found out about r/randomkindness, I began posting on EVERYTHING. ""Oh my gosh! That sounds awesome! Send it to me!"" I don't have much to give, but I've offered the little I have. There are so many of you that have offered beautiful artwork or music or just a heartfelt sentiment in the mail, and that is exactly the type of thing that can make someone on the verge of suicide reconsider their decision. 

Maybe this isn't the right place to preach about mental hardship and disorders, but I think the people in this subreddit are capable of making a difference. Sorry if reading this wasn't your thing and brought a downer onto your evening, but thank you if you bothered reading it all the way through.

""Depressed.  Cheer him up.""

My father is an amazing photographer, an incredibly kind person, and pretty much the best person I know. He's the sweetest man, and I wish I had the words to explain how amazing he is. Suffice it to say that he has always supported and loved me, even when it's been difficult, and I love him very, very much.

He is now 61 years old, and has been running his own photography/production company since he was in his late 20s. But times are hard for his industry, and most production work has gone north to Canada or overseas. My father has just lost one of his last major clients, for a television show on TNT, and he is feeling downtrodden and, for lack of a better word, obsolete. 

I am living overseas, and so is my twin sister. We are our parents' only children. Neither one of us can be there to give him a hug. I've sent him some cheery emails and happy quotes, but I want to do more...

I really wish I could clone this scooter, and give each of you one. I've chosen my recipient, and contacted them via PM. This has been a fantastic experience, and the amount of support I received made me feel all sorts of fuzzy inside. I only wish I could do more.**

*EDIT/NOTE: I realize now that I should probably put some sort of ""end date"" on this. Keep posting your stories until November 20. Then I will make my decision. I will likely notify the winner via PM, to get addresses and such, then simply post that a winner was found here in the thread. (Also to protect the winner from any sort of abuse.)*

Greetings, everyone.

It's getting closer and closer to the holidays, and having joined the reddit community this year, I decided I wanted give something back. Here's the backstory:

Back when I was in fifth grade, it was when the Razors were first introduced and quite popular. I begged my parents for one, but we were never well off. I can't remember, but I believe the original pricepoint on the basic model was $69-99. That was a LOT. I didn't get that scooter that year, and being a child, without the specific developmental skills to fathom problems outside of my own, I was upset. The next Christmas, I got one. However, I was in 6th grade, and a scooter was no longer considered cool. I rode it a couple times, then just put it away and never used it again. As I grew up, this is has always been a dark smudge when I think about my past. It's something that, at 23, I still feel horrible about. My parents got me the damn scooter I had whined about, just a little later when they could properly afford it, and I let it sit in a closet. 

So, I want a kid who will love this scooter and ride it every day and not be a shithead like me to have it. If you're hitting a rough patch and your son/daughter wants one this year and you're not sure if you can get it for them, then this is your chance. Or even if they would simply really enjoy it, that's good, too. Please tell me your story, and through upvotes and how much my personal heartstrings get tugged, I will make my decision. I will also ship it promptly, so that it can be there on that special morning.

I will ship it anywhere in the US. This was given out of selfless sacrifice and it deserves to be loved, appreciated and enjoyed the way it should have been.

**Rules and FAQ**

To enter, simply comment below which games you want. You are allowed to ask for multiple or all games, but keep it to one post. Please don't ask for a game you already own, and please check the store pages of the games to see if your system can handle the game. When the giveaway end time rolls around, I'm going to use Random.org to pick a winner from the list of comments. Winners will have a Reddit PM sent to them asking for some info so I can send you your game.

**I won X in a previous giveaway and I don't have it yet!** Please PM me. I've finally gotten around to writing down all the winners in one document, and I've come to realize that there a few games in previous giveaways that the previous owners haven't claimed. I'm not sure if it is because people have sent me wrong e-mails and stuff, but it's hard for me to track down, so be sure to find me first!

**Why don't you post your giveaways on other gaming related giveaway subreddits?** Tradition mostly. I started this thing last year here on /r/RandomKindness and I really don't want to bring it somewhere else. I know I'm probably making things worse for the people who are getting annoyed with game requests, so please feel free to send me a message or comment below if you want to discuss it or if you have a good idea.

Anyways, be sure to **upvote** so more people can see (**it's a self post so I don't get karma for it**) and you're also free to **[join my Steam group](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamgamegiveawayweekend)** because I post announcements when the giveaways go live so you don't miss anything!

What I am is a guy who could use some kindness. You see, I'm feeling kinda glum. Back in December, I had surgery and lost my job. Since I worked for a temp agency, they couldn't hold my position. No worries though, I've been getting by on my meager savings and with help from the food shelf. I have a roof over my head, fairly consumable food (though there have been a few weird cans of meat that I may not have been super stoked to eat), and internet access.

So why am I posting? My birthday is in about a week and a half (June 11, to be exact) and I'm feeling pretty lonely. The last few years, my friends have completely forgotten it even with not-so-subtle reminders. Since my family members are deceased, my friends are all I have so it's kind of a bummer. This year most of them are going on a trip and leaving 2 days before my birthday.

At any rate, I would love some birthday wishes. Cards are fun and I can PM my address (and if you'd like, hit you back on YOUR birthday). Even an orangered on my birthday would be cool. And if anyone is feeling super generous, here's my ""I don't really need this stuff, but it looks pretty nifty"" [Amazon wishlist](http://amzn.com/w/2LY2ACJPBYEDI) (not to be confused with my ""Medical supply/home repair/Damn I need a new belt"" list).

Maybe nothing will come of this post, but I figure that I might as well try, instead of feeling sorry for myself. I apologize that this got so long. In my head it sounded *much* shorter.

We managed to get it so we can pay over the course of his treatments and we got some of the price waved because of our financial standing, however that's not our only cost, we have to make trips up to Syracuse on a regular basis because that is the only pediatric neuro in this area, there is also the cost of needles, sterilization equipment, hand sanitizer (the medician suppresses his natural ability to fight off an infection), the increase in hand soap we'll have to get, urine sticks to check for sugar, the list goes on. I am writing this to ask for help, we are already severely financially strained due to my chemo. **she has stage 2 breast cancer**

**UPDATE**
If you don't feel comfortable sending money, these are things the family does need:

Odin's care/medication administration- This goes without saying, we need supplies to help him not catch diseases and to give him his shots. Bandades, cotton balls, alcohol wipes, Enfamil gentle ease formula, bottled water (tap water can carry lots of bacteria that can be very dangerous to anyone with suppressed immune function, we need water to mix formula), Bottles and slow flow nipples (bottles have to be sterilized more often then normal, which means they will break down much quicker), Soothie pacifiers (the medications increase appitie but also cause fluid retention, so we have to control how much he eats to avoid harmful swelling and increased blood pressure, soothies will be our biggest help for that but like bottles they have to be sterlized a lot and will breakdown quickly). 

Cleaning- Just as good hygiene is important, so is a clean and sanitized house. Bleach, Mr. clean cleaner, magic erasers, lysol, window cleaner, fabreeze (preferably pet order), paper towels, disinfecting wipes, orange glow, dish soap (preferably blue dawn so we can use it for the cats baths too), laundry soap, liquid fabric softener, clorix toilet wands, swiffer wet pads, Binghamton city bags.

I know in the grand scheme of things my life isn't so bad, but my last few weeks have been difficult. 

I was rear-ended on the interstate headed home the day before Thanksgiving (11/23). My car is totaled, but the other person's car insurance is refusing to pay for front end damages so I'm out my deductible ($1,000) until my insurance company can recover cost from their insurance company and it looks like it's going to go to arbitration (3rd party working to resolve the differences between my insurance company and the other drivers). 

I got laid off last Tuesday (11/29). Immediate loss of health insurance and income. Also, affected the car situation (lack of deductible, etc) Didn't see it coming either. 

Finally my mom went through a severe case of pancreatitis that started September 21st and led to a one and a half month hospital stay where her kidneys were only functioning at about 8%. She had to go through 3 rounds dialysis and came very close to death  (lungs, intestines and other organs also started shutting down). The last few weeks she's been in recovery and she just had her follow up appointment this past Friday (12/2). It turns out there are two large cysts on her pancreas which need to be taken out before they get infected or abscess.

Reddit, I'm exhausted. These last two weeks have been really hard and I haven't talked to anyone really because I've been feeling so down (and that's putting in lightly) I could use some random kindness my way.

I had previously bought a used copy of this book from one of the top sellers on Amazon but I just found out they never sent it, so they just refunded me.

The reason why I'm not personally buying it, is because I will not be able to do another transaction with my credit card outside Argentina until the end of the month(due to new economic restrictions imposed by our lovely goverment), and this relative of mine is coming down here next monday... and the only way of paying I have left is through my paypal balance (i have around 100usd i received from a couple of websites for doing small jobs).

In total it should be around 50usd I believe... i'll pay you back with paypal.com, the one thing im not sure its how to do the transaction safe... ill guess ill have to trust your kindness :)

PS: one seller is offering the hardcover version for around 29usd and offers 1 and 2 day shipping. So i might ask you for that instead of the new one... although im scared im going to get screwed again. oh well im running out of options anyway

The cat had been there for a few days, yowling, but he assumed it was in heat and didn't check until today (I know...). Both back legs are injured, and one definitely needs to be amputated, if not both. Otherwise the cat if perfectly happy and healthy and can live a long life still, but if no one can pay for the surgery the cat will be euthanized.

We really, REALLY want to save this cat, but don't have the funds to do so (they may or may not be the brother/sister of two stray kittens that we took in a month ago, so this really hits home for us). We have the means for ongoing care, but cannot shell out the $1000+ to get her legs fixed right now. Right now, the cat is at the VCA Southeast Portland Animal Clinic (503-255-8139) if you want to call and ask about a black stray that was brought in around 11:00am this morning for confirmation of my story.

If you know of any resources that can help us get this sweet cat healthy and home with us, or have any ideas of best courses of action (should I set up a fund for donations? I don't know), my husband and I would be eternally grateful.

Thank you so much for reading this.

Edit:  Good news!  He was tranfserred from the local vet to the county animal shelter. They are going to get him in tip top shape and, as long as no one else claims him, we can adopt him for the normal adoption fee!  We are so happy and excited.

This is my first request, and it may not get any takers but I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask since I need some help. I have recently packed up my entire life into two boxes and taken a plane 3,000 miles away to live in Alaska in order to get away from a very negative home-life. As exciting as this is, this is my first time really being **on my own** and out of the state I spent my whole life in. 

Currently I am renting a basement of a house in Anchorage, but am still living out of those two boxes and with one small blanket to help me get through the winter on a futon. If anyone could spare anything to make this more home-like, such as a used blanket or even some of those plastic storage shelves to help me get my clothes out of the boxes, that would be amazing. I'm really left strapped for cash while trying to support my boyfriend and I with my job.

I'd be so thankful if anyone had anything lying around that they could spare. I can't tell you how much it would mean to me. As always, I will definitely pay it forward.

In case it's not abundantly obvious, I'm doing this early so I have time to pick someone, prep, and ship, in time for the festivities.

Today is my best friend's birthday. He called me in tears this morning about how horrible his birthday has been going so far. He is the classic gentlemen and nice guy, and part of him being a nice guy is buying his ""best friend"", a girl he is in love with, everything she wants from $300 jackets and birthday presents for her family. He even went as far as giving her his car when her car died, and has been even paying the gas. They were supposed to hang-out today, until she told him she was broke and cannot afford to go do anything. He was disappointed, because this is the 3rd time she's done this in a 2 week span. In reality, we found out she took his car a state over with a bunch of friends. The car he has been using is in service, his bank account has run dry, and nobody will come visit him. It crushes me to see my best friend like this, and I would go see him if I could. Can Reddit help cheer him up on his cake day? He is a Redditor on the west coast of the USA.

Any happy birthday wishes or good vibes are appreciated.",thedarkestone1,37,13,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/1g64kc/request_the_last_few_weeks_have_been_pretty/,"EDIT: I just wanted to say a huge thank you to everyone who's been so supportive and loving so far, giving me well-wishes and getting me some very thoughtful gifts off of my wishlist. It really means the world to me! I was having another truly bad day today (the driver's side door of my car decided to short out today, so that was a big pain) and when I got home and saw all of this is made my day 100x better, thank you all so much! &lt;3 :)

The last couple months have been very rough on my husband and I. Right before I went down south for a week to visit my grandparents, my husband contracted a MRSA infection in his leg that had to be surgically removed (they tried treating it with medication first, but it ended up rupturing one day while he was at work). Ever since then, his health insurance has been badgering us and either refusing to cover stuff that they have to, or giving us total and complete hell with the run around that they've given us.

To make matters worse, my own health has been going downhill in the last few weeks. I started having horrible back pain in my lower right quadrant that steadily combined with bouts of nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. My doctor thought at first that it was a sprained back muscle (I lift boxes frequently at my part-time job) and prescribed me with extra strength ibuprofen and a muscle relaxer. It did nothing and the pain got so bad one night that I had to literally stay awake resisting the urge to go to the ER because we're already in debt to the hospital. Ended up going in for a sick day appointment. The doctor I saw then thought it might be a kidney stone was passing and prescribed me Oxycodone and had me urinate into a funnel for a week. Week later and there was still pain and no stones, so they have me go through a pelvic CT scan, even though I'm cringing when the bill for it will come along.

Found our yesterday that they found inflammation and fatty deposits around my colon/large intestine (the fatty deposits mean that there's been past inflammation). This is a bad sign that I'm developing Crohn's Disease, which is present on both sides of my family, though distantly. 

So on my birthday on the 25th, I have to find the money for gas to drive two hours round trip to a gastroenterologist to talk to him about what's going on, and arrange for a colonoscopy so they can see what's going on inside of me and diagnose from there. My husband already talked to his insurance, and they're vague at most if any of this will be covered. Even if we can pay down the debts slowly, it's been a terrible depression on me, since we had only just finally gotten past bills and debts taken care of. 

Past birthdays have sucked, but this year with the expensive doctor visit and such poor health prospects, my spirit is pretty shattered. Things were finally starting to look up for us before all this happened. We were starting to save for a small house to get out of this crappy little apartment and saving airfare for a trip next year slowly. Now we're so far behind I don't know what we're going to do.

I'm honestly not sure what I'm requesting other then some well wishing and knowing that someone out there cares. These problems have been weighing so heavily on my mind, and now I know whatever scraps of money I'll get for my birthday will probably go to pay for bills. I've bought nearly nothing for myself the past two years I've been married, and this has just added salt to the injury.

I did make an amazon wishlist for my birthday because a friend was thinking of getting me something and then bowed out from doing so, but admittedly, I'm afraid if I post it here I'll just get downvoted to all hell (that is, if I won't already for the post alone). I'll just put it here in case anyone feels nice enough to have a look and get me something, though I don't expect it. I know how financial hard times are. Most of it's just small geeky things I wouldn't mind (I'm a total nerd): http://amzn.com/w/32JOAMIP3OC9O

[Here is Derpy and me in the car](http://i.imgur.com/3fNWSD2.jpg)

Hey, fellow redditors! My dog and I are in a pretty terrible situation and could really use your help. I hate asking people for things, but I've seen many wonderful things happen here before and have been urged by others to post Derpy's story to reddit. In order to truly explain what is going on, I wrote up a long and very sad story (which you can read [here](http://savederpy.blogspot.com/)). She has health issues that are fatal if not fixed through surgery, but, with surgery she will be as healthy as any other dog and able to live the long, healthy life that she deserves. 

I rescued Derpy a little over a year ago [from neglect and abuse], and she has had health issues throughout this time. She has been diagnosed with a congenital liver shunt. It is unknown at the time whether the shunt is intra- or extrahepatic. I was told by my veterinarian that there was no cure for this and that the only option was to give her prescription food and liver support supplements to delay the day that she'd start having serious complications and would need to be put to sleep.

Recently, I moved from New Orleans, Louisiana to Asheville, North Carolina with my boyfriend. First, I stayed with him in Tennessee for about a month while he finished work out there before moving to nearby Asheville. At the place in Tennessee, pets were not allowed and I trusted my old roommate in New Orleans, a friend of 9 years, to watch her until I could go get her. He decided he could no longer watch her for me and gave me two days notice before he was going to abandon her. It was through this misfortune that she wound up boarding at a different veterinary facility, until transportation could be found for her. There we found out that my, “Friend,” had actually been severely neglecting her and she now also had bladder stones. After having a new veterinarian look over her records and treat her, I was informed that there was a surgery that could correct congenital liver shunts in dogs that we could possibly have done when she has the surgery to remove the stones.

This is where I need help. I can't afford the surgery that she needs. I've already paid around $3,500 in veterinary expenses at a place where they did not cure my dog or even give me the correct information regarding her diagnosis and treatment. For the time being, she is not in any pain and we have a few weeks to come up with the funds for her treatment. It's still a serious, pressing matter, that needs to be resolved as soon as possible. Within a day or two, scans of some of the important, original paperwork from her vet records as well as paperwork I'll be getting from a consult about her surgery I have set up Thursday morning will be uploaded to the website to help support the legitimacy of the claims I have made here and in her [story](http://savederpy.blogspot.com/).

Any way that anyone can help me out would be very greatly appreciated. Maybe you own a business in the Asheville, North Carolina area or know someone that does that would be willing to let me put up a donation jar for Derpy and/or allow me to hold bake sales there to raise money. Maybe you or someone you know has some leftover hepatic food (L/D or similar) or hepatic supplements that aid in filtering toxins (Hepato or similar) that you would be willing to donate, which would help with saving money for the surgery. I've been looking into different charitable websites that are designed to help people in situations like these and am working with a rescue organization to help raise the money, but would love to be pointed in the direction of any additional resources, especially any that wouldn't have a long wait/application processing period--want to get this done as soon as possible before she starts feeling pain from the bladder stones. I've never been in an emergency situation like this and could use any sort of support and guidance I could get. Maybe you've been in a similar situation and have a success story you could share with me that could help give me more direction and some hope. I feel like I'm doing everything I can and at the same time I feel as though I am doing nowhere near enough. I could really even just use someone older and more experienced with life to be able to talk to for advice and encouragement. (I'm 24, have no immediate family, and only a few close friends around my age to talk to, most of which live halfway across the country and have been too busy with their own problems to talk to me lately.)

Thank you so much for your time and consideration. Please help in any way to prevent me from having to give my dog away after all I have already done and gone through for her—if I'd even be able to find someone to take her and pay for all of her treatment. Her life before we got her was a very sad one, filled with abuse and neglect. She is an amazing dog that deserves to live a long, happy, healthy life. Despite everything she has been through, she is still the sweetest dog that wants nothing but to be good and loving. My relationship with her is incredibly important to both of us and I have learned so much about love and life through my experiences with my Derpy. I consider myself to be incredibly lucky that Derpy is the dog I wound up getting out of many different choices of dogs, despite her medical issues, because she is the most amazing dog I have ever met and she has made a serious impact in my life and the lives of others around her.

tl;dr I have a sick dog that needs help getting a life-saving surgery. For a more detailed story on Derpy, go to her website [here](http://savederpy.blogspot.com).

""I was the pleasantly surprised victim of a random act of kindness tonight...I took the kids out to eat to the Cracker Barrel on 53 in Braselton. After we finished eating, we were browsing around the cute little shop area that they love to browse. As they were playing with some of the toys on display, one of the employees approached me holding a giant pink stuffed teddy bear. She asked, ""Would your girls like a bear?"" I wondered for a minute if it was some charity fundraiser or breast cancer awareness type thing. As I went to answer her, an elderly man, at least in his 80's-90's approached us. ""Would your girls like a bear?"" I said ""Well, sure, what's it for?"" The employee at Cracker Barrel smiled, she knew. Another Cracker Barrel employee walked up to me as they were handing Cali and Zoe the bears and told me that last year his wife passed away, and that he comes in all the time just to purchase items for children because it made him happy. As she tells me this, he also notices Zoe playing with a doll that she just won't let go. He in turn returns to the cash register to purchase her the doll as well. It was such a sincere act of kindness. I plan to randomly return the favor and pass it on, I am not sure how or when but certainly the opportunity will present itself. I hope that if you read this, you will also feel compelled to make someone's day. It was such an experience.""

Instead of using this card myself, I want to pass it on to a fellow Redditor in need. 

I recently gave in RAOP, and will be doing similar ""background checks"" on user's to make sure that the most deserving person wins. If you'd like to see how I handled my previous give away, [please see here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/p9wqr/offer_free_pizza_to_a_single_parent_and_kids/). I know there are scammers out there, so don't even try if you don't have much history on the site.

All I ask in return is validation in the form of a reply below or a thanks thread, that you received and were able to use the $20. This is simply to help verify my future offers to other Redditors down the road.

If you're interested in the free $20, please reply below letting me know what you intend to spend it on and why. I will pick one of them by 9:00PM CST today, 2012-02-15 for delivery via private message.

Share as little or as much information as you'd like, just know that I take choosing seriously so the more info you can share the better your chances at being chosen. I am looking for Redditors in need, not Redditors who want another game on Steam.

**TL;DR - Free $20 AMEX card, reply with what you'd use the money on and why.**

NOTE: The card says ""accepted virtually everywhere AMEX cards are welcome in the US,"" so sadly this if for US residents only.

**EDIT 1 2012-02-15 (19:31 CST):** Wow guys, I didn't expect this many deserving responses. There is simply no way I could choose without feeling like an ass, so what I will end up doing is assigning a number based on your response order, and then using [random.org](http://www.random.org/) to choose. I will be drawing in 90 minutes.

**EDIT 2 2012-02-15 (20:37 CST):** Just about 20 minutes away from the drawing for the winner of the $20. I've given away a few other gifts to requests that struck a cord with me. Please don't judge, I just couldn't pass up those requests. Everyone else still has a shot at the $20 via random.org. THANKS!

( Now with testimonials! )",RHAINUR,32,7,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/p8xt7/offerwww_i_will_teach_you_htmljavascript_phpmysql/,"I am a computer nerd who loves teaching. I have experience in many sub-fields of the vast *thing* known as ""IT"", but I am particularly experienced with the items mentioned in the title. 

Regarding web design/development: I will teach you even if you have no prior experience at all in web design/development, and have never programmed before.

Regarding programming: I have worked with quite a few programming languages, but the ones I'm most familiar with are Java, C++, C# and (for web) PHP/Javascript. If you're a beginner or have never programmed before, I can help you with all of these. Even if you're working with another language and are struggling on some basic concepts, chances are I can help you. If you're an intermediate programmer, then I assume you can pretty much Google everything you need anyway. Please don't contact me if you want to learn a significant amount of any language other than PHP. I consider myself qualified to help you with the basics, but I don't use those languages enough to be an ""expert"" programmer.

Regarding Photoshop: I went through a rather bad episode of depression about 2 years back and deleted/destroyed all my digital art + backups, but some of my recent stuff can be seen [here](http://elasticlogic.deviantart.com). I may not be the best artist/designer around, but if you're a photographer who wants to learn how to do some post-processing to improve their work or someone who wants to learn the basic tools in Photoshop,then I can help you out.

**Requirements:** 

* You need to have Skype (it's a free download and free account creation), a microphone, and a decent internet connection. Time zones may be an issue ( I live in the Middle East ), but I frequently chat with friends in the US, and getting up a little early or staying up a little late isn't a problem for me. I'm sure we can work something out.

* You need to speak decent English. I'm not asking for a BA in English Literature, but teaching, ESPECIALLY when it's computer related, will be much easier if we can understand each other easily.

* You need to be motivated enough to practice a little on your own. The learning process will go a lot better if, for every hour that i teach you, you spend an hour practicing on your own, just messing around with stuff. Honestly, the vast majority of *good* IT professionals got their start by fiddling around with their computer despite not knowing what might happen.

* You have to WANT to LEARN: I have 32 ""students"" on my contact list, all of whom found me via my post on Reddit. About 7-8 of them never even bothered messaging me after the initial add request. Another 8-10 haven't set up a class, even though it's been over 2 weeks. Some of them have given me reasons, and that's fine, but others simply never come online. I would think they didn't like my teaching, except I haven't even *taught them yet*. Please make sure you really want to learn and stay the course. :)

**If you're interested, post here for the record, and send me a PM with your Skype ID and a rough idea of what you want to learn. I shall add you asap and we can discuss timings and what not then**.

Please don't ask me if I have room for more! Just post here and send me a PM with your Skype name. I will do my best to find time for you! I have people spread across a bunch of different time zones, and most of them are busy with work too, so until I get a few dozen students, you're sure to get a slot.

I do not represent an organization.  Anyway, here is a poorly written brief story:

My neighbor was in the army.  He told me that his wife left him when he was actively serving.  He moved back to Iowa when he was discharged and gained custody of his daughter.  His wife was using substances and didn't put up a fight.  He works two jobs (U.S. Cellular is his day job, I don't know the night job) and I always run into him when we're waiting for the elevator on my floor.  

I just bought a new flat screen tv for black friday on amazon.com.  My old livingroom tv was too big for my bedroom and I wanted to get rid of it.  Today, I asked him if he wanted it for free and he gladly agreed.  It was a pretty heavy tv (36"" tube-style set) so we moved it to his place.  

There were a bunch of toys on the floor (his daughter is around 2) and two inflatable mattresses.  There was no furniture and they were eating off of paper plates.  It was sad to me.  He's a very hardworking and decent person, and I think the world needs to cut the guy a break.  

I've got about $200 of my own to work with.  If anyone would be willing to buy things online (comforters, bed frames, pillows, sheets, some light furniture) I think it would be amazing.  Will provide verification, proof, etc.  

Thanks for reading.

Edit:  I hope I followed the posting guidelines correctly.  This is a complicated system compared to r/NFL and r/trees.

Edit No. 2:  I have created a paypal.  Message me if you're interested in donating small amounts of money.  Receipts will be scanned and uploaded so you can see what your donations are contributing to.

Final Edit:  I contacted the local Unitarian Universalist Church and they are going to provide assistance.  I also received my holiday bonus (I forgot that I get one) and will be able to cover the differences in price.

The bunnies in question are these [three](http://imgur.com/a/4wiru) right here. They are from a batch of seven hand sewn bunnies I had done for an .... odd... school project. I am now down to three small ones and thought that they, too, should go to interesting homes. Like I have said they are hand sewn so they are not the most durable plushes around.

Now to acquire one all I ask is for a cute or funny description/tale of who one of these bunnies will become friends with. Will it be one of your friends, yourself, or even a toaster?  No sob stories please.

I will see who these bunnies shall go to in 12hrs (10pm central time). :)

In August a woman I know called me up to say that her friend had a rental house that needed to be cleaned out and that I could take whatever I wanted. I took about 20 boxes of books out of that place. And since I've made about $2,500.00 off of those books. Even sold one that went for $800.00.

I had a nurse tell me about this community a couple weeks back when I was taking my son to the hospital, and I figured I'd take a look around.  What I saw blew my mind.  I had no idea there were still kind and generous people left in the world, and to the extent that I saw on here made me well up a little bit.

I'm in a tough spot, and figured I'd post on here and see what comes of it.  My son, Michael, is 6 years old, and he has a pretty severe form of Aspergers.  He's an amazing kid, smarter than I'll ever be, but like most children with Aspergers, he has troubles interacting with other children.

We've started going to a child psychologist recently, but it's about a 45 minute drive there and back, and he gets very restless on the ride.  My neighbor has an iPad, and my son loves playing with it when he gets the chance, but that's well out of our price range.

When the HP Touchpad firesale came along, we tried to purchase one for him, but had massive issues with Amazon, PCMall, Barnes &amp; Noble, Staples &amp; Office Depot, all who refused to process the order, stating they ""oversold"".

I know this is a very bold request, and I know the odds probably aren't in my favor, but if by any chance someone on here happened to purchase a Touchpad at the reduced price, and weren't happy with it, or just aren't using it anymore, and wanted to help out our family, we would be indebted to you forever.

However, now he is spending the rest of his probation term in prison, with very few people to write to. His brother an I are sending him money, stamps, books, and everything else he could possibly need, so this is not a plea for someone to help support him, as we support him fully financially.

To answer a question that I know will be asked, he is on probation because 6 years ago, he came home to find his wife (same woman as above) in his bed having sex with another man, while his infant daughter was laying in the other room. Being young and enraged at the situation, he attacked the guy and hurt him pretty badly. The guy did live, fully recovered, and is fine. 

I did post this over in r/penpals, but did not get much of a response, and since he is in Florida I am not allowed to officially post an ad for him. I am hoping that some of you can find it in your heart to write to Sam, and help make his existence in prison a little less lonely. 

His myspace page : http://www.myspace.com/samjackson01

I am sure he would prefer to write to females, but I think just getting your name called for mail call would make him just as happy.

I'm a professional webdeveloper (not a designer!) and my experience:

*    PHP 4, 5
*    JavaScript &amp; several JS Libraries(jQuery, Prototype, Mootools)
*    AJAX (mostly using jQuery for it)
*    MySQL 4  &amp; 5
*    Regular Expressions (tastes: POSIX, PERL, JavaScript)
*    Apache webservers, a bit IIS &amp; nginx
*    Database Design (drawing ERD‘s , usually normalised to Boyce-Codd)
*    XML, XSD, &amp; XSLT
*    WebServices(SOAP, REST)
*    CSS2, 3
*    Browser-glitches (IE, FF,  Chrome, Safari)
*    Perl
*    Python
*    Several Security issues(SQL-injection, XSS, XSRF, Session-Hijacking, directory-traversal, etc), and how to prevent abuse (Tarpits, SSL/TSL, faked flaws, hashing, encryption, parity encoding(like Hamming), input validation, etc).
* openSSL

Rules:

* Strictly non-profit. No selling, no encouraging to buy product X. A portfolio is ok, I just don't want to work for free if some company is making money of it.
* Charity websites are a yay. However, I don't want to have it a religious or political aspect. So: sorry Salvation Army or punchglennbeckinthemouth.com .
* 8 hours. It's not much, so:


NO: Could ya fix me a website? Could you fix me a webshop? Could you write me mailbomber? ** I could but I won't!**


YES: I want feed x, Could you help me install Wordpress with a widget that does X? I want to scrape some info from site x. I want to plot a nifty graph for this dataset. I want a fancy mousetrailer! (Ehh.. scrap that last one...) etc.


* I will release the code copylefted as [GPLv3](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

It has been a lot of fun, but in no way do we have enough money or time for care packages, letters, etc, for all 140 dudes (and gals) over there!  It is in Pasab, so dusty, hot and probably pretty damn lonely there!

We have sent a few packages, postcards, letters and my two year old has sent a few pictures he colored.  We really have tried to send a little something each week. 

I have tried to get friends, family, facebook friends, etc, involved but no one is really interested. My oldest did have his class write letters and someone here in RK sent them some Girl Scout cookies. 

So far the platoon leader and another guy have written back to my son and sent him some post cards, which absolutely thrilled him. 

They sound like really nice guys!  I thought some on Reddit may be interested in writing them, sending a post card, sending a care package or something. 

PM for the address if interested!  Sending a letter or shipping items (if you ship a package you will need to fill out a customs form, FYI, and the Post Office will help you with it) is the same price as it would be in the US, even though it is going to Afghanistan. So shipping isn't too bad, especially if you use those flat rate boxes.

A Message From the Platoon Commander
Deployed From: Fort Bliss, TX 

Comments: I want to start off by saying thank you for your support. I am a platoon leader on a small COP in southern Afghanistan. I am hoping that this program will allow me to give my guys some items that we cannot find here. 

We are always in need of baby wipes, foot powder and tooth paste. Hard candy is a great way for us to interact with local children. 

Pencils and paper have proven to be worth their weight in gold while on patrol. Children will often tell us about IEDs in exchange for a pencil and a few sheets of paper. 

My Soldiers could also use any kind of entertainment, I.e.footballs, CDs, DVDs, board games, ps3/Xbox360/ playstation Vita games, music, books, magazines (fitness, outdoors, guns). 

Letters from people stateside are just as important as any item. We all appreciate having someone write us. Thank you. 

****ADMIN NOTE****We can tell by the address that this Soldier is in a remote part of Afghan. Keep sending those weekly letters through the mail. If you have a work group, church, lots of friends and family your Soldier and his/her unit could use all the support you can offer.

Now here is where your help would be much appreciated! He has informed us that he will take on 3 students that can ace the final. Basically the final is to use everything that we've learned and make ourselves unrecognizable. That means i need to look like someone completely different so i might have a chance at becoming an assistant.

:( So please if any of you have wigs/clothes/jewelry that you can part with can i please have them? I'll take good care of them and use them all the time since i'll be doing costume make up. This could be the kickstart and the foot in the door for my career and I'd really appreciate it. The clothes can be torn, flithy, stained, anything! I'll make it work someone. Please let me know and I swear on my life I'll try to find a way to repay you. Thanks for reading!

I can fit in the sizes medium, large, and extra large. Male clothing would be fine. Again thanks for reading and if you can send me something i freaking LOVE you

I'll make you a song, just for you. No one else would have it, and it wouldn't be a bad one, either. It could be just acoustic guitar, it could be almost like dubstep, a mix of both, you won't know until you get it. 

All I want is for you to tell me a story. Something that happened to you recently, or about your love life, or a poem, about how shitty your week has been, a letter to someone that will never read it, or an original story you wrote. Anything with emotion.
And that is what the song will be made from. I make songs based on feeling, and whatever feeling that the story gives me, I will make the song like it.

I might pick one winner, or everyone, or a few, depending on how much activity this gets.

His boat washed up onshore without him in Michoacan.

[Article](http://www.latitude38.com/lectronic/lectronicday.lasso?date=2012-03-02#.UPs5OKFFf5H)

His boat randomly happened to wash up without him in a town I had spent most of several years in years ago. I now live in Oaxaca. It was super heavy. I drove straight up to Zihuataneho when I found out and met his 80 year old father. I spent a couple weeks trying to coordinate the investigation between three states (Colima, Michoacan, Guerrero). The actual town is a super heavy narco zone and even going there was risky, especially because everybody there knows my name and where I live now. (Its a surf town that was chill but has gotten sketchy). I have two local friends that were killed there as well. It's a long story and if people are really interested I will get into more of it. Basically I did everything I could until I was just way to sketched out and had to bail.

A year has passed and he never turned up. The Memorial is in Telluride, Colorado Feb 23. I would need to fly from Oaxaca City to Telluride and back. I feel funny asking because I'm not very bad off really. I am starting a business and renting a decent place etc.. I just don't have any extra money. No way at all I could swing it. We are barely affording diapers at the end of every month. My wife is Mexican and has no visa to travel so it would just be me. Crushed to miss it.

I am using my friend [Kitios](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ncujd/offercontest_last_person_to_post_wins_a_15_gift/) idea. Lets have some fun and get presents!

**Here are the rules**:

* Make a comment to this post.

* Have no one else comment after you for 2 hours.

* Every time someone comments, the 2 hour 1 hour timer restarts.

* There is an end time I am not announcing to this contest and person closest to that wins if no one hits the 2 hour 1 hour time limit.

* You can post as many times as you see fit.

The winner will be receiving a Visa gift card in the mail, ordered from [Walmart](http://www.walmart.com/ip/Visa-100-Gift-Card/16513386). I will rush deliver so you can spend in time for the holidays. I will do this again next Saturday on Christmas Eve, but you won't get the card until probably the 27^th, so if you're looking for money for presents, now is the time to act!.",,False,self,t5_2szh3,False,,,True,t3_ngxp4,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/ngxp4/offercontest_last_person_to_post_wins_a_50_visa/,

I'm not asking for anything tangible, unless you are willing to do so.
Just, on November 30th, I would like people to wish her a Happy Birthday and let her know that things will always get better. She is a redditor and whether you would like to send her a card, or just make a quick message on the 30th via reddit would make her day! I want to flood her inbox with those kinds of messages.

She has been a really good friend to me and I want to show her that life isn't all bad, and there are good people out there who wish the best for everyone. She needs to see the good in humanity, I believe you all can show her that on her special day.

PM me for either the Reddit username or the address to our apartment if you would like to send her a birthday card.

Thank you all for taking the time to read this.
I will pay this forward.
Have a wonderful day RK

Edit: She totally hinted on Facebook what she would like. She still doesn't know about this RK post.

I'll also take requests and even write anonymous messages to someone you want to make happy (like the snailmailmyemail.org project!), for just $2 or a small donation to my bills-fund. You could send me a couple of lines, I'll write it (or draw it, whatever you want) and send it to whoever you want. Who doesn't love a surprise in the mail?


I feel bad asking for help, so I'd like to do it this way. It's coming all the way from Belgium, so you'd get something exotic!


Let me know if anyone is interested. I will definitely send you proof of what I'm sending (a photo of the envelope ready to be sent out) Thank you! :)

It's that time again and a new Humble Bundle has come out! It's very exciting especially since this one is spectacular. I'd just like to set a few ground rules:

*You may gift the humble bundle to someone requesting it, and you may buy one to offer as a gift; however, you may not share your URL code with everyone as an ""OFFER"" while you redeem them on steam. This is a charity people! I don't want to see people going around and offering to give the downloads to people free of charge as they have already taken the steam keys. That is just disgusting behavior to me.

That being said, if I notice that you are offering just the downloads, or just posting the URL, I will immediately delete your thread. No questions asked, no warning.

This is a great cause and I hope a lot of people come out to support it, but I hope that the good people of this subreddit are above stealing from a charity.

**What it is and what it isn’t**

This isn’t a set diet or exercise routine. This isn’t a competition with prizes. This is a group of people working together to better themselves. Whether you want to change a lot or a little, gain muscle or lose weight, everyone is welcome. More than anything else, this group will provide you with a place to talk to other people about health and fitness in a completely open and friendly environment. No question is too basic here.

**What’s the format?**

* First step, [fill out this form to sign up for Round 6](http://goo.gl/cw46B). All information is kept private. The information is used to provide group statistics. Individual progress is released at the middle and end of the round using a display name of your choosing.

* Second step, subscribe to [r/90daysgoal](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal) and start participating. Introduce yourself in the [Round 6 intro thread](http://redd.it/o4feo). Ask any questions you might have or answer any questions that you’re knowledgeable about. Post your goals or read through other people’s routines in the [dailygoal threads](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal/search?q=dailygoal&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on). 

**TLDR; If you’re interested, [sign up](http://goo.gl/cw46B) and subscribe to [r/90daysgoal](http://www.reddit.com/r/90daysgoal). Day 1 is January 9th. There will be informational posts throughout the first couple weeks to get everyone started toward their goals. Day 90 will be April 7th. I hope we’ll all have something to celebrate in three months!**",,False,self,t5_2szh3,False,,S1,True,t3_o5hvz,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/o5hvz/offerwwwshameless_promo_we_will_help_you_get_your/,moderator

1375134580.0,21,self.RandomKindness,1jb0f0,[RK] The results of our RandomKindness video game post survey,Avien,24,3,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/1jb0f0/rk_the_results_of_our_randomkindness_video_game/,"Over the year we've had a vocal few express some contempt for video game related requests and offers. 

We the Moderators have generally allowed such posts but have left it up to the community to vote, report, and/or respond to such posts. What this has created however is a sort of 'grey area' in regards to the rules. 

Some video game offers and requests are accepted and therefore encourage more requests and more offers, which some view as clutter/spam. Some posts are downvoted and/or reported which may be unwarranted since technically they aren't against the rules.

I tried some months back to create a poll that would gauge how the community felt about video games. Unfortunately there was very little response, and the two sides that did respond to the issue were split almost 50/50. So in the end I just decided to keep things the way they were.

Last week I received a couple more messages that were complaining of a recent influx in the number of video game requests. So yet again I decided to try to poll the community and see what you guys and gals think.

---
**The Results:**

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1aIl_ogODj5WYa4smmzQ6ZFrF1vCn7P4UfXPZDZD_ODQ/viewanalytics

---
**Analysis:**

**Question 1:** Should we allow video game Requests on RandomKindness?

**Answer:** Divided. Yet again the community is unable to come to a overwhelming consensus about video game requests. 70 people think they shouldn't be allowed and 67 people think they should. A three person difference is not statistically sound enough to make a rule that video game requests can't be allowed on RK.

**Question 2:** Should RK allow video game related OFFERS on RandomKindness?

**Answer:** A resounding 'yes'! 72% of the community believes we should allow video game offers.

**Question 3:** Do you think Steam offers/requests are negatively affecting the subreddit?

**Answer:** Apparently not. I asked this question because I wanted to see if the community had an issue with video games or just the Steam game platform since most game requests/offers on RK tend to be Steam related. 

**Question 4:** Do you think all video game offers &amp; requests are negatively affecting the subreddit

**Answer:** Definitely not.

**Question 5:** Why do think video game requests are hurting this subreddit?

**Answer:** I'm not very happy with this question. It was a pointed question and I don't think the 'check all that apply' option was the best way of answering it, let alone the answers themselves which may not be fair. Regardless, 1/3 of the respondents believe that at the very least video game posts aren't hurting the subreddit.

Those that do feel like video games adversely effect this subreddit have a variety of opinions:

* Video game posts create clutter or spam the subreddit
* They're so common that the giving of a game doesn't seem like a 'kind act' anymore
* Many scammers like to request Steam games and RK is not adapt at preventing this, though many other subreddits are
* /r/playitforward , /r/GiftofGames , /r/RandomActsOfGaming exist for video game requests/offers and are better able to prevent their members from getting scammed
* Physical copies of games should be allowed while digital copies should not
* Video game requests sound immature, like a child begging for a game his parents won't buy for him

**Question 6:** Should RK allow requests &amp; offers for video game related peripherals?

**Answer:** Definitely yes.

**Question 7:** Did this survey do a good job at representing how you feel about video game posts on RandomKindness?

**Answer:** Yes it did. I was hoping that if I was to make a Mod judgement based on the opinions of the community, most people who answered the survey would agree that it was a good and that I wasn't leaving anything out or was biased in any way.

---

**Conclusions:**

I don't think anything should change, yet. The only thing that members can't agree on is allowing video game requests to continue which has been the problem from the very start.

Many members feel that these requests are bogging down the subreddit and I don't think they're wrong. 

The point that was brought up about RK being unable to handle video game scammers is completely valid. That is why the other subreddits mentioned above are much better for these sort of requests, since you know with more certainty that your kind acts are being appreciated by honest people.

I think that for time being, members who don't like video game requests should direct them via comment to our friends in the sidebar: /r/playitforward , /r/GiftofGames , and /r/RandomActsOfGaming 

Those who want to offer games on RK should continue to do so.

Otherwise, feel free to comment and discuss the results of the survey or direct any questions or opinions you have at the Mods.

Please read.",OpinionatedSouthern,27,5,41,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/13x9wa/request_us_ms_help_me_give_my_husband_the_best/,"So, my husband and I have hit some hard times this past year. He was promoted right as I was laid off, so we thought things were going to be just fine. He then got demoted, and things aren't fine. We'll make it by digging into our savings and floating by until we can make it to the Spring, sell our house, and move closer to my parents so they can watch my boys while I go back to school and work. But, I digress.

  What I need from you Reddit is some help with my husband's Christmas. When he got promoted, we decided to sponsor an orphaned Christmas child from the local orphanage. Even with the demotion, we decided to give him the best Christmas we could, and we did. Our budget for each other this year is only 10.00 each, and the goal is to stretch it as far as we can. We're not allowed to sell any belongings or anything like that. 10 bucks. He's a fantastic husband and father, and I'd love to be able to surprise him and go all out. [Here is a picture of his good ole' name badge, with the pictures of both of our boys.](http://imgur.com/Ov8De)

  What I need from you Reddit is anything you might have that he might like. Used and/or handmade is absolutely perfect. I can spot you a couple of bucks via PayPal for shipping. If it happens to be a book or an older used game, media mail is very, very cheap.

  A little bit about him: He works a lot, but in his free time he loves to fish. He loves zombies. Walking Dead, especially. He plays video games (Xbox- mostly RPG's and FPS) and a few computer games (Tibia and Rebirth RO come to mind). He collects knives, swords, and dragony things (midieval type). Actually, he recently sold most of his swords to pay bills, so mostly knives and dragons now. He likes DVDs and will watch any random, old movie there is. He doesn't read much anymore, but enjoys R.A. Salvatore. Heck, he'd even enjoy Christmas cards or post cards. I'd love to be able to stuff a stocking with Christmas cards from around the US (or further!).

  **TL;DR: Trying to give husband a great Christmas for 10.00. Please help by sending used, unwanted items, or even Christmas cards! Thanks in advance, Reddit.**

  **Edited to add: I've gotten about 4 offers of cards, and I think that's a super cool idea. Canada, Finland, and a couple in the US.

To shorten it, my dad passed away a couple years ago and most of the money in his will was to go to me for college. I have a large family that has always fought, and my mother is very bad with money, so I never got any of it, except for some savings bonds he bought for me when I was a baby.




Since he's been gone my family has pretty much dropped me from their lives (they hated my dad, and as a result resented me since I was a kid, and I suppose now they feel they don't have to pretend to like me anyone) so there's no way I could get financial help from them. My mom has since remarried and my stepdad has made it clear that he wants me out of the picture so she can move on with her life. He makes a good 170k a year, and even after I swallowed my pride and asked for help, he made it clear that I was on my own.



So I moved across the country to Arizona to live with my boyfriend and start school, but we're living in someone else's house in the process of being sold and we could be homeless at any moment. I'm working at a toy store as much as possible to save up for an apartment, while going to classes and trying to do the best I can.



I have literally no money for textbooks. Financial Aid is barely covering tuition because I am an out of state student. I've tried applying for scholarships but I've been out of luck, and I really don't want to go down the road of taking out a lot of loans. All of my money from working is going towards food and saving up for a home before we're kicked out. If anyone has any of these books and isn't using them, I would be happy to send them back when the summer/fall semesters are over! If it's necessary I'll try to scrape up the money for postage for you to send them as well.



I'm an art major, so anyone that is kind enough to help me will get free artwork! **Here's some of my [stuff](http://meltingflowers.tumblr.com/tagged/emily%20casalena).**



I would appreciate any help so so much, although I don't expect much with much more dire situations in this subreddit than a broke student in need of books.



**TL;DR I'm a broke college student and would give you my undying love for some textbooks.**



**I don't want anyone's money, just some help with books! You have no idea how much this would mean to me. I have found a couple of required books online in pdf form, but these are the ones I need and can't find online:**

",the_cellar_door,24,3,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/qynas/14000_km_in_25_days_reddit_were_going_on_a_solo/,"Hello Reddit!

Me and two friends are travelling to Mongolia this summer in the name of charity (and adventure). We´re going to drive an ambulance( or a van, or 4x4, it has to be something that the community we donate it to in Mongolia can use) from Spain, through France, Italy, Slovenia, Hungary, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, and finally into Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.  

A three person team composed of an Indian, a French-Italian, and a Portuguese is pretty improbable, so our teamname is **[The Improbables](http://www.madridtomongolia.com/)**. Internet permitting, we're going to give daily updates, with pics, videos, anecdotes...

It will be a solo rally, since we are leaving one month ahead of everyone else. We want to make the best of it, by getting to know as many people as we can in each country. Are you out there redditors? We want to meet you!

**Here are some ideas that we have so far, we need suggestions!**

 * Since I used to be a wedding photographer, I'd like to take pictures of a wedding or two in each country, to illustrate the similarities and differences between each country and culture.  Then we can self-publish a book out of it  and sell it to raise funds for Charity. See below which charities we've chosen.   What do **you** get out of it? A free wedding photographer!

* We'd like to interview a couple of entrepreneurs in each country, to get your startup some visibility, and maybe some investors. We'll create a video series, for which we're trying to find a sponsor, perhaps a Business School for example.   These days we hear a lot about the financial crisis, but not often enough do we hear about those who are trying to turn their ideas into reality despite of it.   

* We could do a recipe from each location, and teach our readers how to make that particular dish. 

* We really want to create a video like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1kdcbaiv2y4) Help us choose a song!

* We're going to do a drawing contest with all the children we meet through local charities, then we will give them prizes that our sponsors give us. 

**These are the nonprofits we've decided to help:**

* [Action Against Hunger](http://www.actionagainsthunger.org)
* [Go Help](http://www.justgiving.com/MadridtoMongolia) Link to our JustGiving page.

**So here's how you can help, in no particular order:**

* Tell us what to do! Any suggestions?
* I know it sounds cliché, but like our page on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/madridtomongolia) It will help us sell us find sponsors, because no one wants to sponsor three guys with 130 fans.
* Let me take pictures of your wedding!
* Let us crash on your couch!
* Buy us a drink! Invite us to a party!
* Help us find some sponsors.
* Help us find a car, this one is a bit of an emergency.

Thank you for your help, and see you on the road!

I come to you asking for help, at the request of a dear friend of mine, who I view like a brother.

Back in december, his Fiancee left him. They were living in my house at the time. He was down in the dumps, and at the time, had no real goals or purpose in life. Like a ship without a rudder.

We went down to the military recruiting center here in Huntsville, AL, and he joined the military. Turns out, he's really smart. He was accepted into the Nuclear program, and was doing very well. He is currently in Boot Camp.

Well, a week ago, during some Hell Week exercises, he managed to screw up his femurs. Both of them. He is stuck in Recovery Barracks for 2 more months, not allowed to do much of anything other than stand, sit, and watch. I've been writing him constantly, but I know that my one letter every two or three days isn't enough. He is bored out of his mind, and I need help!

If you, with kindness in your heart, would write him letters and send them to me, I will ensure they get sent. I will send them from my home, I'll pay postage and buy the envelopes. I'll print them out. And I will make sure that each letter is addressed by me, but that he knows who actually wrote it. I will also facilitate all replies back to the writers via Reddit.

A little about him:

-Gamer 

-Nuclear Technician Trainee in the Navy

-Tech Guru

-Gaming guy

-Not from a military background, but wanted to start a life for himself

-Single

-A very loyal and caring person

1323099842.0,21,self.RandomKindness,n16kh,[request] (UK) Birthday/Christmas cards for my husband. ,decline_,22,1,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/n16kh/request_uk_birthdaychristmas_cards_for_my_husband/,"Hello lovely people of Random Kindness,

My husband and I have have a hard few months: I had to leave my job, and then a slew of enormous bills happened all at once and left us in a small mountain of debt. Our families have been absolute superstars and have made sure that we've kept a roof over our heads, had heating and electricity and at least one good meal a day, but we haven't had anything nice in quite a while. I don't mean nice like cakes or trips to the cinema, but things like socialisation and general interaction with people outside of work and immediate family, so morale is quite low at the moment. 

My husband has also been a star and is working as much overtime as his company can give him to try and dig us back out of this hole. While things are looking slightly better for us now, we won't really be back on our feet until at least the middle of next year, or later if any other unexpected bills happen. 

My husband's birthday is on the 21st of December, and because things are so strained for us at the moment, I can't really do much for him. I'll be able to do some things for him, obviously; make him a little card, perhaps make him breakfast in bed, but I *really* want him to know how much I appreciate all of his hard work. This is where you come in!

Do you think you could send him a birthday card with happy wishes or a cheerful message? It would make an otherwise dreary, workaday birthday in to something a little more special for him and I know he'd appreciate it more than anything I could do for him all on my own. 

If you can send him a card, please let me know and I'll PM you my address. If you can't send him a card, perhaps you could wish him well on his birthday over the internets? I'll let you know his twitter name. 

Thank you so much for taking the time to read through all of this, it means an awful lot to me, and I know it'll make **Al** (that's his name!) feel amazing on his birthday. 


**edit**: *Some of you have been asking about his likes and dislikes for customisation purposes, so I thought I'd put 'em up here for everyone to see.* 

*He's pretty much your average codemonkey type geek. He works as a software engineer for a web design company and spends what seems like most of his time in front of a computer. He loves to game and set up a minecraft server for our friends and colleagues and he plays unreal tournament at lunchtime with his colleagues. He's a keen sci-fi fan, and loves all of the usuals (Doctor-Who, Eureka, Firefly) as well as loving comedy like The IT Crowd and The Mighty Boosh. He's also a keen traceur and spends a frightening amount of time jumping from one high place to another and shinning up the sides of walls and buildings. Also: we have 3 cats and although he won't admit it in public, he loves them more than I imagine he'd love his (imaginary!) firstborn. In fact, right now he's balancing a laptop and a cat on his knee simultaneously.*

Ohh! And his twitter is @altreus. Warning! Contains an ungodly amount of puns.

About two weeks ago I made a request asking for any old dress clothes anyone may have had lying around.  I am currently trying to save as much money as possible to afford graduate school applications in the next month, and buying professional looking clothing for interviews and my thesis defense would have only reduced the number of programs to which I could afford to apply.  I didn't expect a response, but I figured it was certainly worth a shot as someone may have had a spare shirt that no long fit or something.

Shortly after posting, I received a message from Glinda_Da_Good_Witch offering to ""get a few things together"" and ship them off.  A few days later (long after I thought the post had died off) I also received a message from ActOldLater asking if I could use a pair of dress shoes.  

I received both packages yesterday afternoon and am completely dumbstruck by the generosity of these two individuals.

ActOldLater sent off the pair of shoes (which fit perfectly by chance) went as far as to include a dress shirt, two ties, some dress socks, and a belt as well!  

Glinda_Da_Good_Witch filled a box with everything from jeans and t-shirts, to a set of dry cleaned dress shirts, and even decided to purchase two pairs of dress slacks as well!

While I am at work at the moment and am unable to post pictures, I will try to borrow a roommate's camera and upload a picture or two later this evening, but I just want to publicly express my extreme appreciation!  I am positively in awe at the incredible generosity.

So THANK YOU ActOldLater and Glinda_Da_Good_Witch for being some of the most amazing people with whom I've ever had the pleasure of interacting!

I noticed a lot of complaints about how this subreddit is getting a bit of a surge of gaming related posts, both offers and requests. This is completely understandable.

So much, in fact, that I'm going to change up my giveaways in order to have some spare cash to actually buy them. Here's a breakdown:

* I'm no longer going with the ""pick from your wishlist"" thing and instead it's just going to be ""I have a game here, who wants to win it?""
* But just giving away one game is boring! **I would love to have massive giveaway weekends, where we make a pot of games to give away and then give them all out to different people!** This would be a great option, because then everyone knows there's one spot to go to look for games
* **This isn't sponsored by the mods or anything** so it'll just be up to us, the community, to help put this together. So please, **Send me a message if you'd live to put more games into the ""pot"" for this or any other weekends!**

I brooded on it a bit, like ya do, and then decided that brooding was getting me nowhere.  Instead I'm going to do something nice for someone. It's not much, but it's all I can offer.  

SO, I want to offer up another free signed copy of my book.  It's really all I have to give right now since I'm sending these copies out with my own monthly 'mad money' but I'm of the belief that a book can be a good companion if you're lonely and if all else fails, do as Granny Weatherwax does and take it with you to the bathroom.  ;-) 

The deal is this - I want to give it away. I don't care if you want to sell it on Amazon or Ebay or keep it for your own personal library. That is up to you.  This book isn't an ARC, it's an actual copy of the book, so there aren't any typos (that I know of) or errors in the text.

I will sign said book with either a personalized message (if you think you want to keep it) or just my name (if you think you'll want to sell it).  Either way, I hope it helps you have a better week when it arrives.

I'll pick someone to get a copy tonight (sometime around midnight US Central time) and PM them tomorrow for their address.  This isn't going to be a numbers game, upvotes and downvotes don't matter to me - I'll probably just use a randomizer again or have my toddler pick a winner.

I hope everyone has a kickass Halloween.  Go have fun!

***EDIT***: Okay everyone, offer is over.  Ran the randomizer, picked the (2!) winners, will be PMing them shortly.  I'm going to give them a few weeks to respond and then I'll contact the runners-up at that point.  Thanks everyone!  My only sadness here is that I can't give a copy to everyone.

Rescued a little black cat (now named Calcifer) who had been abandoned in Arizona. After jumping some hoops with a few animal shelters he's now happily living with me and my other cat. I'd really love to get a cat tree for him to sort of redirect his tendency to jump on counters. It doesn't have to be fancy and I'm fine with hand me downs, and I've even made an Amazon wishlist for this occasion if anyone finds that potential way easier for helping?

Edit : 
Guess it helps to include my amazon list. http://amzn.com/w/2W6JG1LECU2DS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Now onto the story:

During a walk about a month or so ago I find this cute little cat wandering around, I call to him, like I do any cat I see outside in Az (it's hot and highly urbanized, so I'm always wary seeing cats outdoors) well he instantly started meowing loudly back at me and didn't run. I went over to pet him to find he was extremely skinny and clearly skittish, however not of me but the world around him. I decided to go back home to grab some of my own cat's food and bring it to him and see how he reacts. When I returned to where I had left him, he was nowhere to be found. I was worried he'd left, so I called him for a few minutes and low and behold he came running from the direction of my house (he literally followed me home) so I placed down his dish and let him scarf down his food, he spent a good 15 minutes alternating from scarfing to walking back to me to purr and rub himself against me frantically. Sort of like some odd animal version of thank you. I felt far too worried about his state to leave him and decided I would take him in and see if anyone in the area was missing a cat. After some questions it turned out, no, no one was, and in fact this cat was seen around the area a lot. So I started my almost week long search for a no kill shelter for the guy as I couldn't let such a sweet cat risk being put down, he's a fully black cat and older than a kitten, making it twice as unlikely that he'd be adopted in time in a place like Animal Control. (Fyi: I also found out a day into having him that he was declawed, which is ridiculously inhuman to have a declawed cat outside for obvious reasons) Sadly though, every cat shelter was full. I was starting to loose hope. I had him quarantined in my bathroom this whole time due to not being sure if he was healthy enough to be near my cat. I had to find figure out something fast. But by some stroke of luck and kindness a woman who owns Arizona Cactus Cats offered to essentially adopt him to us. Meaning I pay her a low fee that takes care of all the cat vet bills in their name as they have discounts from being an adoption center. I jumped on this opportunity and a few days later after a vet visit and a few papers signed he was mine officially.

 Calcifer is making a good transition into domestic home life, he seemed kind of confused by many things at first and spent most of his time hiding in a cabinet under the bathroom sink, and was a little sketchy of sounds around him, but I believe he must of been a house cat at one point and was simply abandoned as he quickly got into the swing of getting out of the cupboard and sleeping on chairs and playing with my female and the toys I have gotten him.

Now for the reason I'm here. Calcifer is apparently a tree dweller and likes to jump up onto tall things (aka: my counters &gt;.&lt;) and I'd really love to get a cat tree for him to sort of redirect this tendency. It doesn't have to be fancy and I'm fine with hand me downs, anything and I've even made an Amazon wishlist for this occasion if anyone wanted to help and figured that way would be easier. Both me, Calcifer and my 7 year old cat Chii would be so grateful for any random act of cat tree! &lt;3

Here are a few pictures of him for the curious.

This is one of his first days out of the cupboard (into the sink above it - . - ) he's still dirty as I hadn't worked up the nerve to try bathing him - http://i.imgur.com/AMTYP6D.jpg

Here's him on one of his first days out of the bathroom quarantine, after a good bath (that went quite well) and with his new collar I got him - http://i.imgur.com/YdTbpar.jpg

Here he is demonstrating his intense need to be high up. I was folding clothes and putting them away when I returned to this. He was immediately removed and discouraged from attempting that again. But it was cute in the moment. -http://i.imgur.com/SGbQ7ze.jpg

Last is of his favorite place in the house, warm and safe where he'll be for the rest of his life -http://i.imgur.com/WVG9bES.jpg

I generally try and make an effort to gift first, but I'm just really low right now, and could do with some cheering up. 

The guy I was KINDA talking to again (we were engaged at one time) and I are no longer speaking. He started seeing someone else, and just told me as an after thought (so that I wouldn't hear about it online). Mind you, he had invited me to come visit him again a few months prior, and we had made pretty solid plans for a visit in November. He asked me to come visit. And then this. It was just a low blow, you know? 

A couple months prior to that, my guitar was stolen. Which sucks - I'm a musician, and host a lot of open mic nights around the hill country in Texas. I've been borrowing from a friend for the time being, but I miss having my own. I had JUST bought it, too. 

And finally, my job....I mean I'm thankful I have one, but I wait tables at Ihop. And while normally I love my job, the past week has been brutal. For instance, I waited on a table of highschool boys who not only stiffed me, made fun of me (for I'm assuming my weight), and then one tried to run out on a 3 dollar ticket. *3 dollars*. I mean yes...it's a tiny amount. But I would have had to pay that. And then when I went outside to write down the kids license plate number, he straight up said he was going to ""slap me in the face for being such a cunt"". Who does that? Over three dollars. 

Anyway, I don't often complain. I work my ass off, and as a general rule I'm pretty happy. But things are just crappy right now. So someone suggested I come say hello to you nice folks, and that's what I'm doing. So hi! I appreciate all of you listening to my drivel, actually. It feels kinda good to get that off my chest. 

Also, I hope this is ok...but I'm running a contest over at Random Acts of Amazon and it's for charity! The winner gets a 75 dollar gift certificate to Amazon, and all you have to do is donate some books to charity. [Here is the link](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1f3187/contest_donate_books_to_charitywin_a_kindle_or_a/). If this isn't ok, please let me know and I will remove this.

So at my work, they're having a postcard contest where the goal is to get as many postcards as you can by June 30, 2013 (can be postmarked by June 30th).  As of right now, I'm up to around 25 cards, but I would love to have more!  They haven't even announced what the prize is going to be, but I just want to win!  If you're interested in helping, PM me and I'll provide you with my name and address

Here is a pic of what I have so far.  If you need proof (i.e., want to see the back of some of these cards, just let me know and I'll PM you some pics.

[All Cards](http://i.imgur.com/tiLRMm6.jpg)  

Here are the rules of the contest:  

Rules:

* Postcard can be from anywhere around the globe.
* It can be any kind of postcard.  
* The postcard itself has to be **safe for work** in order to be eligible.
* You can write any message you want on there, just as long as it's **safe for work.**   

**For those that aren't, I shall construct a mural of them and post a picture on reddit.**

**To get reddit gold:** I'll give reddit gold to whomever can send me a card.  I don't think many people will take the time to send one anyway, so it's not a big deal.  Even if I do get a bunch, reddit gold goes to everyone!  In order for me to give reddit gold, just include your username on the postcard itself and once I receive it, I'll send some gold your way!

Thanks in advance to anyone who can help!

I have my old (2008 Compaq Presario C700) laptop that I no longer use. Despite great temptation to pull an Office Space on it, after speaking with my wife, we have decided to just give it away without it's hard drive. Luckily, the windows key for vista (sorry, it's what it came with), is still very readable. I won't lie, she isn't super powerful, just an old celeron processor with 2gb of ram, and it really can't handle games. It has a busted corner from an old fall, so the headphones/mic spots don't work (usb ones still work), and the speakers kick in when they feel like it (they were damaged in the fall too). It only has 3 usb ports, and 1 doesn't like to work unless you hold the usb at an angle. The #5 and C buttons fell off too :( still works with a little tug.

Other than the listed problems, it works just fine for typing, browsing the web, storing music, what have you. It really isn't a bad laptop, I recently booted it up to transfer off some music, and it was pretty fast actually. I just no longer need it. It has survived one deployment, and many trips back home with me, and hopefully someone could make good use of it. 

It's gonna need a hard drive, it takes a normal 2.5in SATA drive (150-250gb refurbs can be had on newegg for like 25$ and will need the OS reinstalled), and it will come with a mousepad/mouse/usb laptop cooler/power cord. Mostly, it just needs a new home. Now, I suppose the best thing is that people tell me why they need it, and after a day or two I pick the best. Please don't ask if you really don't need it, and for any potential scammers, if at anytime I feel the charity of the offer has been taken advantage of, I will be looking into whatever legal options I have for fraud. With that said, no P.O. boxes or addresses that are shady. 

And I guess that's it. [Here's a couple pics](http://imgur.com/a/U5iel).

It affects everything. I go into and out of depression from shit in my life and when I come out, they always seem to fight and I sink back in. I do everything they ask me and they can't figure anything out. They always seem to drink, watch a movie, then start yelling at each other nearly every Saturday night that I don't spend with them. Sometimes I waste a Saturday night being with them and watching a movie I had already seen or not interested by to make sure they don't fight. When they do, I can hear it from anywhere in the house and through my music playing through my head phones. My mom always ends up crying and sleeping in the guest bedroom while my dad usually goes to their room and goes to bed or goes and plays BF games on the computer for a while. I don't know what the problem is and that is what frustrates me. Its not the influence of alcohol because I can always hear them say something about the other when the other isn't around like ""You're being like your dad"" or ""Stop bitching and just do it"". My dad said the second one earlier today when she left the car to grab a table while we parked at a restaurant. Sometimes now I dread my dad coming home from work because he could piss my mom off somehow in one way or the other. The only thing that I know makes each other fight is when my dad plays games on the computer rather than hanging out with her and my sister. I feel like I am to blame for that because I got him into playing computer games. I can't stand it when they fight and it tears me into pieces. I get a lump in my throat, feel guilt for some reason, and feel like hope is gone. It makes me just want to stop what I do and sleep until I forget about it for a while. It always comes back to haunt me though later and distracts me especially at school. I just need some words from other people who are and have been through this to give me some help or tips for what to do.

I was recently blown away by the generosity of the people of Reddit when I put out a call for birthday cards for my fiance on a few subreddits ... and the number of people who immediately put their hands up and were happy to help was amazing (and it made her cry - in a good way - that so many people she never met would take the time to wish her a happy birthday)

The reaction to both of these : My post on /r/PenPals and My post on /r/RandomKindness was beyond what I could have dreamed ...

But now I come to the hard bit .... Recently one of my good friends found out that his brother has cancer of the liver and has spread to three different parts of his spine. One of his vertebrae collapsed due to this and now on top of it all he has a fractured spine.

All his life my friend has devoted his time to being there for his brother as he has been in and out of hospital since he was born with ongoing heart issues.

My friend Doug explains the situation much better than me ... http://youtu.be/gZbgdh9iTOQ

and the website is 
http://www.mycause.com.au/page/friendinneed

I am asking if people can send ""Thinking of You"" or ""Get Well"" cards ... that kind of thing ... something to surprise them with ... 
something to make his family smile ....

Please send all cards to Joong Cho c/o

Thanks in advance for your generosity.

Many thanks!

**The rundown:** My 8 year old son (who, I might add, has an *amazing* heart and even inspires *me* sometimes) is raising money for the American Heart Association, by participating in their ""Jump Rope For Heart"" fundraiser. Not only is this a great cause, but it would make a wonderful Valentine's Day gift for someone with needs much greater than chocolates, flowers, and sappy poetry... and, for our family, it has a very personal meaning as well. If you'd like to be a ""sponsor"" (IE: make a donation) to help the AHA and make a little kid's day, [**please click here**](http://jumpmwa.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?msource=Gigya&amp;ievent=1036371&amp;supId=375573258). I know it sounds cheesy, but even a couple bucks can make a difference. Even if you can't donate, a minute or two of your time helping to spread the word would be genuinely appreciated! Our story/motivation for joining this cause can be read below, for those who may be interested. 

**The backstory/sappy stuff:** To make a long-ish story short, my best (and, at the time, only) friend of around 15 years, who I had been dating for roughly 8 months, died on 1/21/10 at 30 years old, from a blood clot in his heart. There was absolutely no warning, and it killed him instantly, leaving gaping wounds in a number of hearts and lives, including his infant son and my children who all knew him as ""daddy"" as well. If that weren't enough to get us up and fundraising, we have a number of friends and family members who have had heart problems, and one of my older sons and I were both born with heart murmurs (our murmurs weren't *terribly* serious, thankfully).

**The TL;DR:** I guess the easiest way to summarize would be to say that we can barely shoulder the weight of our own financial and emotional burdens right now, but we want to do everything we can, if we can, to minimize those burdens for others- and that's where you guys can make a tremendous difference [**for a really great cause**](http://jumpmwa.kintera.org/faf/donorReg/donorPledge.asp?msource=Gigya&amp;ievent=1036371&amp;supId=375573258).

The story is titled ""I Know what they are."" It's an odd little horror story with a few drops of humor about a young woman who interacts with the city’s homeless population as she walks to work each morning. Her life takes a turn into strange territory when she meets a homeless lady wearing a lab coat, and holding a sign that reads: I know what they are.


It began as a [NoSleep story](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/wvqc3/i_know_what_they_are/) a few months ago. I thought it had potential, so I expanded it to 5,000 words. A few editors helped me polish it. 

It's on amazon kindle ($2.99), and through smashwords distribution ($0.99) But you can grab it for free as a PDF or ePub.

I hope you enjoy it. Any feedback or reviews are appreciated.

 I know this isn't your typical post, but I figured it's worth a shot. I'm over here on the east coast, but I'm trying to help a friend (in Dallas, TX) leave her abusive husband before he gets home from work today. She has no access to money, no car, and no where to go. I'm helping her look up shelters, but everywhere is full. So far we've tried the Genesis Shelter, Denton County Friends of Family, Hope's Door, Brighter Tomorrows, and a few others. Her phone died but she going to call the ones on the sidebar at r/DomesticViolence too.

Any advice? She's fucking terrified. Thanks for reading.

Super ninja edit! The emotional abuse is unbearable for her. She's terrified that he's going to start beating her. ""You can hear it in his voice."" He's also threatened to kill her and the cops let the guy go with his gun. And now, a lot of these places are turning her down because she isn't getting beaten. Again, any advice is welcome.

They wrote me an amazing choose your own adventure story [which was close to my heart, since I love playing tabletop D&amp;D and other roleplaying games] And it simply MADE MY WEEK. Enough thanks couldn't be had... Truly an amazing person.

2.) **ErraticSchematic**- When my girlfriend and I WERE dating, ErraticSchematic offered to knit a hat for her. Well, it arrived last week, and [my now amicable] ex Loves it. It's made her week. It was such high-quality and we could tell how much love and care went into it... It was spectacular.

2.) **Awesome_Endless**- This wonderful Redditor gifted me a sophisticated, intricate RPG called Arx Fatalis on [Gog.com](www.gog.com) when I was feeling down... Well, I've logged 30 hours into it, and I could not be happier. I want to thank them so much for this simple but meaningful gift, it is truly phenomenal.

To pay it forward for all the kindness I received, I scooped up dozens of my old games [dozens, literally] and traded them in to my local game store... I had about $100 in Store credit- and I paid off two of my friend's Skyrim preorders to surprise them when they arrived to pick it up [a total of 110 dollars, had to dive into my couch to pay off the rest]

He followed me alongside of old buildings to the parking lot where my car was and sparked a usual ""street-beggar/under-the-bridge-junkie"" conversation. I was just waiting for him to start asking me for some change to spare but he never did. The man told me about his fighting days in Vietnam and his peaceful days as a veteran living in New Orleans. As he was telling me how he failed in trying to save his drowning wife and son during the hurricane Katrina floods - that story got deeper and sadder. By then we already made it to my car - I shared good smoke with the man, knowing that's the least I can do to brighten up that guys' life. But I felt helpless knowing there really isn't much I could've done. He went on for a while telling me how he's sitting here in LA because here he has higher chance of getting his benefits as a hurricane survivor than in New Orleans and he spends his days and nights on the 4th street between Main and San Pedro around the Toy District. His story touched me and the least I could do is listen to the man.

Next couple of days I'll gather up few things like clothes, blankets and whatever food can be prepared on the street and take it down there to him. I think just having a friend is a rare and good thing, let alone having a friend that can help when you are in the worst situation. Not too many people are willing to deal with the ugly and sad part of life such as poverty, addictions, abuse, mental health issues or just plain ""dealing with sad people"" - takes us out of the comfort zone, it's understandable.

If you want to help me - do the same thing. Commit random acts of humanity, humility and kindness. It goes a very long way and is the last chance for our society to survive and be humans. And if you're Downtown LA picking up some stuff for your kids in the Toy District say hi to Byron.

Check out my little website and peruse my work. If you're interested, please comment here and let me know why you'd like a plush. It doesn't have to be a sad story, doesn't have to be happy either - just be honest. :) I'll choose a recipient at around 5:00 CST tomorrow and PM them to let them know they've won, as well as to ask what sort of plush they'd like. I'll also edit this post to reflect that I've chosen a winner.

Here's my website: http://tofuthis.wordpress.com - there you'll find a link to my DeviantArt gallery (or you can just go to http://akillertofu.deviantart.com/gallery if you'd like a short cut), as well as recent work that I've been too lazy to upload to DA in my blog posts.

I always feel bad that I can't choose everyone, so if you DON'T get the free plush, I'm more than happy to work with you on a pretty hefty discount. I just can't afford to ship too many packages for free, and supplies are... well, in short supply, for lack of a better phrase. 

Post away, my friends! I'm excited to help someone out. Unfortunately this is open to the United States and Canada only - I just can't swing shipping elsewhere out of pocket! :( 

Thanks guys! Keep on being awesome! Much love from Texas &lt;3

*EDIT* I've chosen someone to gift. Thank you everyone who entered!

So many things lately have just been eating at me and it's really, really starting to get serious.

These last few days have been terrible. I've been sleep-depraved and then having to deal with scores of extremely awful students who have zero idea how to be respectful and kind. Most of the time, I substitute for a school district near here that pays very little above minimum wage because they're the only ones offering work, so I'm basically being abused for next to nothing. And it's difficult to even turn down a day of work when I'm sick or know it's a class that's going to give me the worst kind of hell, because as a sub if I don't accumulate enough teaching hours, they'll retract my teaching certification. Which means taking four expensive tests all over again. My second job also cut my hours down to 1/3 what they used to be, all because I could only work till 8pm at night instead of 9. 

Both my husband and I are always stressed out because our bills are coming due, and we've had our insurance screw us because they double-charged my husband's paycheck and we've literally been fighting them for two weeks to get it back. We're overcharged for this small apartment but now can't afford to move because it would require a down payment on a new place that we don't have, and we also have pets which 99% of all places around here won't accept.

And lately, the Christmas spirit to me just feels absolutely dead. I've tried so hard to get into it and try to look at it positively, but all that keeps coming are more and more problems. I do everything I can this time of year to help out those that are in even worse situations that us, and yet I can never seem to get even a bit of good luck or karma to come our way. I even budgeted and got some good gifts for relatives, but they almost never do the same.  getting pretty sick of always trying so hard on everything, especially this time of year, only to be let down. I'm really on the verge of shoving the cheap tree and lights back into the closet and calling it quits, because it feels like the happiness of it all is gone.

Unfortunately, life has dealt me a HECTIC hand these past few weeks. I wanted to do much more for people but simply got overwhelmed. So here is round two, with a definite cutoff for the number of people I take on. This should keep me from getting too swamped.

DA RULEZ:

- Only doing basic beanies this time. Slouches and earflaps prove to be too time consuming. 

- Colors can be as many or as few as you'd like. 

- This is a free hat. IT IS FREE.

- Other more complex styles may be considered. If you have a link to the pattern I will be more likely to consider it. Ravelry has a good search engine for free hat patterns. I just don't have the time to write my own patterns for this round.

- Please agree to post a thank you post here in RK. A picture of the hat or you wearing it would also be much appreciated.

There will be five slots. The cutoff time for posting below is 11 PM Central time, tomorrow night. Check back here to see if your name made the list!

!UPDATE!: Slots have been filled with the help of my [fiance](http://reddit.com/u/hdatz).

1. Whenamanlovesa_ama (tentative, someone else may be doing this one)

2. Circuit_Deity

3. Whales_Vagina23

I don't want her to have to drop out of college.",QuixoticChemist,28,7,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/13gd7a/requestusal_friend_in_a_tight_spot_i_dont_want/,"My best friend, a 19 year old female, is in a very tight spot right now. She works two jobs and goes to school full time. Her family makes her pay rent and the family cell phone bill to live in their house. Despite her family paying for her little brother to go to private school, she has not received one penny of assistance for college. Due to working full time and going to school full time, she maintains a C average. I am even proud of her for this since she gets in a 2 a.m. most nights, then gets up for 8 a.m. classes and does it all again. Because of the C average, she does not qualify for most scholarships. Her student loans are maxed out this semester. She does not have time to take on yet another job. 

She owes the university $1000 by November 26th. If she does not pay this, she will be un-enrolled from all of her classes. This is even worse because she has been fighting to do so well this semester and has made vast grade improvements. If she can finish out this semester, improving her GPA, she may qualify for scholarship again next semester! If she can get past this hump, things will get a little easier financially.

This girl deserves help more than anyone I know. She has always selflessly been there for every friend she has. She has ended up with the short end of the stick so many times in her life that I am surprised it has taken her this long to feel defeated. She works her tail off everyday to be a good student, employee, and person. If I had $1000 to give her i would, but I really can only spare a little. I am definitely giving her that little. 

Do you have any idea on how to collect $1000 in a week? I would appreciate ideas or any contributions I could find. I have never asked for money before in my life, but I am willing to beg for this girl. If you PM me I am willing to give you any information I can if you know of a way to help her. Thank you.

TL;DR The best person I know is $1000 short on a college payment. Ideas or contributions would be a magical blessing. I do not know another place to turn. 

Edit: We are considering a small personal loan. I am not asking for any one person to donate $1000 as that is a huge amount of money, but small amounts or ideas on how to earn the money, are very very welcome.

It has come to our attention our rule regarding monetary requests has been a little confusing. For a while we thought that it was nice to see the subreddit come together as a whole to help someone out for a good cause or fundraiser, so we left an unspoken rule that requests for flat out money via paypal were against the rules, but fundraisers were not as long as they went through some fundraising website to collect those funds.

It seems that for both our members, and us as mods, it was a blurry line to enforce. Lately, all fundraising requests have gone largely ignored, at least from our standpoint. Therefore, we feel it is in the best interest of the subreddit to amend the rule to state that: **No monetary requests will be allowed, regardless of intent.**

While this includes fundraisers and flat out requests for money, it does not include asking for a gift card somewhere, such as to Walmart or Dominos. We will, however, request that any persons looking to request money please visit /r/Assistance or /r/Loans. 

**From this point forward, all posts not in line with the rule will be removed.**

Please post your questions, concerns and comments below and I'll make sure to answer them all.",,False,self,t5_2szh3,False,,10Kmod,True,t3_zput3,http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomKindness/comments/zput3/rk_regarding_monetary_requests_and_fundraisers/,moderator
