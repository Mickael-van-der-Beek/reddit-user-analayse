We thought we had enough and didn't need to go to the ATM.  

There were about 10 people behind us waiting to get in.  EVERY SINGLE ONE of them, with swim cards and with dollars, offered to make up the difference for us.  Who ended up paying?  The attendent said to not worry about it and bring an extra two bucks when we came  next time.  

Austin is my home.  I love this town.  I will not only bring an extra two dollars when I head to Deep Eddy again, but I also plan on paying the kindness of the people behind us forward.

I have a job but I haven't gotten paid yet, so I have no money. I have no car. I don't even have a bike. I'm laying in the grass under this big ass oak tree near Highland mall, trying to will myself to sleep. I'm out of options right now. Its fucking cold. I don't know if this is allowed but... I really need some help. Of any kind. I have my phone and that's how I'm posting this. I appreciate anyone that actually took the time to read this. Thanks. '

UPDATE:
Thanks for all the support guys. Last night three guys met up with me at IHOP and we shot the shit for a little while, ate some pancakes, and parted ways. /u/AustinBQ02 offered me a place to sleep and we talked until the fucking sun was coming up before I crashed. When I woke up we went and got some of my clothes from my friend's apartment and he drove me alll the way to the south side of town and brought me to my buddy's place (who somehow recognized who I was based on this post and messaged me on facebook to offer me a place to stay). Major thanks to /u/AustinBQ02 , /u/Go0n , and /u/ChaosThirteen for helping me out. I'll never forget you guys and what you did for me.

Little did I know I'd be dealing with something so surreal and serious in a matter of seconds. I didn't do the actual saving, but a guy next to me swam up with an unconscious guy and asked if he was with us. When I finally came to attention and realized it wasn't a joke, all hell broke loose. I pulled him out of the water and laid him down on the side walk and continued to watch over the course of an hour as he sat there motionless. My worst suspicion was confirmed soon after. He was 21 years old, worked out everyday and was in good shape, and as far as I know was completely sober. He didn't flail, he didn't scream or make a noise. He simply went under, and didn't come back up, maybe 5 feet away from the railing. 

Please be careful. Barton is a beautiful place, and water's such a great blessing. But it's a double edged sword. Keep an eye on everyone. Just be aware. It could be the difference between saving a person from the water, and pulling a body out.

My heart goes out to his friends that were swimming near him, and the family who now deals with an unimaginable loss. I never wish to go through anything like that again. His lifeless eyes will be ingrained in my mind for as long as I live.

Edit: Here's an official [news article](http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/local/austin/swimmer-pulled-from-barton-springs-pool) on it. It's spot on, minus Barton's tweet that ""lifeguards were the ones who preformed CPR"", as there were so many qualified medical personnel around that a nurse was the initial administer. The lifeguards did a fantastic job of responding however, and keeping everything organized (and clearing the entire park). I'd like to just say that, for what happened, I'm not sure anything could have gone smoother. Everything was quick, he was maybe under water for 20-30 seconds, and almost as soon as I laid him down on the concrete, the nurse (wish I could thank her) took things into her own hands until lifeguards and park employees had run over.",,False,self,t5_2qhn5,1370538390.0,,,True,t3_1fso8s,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1fso8s/i_pulled_the_kid_that_died_at_barton_springs_out/,

",darrendloux,428,114,234,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/111899/i_got_kicked_out_of_whole_foods_today_midsandwich/,"While sitting at the Whole Foods flagship store in downtown Austin this past Friday, eating my pre-pedicabbing dinner and chatting with my friend on the patio, a security guard walked directly up to me and said ""Is that your pedicab parked in front of the store? You can finish what you're doing, but it isn't allowed on the property. You have to leave.""

Huh? Really? That's...bizarre.

I asked him why it wasn't allowed on the property and he told me that a pedicabber had removed property from the premises once and that pedicabs hadn't been allowed to park here since. I asked him if all modes of transportation were banned once someone was found stealing. Of course not. Okay then, I said, I'd like to speak to a manager. So a manager came out and further explained that soliciting wasn't allowed on the property and thus they had banned pedicabs from parking on the property. 

Now, mind you, I wasn't sitting in my pedicab hassling people for rides. It was locked to a bike rack in front of the store. It had been there for 20 minutes while I picked out a sandwich, some Clif bars and a drink and sat with my friend to eat. There was no soliciting. The idea of soliciting had never even entered my mind.

As a logical comparison, I asked if taxis were banned from parking on the property. Again, no. 

At this point, the woman sitting next to me got involved in the conversation and asked ""So wait, if I'm driving a van and it has an Avon magnet on the side, is that not allowed either? I might solicit someone."" 

Again, the answer was no.

""Well, you just lost another customer,"" she replied.

Though I had not made a single effort at solicitation, I was told I had to leave the property. I could not park on Whole Foods property. I was welcome to shop there, but couldn't park on the property. 

This, from a company that prides itself as a green company. A company that lists ""caring about our communities &amp; our environment"" among its [core values](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/core-values). A company that [says](http://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/mission-values/core-values/declaration-interdependence) it ""is intimately tied to the neighborhood and larger community that we serve and in which we live"". A company headquartered in a neighborhood where nearly 500 pedicabs regularly operate. A company that tries to align itself with the cycling community by offering bicycle grocery delivery and tool stands outside its store.

A company that bans my bicycle because my bicycle, while I'm working, has three wheels and happens to provide an environmentally conscious and viable method of transportation. 

Pardon my French, but are you fucking kidding me with this bullshit, Whole Foods?

I can understand that they don't want a line of pedicabs soliciting their customers, causing traffic and parking issues and generally being nuisances.

White male, 30s, 6'00'', beard, brown hair

My daughter was walking to my house this evening from her mother's (we live a block away), when the described vehicle and man pulled up alongside her. 

He said: ""I know your father. He wants me to give you something. But it's not in the car. Get in so we can get it.""

My daughter refused. He opened the door, exposed himself and began masturbating.

This is being treated as a child sex abuse crime by the police because my daughter is 12. According to the police random incidents like this (where the victim doesn't know the assailant) are particularly rare and dangerous. A person like this will continue to do things until they are caught.

Again: South West Austin, near Davis and Mopac, at Treehouse and Eskew. At 5:29 this evening.

I'm sleeping on a sleeping bag, and I'm going to have to turn to charity for groceries until next Friday, but I made it. Fuck the world and the hand it dealt me, I won. 

To those of you who showed me charity, be warned, I'm coming for you. Coming straight for you with gifts of furious gratitude. 

Forgive my terribly arrogant attitude, but I didn't think I'd ever be able to get out of that awful shitty mess I was in, and without overstating the accomplishment, I'd like to say I weathered it well, doing most of the work myself, turning to the charity of others rarely without a shovel in my hand.

Went to HEB to get groceries for the week. Wearing athletic shorts so no pockets. Put wallet in that little tray thing on the shopping cart and bought my groceries. 

About an hour after I got home, I realized I don't have my wallet. Must have left it on the shopping cart after I put the groceries in my car.

Start getting pissed because I'm going to have to stand in line to get a new drivers license, CHL, cancel all my debit and credit cards, blah blah. The $600 in cash I had was the least of my worries. 

Decided to call HEB just to see if the off chance someone turned it in.

Turns out, they did -- with every last thing in it. 

- $600 cash

- Debit and credit cards with enough credit to have a damn nice shopping spree

- Various gift cards

Whoever turned my wallet in, I cannot thank you enough.

Would love to return the favor, somehow. 

The generosity was inspiring so I went up to Walmart and used the $600 to pay down some layaways with kids clothes, toys, etc. 

Good on you, Austin.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhn5,False,,,True,t3_1emnwb,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1emnwb/to_whoever_found_my_wallet_at_heb_on/,

It will take place on or near enough to  a downtown bridge that it will need to be closed.  Beer in plastic cups will be $20.  There will be many small tents selling nothing you have ever wanted aka 'artisan crafts' aka jewelry bought from Native American reservations and resold.  There will be a big radio station sponsored stage featuring a band you've never heard of who's bassist once played in a band that you thing you've heard of either because they might've been famous or more likely 'locally famous' in the late 80's which means the Austin Chronicle will be a sponsor because they are still mad that it is not permanently 1989 in Austin when Daniel Johnson was only haha crazy and not scary humanoid-zeppelin-with-a-broken-control-panel-crazy. Many cops will be hired to stand around looking bored.  Only male cops.  Only the very short barrel-chested ones who either have to be tan or dark-skinned to not get sunburned because they never wear hats no matter how long they stand in the sun.  No one knows why this is.

The word 'Weird' will be printed onto a sticker and plastered onto everything: beer cups, lampposts, corporate sponsor tents, Pepsico schwag, stoner schwag, children under the age of 6 and the expansive bottoms of visitors from Corpus. Periodic announcements will be made over a PA system to let you know what a fun time you are having.  Whenever bands are not playing the local radio station/HEBuddy tent will blast pop music enjoyed only by the most mentally stunted teenagers and/or seasonal residents of West Campus.  Strollers that are bigger than cars are warmly welcomed.  Smaller strollers or baby carrier backpacks are discouraged.  You need to protect your child from events like potential nuclear war at all times.

Do you like Wells Fargo?  We think they're great and just thought you should know every five minutes.

What are we celebrating? Festivals, sillybilly.  Here, have a tiny bottle of Auqafina water for $25.

30,000 people will show up because this is a festival.  In Austin.  With sponsors!  20% of the visitors will be families.  35% of visitors will be families with 40+ members.  15% of visitors will alcoholic bikers with skin like old fried chicken. 5% of visitors will be children who do not have parents but they do have a large bucket of soda. 10% of visitors will be women from Lakeway who get tired of taking naps and horse tranquilizers within their 15,000 sq ft. Bluth Family-built McMansions all by their lonesomes.  15% of visitors will have driven all the way from Dallas or Houston.  Because, despite the fact that those two cities have a combined population of over 8 million there is nothing to do there unless you want to eat or go to a church with a trendy name like The Grotto (They have A ROCK BAND!).  Somehow, everyone who attends FestivalFest will end up at Home Slice or Guero's afterwards.

Please come to FestivalFest!  We are on a weekend.  We might be on every weekend, we can't remember.  Will this bassline from a Black Eyed Peas song entice you?  BUMMMMM BUMMM BUMMMM BUMMM

See you soon.

1338480776.0,219,self.Austin,ue1f1,There is a good chance I saved a guy's life last night. And also made my right hand smell like shit all day. Proceed...,Suckapuncha,272,53,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/ue1f1/there_is_a_good_chance_i_saved_a_guys_life_last/,"So I was driving home from pool league, and as I came up on the intersection of Northland and Shoal Creek, I saw something big in the road. As I approached, I saw it was a person. Just lying in the intersection. So I pulled over and went to make sure they weren't dead. Turns out it was this 20 - 23 year old dude named Dylan. He told me he got drunk and ate acid with his friends, and then they stole his wallet, robbed him, and dropped him off in that intersection.

I tried to point out that he had his wallet in his pocket, since he pulled it out and waved it in front of me when he told me how his ""friends"" stole it. Then he put it back in his pocket. But he was convinced it was gone. 

So I asked him where he lived and he told me he lived over on Brentwood by North Lamar. He explained several times he would have taken a cab but he got robbed by his friends. Then he apologized to me for living with his mom, and asked if I was going to arrest him. It took me about 10 minutes to convince him I wasn't a cop, and that I also did not judge him for living with his mom.

So after I succeeded in convincing him that I wasn't taking him to jail, I asked if he wanted a ride home. He accepted and I helped him walk to the car and get in. Surprisingly he gave awesome directions. The only time he messed up is when we were on Brentwood and he goes, ""Oh that's it right back there."", and pointed behind us while still looking forward. So I turned around, and he pointed out his place. I helped him out of the car and up to the door.

He searched around in his pockets for a minute, then he pulled out this damp wad of cash, out of his underwear I think, and tried to hand it to me saying, ""I got robbed, but I have about $400 left if you want it."". Trying to collect on some good karma, and being a little concerned about where he produced the bills from, I respectfully declined and told him to keep his money. He shoved it back into his shorts and then fiddled around for a bit before stating that he lost his key.

He told me that since he couldn't get in, he wanted to trip balls somewhere beautiful. So he said he appreciated the ride, but he was going to walk to Austin - Bergstrom and buy a ticket to Australia. Then he proceeded to walk out into the street and stumble along, knocking over a garbage can in front of the house. I wasn't sure what to do, so I knocked on the door and a woman asked who it was. I asked her through the door if she had a son named Dylan, after which she opened the door with haste looking very concerned. I assume she thought I was a police officer also, possibly delivering bad news about her child.

Once she saw I wasn't a cop, her look turned to confused. I told her how I found a guy named Dylan in the intersection at Northland and Shoal Creek and he said he was drunk and tripping on acid. She told me that Dylan was her son and she felt responsible because she was a recovering addict who had been sober for the last 12 years. But prior to that, Dylan had watched her drink and do drugs his whole childhood. So she was concerned he was following in her example.

I told her that I didn't know her, but she seemed to be doing the best she could. But at that moment, her son was attempting to walk to the airport. i asked her if she wanted me to help her find him and bring him back, and she thanked me and said she would appreciate it. So we started walking toward the direction where Dylan had headed. When we got about two blocks down I told her I didn't think he could have made it that far, and we must have missed him.

We started back and I heard a kind of whimpering by her neighbor's house. So we opened the gate and found Dylan crying on the porch seat of the neighbor's house. His mom talked him into getting up and coming home after about 5 minutes, and I kind of had to let him lean on me while we walked him back because he was too big for her to brace, and he was having trouble walking. Once we got to the house, I helped him to the couch and he seemed content.

His mom thanked me again, and asked Dylan to thank me, at which point he tried to give me the gross wad of cash again. I declined again and left. On my way out, I saw the dumped out garbage and felt kind of bad about the mom having to deal with it, so I picked up the trash and put it back in the garbage can and set it back up on the curb.

I drove home and washed my hands about 10 times, but I couldn't get the garbage smell off of my right hand. Finally I said fuck it, and got ready to go to bed cause I had to be up for work at 6:00AM, and the clock was showing 4:12AM. I felt that I was going to regret that shit when I got up for work, but I don't at all. In fact, besides the gross smelling hand, which by the way has finally worn off, it was a pretty interesting night. And I feel like I may have actually saved that guy's life.

**TL;DR - I found a dude lying in an intersection tripping on acid and gave him a ride home. Ended up meeting his mom and picking up trash.**

**Edit: I just wanted to say a couple of things since people have asked me...**

 - I don't know if he was ever actually with his friends or not. That is just what he said. So if any of you are his friends, I wasn't judging, just repeating what he said.

 - I don't know if he really had $400. He just pulled out a wad of money and said it was about $400. I didn't count it, so again, I was just repeating what he told me.",,False,self,t5_2qhn5,1338585790.0,,,True,t3_ue1f1,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/ue1f1/there_is_a_good_chance_i_saved_a_guys_life_last/,

I stepped outside to smoke a cigarette and noticed a food trailer across the street. I decided to go buy a bottle of water. While I was waiting for the lady at the window, I noticed a guy with a cool iron-man phone cover. I made small talk with him about it and he was a cool guy, telling me where he got it (Dragon's Lair, i think) and how my day was going.  When the lady came to the window she told me the water was $1 but another $1 for card transactions. She told me to go ahead and take the water when I said I would come back after borrowing a dollar from a friend inside because I had no cash. Then the guy with the phone cover came up and paid for my water. I tried to say it was okay but he insisted. So I thanked him and went back to the show.


I know a dollar isn't much but that whole interaction made my day. The guy was so nice and the lady was so nice too. It makes me smile thinking about the friendly ""stand-off"" between the lady and the guy. She was insisting on giving the free water while the guy was insisting on paying for a stranger's water. I feel like this is the type of Austin experience that makes me enjoy living here. Maybe it's a Texas thing. I've been in LA, NYC, and other major cities (including international) but experiences like this were rare to come by.

It seems that this is becoming a real problem here in Austin this year.,cadycat,228,33,117,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1b15pw/my_best_friend_was_hit_and_killed_at_the_ion_on/,"[KVUE releasing her identity](http://www.kvue.com/home/Police-investigate-double-hit-and-run-196276981.html)

I just want to say that she was a delight to be around. She loved red wine, Marlboro lights, reggae music, marijuana, her shiatsu, summer, stand-up comedy, living in Austin, her friends, and her family. 

The night of the crash, her and her two roommates, her on-and-off boyfriend of six years, and a few other close friends went to sixth street. Her and the boyfriend decided to go home early. They took the bus home. The last thing he remembers is them being on the bus and talking about how they couldn't wait to get home and go to sleep. Apparently, at the scene, the cops said he had been giving her a piggy back when it happened, and he was holding her in his arms when they arrived. Thankfully, he doesn't remember any of this. I hope for his sanity that he never does. He is okay. We're all making it day by day, but he is physically alright.

She was my best friend. We moved to Austin together. We fought like sisters and loved each other like I'm sure you love your best friend.

It's a long shot, and nothing will change what happened, but if anyone has any information, call the APD. 

Also, if you do hit someone, stop. For the love of everything beautiful, stop. 

EDIT: It happened at approximately 2 AM Friday, March 8th. And as the report does not say, she did live there. He did not.

EDIT2: The ID picture they provided does not serve her beauty any justice, so here is a picture of me and her. She went by the name Katy, short for her middle name Kaitlin, her entire life.

Halfway down the road I got sucker punched pretty hard in the middle of the back of the head. I turned to face the attacker, the second guy sucker punched me in the temple. A third guy kicked me in the midsection while the first guy landed a few more blows to back of my head.

That's when I finally went down. They started kicking the living shit out of me and I screamed, ""Just take my bag!"" It was a computer looking bag, but no laptop, but they did steal my iPad.

Just wanted the rest of you to know that Oltorf around Congress and 1st is getting a little hairy. Dude said I was the second one this month who had gotten mugged in his yard.

And this was on Oltorf. At 11pm. A busy street.

Be careful my fellow Redditors, and avoid obvious computer bags in this area, we obviously got muggers in South Austin.

One a positive note, I am a 37 year old man who can take a beating from 3 20 year olds and walk away.

Also, Police and EMS were top notch, and I even got a visit from the Austin CSI! 

Ask me anything.

Btw, here is the worst spot:

* Please don't drive like an asshole (if you are driving at all).  Now I am not calling you an asshole, just asking you to not drive like one.  If you can take public transportation and help ease the load of us non-SXSWers, please do.

* Please don't drink and drive, just FYI it is a no refusal weekend, so basically they are getting your BAL anyways so just don't.

* If you do drive, please watch out for cyclists, they are everywhere and don't want you going home with chunks of people on your car. 

* Be nice (I know all redditors are nice anyways, but just a plea).  If I accidentally bump into you, it was just a mistake and no need to get all uptight about it.

* Please don't trash Austin, there are trashcans everywhere, take a few seconds and just throw it away...

His girlfriend was thankfully unharmed, but on Sunday night Andrew died from his injuries at Brackenridge Hospital. I'm asking for anyone who saw or knows anything that they think might be related to please call the APD Vehicular Homicide Unit at (512) 974-8164

[KXAN.com link](http://www.kxan.com/dpp/news/crime/man-killed-in-bike-hit-and-run)

The cocksucker who did this was driving a dark-colored SUV southbound on S. Lamar at 11:44pm Saturday night when he killed my friend. I know its not a lot of information to go on, but maybe you know someone who fits this rough description... or maybe your neighbor just got a big unexplained dent in the front of their SUV. If you know anything whatsoever please call APD, or fuck, PM me. Thanks for listening everyone.

**EDIT**: Thank you all so much for listening and passing the word around. I realize that there is almost a 100% chance that you were no where near the accident and can't really help with information. I'm holding out hope that if enough people hear about the incident then perhaps someone somewhere might be able to contribute to finding Andrew's killer. Thanks again r/Austin, and please for the love of god, stay safe when you're riding your bike in town.",,False,self,t5_2qhn5,True,,,True,t3_gxh0k,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/gxh0k/looking_for_the_darkcolored_suv_that_killed_my/,

My e-mail provider suspended operations rather than spy on its customers. I was livid and did what any red-blooded American would: called his congressmen. I called their offices and read this message. I thought others might like to adapt the message and let our bosses know what we think.

Mr. ______ (Cruz/Cornyn/etc) 

I am an American soldier who has lost his desire to continue serving this nation which violates its supreme law. When I tried to log into my email account using lavabit.com last night, I was unable to, and now my service has been suspended because the owner is honorable enough to defend our constitution when you have not. Due to unspecified government inquiries he has disabled his service rather than infringe upon my rights. I urge you to disband the NSA until such time as reasonable safe guards can be implemented to protect privacy.

Privacy is a human right, not just an American right, and any claims of international communications negating this right are merely that: claims. The U.S. government cannot take away that with which I was born. In the words of Benjamin Franklin, ""Those who would give up Essential Liberty to purchase a little Temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""

Tomorrow morning, when I report for duty, it will be with a heavy heart and under duress. By serving tomorrow, I feel I will be violating my oath of enlistment. I have no desire to serve the disgusting beast this country has become.

A little less than ten years ago, the Army sent me to Fort Hood. After a couple weeks of in-processing and training, I was finally afforded a chance to leave Killeen. I had never been to Texas before and, at that point, all I had known of the state so far was a very crappy couple of town surrounding Fort Hood. I was not impressed.

Until I came to you. It was a cool December evening when a couple guys from my platoon brought me to you. And within 15 minutes, I was in love. The lights, the music, the atmosphere, the air itself, was enough to heal me in ways I never thought possible.

From that moment on, I made sure to take the hour long drive to you as often as I could. You were like a home I never had. I started dating women that lived in your limits. They showed me places my buddies would have NEVER found and I grew more in love with you every time I came. I played guitar by the Stevie Ray Vaughan statue on Town Lake (it will ALWAYS be Town Lake to me) and went to open blues jams on sixth street. Antoine's, the 311, Emo's, Dizzy Rooster, SXSW.... it all called me forth. And each time I drove south on 35 and saw the ""fortress of solitude"" staring back at me, a wave of ecstasy rushed over me and I knew things would be alright. Anytime I had a shitty week, I just came to you and you made me feel better.

And then I had to go home. I didn't want to leave you, but I had left the Army and had to go home to start the next phasce of my life. But the whole time I missed you dearly. I told anyone that would listen about your splendor and beauty. How you made me feel and how I thought you were, in the most literal sense, the coolest city in the entire world (I have traveled the world since then and still consider this an accurate statement).

And now seven years since I left Fort Hood, I look outside my hotel room and see you again. And it brings a tear to my eye. And though I'm only passing through for the night, I'm so excited to experience you one more time! And when I get back to Detroit, I know I'll feel just a little more empty inside because I had to leave you again.

 I have to hit the treadmill for a little bit, but I'll be roaming your streets within the next few hours. I know I'll feel the same way I did all those years ago.

I love you, Austin. 

----Scott

PS: My sincerest condolences on the passing of Leslie Cochran. That guy was awesome and he represented so much that is good about you.

Turns out the McDonalds had towed me because of FFFFest and hadn't warned Peter Pan they would be doing so.

Well I got my car out of tow myself and left my information to have the owner call me so I could seek reimbursement.

I just got off the phone with the owner who said, 'I'm sorry, that was our bad.' He offered to reimburse me with no argument whatsoever.

* Comfortable shoes.

* Flask. Bring one.

* Pay that chick 20$ to RSVP you to every party.

* Twitter will tell you about cool parties and celebs whoring themselves for attention. If you're into that, get an account and monitor it.

1. @sxfreenoms

* My recommended schedule is wake up at 11 or 1130am, arrive downtown at noon. Eat from food truck and then get into trouble. Party at pure platinum or another venue until 4. Go home. Repeat x 10 days.

* Movies &amp; Films are starting to outshine the music part the more popular sxsw gets. This is opinion. If you are into big time music acts (lil wayne, kanye, bruce, jay z etc) then this may be inverse and right up your alley!

* stay hydrated. many party venues have coconut water either free or for 1$. this is a quick path to rehydration.

* create a fake email address and a fake facebook account. some cool parties make you sign in for free admittance. you dont want to give up more of your privacy. use the dummy accounts instead.

* carry as few things as possible. cell phone. wallet. keys. flask. limit it to 5 and under so you dont lose shit. you're going to get drunk and probably high.

* have a good attitude. regardless of weather, sxsw is fun.

* the last weekend is harsh as everyone comes out hoping to find their rapper of choice. take the last saturday easy. 

* dont get overwhelmed.

* study the schedule and make some cant-miss events and stick to them.

* learn the movie theaters by default along with their cross streets. the austin dt naming scheme is easy breezy. rivers and numbers.

* there are free buses. look into them.

* bring an umbrella. you wont need it every day but you dont want to be trapped if it does rain.

* cash is king. dont carry more than 100$ in 20's at any time, though.

* there is a SXSW subreddit

* Traffic will suck from noon - midnight. If you brought\rented a car, leave it as far from downtown as you can manage. Train or pedi-cab if you can, bus or cab if you have to, car only if absolutely necessary.

* a bicycle is a very convenient transportation method when all the streets are shut down. It's almost a necessity during sxsw. double bag it though and use 2 U locks.

* Sunblock and chapstick are a must.

* Rest. Sleep is important

* Hydrate. Sodas and Alcohol DON'T count.

* Travel light enough to keep your lower back in shape

* Stretch regularly. This is Austin we don't care if you do Yoga in the street. It'll help keep us Weird!

* Take it in stride and chill out

* Meet 3 new people you wouldn't otherwise talk to",,False,self,t5_2qhn5,1361397014.0,,,True,t3_18w2nd,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/18w2nd/im_from_x_and_this_is_my_first_sxsw_tips/,

Pros:

* Cheap rent. $615 per month for 727 Sq. Ft. 1 bed / 1 bath.

* We're basically **paying you to live here.** We're refunding your deposit after 2 months AND letting you **keep ours** (up to **$200**).


Cons:

* The neighborhood. Located off of Rutland Dr. on Golden Meadow Dr.

This is Red Room, located on 4th street, aka ""the Gay Strip"".

From his facebook status: 
&gt;So on last nights events: Let it be know I walked out on my shift last night and am no longer working at the red room. They hired promoters and changed in too a straight bar in a night. They allowed their promoters door guy to state that it was no longer a gay bar and gays wernt welcome. I watched him send away countless gay men and drag queens away for ""dress code"" while letting straight people in who clearly were not in ""dress code"". No one was informed of a dress code proir the bar opening. I watched these hip hop promoters allow girls they knew in shorts and flats and men in shirts and hats that did not follow their supposed dress code. Also their customers wernt asked to pay a ten dollar cover like every gay person was asked too if they couldn't stop them for ""dress code"". My loyal customers and friends wern't allowed in and were turned away under a false pretense. I fought all night with management and owners saying how messed up it was that my community was no longer welcome. I was told to stick it out and that these were the changes and nothing was going to change. Fed up I went up to door when I saw even more friends and regulars turned away and heard the door man say verbatim "" this isn't a gay bar anymore you can't come in"". I was livid. I went to my owner and said that I understand they paid them but what was happening was wrong. When 80 percent of the staff is gay it was messed up for them to allow this and do nothing but shrug. I said I can't stand here and support this and I am loyal to my community and if they weren't welcome for being gay then I didn't feel welcome. I said I could not morally respect myself as a gay man if I continued to work and let it go. I was told if I was really that uncomfortable I could relieve myself for the night and attend a meeting today. So I did. I shut my bar down and left around midnight. The meeting never happened I was told I was being let go via a phone call and text message because I walked out on my shift. No apologies at all. I refuse to work for a company that allows discrimination against my own people or any one for that matter. I was chastized for being upset throughout the night. Their actions and lack of action showed me that neither the community, gay employees, nor myself were respected in the slightest. That we are replacable and our money wasn't classy enough for them to take.The promotion company only cared about making money but gay money wasnt good enough. I find it appauling that they would open up on the gay strip and tell us we are not welcome. I worked hard and enjoyed my time with them but last night made transparent the facade they have erected. It saddens me that a group of minorities would treat people with such blatent disdain and the employers did nothing to stop it. They didn't even hear my case and I was fired for standing by my community and and my own personal convictions.

There was a guy on a sport style motorcycle weaving in and out of traffic, and I thought ""What a jerk."" 

I was doing that thing where you exit 35 and get back on - which for whatever reason can chop 10 minutes off my commute.  The bike guy was doing the same thing.  

Right before getting back on 35 just north of 183, the bike rider cuts hard left, parks on the side of the on-ramp and dismounted his bike.  I was asking myself ""Ok, what the hell is going on..."" then I saw it.   There was a little red kitten on the on-ramp, about a foot left of the lane stripe, almost in traffic.  He was obviously scared, and was cowering.  

This dude I thought was a jerk was trying to save this kitten.  The ladies in the 2 cars behind him were stopped, and they both got out and acted as wranglers, and after a few minutes, he got the kitten.  (He got the crap bitten out of his hand for his efforts - lucky he was wearing gloves.) 

Mr. Biker took the kitten across the access road, and into a car dealership and released him.  I wish I could have shaken his hand - but he jumped back on the bike and roared off, weaving through morning gridlock traffic.

-You contact me
-I contact you Back

-You tell me a date and how many people

- We meet a day or two before hand to get groceries (or I can can get them and you can pay me back)

- I come to your house cook, clean and gtfo ( or stay and hang out if you want) 

How much is this? Well... to cover gas, time and my awesome skills it is all dependent on how many people you have. The more people the cheaper it is.

Just to let you know, npredney... I had made some Jalepeno cornbread previously and the al pastor with the extra green sauce, guac, and pineapple made for some crazy good leftovers! Thanks again!""

Theylookfine-""This guy is awesome. Surprised the wife with a candlelight dinner made by npredney. He keeps the mess to minimal (nothing), polite kind and professional demeanor, dealt with my two kids asking nonstop questions, and made a RIDICULOUS pork loin. And other stuff. Chocolate mousse. Amazing. 10/10 would eat again. Great guy, food tastes like freedom and the soul of Mother Theresa.""

I arrived on the scene literally thirty seconds after the perp took off.

A police report has been filed but I don't expect anything to come of that. Unfortunately we don't have much information but here is what we have:

-Black or dark colored SUV with damage to the front driver side. (My SO's car is silver colored so it is likely to have silver paint on the damaged area.)

-The middle most characters of the license plate are ""A"" and ""J"" in some order.

-Driver was a short, 4'-5', Hispanic man, estimated to be somewhere between 20-30 years old.

-Happened in South/East Austin in between Riverside &amp; Oltorf just east of I-35.

I'll post pictures/proof of the damage if wanted.

I won't be able to respond to any replies until approximately 3-4 pm CST.

Apologies if this is the wrong subreddit but this is my first post and I can't think of any other subreddits to put this in.

I appreciate it guys &amp; girls.

* **She is OK, whiplash and bummed, but OK**

Edit 1: Sorry for the late reply, this blew up way more than I thought, thank all of you for your time &amp; thoughts! Holy crap! Front page! (At least when I'm logged in :P)

Edit 2: More details on damage and location:

-Suspect was heading east on Woodland Ave and turned out in front of my girlfriend who was heading south on Willow Creek. He then fled north to E Riverside and I suspected took a right, I doubt he waited for the left turn signal. [Exact Location of incident](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=30.235433,-97.727392&amp;ll=30.235554,-97.726918&amp;spn=0.007758,0.009645&amp;num=1&amp;t=m&amp;z=17)

-The damage would be on his driver side bumper. Possible broken driver side headlight. Silver paint scratches and maybe black from her bumper. (Volvo so it is a real bumper)

-My SO did her best to make out the other car. She thinks it was a slightly newer Chevy.

But, in all fairness, he is a momma's boy. He's much closer to her and dependent on her.

So I took some time over the weekend, went and visited a few rescue locations (Humane Societies, TLAC, SPCA), and I met ""Duggie"" (his Humane Society of Williamson County name).

Duggie was a stray, and ended up spending about three weeks at HSWC. He's very skittish and shy; sudden movements scare him. I hate to imagine the cause for that reaction, but he has a couple scars, and his tail is missing. 
But his stump is wagging ferociously. 


http://imgur.com/a/NZx1U

I've renamed him ""Buddy"", and the first thing I did was to get him a long, luxurious bath to clean up the weeks of kennel grime. He met my friends' two dogs last night, and they were BFFs in a matter of minutes. They spent the evening tearing around their yard.

A special thank you goes to your Police, Fire and EMS folks. I know that you all worked your asses off this weekend trying to keep everyone safe.  The police took a pretty hands-off approach unless there was an obvious public safety issue and overall everyone was ultra cool.

On the cab ride home from the airport last night, the driver and I had an amazing conversation about life. He was a spiritual man who found peace in Christianity after leaving Iran and studying engineering in Germany, although his beliefs were more focused on developing a ""personal connection"" and he wasn't a member of any church. Although I am agnostic, I found his perspective on life to be refreshing and touching. He mentioned that he didn't make a lot of money driving cabs, but he liked it anyways because he got to meet different types of people and learn about human nature.

This afternoon, I got a call from my mom saying I accidentally left my change purse full of $200 cash in the cab. The driver, upon realizing this, drove back to the airport and reported the missing purse to airport security and let them open it to look through it for ID. I didn't have any identification in the change purse, so he looked up my payment information, got my name, and took the time to contact the UT police department (he remembered I was a student) to try and get it back to me. UT police called my mom and, long story short, I was able to call the driver and set up a time for him to come to my apartment and drop it off this evening. He refused to let me find transportation to meet him, since he knew I didn't have a car. He insisted that he bring it to me instead and save me the hassle.

I just got back to my apartment after picking it up from him outside my complex. I thanked him profusely and offered him a cash reward for his kindness and trouble. He refused to even let me pay for the gas it took to get there. Instead, he asked that I repeat the same kindness to others and donate the money I would have given him to charity.

He could have easily just kept my money and claimed he never found anything. But instead he took time out of his life and job to go through the lengthy process of finding me and returning it. I've never been so touched by such kindness from a random stranger. Even after going through all this trouble to do this for me, he continued to think of others and refused payment. It's sad that this isn't the thing I'd expect someone to do, but it just goes to show that there are still amazing, generous people in the world who care more about being a good person than making money. And I love that I run into many of these people in Austin.

I'm posting this here because I thought the story might inspire some of my fellow Austin redditors the same way it inspired me. I also wanted to get some recommendations for some awesome local charities that I can donate my ""reward"" money to.

Also, in case any of you are interested, the driver's name was Abbas and he works for Austin Cab Co. If you ever need a ride to the airport, I would STRONGLY recommend calling him. You're guaranteed a safe trip and a life-changing conversation. Feel free to PM me if you want his number :) It's the least I could do to repay him for everything he's done!

I saw a a girl stumbling in the street right by the HEB on Riverside.
It looked odd so I turned around to see what was going on.
I pulled over and saw a young lady with lacerations on her face, arms and chest, bleeding profusely.

She had just been involved in a hit and run.
I stopped and rendered aid to the best of my abilities and got an ambulance on the scene asap.
I hope she gets better soon and has a full recovery.

This isn't really my point though.

Driving through East Austin for the last year is like going through the fucking gauntlet.
I live near pleasant valley and I cant tell you how many close calls I've had with pedestrians on E. 6th and 7th.
Bar patrons nearly always wearing dark clothing spill into the streets ignoring the mostly non existent crosswalks. 

What gets my blood boiling is bad cyclists. People on fixies speeding down streets with absolutely no lights, no helmets and zero reflective clothing or bike markings.
This is bullshit.

Don't ruin my or anyone else's life, insurance, and vehicle with your inability to follow grade school rules of being visible and looking out for your own basic safety.
Obviously the last thing I would ever want to do is cause harm to anyone with a 2000 lb vehicle. 

Your style is not worth your life.
For fucks sake please be safe. Wear lighter color clothing, use lights and crosswalks to your advantage.
Thanks.

tl:dr Please don't get hit by a car by acting stupidly in East Austin.

EDIT: Please don't think I'm advocating anyone to drive like assholes and speed around social areas or anywhere pedestrians might be present., However, keep in mind the average speed limits on Pleasant Valley and 7th are far from safe for crossing without using a crosswalk with no visibility on your person.

This shouldn't be a drivers vs. cyclists/pedestrians debate.

Until proper lighting and crosswalks are installed the onus is on both parties to make extra effort to prevent accidents. 

I highly agree with
    
    **comehererightmeow**

    *I think the real problem here is the lack of proper lighting and sidewalks. I think you should send an email 
    detailing your experience(s) to the mayor or the council members and try to get them to fix the problem!*

I do plan on writing an email cataloging my experiences over the past year as both an avid cyclist and driver in the area. I suggest anyone interested should also get involved by calling 311 or sending an email [here](http://www.ci.austin.tx.us/council/groupemail.htm)

EDIT: Contacted City of Austin. Austin Energy is apparently responsible for city lighting. I was told I would receive a call back in 3-4 business days to see how to proceed further. I'm absolutely willing to take this to city council. I'll keep this thread updated for anyone who cares to follow.

Because of r/Austin's awesome [""Best Of"" posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/dks9k/a_list_of_the_best_austin_subreddit_topics_so_we/), we [ate an incredible lunch at Habanero](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/petm5/best_texmex_restaurant_in_austin/) on Friday afternoon, we were able to get some [awesome breakfast tacos](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/d4qcf/hey_reddit_austin_some_of_us_at_one_end_of_the/) at Juan in a Million and Torchy's, we [had a delicious burger](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/dfndb/what_is_the_best_burger_place_in_austin/) at Casino El Camino, we had [shots of Tito's with a pickle back](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/kjx87/best_downtown_austin_bar_for_grownups/) at Kung Fu Saloon and we learned to [stay away from the Salt Lick](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/csv6p/best_bbq_in_austin/) if we want some good BBQ - we ended up at Smitty's, which was a *revelation*. Hell, even [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/jlbu8/a_comprehensive_list_of_the_best_drinking/) pointed us towards some great Mexican food at El Caribe, just based off a comment in the thread.

Suffice to say, the organization in /r/Austin is fantastic and everyone involved - mods and subscribers alike - does a great job of keeping things new and relevant, not to mention helpful for out-of-towners like myself. I didn't have to bug you guys with inane posts asking where to eat and drink - the information was very clearly organized in the sidebar.

It's been almost 15 years since I stumbled upon a goofy MTV show called Austin Stories - my first chance to see just how unique and awesome Austin really is. In the words of the show's own [Howard Kremer](http://tombeckerphoto.net/gallery/photos/img/_live/live_kremer_2.jpg), ""Have a summah.""

Please share with friends for visibility - he's a great guy and this is pretty devastating.
---------------------------------------------------
PLEASE READ THIS: This is not an April fools joke. 

Last night my backpack and guitar were stolen from me before my gig at the Mohawk. The hard drive that is in that backpack has no back up. It contains all the music that I have been making over the past 2 years. It is not replaceable.

Too many people were in there last night for somebody not to have seen something. I'm not looking to press charges on anyone. The most important thing is that the hard drive is returned. 

If you know where my gear is, know who took it, and or you stole it and want to anonymously return it, log into this email account:

returnmaxfrostsgear@gmail.com 

password: austintexas

You can email yourself from that account where you have placed the items. Or tell me what you saw or who has them. 

This will be completely anonymous. 

That hard drive is worth nothing to you. You couldn't get much for it.
To me, it is my entire world. Please have some decency. 

Item list:
Dark brown leather gig bag
Cherry red Gibson SG
Dark green military style back pack 
Mac book pro with black case (only covering the top half)
M audio interface
SILVER HARDRIVE 

Please share this. Especially if you were at the Mohawk last night. 

Thanks again for everyone who came out. Sorry that I never got to play.

Addition: Also, I won't defend her stupidity in regards to not having a good plan on getting home. However, I will say that this simple act of kindness makes for a good example of why most of the people in this city are good folks. Her and I definitely had a talk about being aware of her surroundings and how she could have become a ""statistic"", but i imagine most people have had a time in their lives where you had to rely on a stranger for help.

Of course it all happened so quickly I couldn't see any truly identifying features or relay anything useful to the APD.  I was walking back to my car after a seeing a show downtown and as i was about a block away two black guys basically rushed me, they had hoodies on and blue medical gloves.  All that they took was my wallet, which had nothing of value other than my driver's license and debit card (which I just cancelled).  The police who helped me were there very quickly after being called, both on bikes, and after telling them where they ran one of the policemen rode off trying to find him.  He actually did end up spotting the muggers, but could not get to them in time as they were across the railroad tracks from him.  I am very thankful and pleased to say that these two policemen did an outstanding job, and were truly concerned with helping me.  My past experiences with APD have not been so positive, but these officers were extremely professional and I am very thankful for their service tonight.

So if there is any moral to this story, please be careful out there ya'll, I have lived here my entire life and assumed this type of thing just wouldn't happen here.  I'm not the type to promote carrying weapons at all, but always travel with a friend, especially late at night.

The happy ending to this story is there was a bachelorette party going on right across the street from where I was mugged, and they saw the entire thing and waited with me for the police.

Personally, I will be making my way out to enchanted rock to watch the shower from the top of the hill.

A description from  EarthSky.com:

The Perseid meteor shower is perhaps the most beloved meteor shower of the year for the Northern Hemisphere. The shower builds gradually to a peak, often produces 50 to 100 meteors per hour in a dark sky at the peak, and, for us in the Northern Hemisphere, this shower comes when the weather is warm. The Perseids tend to strengthen in number as late night deepens into midnight, and typically produce the most meteors in the wee hours before dawn. They radiate from a point in the constellation Perseus the Hero, but, as with all meteor shower radiant points, you don’t need to know Perseus to watch the shower; instead, the meteors appear in all parts of the sky. They are typically fast and bright meteors. They frequently leave persistent trains. Every year, you can look for the Perseids around August 10-13. They combine with the Delta Aquarid shower (above) to produce the year’s most dazzling display of shooting stars. In 2013, the Perseid meteors will streak across the short summer nights – August 10-13 – from late night until dawn, with little to no interference from the waxing crescent moon. Plus the moon will be near the planet Saturn in the evening hours, giving a colorful prelude to late-night Perseid show. Best mornings to look: August 11, 12 and 13.

As promised, here is what I have found out:

What is the timeline for installment in Austin?
Installation will start in 2014

Where will the service be provided? Is the coverage based on zip codes?
The phrase ""everyone within Austin"" was used.  That is all for now.

Which areas will see service first?
As in Kansas City, Google will be creating a series of ""fiberhoods"", and service will be installed based on demand, specifically the number of interested persons who submit their information [here](https://fiber.google.com/cities/austin/)

Will there be special incentives for local businesses or apartment buildings?
No word yet, but I am planning on looking into any precedents in Kansas City.

What will the cost of the service in Austin be, if it differs at all from the Kansas City pricing?
Pricing has not been settled yet, but the Kansas City pricing was used as an example.  Basic broadband product will be free.

There wasn't really a Q&amp;A at this meeting, but more information has been promised in the near future.  Hopefully the available ""fiberhoods"" will be released soon.  I already have another invite to a Google Fiber event tomorrow, more focused on local business.

**This was my original letter submitted to Twin Liquors on June 12th.** 


Dear Sirs, 

I've frequented your 107 W. Stassney location for longer than it's been owned by Twin Liquors... Now that I've established myself as a loyal &amp; qualified consumer of your fine spirits, I would like to bring something to your attention. 

The discontinued grapefruit juice in the large aluminum can is 1) bad for the environment 2) absolutely delicious mixed with any type of vodka (especially with a squirt of lemon)

Ruby Red, the item that replaced the real, canned grapefruit juice, has about as many calories per serving as the alcohol I’m mixing it with. It's loaded with sugar. . It's sweet like syrup.. not tart - like what someone with more arm strength would get when they squeeze a grapefruit... 

...and worst of all - I can't conveniently run to your store to pick up my weekend warrior supplies with hopes of rewarding myself with my favorite drink anymore. 

Here are my options. 1) move to a third world country with more pressing matters than environmental factors surrounding aluminum cans 2) help twin liquors find an grapefruit juice that comes in a biodegradable, environmentally safe container. 

Fun Fact - The ruby red grapefruit is the Texas state fruit. With this knowledge, I’m sure we (as in you) can create a strategic alliance and support local business at the same time - all the while providing your consumers with delicious, natural tasting grapefruit juice to mix with their vodka. 

As the famous pair in the Bartles &amp; James advertising once said

""Thank you for your support""

Regards, 

(Crackercortex)


**This is the response from their Product Administrator, today.** 

I could not help but feel touched, moved, and emotionally affected by the saga of your grapefruit juice quandary. Indeed, there had to be an answer.

It is true, we have chosen to no longer carry the cans. (For a lot of reasons, not just environmental. Most notably, the durn things don’t sell well.) But I completely understand the ruby red being too sweet; that’s what the product was designed for. It’s grapefruit juice for people who don’t like grapefruit juice. And I don’t think I could live with the responsibility of you moving someplace like Guatemala or Angola just to get your weekend tipple; there’s enough guilt in my life as is.

Therefore, I am happy to report that I have ordered a normal – unsweetened – grapefruit juice in a plastic, recyclable bottle, to be transferred to our Stassney store (along with many others) just as soon as it gets here. There is relief in sight, there is a light at the end of the tunnel, you will, once again, be content to sit on your veranda and enjoy your Greyhound in peace and security.

I know dogs go missing all the time, but the odds of him approaching anyone and they getting a microchip reader on him are slim to none. He was abused as a pup, beaten and tied to a tree and the chain was embedded in his neck. Dogs would attack him for his food and there was nothing he could do. He has a severe distrust for people, my friend was doing an excellent job of socializing him and giving him a better outlook on people. 

His name is Ziggy, and he is a sweet dog. Scared of everything but wouldn't hurt anyone. PM me if you see him or hear anything? We are desperate!

I tried to pay with my bank card, but the bank had put a hold on the card for ""suspicious fraudulent charges"".  Turns out it was just a waiter who apparently had a fight with a credit card machine and lost.  Sidetrack.  Anyways, I didn't realize at the time that the card was invalidated.  Instead of making me give back the food and make me figure it out by borrowing money, selling my soul, or some other inconvenient form of payment, they simply let me take the food and only asked that I keep them in mind for next time.  I tried to offer to come back the next day or something when I cleared up the situation with my bank.  But the dude behind the counter insisted it was alright.  

Next time you need your Chipotle fix, give these guys some love! This may seem like a small, insignificant act but it really made my day (and my tummy's day).  But lots of small goodness adds up to a large goodness. Thank you, that will be all.

It seems like the gents have a bunch of clubs focused on them with various age groups represented, but all I know about for the women is Lipstick, which isn't as good of a fit for me. Daytime, weekend places where there is likely to be a contingent would be especially interesting.

1320969496.0,114,self.Austin,m82b2,New Food Trailer on the Block!,Bluedogpizza,142,28,84,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/m82b2/new_food_trailer_on_the_block/,"Hello fellow Austinites!

Okie dokie. So, like the title says - we are a new trailer on the block (actually, corner of south 1st and Live oak) and we thought what could be a more perfect place to let people know we exist then the internets? (Both Husband and I are long term Redditors, just made this new account for our trailer!)

Our Story: We are a husband and wife team, mint out of the box from college (okay, so we're slightly used) who simply got tired of hearing the word ""no"" from every employer we threw our resumes at. In frustration, we looked to our collective talents and fell back on what we thought was the best fit for us - food. We're artists by nature, (and degree) and in this challenging economy thats pretty much a death sentence, so we made our check list this way: 1) what do people always need? 2) Is there anyway we can fit into one of those niches without going against who we are? 

Answer? Food. Food is the ultimate art form - it is art pursued and consumed by foodies and non-foodies alike day in day out regardless of the economy. Its the everyday art form, the one that falls by the weigh side in our to often hectic lives... I could go on, but my point is made. 

So Blue Dog Pizza was conceived. After receiving the rejection that tipped us just too far (three interviews for a job at an ice cream parlor that culminated in the text message ""Sorry no positions. If you're still looking for work by August let us know. :-)"" It was the final straw, and we pooled together what we had left and threw it all into one big trailer-shaped basket. 

I, (the wife of said husband wife team) have always had a passion for cooking, and in college learned that cooking for my friends was perhaps one of my greatest joys. I became something of a legend in our circle of friends for my food, in particular, my pizzas. I have been cooking my mothers pizza recipe for years, first with her and then on my own in college - by the time I graduated, ""pizza night"" had friends of mine clamoring for invites. It was from this ""fame"" my husband got the idea for our trailer and the rest, as they say, is history. (insanely brief history - but history non the less)

Our little trailer is in the South First Food Court on the corner of 1st and Live Oak and we're making pizzas 5 days a week (Tues-Thurs 11-9, Fri-Sat 11-10) for hungry folks who want to try something a little outside the box. We boast thin crust stone baked pizzas on a made to order basis, comprised of only the best and unique ingredients we could come up with. From our cheeses, (Goat cheese, Gouda, feta, Pepper Jack and more) to our sauces (Ever seen enchilada sauce on a pizza? Come check us out and take your taste buds on a journey) we treat each pizza as the work of art it is. We offer an excellent vegetarian variety (7 of our 8 main pizzas are either made just for vegetarians, or feature veggie options) and our dessert pizzas are, of course, totally veggie friendly. :-) 

So to end this incredible long, karma whoring (life whoring? does that makes this straight up whoring?) post, we just wanted to invite all you lovely Austin redditors to come out and see us - we love to meet new people (especially redditors!) and our lot is the perfect place to just kick back, relax, and enjoy some good food. We have a view of down town, and our lot is BYOB - what's not to like?  

Also, tell us you found us on Reddit and get a buck knocked off, BAM!!!!. That simple ""I would like a pizza, oh I found you on Reddit... "" BAM! Discount. just like that. :-)

Let me know if you all have any questions, and thank you for your time! :-)

TL;DR: Gen Y husband and wife team have opened a new food trailer over on the corner of South 1st and Live Oak that sells beautiful gourmet pizza on a made to order basis and they would LOVE to have some new customers! Also, mention you found us on a Reddit and get a discount! :-)   

Ps. screening Blues Brothers right now in front of our trailer! Come on by.

EDIT: Thanks to all the Redditors who have come by thus far with your kind words of encouragement and ready smiles - you made our day! also by request...

He's looking for ways to increase business during the summer while students are away, so I suggested giving a discount to you awesome Redditors.

For the next week, until the 8th of August, visit YoCup Yogurt at 10700 Anderson Mill Rd, Suite 105, and mention Reddit to get 20% off daily, or 33% off during Live Music Night, 6:30-8:30 on each Thursday, when he brings in some local, family-friendly musical talent.

FYI, his prices are already way lower than chain stores at 39 cents/ounce. Flavors rotate through; if it's available, try the Red Velvet - it's my favorite. Hope to see you there!

I can also powder coat small objects and can paint anything up to large automobiles, so the finish if your desire is simple!

Why offer my services at a discounted rate to redditors, you ask? Because a snaggle-toothed she-devil has just cost me a LOT of money and I need to make some, very quickly! I also won't allow it to make me go back to work for the man when I'm enjoying my life and every day I live it... so I'd rather build cool things cheap and enjoy it than toil away for some corporate fatcat.

Austin police will not be filing charges against the driver who was shot at by police this weekend.

They never tell you to take all electronics out of your bag, tell you to leave your iPad in your bag, and if anything that could not be mistaken for a laptop, but is of comparable size with lots of wires, is going to get searched. This doesn't seem to happen in OKC, SAN, PHX, but it happens every time in AUS.

Well, this time, it was a DSI Tempest drum machine, because I am living out of a hotel for a few days, and I wanted to work on some new music. They tell me They're going to need to check the bag, and I go and stand off to the side while they open it up, fumble around in it, and put it back on the rack. I'm legally blind, so at no point after they took my case, was I able to keep full awareness of what they were doing, but they NEVER said ""OK, you're free to go."" They put my bag back through the conveyer belt, didn't tell me they had done so, and didn't tell me it was on the end where other people were picking their stuff up, where I finally found the case, zipped up, and ready to go. Not a single word from the TSA agent from the time he said ""we're gonna have to recheck it."" They just sort of trailed off. This whole circlejerk was just enough to hold me back enough to miss my flight, so I grabbed a precious chair-next-to-an-outlet WAAAY over at Gate 20 and started digging around in my case for my iPad charger, when I immediately noticed something much more substantial was missing.

I immediately got up and burned through the ridiculous distance between Gate 20 and the security check point, thinking I was gonna go to jail tonight for my baby. They still had it, it was in a tray like the ones people put shoes and laptops in, and I hear the throwaway comment that ""they weren't listening."" which i can only assume was for my benefit, but no one really stepped up and owned this mistake.

I hate that we now live in a world of petty material opportunists who have sanctioned, government power to throw their weight around.

**EDIT:** Hey guys, this got a lot of traction, at least in this subreddit. I'm not ignoring, but I was flying to PHX on business and it will be a bit before I can reply. Thanks again for commiserating the TSA griefers with me.

My name is Andy Posterick. I am the Treasurer for [Test PAC, Please Ignore](http://www.testpac.org). We are a non-connected PAC **based out of Reddit**, which means that we cannot coordinate with Sheriff Mac's campaign. We are the same people that brought you Operation: Pull Ryan in Wisconsin. 

We are holding a public meeting in [our IRC](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=TestPAC&amp;uio=d4) tonight, Tuesday February 7 at 8:00 CST, to discuss Reddit's strategy to defeat Lamar Smith in *Operation: Mr. Smith Comes Back From Washington* (tentative name). Since we are a democratic campaign, everyone's input is valid. 

We've raised about $3,800, but are looking for *your* ideas about:

* How to raise more money quickly

* What to do with the money

* How we can utilize the student base at UT-Austin

If we want this to succeed, it is essential that we have input from people like you who live in the area. We don't know the demographics or the lay of the land, and would rather have your free expert advice than pay $.03 per voter from a survey company.

If you're interested in joining us, subscribe to our [subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpac) and come to the IRC meeting tonight! 

I will most likely be coming to Austin in the coming weeks to help coordinate things from there, and if I get a good enough response, we may have an Austin-area meetup to discuss ground-level strategies.

In the meantime, you can AMA about the PAC, the campaign and its plans, or my preference between waffles and pancakes.

1307939529.0,100,self.Austin,hy94m,I wanted to put a face to the woman who jumped from the Four Seasons.  She was my mother.,MMSFFL,122,22,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/hy94m/i_wanted_to_put_a_face_to_the_woman_who_jumped/,"Hello /r/Austin.  I read a couple of posts regarding the suicide that took place two days ago at the Four Seasons Austin.  The woman in question was my mother, and my family and I are still very much in shock over the incident.  She had left town to interview for a job in Austin, and I am sure suicide was the last thing on her mind when she arrived.  Unfortunately, my mother has struggled with depression her entire life, and, for whatever reason, something snapped that evening in Austin.  My mother was an amazing woman who bettered the lives of so many people.  The world is a worse place without her in it, and I will always love her.  

Edit: While I had meant ""put a face"" metaphorically, [here](http://imgur.com/nFFgu) is a picture of my mother. 

Edit Edit: Thank you, /r/Austin, for all of your kind words and support.  We are taking things one day at a time, and I know we have the love and support surrounding us to make it through this, even though that seems impossible at the moment.  For anyone doubting what I've posted, I simply don't have the energy to argue with you. Like I said, I only wish it to be known that she was an incredible human being, even though I'm hesitant to go into details of her life at the moment, and I couldn't bear to see her pass through Reddit as nothing more than a random individual.

Edit Edit Edit:  /r/Austin: I have a request.  I have been trying to track down anyone who might have spoken to or seen my mother while she was in Austin.  I am trying to get a sense of what she was going through while she was there.  Anyone you know who worked at the Four Seasons or elsewhere that might have interacted with my mom, however briefly, would be a tremendous resource for me right now.  It would mean the world to me to speak to anyone that can give me some insight into how my mother spent her last days, and I will provide my contact info to anyone who can help. Please
message me if you can assist in this matter.  Thank you again, /r/Austin.  ",,False,self,t5_2qhn5,True,,,True,t3_hy94m,http://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/hy94m/i_wanted_to_put_a_face_to_the_woman_who_jumped/,
