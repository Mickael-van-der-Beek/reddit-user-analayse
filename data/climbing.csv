[Example](http://www.theplaycoalition.net/projects/project_9/images/image1.jpg)        [Example](http://i.imgur.com/CGs5T.jpg)

 Would you like to see white mugs that are all the same shape, or one-off kinds with earthy tones? Also, upvote this if you are interested so I can see how many we would need to make. Thanks!


**EDIT:** Wow! This has gotten out of hand fast. I will be making a prototype today and doing some durability testing on it this weekend. Come Monday I will bring it to work and talk to out our rep to get a quote on a bulk order of these. They would cost too much to have them all handmade by my friend. What would be a good size number to start with? 500? 1000? I'm thinking after material and labor it would work out to around $15 plus shipping, but don't quote me on that. I will update you guys when I hear something Monday! This could actually turn into a real product in a few days.

1350547332.0,338,self.climbing,11ohze,I really think rock climbing saved my life. ,Lunaceres,400,62,91,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/11ohze/i_really_think_rock_climbing_saved_my_life/,"I've dealt with depression and an eating disorder for over seven years now. It makes day to day life very hard and there are many days where it feels like things are never going to get better, that life's gonna permanently be this downward spiral of failed suicide attempts, depression, starving myself and puking up everything I eat. Within the past year, things got a lot worse and I found myself not eating, getting very very sick, and this in turn made me even more depressed. I didn't honestly think I'd survive the year. I hit one of the darkest, lowest points in my life and it didn't seem like there was ever going to be a way back from it.

I found climbing on a whim about eight months ago. A friend had invited me along with a group to climb, and I decided to give it a shot. My first wall was a 5.6. By the time I got to the top I was shaking violently, vision tunneling out, barely holding onto the wall, convinced I was going to be sick. Then I looked down, realized I'd climbed a 65 ft wall, and felt more accomplished than I had in a while. That one day of climbing turned into every weekend, if not more times a week. I quickly realized that to climb, you needed fuel. I started eating again in a somewhat normal manner, knowing I couldn't climb if I didn't, no matter how much I didn't want to. The depression lifted somewhat, and got easier to cope with. I found something to focus my attention on and found that I truly loved rock climbing. It gave me something to hold on to and something to work towards and I found myself climbing harder and harder walls without getting sick. I got stronger. I got healthier. Things are not perfect and I've had a lot of bad relapses since I started climbing, but climbing has made things so much more bearable and has made life so much better. I fully believe that were it not for rock climbing, I wouldn't be here today. I'm just thankful for the community I've found and what a wonderful sport this truly is, and I just wanted to share the impact that climbing has had for me. It's really such an important part of my life now. ",,False,self,t5_2qk72,False,,,True,t3_11ohze,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/11ohze/i_really_think_rock_climbing_saved_my_life/,

He was setting an anchor to belay from. For some reason, he was untethered at one point. He slipped, and slid over the side, falling ~50 meters and dying on impact. 

I'm in a really weird space right now and cant think straight. But I wanted to say this. 

No matter how experienced you are, no matter how sure you are of your skills or how sure your footing seems to be or how many times you have done something in the past, or how far you think you are from the edge,  ALWAYS anchor yourself to something. [Buy a PAS.](http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pas_personal_anchor_system.html) [Become best friends with the clove hitch.](http://www.climbingtechniques.org/clove-hitch.html) And make sure you hold your friends to the same standards. Please be safe, guys. This was an easily avoidable accident that I can't stop replaying. Please learn from this. 

If anyone has ever experienced anything similar and is wiling to share their stories, or ways to cope, either via here or PM please let me know. I'm in a really weird space right now and could use all the help I can get. 

P.S. Im purposely being vague about the details, so don't ask. Things need to be dealt with properly first.

P.P.S. If you are ever feeling down, eating a huge amount of Taco Bell might seem like a really good coping strategy. Take it from me, it doesn't end well. 

Edit: It's really helping reading all the kid words coming in. I love climbit, you guys have always been amazing to me. I look forward to reading more in the morning. 

**UPDATE 1/17/2012:** 

So I'm holding up pretty good. I bouldered yesterday and it felt good. I can't express in words how grateful I am for the outpouring of support and advice I have gotten from you guys thus far. It has been invaluable. And I can tell that some of you had epiphanies in regards to your own personal safety so in that respect, there is some positive that has come out of this. I can't stress enough being familiar with anchor systems. Find someone in your area who teaches it, either a private guide or your local REI (every REI does anchor class, usually monthly. It is worth the money). 

I just finished going through pictures I took during the trip, some literally minutes before it happened, so I could send it to the family. It was awful. But it made me realize something. To any of you who are photographers: *take. pictures. all. the. time.* You never know when that picture you took might be the last picture ever. I know how much these pictures will mean for the family in the future.  

**UPDATE 1/24/2012**

Realized I haven't been logged into this username for a  bit. Thought I would give you guys one last update, in case any of you were curious. I talked to the psych, he thinks Im handling quite well. Ill check back with him again soon. I feel pretty good, and some good things have happened in the last week. I found out I got into my dream grad-school the other day. So all in all, Im doing good. I can't thank you guys enough for the outpouring of support. 



I doubt I will update this again. I hope to post an update with actual details about the accident sometime in the bar future, but I will most likely do it under my normal username. I will check this from time to time though.

Thanks again for everything. ",,False,self,t5_2qk72,True,,,True,t3_oin7d,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/oin7d/yesterday_i_watched_my_friend_fall_50_meters_to/,

* I have heard the garrulous chatter of late about the degradation of the quality of discourse in this fair community we all enjoy, so being a scientific man I was spurred to take action and quantify the alleged decay caused by barnyard creatures and their various textual bits of advice, and things of similar ilk.


 
* I reviewed the top 100 posts of the community and found *one*, again **one** post that utilized that tired schema of arranging text on top of stock photograph. Just the one.


 
 
* However, I found 3 posts (including this very one I write) with people decrying how this reddit was now full of trite trash.


 
 
* Those who would decry the quality of things posted here, you are in fact the problem with all your griping. You imagine you have an ownership over this community, when in fact you merely *participate*.


 
 
* Take heed though my noble fellow climbing enthusiasts, the solution is simple! If you don't like what you perceive to be the norm in the content of posts around here (Though at 1% I hardly think memes have become an imminent threat to the health of our dialogues) then post content of the type that you like to see!




 
* And furthermore, rather than limiting this community down and restricting what can be posted, use those handy up/down vote buttons reddit provides to move what you find of value to a place of prominence! Lastly, contribute that which you value, instead of denouncing the contributions of others!

Never forget how lucky you are.,detailorient,307,43,57,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/17fg6j/never_take_climbing_for_granted_enjoy_every_move/,"Yesterday when my buddy and I were packing up to hike back to the car, a lone climber was hiking in, and we struck up a conversation. He was a young guy, thin, and definitely looked the part of your devoted climber.

We struck up a conversation and it turns out this guy is very, very ill. I won't go into his medical details because it's irrelevant, but this guy has essentially been robbed of his health. ""I used to climb, but I've been sick and have had to take it easy for a while...""

After parting ways it immediately weighed on me how ridiculous it was for me to ever complain about shredded skin, sore hips, or it raining and making the rock wet. I couldn't get over the fact that 10 minutes prior I was in pseudo-anguish from shredding my finger and it actually seemed like it mattered. That shit doesn't matter, I'll be back next time at 100% and this guy is dealing with doctors and a medical crisis and can't even get out of the house except a few times a year. I felt like such an entitled brat.

It's amazing how a short conversation with this guy really put my whole life/climbing in perspective. I'm sure some of you are a lot more mature than me and are thinking this is obvious, but I think it's worth reinforcing the fact that health and climbing are not privileges. They are luxuries and can be taken from you. We should all appreciate our sport and what we are allowed to do everyday because of our health, because we are truly lucky.

To the lone climber trying to get back out on the rock for the first time after being weakened by illness, or to those currently struggling with their health, I wish you the best and I hope to see you crushing one day.",,False,self,t5_2qk72,False,,northdakota,True,t3_17fg6j,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/17fg6j/never_take_climbing_for_granted_enjoy_every_move/,

Me and my partner are from Austin, TX and went to a trip to colorado to climb for  week or so, and had our first stop at shelf road, south of Colorado Springs. Me and my friend being from sea level and with my friend VERY sensitive to altitude (it was only 5,500 feet or so), he felt symptoms of altitude sickness the day we arrive from Texas to shelf road, The symptoms passed and we decided to go climb as long as he felt fine. We climbed 5 or so routes in the 5.7-5.11a category with no issue, until we reached a 5.9 crack that I wanted to try out, that the guidebook said was 80 or so feet tall. The rope we had was a 60m elderid rope that had been cut on the ends a few times due to wear, the issue was that my friend wasnt certain how much had been cut off. He guessed about 6 meters or so, but just to be safe we tied a stopper knot before I started climbing. I sent the route without issue and called take and weighted the rope. I felt the normal sensation of being lowered for about 10 feet and then all of a sudden I accelerated to a free-fall. Surpised, I looked down as I was falling and saw that the ground was awfully far away and approaching awfully fast. I fell long enough to see that the ground was what seemed a few feet away and realized that this was it, this is the end, this is the last that I will see, I'm going to die. It was then that my stopper knot caught in my belayers ATC and jerked me a pant shitting 5-8 feet short of the ground equal with my incapacitated belayer who was in turn pulled up. 

What had happened, is my belayer belayed me from a sitting position due to the easiness of the climb and when he stood up, the lightheadeness from altitude sickness that he had not informed me about, caused him to pass out cold and lose control of his rope. Lesson learned that stopper knots cannot be ever neglected, and sometimes gri-gri can prove useful (if rarely). Still in shock about the whole sitaution, and how closely I came to my end on a simple single pitch sport climb. Makes me appreciate life more and let y'all know to stay safe out there, and know to prepare for the unlikely. I'm lucky to be alive, next person may not be so lucky and had brought a longer rope, and as a result of pure chance have died.

Some friends and I were at Red River Gorge this weekend and we saw a lot of sketchy shit from a lot of climbers. Some new and inexperienced, some strong and making bad decisions. 

We climbed Fri/Sat/Sun and saw the following:

* A kid decking from 30 feet because his partner had never belayed (evacuated with ~~spinal injury~~ head/bone injuries)

* A guy's harness coming completely open on the wall due to him not doubling it back (lowered safely)

* A girl teaching her mom to belay while climbing, which if not for us stepping in would have ended in a similar manner to the other inexperienced belay above

* About eight million backclips

* Lots of helmets on the ground, few in the air

Please be careful. Please think about your decisions (girl above climbs 12s and should have known better). Please do gear checks and all the other stuff you take for granted. 

Seriously. Don't get hurt because of a stupid mistake. 

End rant. 

**Update** A lot of people have been curious about the kid that decked. [Muir Valley's news page](http://www.muirvalley.com/news---updates.html) has a quick update on it:

Posted April 22, 2013
 
* Great News! Update on the climbing accident. We've been told by the family and friends of the  climber who was injured last Saturday that despite broken bones, a head laceration, and a concussion, he will be making a full recovery.
 
Posted April 21, 2013
 
* A huge thank on today's rescue of a fallen climber in Muir Valley to all these folks: Muir Valley Rescue group, Wolfe County SAR members John May, Daniel Wilkes, and Isaac McShane; Mike Trabel, an ER nurse who assessed and treated the patient; paramedic Larry Little who took over as medic on the carry-out; and all the climbers who volunteered to help out with the challenging transport of the patient down from the cliffs, and we don't want to forget those heros in the helicopter. We're crossing our fingers for a good outcome for this patient. You're all the best of the best!

**ALSO** Please, please read [Accidents in North American Mountaineering](http://americanalpineclub.org/p/anam). It will wake you up fast.

Each week we also highlight some of the most interesting threads on /r/climbing for those who didn't get a chance to catch them on the frontpage.

1365773812.0,210,self.climbing,1c7dnx,Why I love climbing,kogus,228,18,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/1c7dnx/why_i_love_climbing/,"Recently we've seen a lot of ""what climbing means to me"" posts, with beautiful pictures of mountain landscapes.

I love that scenery, but it's not, in and of itself, the reason I love climbing.

Here are my reasons - what are yours?

**1 - It makes me mentally stronger**

Routes and moves that used to be intimidating are not, anymore.

The idea of falling is not scary anymore.

This carries over to other parts of my life, and I like it.

**2 - It makes me physically stronger**

Things that used to be very difficult are now easy.

Things that used to seem impossible are now reasonable goals.


**3 - I can see improvement**

Routes that used to be hard, are now easy.

Routes that used to be impossible are now hard.

Routes that are currently impossible are realistic goals.


**4 - The community**

Every gym, every crag, every time I have been climbing, the vast majority of people I've met have been enthusiastic and supportive.

Most of the people I meet are much better climbers than I am - but not once have I had someone gloat, or rub it in.

Instead, we talk about ways to be better at something we both love.

The fact that I literally put my life in my belayer's hands every time I climb builds a strong sense of trust that I think very few activities have.


**5 - The aloneness**

As fantastic as the community is, when it comes time to climb, it's just me and the rock.

I think the combination of an individual sport, plus a great community, make climbing fun.


**6 - The places**

Yes, the mountains are beautiful, and I'd be lying if I said camping and climbing in those beautiful places wasn't a big part of the appeal.",,False,self,t5_2qk72,False,,northdakota,True,t3_1c7dnx,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/1c7dnx/why_i_love_climbing/,

**Update 19 Dec 13:20 HST**

Thank you everyone for your support! As of today, Moke Jungle and ""The Arch"" have been officially closed. Signs are being pounded into the trailheads, and DLNR rangers are no doubt out to intercept anyone attempting climbing. 

Please continue to email and call. 

Here is the news release from Mike Richardson, owner of Climb Aloha: [\[Facebook.com\]](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ClimbAloha/permalink/10152311460415467/)

In true bureaucratic governmental fashion, on Sat 15 Dec, four people climbing at The Jungle were ticketed by DLNR officers, before the location was even officially closed. 

------------

**Original Post:**

The island of Oahu has three developed areas for sport and trad: Mokuleia, Makapu'u, and the Mokuleia Jungle Canyon. 

On June 11th 2012, a young girl with a group from the YMCA Camp Erdman was [critically injured](http://www.khon2.com/news/local/story/Mokuleia-climbing-wall-closed-after-falling-rock/cXxiqnK3h0ekVB3_48eTtg.cspx) by a falling rock at Mokuleia. The group was not wearing helmets, in violation of YMCA safety procedures. The day after, the area was closed by the state's Department of Land and Natural Resources (DLNR). 

In August, the DLNR [closed the Makapu'u crag](http://www.accessfund.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=tmL5KhNWLrH&amp;amp;amp;b=7903133&amp;amp;amp;ct=12116903&amp;amp;amp;notoc=1), a small area on the opposite corner of the island with little loose rock and no recorded history of injuries. 

Now, the DLNR is preparing to close the Mokuleia Jungle, a slot canyon not far from the Mokuleia wall. It is also preparing to forbid climbing on ""[The Arch](http://www.unrealhawaii.com/2011/04/the-arch/)"", a difficult bouldering spot west of Mokuleia. It's easy to imagine that bouldering may be outlawed outright. 

This is happening in a state where a person has drowned [roughly every single week.](http://hawaii.gov/health/healthy-lifestyles/injury-prevention/injuryinfo/drowningbrief.pdf)

There are not many climbers in Hawaii so support from the international climbing community would be greatly appreciated. This issue is relevant even if you don't live here. You may want to visit in the future, or you may just feel that climbing is a sport that all people should be able to enjoy. Furthermore, laws passed in Hawaii may be used as examples for other states.

The Access Fund has agreed to provide, at no cost to the state, one year of liability insurance for climbers while a more permanent deal is developed. The DLNR has rejected this proposal.

--------------------

If you would like to help, please take some time to contact a few people:

William J. Aila Jr., chairperson of the DLNR. Ask him why the DLNR has rejected the Access Fund proposal, and point out that you would be less inclined to visit the state if climbing is illegal, and that about 30 tourists (and 30 locals) drown each year, but no tourists have ever died climbing.

You all basically told me to STFU, no way, to just do it, and so I just wanted to let you know that I did.  I took my two boys to the local climbing gym the next day.  Result:  no one batted an eye, and it was so much fun!  For less than the cost of a movie, a friendly gal checked us in, and to my surprise, got us harnessed up (no problem with harness sizes) and taught me how to belay.  

The boys had SO MUCH FUN, and honestly, I didn't get to climb much because I was holding them the whole time.  But even so, it was so worth it, and I'm so glad we went.  And of course, they are natural monkeys and loved rappelling down the most.  They played hard for almost 3 hours and slept really well that night!

So thanks for giving me the courage and encouragement.  We signed up for an intro class &amp; hopefully I will get a chance to do some climbing next time :)

***EDIT: Thanks again for all the positive thoughts, you are a great community, and I love reading your comments.  Regarding the cost, the gym I went to only charged $5 for kids 5 - 7, and free under 5 (I have a 4 year old &amp; 6 year old).  I was happily surprised that they let the 4 year old harness up.  Just for comparison, movie tickets even for kids in my area range from $7-$12, then I have to deal with a wiggly 4 year old for 2 hours, so yeah, this was way more fun :)***",,False,self,t5_2qk72,True,,,True,t3_oxzr7,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/oxzr7/thank_you_rclimbing_i_wouldnt_have_done_it_if_i/,

I understand the ""well, it's reddit, memes are part of the game"" attitude - in fact, I have made that argument myself in the past - but it's kind of out of control. Especially with the addition of completely non-normalized flair (what happened to normalizing it to crag / discipline / using some sweet iconography? - the random approach looks like complete ass IMO.) It kind of seems like this is the real r/climbingcirclejerk.. and the r/climbing of yore is nowhere to be found.

There's one serious technical conversation on the front page and it has 7 upvotes.

My suggestion is we flip the sub to text-only. This would significantly cut down on the amount of bogus shit that gets posted, raise the level of intelligent discourse, and help everyone benefit intellectually and technically. Many other subs have had success with this approach (fittit, askscience, etc.) - it filters out the people who just want to click on links, hurr-durr-hurr to themselves, and continue on their merry way.

We could all be better climbers together.. or we can have the same tits and cats that every other gutter subreddit has. IMO, it's out of control.

We need Reddit's help to raise awareness. #‎IranianClimbers,aliesna,259,86,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/1irapr/three_iranian_mountain_climbers_have_gone_missing/,"On July 18th, the three Iranian climbers went missing on the way back down form the Broad Peak, Everest mountains. Mass media has turned its back to this issue and Iranians are trying to bring attention to this urgent matter. REDDIT, PLEASE, WE NEED YOUR HELP.

Please Tweet and raise awareness about the issue. You can find updates at http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/. 




Efforts are being made to reach and rescue the three Iranian climbers stuck near Broad Peak Pass at 7800m; exhausted and without water, food and shelter. As per Iranian website KoohNews, unfortunately, all attempts made so far have been unsuccessful.

Contact was made with Aidin Bozorgi, this morning at 0600Hrs. As per him, they are feeling like crippled men and are unable to move.

Two Pakistani porters, who reached C3 yesterday, went up today, early in morning. At 0800Hrs, they were seen approaching the pass, but unfortunately they returned to C3 at 1300Hrs. The Porters were unable to locate the stranded climbers.

Meanwhile, help is being arranged from other teams in the region. Swiss K2 climbers, Mike Horn and Fred Roux, are on Broad Peak now. They were approaching C2 at 1300Hrs. The Iranian Mountaineering Federation is in contact with Pakistani officials and Sherpa in the region to accelerate rescue attempts. Heli-search is out of question, as the Askari Aviation helicopters cannot go beyond 6500m.

Long hours and stuff breaking at work, trouble finding a place to live in a foreign country, some other bad news here and there, and a plethora of minor inconveniences.

Overall, it's been stressful and busy enough that I skipped climbing entirely for about a week or two.

I forgot how important climbing can be to help remind you that some things — ground, sky, wall, and rock among them — can be counted on even during tough times. It's great to help put things in perspective and, like any exercise, it has a wonderful calming and soothing effect. After bouldering today, I feel so much better than I have in quite a while.

So just a reminder, even on those weeks where you're busy as hell and everything is falling apart and you're stressed to the limit, try to find the time. Climbing can focus you and relax you, and give you the energy you need to tackle all those other problems.",,False,self,t5_2qk72,False,,,True,t3_y84n5,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/y84n5/just_a_reminder_remember_to_climb_even_when_youre/,

School age kids are going on spring break, adults with time off work (climbers work?) are heading to the southwest for cold and dry. This is my favorite time of year to climb...so why wont the weather cooperate!@?@?@ I am heading to Hawaii mid April and when I was booking the trip I was astonished to learn that cragging is currently illegal there...wtf?? Apparently there was an issue with the way liability on public land works there, basically the state had ultimate liability when it came to the safety of people engaged in recreational activities. Thus they decided that it was in there best interests to ban climbing. A bit heavy handed don't you think? Especially considering people drown there while swimming in numbers on the order of something like once per week, pretty much forever. Here's the good news though: [The Access Fund](http://www.accessfund.org/site/apps/nlnet/content2.aspx?c=tmL5KhNWLrH&amp;b=5000939&amp;ct=12764911) (an organization you should get to know and do your best to assist) is working with Hawaii local climbers to bring some sense to the situation. If you have been following this space then you might already be aware of this issue. Nonetheless, I wanted to draw your attention to [this link](https://www.change.org/petitions/hawaii-senate-pass-sb1168-relating-to-limited-liability-for-rock-climbing) which is to change.org's petition to keep climbing legal in Hawaii. If you can do your part by clicking it now and then clicking Sign that would be great. There are 25,000 + climbers on this subreddit, and they need as many signatures as they can get.

1351606554.0,124,self.climbing,12c6m0,"As requested, my review of a new rock ring style training system: SICgrip's G-Strings.",kram115,132,8,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/12c6m0/as_requested_my_review_of_a_new_rock_ring_style/,"As promised, here's my review of the [SIC grips G-Strings](http://sicgrips.com/HOME.html). They were $59.95 plus shipping which is a little pricey. Shipping was relatively quick; I ordered them on the 23rd and received them on the 29th, so that included a weekend.  I'll go through the construction, ease of use, hold variety/difficulty, and end with a few tips and my overall opinion of them. First let's look at [what came in the box](http://i.imgur.com/65JtS.jpg). There are the grips themselves, a little pamphlet with pretty much all the info from their site, a little business card size hold position sheet, and some stickers!


**Construction (8/10)**

The holds are well machined and it seems a lot of thought went into the design. Since they're aluminum they're fairly lightweight but I don't think they'll ""disappear"" into your bag if you're travelling with them. The nylon cords are nice and stiff ([here](http://i.imgur.com/49RiF.jpg) you can see them standing up on their own), which ""makes them easier to hang and allows them to hold a given position better."" The grip surface is very textured and feels like somewhere around 80 grit sandpaper. I tried to get a [picture](http://i.imgur.com/l8zng.jpg) showing the grit. From my last post there was a lot of concern about the holes cutting the cords. The outside of the holes are [chamfered](http://i.imgur.com/WfIlp.jpg) so there's less of an edge, but as far as I can tell the inside is not chamfered at all. While I was testing them, there are certain positions where the cords are against the grip surface and will rub. I didn't really do much on them, just tried out the different holds for maybe 15 minutes and [here](http://i.imgur.com/M0864.jpg) is what the cords looked like afterwards. UPDATE: I talked to SICgrips and they said this kind of wear is normal and will not affect the functionality or strength of the cords.


**Ease of Use (6/10)**

The grips are held in position using a prusik knot. [Here's](http://youtu.be/rB9dvGxpuTk) a video showing how easy it is to adjust them when they're not hanging. Adjusting them while they're hanging high above your head is a different story. I hung them from a pull up bar and had a pretty hard time rotating the grips around. If I hung them lower it might have been easier and I ended up just taking them down each time I wanted to adjust them. One major downfall inherent to this type of apparatus i.e. two separate holds, is getting them to be the same height. When I received mine they were pretty off and since the only way to adjust the height is to retie the knot at the top (not the prusik) it took me quite a while to get them level with each other. Also, since they are so adjustable it is hard to get both holds to be in the same position which could lead to muscular imbalances or over-stressing one arm. 


**Hold Variety/Difficulty (10/10)**

These are the most varied training holds I've ever come across. Since the G Strings are a spiral design, there are literally hundreds of hold positions since each degree of rotation changes the difficulty of each main hold position. Testing them out yesterday I can honestly say these are for everyone, gumby to pro. I'll run through each hold type.  

* Pinch

One thing most hangboards lack is pinches and if one does have pinches they're straight horizontal, which is not very ergonomic and personally usually hurts my wrists. Since the G Strings are 3-D adjustable you can make the pinches [angled](http://sicgrips.com/pinch_files/DSCF0887s-web-filtered.jpg) for maximum comfort. Also if you do choose the straight horizontal position, they can get pretty sick. Think trying to pinch rafters sick. There are three pinch widths too: [fat](http://sicgrips.com/pinch_files/DSCF0883s-web-filtered.jpg), [""rafter""](http://sicgrips.com/pinch_files/DSCF0782s-web.jpg), and [crimp](http://sicgrips.com/pinch_files/DSCF0797s-web-filtered.jpg).

* Jug

There are two jug positions: [incut](http://sicgrips.com/jug_files/Jug-new.jpg) and [rounded](http://sicgrips.com/jug_files/DSCF0865s-web-filtered.jpg). Both are super comfy. Not much else to say about jugs...

* Sloper

Here's where the golden spiral inspired design really shines. You can start with a super easy [full hand sloper](http://sicgrips.com/sloper_files/SloperSmallEnd-filtered.jpg) and rotate them until they're nearly [vertical](http://sicgrips.com/sloper_files/Sloper-hard-filtered.jpg); even the hardest of the Fontainebleau hardmen would have trouble with these! There's also a [sloping edge](http://sicgrips.com/edge_files/DSCF0893s-web-filtered.jpg) which again can be rotated until it's physically impossible to hold (unless you're Adam Ondra probably).

* Edge/Crimp

Mentioned above there's a sloping edge which when rotated positively yields a flat edge and an in-cut edge. This edge can obviously be made more difficult by reducing how much of your fingers is on it: third finger joint down to one and since the edge is rounded it's easy on the tendons. The crimp is nice and rounded as well and like all the other holds is adjustable from [two full joints](http://sicgrips.com/crimp_files/DSCF0351bs-web-filtered.jpg) to [half a pad](http://sicgrips.com/crimp_files/DSCF0355bs-web-filtered.jpg). The crimp can also be used to replace pockets/monos; just use less fingers, duh!


**My Opinion (B+)**

Overall I am very pleased with these and they seem like they'll be able to stay challenging no matter how long I use them/how much stronger I get. Having every hold type in such a small convenient package is really fantastic for someone who rents an apartment and doesn't like to have a huge chunk of plastic rigged to a door frame. With some light modifications the score can easily be bumped to an A+ (I'll go over these mods in the tips section) so unless you're a DIYer I might wait for SICgrips to release the next version if you're worried about the fraying of the nylon. Based on their prototyping history they seem to be pretty determined to get these right so I wouldn't be surprised if they release an update quickly.


**Tips**

* One problem I mentioned earlier was that they arrived uneven. However, I don't plan on hanging from these; I'm going to hang weights from them. I do enough pull ups and lock offs in my training so I want to really target my fingers and keep the strain off my upper arms and back. By hanging weights it doesn't matter if one is longer than the other and you can really be consistent with the load each session. Using them this way also solves the problem of them being difficult to adjust while hanging.
* I'm not sure how much it matters how the cords are positioned but I wanted to use them exactly how SICgrips specified so I taped the little business card hold sheet to the unused inside part of one of the grips for quick referencing.
* To prevent further fraying, I'm going to add a short piece of rubber tubing to the nylon and probably grind down all the edges.
* To solve the problem of reproducing a hold position I'm going to sharpie spots on the nylon corresponding to the location of the prusik for each hold I want to use.


For my purposes and after the above changes I will make, I give them an A+.

1340886176.0,113,self.climbing,vqjyl,My thoughts about the LaSportiva Futuras,McMa,127,14,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/vqjyl/my_thoughts_about_the_lasportiva_futuras/,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for this kind of article, but I find it a shame that there aren't many gear reviews in /r/climbing, specially because there seem to be a lot of people asking for advice to buy gear. I bought a pair of [Futuras](http://www.sportiva.com/products/footwear/climbingapproach/futura) about six weeks ago, and since there seems to be a lot of people wondering about this shoe (maybe because the NoEdge concept, maybe because of the resemblance with the Solutions or maybe because you really want to be sure about what you get when you pay 170USD (!!!) for a shoe) I thought I'd share my experience with you. Also I'm not exactly a writer and my mind is a somewhat-messy place, I think anyone will notice this while reading my text, so good luck!

**About me**

I have been climbing with both, the [Solutions](http://www.sportiva.com/products/footwear/climbingapproach/solution)  and the [Speedsters](http://www.sportiva.com/products/footwear/climbingapproach/speedster) (now broken :( ...) for about two years now, so I was very curious about this shoe that seemed to be a mix between them, and bought them on my last trip to Italy (where you can get LaSportiva slightly cheaper, yay!!!).

About the sizing: My street shoe size is 42.5, I bought them in 39.5, my Solutions are 40 and the Speedsters 40.5. They all have a *very* snug fit, specially the Speedsters. On the inside the Futuras look and feel much like the Solutions (maybe not as wide asa them), very comfortable!

I'm not specially strong, actually rather skinny. When I talk about ""strong feet"" I mean feet like mine which I use to barefoot climb most routes around 5.10 and lower. Take that into consideration...

So far I tried them in Frankenjura at rather overhung limestone routes around 5.12, in Val di Mello at very sharp granite boulders around V6 and V7, and some sandstone boulders in Heidelberg. 

**About the shoes**

If you have never climbed an overhanging route with the Speedsters you really should at least try it! It's amazing! the thin rubber allows you to practically ""grab"" the footholds with your shoes and the whole feeling is as magical as riding a manta ray in the ocean. (not that I have done that before, but you get the idea...) The Futuras don't feel the same, but they are still very soft and come closer than the Solutions and maybe than any other shoe out there. While I did miss that a little bit while climbing those overhangs, I was immensely thankful to have a ""thicker"" midsole (still the softest I have tried after the Speedsters (!!!)) when climbing vertical walls. Here they offer more sensibility than the Solutions, but much less support.  Their ""no-edges"" are surprisingly good at edging. Their only weak point is the round shape which is not as nice when it comes to pockets... sadly Frankenjura is full of said pockets and I still used the solutions to climb the hardest routes over there.

Until now the shoes seemed to me like a good (if pricy) compromise between sensibility and support for those of us who have strong feet. No big deal... and then you go bouldering with them! This shoes are amazing for bouldering, you can not only feel every single pebble under your feet (let alone edges) but really kind of kiss it with the tip of your feet. To be more clear about what I mean, you can feel and stand in some footholds too small for you to see. Other than having a very stupid and counter-intuitive name, this ""no-edge"" concept is a great idea and it really works!
Their heels are alright, but not as great as in the Solutions (which is my non plus ultra when it comes to heels). More like any other LaSportiva or Scarpa model. 
After feeling them on longer routes I did not expect them to be this precise and stable so I was greatly surprised! really had a great time bouldering with them and I think the same would apply to red-pointing longer sport routes, which I rarely do. 

**All in all... (tl;dr)**  

...this is not a mixture between two climbing shoes but rather a tame version of the Speedsters. Is that a good thing? I don't know, they work for me... if you have strong feet (read ""STRONG feet!"" don't want any of you writing hate messages wining about cramps in your foot archs) and don't mind disregarding them a bit, they might make a very good all-arounder for harder climbs and boulders. If you heavily regard on stiff shoe edges or climb a lot of pockets then you might want to consider something else, Miura VS, FiveTen Anasazi or Scarpa Vapor V, might be a good option. 

Hope at least someone found this helpful! Me... I would love to hear the opinion of other people about this or other shoes.

---

**Update:** Thanks to all the support, SB1168 successfully passed its first House committee hearing! We're now waiting for the next hearings to be scheduled. 

---

Thanks in part to the support of \/r/climbing, SB1168 successfully made it through the Senate. Now it's on to the House. The bill will go through its first House hearing on Monday at 9:30 AM HST. Please help Hawaii climbers get their crags re-opened by submitting supporting testimony. 

**There's no account to make, it can be done in less than a minute, and anyone can do it!** Thanks to the Internet, submitting testimony is nearly as easy as submitting a reddit comment. If all 25,750 members of this sub submitted testimony, the bill would be passed in a heartbeat. But that's not going to happen, so I plead: if you read this, please go ahead and submit testimony! Do it for me - I haven't climbed outdoors in over six months!

Thank you!

It would also be helpful to email these representatives. Hit 'em right in the tourism dollars: say that you won't visit if you can't climb!

[blogspam warning]",rift321,126,16,74,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/vfve2/in_which_i_give_up_my_job_car_and_apartment_to/,"A while back, [I asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/nuxi3/i_plan_to_quit_my_engineering_job_in_six_months/) how many of you would be interested in a blog about quitting your job, and staying on the road for a whole year.  Well, I put my two-week notice in last week.

While there isn't much to look at yet, I wanted to offer my friends here in /r/climbing a chance to watch things unfold from the beginning.

If you want to check it out, it's at [Travels With Taylor](http://www.travelswithtaylor.com).

I'm going to apologize in advance to the professional dirtbags out there, who are probably giggling at my feeble attempts at becoming a climbing bum.

~~I'm going to keep a running tally of my bank account, so people can get a sense of the costs you may run into along such a trip.~~  *(Edit: We'll keep track of expenses, but for safety reasons, we're going to keep the bank account balances to ourselves for a while.)*  I'll also make a bunch of [hopefully enjoyable] videos along the way, when there's something interesting to shoot (I could make some super-boring videos right now of life in Worcester, MA).

Feel free to criticize or suggest things.  I'll probably monetize it if/when it is not entirely pointless to do so, but for now, there's nothing I can gain from posting this.  Also, if there's a rule against posting this, I'll happily take it down.

Doing something like this seemed overwhelmingly risky, and a generally poor career choice, but on some level, I felt like I had to do it before I became totally entrenched in my life here.

My girlfriend and fellow traveler, Elena, also made huge sacrifices for this: she gave up what was essentially a dream job, managing a quickly-growing, successful rock gym, where the owners offered job security and ample vacation time to keep her around.  On the principle of wanting freedom to see things and travel, she decided against that kind of security.  I know a lot of folks do these kinds of things, but for me, the very idea of it was novel and pretty scary.

Taylor, by the way, is my wonderful dog.",,False,self,t5_2qk72,1340766597.0,,um,True,t3_vfve2,http://www.reddit.com/r/climbing/comments/vfve2/in_which_i_give_up_my_job_car_and_apartment_to/,

Over this past summer I started to get depressed(I would rather not share why). I thought it would go away if I just shoved it into the back of my mind. All my good friends were on vacations so I couldn't really get outside and hangout. I would wake up and just sit in my room, feeling like death was better then living in this personal hell. I started to behave different. I never laughed anymore, I never smiled, I had no feelings what so ever. My best friend came back from vacation and took me to a climbing gym. It was there when I finally felt something. I was able to get my mind of all the negative things ,for a short amount of time. Which was a miracle for me. I also met a girl who I found beautiful. I bought a membership the day after, and started climbing almost every day. I started climbing more so I could feel good. I started climbing with this girl and had a blast. She stopped coming after a month, but I fell head over heels for rock climbing now. It's been five months since I last felt sad. I can't explain how much I love climbing. I've met some great people and made some great friends. I'm less shy and even have self-confidence with women. Climbing is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me and I doubt I will be giving it up any time now.

I'm hoping this serves as a lesson to people starting to climb outdoors that it's important to know who you're climbing with and what they know, and also to learn how to check their work yourselves.  To some people the technical aspects of this sport can seem tedious and overwhelming compared to climbing itself, but it's just as much part of the sport and its important to become a student on these subjects; read books, take classes; discuss with experienced climbers.  If you're taking a party out and you are the ""experienced"" climber then be confident of your knowledge and how you're applying it each application.  If you have any doubt about an application of your knowledge then back away.  It's still too early to tell what happened exactly, but it's definitely an anchor failure and most likely a result of human error rather than gear failure.  It's really sad to see this happen to a first time climber who had no way of evaluating who she was climbing with or fully understanding the risks involved.
