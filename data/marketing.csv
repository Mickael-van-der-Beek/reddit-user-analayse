1365525939.0,169,self.marketing,1bzygs,Here's the marketing plan I use... Also AMAA,PablanoPato,208,39,85,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1bzygs/heres_the_marketing_plan_i_use_also_amaa/,"A couple of days ago /u/Diamons asked if someone had an actual marketing plan they could see [link to OP](http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1bu3ns/anywhere_to_read_actual_marketing_plans/). I offered to send him mine if he PMed me his email. Well I received about 200 PMs over the past couple of days and decided everyone could benefit from it. So sorry for being a couple of days late on this, but I wanted to make it anonymous and presentable for other people. I also decided to do an AMAA for anyone that had any questions. If you have any feedback or ways to help me improve it, I would love to see your suggestions. 

[My Marketing Plan](http://www.filedropper.com/redditmarketing-plan)

Keep in mind this marketing plan is pretty unique to me. I've created several spreadsheets within this workbook to help me manage tasks related to specific events all the way down to my budget. It's by no means complete and and is always in progress. Tend to flush it our throughout each quarter as I get new ideas. Suggestions are welcome. If there is any identifiable info in there please help me remain anonymous.

**About the company and my role as a marketer:**
We are a B2B company that sells business management systems to small to medium-sized businesses. The people I market to are typically high level executives. Though our customers are bringing in at least $1 million in revenue, our sweet spot where we can provide the best service is for firms raking in $10-150 million. We host User Group Meetings in 4 different cities (plus one as a webcast) each quarter for multiple products and other types of Lunch &amp; Learn style events as well. I am the only marketer at my firm responsible for planning 30+ events, managing the website, e-marketing, assigning leads and coordinating telemarketing efforts for the sales peeps. I do not have a degree in marketing so everything I have learned has been on the job. Before I started using a marketing plan I had absolutely no idea what one looked like. Once you get one in place and start using them it makes everything a little easier. I am by no means the best marketer nor is this the best marketing plan, but I'm more than happy to answer any questions about this plan or marketing in general. AMAA

**edit:** I should have noted that when you see certain things in my plan like a webcast or lunch &amp; learn, my marketing goes far beyond that. I know for those events that there is really much more involved than putting it on the calendar. Each event requires a landing page, multiple drip email campaigns, some require telemarketing or physical mail invitations, etc. You can definitely see how much I have to do for each event under the Event Planner tab. I originally used the Calendar that I provided to help me keep track of the tasks associated with each event, but have since started using my outlook calendar so that I get alerts for everything I need to do.

**edit 2:** 1 horse-sized marketing plan. 100 Spreadsheets would be a pain in the ass.

**edit 3:** I would be interested to see your marketing plans. If you have a plan to share please PM me so that I can send you email address. I want to see you you all manage your plans. 

**edit 4:** Thanks everyone, as a marketer one of the greatest challenges I face is Reddit. If any questions get asked over the coming days I promise to answer them.

There is a reason, like other professions, why people pay to go to school for marketing, and it's certainly not so we can create a free marketing plan for your business which you will use to make money or tell you, step by step, how to promote and sell your product.

Categories: Basics, Planning &amp; Tracking, Strategies &amp; Channels, Sales, Analysis, Other

1. Branding - Develop a crisp, memorable brand with your logo, motto (based on USP), website, colors, tone and other marketing materials. Defining your USP is crucial to this process. Important graphics such as the logo should be vectorized. Research and pay attention to discover if your industry's customers want a fun, professional image or something else. Create letterheads, business cards, uniforms, debrief/thank you packets and other paraphernalia to build your credibility. Distribute business cards to every employee. Consider magnetic signs for the main company vehicles. Use photos of employees and management to build personality and trust. Obtain a local or 800 contact phone number and email address. Free phone numbers for receiving calls are available from Google Voice. Based on this branding, you should have streamlined materials to give your clients at different stages throughout the relationship. 

2. Online Presence - List your website and contact information across free locations and register useful free products. These include: Yelp, Yellow Pages, Yahoo, Google, LinkedIn, Twitter (at least register name), Facebook (at least register name), Bing, Google Analytics, Google Webmaster Tools, Flickr, YouTube, LinkedIn. Connect the Analytics account to your website immediately to begin tracking all traffic. Join networks and forums related to your customers and begin contributing genuinely valuable content. Make sure your website collects emails through some mechanism.

3. Referrals - Plan/execute a referral strategy for your customers. This may include business cards, personal notes, special repeat-purchase deals, thank you notes, gifts, gift cards, a ""referral program"", continuous contact drips, birthday cards etc. Develop a relationship with important customers. High-quality work performance is obviously necessary. Be sure to repeat and emphasize that ""we rely on referrals for our new clients"".

4. Farmers Markets - A good stepping stone during the early development phase. Cheap (especially with DIY-labor), low entry barrier, offers customer interaction, repeated exposure to regular visitors, acts as an early feedback mechanism and is useful for developing a record of sales receipts or general traction. Generally requires a tent, table, chair, tablecloth and presentation/sales display. Ask customers to fill out questionnaires with valuable information such as grocery store shopping habits, email addresses and packaging or pricing preferences. Use this information for product development and to convince distributors.

If you’ve been subscribed for a while, you have noticed an increase in the number of spammers and a decrease in the quality of submissions. You are probably more than aware of the general discontent towards marketers on reddit and off as well. We are going to change that.

Beginning this week we will start a self-post only system as a trial for two weeks. Although no one has been abusing reposts for karma, we feel that this will require spammers to take an extra step or two when hunting for clicks. At the end of these two weeks we will have a discussion publicly and then amongst the mods and see if we should continue it. This is the first of many changes that you will see getting rolled out over the next two months. Among them: new sidebar, more affiliate subreddits, guides and how-to’s, recommended blogs and books, and some sort of FAQ.

What can we all do in the mean time? Simply submit good content and participate in good discussion. Please use the upvotes to let people know what’s interesting and save the downvotes for spammers or poorly done content. If you are going to criticize anyone, please be constructive.  Also, if you have questions or recommendations to improve r/Marketing please message the mods or post here. In short, just be awesome.

I thought we might start a discussion which profiles the average Redditor, in a snapshot. The average Redditor will...

Upvote:

- women with a cute face or big breasts, or both
- touching stories with an unlikely beginning but a happy ending
- women holding animals (the rarer, the better)
- most things depicting Obama in a positive way
- physically visible changes due to effort (i.e. fat loss)
- most things related to bacon
- posts exposing companies in bad practices
- old school video games or indie video games
- popular items/icons re-created or depicted by a Redditor
- socially 


I don't mean to over-trivialize it, but I don't follow every popular subreddit, so I may be missing a bunch of stuff, which I hope you might fill in.

The three best subreddits in which to advertise seem to be /pics, /gaming and /funny. So, what are some of the best ways to advertise on Reddit without getting caught (like Chobani was the other day)? 

Rule #1: Do not buy an account, no matter how tempting. Cutting this corner without integrating and understanding the community first, can be a detriment and may backfire in an unpleasant way [Thanks to Zazie_Lavender for pointing this out]

Rule #2: Have an account for close to a year minimum

Rule #3: Post regularly about other topics not related to your product, a competitor's product (basically let an intern spend a couple of hours on Reddit per day, interacting and doing some research)

Rule #4: Don't be obvious

Rule #5: Be honest

Rule #6: Attempt to create a forum, open for discussion [suggeested by wtstephens in the comments]

My thoughts on rule #3 are:

- product placement: create a post not centered around the product but rather one where the product is in the clearly visible peripheral -- possibly with a positive connotation attached
- competitive advantage: create a post depicting a competitor in a negative way, and provide a solution with your company/product (and maybe casually mention a few much weaker competitors just to make it even less obvious).
- self improvement: create a post stating that your company's product has changed your life in some way, the bigger (albeit also the more believable) the better!
- self deprecating (may be a bit risky depending on how your company/product is perceived at this point in time): take a fake stand against your own product and shoot down some minor/insignificant issues with it while making sure your logo is prominently displayed and indicating clearly where this product may be purchased
- experience: create a post talking about, or showing, a great experience you had with a company/product
- nostalgia: create a post about how you used to really enjoy using your company's product several years ago, and how fondly you recall those times
- emotional: create a post tugging at emotional strings (such as a wedding) with your product/company being clearly displayed
- controversy: is your product causing controversy lately? Stir things up by facilitating discussion as a current employee/customer taking either a positive or negative (playing devil's advocate or lightly trolling can be a good way to engage people in discussion) position
- an odd occurrence: set up an event which features your product in an odd, unlikely or unforeseen circumstance and post about it
- informational/professional opinion posts: whether made officially (as a company or an agent of the company) or discretely, professional input is a great way to get people's attention [suggested by wtstephens in the comments]

Any other ideas of which you can think?

Some major companies which I suspect are already advertising on Reddit, in a subtle and sometimes not very subtle way:

- WD-40
- Valve
- Oreos
- Accutane
- Facebook (?)
- Microsoft
- Nutella
- Chobani
- EA (?)
- Warner Bros.

That's about it. Would love to hear your thoughts/critique/input!

Edit: Forgot to mention there's a subreddit which I follow -- /r/HailCorporate -- which keeps track of obvious marketing blunders on Reddit. Some of the stuff they find is fairly subtle and sometimes hilarious. There are some good, if not brutal, lessons to learn there. [I figured this would happen before long.](http://www.reddit.com/r/HailCorporate/comments/xxrmk/iaman00b_discusses_marketing_on_reddit_in/) As long as we're being transparent about what's going on, I think everyone benefits.

Edit v2: [here's a post on the front page right now](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/xtoxc/wife_parked_next_to_a_yaris_same_color_as_hers/) which follows a similar pattern (going to add it to the list).

1) Stop sharing YouTube URLs. Share a PLAYLIST URL with your main video as the first spot in the playlist. The second video will autoplay, resulting in 2+ net video views instead of 1.  

2) Your title, video description and tags are HOTSPOTS for SEO. Start with your most important keywords first.

3) Put your title in quotes. Outside of the quotes, at then end, include your branding.

4) Copy and paste your title into the first line of the video description. Helps with SEO.

5) For help finding keywords, use https://youtube.com/keyword_tool. Your goal is to dominate the keywords that have a ""healthy amount"" of searches (7,000-30,000). You won't be able to dominate ""Business"" because the band Paramore has a song that is titled ""Business of Misery"" BUT you may be able to dominate ""buisness""... since it's misspelled and it generates 25,000 searches per month.

I also operate a couple facebook pages for client companies of an ad agency a couple doors down. What I'm noticing is people on Facebook have become extremely uninterested in having any interaction with business pages in the past couple years.

Since the summer, we've had development teams create custom facebook app pages (as per facebook's rules on contests), lawyers draw up contest rules and guidelines, and we've offered prizes totalling over $4500 in value where all people have to do is type in their name and email and hit submit, we've never had more than 5 entries in any of these promotions, despite running targeted (and general) ads, promoting posts, sharing on our timelines, etc. 

The weird thing is, however..whenever I link to one of my personal blog posts or upload a new photo I always get shares, comments, dozens of likes, and the counter on my site shows that some articles have been shared by people on social media sites many times. 

So is this just a regional thing, or are others finding the same? I feel like maybe people are being bombarded with so many companies constantly running ads and promotions that they've developed a kind of blind filter to it..and I'm not sure what else I can be doing. 

Today I launched a new promotion on my site where literally all people have to do is guess the item in a magnified photo and they'll win a prize valued at around 10-20 dollars, and I'm running this once every two weeks. I launched it half an hour before noon which I find to be peak traffic hours, and it's been seen a bit but no interaction whatsoever. I'm running out of ideas here.

I'm a psychology guy, interested in learning more about marketing. I have a Master's in Psych, where I specialized in Social Psych and Research Methods. 

I did some research in grad school that had a bit of marketing or business flair to it. Examples: Traits Online daters look for in potential Mates; The effect of college major and performance of running a business; Perceptions of Amateur and Professional Sports Athletes. I did a lot of research on users of fake online dating sites we set up for this huge study I did in grad school. So much data, I loved it.

I'm currently looking to broaden my career options by acquiring as much skill and knowledge as I can. I'm looking to perhaps enter consumer research positions or related positions one day.

Specifically topics like consumer behavior and analysis interest me. 

Is there a starting point any of you recommend? Any recommended texts or textbooks?

**Update 1, 6/1/13:** Thank you for all the wonderful suggestions. This is a great community with a wealth of knowledge. I am now reading two recommended books. (1) Predictably Irrational and (2) Influence: the Psychology of Persuasion. Both are really great reads so far, and I am thoroughly enjoying them. I am compiling an excel spreadsheet of all the suggestions for myself and for others. I will put a link here when I'm finished creating it for others to reference.

Since I began producing content specifically for Pinterest in the last month, I finally have a large dataset and understanding of users to study. To test the specific impact that a Pinterest-only marketing campaign can have one a site, my girlfriend Alaina was gracious enough to let me work on her sunglass boutique site which was only averaging 20-30 page views daily. With careful research on what, when, and how to submit to Pinterest I quickly began to take over the “popular” section of Pinterest and grow her site to over 100,000 visitors within the first month.

So what did I learn from these first 100,000 visitors and from a month of daily Pinterest marketing? Here are 6 simple lessons:

Lesson 1: Be Pretty: 

If you’re planning to submit a traditional infographic to Pinterest with the hopes of it going big (assuming it’s not about Ryan Gosling) then the graphic will probably need a redesign. I have found that with Pinterest, infographics containing light and visually appealing colors (such as light blues, pinks, and yellows) have far more success than those that keep their neutral layout.
Why is this? Once your infographic hits the “new” page in any specific category there is only a small 10 minute window for the content to be repinned or liked. If you’re a new user with a small follower base this method is your only chance at going viral. If it doesn’t happen, you will have to wait another hour to try the submission again (see my blog for the Pinterest algorithm update). Since Pinterest is a visual pinboard, it will be in your best interest to redesign the infographic to be as color coordinated and appealing from far away as possible. I have also found that including actual pictures as opposed to graphics works significantly better on the boards.

Lesson 2: Size Matters:

When submitting any graphic to Pinterest, this is the absolute biggest lesson that most marketers have failed to learn. My rule of thumb: if it’s over 5,000 pixels long, it doesn’t belong. Why is this so important? Because the REPIN and LIKE buttons are at the TOP of the submission. If a user has to scroll a mile just to see the entire image then it’s very unlikely they will scroll back up to press the buttons that really matter.
But not to worry, it is still possible to go viral on Pinterest with that monster of a graphic. To combat the “size” problem,  create a simple, square image in photoshop outlining the graphics title. Make it simple, pretty, and to the point. If you’ve been on Pinterest for any time at all, I’m sure you’ve seen the image to the left. There’s a reason for that.

Lesson 3: Perfect Timing:

When it comes to other social networks the timing of submission is somewhat arbitrary. However, Pinterest seems to stick to a daily schedule of when their users decide to crash my servers with traffic. That is why every single day I am at my computer ready to combat the eventual onslaught of what I like to call “Before and After Work Traffic”. 6AM and 6PM eastern time, every weekday, this happens. With the exception of Fridays, when the spike tends to hit at 4PM.

What does this mean? First of all, Pinterest users are very devoted workers. Second of all, the perfect time to submit your image to Pinterest is at either 5AM or 5PM. After a good hour of your content gaining momentum and traction within the boards your content will be highly visible during the peak hours.
There is a catch, however, in that lately Pinterest’s servers have been having trouble keeping up with the large influx in traffic during these times. If Pinterest seems to be loading slowly or is going in or out, it’s best to just hold off on the submission for another time.

Lesson 4: Honesty Goes a Long Ways

I would be a liar if I said I didn’t have more than one Pinterest account. As a matter of fact, I have several (all for science). The most successful account that I’ve had is a novelty account devoted to being a woman’s best friend. With this account I have never been negative or submitted anything to the boards, however, I just cruise the popular section handing out free advice and honest opinions. By doing this on the popular boards, with a novel name (I used a picture of Ryan Gosling just for the heck of it) I was able to establish over 100 followers within a week.
Just like on every other social network I can confirm that novelty accounts do work on Pinterest.

Lesson 5: Be a Creative Friend

Every morning when I wake up, I check the popular section to see what’s trending. It’s typically food ideas, some shoes, and a Ryan Gosling “Hey Girl” for good measures. However, every once and a while I will see an infographic of viral that made it through the pits to “Popular” page glory. If I see anything on the popular page that I think I would ever possibly make in the future, I make a note of it in my notebook and go about my business. The point is: I would never want to burden the Pinterest community with something that’s been done before.
Much like the other social networks, the users of Pinterest recognize copies or reposted material. While you may have some immediate success in the short run, a well thought-out and creative post will bring in 100x the traffic than cheating your way.
This also means, however, that your content will be submitted 9Gag at one point or another and repinned via Pinterest. This is bad because 9Gag is the mortal enemy to all original content creators.  I have found that by skimming the Popular boards on Pinterest every few hours for your content you will eventually run across an instance where your submission has been rehosted. I nicely leave a comment accrediting the original source and more often than not the Pinterest user edits the submission to the correct link.

Lesson 6: Don't Suffocate

This lesson is where probably 90% of the new businesses I see trying to make an impact on Pinterest fail. If you have a business account on Pinterest and someone has chosen to follow your pins, then chances are they are aware of your products have have visited your page to see what you have to offer. If your only plan with Pinterest is to only pin your products or images from your site, then chances are you will fail miserably.
A great rule of thumb I like to tell my clients is only 1 pin per day showcasing a product. The rest of the pins should be advice, insights, or something funny that relates to the industry and account itself. Whole Foodsnever pins any sort of products to their boards, and for good reason. They have chosen to remain true to their core values and only pin about:
 
Caring about the community and the environment
Promoting healthy eating and education to our stakeholders
Selling the highest quality organic and natural foods available
Creating ongoing win-win partnerships with our suppliers
By using this approach they have gained over 15,000 followers who follow them for what they believe in, not for what they sell.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_qbwth,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/qbwth/what_women_want_6_lessons_from_100k_pinterest/,

But this is the kind of thing that makes me wonder - I assume that a LOT of money was spent coming up with the name. When we chose our kids' names, we actually spent a lot of time going through abusive permutations to figure out how folks would make fun of them, to make sure there wasn't anything *too* obnoxious - it was very important to us. 

So how does Microsoft and their marketing firm miss ""XBone""? I have a strong suspicion we may see more people calling it that than the proper name. In fact I'm so certain of it that I'd wager on a name change before launch, especially if Microsoft fumbles the campaign on this as they've done so many times before &lt;cough&gt;Zune&lt;/cough&gt;

I'd like to get your feedback on what you think about content marketing. If you're using it in your marketing efforts, let's discuss what works and what doesn't. From my experience, I believe it does, but I think you get the best bang for your buck if you treat it a certain way. That's essentially what my blog post focuses on.*

*If you like it, pop on over to my blog and share the page. http://www.rhenwilson.com/2013/04/content-marketing-do-only-good.html.*

*Here's the full post:*

Last night, I tweeted about content marketing. I said that content marketing works so well because content marketing involves delivering goods and services that are much bigger than your product. If you're a company that sells potato chips, you can't expect to just to put bags on the shelf and wait for the trucks to drop off your millions. You need to create videos that speak to the potato farmers. You need a blog that offers unique and unusual recipes that involve your potato chips. Teach people how to grow potatoes in their own backyards. Invite them to visit your farm and experience the process. Once you start delivering goods that expand out from your original product, you provide a good much larger than just a bag of chips.

How can you make your customers' lives better? How can you provide services that enrich their lives, that make them advocates for your brand? Not just because they love the product, but because they love the company behind the product. You do it through content marketing.

You've heard the phrase, ""**First, Do No Harm**."" *Primum non nocere*. While an admirable rule, I find it lacking. ""Do No Harm"" is passive. ""Do Nothing"" might cause just as little harm as well.

As business owners, leaders, and marketers, we need to take this rule and flip it on its head. A business should strive to ""**First, Do Only Good**."" (Hell, everyone should strive for this!) As businesses, we should actively seek the good. Actively add value to people's lives. Actively ensure our clients or customers experience the good our business has the power to provide.

Content marketing thrives online because we're able to touch customers in ways never before thought possible. With that much power, doing good should be the only rule we need.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_1d3tl5,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1d3tl5/content_marketing_do_only_good/,

I work in the marketing departing of a well established distributor (not in the US). We've been handling a major brand and I took control of their Social Media not because it was part of my job, but because I saw that they were struggling, and thought I could help. So I grew their regional Facebook pages (from less than 100 likes to over 1000), made them Twitter accounts, and keep the fans constantly engaged through very active discussions (I'm a big fan of the product so that makes it very easy).


Now, the company has just won the distribution rights of another brand. It's a completely different category of products. This brand is new (worldwide) and even though their marketing budget is huge, they won't be spending any money in our region. They did however create a Facebook page for the region and they added me as an admin (content creator). 


The owners of our company basically want to use Social Media to raise awareness, without spending any money. All they've said is that I need to handle their Facebook page, link the Twitter account, and start getting likes. I received an email from the owner this morning asking if I had asked my friends to like the page. (I'm the only person working here that fits the target demographic which means that most of my friends do too). However, I don't want to spam my friends with another page liking request. How can I tell the owners that Social Media shouldn't be used this way and they need to actually spend some money on at least targeted ads to generate likes? 

Should I ask them for guidelines for the Facebook page (what kind of posts I should be writing)? What they aim to accomplish (generating awareness, provide customer service, engage the fans, etc)?

I put my faith into something very broad, having had little-to-no idea what I was in for. I still remember the fresh layer of naivety which glazed my eyes, and I can almost reimagine the feeling.

It was over a period of a year I understood I was learning more through mentors online than I was through the expensive formality of four to six classes a week. Now, in the end, I realize that school was simply preparatory for the interpersonal business world rather than to the growth of lucrative marketing methods and ideas. 

Had it not been for free marketing information, I'd probably be some bush-league marketing director for a company, making phone calls all day and relying on a $100-$200 weekly Adsense budget, and maybe using photoshop here and there.

Instead, the thousands of forum posts, PDF's, and people I've connected with have shaped the way I conduct business and develop ideas -- I was provided with a whole new perspective...for free! Before I go on, I'd like to say ""free"" is bad nomenclature for information, because with the amount of time I sacrificed learning every little nuance of the industry, I paid in persistence and motivation. Marketing isn't a website and a degree: marketing is the innovation of new methods and ideas and their successful execution. 

If you're like me, you can easily spend 30 hours a week reading guides written by someone with a level of expertise unbeknownst to you, and another 20-30 hours analyzing methods to figure out a) if they could genuinely convert and b) how to apply new twists and turns to one-up those already saturating the market. 

Almost everything you need to know is free flowing. It takes a lot of reading and trial and error to garner a cohesive understanding of the bits that comprise the current industry, and the mediums in which their application is executed will never stop growing. Had it not been for a few gentle hands, I wouldn't have the knowledge and motivation I do today. 

And speaking of motivation, the bottom line is this:
Even if you were to give out every method that composes your current business model, no one will be successful using them without the motivation you've had to get where you are today. Not everyone is a silver tongued devil that can sell SEO to someone who doesn't even know WTF it is. Not everyone can stress the importance of online visibility, or how one advertising outlet supersedes another in effectiveness.

Those who know what I'm talking about know exactly what it is to sell yourself. You can have a spreadsheet of facts, but at the end of a meeting, you're the character witness to your own success.

We have created a new type of search engine that searches on the full source code of webpages, not just the on-page text.  It's called NerdyData (http://nerdydata.com) and we're launching today!


What Makes Us Different:
Our search engine is different from search engines you've used before. Traditional search engines are geared towards providing answers, whereas our goal is to give you the best list of results for a query.


The Tech:
Our crawler has visited over 140 million homepages and collected terabytes of HTML, Javascript, and CSS code. We've also designed several search interfaces that allow anybody to query against the source code of webpages, or download a list of sites containing a specific term.

We even offer a search interface specifically for SEO's and marketers that allows you to search within specific HTML tags like meta descriptions and meta keywords.



What Can Our Tool Do:

-Help You Find New Leads (example: optimizely.com uses a js embed, you can find every single one of their clients with a simple search for ""cdn.optimizely.com"")
 https://search.nerdydata.com/search/#!/searchTerm=cdn.optimizely.com/searchPage=1/sort=pop

-Discover Trends (by looking at the frequency of how many times a keyword appears on a unique domain)
https://search.nerdydata.com/compare/#!/searchTerm=google,yahoo,bing,amazon,twitter/searchPage=1/sort=pop

-Research Backlinks Pointing To A URL

-Find Where An Image URL is Being Hotlinked 

-Developers And Designers Can Find Examples of Code Usage And Theme Use

...and much more


About Us:
We're Steven Sonnes and David Bielik, two 23 year olds who majored in marketing and recently graduated from Stony Brook University in New York, and we are ridiculously passionate about making search better developers, marketers, designers, and hackers.

So I'd like to ask you the following: 

* How rewarding is a career in marketing?
* Do you enjoy what you do, and what specifically do you enjoy about it. 
* What does your typical work day consist of? And how often are you working outside of normal work hours?
* How long/what does it take to reach a high salary in marketing, and what might that salary be?

I'm currently an accounting major, but I'm considering marketing. I will be honest, I don't wish to be rude nor undermine the career in any way, but I have heard that this major has been stereotyped as being easy and tons of people study it for that reason. I wanted clarification from people that have gone through it. 

* Now I wanted to know what a marketing job entails? I know it has to do with sales, but exactly what are some of the things you do?

* Do you see marketing high in demand in the future and hence meaning finding a job won't be such a painful process?

* I came to read somewhere, not my words just a random site I stumbled upon, that most companies don't value marketing majors because of the easy stigma it seems to have. Is that true?

* I know salary isn't the number one most important thing, but would you say you are comfortable with what you earn? (No need for specifics)  

* What are some skills that someone in marketing can have to make them stand out to employers? 

* Lastly, would you consider your job fun in any way? (Just thought this would be interesting question and I'm curious about the response.)

Anything extra you wish to add would be awesome and greatly appreciated! 

Thank you in advance for your time!

1367280048.0,22,self.marketing,1ddik9,My company is approaching our (1st ever) marketing campaign all wrong...what to do!,blackbetty57,33,11,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ddik9/my_company_is_approaching_our_1st_ever_marketing/,"Okay. I got a job about 1 month ago for a property investments firm. They've been around for 7 years and have doubled in size every year since, without any marketing. My job is to implement dynamic marketing campaigns, build company culture, direct our web presence, and help with the start of 2 additional business entities that my company will be forming shortly.

Our target market is primarily apartment owners, brokers and bankers. My boss wants our first campaign to be a direct mailer. 

Here is what I've learned thus far about what he wants:

- Wants a postcard and a letter sent out together
- Prefers they be HAND-ADDRESSED, as he feels they will be more likely to open and read the mailer.
- Wants the letter's content to specifically address:
- we locally own &amp; operate all of our acquired properties
- we are ready to acquire new properties
- we have a solid and stable history of success and growth
- that the decision maker can be contacted directly
- that we close quickly and have a shit ton of money ready to invest
-Wants to be portrayed as:
- family-oriented (partners are brothers)
- professional, but personal
- committed to local economic development

I don't feel we are going about this the right way. I don't understand the purpose of the postcard, save for a sickass design that makes us look like we care about our shit. I feel the letter seems rather intrusive and could put people off (""Hey we're ____ and we want to buy your apartment!"") considering that many of the people receiving these mailers have no prior relationship with us. I also feel that hand-addressing everything would make it look unprofessional or like we can't afford to do otherwise.

Help! This is my first campaign with the company and I really want to start off on the right foot!

tldr Boss has specific requests for 1st marketing campaign that I don't quite feel fits within our goals.

Edit: I have no problem with the mailer as a vehicle for this campaign. I guess I just feel like because this is our first campaign to get our name out it should briefly introduce us to the community and our target market, without flat-out telling them we want to buy their properties right now. I think there should be an initial ""this is who we are"" campaign and then a secondary ""we're looking to buy"" campaign. (Nobody in our industry sells to a stranger, it is necessary for us to build a relationship with each of our potentials, and therefore start with an impression that says I don't want to just take your shit and fuck it up for profit.) And if that were the case, then why not scrap the postcard and use it for the secondary campaign, as I can't quite see the use in it here. I am budging more and more on the hand-written aspect, as it is true that our target market is older. We are also preparing a social media / renovated website launch for the coming month or so, and I feel people will be more receptive to communicating with us if we begin our marketing efforts with an introductory campaign, also because it is very important to my boss that we show that we are local and personal and care about what is going through the minds of our target market. My boss wants to be a trusted advisor that others in our (local) industry can seek for advice and recommendations, with a solid reputation. If we blast ""I want to buy your complex"" in the beginning, I feel we'll get thrown to the wayside. Sorry this is such a longass post!

Edit: r/marketing, you are the best!

Update: Met with the bosses today. Gave 3 samples of postcards and 3 samples of letters. One of each was hand addressed, one of each was printed in hand-written font, and one of each was just printed in our standard font. He liked the hand-written the best, but decided on the hand-written font due to the time consumption (and for the sake of my office assistants!) of self-addressing 1,500 letters and 1,500 postcards. I definitely do think the hand-written is better, and am still considering just doing it myself all weekend. We had a long discussion about the purpose of this campaign, and the many options to achieve our goals. We've agreed to send out a letter with the same introductory theme, and then 5 days later we will be sending out our postcard advertising that we are looking and ready to invest in more properties. I feel this is a good solution, and will also allow us to better track and analyze these efforts. Ultimately, he was really happy with the options I provided and is super excited about the whole thing. Two hours later, we had a meeting with the partners so I could try teaching them to how to write seo-conscious content for our blog launch...where I got a promotion. Woot woot! Thanks Reddit!

After a decade and a half of consulting with companies of all sizes on their Marketing Communications efforts, we’ve gathered the top five missteps many companies make, and great companies avoid.

1) Decisiveness Can Be Your Downfall

Strong business owners and senior executives must make cunning and quick decisions since the path to success is littered with companies that were afraid to act then missed out, right?

Mmmm. Maybe not.

Sometime decisiveness can hurt you.  Rapid decisions made without feedback from your customers or key stakeholders can be a mistake.  Whether you are planning on pricing changes or new product launches, formulating these in the vacuum of the board room can spell disaster. Plus, it can create costly damage to your company’s reputation.

One of 2011’s more spectacularly tone deaf moves was committed by NetFlix announcing the plan to split the DVD and streaming businesses following a recent price hike.  And, “Qwister” than they could say goodbye to more than 800,000 subscribers and $9 Billion in market cap, the company recanted their plans less than a month later.

So what went wrong? For one, the company had been successful for more than a dozen years  with positive press shining on their faces each day.  Then they were unexpectedly pummeled by the storm clouds of negative coverage.

In The New York Times article from October 2011 under the headline “Reed Hastings Knows He Messed Up” the beleaguered CEO admitted,  “we simply moved too quickly, and that’s where you get those missed execution details.”

You can deploy focus groups, stakeholder interviews, or customer surveys  to secure feedback before launching new initiatives.  And, don’t forget to shop the ideas by your internal audiences as well.

This insight will help you craft your messaging and your positioning to help combat any negative backlash that may be coming your way.

And, even if you are a media darling today, take heed from Reed in his written statement regarding the price hikes, “In hindsight I slid into arrogance based upon past success.”

2) What Goes Up Must Come Down (Then Up Again, Hopefully)

We’ve all heard the old adage “what goes up must come down”  that most people attribute to Sir Issac Newton. Others say it isn’t from him, but regardless it’s a sound principle for this conversation.

In this 24/7 social media, real-time world, we can get caught in who is “trending.”  That is hype, and not something you want to build a long-term business strategy on or around.

We could conduct a graduate level class on the flops in the soda world from New Coke to Crystal Pepsi.  Many of these introductions enjoyed breathless teasers and per-announcements then tanked after the launches.

Despite the latest earnings dip and raised sustainability issues at their factories in China, Apple still remains a media darling of the moment. We should note that their prospects were not always so bright, and the company limped through the early 90’s.

Every heard of the Newton?  We haven’t either. It was one of the first personal digital assistants handhelds that couldn’t drag the company out of their doldrums.

Now if you believed the “hype” on Apple at that time, a Fortune February 1997 article on their purchase of Steve Job’s company Next Software said this. “You can’t justify it. Apple did precisely the wrong thing. Now the only future for the company is to get smaller and smaller until there’s nothing left. In fact, the only sensible conversation to have about Apple is the one in which you argue about how long it will take to die.”

The company said goodbye to Newton and hello to the iMac in 1998, and their prospects began to turn. Then faster than Steve Wozniak can appear on another reality show, the company under Jobs released a string of hits with the iPod, iTunes, iPhone, and iPad, and completely transformed how consumers “consume” content.

Want to know what Fortune says about the company today?  Well Apple was number one on their 2012 “World’s Most Admired Companies.”

The articles says “To say it was another big year for Apple would be a gross understatement. With the passing of Steve Jobs, questions swirled around the company’s future. But under new CEO Tim Cook’s guidance, Apple continues to prosper.”

The evolution of Apple is a company that was up, then down, then up again. Hype and positive press won’t pull you through because what goes up, must come down.

Remember, if your goal is to be the media darling today, then you better be prepared to be the media buffoon tomorrow.

3) Your Most Junior Employee Knows More Than You

Yes, you are well educated and brilliant.  Yes, you participate in very important high level meetings each day.  Yes, you review sales reports, financials, customer satisfaction surveys, and other important metrics on your company each day.

But, a scary fact is that your entry-level employees may hold more information and insight into your customers and front-line business than you. Sad, but true.

We’ve all heard of “management by walking around.” It is an easy thing to forget, but can be invaluable to your business.

Impromptu interactions with your junior staff can unearth invaluable information.  The trick is to allow them to open up in a productive way.  Ask questions and listen.  Don’t criticize or make them feel like “snitches.” If you do, they will clam up because no one wants to be the company “fink.”

If you haven’t watch at least one episode of the show Undercover Boss, then take a look at it.  The premise is that owners, CEOs, and presidents don bad disguises then secure an entry-level spot at their business.  The episode where the head of Waste Management attempted to handle the dirty job at his front-line was a classic.

The company leaders all learn that many of the programs they personally created don’t work in the real day-to-day life of their business. The senior leaders then leverage much of the insight they gathered from their time “in the trenches” to improve the business.

4) More Isn’t Always More

Most company heads are Type A personalities, which means they are ambitions, hard charging, goal oriented and always on the go.

So it can be easy to issue mandates and directives throughout the halls of your business as you cruise by to your next meeting.  Some leaders are just thinking out loud and trying to quickly solve problems, but unknowingly your junior staff may start scrambling to try to implement these ideas because “more is more” right?  Absolutely not.

Keeping a strategic focus on quality vs. quantity is important.

Starbuck’s comes to mind.  The company was founded by Howard Schultz after he visited Europe and enjoyed the coffee house experience that was non-exsitant in the U.S.

The company went public in 1992 and trained consumers  to expect to spend $5 on a cup of coffee while using a new language “venti, please.”  Expansion became the main focus with locations including drive throughs, which then positioned them against powerhouses like McDonald’s and diluted their quaint community coffeehouse price differential.

The years of 2007 to 2009 were not kind to them. The CEO took a big pay cut, profits were down 53 percent, thousands were laid off, stores were closed, and the company jet was sold. Wow, that was quite a fall.

So be wary of mandates and a “more, more, more” attitude that can cause your company to backtrack on past success, and take you away from your core competitive differentiators.  Remember that targeted strategy with complementary, qualitative communications always wins the race.

5) Waiting Isn’t Such a Bad Thing

O.K.  Just to warn you in advance, but you are probably going to hate this one.

You’re a hard charging leader and you want what you want … yesterday.

But unfortunately, many successful brand building endeavors are like gardening. They take time, water, fertilizer, and a little patience.  You can add some quick seasonal color to get you through your next quarter, but you still plant the seeds for next season and beyond. Now some of the seeds flourish, then unfortunately others perish.  (Remember the Apple example?)

While patience may not be your strong-suit, you’re in it for the long haul, unlike the dot coms of the late 90’s that were here and gone before you could say blockbuster IPO.

Remember Pets.com with the hand puppet mascot that appeared everywhere, including during a wasteful ad buy during the Super Bowl? Well they went bankrupt in 2000.  We could go on and on from that era, but you get the picture.

Now of course you have short-term sales projections and quarterly numbers to meet, but balancing this with the long-term viability and success of the company is key.

General Electric comes to mind as a stellar example.  It all started with Thomas Edison, and it became the world’s most valuable company under icon Jack Welch.

In a 1998 Business Week interview, Welch, the management guru and strategist said, ”You can’t grow long-term if you can’t eat short-term. Anybody can manage short. Anybody can manage long. Balancing those two things is what management is.”

So there you go, from Jack Welch himself, balancing the short with the long-term is crucial.

So, that $3.5 million for one 30-second Super Bowl spot just may not make sense for your target audience in the long run. Creating a marketing approach that does not jeopardize your long-term success for short-term gains is the essential.

If not, you may find yourself liquidating your assets   ̶   including your sock puppet mascot   ̶  which by the way is still available for purchase on eBay for $6.89 and up.

(xpost from /r/startups)",MrDNL,26,7,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/rn47r/im_selfreferring_1000_clicksweek_figured_id_share/,"Background: In June 2010, I started an email newsletter, [Now I Know](http://dlewis.net/nik), which shares a 500-word story about an interesting fact each day, M-F. I've grown it to over 40,000 subscribers over that time period.  I see the newsletter as a side project/lifestyle startup, not one where VC would make sense (or a $10mm exit possible). I'm always looking for new ways to get more subscribers, and what's worked best are endorsements -- basically, people telling others to check out the site. I've gotten a lot of subscribers from bloggers doing exactly that (and am glad to share examples if you'd like), and about a month ago, it occurred to me that I could probably put together a tumblr which would do exactly that.

Two weeks ago this coming Monday, I started the sister project, a tumblr called [Fact and a Photo](http://factandaphoto.tumblr.com). The concept is straight forward -- a photo and a related fact, published once a day. It's incredibly easy to upkeep -- I just need to keep dumping stuff into the tumblr queue whenever I find things.  The tumblr is in the same ""learn something new every day"" genre as the newsletters.

Fact and a Photo is pretty minimalist. There's the photo, the fact, and on the top of each page, the title of the site. Below the title is a description of the site, and then, in the same-sized text ""Want to learn more? Click here to learn something new every day."" The last sentence links to Now I Know's landing page, and occasionally, a post will have a link to a relevant Now I Know issue.

In two weeks, I've sent 2,500 clicks from Fact and a Photo over to Now I Know, with 1,000 or so coming in the last seven days. About half went to my landing pages, and it looks like 15% or so are converting, maybe 20%, but regardless, that's pretty typical for a vague endorsement. In any event, I'm getting about 20 new subscribers a day from my own (other) site.

As a bonus, this accidental strategy works like any other decent blog would, hopefully building upon itself as it grows. I'm at about 800 followers on the tumblr, and I've had little success in getting links from that medium previously. So maybe in time, I'll become my own biggest referrer.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_rn47r,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/rn47r/im_selfreferring_1000_clicksweek_figured_id_share/,

Any advice Reddit?,drumnation,26,8,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/wpfuu/enterprising_young_man_hired_for_sales_at_it/,"**BACKGROUND  ON MYSELF AND THE COMPANY**

I'm a young guy in my late 20's. Before I came to this company I was a freelance web developer for six years and have worked in IT sales as a hunter for many different start-ups in NYC.  Through these experiences working for smaller companies I've witnessed every aspect of running a business and have seen most of the modern methodologies behind sales and operations.  

I'm an entrepreneur at heart and a systems thinker.  I have always had a great passion for understanding every aspect of how a business works after I join a company.

I was recently hired by a small, mature, global organization with a fairly mature product line as a Sales Executive. I quickly realized that they had no marketing program (I know crazy right?) Sales have begun to level off in the U.S. (2% growth p/yr) and they aren't growing in France or Belgium anymore. (Likely due to the Euro Crisis) 

I know in order to be competitive they can't slink by anymore on antiquated operational systems, doing everything inefficiently in-house, and lacking necessary programs that we need to continue to be competitive. Despite this, the company deals with Fortune 500 and 1000 and still generates considerable profits (upwards of $10m per year.) Regardless of the clusterf***, this company is no joke. 

**""GOLDEN BOY""**

I've quickly become ""the golden boy,"" the young guy who plays with a smart phone, uses Facebook, reddits, and will inject some new life into the company. 

Most of the staff are much older than me and a bit out of touch with the information age. (Ex. One finger typing)  The CEO (73 years old) has listened to almost every suggestion I've had so far including things that cost money, so I'm in a very strange position of accidental influence.  

I want to make a difference here and I'm starting with marketing.  Some in the executive leadership have little confidence, if any, that marketing or the web can drive sales, so I am constantly butting heads.  All we have is outbound phone sales at the moment and the sales guys are having trouble due to no marketing support.

*tldr; Young guy with Web Dev and Sales background unexpectedly gets lots of influence and responsibility to update a mature company.*

**NO MARKETING PROGRAM – I’M MAKING IT**

Concerned with the lack of a marketing program and how it would affect my sales, I took a leap of faith and made the case that I should build a marketing program from scratch and my request was granted. 

I've never done this before, but having seen certain aspects of marketing from the sales side, and having a strong web development background, I know I can certainly do better than no marketing program at all. :)  

So far this has involved: copy writing, buying marketing lists, rewriting email copy, creating white papers, case studies, and brochures, rebuilding their atrocious website, and I'm in the process of implementing a CRM system/suite of cloud based productivity tools.  

I want to step it up to the next level and I’m unsure where to turn to educate myself.  I do not have a degree in marketing, but have absorbed many books and lectures on the subject.  I am currently listening to audio books and lectures by Seth Godin and Eben Pagan and others.  I’m learning great stuff but I am concerned that much of this is targeted towards small internet marketers and not the enterprise level. I'm interested in analytics, tests, and any other mechanisms or tools for going about the process in a methodical organized and almost scientific way. I know it's also a lot of trial and error too.

*tldr; Now I'm in charge of Marketing at the Enterprise level and need to expand my skills.*

**WHERE CAN I LEARN HOW TO BUILD AN ENTERPRISE LEVEL MARKETING PROGRAM?**

I apologize if this offends anyone who worked hard on their education in college.  I know I get a little ticked off when people tell me they want to learn web design like it's some easy thing to do.  I am an eager self learner though and have always been capable of mastering subjects by devouring as much information as possible.

In any case, I am interested in learning strategies and best enterprise marketing practices. If I can be confident in what I'm doing I can rally a decent budget behind my efforts.

Can anyone provide advice or resources on the topic, really great blogs to follow, maybe even some ideas for finding a mentor? 

I think I need more sophisticated strategies since I am doing this for a profitable corporation with huge clients and not a small start-up.

I’m looking to do everything: SEO, SEM, Social Media, Direct Mail, Email Marketing, Provide Support to the Sales team, Website Conversion, Lead Generation.   

How is this done on a larger scale? 

They are hiring an assistant for me soon and I want to be prepared with a strategy/plan and tasks for this person. 

Any advice reddit? 

Thanks in advance.  Love you guys! &lt;3

1337040503.0,18,self.marketing,tnbkl,I was recently offered a position that is way over my head and need some advice.,marketingnoob,20,2,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/tnbkl/i_was_recently_offered_a_position_that_is_way/,"Last summer I quit my job and took a part time job working for a small natural foods company just so I could have a little cash coming in while I continued my search and figured out what I wanted to do. I started out doing some very basic clerical stuff and even filling-in in production when needed.  

Within a month I was asked to drive a truck a couple times a week and do some merchandising. At this point I hadn't found any other jobs I was really excited about so I took the promotion and started studying for graduate school exams. 

There are only 3 people in the office and 9 in production. It's a really small company but we do about 1.5 million a year. Since October I've been asked do everything from quality control to payroll and accounts receivable type stuff. Needless to say, we all wear a variety of hats here. 

Two months ago I was asked to give sales a try and given a small raise. I had also put grad school on the back burner after taking the GRE and found another part time job at a small non-profit that was giving me some decent experience. I was fairly instrumental in getting out brand into a chain of 40+ grocery stores and was offered a full time position but with no raise and no defined role. For those reasons I declined and told them that I wasn't ready to give up my other job but that I enjoyed working there and that we could reconsider in the future.

Last week I had a meeting with the president and principal owner where he more or less asked me why I was so hesitant to accept a full time position. I was honest and told him my concerns moving forward and things I thought needed to be done to grow and improve as a company. The major point being that we need to devote more resources to marketing/events (this aspect of the company is virtually non-existent right now). At the end of the day I was called into his office and was given the following offer: ""I've thought about what we discussed earlier and would like you to reconsidering joining us full time. We have enough work for about two full time positions. That work consists of a mix of marketing, events, sales, and some general HR type stuff. I would like you to decide what it is you want to do, and we'll hire someone to fill in the other stuff"". 

I asked for a few days to think about it and came back with what I wanted to do (marketing and events), a formal job description, and the pay I felt that deserved. They accepted everything on the spot except for a slight disagreement in pay but it was good enough for me to accept. 

I chose marketing/events as the direction I wanted to go in because even though I have no experience I felt it gives me the best opportunity to grow my career. I am now the 4th highest person in the company and if we grow like I hope we do it will put me in a very good position going forward. 

**TLDR; I was offered a marketing/events position with a small company where I will more or less be the whole department and I have no experience.**

I start with my new duties next month and need some help. What are some good resources for me to check out in the mean time? Basically any advice I can get will be much appreciated.

Wanted to share my top findings in case y'all find it useful.

**Fly-ins/popups boost conversion**

I noticed a big jump in my conversions after I installed in a scroll-triggered fly-in window. This corroborates a lot of findings from other people who've tested similar tech, and here it is confirmed again. This should be a no-brainer test for anyone who's having conversion problems on their site.

Yes, fly-ins and popups can be ""annoying"", but they work.

**StumbleUpon Paid Discovery works, but...**

I paid $10 in StumbleUpon PD for my first blog post, which was expected to bring in 100 unique visitors. As of writing, it's driven 600+ so far. So it's been a big win as far as eyeballs are concerned, but the jury is still out there in terms of conversion.

Another cheap and easy test for those out there with stagnant numbers.

**Buffer is awesome**

A large part of my traffic comes from social (Twitter, FB, LinkedIn) and I have Buffer to thank for that. Not only do they automatically schedule your posts so they get max visibility, but everything is properly tagged in Google Analytics. bless those folks. I've used a lot of social media management services and Buffer deserves a look if you've not tried it yet.

I go into all of these in great detail in the full article below. I open the kimono and show you my blog's data, real Google Analytics numbers, etc.

Let me know if you think the list is missing anything major. Sorry for the lame default Wordpress and slight chaos on the page right now as I am updating things. I'll be updating and organizing the list today and throughout the weekend.

Most of the directories in this list are free, but some require payment. You should be aware that these directories have various verification processes that often require e-mail or phone confirmation, and these registration/verification/confirmation procedures often change (they don't want people building bots to automatically register thousands of businesses etc).

If anyone has any relevant business directories they think should be included and they want me to add them to this evolving list, please post and discuss your suggestions here. I started out with hundreds of directories and now I've got thousands of URLs to check and organize, so my apologies if the list contains a few dupes, is unorganized in places, and what not.

Most of the service providers' lists that they make public, I have found they usually only list a hundred or two hundred or so of the popular directories. I am trying to collect a much larger list and make it available to everyone that might find it useful.

I started doing volunteer work for a non-profit, and I was put in charge of managing their social media accounts. I've recently started looking at the Insights (usage stats) for the Facebook page I'm administrating, and honestly, I have no idea how to make sense of it. 

I have a knowledge of statistics, and as such, I'd like to be able to conduct statistical tests on the data to measure progress on our page. However, I have no idea what exactly to measure and look for, and resources I've found on Facebook marketing don't really touch this subject.

Some appalling examples.,Zoshchenko,32,17,28,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ixgtj/advertisers_seem_to_be_more_desperate_and/,"I can't believe some of the absolutely horrid crap national advertisers are paying good money to throw at the American public today. For example:

* I just saw a Cheerios commercial with a mom and little kid. They actually set up the premise that eating Cheerios in the morning is like having breakfast with the kid's dead grandma. Mom stars to cry.
* Wendy's set up a convoluted scenario in a spot where a guy is happy to get jury duty because there's a good burger joint next to the courthouse. When ""Wendy"" shows him a Wendy's burger he wants to get out of the jury duty by pleading insanity. Wait...huh?
* Miracle Whip did a take-off of The Scarlet Letter where Hester has a red MW on her blouse and through some stilted fake Old English dialogue try to establish that she shouldn't be ostracized for putting such a delicious condiment on her sandwiches.

It amazes me that some ""creative"" at the company's ad agency actually proposes these ideas, much less that somebody approves and funds them. The brains in the world of advertising seem to have shut down completely. I'd love to hear examples Reddit has seen that equal this level of desperate idiocy.

One month running, I think we have a winning format.",zemmez,23,9,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1ftucv/we_launched_a_news_blog_that_depends_heavily_on/,"Wife and I expanded a concept for delivering content-driven marketing. The promotion relies heavily on email distribution in a vertical market. We scraped email addresses to get things going &lt;-- yeah, I own that. I have a ton of experience in the area so I felt pretty confident about how to position the work for best response. 

We also rely on content aggregation for the work. No. I don't use source headlines or lede. I don't want to get into copyright trouble and be shut down. All sources are clearly identified with direct link back to the material.

We're only one month into the effort but things are looking great. 0.000% complaints from recipients. 5% unsubscribed. 5% new subscriptions. Net 0% on the overall distribution. 32% open rate holding steady. Click rate is steadily increasing - at 7% today.

I spent too many hours working on a responsive layout for the email. I wanted 3 columns, news style format. To be responsive, the 3 columns had to stack for smart phones. Yahoo &amp; Hotmail have their layout issues, but overall, it works. I'll continue to tweak the template now that things are going well. 

In the past week, I can't get my work done because I'm on the phone with the early adopters in an industry that is NOT receptive to new ideas or tech. All are excellent conversations and connections. 

At times, I get down thinking how much time I spent working on the responsive email layout. Out of fear that most our audience would be viewing our emails on Outlook 2010 on the desktops (making the time spent on responsive design worthless), I decided to wait to view the stats until I hit 30 days. I looked today and get to use Success Kid. [http://qkme.me/3ur1nq](http://qkme.me/3ur1nq)

In a completely unrelated vertical market, we use the same solution and have similar results. But that effort is international going to a wide variety of users. Still, iPhone tops the list at 37% of the opens... followed by Apple Mail (same thing, I think) at 30% of the opens.

I'm here to both brag and share: Your email marketing needs to be mobile friendly. It's what the world is using.

It turns out that people loved them. I went around the conference floor asking strangers to show me their finger. When they did, I put a LAZA KNITE on their finger and invited them to challenge their friends in a game of LAZA KNITEZ!! I was very glad to see that many people didn't remove them from their fingers and just continued conversation. Some people put them in their pockets or asked to see the other colors.

1350402250.0,14,self.marketing,11koqg,"I am Mark Gardiner, author of ""Build a Brand Like Trader Joe's"" AMA",TraderJoesSecrets,19,5,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/11koqg/i_am_mark_gardiner_author_of_build_a_brand_like/,"Q: You say “without advertising” but I’ve seen the ‘Fearless Flyer’, and they run radio ads in some markets...
A: Several times a year, Trader Joe’s distributes retail flyers to neighborhoods surrounding the stores, and it runs radio ads in some markets. Technically, even the hand-drawn signs in the store are advertising, but none of that is ‘brand advertising’. It uses an ad agency for help on its web site. In any case, as a percentage of sales, TJ’s ad budget is trivial. It doesn't even have an official Twitter feed or Facebook page.
 The proof that the brand thrives independent of that very limited advertising is that the Kansas City store where I worked opened to a frenzy of shoppers, before anyone there had ever laid eyes on a Fearless Flyer or heard a TJ’s radio ad.

Q:Trader Joe’s CEO Dan Bane says, “We’re a product-driven company” but you claim that the Trader Joe’s success is not the result of people just loving the products. How can you tell Trader Joe’s devoted fans that the brand’s not based on their favorite products?
A: Every customer is the final authority on on how much they like any given product. I’m just an authority on why they think what they think. The genius of founder Joe Coulombe was to create a cultural brand that colors the way customers evaluate those products. Bane says it’s the products, I say it’s the sliding scale they’re evaluated on.

Q:I hear Trader Joe’s is owned by Aldi...
A: Yes and no. Decades ago, the German brothers Karl and Theo Albrecht, who built the Aldi chain, split it into two separate companies. Karl owns the Aldi stores operating in Southern Europe and also the ones in the U.S. 
 Theo (who died a couple of years ago) owned the Aldi stores in Northern Europe. He’s bought Trader Joe’s from Joe Coulombe in the late ’70s. Technically Trader Joe’s is not an Aldi subsidiary, but it is owned by Theo’s heirs, who also own Aldi Nord. At the risk of causing confusion, Trader Joe’s and Aldi are direct competitors here in the U.S.; those two companies have no shared ownership at all. 
 
Q: Fortune magazine once ran a story about Trader Joe’s in which they called it “a secret world”. Another journalist once dubbed TJ’s, “the Freemasons of retail.” What’s with the secretive management style?
A: Back in the ’60s, Theo Albrecht was kidnapped and held for ransom. His family paid $12 million for his release, and that was virtually the last time he was seen in public. He turned his companies into secrecy cults. At the Trader Joe’s head office in Monrovia CA, where there’s not even a sign on building. The management’s instructions on what to do if a reporter shows up in the store are almost comically paranoid.

Q: If they’re so secretive, they can’t be too happy that you’ve written this book. Was getting a job there and then writing about them ethical?
A: When I applied for a job as a Crew Member in Kansas City, it was because the company was growing fast, and I thought there might be an opportunity for me to apply my marketing expertise within the organization. I didn’t apply to work there in order to write the book. In the beginning I made notes on my experience there because it was so interesting to me. I quit before I actually wrote the book. That said, I didn’t conceal the fact that I’d written several other books, so they shouldn’t be too surprised. 
 As far as Trader Joe’s was concerned, I was just a $12/hour guy hired off the street without so much as a background check, obviously, the company didn’t make me privy to its confidential information, so I couldn’t possibly betray its confidence. The book’s based on my own direct observation of Trader Joe’s customers, and the way they interact with and think about the brand. 

Q: Trader Joe’s brand seems laid-back, open, and wholesome. What are the company’s ethics like behind the scenes?
A: Trader Joe’s is definitely not a company like Patagonia, that strives for complete ethical transparency, but it’s not worse than most other $8 billion companies. On issues like farm-workers’ rights or the sustainability of fisheries, Trader Joe’s does what it’s pushed to do and usually acts when it’s been shamed in the media.

Q: What’s with the bells they ring at the cash registers?
A: It’s what we do, instead of using a public address system. One bell is rung to call extra cashiers. Two bells are rung when a cashier needs general assistance; maybe a customer needs carry-out assistance or someone’s dropped a bottle of wine. Three bells mean a manager is needed, for a return for example.

Q: What are your most- and least-favorite products?
A: Trader Joe’s strengths include chocolate, cut cheeses, and yogurt. The 89-cent sparkling water is a bargain. The store has a great selection of $5-$10 wines. The Triple Ginger Snaps are the crack of cookies. 
 Weaker offerings are the famous ‘Two-Buck Chuck’ wines - you should pay twice as much, even if it means you can only drink half as much! 
 I’m least impressed by prepared foods that are loaded with sodium, and with the company’s unwillingness to reduce products’ carbon footprints. Trader Joe’s sells Naan Bread that’s shipped frozen from India, and flies in hothouse tomatoes from Holland. 

Q: So, what is the secret to their devoted, almost cult-like, following?
A: It’s almost too simple to be true. The brand is the result of millions of face-to-face interactions between customers and Crew Members. Trader Joe’s makes a point of hiring genuinely friendly, extroverted people and they become surrogates for the brand. The customers shop there because they think, “It’s my friend’s store.”

Q: They’re growing fast. Will they eventually dominate the grocery business?
A: At the end of Build a Brand Like Trader Joe’s, I provide evidence that the current senior management don’t ‘get’ the genius of the founder, Joe Coulombe’s, original concept. If I’m right, it will gradually become just another grocery chain. Even if I’m wrong of course, the bigger the company gets the harder it will be to maintain that friendly, personal brand. That said, it can easily double in size in the next 20 years. When Theo Albrecht bought it, he made one of the best investments of the 20th century.

 - 2013 is going to be a big year for loyalty marketing
 - Use social media as a service channel, not just a promotional channel
 - Actually *learn* about gamification before blindly implementing it
 - Embrace the coming of the Post-PC era 
   - the example he uses is with payment (i.e use square instead of an ancient POS system)
 - Create value-adding experiences using mobile
 - 50% of brand ""likes"" have no influence on purchasing decisions

The article is worth a read because it has some interesting statistics in it as well as some pretty good supplementary materials, but I think it's missing a huge key point: do all of this **after** you have a solid plan that justifies *why* you should do these things and provides metrics that you can measure your campaign's success or failure against.

 - Buy N months of a product up front and get M free (where N and M are amounts)
 - Refer a friend and get something (although I guess that would be a referral program, not loyalty)
 - Provide information on sales a day early to mobile customers

I'm working in brand management/project management at a large financial company in the Western US.  I've recently graduated from college and got a job as a full time project manager.  I graduated from college with a liberal arts degree (psych) and am pretty happy that I have a job at all - much less a job that people have to work years to get into.  


I've been here a year and I'm getting pretty burned out. I'm constantly having to justify to management why I'm doing something, fighting for my ideas to get implemented, fighting with company priorities, and working with designers and engineers who build the projects instead of **actually** building them myself.  I feel like I'm responsible for everything, but responsible for nothing at the same time.  I work 50-60 hours a week not counting constantly responding to email after work. I would much rather take a lesser paying job and have more work life balance to take a more technical job - but that's because my understanding is that marketing is a pretty demanding and time consuming field.  I got into this industry because I saw a job opening, not really because I was actually interested in marketing (at all).

-----------

Any advice for a mid twenties recent grad that's considering a career change into something like software engineering, healthcare, or anything more technical?  Are these struggles that all marketers have to deal with and is what I'm describing above pretty typical?

I'd take a job that paid $13/hr and gave me spare time/my life back over a job that paid 45k where there's no work-life balance (and can afford to do so).  But - maybe every job is like this and I'm just naïve.

1. Did you catch that for some reason they actually used two different student photographers? Since they pretty much made the same commercial twice with no difference other than the guy's name at the end, probably not.
1. Did you get that one of the ""cool"" things about the photo shoot is that he was able to shoot stills AND video?
1. Or that he uploaded the images somewhere (no clue where) before they hit the ground?
1. They also hired one of the world's best skydiving cinematographers to shoot the thing. He doesn't come cheap.

I realise that setting up my own blog/website would be one way to go about it, however I don't really have any niche interests that I think would be worth talking about!

Long story short, I spent most of college exploring economics and finance but just realized I actually enjoy business, especially for the consumer products industry.

2)How is product management different than brand management in CPG?

3)Most BM jobs require an MBA, is there a way to get in without an MBA?

 I had a great deal of fun with this project, researching how different types of customers would react to the product I was assigned, discovering the best ways to market it, I even went so far as to set up a website for my project. Now, I have a chance that I could change majors without really extending the amount of time I spend in school if I switch to a business degree with a minor in IT(SInce I already have all of the requirements for a minor in IT I may as well tack it on.)

 Given the enjoyment I had during this project, would you advise me to change to a marketing degree? Is this the kind of thing I would get to do with marketing?

I work as a night time clerk for a small hotel in Amsterdam (around 30 rooms). Some days ago the manager approached me with the proposition asking me whether I could create a bigger online presence for the hotel's brand. Being the IT guy for the hotel (among other things) I was really thrilled to be offered such a project, because before this I would just fix computers and small network problems. I understand that for a lot of you this would count as peanuts, but for me it's really big.

Now I haven't graduated in marketing, but I do know that certain (relevant) things increase the potential to be viewed by a lot of interested people.

So I'm thinking I could do the following:

* Create a Facebook page of the hotel.

* Create a twitter account.

* Integrate both in the hotel's website.

* Make ads with Facebook's ad campaigns.

* Improve SEO of the hotel's website / fb account.

* Update the blog regularly with interesting and relevant infotainment.

* Get more active on travel sites (no experience in this personally).


So if there's anything you'd like to add or give advice about I'd be really happy to hear.

I say ""marketing it is difficult"", but I guess I should be saying ""I have no background in marketing and feel like I'm missing out on some pretty simple stuff"". 

We're currently developing a new website (that one was just a stop-gap) and we get most of our clients through AdWords. Our target market is:

* 30-50 year old men
* Predominantly single
* Usually in managerial positions
* Unstylish/don't read fashion magazines
* In a period of transition (single and want to make changes, got a new job, new to town, that sort've thing)

We're by far the most credible (and only) service like this for men in Australia. Our niche is that we're run by men (all of our competitors are women), and that we're young-ish (25) and have a buttload of experience.

It's a well-paying service with very minimal expenses, so we don't need a whole lot of clients to make a decent living (there are only two of us). 

Aside from targeting adwords (keywords like ""personal stylist melbourne"" ""personal shopping for men"" ""fashion tips for men"" ""fashion advice for men""), we've just started an affiliate programme that pays $100 for each client referred, approaching dating coaches and life coaches.

We're also working on increasing our SEO (this will come with the new site) as well as blogging much more, collaborating with writers/bloggers/publications like Esquire and AskMen. 

That's pretty much it though. Aside from the above, is there anything we should be doing that we're currently missing? We flirted with doing some free seminars about dressing well and using that to pitch our services, but we didn't know who to approach for this sort of thing. 

Bankers, investors and anyone in management positions really seem to like our service so we'd like to target them specifically, but don't have very good leads.

As you might guess, I am a developer, not a marketer, so I am somewhat clueless as to how to proceed.

Here are some things I have done so far:

* Started a split test of the homepage verbiage.  Here are the versions: [A](https://www.appointlet.com/a/), [B](https://www.appointlet.com/b/).

* Started a PPC campaign on Facebook.  This has been running for two days.  When I first started it, FB recommended a CPC of ~$0.65, but I chose to only bid up to $0.50.  After a few hours, I had racked up 57 clicks (only 25 made it to my site... not sure what happened there).  After that, the clicks and impressions dropped off entirely.  I assume this is because after my CTR was determined to be low, they stopped showing the ads.

* Started a PPC banner campaign on Adbrite.  I made about 10 different banners and uploaded them.  I put in a bid amount of $0.75/click.  This has been a complete failure, they obviously don't want to run the ad for that price, because I have had only a few hundred impressions over two days.  I stopped this campaign.

* Started a PPC campaign with Google.  Targeted a few industries, picked a couple of long tail-ish keywords, set the max bid to $1/click, and sent it on it's way.  This is only a day old, and has received a few thousand impressions, but only a single click.

Boss's company is a B2B consulting company catering to a very specific industry. A lot has changed in her company since her website was created in 2009, and she now offers a service that isn't even mentioned on her current site. We're currently working with a developer to create a new one, but in the mean time she wants to be able to push her new service ASAP because it's sort of time sensitive: the service is a payroll service, and people are now starting to consider payroll options for the upcoming year.

Included in our new media strategy is the creation of a company newsletter. She wants the first newsletter to focus solely on her payroll service, and she wants to send it to clients who use her *other* services and who haven't heard of her new payroll service yet.

Only problem is there has been no way for people to opt in to the newsletter yet. I just put a sign up form on her company FB page, and we're going to direct attention to it as best we can. However, she wants to just add clients to her email list without telling them first. She figures we'll send this one automatically, and that will create awareness of the service and the newsletter.

I told her this is bad practice, but she doesn't seem to care (is it not as bad as I think it is???). The best I could do was write a disclaimer in the newsletter saying that this is the only issue they'll receive automatically and that future issues will be available to those who opt in.

3) How much posting is too much? I've been limiting myself to 3 posts per week but am wondering if I can increase that. My fear is that I'll piss people off and they'll de-friend the page.

4) What kind of stuff gets ""liked"" the most? I'd prefer to only post content I have created and professional videos, but if posting pictures of dogs going to the bathroom gets likes, I can swallow my pride and do it.

I live with a struggling single mother who has done a wonderful job of creating her own pet care business (I was born with severe congenital heart disease and couldn't go into daycare, so she had to figure out a way to take care of me and generate an income for us), but times are tougher than ever now and we haven't really gotten any new clients for a long time. We don't have an online presence, and I'm not sure how to go about filling content on a website.

What we offer:

* In-Home Dog Daycare/Overnight Boarding
* Visiting your home to feed your dogs/cats or take your dog on a walk

That right there is pretty much the entire business. The thing about my mom, is that she is incredibly kind and offers a much higher-quality service than most other dog-walkers or overnight kennels, and yet we don't charge much more than anyone else. All clients have come through word-of-mouth references and consist of wealthy individuals (we are in an affluent area), such as doctors, lawyers, and business professionals, who can afford to have their dogs (and occasionally cats) looked after while they are away at work (~$50/day). That is the core of our income.

Our business is geographically dependent to our area, and I know very little about SEO, or what keywords to even optimize, for that matter.

My mom and I could really use your help figuring out how to generate more clients. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your time.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,True,,,True,t3_ths35,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/ths35/help_me_market_my_single_mothers_petcare_business/,

What I have learned about creating content.",,19,7,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/qpkxk/6_videos_and_over_1000000_views_later_what_i_have/,"This mini-article is in reference to one of my youtube channels - http://www.youtube.com/user/aceupsleeve3

I wanted to share my experiences in creating content that has generated over 1,000,000 views in hopes that it provides insight on how to create content for your business that will hopefully have the same kind of success.

The first thing to realize is not to look at what's there, but instead what isn't. When I came up with the idea for the ""25 Greatest Insults"" vid, it was because I had seen all sorts of MMA videos be about knockouts or fights. Never did I see it made for fun stuff like threats or insults. Doing something different makes you stand out.

Second, give people something to spread. By selecting things that are controversial, funny, or just plain out there people wanted to show it around. You won't get views from the people who browse youtube, you get views from those who spread it to everyone they know.

Third, the title is everything. Your title is what will bring people to click the play button. My titles represent a ""list"" in the sense that it is 25 or 20 or 30. No matter what the number is, people want to see if what they had in their head has made the list. There are other tricks as well you can use but the bottom line is the title is where it all starts.

So what does this all mean? When you make content to do marketing for your business, keep these tips in mind. It's not enough to just make a video that is the same as everyone else out there. You need to be different and be willing to push the envelope sometimes. If you do you'll get the eyeballs you want, after that you can really start selling what you have.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_qpkxk,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/qpkxk/6_videos_and_over_1000000_views_later_what_i_have/,

I recently got hired as the marketing coordinator for an ERP (enterprise resource planning) and CRM (customer relationship management) consultant company. They have not had any real marketing department for a year so I am basically starting from scratch.

What I am looking for is advice and suggestions for marketing a B2B company; modern methods of SEO and social media use are great for getting more visitors to our site, but when it comes to generating quality leads I am hitting a brick wall. Our target customers are manufacturing companies and other medium-large organisations.

If anyone has any tried and tested methods for marketing this type of business I would appreciate ANY and all suggestions, no matter how trivial or obvious.

Thank you for your time.

I'm looking for any advice I can get on what to look for in a marketing firm or where to find a firm that will be able to do a good job for our company. Any ideas about how much these services sell for is also going to help a LOT.

Among other things, I need someone who will:

1) Appropriately renovate the website.

2) Be able to help us with marketing copy for materials to distribute to potential clients, hopefully creating a particular brand image

3) Help us sending out targeted materials to particular potential clients in certain geographic areas that have some kind of chance of getting a response.

4) Know, from a practical standpoint, the ""dos"" and ""don'ts"" of what kinds of things to tell potential clients when you're doing marketing.

Loads of questions",HippiePete,15,6,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/12aw7e/affiliate_marketing_trying_to_understand_it_loads/,"im a student of Graphic design getting into the affiliate business but have loads of questions and things i don't quite understand yet. Ive noticed that its necessary for an initial investment for this to work and i don't want to get into the business without knowing shit... ive read around most blogs and have understood how it all works. I just can't seem to agree that the products listed on these affiliate programs are money making material. (not a scam).

For example: what do i pay for?? i understand that i need to mount a landing page, get the domain, search for keywords etc.. but i got this initial investment that I have to pay for the clicks?

(example: 1000 clicks @ .05 = $50. If a campaign is paying $50 per lead, that allows me to test with a “1000 clicks to 1 lead ratio”, before losing any money. 1000 clicks at .05 will not be easy to obtain on most high paying offers and volume may be slow, but it’s still profit. Set this same method up for 10 campaigns and you are earning at a faster rate.)


•  question 2:
 So ive been reading about a/b testing and it all makes sense. The fact that i need to create two different homepages on the same domain for example. index.html and index1.html; but im having a hard time trying to understand HOW i divide my traffic in to these two different webpages, How will i know that people who have come and gone to land on the same landing page they had before. I have found this websitehttp://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/ and like the idea that they seem to sell. I am a graphic design with enough knowledge in html and php to create landing pages with ease. So their creating system doesn't interest me too much but the heatmaps are quite a biggy. Do i really need all of this?
Also, for all of this to work, i need a large investment correct? i already need to have the campaign up and running on the web to assure that one of the two A or B will generate better scores and then, investing in it?




•  question 3:
 I am from Brazil and am a bit confused on ads or things i should be working on. Should i focus in my country or doest it no make a difference at all if i work with brands or things from around the globe? Wouldn't it be best focusing in my country for the fact that i might be more involved on the trends going on around here?




•  question 4:
 Ive read around a shit load lately and am very confused as to what i really need to get started in afilliate marketing. Ive noticed i need the help of several different websites that help optimizing my webpage .. or other networks that exhibit products for example ( http://www.offervault.com/ ) . What should i really be looking in to to start this off? I'm a bit confused as to what is needed to get a campaign up and running WITH a chance of getting some return cash. Whats a good initial investment, minding that im a college student with a small paying day job.



• question 5:
 How many Keywords is a good amount? Any links on best forms of stuyding these keywords? they seem to be the Difference here.



• question 6: 
 What is White hat?

I'm part of a team thats working on a new tool for mobile apps, called Appgage.
http://appgage.io/

One of the many hurdles we face trying to market mobile apps is keeping users engaged with our apps and maintaining retention (so they don't add our app to the dormant bucket or worse delete it). Appgage is a new tool for marketers specifically designed to help you learn more about your app's users at a personal level and best of all message and interact with your users. Taking messaging further and how busy marketers are, we added an automated messaging tool. Now you can simply set specific filters of when to send out messages, for example; send out a message only to users that have used your app once in the last 7 days, or send one whenever a user has spent more than $10 on in-app purchases.

We took messaging your users to a new level. This isn't simply via Apple Push Notifications because APNs don't work in all situations. Thats why we introduced 4 other channels of messaging.

There's tons of features, be sure to check it out at;

Because of my lack of experience, my job options were not very diverse and so it led me to a position that is mostly sales.

Now I come to a bit of a problem. As I look around for marketing positions, I am finding that I do not have the experience many of these require because I've spent these years in sales.

I am hoping maybe that someone here will have an idea or suggest where to look.

Recently I started advising on a network of social media sites for a company. For some strange reason nobody at the company had ever really looked at Facebook Insights, let alone exported the data. I have had some experience working with Facebook but I am trying to dive in deeper into the export XML that Facebook Insights spits out. By slowly combing through the multitude of metrics I have found a couple of ways to gain a better insight.
I am wondering if anyone has done the same and has come across any interesting articles, tips, or ideas about Facebook Insights. I am always looking for a better way to analyze data or a new perspective. I appreciate any ideas or tips that you guys/gals may have.

Let me pitch in my two cents of what I do and why. Maybe you do the same, maybe not, maybe I am all wrong. If I am all wrong then I have been lying to people for a while.
Over time I have seen people make a similar chart to mine. I am not sure if I ""borrowed"" this from someone or came up with it myself. Either way this is something that I have used for a while. So what I do is:

 a. Eliminate all columns on page level export except Lifetime Total Likes, Daily Friends of Fans, and Daily Page Consumption.

 b. Add the Lifetime Total Likes and Daily Friends of Fans together into a third column. 

c. Chart that column with the date. This shows approximately how many people you can reach on any given day and the growth of your page. I can already hear the screams ""This is just Reach"" or ""Look at the ""Virality"". I know, it is similar but not the same. Without looking at 3rd, 4th, 5th degree connections that may see your post somehow I look at my fans and their immediate circle of influence, not somebody who is three degrees out and two continents away.


This is a quick way to glance at what posts are working and which ones are not. Nothing in depth, just a guide of where to look for issues.

 a. Take the Daily Page consumption and chart it with the date. This gives you a general idea on which days the posts did well or not so well. From there you can analyze the posts and days that did poorly. This doesn't mean the posts with low consumption were bad, there can be a number of factors that influence the consumption.

I have a couple more of these that I use frequently. If anyone would like to see some more just let me know and I will be more than happy to share them.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_1j84xp,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/1j84xp/facebook_insights_export_ideas_and_help/,

I'm planning to open a company and retail a dietary supplement in China (as a WFOE).

How would you go and advertise your product in China? I'm not that familiar with Weibo for social media nor what kind of options I have for online advertisement. I have a product and I've thought of a few ways to retain customers but I would need customers in the first place for that.

Which advertisement platforms (such as Google AdWords/AdSense) are popular in China, and are present on both home and mobile devices? What about street advertisement? Provide a small stand and hire a Chinese salesman to advertise and sell samples, perhaps offering coupons for further online purchase. Paying an agency to get large posters in subway/bus stations (most likely too expensive though) or is there a way to provide pharmacies with advertisements?

VANITY MARKETING: Methodology of marketing products by pairing the product with people’s natural tendencies to share their successful achievements via crowdsourcing and social media outlets.

Our generation has seen more technological advances than the previous 3 before us, and products and services that are innovative and being accepted by innovators and early adopters are already becoming obsolete by the time they reach the early majority of Rogers’ bell curve. 

But anyone who has a “hipster” friend, or knows people that like to brag about being the first to have ever heard a band or social media site (I’m one of them), knows that those people will broadcast that knowledge to the world as best and as often as they can. And with today’s culture of equal share of voice through social media, each and every person has a pedestal to preach from, which leaves anyone with a decent sized ego looking for a way to distinguish themselves even further from the pack. Our generation still wants to be special, and we still want to be heard. People want to appear unique and innovative, but the vast exposure and access to information and technology today is making it harder and harder to stand out, but alas- we all keep trying. 

Enter “Vanity Marketing”. Vanity Marketing is a concept that I am using to help with the launch of a website that my company bangbang media is currently beta testing. The project, 62nd Stories, is simply a website (soon to be app) that allows people to share their personal short stories with the world, and allows self published authors a way to market themselves to readers using excerpts from upcoming books and shorter stories they’ve written. It also allows amateur writers and anyone with a unique story to tell to write and publish their story on a network where the public has access to read it, and in which good stories will be highlighted by positive votes from people that have read them (ala Rotten Tomatoes for films).  

Since this site will be 99% crowd sourced, we will be leaning on the writers to market their own stories. When a writer submits a story to our site, they receive a message that the story is under review. Once the story has been accepted and is published on our site, we provide the writer with links for them to share with their friends, family and followers on various social media sites. The exclusivity and achievement of being reviewed and accepted is something that these people can be proud of, so they want to share this achievement with their friends, since everyone still wants to be special and desires to have a louder voice amongst the crowd. 

In results so far, we have seen people post numerous times to their various social media sites about their accomplishment of being published on our site, and, though right now this feature has zero influence or incentive, these people are asking for their followers to vote on their stories. (At this point of beta testing the site, the only thing a vote does is add a +1 to the story. There is no prize, nor any specific outcome of stories with the most votes. In the future, the votes will be associated with prizing and a way to highlight better works for readers to easily find.) Each time someone votes on a story, that information is shared on their social media feeds, exposing our site to THEIR followers. We also have a comments section on each story, so whenever someone interacts with the story, it is posted on their walls, and when friends want to support their friend that has been published on our site, they share the link to help their friends get votes... again, these votes mean nothing right now.  

Each time a published author to our site shares their story, our traffic jumps anywhere from 50 – 200%, since friends of friends of friends of friends will see the activity. 

We all want to be special, and the most egomaniacal of us will self promote ourselves as much as we possibly can, so, as a smart marketer, why would you NOT hitch your wagon to the sneezers of personal vanity and allow these brand ambassadors to give your product a personal endorsement and use that opportunity to grow your user base? We scratch their back, they scratch ours, all by using Vanity Marketing.

Chicago wife, mother and finance executive Claire Cummings, arrives at work one morning to discover her friend Julia has embezzled millions and vanished.

I've only just started marketing on a side project of mine so here's what I've got so far:

**Dislikes**

 - Since it's my first time marketing, I'm a bit apprehensive when I put stuff out there.  Ideas are fragile and it can be tough when people provide criticism in using less than constructive means.

 - As a solo marketer it's really overwhelming knowing that there are so many channels that I *should* be using, but only having the time to use some of them.  I often have doubts as to whether or not I've chosen the best ones.

**Likes**

 - I've always been fascinated by marketing so I'm really happy that I'm doing it.  I think it's really interesting (and almost like a game) to see if you can get people to use a product.

 - I also really enjoy analyzing marketing campaigns that companies have done to see if I can learn from their successes and failures.

* 30,011 impressions – how many times my press release appeared somewhere PRWeb can track
(10,000 is average)

* 4,965 media deliveries – media outlets that received my press release

* 2,790 Google results for my headline:
“New Life Given to Old Art Form With Blinks of Awe for iPad”

* 506 reads – on PRWeb.com
(a few hundred is average)

* 30 interactions – downloads, link clicks, etc. on PRWeb.com

* 4 online pickups – sites that syndicated my press release
(4-10 is average)

I had a lengthy call with a person from PRWeb that walked me through the results. That’s how I got most of the information about averages and a clearer explanation of what each number meant. They also called to offer help with writing my first release but I had already submitted it by that point. I was happy about their high-touch approach for a beginner like me.

Frankly, I don’t feel great about the results. According to PRWeb, my high number of impressions and big names appearing in the media deliveries list^1 mean I had something newsworthy and reasonably well-written. Apparently not every press release gets forwarded to places like the New York Times. But the bottom line is the press release got limited pick up (the biggest being [Yahoo! News](http://news.yahoo.com/life-given-old-art-form-blinks-awe-ipad-071902825.html)) and those 30,000 impressions ultimately had very little effect on book sales. I’m happy to hear your feedback and entertain ideas for why that may be in the comments.

Naturally, PRWeb tried to upsell me to a plan that will let me continue pushing out press releases but I’m not sure that’s the best use of my time or resources given these initial results. I’m glad I tried the PR route but I’ll be looking for other ways to spread the word and make a bigger impression.

The corporate brochure is the standard response, and it does play an important role in building a strong case for your products and services.

Research shows, however, that clients and prospects want more than a corporate overview. They want quick, comprehensive information on how your products and services will help them meet their needs and goals. They also want assurance that you are trustworthy, experienced, professional and results-oriented.

We Like to Read About Others in Similar Situations

Client success stories address those needs, and more, for a very simple and compelling reason: people like to read about how others have prospered in situations similar to their own. Think about the projects and clients that excite you and get your attention. What projects are you working on that would make a great “true story”? Expanding your service area? Developing innovative solutions to your customers’ problems? Launching a new product? We all try to gain an edge by reading magazine articles, books, and watching do-it-yourself TV programs. Inc. magazine has become a national must-read for small business owners because it is full of interesting and instructive stories about other small business owners.

By talking about your clients’ success stories, you demonstrate that you know how to build and preserve good client relationships. Your clients are willing to tell their story and endorse you, so you must be treating them right and delivering exceptional results.

Because client stories are about real people seeking real solutions they are much more likely to be read and trusted as an information source. Thoughtful quotes, pictures and ROI discussions provide the whole picture. Rather than simply humanizing a situation, a client profile personalizes a situation. A powerful profile engages your prospects and they are able to imagine themselves profiting from the benefits you bring to the table.

Designing a Client Success Story Program

Will client success stories work for any company? They can breathe new life into your established sales and marketing efforts and their utility goes way beyond the initial sales appointment. The journalistic style and feature format makes them adaptable to a variety of applications — proposals, presentations, websites, tradeshows, direct mail and trade journals.

There are four key factors in building a successful client success story program:

Invite and feature the right clients — your selection criteria should factor in market segments, geography, vertical industries, and company size.
Ensure your client profiles are well-written and well designed — and have the same look and feel of your existing marketing materials.
Keep your client profiles current and convincing — add new business relationships and projects to your collection.
Use them everywhere – website, proposals, trade shows, direct mail, media and email marketing.
A Simple Place to Start
Survey your clients at the end of each project and determine if their experience was something to really shout about. Tell them you are interested in the success of their business as well as your own, and that you want to promote the story of your mutual success.

Do any of you know of a good website with standard contracts that can be modified and includes NDAs, benchmarks, consulting fees, budgeting, etc? All I need to do is draft up a contract and agree on what my consulting fees will be. It's a bit difficult as I'm trying to do something a bit different.

I'm looking to set a 6-12 month contract working with the company one of the following pricing tiers (depending on their preference). All tiers include covering my expenses.

**Tier 1 -** Straight hourly consulting fees (generally $150-$200/hr) for a fixed amount of hours per week (no commission, only benchmarks). Hourly price will be lowered depending on how many hours/week and the length of time the contract will be.

**Tier 2 -** A mid range hourly rate ($100-$150/hr) plus a minimal commission (on some sort of draw?) that will include bonuses for benchmarks hit. 

**Tier 3 -** A lower hourly rate ($60-$100/hr) with some type of equity built into the commission. I haven't really seen this done before but it shows my confidence in my skills and pays off when it succeeds. This way I get paid for each month of the contract up front and if my marketing plan succeeds, I get rewarded accordingly. It's tougher to get larger companies to agree to this, but smaller companies like the one I work for shouldn't be too difficult.

The problem were running into is customers calling who have already placed orders asking if they can get the same discount even though they ordered already.

We want to make our customers happy, but where do we draw the line? We've already told some customers whose orders have shipped already that we cant refund the shipping, but we will give them the 20% off their order. Another customer is asking if they can just return their entire order and re-purchase everything with the discount, even though they ordered several weeks before we even announced the sale and theyve already received their order. While they could do that anyways, they were nice enough to ask first, and they are within the the number of days they can return items according to our return/exchange policy (45 days)

What should we do? Set a cutoff for orders based on how much they spent?

Even if you answer only some of these questions (I hope I expressed myself well enough in English), it would be really helpful. Thank you very much.  

Questions:
1. How long have you worked in the field?  
2. Where do you draw the line – if you are hired to create a marketing strategy for a product/service and purposefully hide its shortcomings, that you know will strongly affect the quality of customer experience later on, will you do it?  
3. Do you agree with the opinion that a good marketer doesn’t lie, but also doesn’t tell the whole truth?  
4. Do you know of any techniques considered unethical by professionals, but nonetheless used by some companies?  
5. With sexuality being more and more explored in ads, what do you consider to still be a taboo in the field? What issues/topics/themes you would never use in your campaign, even though they could make it more successful?  
6. What is your opinion about advertisements targeting children under 12?  
7. What is your opinion about how woman body is presented in modern ads?  
8. Do your background and personal beliefs and (i.e. religion, philosophic views, culture you grew up in) affect in any way your work and decisions regarding the campaigns you create?  
9. Have you ever refused a job offer because of personal beliefs?

When looking though the most recent census I saw how huge the numbers of single parents (especially fathers raising children alone) are and wondered would they, along with same sex couples and childfree couples feel alienated by the marketing of family products being focused away from them.

But I understand how in advertising there is only such a short amount of time to get the message across that it is safest to keep with the image that people most readily associate with family. So I am not sure if that makes my point about same sex couples etc redundant.

I thought this was interesting. As a public company they're required ts disclose a lot, and this program has enough upfront costs that it has impacted their profits, and therefore they are discussing it.

There's one bit in this article that stood out in addition to the loyalty part:
&gt;For the quarter, however, Safeway said that revenue at locations open at least a year edged up just 0.1 percent.... The company said the tepid increase was primarily because it raised prices less than expected. That was offset by improvement in volume from the new loyalty program.

I have seen a lot of new Safeway stores that are well made and nice inside. Anecdotally , though, I have noticed that Safeway's prices are not as competitive as they once were. I have stopped shopping there because I am more budget conscious and have grown quite loyal to Trader Joes, and more recently Fresh &amp; Easy. 

At Safeway I am really struck by some luxurious displays, like glass rotundas for nuts, and I feel like I'm paying more for their new buildings.

The first interview went well, but I'm still not sure about how straight up the company is. The office only had some hand written signs on the doors, I would expect a marketing company to have some real signs. The office wasn't run down, but it definitely looks a bit unfinished. They say they work in retail stores. Does this mean handing out flyers? (I should find that part out tomorrow) They of course said there is room for more managers, but they only promote from within. No telemarketing, no door to door. They also claimed that their employees make about $1000/week commission.

Its getting to the point where spam is becoming a part of everything.. People without any knowledge of market positioning, or targeting now have the tools on their mobiles to spam literally any group.

I see it three times a day without trying. Manufacturers of xyz product spamming their own industry groups to equally not interested parties. Its like Audi trying to sell their cars to BMW HQ.

Social Media, blogs, blogrolls, bookmarking, article directories, profile links….. Yeah we get it… yes it’s important to tell the world about what you do… it’s how the world goes round…..

But isn’t the world instead heading down a path where 3 billion minor businesses and one man bands shouting about themselves, three times a day and not one of them is listening to anyone else. 

Example…. Twitter, how does that work in any sensible manner? You “follow” people you want to “follow” you back… not because they are interested in any ideas but because they want to sell us something…  And with forums and now discussion groups on linked in, with people who pretend to add something to the discussion while they find an excuse to link to their product page…  

What shameless contrived nonsense. And whats worse is people who dont want to do it, almost have to. Even this post is part of it… But the difference is I’m trying to add something of value in return for my link.

Isn’t it time marketeers targeted their efforts towards those who want to listen and acted with a little more discretion and consideration.

I’m old in internet terms. 16 years or so and I remember a time when the internet was about sharing ideas. Slow old dial up connections could not dampen our spirits with what was new and cool… where anyone could speak to anyone about almost anything ……  

But then, inevitable, business got it and presumed they owned it, trying to take over and it turned into a desperate and scratchy battle for control, first fought out on the battle grounds of domain names, black hat seo and then links.

So the techs got better, more transparent… the communications model has improved. New cool stuff has happened. But underneath it all is still this grubby matter of businesses trying to find new ways to dominate the world with the minimum of effort possible and as little interest in their customers as they can get away with…. that is until, mercifully, Google catch up with them.

Smart Digital Marketing

If businesses want to really improve why not pay more attention to what their site visitors are doing by learning and owning their analytics.  Ask themselves is visitor numbers and pageviews THAT important if 89% of your traffic bounces….. and ask themselves honestly is this what we want. Why not try to target their efforts better and deliver to those people who visit their site what they want…… It worked for Facebook.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_y7fc4,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/y7fc4/marketing_madness_somebody_say_something/,

It was just about as effective as I had hoped in our local market, but for some reason we have blown up in South America.  

Since shortly after the release, we've noticed a steady stream of 3-4 added Facebook likes in Brazil and Mexico per day.  It's exiting seeing our small jazz group go from 120 likes to over 300 in just over a month.    As a thank you, used Google translate to put together a promotion in Spanish and created a separate landing page on our website.  I wanted to track the success, so I installed some analytical tools on the back end of our site for the first time (When I created the site, we were mostly a small time band playing shows to a few friends and family, so I didn't bother with it).

I'm amazed at our reach.  Over the last 24 hours, we have well over 1000 unique IP hits.  Over 150 of them have stayed on our site for over a minute, and 80+ have stayed longer than 3 minutes.  None of this traffic is translating to digital sales though.  We've also only had 5 comments left on our blog since the release (none of the comments have been in the last 24 hours).  I can't help but think we could be doing a lot better to engage this new found audience.  Over 50% of our traffic is Spanish Speaking, but we post everything in English because none of us speak spanish.  I'm at a loss as to how we could better capture and engage this market.  Do any of you have any ideas on how we can better engage this audience?  

We aren't planning on touring through South America any time soon, so right now, our focus is on building brand awareness in hopes that we can build an audience large enough to support shows at some point in the future.

I'm just not happy with it.  I'm not wild about ending two sentences in a row with the same word, but synonyms for ""meal"" are all somewhat verbose or archaic sounding.

1333532604.0,9,self.marketing,rsnwn,23 Reasons Why Not Everyone Will Make Money Online,mariusprice,13,4,6,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/rsnwn/23_reasons_why_not_everyone_will_make_money_online/,"You Need A Plan

It is so important to have a good plan. It is equally important to stick to that plan! I have a plan for my new business, but I also have customers from my other online business that are currently generating income for myself.

Unfortunately, it’s harder for me to manage my time than I thought it would be. Part of a successful plan is to take action, but I haven’t take action every day. Because of my other customers I find myself working when I can and not necessarily following my plan….and I hate that!

So no more excuses for me, now I will start to follow my plan every day. Even if I have made a ton of
money online, I failed to follow my plan.
Always follow your plan!

So now it’s time for me to get back on track and start managing my time better than before. I work from home, wake up when I want and work when I want. Sure, that’s awesome, but to create and maintain long-term success it’s important to care for my current customers while also building my new
business.

So here’s what I’m going to do, I’m going to start my own newsletter. (you can register to any newsletter from my site and you will be on my list)

By having a newsletter, people can subscribe to it, and it makes it a whole lot easier for me to communicate with my list because I can send the same newsletter to all subscribers.
Doing this will:

#1 build my list, and

#2 help manage my time more efficiently.
So that now brings me to the second big topic for this post:
23 Reasons Why People Fail To Make Money Online:

1. They do not follow their plan
2. They Never take action
3. Excuses (I do not have time, etc)
4. I do not have the right tools.
5. I do not have money to get a domain name
6. I do not have money to pay for hosting

7. I do not have money to create a Newsletter
8. I don’t have technical skills
9. I don’t know how to create a site
10. I don’t speak English very well
11.I don’t know how to create articles
12.I don’t know how to do press releases
13.I don’t know how to get traffic
14.I don’t know how to create a video
15.I don’t know anything about Link Building
16. Trying to be right from beginning(scared of failure)

17. Spending money on new IM products without using it or taking action
18. Never even start
19. They think too much
20. They think it’s too late to jump in
21. They want to make money right now
22. They think it’s too hard
23. They look for push button software
So let’s expand on the above and let me explain what you can do in those cases:

1. Firstly, you have to follow your own plan.

Make a plan and even if you are sick, tired or work till 2AM or 3AM just do it. No one can help you if you do not follow it.

I remember when i had a day job and at the same time I was working for my customers and sometimes I even stayed up till 4AM even 6AM and then I had to be up and ready to go to work. I am glad those days are finished for me and i hope you too will take action and end having a day job.

2.The time you work will come from your plan….even if you work only 15 minutes…that is better than doing nothing…so just manage your time and do something productive.

When I had day job, everything was on my mind except for work! What I had to do when I got back home…I planned everything before coming home and by working my daily job I was able to bring in a substantial income while still working on my online business.

My day job was tough, but just being able to think about what I needed to do for my future online business made it a little bit easier.

3. Excuses have to stay away if you want to be profitable. If something bad or something that you haven’t planned happens…its ok, suck it up and move on! If its something you can correct, get busy and correct it! If its something out of your control, its time to accept this and move on to your next task.

4. You do not need any tools if you do not have money to start. If you don’t have money to register your own domain (as cheap as $10 per year), then you certainly don’t have money to buy IM tools.

5. If you do not have money to get a domain name do not worry, do not get one because there are other ways to do it.

6. If you don’t have money for a domain name or hosting, no problem.

In 2007 I started my online blog using Google.

I used Google because they let me advertise any product, so I started my blog in the Forex niche. Even today I still trade…and every morning before work I make a post and make another post in the evening when I come back from work (you do not have to do the same, depends on your niche).

The blog that I still have is mapthemarket.blogspot.com and trust me I made about $300 or even more every month without having a list but just promoting products from my niche and I still make some money from that blog even if I do not touch it.

7. If you do not have money for a newsletter software then go and get Mailchimp which is free or iContact which is free up till 100 subscribers.

8. There are a lot of step by step online instructions on how to do things, so just search on Google or leave a reply on my blog and let me know exactly what you want to learn and I will be glad to cover it on my blog.

9. If you want use blogspot.com from Google, it’s very easy. If you have a domain and a hosting account just install wordpress from your control panel + your hosting will provide you step by step info on how to do it.

10. If you do not speak English very well use translate.google.com/toolkit/TOS.html and http://translate.google.com/ and write in your language then translate it into English, but you can also do it in your own language…maybe English speakers haven’t touched your language to do internet marketing
…it could be a goldmine!

11. If you don’t know how to create articles then do not do this step until you have money to do some outsourcing. It’s cheap…but it’s still money.

12. I never did a press release but that doesn’t mean I can’t make money online:) so do not do it until you can pay someone to do a press release, or research it online and have a go at it!

13. Traffic will come by telling your friends, posting quality content, comment on other blogs, post on forums and add a signature back to your blog, do not think about it too much, just do it.

14. Video marketing is also a great way to get some free traffic, but if you don’t know how then do a quick Google search or you can leave a reply and let me know what exactly you don’t know about videos and I will be glad to help you.

15. Link building is easy and you do not have to use any paid software or stress too much….go and find blogs in your niche and comment and leave your blog link.

16. No one is right and you do not have to stress so much because you can fail….we learn in our failures. “It is better to have tried and failed then to never have tried at all.”

17. Oh man….stop buying product after product….If you have one then take action and see if it really works. If it works great, rinse and repeat.

18. Just start! That’s right. Just start. More people research so much and read so much and take so many internet courses that they get burnt out before they even start putting everything into action! In this industry the term is “information overload”. Just start, the worse case scenario is that it didn’t work and
its time to try something new!

19. If you think too much about how much money you can make or need to make, then you may very well make nothing! As you go you will learn more and more…and tweek your plan to what you notice works.

20. It’s Never too late to start!

21. Making money right now online is not as easy as you think. Work step by step and you will see returns. Try not to skip any steps to get closer to the money, it may hurt you in the long run.

22. Something is Hard….but its even harder if you don’t do it.

23. Don’t fall for the push button software solutions that claim to make you rich overnight. The only person getting rich overnight is the creator of that software. It takes time and work to make money online…there is no such thing as push button success!

Yesterday evening I was a little hungry and my stomach was asking for something sweet. So I went to the new bakery that opened two weeks ago just across the street. They had tons of applie pie, banana bread and many other biscuits and cakes which looked really good, but I decided to have two donuts.

When I ordered them, the shopkeeper said to me: ""Three donuts cost the same as two, 1.50€ - so I'll give you three, ok?"". ""Ok"", I answered, although I wasn't that hungry. ""One donut is 0.90€ and two or three donuts cost 1.50€"", the shopkeeper repeated. When I went back home I couldn't stop wondering whether such a ""three for two"" strategy was really appropiate for that new bakery. Shouldn't they sell two donuts at, let's say, 1.30€ and three at 1.50€?

I suppose you all know ""TheEconomist"", a monthly business news magazine. Some time ago they used a very similiar sales strategy as the bakery from my neighbourhood. I don't remember the exact prices, but a subscription to the printed version of The Economist cost around 60€, while the suscription to the online version cost 120€. And there was also a third option: the subscription to the print and online version also cost 120€. So what was the sense of the second option (online version only)? Who would prefer it over the third option? Most probably... nobody. Most likely, the second one was a kind of a benchmark for the other two and it made the third option look less expensive.


I guess the new bakery from my neighbourhood tries to apply the same sales strategy: three donuts may seem less expensive if they cost the same as two. I'd say it's a good idea as many people will end up buying three donuts instead of one. Nevertheless there may be one hitch: some people may want to eat only two donuts and not three, especially if they're on a diet or if they just count their calories (with one of those fancy calorie counters). But this is something that the bakery will have to figure out – I'll let you know you if they stick to this sales policy or not.

Then a series of email campaigns consisting of the initial email, a reminder email, and then a final reminder email to all those register. You can see the email I used [here](http://www.bcsprosoft.com/eads/deltek/12q4-deltek-cloud-houston.html) During the weeks that email blasts were sent out one of the guys from the sales team began a call campaign trying to drum up some support. He also did some calls to confirm attendance the day before the event. We also used the remaining funds to fly in a couple of guys from the company that developed the software for a presentation.

As expected, these events were small. We had about 15 people in each meeting. However there was a great deal of interest from the people who attended and we generated some great leads as well as some excellent potential to sell our consulting services and upgrade some of our existing clients. There were also a couple of people who attended who are probably better candidates for another product we sell. As usual, there were a couple of IT guys at each event trying to sabotage things because they are generally threatened by the idea of their companies having their databases hosted elsewhere. Despite their many objections, they were able to provide some great conversation topics. All-in-all, the two events will likely pay for themselves in the coming months.

I've also experimented with copy, images, etc, but have still seen a dismal conversion rate.

First off, sorry for the horrible pun.

Essentially, I have the option of graduating this coming Fall semester with a B.B.A in Marketing, or tacking on another semester to pick up an Information Technology minor along with it. My ideal career path is more focused on the end point, in which I hope to be along the lines of a marketing coordinator/manager within a company or marketing firm, or doing marketing consultation.

Right now I am trying to see if I can justify the cost, which would be around 3k in loans (excluding opportunity costs of not working full time/food/gas etc.). 

I do enjoy the subjects taught in the minor, which consists of learning web development, adobe tools, java, and database management.

My question isn't necessarily ""Will it help me achieve my goal?"" 
It's more ""Is an IT minor on paper worth having when applying for jobs within the marketing realm?"" 

I understand marketing encompasses many many areas, so it would be great to see how each area would view an applicant with the same skillset + experience, with only a difference in their Minor.

My current philosophy about being a good marketing coordinator is to know a lot about a lot of things, that way communication is easier and more time efficient between team members. 

Ex: I met a marketing coordinator who talking to me about how they go day to day, and the topic of graphic designers came up. They were venting how difficult it is to work with them, but it seemed that the coordinator just didn't know how to relate or understand them well enough.

**TL;DR:** 

Is taking another semester for an Information Technology Minor cost-effective alongside a B.B.A in Marketing degree when my career goal as of now would be a marketing manager/coordinator or involved with consultation? (Cost of the minor would be around USD 4,000, less expenses of living)

Thank you for any responses! And If anymore detailed is needed to answer I'll be happy to oblige!

Cheers.

I am fresh out of grad school with a Master's degree in Marketing and would love to work for an Ad Agency. I have applied at a couple of places with but have had no luck. My experiences include a digital marketing internship for a leading sport fashion brand (where I was the creative lead on several projects), and marketing work for a small business (where I was the creative lead for, amongst other things, TV ad campaigns).

It seems that all agencies are looking for are the artist types who can actually draw and create things (I'm quite skilled in photoshop, but that's about it), and not so much for the creative types with an academic knowledge of branding and marketing (and can't actually build what they're thinking of).

Can I just say I love this sub? Ok time for my question...

I'm trying to get some traction going for a facebook page. It's for a big company but the facebook page has about 40 likes (it's ridiculous for me to see such big companies with no social media presence!) They want to use the facebook page for mostly recruiting purposes. 

I wanted to try and fire off an internal contest firmwide with all employees and give away prizes to those that got the most friends to like our new page. I'm thinking our ads will be more popular and effective if our page already has some traction. Does Facebook Analytics track exactly what user brought in the most traffic or likes? Is there another way to track it that hasn't occurred to me yet? Do you have any other ideas for how I can boost internal employee support for the page? (Any resources/websites with ideas?)

If it turns out great, it might make a good portion of a newbie FAQ. I've seen enough ""I have no idea what I'm doing, help!"" posts to last me the rest of 2013. If that's you, then I hope you gain some wisdom from the old farts in here.

**General rule in marketing: Focus on what the client or your boss says he or she wants to see and do everything you can to deliver.** 

She wants to see immediate ROI? Don't pitch blogger outreach. She needs clients fast? Don't sit on inbound/SEO and wait around. Next one is similar.

**If you're in a small marketing department, do stuff that will grow the business and actually make money.** 

I firmly believe that a business should be doing one or more of these three things: get leads, get sales, or create value for someone. If you're doing something that doesn't involve one of these then stop wasting everyone's time. 

**Regarding moving my lazy ass: There are two types of people in this world: waiters and creators. Waiters wait for something to happen to them. Creators make their own fortune.**

If you look around, there are a lot of waiters--and we all used to be one. Form good habits and start creating opportunity. **If you don't ask, you'll never get anything.**

**General business rule: The Golden Rule: He who has the gold, makes the rules.** 

Was told this by an OG HR pro I used to work with. Whenever we would talk about the way decisions ought to be made (instead of how they were being made) he would remind me of the Golden Rule. I learned that I spent too much time thinking about the way things would be if I was in charge and started doing my job better. If helped me move on when mentally stuck on poor management decisions and forced me to reconsider my work situation--much better situation now.

We have now jumped into a trial of a online software package called ""WOW Analytics"", where it basically looks up the IP address of visitors on our site, compares them to their database - to then assign it a company name if there is a match. So far we've had it a few days and it has produced some interesting results - although a lot are just other marketing companies. The problem is, they company that provide WOW analytics want £150/month for under 20K pageviews (we get around 1500), so I am wondering if there are any other similar products out there that cost any less?

I'm hoping that it will help with remarketing for future sales.

I've done some Facebook ads to test the water but now I want to start a different campaign to gain more likes by emailing our subscribers. It's going to be awesome! 

**Proposition:** Send out seemingly personal emails to our list of member/subscribers to gain more followers on our Facebook page.

**Execution:** I already have a spread sheet of all the members emails, along with first &amp; last names in a spread sheet. Upload it on MailChimp and let is fly baby because it's bananas (da-dum-tss).

**Goal:** Give us more options in re-marketing for future sale. From my understanding it's cheaper to advertise to on Facebook to people that already like your page. Plus I think it would also help in brand awareness.

**Road Block:** Developing an email that will entice members to click through to our Facebook page. Currently I post on our Facebook page 3-4 times a week (only 81 likes now, so I don't want to overload their feeds) with funny/interesting news related to our industry and posts about upcoming sales. So far some of these posts have been shared and have also received comments. 


**Example of email:**

""Hey [first name], we want to thank you for registering and becoming part of the [company name] community. 

To find out first about our sales, industry news and more check us out on Facebook.


Warmest Regards,

[company name]


The idea is to keep it short. But I was thinking about doing an alternative and test it against an email with HTML that would have images that looks like our Facebook page.

Any insight on this conundrum? I feel uncertain on how to approach the email since I'm unfamiliar with making this kind of call to action. I can post our Facebook page and more info on our company is necessary.

TLDR: I plan to email subscribers with a seemingly personal email letting them know about our Facebook page for future re-marketing campaigns. I'll let you know the result if anyone else is interested.

I'm quite proud of the things I've accomplished and was recently picked up by an agency to introduce my platform into their company. Ive got some cool systems and processes that keep things running smoothly and avoid excess scope creep.

The NDA I've been given raises some concerns but I have no experience in the agency environment and would like some opinions/guidance. Besides the things i would classify as normal here are some things that stand out:

**PART I: Confidential Information**

1.	I acknowledge that the Company is the exclusive owner of its Confidential Information, which includes all information regardless of its form of recording, not in the public domain, related to: 

c.	The Company’s business methods, practices, strategies, and related information including marketing and advertising, and indices, techniques, and data retention methodologies by which the Company maintains information regarding its clients.
   
f.	All secrets, trade secrets, know-how, ideas and processes of the Company. 

**Followed by:**

3.	I agree that during my employment with the Company or at any time thereafter, I will not disclose any Confidential Information to any person, including any competitor of the Company, or future employer or mine. I will not use the confidential information for any purpose other than those permitted by the Company. 

5.	I agree that during my employment with the Company or at any time thereafter, I will not make copies, summaries, or extracts of Confidential Information, nor will I remove any Confidential Information from the place of business unless authorized by the Company. 

I'm sure if you've read this far, you are probably thinking this is pretty normal... but here's the thing. They've brought me in to incorporate MY business processes and strategies I developed myself. Assuming that upon that integration, my processes and strategies become theirs - am I shooting myself in the foot if they turn around and decide to oust me for whatever reason?

I consider myself a moral person and would never rip someone off, I just want to protect myself in case of worst case scenarios.

Any and all input is greatly appreciated.

Would love your input [x-post from /r/startups],interrupte,11,3,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/14a00j/website_marketing_strategy_would_love_your_input/,"Apologies for the long post. Two weeks ago I launched my second website: www.Givetu.me, and received a ton of great feedback and suggestions from you guys (original thread: http://www.reddit.com/r/startups/comments/13jqiw/just_launched_my_second_website_would_love_your/). I've tried to implement as many of the suggestions as possible and tried to promote the website through a variety of channels after that. After about a week, I realized that the growth I've been seeing with my current approach will not make the concept feasible in the longer run. 

One of the key things I've found is that people are much more receptive to checking out ideas if they have some background on who is behind it/why it exists and so I will provide you with a bit of context on myself before going into my marketing strategy. I graduated University in Canada with a degree in finance and currently work full-time at a small financial advisory firm. I've always been intruiged with entrepreneurship and taught myself Html, PHP and Javascript in order turn some of my ideas into reality. My skills in these are limited and I have no formal training in coding, design, marketing etc.. Everything is entirely bootstrapped and created by me (other than the design of the site for which I brought on a friend of mine who is a graphic designer). With this in mind, I would love to hear your input regarding marketing my site. 

Here is my marketing strategy (as at Tuesday Dec 4th):

**1. Facebook/Google+:** 

*Current Strategy* - Post a new gift idea each day, grow through shares/likes of gift ideas, invite all friends to the page

*Outcome* - 56 Likes, 1 post with a new product every day (seen on avg by 40 ppl)

*Conclusion* - Not nearly enough growth. Most likes came within the first week and the gifts are not being shared.

*Proposed Strategy going forward* - Joining student groups/christmas related groups with my personal facebook account and spreading the word (I realize it's very important not to sound like a professional marketer/spammer and that the messages have to be genuine and relevant)

**2. Twitter:**

*Current Strategy* - Same as before, post a tweet with a new gift idea every day. To be honest, I don't really understand how twitter works or how to get more followers.

*Outcome* - virtually no followers

*Proposed Strategy going forward* - Based on discussions with some people more knowledgable than I in this regard, I will be following competitors/people looking for CHristmas gifts. Also posting gifts relevant to trending topics and then use hashtag to hopefully show up.

**3. Forums/Blogs:**

*Current Strategy* - Contact Christmas blogs/tumblrs and introduct the product

*Outcome* - no outcome so far

*Proposed Strategy going forward* - keep hustling

**4. Paid:**

*Current Strategy* - Test out various paid advertising services to see which channels (if any) work the best. Tested: Reddit ads, Google, Bing

*Outcome* - No real traction. Traffic was far too expensive on CPC basis

*Proposed Strategy going forward* - drop paid advertising as it does not seem to work for this type of low margin (affiliate commissions are ~4-6%) business model

On average, each 100 visits will result in 60 product link clicks which results in 2-3 sales. However the site does not have enough traffic for me to be able to say that this is the normal conversion level. Do you think I'm heading in the right direction?

We have a marketing guy that's worked at a senior level for companies that you would all recognize. Unfortunately, he has no clue how to do marketing without a multi-million dollar budget. At this point, a multi-dollar budget is wishful thinking. 

Anyways, we're running a job site. We've got some big name companies in there posting some very well paying professional and executive jobs (we don't do the blue collar thing) thanks to our sales guys (separate from the marketing guy). To make a long story short, we've had an incredible response from companies posting jobs, but our marketing guy has basically thrown up his hands and said that he can't get professionals into the site without a budget. I can't imagine that's the case. Right now we have nearly one job for each professional in the database. We've got an incredible value proposition and right now everything is free. There's got to be a way to reach critical mass with this thing without having to spend a ton of money.

So the other guy in tech and I have gone rogue. We're gonna figure out how to market this thing and get these jobs in front of the professionals who want to apply for them. 

So far, I've been plugging away [writing a story](https://plus.google.com/u/1/110293288202646734200/posts) to target the pain points that our potential professional customers have. The name is fake btw since I still have a day job and my current employer can't know about this. I've got a bunch of legit job postings to use as teasers to get people signed up. 

I asked in the /r/forhire sub if I could promote my jobs there. They told me to take a hike. Based on the chilly reception there, i'm pretty sure that promoting jobs in subreddits for their area would be even more frowned upon. 

So does /r/marketing have any ideas of where I could tell my story or how to figure out where my potential customers are hanging out? I've got the programming/tech part kinda figured out, but we've got jobs in accounting, banking, HR, marketing, sales, science, R&amp;D and others. No clue where to start with these now that i'm scared to promote on reddit.

My name is Alex, and I’m working on a project called Qalixa. We’re currently updating our websites design and I’m looking for some pointers and reviews before we publish it for real.

The idea behind our project is to combine the three business models; B2C (Business to Consumer), C2C (Consumer to Consumer) and B2B (Business to Business) into one; B4A (Business for all). 
This makes Qalixa more than just a website; it’s a platform for the whole world to do business, both corporate and private. Place free ads, browse among millions of retail products and connect with new suppliers as a company to lower your expenses. Simply put, Qalixa offers a marketplace for everyone. 

We decided to narrow this complex business model into a more understandable concept/message; Sell, Buy and Share (SBS). Our website is based on the SBS concept, and we want to explain/describe the model through an animation.

So I’m turning to you reddit, and your knowledge. Below I’ve listed four images of the website, one image for every time the animation switch (Sell, Buy and Share). And a last image of when the category listing is highlighted (this effect occurs once you hoover your mouse over any category). 

Please take these images into accurate consideration, and answer the following questions:

The images are on imgur in an album, check them out:

http://imgur.com/a/oOfpB

-	What was the first element that draws your attention?

-	Are the messages of Sell, Buy and Share clear enough?

-	What can be improved?

-	After seeing Sell, are you willing to place an ad – or do you rather use eBay-like sites? Why?

-	After seeing Buy, are you willing to browse – or do you rather use Amazon-like sites? Why?

-	After seeing Share, are you willing to connect with your social media account?

-	Did we succeed in making a highly user-friendly website? 

-	What functions do you like? Why?

-	Are there any functions that would attract you more, that’s missing on the frontpage?

-	If you randomly land on our website, would you stick around and explore it or ‘x’ it the same second you arrive? Why/Why not?

-	If there’s anything else you’d like to add about the design of the website, feel free to do it here:

I ""work"" (full-time volunteer) at a disaster relief organization. As part of the PR department, one of our tasks is sending out emails to our mailing list (mostly donors and volunteers). What everybody in our department prefers (and what we've been doing up to this point) is sending emails roughly once a month, focusing on the quality of the emails rather than quantity; after all, if there's nothing particularly exciting to report, then what's the point in bothering several thousand people with another email to delete?

Our boss is more or less the exact opposite -- I hate to say it, but his is really more of a shameless spamming approach. His method, visible in his Twitter and Facebook feeds, is to just bring as many people as possible into his connections and just send out content constantly (~50 pre-written automatically-posted Tweets daily ranging from current to 3-year-old content, as one example). He wants to bring some of this approach to the emails.

He suggested pulling content from some of our monthly program reports to create *weekly* emails (to one of our team members he even suggested creating *DAILY* emails). Our biggest concern with this is that... even to people who are interested in how we're doing, these are extremely internal reports that... really aren't interesting at all to the majority of outside observers, and it would take a disproportionately-large amount of time to re-write them in a way that might appeal to our audience. Strictly speaking, we COULD create weekly emails, but it really would feel like we're just desperately trying to get out as much as we can as quickly as we can, rather than focusing our efforts on producing something truly worth sharing, and I can almost guarantee our audience would feel the same way.

Our department feels like the greatest frequency we could reasonably achieve and still maintain quality is bi-weekly. We're a small team and have no dedicated email person, so weekly emails would pull a lot of time from the other things we're doing.

I suppose my question here is this: **Is it really such a problem, from a ""building and maintaining trust with your audience"" standpoint, to send out average emails weekly instead of carefully-crafted emails infrequently?** Any advice from those more experienced than I? :)

As the title says, I'm approaching my senior year of college at a top ranked business school (not the top top, but it makes a few lists). Ideally, I'd really like to get a job at an advertising. If you watch Mad Men, I pretty much want Peggy Olson's job -- something in the creative department (I'll x-post to r/advertising, too, but I figured I might as well start broad). 

I have no internships under my belt. Due to the nature of the curriculum at my school, this year is my first year taking major classes. I thought it wasn't worth my time to apply for internships since I didn't think I was qualified/had anything to offer. My summers have not been idle -- I have a job and just finished 6 weeks studying abroad in Europe taking an international marketing class. But I've always heard that an internship looks way better on a resume than a steady student job.

What should I do to boost my resume? There aren't many internship opportunities available to me in this city to complete during the semester, and I'm also worried what effect an internship would have on my grades. Should I look for internships when I graduate to get experience, or look for a ""real"" job instead?

I've also considered putting together a little portfolio -- nothing too intense, but maybe something I do in my spare time to take a break from studying where I can mock up some ad campaigns or something. Would this be helpful since it wouldn't be ""formal"" and just in my spare time? Do you have any tips for this sort of thing?

I started doing animation and then managing video production and writing scripts to make videos for companies on their sites.

Then I started doing more general copy-writing, blog writing, and web content writing.

What I found in all of this is that there's a fair amount of initial consultation that goes into everything, and I really like the process of learning about a person, their company, their position in the marketplace, competitors, and their USP, etc., and helping them express that in whatever media we're working in.

I'm starting to think I'd like to work in an agency that can provide a clearer structure and path than what I'm doing now, and I think I have the ability to learn whatever I'm missing very quickly given how fast I taught myself everything else I've been doing.

My question is - what do these skill-sets and abilities make me?  The closest term I came up with was 'marketing consultant', but I have no idea how I would sell myself to a company as such with my very random portfolio.

I guess another question would be - if I'm missing some crucial skill (i.e. social media marketing), I'd love to have that pointed out so I can start learning about it as well.

Just a little lost, thanks for any clarity you can provide.

I feel like I need to focus a bit on endomarketing (internal marketing, this is how my teachers call it) before I start with the external public.

One idea I got was a birthday card (made by real designers, not some wordart shit) with a 25% cupom for one purchase on the month of their birth. 25% is kind of symbolic as most people know this is the discount the president and vice-president get when they buy something from the store, so they feel like they belong to the family even if just for a month.

I'm going to hand out my business cards to the managers and desk clerks at the hotels, and on the back will be a certificate that grants them a free entree at the restaurant. The idea being that if they come in and redeem it and like the food, and the food there is good, they will be more likely to send their guests our way. 

I will also be handing out stacks of cards for the desk clerks to give the guests. On the one side will be directions to the restaurant from the hotel, and on the other will be a coupon for a free appetizer or dessert. These serve two functions: it will encourage them to come in, and once they redeem it, we will know which hotel sent them, as it will have the hotel on the back of the card. That way we know which hotels are being strong marketers for us, and which ones we should target more heavily.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_muzb7,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/muzb7/just_got_promoted_from_waiting_tables_to_director/,

Background:

Me and my brother dedicated over 2 years to create [Afterwind](http://afterwind.com), a browser-based multiplayer strategy. The game is somewhat similar to Risk, but is a lot more detailed and complex. We launched it almost a year ago, with moderate success - currently we have over 18000 registered users and many dedicated regular players, some of them playing since the launch. The game is free, but we're charging for additional features - this already brings more than enough to cover hosting fees and some small-scale advertising.


Problem:

Unfortunately we cannot organize a decent promotional campaign for the game, lacking both the skills and resources. We believe the game has a lot of potential, would be a shame to waste it. W're now trying to form some kind of partnership with a company who can handle promotion - involving shared ownership perhaps. Is it realistic?

Help?

We would be very grateful for any kind of advice / pointing in the right direction. Promoting the game ourselves is pretty much not an option (believe me, we tried), so we need help - a company or a skilled individual.

After a few years slogging it for employers, working my ass off to earn them a living and paying my own way through a postgrad in marketing, I'm finally steps away from doing my own thing - setting up my own business.  Only thing is, I'm really quite scared.

I'm a couple of weeks away from launching an agency - doing all sorts such as web design, print design, designing things like infographics,  videos, social media and marketing consultancy, PR and so on.  My site is launched but things like case studies and profiles aren't going up for a few weeks.

I know this is an area which is very saturated and there are a lot of people doing this kind of thing.  I guess the target market is above budget level but also reasonable - progressive small businesses and medium businesses who are looking for quality, but have budget restraints.  The value of what my agency will do will be based on experience of being client side, understanding marketing better than other agencies and producing value at a reasonable cost.    

Where I'm finding difficulty is actually communicating this.  I'm thinking of doing blogs/infographics/market reports to show that I get the client's markets.  But I'm scared this is a long term strategy and I might struggle to get clients at the start.  By the same token I don't want to cheapen the brand doing things that get quick results but a bad reputation.  I'm not even sure my USPs are strong enough - maybe I can refine these?

I guess this raises a pretty obvious question.  If you're setting up an agency advising people how to do these things, you should know yourself.  I think sometimes opinions outside of your bubble can be more helpful though and I'm finding it difficult to be objective with my own business.

He has a Facebook page for the shop and, most importantly, he has an online shop that people can order from and have items delivered to their home. As well as this, there is a shop that people can visit and have a browse.

Ultimately he wants to be able to do away with the physical shop and just do all of the orders online. I've told him that one of the best ways of getting noticed would be to use Facebook, Twitter and the like. He said to me if I want to have a look into it and see what I can do then I can.

So I sat down and thought about it and I realised that what I was saying, that ""social networking is the way forward"", is just something that has been drilled into my brain and I don't actually know *how* it is used to generate a bigger ""fan base"".

Are things like Facebook and Twitter *really* that useful for something like a clothing store? How can I use them to generate more interest in the store?

As of right now the highest converting regions of marketing are social media (if targeted correctly - most social network users can't tell they are being pitched a product) and training/blogs/tutorials.



It's lucrative, too. Take a look at Shoemoney. He made a decent amount from google adsense then just started marketing training/coaching to unsuspecting would-be marketers trying to make a living in this shitty economy.



Another thing about a good portion of the blogposts posted in this section are very keyword rich, and reddit is in the top 100 on alexa, so it's just a free place to drop a backlink. I may be being  a bit cynical, but I've been screwed over and mislead before and have made MANY very expensive mistakes to get where I am now.

As outsiders looking in it has been extremely difficult. 

Successfully marketing a new service that has a very low amount of traffic is the single greatest achievement one can accomplish these days and is a giant green checkmark on the resumé. 
Doing this while attending school is a whole different level. 

I want to get a few students in a couple of different markets to compete with each other. If you are successful I will give you 100% of the credit for your work to use on your for a school project, your resumé, and possibly a role on the Flatscore team if interested. You will have a ton of creative freedoms that most corporate campaigns do not allow. This is really nice, trust me. Last but not least we have been talking to TechCrunch and they have promised us a story. We want to do this story after we try this school campaign. The student that receives the most traction will get credit in the article since that will be the focus of our growth.

So far we have someone that is working on a campaign for Penn State. If you are a college student and think you can market something I'd love to hear from you. I'm looking for around 3 - 4 students to representing  different schools. Message me if you are interested or have any questions.

Thanks for taking the time to read this post.

First a little bit of ground info:
I founded a web hosting company that opened its doors a few months ago. One of the things I did to increase my value proposition is reduce my margins to about 4/1 -- still not bad in most industries but, definitely nothing near the 15/1 margins most web hosting companies have.

Unfortunately, because I don't have as large of margins I really cant afford to advertise against them due to the high bids they are able to place on things. I mean check out their affiliate programs, they often have like $150+ payouts just for one signup-- I can't compete.

The thing is I don't want to switch back to the paradigm of overcharging just so I can advertise my business. I think that I can really do a lot for the web hosting industry in regards to improving the overall quality of the service that the internet hosted on-- but I don't know how to spread the word.

Any ideas? Anything helps

I work for sizable outdoor website and we have been trying to use an affiliate network to cut down of CPA with ad words as well as create a more customer loyal base. At the moment though, it has been lacking. We were overwhelmed by the number of coupon sites and came to the conclusion we were simply cannibalizing sales (*search site_name_coupon after already being brought to our site via PPC, the said coupon site then gets a commission, even though the customer was already at our site).

We have a new approach and it is to leverage our current affiliate marketing network, which gives us access to content rich sites that are based in the outdoor industry. Using this, we are going to contact content sites and give them a commission using Commission Junction, but with a twist: the blogger gets to pick 2 of 5 new products to review, test and keep. We will pick the 5 products based on their site and compatibility. Every month (or Bi-monthly) we will send them product. The blogger must have a certain number of photos, a video and then at least a 500 word write up. If at any time we feel they have not fulfilled these requirements, they are booted. At the same time, when the bloggers get the shipped product, we will also be sending them coupon cards to hand out to friends as well stickers and a few shirts with the company logo. 

This approach (sending out free gear and the like) I feel is going to be very hard to demonstrate ROI. The best we could do with the coupon cards for ROI is to track where they are coming in from, and if the coupon card sales are coming in from the same location as the bloggers, then something is working. This is more a grassroots effort, it seems it may be able to work but it's going to take time and patience to grow the relationships (which I'm not sure the owner has the patience for).

**My question is this:**

Does anyone here have experience using ambassador programs? How do you demonstrate ROI for something like an ambassador program (meaning, when I go to create the program, I have metrics to point to when the quarter/annual report needs to come up)?

I am avid backpacker, climber, etc. and have only read about ambassador programs, such as Patagonia's or Arc'teryx's. I don't suspect a whole lot from the commission sales, although we potentially snag  loyal customers from the community that the blogger has surrounded their site with. 

Any help would be great, thanks!

How do I find users/possible-customers  (beta testers initially) in India?

(Why India? One of my reasons is: It's a growth market and people speak English.)

For example, do you know about some popular internet forum in India, where it's
okay to ask for beta users?  Or do you have any other ideas?

Background:

I'd like to ask people in India what they think about new forum software
I'm developing, and find beta testers.  But apparently I cannot come up
with the ""correct"" Google search phrases.

What I'm looking for, is people that want to start their own forums (or blogs
— the software is intended for blogging too). The software hopefully contributes
to fruitful discussions, even when the forum topics (or blog posts) grow to
hundreds of comments. However, people complain that it breaks their habits.
So the users should not be too ""conservative"".  (Should I have include a demo
link here?)

\***

While I'm at it, do you have any quick tips about finding users (beta testers
initially) in China, the Middle East and Africa?

(Currently traffic to my site is mainly from Sweden and the US.)

I work for a small electronics wholesaler. The industry we sell to is very much the national distributor -&gt; local dealer -&gt; end user.  We sell to the national distributors and occasionally to the local dealer. The dealers can get everything they need from the distributors so its an arrangement that has worked out well. The owner of the company has tasked me with aiming our marketing at the dealer level. We have been doing most of our marketing through the distributors. I am the closest thing we have to a marketing person we have since there was never really a need for one, so I got elected until he can find one. He wants to change that so we market to the dealers and drives sales from the middle up instead of from the top down. 

Here is the issue I have. The dealer network is fairly small, consisting of only about 4000 companies across the country. I have about 600 on file. Our distributors obviously don't want to share their customer lists, so that leaves me high and dry on identifying who sells our products. I can search on google for given locations and build the list that way. I've also looked into buying a business list. The results they come back with is over 200,000 listings and would take forever. I'll be making some changes to the websites to try to get dealers to sign up as well as having end users letting me know who they brought them from.

Any good websites or techniques anyone can share to help me locate these customers?

It isn't great, but from what I've seen online it isn't a totally unreasonable level. Anyway, a month ago we launched a new version of our site. Within three days, our bounce rate has gone from that average level to between 0% and 3% per day. Traffic is up about 10% thanks to some Adwords campaigns, but other than that, the only change has been site-side.

I've got a fair amount of experience with web development but we contracted this redesign out to a third party. It's based on WordPress if that makes any difference.

Anyway, I'm at a bit of a loss to explain the drop and a bit suspicious that something is up.

1354121960.0,8,self.marketing,13xvjw,How would you handle the Facebook fan page(s) for a small business with two locations?,glenomenon,10,2,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/13xvjw/how_would_you_handle_the_facebook_fan_pages_for_a/,"We are a small company with two locations. We have a Facebook fan page that was created by a previous employee. We never had the log in info for it, but we weren't really too concerned with Facebook, so we didn't worry about it. But recently we randomly found the log in, so we decided to try to start building it up and using it as a place to interact with active customers. So I've logged in, made myself the admin, and started to post some content. Currently the address listed on the main fan page is ""Town A, State &amp; Town B, State,"" so as to make it as clear as possible that we have two locations.

In addition, we also have two ""Facebook places"" pages (one for each of our locations) that were created by users ""checking-in."" One of these pages has exactly one like, and the other has zero, but both have dozens of ""check-ins."" I've claimed ownership of these pages and given them profile pictures and timeline cover photos, but other than that they're empty.

Trying to cultivate three different fan bases and manage three different Facebook pages seems like a poor strategy. So what should I do instead? It seems like my options are:

* Ideally I'd like to wrap up both location addresses into the main fan page so that people can check in from either location to that main page, but so far my research suggests this isn't possible. If anyone knows a way to do this, I will look upon you as one looks upon a god.

* Choose one of the location addresses and make that the address on the main fan page. From what I've read, this will then absorb that location's places page into the main page, and allow people to check in from that location to the main page. But this will make it unclear on the main page that we have two locations, and doesn't solve the problem of what to do with the other places page. Do I try to manage it separately, leave it alone, or altogether delete it?

* Leave the main page as is, untethered to either physical address. But again, what do I do with the other places pages? Manage them separately, leave them alone, or delete them?

I like the idea of people being able to check in and share our business with their friends, but I don't like the idea of that creating a link to an unmanaged secondary page with few or no likes. If I do end up deleting the places pages, will they just be recreated the next time somebody checks in? What would you do?

**TL;DR** Small business with two locations. Have a main fan page we created ourselves, and two ""places"" pages created by users checking in. Ideally would like to wrap all three pages up into one. If this isn't possible, what should I do instead?

Each year we host a volleyball tournament between all the sororities to raise money for the local Special Olympics location. We raise on average about $10,000 each year, but I know we can raise significantly more if we are much more organized. The actual event isn't until next semester in the spring, but I am getting a head start on everything now.

In the past, we relied solely on local businesses sponsoring the event as well as using direct mail to ask for donations. We require each active member (currently have 157) to supply at least 5 addresses of family members that we can mail letters to (not everyone submits their addresses, but they are fined $10/address which is donated towards Special Olympics). We also do a few press releases in local newspapers to raise awareness.

Here's what I am doing this year:

I am creating a website that tells people about our philanthropy and will allow for anyone to make a donation of whatever amount through the site. I am in the process of creating the website and have the donation process all set up, but I am looking for some ways that I can increase the sites visibility across my campus and on the internet in general. I have created a twitter account that I plan on tweeting from on a regular basis. 

Additionally, I am making the letters look much more professional as well as personal than they have in the past and possibly considering finding more addresses to mail to.

Having seen some great advice given here in the past, I was hoping I could get your guys' insight and ideas on ways I can better market this, not only on campus but online as well.

Many conversions end up happening because while checking out customers open a new window and search ""YOURSTORE coupons"" they check around, try some coupons, get one they are satisfied with and check out. Now you just lost another percentage of your sale because you have to pay: retailmenot, coupon cabin, or some small niche blog a commission.

Now don't get me wrong - there are probably occasions where an affiliate, especially a niche affiliate with a great blog following, brings in an incremental sale - a customer that may have never heard of you before - or first got your name out to a customer. But for the bulk of sales - I've got to believe 75% or more of commissions are being spent on bargain hunting coupon code affiliates.

I am opening up this discussion and would love anyone with incite - anyone worked with a company that didn't have an affiliate program and opened one up? How were the results? Tons of incremental? Or only a little bit and paying tons of commissions?

How about the other way around - anyone out there get rid of their affiliate program? Did you see your overall revenue numbers dive? Or did were you not affected at all.

Arguments for an affiliate program:
- Every major retailer has one (horrible argument IMO)
- Could lose customers looking for coupons during purchase
- Could lose incremental sales from blogs &amp; other affiliates

Arguments against affiliate programs:
- The amount of incremental revenue is negligible considering commissions being paid out
- Marketing dollars could be spent elsewhere for better ROI
- X% of revenue from affiliates comes from customers already on your site looking for coupons

I'm an engineering student looking to makret myself for internships. Last year I took quite a few notes and noticed that everyone was doing mostly the same thing, droping a resume shooting the shit, and moving onto the next booth. I decided I need to seperate myself from the fools who only go to school and have a 4.0 and not work full time to make ends meet. I'm going to do this by droping portfolios of my work instead of just a resume or CV like the others are doing. I've built a portfolio site and programmed solutions to most of the engineering bits of it, so in addition to the portfolio, I'm thinking of including a small flash drive with the executables and source on them inside the portfolio. I'm doing this based off of my time contract welding, I'd TIG 2 coke cans together infront of a prospect after they read my contract bid. It always worked.  

So

*Goodprice (you are paying a right price for the kind of product you want, example: good price $500 for an iPad, bad price $500 for a Discman)
*Good design.
*Ease of access (can be obtained easily).

I would like to know from anyone who has experience with or knowledge about seminars, what makes a successful seminar? That is, what sort of techniques sell tickets and fill the seats?

I've already done a little mini-review, and it looks like the following things can help:    
 * Book reviews and spots on shows that the participants (or their bosses) watch    
 * Personal branding based on a (well-known) name    
 * Comparisons to classics in the field (e.g., Strunk and White)    
 * Referring to it as a ""course""    
 * Quotes referring to the presenter as ""world's leading ... of ..."" or comparing him to a prominent historical figure    

Are any of these relevant? It seems like the way to go is first draw acclaim for his book and the skills and techniques it teaches, and *then* leverage that in the seminar marketing. Is this necessary, though?

I manage my company's Facebook page, we are launching a new brand within a few months and so I have been working with the new brand's facebook page along with other social media profiles to build our social media presence and create a following of people who would be interested in our products. I have created some facebook ads with an offer to entice people to like our page and it seemed to be working quite well. Then suddenly our likes went through the roof one weekend, I wasn't sure why but I wasn't complaining until I started looking at some of the profiles of the people liking our page and realized most of them were obviously ""fake"" profiles. I then realized that almost half of my page's likes were from Bangladesh, which I assumed was where all of these fake profile likes were coming from. After realizing this I quickly limited the page to U.S. only and this seemed to stop the huge influx of fake profiles liking the page. The problem is that once this happened my page's posts have been severely limited to around 2-4% reach. I figured this is probably because of all of the strange activity with the large influx of likes from Bangladesh which probably created a large red flag to Facebook.

My question is, what can I do now? My page has almost 2,000 likes but almost have of those were from Bangladesh and are fake accounts, which apparently Facebook is punishing me for and of course they offer no easy way of removing them from my page. I would literally have to individually go through all 2,000 fans, go to their page, determine if they're real or fake and then ban them. So, I'm now at a point where I'm questioning whether I should just start from scratch (which would mean completely throwing away the months of hard work gaining almost 1,000 fans and the money I spent on ads) or just keep on with the page I have now, keep trying to gain legit fans, ban fake ones in my down time and hope that Facebook doesn't punish me forever.

Has anyone dealt with something like this, know how this happened or have any advice for me?

We also have a small stock of 300 units, and make much more as needed.  My main questions are:

1. What is the best way to determine your customer niche/demographic?

2. How do you get a product in front of these groups (whether online or physically in person)?

3. What are some marketplaces you can cheaply sell your product during the launch phase?  We are considering Amazon/Ebay, but are wondering if there are better ones out there for entrepreneurs.

4. What is the best way to price a product?  Our sale price is very high right now, but it's necessary to cover our costs.  Does it make more sense to lower it and take a loss on each unit sold until we can order in higher volumes and achieve a lower cost per unit?

5. Not a question, but any general advice/encouragement on launching a product from those who've been there would be welcomed!

To introduce myself, I play guitar for a band called [Xombie](http://www.reverbnation.com/xombie)  We have an opportunity to play at [The Bamboozle Festival](http://2012.thebamboozle.com/)

My goal, as we are an unsigned band, is to increase our reach and get as many people familiar with the band as possible over the 3 day festival.  There will be roughly 85,000 people in attendance and we will be playing one of the last two days of the festival.  We are set up with a tent and an area to sell merch.  

So far, my plan includes 7000 stickers that will essentially be our introductory materials that will be handed out by the 5 band members and street team.  Each sticker is a different variation of the main logo and they are all really nice and good quality.

So here's my kicker, I'm getting 3ft beachballs that we are going to spray paint with our logo (vinyl paint, hopefully it works).  The beachballs are black and what is more visible at a concert than a beachball?  We're getting 50-100 of those and will have at least one bouncing during each of the performances on the many stages.  

My question to you is, what other creative (inexpensive) ideas do you have that we can incorporate to increase the number of people who have had some introduction to Xombie and will act on their interaction in the future?

I was wondering what r/marketing (and I will be asking r/finance as well) thought about both professions in terms of education and post-grad job opportunities.

From my research, I am interested in both because they involve planning and implementing strategies based on data. I'm more creative than mathematical (and only did averagely in calculus/vectors in high school), so I am leaning towards marketing, but I'm often told that marketing does not lead to many job opportunities after graduation. I also have some minor experience in the graphic design industry and make many graphics for clubs and newspapers (as well as newspaper layouts) around campus. Even though I am more interested in marketing, I am wondering if perhaps it's better to have a background in finance.

Is it possible to move between the two, or are they distinct enough that taking a degree in either restricts me to that industry? My (Canadian) school has both majors listed as ""specialist"" ones, so I don't believe I can double major in both of them.

So I was wondering, what do you guys think of pursuing marketing over finance?",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_ovv29,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/ovv29/should_i_major_in_marketing_or_finance/,

I run a company that specializes in fairly high end marketing/sales videos. We've been very fortunate to have wonderful clients that keep returning, but I feel bad for the companies/freelancers who just don't have the budget for our services.

Camera technology these days is remarkable. Any of my directors could take a $350 camcorder and make a beautiful HD video with it. In this field, technology no longer bars people, it empowers people.

I'm imagining a service where the average Joe marketing director, small business owner, or freelancer could shoot a video, send it in, fill out a web form that would outline their goals for the video, have it reviewed by our directors, marketing strategists, and content writers, and receive a personalized report about how to make the video way better. Something that would cover the following:

* Technical (lighting, composition, etc)
* Marketing (Content, positioning, etc)
* Directing (How to stand, etc)

It seems something like this for $50 would be really empowering for companies that can't afford a $5,000 video. Even for projects that just don't need that kind of horsepower.

Any thoughts? Does this sound useful? I greatly appreciate any insight you can provide.

(I feel like when I can actually -find- people that are interested in my services, I am very good about keeping them. The problem is finding those people that are in need of a Realtor)


So some quick background info on me: I am 20-years old and have been in the business since I was 18, and worked a year prior as an assistant. I did fairly well for myself living in a military town with a fairly large sphere of influence and a lot of referral business that came from working with my mother. I feel like all of my customers have been extremely satisfied and I try to value myself on my customer service.

Fast-forward to ~three weeks ago I moved to a new city where I know nobody, twice the population, and fairly tourist centric which makes it a wildly different market. I spent my first week trying to get my license transferred to the new office and familiarising myself with the market, and the second week I tried to send packages to a farming area I picked out. It doesn’t help that the next week I was working on settling in at home, then had to dog-sit at my parent’s house for Thanksgiving but I don’t feel like I am getting anywhere right now with my business.

Tomorrow I plan on visiting some upscale hotels in the area and leaving packages with the concierge but after that I’m a little out of creative ideas.


So my question for you is this— What are some ideas you may have to help me reach out to potential customers? What are some suggestions you may have for me to be a better agent, in general?

* Cook quiches to create a value-added product
* Use a sandwich board on the highway, despite regulations
* Engage locally-based online forum, hoping to create a customer base

I know you guys have some great ideas, so I figured I'd ask away. I really appreciate any tips you can give me.",,False,,t5_2qhmg,False,,,True,t3_ern3h,http://www.reddit.com/r/marketing/comments/ern3h/im_trying_to_market_my_music_im_not_signed_but_i/,

What better place to ask this question than right here on reddit?

**Things I've tried:**

1. Direct Mail (handwritten envelopes)
2. Dropping Business Cards in baggies.
3. Simply asking for referrals from happy clients (typically before I leave their house during an appointment)
4. Newspaper
5. Craigslist
6. kululu, misc. other craigslist esque sites.
7. Being listed on google under computer repair

**Things that've worked:**

1. Craigslist (but less and less these days)
2. Referrals
3. (Kinda) dropping business cards
4. (Sorta Kinda) Listed under google

**One thing I'm considering:**

**Postcards or Doorhangers or Good quality color fliers saying:**

Hey I'll be in your neighborhood on Saturday October whatever, 2010, and because of that I am offering a 100% free no obligation PC Checkup.  Done right at your home.  You'll get a free ""good faith"" estimate of what's wrong.  This Saturday only- call now.  Ask for Jon (xxx)xxx-xxxx


Wondering how I should go about it, if it's a good idea at all, and how to make it not sound like those companies that will ""clean your heater for 40 bucks"" and then always seem to find a hairline fracture in your heating thing, and then essentially fuck you over.

How I hope it'll work:
I'll drop ~1000 of these, get ~1-3% response rate.

I get 10-30 calls.  Each call takes me approx. 20 minutes.  At that thing I can generally get a good idea of what needs to be done and what the cost will be.  I then offer them a pick up / drop off option for ~125 dollars + parts.  (Pay when I drop off of course) Or I can come back tomorrow (or whenever) to do it on site for 75/hour. 

Say half of these people choose to go with me that's ~625 bucks - ~1875 bucks  for the day.  Obviously I need to then go back to my workshop and fix 5-15 computers- but that takes me ~half a day, maybe a day.

**Does this seem viable?  Any general tips?**

**What else can I do to advertise?** Any ideas?  Any college student want to help a fellow college student out?  I can even pay a wage.

**Edit: Of course any general ideas or tips and tricks are completely appreciated.  I also don't mind sharing my experience with it to make it a learning experience.

2. Statistics (ROI, spending reports, email stats)
3. Compare and contrast views (how much print mail are we doing this year vs. last year, comparing Australia office actions vs. Brazil actions)
