This is for entry-level / junior, but I am curious about the work life of all levels, and even those who freelance as I aspire to become a full-time freelancer after several years of working.

I'd just like to hear the stories and experiences of those who have been full time Rails developers, along with a few questions:

What are typical hours like, 9-5? Or is that too optimistic

I am told that the job market for Rails developers is hot right now. I know we can't predict the future, but what educated guesses can we make about the future of Rails and its demand?

Is the work enjoyable? I mean, I do enjoy coding in Ruby, working with Rails and git and all that, but I'm not too sure what to expect in a professional environment.

Any interesting stories and advice will be appreciated as well.

1375590976.0,41,self.rails,1jnylg,I made a screencast of how I do testing in Rails and I'm thinking of turning this into a series. Let me know what you think.,outtascope,44,3,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1jnylg/i_made_a_screencast_of_how_i_do_testing_in_rails/,"[Link here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylbGmkXM5H4&amp;list=PLJ3sdWRfFGmY_4KWuzAAxQznKHwy2qR9o)

I remember almost 2 years ago when I was only starting to learn Ruby on Rails, one of things that I had a hard time learning was how to do testing or TDD/BDD properly. Despite reading books that are about testing, I still couldn't get how to do it beyond the examples that I see. It wasn't until I got a job at a certain Rails shop that I learned how to actually do testing.

As a way to give back to the community and help out the newbies, I made this possible series of screencasts where I just talk to myself while programming. It's completely unscripted and it was done that way on purpose, so you would know how I think and approach the problems that I encounter along the way.

I am not an expert by any means. I still consider myself as an average-skilled programmer, but I do understand how it feels to be a newbie who's frustrated about learning all this stuff.

The first video is 40 minutes long, but I am trying to make the next batch of videos to be 20 minutes on average. I would really appreciate it if you can give me feedback about the whole thing.",,False,,t5_2qhjn,False,,,True,t3_1jnylg,http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1jnylg/i_made_a_screencast_of_how_i_do_testing_in_rails/,

So my web server receives a GET request on port 3000 for ""/"", mapped to document root via the config/routes.rb preloaded along with all other initialization files during starting of the server, right?

Where does Rack exactly come in here?  I get that the protocol for what content to deliver is contained in the controller logic (right?) and the view is served.

Also, I'm under the impression that it's Rails which has access to the database to continually query models via ActiveRecord, so what is Rack doing?

Each individual app would cost me $55 / month, since most of them need SSL and at least one worker dyno. I'd rather spend that money on a decent VPS which could host everything at once.

However, I'm sick of setting up Linux servers manually. I'd just like to have an automatically provisioned, production-ready environment on a single VPS. It should also come with some open-source sysadmin tools pre-installed, so that I can keep track of logs, application errors, CPU usage, free disk space, etc.

Here's a few things I would like to set up: rbenv, git, nginx, passenger, postgres, redis, sendmail, varnish, monit, database set up with passwords and only allowing local sockets, sensible iptables rules, fail2ban, SSH on non-standard port and only allowing non-root public-key auth, users and permissions set up, git deploy hooks configured, an ENV config system similar to Heroku, unnecessary packages uninstalled and unnecessary services disabled. I'd also like to run Sentry (error reporting), logcheck, graphite, collectd. I'd also like to have a Graphite frontend with some pre-configured metrics, such as [Descartes](https://github.com/obfuscurity/descartes), and a summary dashboard built on [Dashing](http://shopify.github.io/dashing/).

For the git deploy hooks, a git push should create the app directory and databases if it's the first push, install Ruby, install gem dependencies, compile assets, set up cron jobs if `config/schedule.rb` exists, and start the app and background job processes. It should also automatically set up SSL and virtual hosts for nginx if my repo contains files like `CNAME`, `server.crt`, `bundle.pem`, and `server.key`.

Setting all of this up manually would take hours, and I'm sure someone must have already automated all of this. So, please let me know if you have a collection of chef recipes or something that you can share. I'd also like to know if you have any suggestions about the stack / tools I've outlined above.

It provides mechanisms for your users to like and dislike one or more models in your app and then (quickly) provides recommendations using Redis. After numerous bugfixes and improvements since I released my first version (0.0.1) back in late January, I made a great change last night that I felt has pushed it to a very usable and overall awesome gem (many of the finders now return ActiveRecord::Relations instead of Arrays. Finally!). It was my first open-source project, so I hope you guys will check it out and leave some feedback!

EDIT: Oops, I also released version 1.1. I had a couple other features that I realized I could implement easily, so I did it. Recommendable now supports Sidekiq, Resque, DelayedJob, and uses Rails::Queueing if you're on edge and haven't bundled one of these other fine gems. Additionally, I've added before/after callbacks for all of the methods that create or destroy a rating, saved item, or ignored item.

Not really sure whether to focus on front-end and back-end development (since I want to learn enough of both to become dangerous, but there's too much to learn), and I'm having a hard time choosing how to tackle a group/stack of the dozens of web languages, technologies, &amp; frameworks out there, mainly because I'm just not too familiar with web app architecture these days.

I'm fascinated by several types of apps:

1) Business-focused SaaS apps that offer great functionality to small business, and ESPECIALLY invisible connector-type apps that sync different software together (i.e. a FreshBooks addon that pushes customers to your Mailchimp email list).

2) Lightweight, ""one-page"" style apps that revolve around lots of Javascript DOM manipulation (i.e. Mingly, Trello, etc) and mainly use JSON objects pulled from external (and my own) APIs. JS MV* frameworks like Backbone, Ember, &amp; Knockout have caught my eye lately.

3) Real-time/nearly real-time apps that involve lots of small pieces of data flying around at any given time (i.e. Stackoverflow, sites with activity feeds, etc). Been reading about MeteorJS/Yahoo Mojito too, and that style of ""Javascript all around"" REALLY appeals to me, especially since web development is moving more towards JS for everything these days.

I've spent the last few weeks digging into RoR and (coming from vanilla PHP) there are lots of things I like about it, but my biggest gripe is that it feels far ""heavier"" than what I need to make simple apps. It feels like it provides backhoes to dig some holes for a garden, when all I need is a small hand shovel (if you see my analogy). If I was going to build large apps with tons of data &amp; features (i.e. Basecamp), I could definitely appreciate it, but I'm focused on small apps right now.

From what I understand, most apps these days are moving towards client-based functionality primarily using JSON objects pulled in from ""JSON pump"" APIs/back end software. To me, it almost makes sense to start by building a base of front-end skills &amp; work with JSON data from other sites, then gradually learn more back-end development to build my own APIs.

I really appreciate more experienced web developers' feedback. This field is so exciting right now, and I just want to learn it all, but I know that's not possible. Given that I'm quitting my job to learn new skills, I'd like to focus on a stack that's going to provide me with a nice base skillset to build my career upon.

Thanks again in advance!

I loved the book and thought it was an excellent way to learn the basics, but I'm wondering if I'm making a mistake by continuing to emulate aspects of it.

For example, the authentication system.  I know there are gems for this, but I've been building them the way it's built in the book (I figure that doing it more than once will help solidify how it works in my mind).  Is it suitable for real-world applications?

Another area I'm wondering about is testing.  I've been writing the same basic tests that are outlined in the tutorial.  Of course, I add tests to cover additional features and whatnot, but they're still pretty similar.   

I'm wondering about this because I'm helping a friend build a web-based UI for a desktop application he wrote.  He has customers using the desktop version, so I assume he'll have some using the web-based version before long, and I want to make sure I build something usable.  Performance isn't a concern, but reliability, maintainability, and ability to add features definitely are.

I'd like to fully grasp these concepts so my head doesn't hurt anymore.

I'm used to dealing with an ORM like active record. When I imagine my user objects through rails I picture an object of a person being related to a row in the people table. Ok basic.

So, I read that non-relational databases like mongodb aren't just cool because they're ""fast with big data"" but they're also cool because they apparently make developing more natural with an oop language (why?). Then I also read that most design patterns probably aren't truly relational. Ok, this is where I get lost.

1) What are some fundamental examples of relational design and non-relational design? 2) similar to above, what are examples of structured data vs unstructured (is this just rephrasing above?)

So, given those things I feel (in my immediate ignorance) that almost every type of project I've attempted to model against has been relational. But maybe I'm just using semantics over technicality. For example, posts and comments. Relational to each other. Add users in there. it seems most apps these days have data that is always useful to reach through other data/objects. That's relational isn't it?

How about something describing something less typical.

Let's say I was building a workout tracker app. I have users, exercises, workouts, routines and log_entries.

I create a routine to group workouts. A workout is a group of exercises. I record my reps and weight through log entries for my exercises. Is this relational data or non relational? Would mongo be great for modeling this or awful?

I hear things like statistics come into play. How does that affect the above example? What statistics are people usually speaking of?

Let's say I added tracking other things, like a users weight, height, body fat and so on. How does that affect things?

Thank you for taking the time to help me understand.

Edit: can anyone explain why it may be easier to develop for one over the other. Is using something like mongo more agile both because it ""clicks"" more once you ""ge it"" and also because you don't need to run migrations?

Another thing, when using an abstraction like an ORM - does it really matter? If so when? To me the initial value would be the ease of querying data and modeling my objects. Whatever lets me do that easier is what I'd be happy with.

I am a long time coder that has been hoarding all the source I have worked on since the late 90s. Maintaining these backups is becoming rather laborious in my ever increasingly shorter life so I've decided to release all my Ruby on Rails applications to the public.

List of applications:

*RecipeTrees* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/recipetrees), [website](http://recipetrees.com)

RecipeTrees is a recipe database but with a twist: a user can clone/fork (yes, I am coding geek) a recipe for alteration and the website keeps track of all forks via an acyclic graph. Other features include: nutritional value calculation and inclusion of recipes within recipes (I haven't tried going too deep into this so not sure how far away limbo is). Stopped coding in late 2011.

*Parlmnt* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/parlmnt), [website](http://parlmnt.com)

Parlmnt scrapes Bills and Legislation information from [Parliament.uk](http://parliament.uk) and presents it in a more debatable manner. Secondary objective is to provide scrapped data via a JSON/XML api. This is mostly a Backbone.js application with the Rails acting as nothing more than an API server with all rendering being done via Backbone views and DustJS. Still coding but is in early alpha. Helpers welcome.

*MediaCMS* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/MediaCMS), [website](http://pantherfotos.com)

My first Rails project started in 2006! I continued hacking on it till early 2010. MediaCMS is a full blown commercial media library supporting: photo/video/audio uploads with background process that convert from pretty much any format to required format for viewing and playback. Several e-commerce mechanisms available for media up-loaders (i.e. price per image size, audio sample rates etc). This is a large Rails project clocking in at about 17,000 LOC.

*DarkFallSage* - [source](https://github.com/nazar/DarkFallSage), website (he's dead, Jim)

DarkFallSage is a mapwow.com type website aimed at the DarkFall MMO. Interesting features include: custom Google Maps tiles that use the game world map to overlay loot/mob information; mob/loot database; support for clans to manage own public/private forums; skill trees; discussions on each game item/skill. Stopped coding in 2010.

*Waster* - aka TheLastBunker.com - [source](https://github.com/nazar/wasters), website (she's dead, Jim)

Wasters, similar to DarkFallSage, was aimed at the Fallen Earth MMO, considered by many to be SW Galaxies spiritual successor in terms of its crafting mechanism. Wasters was developed to primarily catalogue crafted items, not too dissimilar from the Bill of Materials shipping problem. I re-invented the wheel on this one by figuring out the Materialised Path pattern in order to model all the assemblies. Stopped coding in 2010.

I hope these are useful, even to just extract snippets of code.

Live long and prosper.

Linode
-Looks cheap
-Extendable
-No experience with it
-May be overkill?
-Needs a lot of maintenance?

Heroku
-More expensive (I think?)
-Very easy to deploy(I think?)
-I don't really understand dynos and why they are a better alternative, they wind down right? Does this mean I'll have to use a script to keep the dyno running?

Basically I just have a little portfolio I wanted to upload which I think would suit Heroku perfectly as I wouldn't expect much traffic and could probably survive on the free dyno. With that said I'd eventually like to maybe offer my limited skills on a freelance basis and wasn't sure which was the best route to go. I don't want to have to spend loads of time maintaining versions as a sysadmin. Then again what if someone didn't want a rails app? Is Wordpress as easy to deploy?

Everything works fine and the notice is displayed properly, but for some reason (perhaps because it's a 302 redirect?), the user is still prompted to re-post the data if s/he refreshes the index page and if s/he agrees, a duplicate object is created. Does anyone else redirect to the index page after creating an object? I could redirect_to the show action and then redirect_back to the index action while preserving the notice, but that seems pretty silly. I'm not sure what the best Rails way to deal with this is.

Here is the pertinent part of my pages_controller.rb

    # POST /pages
    # POST /pages.json
    def create
      @page = Page.new(params[:page])

      if @page.save
        redirect_to pages_path, notice: ""#{@page.name} was successfully created.""
      else
        render action: ""new""
      end
    end

EDIT: Blah sorry this is a Chrome bug. I can't believe how much time I wasted on this. I'll leave this up here on the way-off chance that it helps anyone.

We're currently in the phase of learning the ins and outs of our technology stack for this endeavor - we've settled on using Rails with Apache, PostgreSQL, Phusion Passenger, and will be setting this all up on a Linode VPS.  We've successfully installed the necessary packages to do local development.  We're all familiar and comfortable with using git, and have a private Github account set up for our group projects.  This leads into my current issue...

I've taken it upon myself to essentially be the system administrator for our Linode VPS, as I have the most experience in our group in terms of dealing with sysadmin tasks.  However, this is my first time setting up a production server for Rails.  I'm looking for advice primarily on what more experienced Rails devs would recommend in regards to the following:

* Should every dev have a user account on the VPS?  Or is it necessary and sufficient to just set up one user account that deals with/is associated with all the Rails stuff, like RVM, Passenger, Apache, PostgreSQL, etc, and then to just share login credentials for this account with all the devs in my group?  I saw that RVM can be installed as a multiple user setup, but I don't know if that's necessary for our purposes.

* Not having used it yet, is Capistrano sufficient to deploy an app and have it automatically run in production mode, or is there further tinkering involved to set the app to production once it's been pushed to the VPS by Capistrano?

Sorry for the long post, I'd just like to get things right the first time if possible!  Any other suggestions and tips will be greatly appreciated!  Thanks in advance everyone.

So, something like this: V ↔ C ← M

But rails seems to promote direct access of the model from the view.

I believe it's what makes rails conceptually simpler to use compared to ASP .NET because you get to work directly with your data in your views.

But it breaks the MVC model.

And then I find it especially ironic that while ASP .Net does follow the MVC architecture (.aspx is view, databinds and codebehind make up the controller and Entity Framework is the model), Microsoft has build something called ASP .Net MVC which is not MVC.

What Ryan (the guy behind railscasts) has done is simply amazing, and he has no doubt influenced the community in a huge way. I know I for one have gained so much from his work, and I absolutely feel he should be able to make a living doing what he wants.

Ryan started asking $9/mo for ""Pro"" subscribers. New episodes are now typically for said subscribers though some free ones will likely remain to be produced. 

I'm sure for many, $9/mo is no problem and a no-brainer. It's easily justifiable when it boosts the quality and speed of the work you yourself do. 

When I was laid off last year, I took it as an opportunity to learn web development with rails, and railscasts has been nothing short of instrumental to my learning in addition to reading what I can. But being on a fixed income, i can't justify $9/mo when i still struggle to keep my bank account in the positive. (I also don't like 'what was once free is now paid', and prefer a more reddit-like model where you just get extra on top and pay because you want to support)

This isn't to say that i would never pay **A** monthly fee, or a per episode fee, because that would imply that it holds no value at all, which is simply untrue. 

~

(TL;DR) So with that in mind... here's what i'm curious about

* If you don't pay for $9/mo for railscasts, what would be a monthly rate that you WOULD pay? 
* At what point would it be too much for you? (i.e. $10/mo, $15?)
* If you were asked to asses the value of an episode after watching it, from $.10-$10, which then got added to a cart that you could 'checkout' after maybe watching a few, how would that impact what you're willing to pay?

~

In the end, Ryan can put whatever price tag he wants on what he does. Railscasts is just a great example of content clearly worth $ and i'm curious how others would asses it's value. 


**Edit:** a few people seem to be missing the point. I'm asking what you would pay. Clearly his stuff is of value... how much, and in what way should compensation be made from his users? see bullet points above. If it's not worth anything to you, why even watch it? 

** Edit: ** Ryan will still be producing a free one weekly. Some redditors take issue with my ""what was once free is now paid"" blip... should not at all be the take away from this post.

I've used Heroku exclusively since I started with Rails a few years ago, because it's very easy to deploy and the free tier is usually good enough for my apps.  The school site can get up to 3000 hits a week, which is not the problem: the problem is I can reliably crash the app by telling all the kids in the computer lab to go to it.

Adding another dyno for $35/month is pretty steep compared to zero.  Especially when I'm not sure if that would fix it, given [the talk about Heroku lately](http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/18i946/herokus_ugly_secret_by_james_somers_of_rapgenius/).  Not knowing anything about hosting architecture, my question is: which hosts would best handle low traffic with occasional surges at under $10/month?  Agile, git-based deployments a plus.

    &lt;% @tags = [] %&gt;
    &lt;% ActsAsTaggableOn::Tag.all.each do |tag| %&gt;
      &lt;% @tags &lt;&lt; tag.name %&gt;

**Then below:**

    &lt;script&gt;
      $(document).ready( function () {
      $(""#YOURMODEL_tag_list"").select2({tags:[

His answer is that he believes that the architecture of the site must be bad since modifying one part of the site (which might involve an addition to a model) can cause a bug in another part of the system. He thinks it's bad architectural design because the code for each part of the system is not isolated from the other parts. He is a business guy and not a programmer.

This project constantly has steep deadlines so unless I worked in my off-time for FREE (he won't pay for testing) this system will continue to piss him off and be untested. What should I do here???

I've hated it and have come to realise that a lot of it has to do with how bad the scaffolded defaults are. E.g. just moving the: 

     respond_to do |format|
        format.html
        format.json { render json: blah }
      end

into its own method within the application controller for the @60% of cases where it suffices. I'm sat here now going over the views, moving button sets into their own partials...and I have nearly 20 forms to do this with. It sucks.

Better scaffolding (e.g. haml by default) would have helped immensely, as would know beforehand what I was likely to DRY up which got me wondering if there are some standard approaches that seasoned pros take (or if I'm just missing something BIG that everyone moves onto).

Any tips?

(p.s. I should probably say that I'm working with rails 3.2; any improvements with 4?)

I thought I did pretty well given the time limit, but they got back to my recruiter saying they were 'not happy with the standard of my code'. They also said I did things in a non-Rails way, and wrote unnecessary code. But they didn't explicitly tell me what was wrong.

That hurt a bit, but I am trying to learn. Here's the little app:

For example, let's say I have form setup for a remote script, something like this.
**./app/views/entries/show.html.erb:**

    &lt;p&gt;
      &lt;b&gt;Comments:&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;div id=""comments""&gt;
        &lt;%= render @entry.comments %&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    
      &lt;%= form_tag :action =&gt; :add_comment, :remote =&gt; true do %&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
          Comment: &lt;%= text_area_tag :body %&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
          &lt;%= submit_tag ""Add Comment"", :id =&gt; @post.id %&gt;
        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;% end %&gt;
    &lt;/p&gt;

Then, in the controller, I have something like this:

**./app/contollers/entries_controller.rb:**
    
    class EntryController &lt; ApplicationController
      respond_to :json, :only =&gt; :add_comment
    
      def add_comment
    	@entry = Entry.find(params[:id])
    
        @comment = @entry.comments.create(:body =&gt; params[:body])
    
        respond_with @comment do |format|
          format.js
        end
      end
    end
    
Assume everything works up through the action and the comment gets created in the list of comments for the entry. I have no problem debugging and refining the model because I can use the interactive ruby console.

Let's say by some dumb mispelling or something I don't have the script in the right place or I've mispelled the filename or something: the script I want to respond with from add_comment to dynamically update the view doesn't work. Here's where I'm not sure where to go. *Keep in mind, this is hypothetical. I don't want to know what I've done wrong; I want to learn how to debug it*

When I try to test this, I get nothing. There is no helpful message in the console and nothing is returned to the browser. So, what would be the next step to figuring out why the script isn't getting returned?

In general, I'm looking for some guidance on general debugging suggestions for RAILS, if that even makes sense.

I'm fine with a challenge, but I'm wondering if I'm in over my head.  I'm also wondering where's a good place to get help, if I need to steer management in a different direction, etc.

More details:

My experience is limited.  I've forked the project and have made some minor changes to the application and the database structure (e.g. messed around with some active record validations, views, controller actions, etc.).  I haven't struggled too much, but items on my to-do list are becoming a bit more difficult.  I have looked at a few Rails guides (guides.rubyonrails.org, why's poignant guide) but my learning stops there.

This application isn't huge, but it's not entirely straightforward either.  It's basically a survey application (staff interviews some person in-person) with some tricky yes/no conditional logic and scoring.  Companies sign up to use our system and interview people, so each company is kept separate for scoring/reporting purposes.

We're having performance issues with the application.  Currently, some surveys take up to 10 seconds to load, and the ""dashboard"" can take just as long.  This is on production hardware.  I have no idea why this is the case... probably something inefficient in the way they work with the database or partial views.  All I know is this is going to come back to haunt me in the future, especially once we get clients.  The third party is working to resolve these performance issues.  Their goal is to make it so we can pass a security vulnerability test (SQL injection, XSS, and whatnot) provided by yet another company.  Interestingly, our rails app crashes under load from one concurrent connection from the testing servers.  That doesn't make me comfortable either.

This application also stores information that falls under HIPAA.  Just one more reason for me to be worked up.

One of my friends also cleverly pointed out that I work for an internet company that has only one web developer/sysadmin/knowledgable computer person.  That's me.  (Less than a dozen work here.)

So, I don't entirely know where to go from here.  I'm not sure if it's smart to have me be solely responsible for the development of this project.  Maybe we need to hire another person.  Maybe we just need to pay someone to give me help when I need it (ideas where to go/what to do to find a person to work with under those terms?)  Maybe I just need a bunch of books.  I don't know, but I'd personally be extremely grateful for any suggestions thrown my way.",,False,,t5_2qhjn,False,,,True,t3_nb48t,http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/nb48t/ive_acquired_a_rails_project_and_need_some/,

I work with very large game studios that you've definitely heard of, down to start-ups in stealth mode that have two employees. RoR seems to be a tricky skill-set to peg, and so I wanted to reach out to you guys as I can't imagine asking a better group of people what they think of recruiters, and pick your brains as far how I could do my job better, and rather than be annoying, be as helpful as possible, which is truly the approach I try and take.

Personally, I've been on the receiving side of being bombarded by recruiters, and I understand how annoying we can be. I've definitely taken my experience and try to be as pleasing as possible. I don't call people and try to pitch them jobs right off the bat, and am usually just plain curious as to hear what kind of projects people are working on and see when they might consider start looking for a new job - usually very casual conversations, basically shoot the breeze with the talent I reach out to. I try and figure out what makes them tic, and if something comes across my desk that might be of interest to them, I'll reach out and let them know. I hated when recruiters would call me and try to shove a job down my throat, so I've pretty much taken the exact opposite approach.

So yeah, not sure what your experience with recruiters is, but would love to hear some feedback/tips. Also - hehe - if any of you guys are trying to get involved in the video game space, or are in the space already, and are trying to advance in you careers (specialty of mine, if I might say so, getting talent compensation/title increase) PM me and we can take it from there.

Hopefully, I am just missing something here.  An example: when I sit down to code up a class, I think in terms like so:
    
    class Address
      attr_accessor :number, :street
      def initialize(number, street)
        @number = number
        @street = street

Instead, it seems (from the books I am looking at), that I have to think in terms of simple type fields and then build a flat object model around those.

I have developed a couple of small internal Rails apps so far. However I have never setup a solid production environment to run them in. In other words I always run them using 1 mongrel (e.g. rails script/server RAILS_ENV=production) instance.

But this won't be enough if I want to write a public Rails web app. And I don't have any experience using Apache or Nginx.

If I get a VPS hosting somewhere and I want to deploy my app to it, what steps should I take?

TBH I cant really think of what would make my current experience with TextWrangler any better.  I am really just wondering if there is something awesome that I am missing.

Say I create a category or item type for ""Pumps"".  I want the user to be able to add in multiple Pumps.  They might have to fill out fields for ""flow rate"", ""pipe size"", etc.

But then I might have a item type for ""Generators"".  They might enter in multiple generators that have required fields for ""voltage"", ""max load"", etc.

The admin interface would allow creation of these item types and what fields they will have.

How can I best structure my models to allow this sort of dynamic behavior?  I surely don't want to create a model/table for each item type.

* create authentication system using a gem
* add Facebook authentication support
* add Twitter authentication support
* create basic layout
* create basic views
* create an administration panel for leaders
* create a emailing system to keep you users informed

1320261198.0,8,self.rails,ly0br,Integration with legacy ASP.NET Application - Authentication Question?,akira410,8,0,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/ly0br/integration_with_legacy_aspnet_application/,"I have recently been tasked with rewriting an ASP.NET (VB) Application in rails.

Unfortunately, I do not really have the options of creating a new mysql/postgres/whatever database and writing a script to bring the old sqlserver data more inline with the rails way of things.

Due to the fact that there are a lot of various applications/tools used in the office that still point to the database, I need to do all of the rails stuff through the existing sqlserver database.

That's resolved easily enough with the proper gems and liberal use of views and/or alias_attribute commands. 

However, the authentication of the existing webapp uses ASP.NET Forms Authetnication.  This consists of several tables including: aspnet_User, aspnet_Membership, aspnet_Roles, aspnet_userInRoles, etc. 

I have managed to write the roles up to the user account but I can't seem to figure out the most appropriate way to hook up the authentication.

Here's where things get weird:


    Table:
    client_Data  
    
    Columns: client_Num(autoinc PK), userID (this is a GUID/Uniqueidentifier), and various other things like first/last name, etc.

    Table:
    aspnet_Users  (part of Forms Auth)
    Columns: UserID (the GUID from above), UserName

    Table:
    aspnet_Membership  (parts of FOrms Auth)
    Columns: USerID (GUID), Password, a few other fields.

So, my problem is essentially the fact that user authetnication information is spread over three tables.  Clients, holding basic information about the person, a Users table which maps a non-primary-key but unique GUID field to a username, and then a Membership table that links the same GUID with a password.

I can ghetto code this into working, but I'd like to know if anyone has any experiencing dealing with this specific scenario or ... anyone who has any ideas that may make me hate myself a little less.

My current thought on the solution to the problem is a class method on the User class called 'authenticate' which will accept a username and a password.  This method will then query the database with a three table join (or a custom view) to determine if the username/password combination is correct.  If so, it will retrieve the Client_Num (nonstandard PK name) and load the instance of the model if successful.  Otherwise, I'll just reject the user.  

I'm not really sure if that's the best way to go about it, though, or if there's a cleaner way.


		def authenticate(username, password)
		    User.joins(""inner join aspnet_Users on aspnet_Users.UserID = client_Data.UserID"").joins(""inner join aspnet_Membership on aspnet_Membership.UserID = client_Data.UserID"").where([""aspnet_Users.username = ? AND aspnet_Membership.password = ?"", username, password]).first
		end

New here and really excited the subreddit exists! No idea why I didn't know this.

Anyways, Ive been a full-time freelancer for 10+ years. I consider myself very experienced and well-rounded in design, html/css3, e-commerce, CMS's, user experience and much more.

The one thing that has always held me back is requiring a programmer every time I have a great idea that will need more than one of the content management systems can handle. Things end up taking way to long with unreliable people and I want to be 100% self-reliant.

Im getting ready to take 2 months off work to focus on learning RoR/jQuery the entire time but I'm having real trouble decided where to start that will be practical for the type of sites I make. I'm nervous I will waste a lot of time learning things I will never end up using in the long run and wasting a lot of time.

I mainly only develop database driven type websites such as:

-A Restaurant directory where people can sign up and list their place with reviews, maps, etc.
-A freebie website where people can download and submit free templates (something like flypixel.com) - Perhaps have a premium section
-A desktop wallpaper site

I would love to pay a programmer to come to my house and program a website I give him right in front of me and explain what he is doing the whole time.

Maybe Im over thinking this and just need to start where everyone else has recommended? Perhaps I will be able to do all of that regardless of which guides I follow.",,False,,t5_2qhjn,False,,,True,t3_1ih3d8,http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/1ih3d8/where_to_start_thats_practical_for_my_goals/,

* Using passenger for staging environment only.  I'm using capistrano for deployment so I'd hate to have to write another set of recipes specifically for using passenger.

I've only ever used Capistrano to deploy locally before, and my first attempt at deploying over SSH is giving me trouble. 

Firstly, it seems to be creating folders on the remote server with root ownership and insufficient permissions for the webserver. That's manually fixable, but still obviously an issue.

Secondly, when it comes to actually pushing the data over, Git just immediately starts complaining in a way that suggests Capistrano is asking for data that's not there (I'm not up on anything beyond fairly basic Git usage, sorry).

Can anyone tell me what the process for setting up SSH deployment is? The actual SSH part - getting it to successfully connect and run commands - is working fine, so I'm not sure what's different that could be breaking things so badly.

I understand that if all of the authors were in a single table, it would be easy to print the bug's author in the view via bug.author.name. However, if these live in the same table as client and contact, how do I differentiate between each?

I'm assuming it would be in the model definition for member; my eventual goal is to be able to print a bug's author/client/contact names using bug.author.name, bug.client.name, etc. while all three of those object types live in the same table, members.

Let's say I start by creating a user registration screen/domain, I will only add the essential ( username and password and no validation) after that I will move on to the next piece of functionality and do the essential, once I have all the functionality I need, I will go back and do another iteration and add the rest of the fields and validation needed in the user registration screen/domain, once it is done I move to the next piece of functionality and add what I left out.

The other way I have done it, for example, I won't move to the next piece of functionality until, I complete the one I am working on (for example, the user registration screen/bean with all the field and validation)

Ive been playing around with rails3 for a bit now, and got to the point id like to test it live, and being a newbie I'm having kinda hard time on picking hosting company. At the moment I have shared hosting plan with hostgator, but it only supports rails 2.3.5. Alternative would be getting virtual server with them, but I will have to install/set up everything myself, which don't seem to be a bad thing, as its nice to know how. The question I'm trying to ask is there better alternative to hostgators virtual server level 1 plan, hardware wise and price wise, I'm not cheap, but I am broke.

I did a bit research on the listed companies on rubyonrails.org(Joyent, Brightbox, Blue Box Group, Slicehost, Linode) and my current hostgator, and come up with 2 that seemed to me be most reasonable:

Hostgator - CPU: 0.56GHz, Storage: 10gb, Ram: 384mb, Bandwidth: 250gb, Price: $19.95

Linode -CPU: ?, Storage: 16gb, Ram: 512, Bandwidth: 200gb, Price: $20 - In my opinion seems like better choice, but I'm not sure how cpu works there.

Is there anything better within same price range? And what would be best option for newbie to go with?

Pepper this workflow with a few searches on Stack Overflow, some cut/paste of magic syntax off random blogs and you begin to get the idea.

Are there resources / experienced freelancers out there who would be willing to do a detailed code review and suggest improvements on an entire existing application. 

While what I have works, I get a fairly decent idea about the optimality of individual components (such as the usage of devise) from what I can glean off the internet.  

It is hard for me to tell the forest from the trees and would be greatly interested in atleast one experienced reviewer taking the application apart with a detailed code review and telling me whether I am on the right track or hideously wrong.

At the outcome of such an exercise, I would expect to have a punch list of items ""TODO"", improve and otherwise strengthen. It would be lesson all by itself.

Does such services exist anywhere?  At a reasonable cost, I would tend to view one such exercise as an investment for the sake of quality.

PS: My day job (for a long time now) involves software for embedded systems and even some work with a few safety critical systems (i.e. 500 internal server errors are nothing compared to the cost and ramifications of what would happen when a bug goes past testing in some embedded applications that I am intimately acquainted with).

So you create assignment objects and a nice set of features that allows them to create and track them.

Then suppose your admin users say, that's great, but we often assign 10 to 15 widgets to the same user at the same time, can we assign multiple widgets at once.

Then say you first tack a controller method onto your WidgetAssignmentController called batch create, and make the necessary forms.

You then refactor that to a separate controller called WidgetAssignmentBatchesController like the one below.
       
    class WidgetAssignmentBatchesController &lt; ApplicationController
    
      def create
        authorize! :create, WidgetAssignment
    
        errors = []
        assignment_count = 0
    
        if params[:widget_ids]
          params[:widget_ids].each do |widget_id|
            widget_assignment_params = params[:widget_assignment].
                merge(widget_id: widget_id)
    
            @widget_assignment = WidgetAssignment.new(widget_assignment_params)
    
            if @widget_assignment.save
              assignment_count += 1
            else
              errors &lt;&lt; ""A widget assignment could not be created for #{widget_assignment.some_detail}""

I'm curious if this is a powerful enough machine to develop on (I also have a fast, 3.3 Ghz Ivy Bridge desktop, this laptop would be only a secondary machine when I want to get up from the desk). I would still be using it indoors. 

Naturally, I would be using a lightweight Linux distro. I use Sublime Text/Vim as my editor. 

I'm fairly new to Rails development and I can't really judge how resource intensive the development is. 
At first everything would run locally, with time I would move things to a VPS.

&gt; I want to test my model validations against random strings ^*paraphrasing

This seemed simple enough at first. Have an array of characters, choose a few from it, and bam, you have a test string. But as I thought about it more, I wanted to include all UTF-8 characters in the test. And then, even more, I want to test all input, not just valid characters.

I finally realized that this question is really about Fuzz testing rather than simple random strings. This led me to find [**FuzzBert**](https://github.com/emboss/FuzzBert).

&gt; FuzzBert defines an RSpec-like DSL that can be used to define different fuzzing scenarios

Using Fuzzbert along with your rspec tests, we can really give our validations a run for their money rather than just testing against the same ole static data.

Here's a bit more about the app and what we're looking to do....

The app is a SaaS based social media platform with a number of different functions, including email marketing. The specific email features we require via their api or Ruby Gem are 

1) Send transactional email as when a person signs up or a purchase is made

2) Bulk emails - ie send a newsletter

3) be able to define templates for emails

4) pull stats like open rates, delivery rates and clicks 

5) add or remove contacts via api

6) create list segmentation

7) While most of the above functionality will be done via the api via Ruby Gem, we will also be having the ability for our clients to log into the their email marketing provider account if they choose. So this means we'd need the ability to create parent / child accounts so that our fulfillment staff can use a parent (or master) account to administer and configure large numbers of client accounts easily form one place rather than having to log into each client account separately. This is needed because when we roll this out to large associations and organizations with many accounts on our platform we need to be able to easily create email templates that are then available to all the organisations accounts. (make sense?)

Anyway, the sticking point for many potential provides are NOT specifically the the first 6 items, as they are pretty standard now days, but rather #7 as well as there being a Ruby Gem already available for the provider.

I've looked at Amazon SES, Infusionsoft, Aweber, Constant Contact, Blue Hornet.

If anyone has any suggestions on who I should investigate I would be forever in your debt!

I'm creating a web application and I have the following situation involving mainly 3 different models:

- **User**: this is a very simple model. It stores authentication information: email and password
- **Employee**: details like Name FamilyName, Location, Birthdate, Gender, etc.
- **Employer**: details like Name, Website, Description, etc.

An Employee will have an association with Resume.  
An Employer will have an association with Opportunities.  

My problem is: both models will use the model User to authenticate.

So I thought:  
    User -&gt; has_one :employee
    User -&gt; has_one :employer

    Employee -&gt; belongs_to :user
    Employer -&gt; belongs_to :user

I will also have an mixed form that contains information from both models. Example:  

Form for Employee:  
* Email  
* Password  
* Name  
* FamilyName  
* Gender  
* Birthdate  

Form for Employer:  
* Email  
* Password  
* Name  
* Website  
* Description  


I'm using ""accepts_nested_attributes_for"" on the User model to accomplish that:  
    *accepts_nested_attributes_for :employee* 
    *accepts_nested_attributes_for :employer*  

So far so good. It works well, the forms work well too. But I don't think this is the best scenario. For example, I'm going to login and I will have an User object. How do I know if it's an Employee or Employer? I know I can add a attribute called UserType to the user Model and use 1 for Employee and 2 for Employer. It will do the trick but I don't like it.  
Is there a better approach for my situation?? Any help is very appreciated.

I am quite new to Rails, and am struggling to find a good solution to this problem. I want a User model (using devise if it matters), that a user can sign up using. This user can then choose what type of user they are: A or B, perhaps using an after signup hook, or they choose it during signup.. whatever. A and B have common functionalities, but are still quite different. Think.. student/teacher.

My issue is how I best structure that relationship. I've toyed with several ideas, but none have satisfied me 100%. My aim is to reduce repeated code, encapsulate commonality etc.

At the moment I am using a polymorphic approach where:

    A has_one User as C
    B has_one User as C

and 

    User belongs_to C, polymorphic =&gt; true

Any suggestions on alternatives?

Using Your Ruby Gem(s)

You will need to add /home5/memesene/ruby/gems to the include path. 
You can do this by adding the following code to your script:
$:.push(""/home5/memesene/ruby/gems"")

However, I'm not really sure what script they are referring to. In the documentation for memegen, there are instructions like:
To generate an image:

$ memegen a_dog ""Eat Crayons"" ""Poop Rainbows""

You only have to supply one piece of text:

However, I think I can provide a decent enough example of what I am trying to do.

Assuming the following basic model structures:

    account
    -------
    id
    
    user
    -------
    id
    account_id
    
    
    clients
    --------
    id
    user_id
    
    docs
    --------
    id
    client_id


Each account (business) can have multiple users that are able to sign in. Each user of that business has multiple clients.  Each of those clients has documents.

I can use 'has many through' on the user model to obtain a list of all documents beneath that tree.

However, how could I do the same at the account level? I want a list of all 'docs' that belong to all clients that belong to all users on that account. 

I can put something together to do it, but it feels terribly hacky and I didn't know if there was a better way.  I apologize if this question isn't phrased well enough. If you need any clarification then I can provide it.

For example, I could do:

    class Account &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
        def docs
            # let's say users have a has-many-through clients to docs.
            users.map(&amp;:docs)

Is this really the best course of action? If I did this, I wouldn't be able to append additional AREL to it.  What would be best would be: Account.docs.find(3)      or  Account.docs.where(:title =&gt; 'foo').

1306800147.0,6,self.rails,hntsd,Application inheritance?,malcontent,9,3,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/rails/comments/hntsd/application_inheritance/,"Rails or not is there a way to get something like application inheritance?

For example I have a base app. I build another app that uses the same database, controllers, views etc but changes the layout and some controllers but maybe connects to a different database or a different schema in the same database (or even the same database).

Maybe I have something that inherits that app and tweaks it a little.

Some options are.

Put everything in the same rails app, do some routing hacks for the domains, put every controller etc in a different namespace.

Write everything as gems/plugins/engines and put the gems inside your new app.

Anything else?

The idea here is to save deployment memory, and unclutter your app so it's easier to manage and test.
