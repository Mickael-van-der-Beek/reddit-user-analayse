1365033858.0,191,self.Columbus,1bmizn,"Since I'm leaving Columbus, here is my Food+Drink guide I've collected over the past two years",palsi,220,29,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1bmizn/since_im_leaving_columbus_here_is_my_fooddrink/,"
A quick background: I moved to Columbus in the spring of 2011 following my graduation from a small liberal arts college in the Los Angeles Area to work at The Ohio State. I was born and raised in North County San Diego, and have spent a lot of my youth and young adulthood traveling both the country and the world. Following my two years here, I'm heading back home to start medical school in the fall and decided to write down what I've learned/experienced as a pseudo-guide to those who are new to or are visiting Columbus.


I came to Columbus with an open mind and have loved almost every minute of being here. I consistently remind people who bitch and moan about Columbus that they are truly in an amazing town that is currently blooming and will continue to flourish in the near future. Here is my general guide and thoughts on Columbus. Understand that I am transportation challenged so most of this is in the Short North/Downtown area because it's where I live.


I'm going to start with what I am really quite passionate about: food and drink.


Food


Junior's Tacos - As a Southern Californian, I'm pretty picky when it comes to Mexican food, but Junior's tacos can get decently close. I've tried as much Mexican food I can get my hands on in Columbus and nothing has even come close except Juniors. It's not the same as a street taco stand in TJ on any level, but it can quench the crave at times. I like the al pastor tacos.


Mikey's Late Night Slice - no secret here. Everyone knows this place and for good reason as well. Awesome pizza with a twist of slut sauce. I would encourage you to try the weekly concoctions. My favorite is Spicy Ass with a small splattering of slut sauce.


Lac Viet - Pho. Just Pho. Pretty good pho too. He does a unique thing by making a lamb pho with beef broth and it's freaking delicious. Kind of out of my way, but he also has a food cart that he brings to campus area at times (mostly by the James). On a side note unrelated to the food, the guy who owns it is amazing and so incredibly kind. ""Forget your wallet at the office? No worries, you'll get me next time."" Get the lamb pho if available but if not you can settle for beef.


Da Levee - Cajun creole food with Justin's twist. He makes cajun/creole cooking super accessible to people who have never had it, as traditional cooking like this can be overpowering at times. I absolutely love Da Levee and it is a staple for me here in town. The menu always rotates but if you can get the Gumbalaya (gumbo dumped on top of Jambalaya) its awesome. Get ""dat bread"" and extra ""dat sauce"" on the side and you'll thank me (as long as you can deal with a little spice). Literally anything on the menu is good. 


Bono Pizza - One of Columbus' most hidden secrets in my opinion. This is a wood-fired pizza place in Grandview that is connected to a Gas Station. Not joking. Go, get a menage-a-trios for $25 and just enjoy the best pizza in Columbus. Maybe seats 10 inside so it's best to take it to go. Just unreal and could not recommend this place more. I enjoy the ""green giant"" pizza. Not quite sure if that's the exact name but you'll recognize it if you call in to order.


Commonwealth - Ok, I'm super biased. I am apparently their most loyal customer and have gotten to know everyone who works there pretty well, especially the owner. As objective as I can be, this place tops the list of good ""cheaper"" priced food in Columbus for me. Sandwiches done perfectly. Whenever I had someone visit me in town, this was the first meal we got, period. Go on Wednesday and get a $5 sandwich and you'll become a loyal member as well. Anything is good but my faves are The Lord Baltimore and the Bahn Fire.
I'm going to be revisiting Erik in some of the other places and I'll preface that I'm biased towards not only his food but to him as a person, so take this all with a grain of salt.


Basil Thai - Ok, not great Thai food to be honest. Not very good at all. But Monday-Thursday they have an insane lunch deal, something like 8 bucks for an appetizer, soup, and full size entree. For that deal it makes my list. Also, if you're a spice fiend, their ""spiciest you can make it"" isn't that spicy so go for it.


Bangkok Thai - now that I've given you mediocre Thai food, I have to give you good Thai food. Bangkok is like pseudo grocery store and definitely restaurant and is the best Thai food I've had in Columbus. I really encourage any of you to make the drive down to here and you will not be disappointed. I'm a Pad Thai guy.


Katalina's Corner Cafe - Awesome breakfast and pretty damn good lunch. There is a meal here for anyone and I've never had a bad meal. It is very small indoors but has a huge patio - so if the weather is bad you might have to wait awhile and it might not even be possible to sit down and get food unless you're really craving or are extremely patient. If the weather is nice, it's my go to place because of the awesome patio. Get the nutella swedish pancakes!


Angry Baker - Really cool place in Old Towne East that I've only been to twice but had rad experiences both times. A really good feel but incredibly small. Don't go anytime that you would consider ""peak"" because it only seats probably 10-15. The baked goods are awesome (at the Angry Baker??? Go figure!). 


Explorer's Club - Once again, only been here a few times (3-4?) but really awesome experiences. Food is Cuban kind of Latin influenced. I love this sort of food so it was right up my alley. I loved the plantains and the burrito I had for breakfast!


Tensuke Market - Just go. You've heard about it a ton of times and there's good reason to it. I like Tensuke (only been 3 times) and you're going to get exactly what you think are going to.


Tokyo GoGo - Food truck parked at Brother's Drake - GO. So very good. So very very good. Forgive my spelling, but I had the karogge, karakke, and Gyoza dumplings. The dumplings are my favorite but the karogge is so incredibly close. Fantastic Japanese street food and I absolutely love it. I only wish it was there for much longer before I left.


Skillet - German Village - Just a phenomenal breakfast spot. I haven't been there for anything but breakfast (do they even do other meals?), but every time has resulted in a fantastic experience. It is tiny inside, and therefore it results in long waits, but to me it is well worth the wait. I constantly hear that they have the best Cinnamon roll in the world, but, alas, every time I go it is sold out. I guess that speaks to the quality of it.


Northstar - This place is insanely popular for a reason, it is insanely good. The turkey hash breakfast thing has to be my favorite breakfast meal anywhere. IMO that's a huge compliment coming from a kid who was raised on the best breakfast burrito's you can find. Breakfast is where they excel, but I also like the chicken sandwich thing for lunch and the square meal for dinner (add chicken to that and douse it with their house-made hot sauce, but it will still be a square meal). 


Harvest Pizza - German Village - Damn good wood-fired pizza. More of a sit-down restaurant. Relatively small. Might be a little overpriced for dinner, but it's worth it in my mind. The real secret here is that their lunch deal is pretty incredible. The Ohio Double-Bacon is my favorite. * Plus it's connected to Curio. Awesome date-spot if you're willing to drop ~$50-$60 on a drink and dinner. Go to Curio, get a cocktail while you wait for your table at Harvest Pizza.


Pistacia Vera - German Village - The macaroons are good, but sadly they overshadow the rest of the baked goods. I love the almond croissant! The egg dishes are phenomenal as well. Getting breakfast here then meandering over to the German Village Bookstore is one of my favorite morning adventures!


Jeni's Ice Cream - No Brainer. Just go. Best ice cream in America. Brown butter almond brittle will blow your mind.


I've been to a ton (read: 90%) of the fine dining in Columbus, so I can go more in-depth in that area if you guys want but I just want to highlight one fantastic restaurant IMO:


Basi - Hidden in an Alley in Victorian Village - Real freaking good Italian food. Hand's down my favorite fine dining in Columbus. The zucchini pronto is one of my favorite dishes of all time (and it's so freaking easy, I cannot replicate it for the life of me though). I have nothing bad to say about this place at all besides the fact that it is very tiny, gets booked quickly, and is pricey.

I was walking with a friend and we were only 100 feet from his home when two men attacked us. We ran away as fast as we could, got to his place, and called the police. There have been a lot of stories about awful police encounters, but mine could not have been better.

I called the police less than a minute after the attack. Less than four minutes later an officer arrived at my friend's house. In less than five minutes after that the officer sprinted out the door to help other police officials apprehend the muggers. In that small amount of time we had a K9 unit, helicopter, and three different precincts reporting on the scene.

The response was amazing, the alleged attackers were caught, and I feel safe knowing that this city is employing an intelligent, professional police force that was even able to inject a bit of levity into the situation when need be. Thanks CPD. You have a huge fan here.

If you happen to know any one who lives/was in the general area it would be wonderful if you could spread the word about this crime. Brian Vura was one of the nicest people we knew, any detail could be useful to the investigation. Thank you for your time.

The Ohio State Highway Patrol have at least 2 new silver Dodge Darts out on the roads here in Columbus. They seem to blend in very well with the road especially in the wintertime.

We've all been use to the typical Crown Vics out there. The newer model Malibu and Charger cruisers out there still stick out but with the Dart it takes me a few extra seconds.

Not that I *ever* speed of course so I'm not concerned.

Just thought I'd pass this along in a /r/columbusmildlyinteresting manner.

Here’s how the H.B. 194 will hurt Ohioans by reducing their access to voting:
 
-Reduce by mail absentee voting to 3 weeks from 5 weeks and reduce in person absentee voting to 2 weeks.
-Ban in person absentee voting on Sundays and Saturday after noon hour
-Ban in person early voting during the last weekend before the election
-Make it more difficult for the Election Boards to open extra offices in the community to make it more convenient to vote early
-Stop local Election Boards from sending absentee ballot applications unsolicited to all voters
-Stop local Elections Boards from paying postage on return absentee ballot requests or on the return of absentee ballots
 
-H.B. 194 will increase the amount of people voting in person on Election Day, bringing back long lines and the potential for multiple hour waits for Ohioans to exercise their Constitutional rights to vote.
 
PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION TOMORROW at one of the above locations and BRING A FRIEND!!!

Her speech from the bench prompted at least one juror to burst into tears and another requested an escort home, fearing for her safety after the response from the judge and menacing looks from friends and family of the prosecuting witness. Additionally, the judge had invited other jurors from the jury pool to sit in the courtroom to witness the verdict. After witnessing her tirade the remaining jurors had to be dismissed, causing other trials to be delayed. This is not the first incident of misconduct I have witnessed or heard of in her courtroom but it is by far the worst. Her conduct not only demeans the dignity of the court but undermines the very idea of trial by jury. If you have witnessed any incident in her courtroom please report it to the Ohio Supreme Court at http://www.supremecourt.ohio.gov/DisciplinarySys/odc/complaint.asp . I don't know where to start to get this before the media, but at the very least I know that todays incident is being reported to the bar and will be investigated. It may take time, but the system works, eventually. 

Edit - I've been told that ABC 6 ran a story on the incident tonight! If someone has a link to the story on their website PM it to me and I'll add it to the story. Thanks for all of the kind words Reddit.

As there were people behind me, I rushed at the ATM and left my card in it. I realized last night what had happened so this morning I drove to Kroger before work to see if anyone had turned it in. Nope. I drive to work to check my balance. Additional money was missing. How could they possibly have gotten my PIN?

Long day at work (our primary mail server crashed) is coming to a close when I get back to the office and our accountant tells me my bank manager called and said someone returned my ATM card AND my money!! Simply incredible. Thanks so much stranger! You did an awesome thing.

And the cost is $20 for quarter, which is $5 per month. 

Link to a recreation center in your neighborhood:
http://parks.columbus.gov/communitycenters.aspx


You will need a Leisure Card, and it is $2, but you don't have to renew the $2, and it allows you to go to the public pools for free all summer.

Leisure Card info:
http://parks.columbus.gov/leisurecards.aspx

Not only do they have a gym, but each rec center has a variety of great group classes that are extremely affordable and a great way to learn new things, meet new people, or a neat first date. 

I grew up 2 blocks away from Thompson and utilized their services, leagues, and resources while I was young and couldn't have been happier. It's a great way to connect with your community and a great resource for young families who need affordable activities.

You have one person on the street corner underneath a prop shower head and curtains talking or singing to themselves .  They would just act as if they were just in a shower alone, but then act a part when they have the attention of stopped traffic.  I need at least two good actor willing to be in public with just a towel on.  Two people would be holding up a shower curtain prop with water getting dumped on the person speaking from time to time.  

Five people will hold signs.  The signs each would read as this:

&gt;I don't break the law

&gt;I don't have anything to hide

&gt;Why do I care if the NSA listens?

&gt;Privacy is why

&gt;Protect The Fourth!

So you drive up to the stop light.  You read those signs one by one.  As you pull up to the corner, you see this person singing to himself in the shower.  

That is my vision, and I need 7 people to help me with it.  I want to meet up Wednesday at a park to practice and discuss details with everyone if we can get this organized.  PM me if you are interested in participated.

Upvote this for visibility.  If you are interested, please share this.  I don't want to hold a protest with 1,000 people on a street corner.  We can do that later.  Please PM though if you are interested because 7 people is just the bare minimum of what I need.  Thanks!

Thank you too /u/corvuskorax for pointing out that I can make it cheap with pvc that includes a stand.  I need to think about all of your responses for a minute, then I will get back with you.

Luckily my mom was in the area and I was able to call her - but those kind gestures from strangers definitely helped me feel less bewildered and stressed out.  As I waited, I started feeling really faint, and the bright sun wasn't helping. These two construction workers let me sit in the shade in this garage area and brought me some ice water to drink. They chatted with me comfortably until my mom arrived.

I just want to send out my thanks to everyone who asked if I was alright and everyone who offered to assist me. And I want to express my appreciation for *all* the Columbus residents who make it a habit to be a good neighbor and citizen, to help others, to do what they can to make our city a better place - from volunteering at the food pantry to giving directions to smiling at people on the bus.

There's nearly 5k of us, maybe we can show them some Reddit love. 

So, once a week, we select a random locally owned business. Restaurant, store, probably not a bar, since there's already meet-ups and whatnot. During that week, we all attempt to visit, shop, eat, etc. at this business. Ideally it's a place where you've been, and you love it, but it's always slow.

I've kind of shut off my mind to anything else. I recently have started to become bored by what is known and extremely interested in less definite parts of life. Here's the thing though, all I've ever known is Math and Science. **So here's my question:**

**Would anyone on here be interested in simply meeting for coffee (on me of course!) and just telling me what you're passionate about? I think it would be really cool to have coffee with a whole bunch of people who think differently just so that I can get a greater understanding of people's outlook on life.**

After coffee, I would write a couple pages on your particle passions and aspirations in life and save it for personal reference. Once I get enough of them though, I might put them online (with identities hidden if requested) so other's can read them and perhaps open their minds to ways of life that they've never experienced. I think there is a lot to learn from each other. 

PM me if you're interested. Maybe you could learn something from me as well. 

**tl;dr:** I want to know what you're passionate about. I'll buy you coffee if you sit with me and talk about things no one else cares enough to listen to.



**EDIT:** I wanted to add an edit to clarify a few things:

1) As Jeff_E_Popp suggested, I want to let you know that I don't plan on chopping anyone up into little pieces. To ensure this doesn't happen, I'm suggesting that we meet in a public place of your choice. That way I get to experience a little more of Columbus too!

2) This is all about you. I know that some people have so much they want to say, but know one cares. I care. If you get bored talking about yourself and want to hear what I have to say, ask. I'll gladly share. 

3) I am getting a lot of people who are interested so I am making a spreadsheet so I will not forget about anyone. If you said you are interested, I WILL meet up with you at some point this summer. I apologize if it's not for a couple of weeks. 

4) A little more about me: I'm an OSU Engineering Student and will be working in Columbus this summer in an internship. I'm just legitimately curious about different people's perspectives on life so that I can open my mind a little more to differences among all of us. 

Thank you for your interest! This will be an exciting project! 


**EDIT 2:** This is easily the best idea that I've ever had. I look forward to meeting all of you!


**EDIT 3:** I currently have about 35 people who have expressed interest. If it works out that I can meet with all of them, one person per day, that is 5 weeks of meetings. That is extremely exciting for me! But, it means that it could be a while before I actually meet with you. Be patient because if you are legitimately interested in doing this, I will find the time to meet with you. It just might be 5-6 weeks from now... 

I should also note that I will only be here for 14 more weeks before moving to Findlay, OH. Because of this, I would not like to book more than 70 people tops. I'll let you know when/if I get to that number. Thanks again for volunteering guys!


**UPDATE: ** I just realized that there are a lot of people on here that said they were interested that I haven't set up a date with yet. If you still are interested or need some assurance, here is what the project is turning into: http://thePerspectiveMovement.com. Check it out and email me if you are interested.

We are planning to start a brewery,redbenn,55,9,33,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/qkkmr/hey_rcolumbus_we_are_planning_to_start_a_brewery/,"Some of you may have read about us on [Columbus Underground](http://www.columbusunderground.com/oval-brewing-company-looking-to-kickstart-new-beer-business) or [Drink Up Columbus](http://drinkupcolumbus.com/2012/02/01/giving-the-oval-brewing-company-a-kickstart/). I am Adam from the [Oval Brewing Company](http://ovalbrewing.com). We are planning a new brewery in Columbus. It will be a production brewery with a tasting room attached (cans &amp; kegs). We are looking at a couple locations in the Short North / Brewery District. While it won't be a full brew pub from the start, our plan is to make it a place where people can come and hang out and drink some good beer. 
Along with raising funds the traditional way, we started a [Kickstarter campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ovalbrewing/the-oval-brewing-company-the-best-damn-beer-in-the). 

The campaign is going great so far, we are a little over halfway through and over 2/3 of the way to our goal. We thought Redditors may want to help, so we came up with a special Reddit Kickstarter reward. 

http://vimeo.com/37571657

[This page](http://ovalbrewing.com/kickstarter-reddit-rewards/) goes into more detail, with an explainer video.

One of the cool things about Kickstarter is it can track where backers originate from… and we thought it would be a great idea to keep track of and thank Reddit backers in a special way. If the total pledges originating from Reddit are $10,000 or over, we will brew and can a beer created by Reddit! You will still get the awesome rewards as non-redditor backers, but you will get the opportunity to help crowd-source one of our first beers. You will get to vote on the label design, style, strength, and name! And regardless of your pledge level, your Reddit username will be displayed on the can*!

1313454803.0,47,self.Columbus,jjxj7,I propose we make a wiki guide to Columbus.,hbweb500,47,0,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/jjxj7/i_propose_we_make_a_wiki_guide_to_columbus/,"Yes, I know we already have one over there -----&gt;
but I think we can do better!

Several years ago I spent a summer in the small college town of Davis, California. Now, Davis is a cool little town: the main mode of transportation is by bicycle, there are [tunnels built for toads](http://daviswiki.org/Toad_Tunnel) to use, and it has a bunch of [Hobbit-themed streets](http://daviswiki.org/The_Hobbit). This is all wonderful and made Davis a really fun place, but I never would have known these things if it weren't for the awesome [Davis Wiki](http://daviswiki.org/Front_Page).

Columbus is a great town, and it's quite a bit more vibrant than a lot of people realize. Unfortunately, when I came back from California, I realized we didn't have anything like the Davis wiki here. 

Here's the two main reasons I think a Columbus wiki would be great:

* Look at /r/Columbus and you'll see quite a few threads asking about local shops and culture: Who is a good mechanic in the city? Where can I go to find a one-night stand? A wiki would be awesome for these questions, as people could contribute their own reviews and articles about coffee shops, restaurants, and so forth.

* It would be a great place to highlight the charm of Columbus. One of my favorite things about Davis were all of the weird things around town, most of which were documented on the wiki. It made the town really exciting. Columbus isn't nearly as weird, but we still have some hidden treasures. Who hasn't read about OSU's [underground tunnels](http://www.infiltration.org/underosu/tunnels.html), for example? They aren't exactly gems, but it's cool to read about things that you might pass every day but don't think about.


**But we already have the ""Reddit Guide to Columbus""**
Yes, and it is a great first step. However, it doesn't provide much more than simple links to places. A wiki could provide discussion. More importantly, however, the Reddit Guide is only really known by redditors, whereas a wiki might be able to help a wider audience.

**So why are you posting this?**
I'd love to build a Columbus wiki myself; I think it would be a great way to give back to the city and campus area. But I'm a grad student with limited time, I know little about getting a website ranked and available to the point that it would actually be used by people, and perhaps most importantly, I'm not hugely knowledgeable about Columbus. Of course anybody can write for a wiki, I guess I'm looking for some serious people who would be interested in running one.

**So, tldr:** I'm looking for a couple Columbus redditors who'd be interested in helping establish something like a wiki guide to Columbus, more thorough than our subreddit's guide, and hopefully useful to people, both redditors and the normal kind alike.

~~EDIT: oops, title should have said ""flying""...~~

~~I'm a local pilot getting hours for my CFII, and are looking for people who might want to go along!~~

~~I can take up to 3 people, but you all have to be lightweights if we fly that many. 2 other people is not as big of a deal weight wise. I can't give you the solid figures because there is also a problem with balancing the aircraft, so it is easier for you to give me the weights of people going, and I can see if I can make it work.~~

~~The aircraft is a Mooney M20J. On average, I cruise at about 130 mph, but it can peak at about 170.~~

~~All I ask is that we split some of the fuel costs. It runs about 80 dollars an hour, and we divide it among us. Can't beat flying at 27 an hour when divided among three of us!~~

~~This is a dual control aircraft (imagine a car with two steering wheels). I don't mind showing you a bit about how a plane flies too, and let you control it :). Remember, only I will do the landings and takeoffs though.~~

~~NOTE: Because of regulations, this can only be a recreational flight, meaning I can't give you a ride without bringing you back to the same airport by the end of the tip. Places in between can be visited though! We have to return to the original airport when it is done. Also importantly, no business trips!~~

~~I run out of the OSU airport. You can see my FB profile (where I post my adventures) at [Facebook.com/Anticept](Http://www.facebook.com/anticept)~~


~~Here is a picture of my little girl :) [Mooney M20J](http://www.airport-data.com/images/aircraft/small/427/427796.jpg). I haven't a full picture of my own yet that is as good as this, so sorry about linking to airport-data.com~~

~~I pretty much go flying at the drop of a hat. Here is my schedule:~~

~~https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=3mmpte8jbcsg63hkd1uie49k0k%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York~~

~~**EDIT:** whoa a lot of interest in my inbox. Coolness! If you are interested, you guys have to come up with a day and time (could even be the same day if I catch it in time) because that is easier for me to coordinate.~~

~~**EDIT 2 8/29 12:00pm:** I've put some more information in this post, and created a calendar showing my availability. This will be much easier to manage this way. In fact, I'm also working on a subreddit and getting it ready for launch, I have a feeling that with this much interest, we could have quite a successful thing going for many pilots to use!~~

Want to capture the imagination of your students before the summer break?,Anticept,56,13,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1e1sxn/hey_columbus_educators_want_to_capture_the/,"I've made a few posts here and there on reddit about my flying activities, and I want to step up my game. Teaching people about flying is my life; it is the purpose that I have made mine.

So here's the deal. I think aviation is too distant from people. Fences around the airports, tight security, and very little access to passerby's have killed interest in the hobby. (Along with the absurd costs). So I'd like to do something off the wall. I want flying to be on people's minds again.

**I want to bring my plane to your school yard.**

N566FD: Http://imgur.com/a/e3FHU

I have the trailer needed to being it to your school, and it's easily done by my crew. The wings taken off and set on the ground on the left in this picture: Http://i.imgur.com/0pOCsuE.jpg

I can adjust the lesson plan to fit as much or as little time as i am allotted, covering a range of topics, and even extend lesson plans to more specifically fit the classes being taught (example: teaching physics? A large focus will be on aerodynamics and fluid dynamics!)

Example topics that can be covered:

- Explanation of aerodynamics
- Air traffic control operations
- Aviation safety
- Aviation engineering and maintenance
- Navigation and geography
- Airport operations
- Aviation career opportunities
- Flight training operations

Simply put, I want to be an inspiration to people. Be it elementary or college students, I want to touch people's lives.

*Limitations:*

While the airplane will be on display and people can walk up, touch, and sit in it, there are a few things that I cannot do for safety's sake, and to protect the aircraft from damage (as I am taking sole responsibility):

- As much fun as the thought is, no flying. There's likely no school yards large enough for the rollout, and it's just asking for trouble. It's also illegal :)
- NO ONE will be allowed near the aircraft unsupervised. This is a live working aircraft with the potential to do serious harm. It will be shut down, fuel drained, engine spark plugs removed, and starter disconnected. We will be able to run the avionics though!
- It will be my crew's discretion where we take it and who may touch and climb in. I doubt we will refuse anyone, barring time limitations, but I'm solely shouldering the risk involved to a VERY expensive airplane, so I reserve this right.
- If allowed, a demonstration with the engine running and taxiing around a bit can be done, with proper precautions taken, at the end of the day as part of an aviation maintenance lesson.
- Cannot be done on fridays. We have to assemble and test the aircraft to return it to airworthyness, and our shop doesn't operate on the weekend.

To arrange: PM or reply in comments. I'm incredibly busy so I often cannot immediately answer my phone, but here it is: 614-668-niner-four-four-niner. If you choose to call, respectfully, please don't waste my time, only call if you are serious about arranging something. :)

EDIT: here's a size comparison to the other airplane we have; same model same year.

Many of you are fans and supporters of Community Festival (ComFest), especially since GRMD usually fell during ComFest weekend.  If you have never been, it's a great (albeit slightly weird) free festival at Goodale Park that has been around since 1972.  ComFest features local food, drink, art, music, and performances and the money raised through purchases is used throughout the year to fund grants to local community organizations.  At first glance it may seem like another hippie art festival, but deeper down ComFest provides a ton of support to the local community.  The past few years they have even taken action supporting workers' rights by organization action against SB5.  

Anyway, I just wanted to open a discussion thread.  I'll be volunteering at the jazz liquor bar Friday night after 7 so come say hi! 

Speaking of Volunteering.... 

ComFest still needs more volunteers, especially for the safety, recycle, and trash pickup jobs.  You can sign up here.  You'll get some drink tokens and a T-shirt for volunteering. 
http://www.comfest.com/volunteer/

Now here is my shameless plug:
My friends and I have hosted an annual electronic dance after-party on the Saturday of ComFest at Skully's Music Diner.  We've done this the past few years and it is always an amazing time. Skully's also has drink specials with your ComFest mug.  This year will be headlined by the local dark techno group roeVy and one of Columbus' most promising producers, Druid Cloak (who releases many songs named after WoW spells haha).  I'll be DJing at 11 PM too!

Here are some links if you want more information.  Can't wait for this weekend!

Here's some background: As many of us know (at least a lot of the college student in the area) there was a block party on Chittenden Avenue Saturday. There were cops that were lining the streets before five o'clock while many people were plainly just having a good time within their property, off of the streets and sidewalks. Eleven o'clock rolled around and crowds increased, yet they stayed incredibly controlled for the amount of people present. 

The deal: a little before one o'clock, without warning, the crowd of people was maced. There was no warning, and if there was it was not audible and apparently they didn't find it important enough to make it heard. This is beyond unacceptable. Why are we allowing these police to fill the streets with police horses and what seems like the entire fleet of cruisers? What danger was posed this night? None is your answer. We did nothing and if there was someone breaking the law, arrest them! take care of the people that are actually committing crimes, not the bystanders. We do not live in a police state and this is not okay. Alright, so you say ""They were trying to prevent a riot."" I really disagree with this method of protection for a peaceful crowd but there's more to this story.

A large group of police officers were standing in the gateway area on 10th and high among the masses of people. I watched one of these officers walk towards a group of people just standing around. He pulled out his canister and sprayed them. What were they doing, you ask? They were not yelling. They were not even close to being rowdy. Simply standing in an area and they got pepper sprayed for it. **why is this okay, Columbus?** why do we let this happen? we should be *disgusted* that our residents are being treated like this. The police are here to **serve and protect** not to reprimand us like children when they choose too. I don't know about you but I'm moving out of this city. This is just a gross display of power abuse. I'll be writing Coleman too but I wanted to fill people in on some of the stuff that is going on out there before the police force the media to tell they're story and not the real one.",,False,self,t5_2r373,False,,,True,t3_tvzha,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/tvzha/columbus_we_should_be_disgusted/,

Hopefully makes news,freederp,64,23,27,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/vh4n5/after_comfest_cop_fiasco_hopefully_makes_news/,"At about 1:30 am saturday morning, hours after Comfest has ended this happened. This all happened on E17th ave and Summit. Seen from my front porch, a cop car speeding down Summit, responding to a call (somewhere on E 18th some cops were making a bust or something) goes out of control, runs into student housing, waking up the entire building. My friends and I went to investigate and give our side of the story from what we saw. I talked to the residents who said the their apartment didn't have a basement because the foundation was destroyed. You could see through the building. The cruisers air bag was deployed and hood wrecked. 

About 30 minutes later, my friends and I went back to my porch only to witness a vehicle going northbound (the wrong way) on Summit. Two cruisers turned on their sirens and lights then pursue the car. Only to be cut off by a car turning left off of E17th at a green light, causing the two cruisers to crashing into each other in a mild fender-bender. 

Tipped off the news. Hopefully this will get some news coverage. I can't stop laughing about what I have witnessed.

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our Kickstarter Campaign &amp; Video](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500'ish words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, 2012 we’ll hit the road from Portland, OR bound for Portland, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our van (1997 Ford Aerostar) will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. We plan on being in the Columbus area (and Ohio in general) in September but we'd love to find a few willing participants now. 

Throughout our journey, we’ll blend old-fashioned and contemporary connection as we seek out strangers in a variety of ways: from just asking a random person, to bulletin boards, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, CouchSurfing, pure chance, and more. We’ll build community and engage local media outlets along the way.

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, learning what our new friends think about life’s big and little questions. We’ll chronicle these conversations in our blog so that strangers can meet strangers—virtually. Our project will foster connection, conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions, but our hope is that the conversation will continue long after the breakfast dishes are cleared. How? We’ll start here and see where it ripples out:

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book, Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America. We will donate 10 percent of the book’s proceeds to Servas US, a non-profit organization promoting peace through travel and relationship-building.

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration,

**Matt &amp; Courtney**

If you are planning to vote Democrat this year (or if you are planning to vote Republican and live in a county that normally leans Democrat), it is important that you know that voting hours will be between 8am and 5pm IN COUNTIES THAT NORMALLY VOTE DEMOCRAT (Republican counties will have extended voting hours). These are the exact same hours that most people will be working. Remember, Ohio employers MUST LEGALLY PROVIDE THEIR EMPLOYEES TIME OFF TO VOTE IN STATE AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS. So if you normally work 8-5 (or 9-5) make sure that you let your employer know ahead of time that you will be taking time off to vote on election day.

Also does anyone else have it? We should be... friends. Or in circles or whatever their deal is.

**NOTE:** Thanks for the positive feeback. Also **the invites are, as far I as I can tell, unlimited.** So you do not need to ask me if I have invites -- all I have to do is share a post with you and you should get an invite. **It is also worth noting that they may be delayed -- it took a day or so for me to get one,** and so far I have not gotten any responses. Google is slowly letting more people in so check your inboxes. **It will be there when Google says it will be there.**
 

**Edit:** Either I or LonghornFeghorn have got everyone up until now (9pm 7/4/11). I will check back later. If you are concerned for email privacy, please PM me, otherwise posting here may allow it to be done faster as someone else could get to it.

**Edit:** Another batch at 10:08

I'll check back later. In the midst of a Lord Of The Rings-athon with the new extended edition blu-rays.

**Edit:** Another batch at 12:45. Possibly my last one of the night. It appears that these are not instant, but if you don't get it in a day or two post it here, or send me a pm (with your email address) so that I can re-invite you.

This stray has been hanging around our complex on North 4th just south of Hudson. He's skinny and pretty dirty, but so sweet and friendly. It's obvious he was a house cat at some point. 

I know the odds are he was just abandoned, but if anyone is looking for him, let me know. He's a total lovebug and just wants to be held and petted. We're giving him food and water but unfortunately can't take him in, even though I would love to.

I am an unintentional recluse, who is having a very difficult time finding friends who like to play board/tabletop/rpg/larp games. I'm looking for a good, dedicated, accepting group of people to get together with. 

I work at home as a commodities broker, and as such, have no co-workers. I don't drink, so hanging out in bars gets old for me very quick. I like to play Xbox/PC games, and play chess with my wife when she will humor me, but I'd really like to get into some of the excellent board games out there without having to talk someone into begrudgingly going through the motions. 

If anyone has a group with room for an outgoing, talkative, educated, incredibly geeky 35 year old guy, I'd like to join you for a game or ten. Thanks Columbus, sorry if this is the wrong place to post.

**Edit**: Thanks so much guys and (presumably?) gals, I will be contacting several of you to meet up and play. The CABS option looks enticing, as well as a few of your smaller groups.

Who: Calgary Flames at Columbus Blue Jackets  
What: Hockey Game  
When: Tonight at 7pm  
Where: Nationwide Arena (200 W Nationwide Blvd, Columbus OH)  
Why: Because the Blue Jackets are red hot, having gone 11 straight games without losing in regulation, posting a 7-0-4 record. The Jackets are just outside of a playoff position and with 6 home games left this season you might not want to miss this one!

**About the Calgary Flames**  
The Flames (11-13-4) are currently 14th (out of 15) in the Western Conference. They are 4-6-0 in their last 10 games. They're a team that likes to shoot the puck a lot so they're going to test Columbus' defense and goaltending which can be highly entertaining if Bobrobsky is on his game again tonight.

**About the Columbus Blue Jackets**  
Your Columbus Blue Jackets have a 12-12-6 record which may be only the second time in team history they've been ""0.500"" this late into a season. They are red hot right now, having won 7 of the last 11 games with their 4 'losses' coming in overtime or the shootout. The 11 game point streak (you get a point for not losing in regulation) is the longest in franchise history. They look to extend that to 12 games tonight. A win would tie the Jackets with the San Jose Sharks for the 8th seed in the Western Conference. Goaltender Sergei ""Number One Cop on the Force"" Bobrovsky has been playing out of his mind lately and is the largest contributing factor to the team's success. It's worth the price of admission alone to see this guy play.

**How do I get tickets this late**  
Well, you've got 5 options:

1. You can pay full price at the box office.
2. You can buy second hand [from StubHub](http://www.stubhub.com/columbus-blue-jackets-tickets/columbus-blue-jackets-columbus-nationwide-arena-22-3-2013-4222860/)
3. You can get a ""[Tim Horton's Jacket's Pack](http://www.ticketmaster.com/event/05004A2C7EA22166?artistid=805927&amp;majorcatid=10004&amp;minorcatid=9&amp;tm_link=venueartist_msg-1_05004A2C7EA22166)"" for $37ish per person which includes: ""a ticket, $10 food &amp; beverage voucher, Blue Jackets hat, a Tim Hortons travel mug with voucher redeemable for a free coffee fill-up, and a 10-pack of Timbits starting at $30 per person. ""
4. If you're an Ohio high school or college student you can get upper bowl tickets for $15 or lower bowl for $25 through the [CBJ Student Rush](http://bluejackets.nhl.com/club/page.htm?id=47887) program.
5. Show up at the box office at or around 5pm today for Huntington ""Green seats"": A minimum of 250 tickets are available for just $10 at the Big Lots Box Office at Nationwide Arena two hours prior to every home game.

**But what about the OSU basketball game?**  
I checked with the director of game operations and he informed me that the OSU game will be on many of the TVs in the concourse and the PA announcer will be giving updates throughout the hockey game. Additionally, there's a bar inside Nationwide Arena (the LaBatt Blue Light Lounge) that has tons of TVs that will be showing both the OSU &amp; CBJ game.",,False,self,t5_2r373,1363973242.0,,,True,t3_1at5f5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1at5f5/looking_for_something_to_do_tonight_come_check/,

I've had them both from the time they were pups. They are both housebroken indoor dogs. However, working dogs being what they are, they do require daily walks or other exercise. They are crate trained, but need to be out of the crate whenever their human companions are home. They get along with children and other dogs, and generally don't try to eat the cats.

These dogs are like family to me, and I care very much about how they will be treated in their next forever home.  The right owner will understand how to confine escape artists - for example, fenced-in yards generally require the fence to be buried about a foot below the ground, and provisions must be made to keep them inside if it's too hot out. Also of note, these aren't dogs that go fetch – they'll look at the stick with a funny expression, then run at high speed into the woods.

I had fully intended to be the one “forever home” to Dakota and Nakita, but my life's plans were derailed two years ago by the death of my wife. I am getting ready to relocate and simply don't have the time that these girls need. The adoption fee of $160 for both is non-negotiable.  I will split them as a last resort, but strong preference will be given to someone who can take them as a pair.

They come with a 5'x5' cage.  The cage comes in panels (some assembly required) and has a ceiling.

The Giant Eagle at Olentangy and High is open with power, as is the CVS at Lane and High. No gas stations between Oakland and roughly Dodridge on High are open last I saw. North Campus Food Mart is closed. Anyone know what's going on north of the Giant Eagle? Is there still debris on North Broadway?

**Edit 4:30 pm 6/30** Rio at Lane &amp; High is closed, as are Taj Bar and Faye's Beer and Wine a bit further north. Cazuela's at High and Patterson is open but cash-only and limited menu options.

Short North allegedly has power, but does anyone have more info? **edit**: North Market and convention center downtown confirmed to have power.

**EDIT:** Also, discussion of where to get dry ice is unfolding [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/vu7uo/places_to_buy_dry_ice/)

OSU campus has power; the main library, student union and SEL should all be open but this is unconfirmed. Hitchcock Hall is open if you use the Engineering Career Services entrance (across from Knowlton Hall.

McDonald's at High and 18th is open.

WEST SIDE: Friend is reporting that everything around Wilson Avenue, Trabue Road at the golf course, and Rome-Hilliard Road is normal and open. The Wal-Mart, Target, and Meijer on Rome-Hilliard are all open. Kinnear Road at Kenny is reportedly still closed.

NORTHEAST SIDE: Repair crews are out on parts of Hamilton Road as of 3:15 PM.

OLD NORTH/SOHUD: Rumba Cafe on Summit is open w/ power.

INDEPENDENCE VILLAGE: Kroger's at Gender and Refugee reportedly has power.

CHURCHES: Vineyard Columbus is reportedly without power. If anyone has information on churches that are opening their doors with food, A/C, etc. please include that as well.

Columbus Crew game for tonight has not been canceled, though the stadium's phone lines are out, according to [a post](http://www.thecrew.com/news/2012/06/crew-stadium-phones-out) on their website.

POLARIS: Reports of traffic lights out, but no word on specific businesses yet - apparently only half of Polaris is without power. (**EDIT:** TGIFriday's is reportedly open.)

**ALSO CHECK**:
[This thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/vtcwt/weather_update/), though the info might be a bit outdated by now.

[This map](https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=207639053002416836686.0004c3aeb44ed16911e15&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=40.135853,-83.014771&amp;spn=0.002461,0.006539) of open stores does not contain much information for campus/downtown, but may be useful, especially for folks looking for open grocery stores.

Also see list of cooling centers [here.](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/06/30/without-power-heres-where-to-turn.html)
10Tv seems to have a pretty up-to-date list of street closures [here.](http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2012/06/30/columbus-storm-road-closures.html)

**UPDATES 7/1**: Rio at Lane &amp; High apparently reopened for a bit last night (6/30), and Ace of Cups further north on High was open for at least a little while last night. ACE Hardware at Hudson and High was closed when I went by at about 5:30 last night, but no signage indicated it was directly due to lack of power.

Traveling south on 315 from Lane to 71 South last night resulted in no problems for me, although there was a lane closed at roughly exit 36 on 71 South (which is like an hour away from Cbus anyway.)

Polaris reportedly just got more power back (including at Mellow Mushroom) but it is unclear whether or not the whole mall has power back now or just most of it. Crew Stadium has power back (last night's game was delayed by an hour) so any future events should proceed as planned.

if it is yours contact me @ 4403202297 my name is josh

[EDIT] this dog seems to have a bit of a history on craigslist of being found around this area. i posted him on franklincountyauditor.com and petfbi.org. based on his history, im not sure anyone is looking for him. so i have made the decision to make his status: free to a good home. cmon reddit, i dont want him to have to stay in a shelter forever.

**UPDATE**
Charlie (the only name he responds to through about 4 hours of giving him a different name every-time i need his attention) will be leaving my care today, and will be taken in by the Franklin County Animal Shelter on Alum Creek Dr. PLEASE, if anyone see's this and its your pet, that is where he will be. Also if anyone wants a great, loving, house-trained, playful dog, PLEASE go adopt him. he needs a good owner more than ANYTHING. to P-Rickles, im sure the animal shelter could tell you if he has shots or not, im bring him into the shelter soon, so if you would like to call them, their number is (614) 525-4361, also i will try my best to get as much information as possible when i drop him off, and i will let you know what i find out. THANK YOU EVERYONE for showing this dog as much support as you did, and showing basically anyone who visits r/columbus this dog. i will leave you with two final pictures of his last day in my care. 

Thanks Again!

**UPDATE**
me and some friends were skating on 4th a little ways past Hudson and saw a flyer for Charlie! i called the owner, and he seemed very happy to hear this news. what a great ending to this story, the animal shelter closed before he could get there, but charlie only has to spend one night in the slammer then gets to be re-united with his rightful owner! Sparty_52 said it all, thank you so much r/Columbus for helping this dog find his home. i will leave you with a photo of the flyer, and hopefully charlie is home safe by tomorrow evening. thanks again everyone. you truly have changed this dogs life.

Was told to post here.,massive_cock,39,7,36,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/12b2yz/stranded_in_airport_for_up_to_34_days_no_money_or/,"Title says it. I was supposed to fly to Portland Oregon at 6:30 tonight. I get to ticketing and I'm told my ticket has been canceled by the booking agency (a travel website) and the agency tells me it was an automated cancellation. They tell me to buy another ticket and wait for them to refund the first, which takes 7-14 days. I don't have the money for another ticket. So I guess the new house/job/etc in Portland is lost. But now I can't even get back home. I was driven out here by my younger brother and dropped off, and it's 2+ hours driving to get home. No one can come get me before Thursday or thereabouts due to work/school schedules that, apparently, can't be adjusted in any way. I don't know what to do. I can't feed myself until then, and I really can't countenance the thought of sitting in this chair for the next 70 hours or so, but I guess I'm going to have to. My brother is just now moved out on his own and doesn't have the money to help me out, and my mother is in the process of moving away from her heavily alcoholic husband so she isn't in a position to do anything either. I don't really have anyone else, I'm pretty solitary.
If there are any Columbus redditors or any redditors flying through CMH who wouldn't mind buying a guy a cup of coffee or something, it would make this a lot easier. I'm just at a loss for what to do. Largely resigned to accepting the situation but it doesn't make it suck any less.


Edit: I got a lot more than a cup of coffee.  Two apparently pretty great people took me out to a sit-down restaurant and hung out for quite a while.  One of them is a redditor, I'll nominate him here for first class fellow if he tells me he doesn't mind being singled out in the morning, and his buddy too, though I don't think that guy is on here a whole lot.  Thanks!

On March 16th, we're bringing to life Joss Whedon's SERENITY!

Based on the gone-before-its-time TV Show Firefly. In the future, a spaceship called Serenity is harboring a passenger with a deadly secret. Six rebels on the run. An assassin in pursuit. When the renegade crew of Serenity agrees to hide a fugitive on their ship, they find themselves in an awesome action-packed battle between the relentless military might of a totalitarian regime who will destroy anything - or anyone - to get the girl back and the bloodthirsty creatures who roam the uncharted areas of space. But, the greatest danger of all may be on their ship.

Come prepared to see one of our most requested and favorite movies like you've never seen it before! Regular Admission $5, Teachers, Students, and anyone wearing any kind of costume $4, Military Free! Seating and Preshow starts 11:30pm Saturday March 16th, only at the Grandview Theatre!

Not sure what a shadowcast is? Made famous by the Rocky Horror Picture Show, it's a unique form of theatre art where, while the movie plays behind us, we act it out on stage and in the aisles. We encourage callbacks and audience participation! See our trailer for some examples... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOGI8aFH1jU

The Midnight Shift: More than a movie, not quite live theatre, and like nothing you've ever seen.

Any information will help.,daphuckinman,34,5,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/jvmwc/hit_and_run_on_bethel_road_and_godown/,"Last night me and a friend were out celebrating me being done with summer classes.  At approximately 12:00am we were crossing Bethel road on Godown road, a woman in a black SUV tried to turn in front of us as we were crossing the intersection and hit us head on.  She stopped and got out, she was visibly intoxicated, she saw that I was hurt (broke the windshield with my head, I'm fine but looked banged up at that moment) and she got back in her SUV and drove off (West on Bethel).  The cops didn't come for about 45minutes, in that time she drove by again in the same car slowed down where we were and took off.  We didn't have time to get her license plate #.  We filled a police report, and had 1 witness at the intersection who filed a report also.  My buddy only has liability insurance, he had to pay for the tow truck, and now has to buy a new car being that his is totaled.  He posted a reward on craigslist, I figured I would post it on here in hopes that someone might have some information that could help him find her so he can have his car payed for.  I'm sure he would even be willing to have it settled without police involvement if someone knows who the lady is who hit us.  Not trying to make a financial profit off the situation, just trying to help him get the money he deserves for a new car.  Thanks.

EDIT: Picture of his car the next day

EDIT: After his car got towed the tow truck driver put all the car pieces into his trunk.  He found a headlight cover that didn't go to his car, searched the number of it online and found that it goes to a Volvo.

We'll be teaching people the basics of padlock and deadbolt lock picking will be taught, and you'll get a chance to learn about the fun hobby of locksport while getting a little security education at the same time. We'll have a few locksport contests, a drink or two, and a lot of fun! Lockpicks will be available for loan or sale that evening, or bring your own. We will have some beer and snack available for free or small donation, or bring your own if you're picky. Everyone is invited, hope to see everyone there! Please RSVP at [our meetup page](http://meetup.com/li-columbus).

If you already know how to pick, come hang out with us anyway and have a beer!

But nothing has prepared us for our latest attempt to bring the movies to life.

On July 21st, the Midnight Shift presents ARMY OF DARKNESS!

In Sam Raimi's followup to the Evil Dead series, BRUCE CAMPBELL stars as Ash, a man out of time tasked with recovering the book of the dead before evil gets it's claws on it. However, his efforts to get the book result in an army of the dead awakening. Now Ash and a few untested soldiers must face off against a legion of undead troops led by his own dark half. Will he find a way home? How many shells fit in his boomstick? How in the hell are we going to do this?

Another first time ever shadowcast for us, this cult movie of all cult movies will be shown one night only with no guarantee it'll ever be redone, so get your tickets early!

Admission $5, Teachers and Students $4, Military Free! Seating starts 11:30pm July 21, and the movie starts at midnight, only at the Grandview Theatre! More than a movie, not quite live theatre, and like nothing you've ever seen.

That being said I really like movies and don't have a ton of cash. So I'm going to attempt this. I even took the day off work (with personal time, I've got bills to pay ;P). So if anyone wants to join me in this obscene quest, it would be fun.

My gameplan is to bring my iPhone loaded with movies and my 3DS (both with headphones of course) and try to sit in a back corner. This is going to amount to cruel and unusual punishment, but fuck it, you only live once, so why not waste an entire day getting free movie tickets for a year?

Let me know if you are interested, any company will be appreciated, right now I plan on going it alone :/

**UPDATE**: Sleeping may or may not be allowed. May or may not be plugs. Parking is basically $1 per hour, I'm willing to car pool with anyone who wants to chip in on parking (or let me park / walk from their house) Just know you will need to live pretty darned close to Gateway (as I'm coming straight from work, yay desk job).

Power cable for my phone / 3DS. Headphones. Change of cloths, pants and shorts. I realize this is mostly common sense, but I forget stuff sometimes.

The gas can was found on my back porch, so this is probably the dude. He didn't get away with too much, but some of it is irreplaceable: My Wii (serial No. LU60417716(0) if you see one for sale!) My PS2 (ha), my macbook (Serial No. W8828GYB0P0), some jewelry (my grandfather's gold cross necklace, a silver crucifix) and an old junky knife that used to be my grandfather's.

I've seen people tossing around Tuesdays at The Library. I've seen Surly Girl. 

I currently go to OSU, so I'll actually be leaving for home this coming week due to the holidays, so I say we start planning for a meetup sometime in January. Let's get some ideas and start getting something set in stone. I look forward to meeting other redditors!

Cheers



**UPDATE** 

Let's try to stay away from campus since parking isn't readily available and try to stay away from places with live music as it will be hard to converse with one another (unless otherwise agreed upon).

Meetup Possibilities: Winking Lizard, Surly Girl, Ravari Room, Grandview Cafe, The Press Grill, Fabian's, Barrel 44, The Blue Danube, Brazenhead, talk to COSI to see about starting COSI After Dark back up.


Let's try and organize a meetup schedule a month at a time to allow people to clear up their schedule if need be -- starting with January.

**UPDATE 2**

More Possibilities: Hampton's on King, Michael's Goody Boy, Cazuela's, La Fogota, Mac's, Short North Tavern, Bier Stube, Watershed or MiddleWest distillery tour -- $10 dollars a person up front, but if we get enough people together we can get a group of our own.

I'm going to throw together a makeshift calendar by the end of the year, and I'll post it to a new thread. Keep the ideas coming in the meantime!

",Buckaletta,29,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/d2tu6/westboro_baptist_church_coming_to_ohio_state/,"(cross post from lgbt) 

I know that the main thing WBC wants is for people to challenge them and give them attention. But I think it could be wonderful if we get a group of people to not only outnumber their hate with kindness but also put that to good use.

I'm thinking the donations could go to something along the lines of the Human Rights campaign or Freedom to Marry.
People could make signs and post messages about it to try and get as many supporters of equal rights out there to donate and overpower the WBC.

I unfortunately will be out of the country in October, but I'm willing to help organize and do as much as possible before I leave!

**edit** All we need is for a couple people to man a table with Donation signs and a collection box. I'm working on getting a permit to be able to collect donations from cars at the stop light where they will be protesting. If the permit is granted we'd need volunteers to work the intersection with donation buckets during red lights. 

I've contacted the Human Rights Campaign and they will be sending out stickers and posters we can use for the counter protest fund raising. 

**edit 2** A few people have talked about donating the money to Stonewall community center in the Short North, which is a pro LBGT community center.

This year we will be holding our local meetup at [Grandview Digfest](http://grandviewdigfest.com/), which will give us access to plenty of space, food, and alcohol. Come put a face to local usernames and hopefully make some new friends - these meetups are always a great time!

Digfest is held along [Yard Street](http://goo.gl/maps/Bs0dS) and the [Grandview Yard](http://www.grandviewyard.com/) area and is free to attend. The whole event is from 4PM until 10:30PM. The meetup will begin at 5PM, and we will take a group picture at 6:30. Right now the plan will be to gather near Yard Street, east of the Buckeye Hall of Fame Grill, but this may change as we learn more about the Digfest setup. We will do our best to mark the Reddit group with signage and this thread will be available on the /r/Columbus sidebar and updated as necessary.

Any out of town redditors visiting that weekend, please feel welcome to join us. Origins Game Fair is occurring at the same time, and Digfest is just a couple miles from the convention center.

FML,tibbon,37,11,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/113fub/house_next_door_burned_down_victorian_village/,"Last night, I was awakened by the sound of exploding glass windows and the rage of an orange fire feet from my bedroom window. The under-renovation house next door on Highland St in the Victorian Village caught on fire after sitting vacant for months while in theory being refurbished by its new owner (although work was maybe once a month at best). Firefighters suspect potential arson. Was evacuated from my house until almost sunrise since the flames were precariously close to my roof, and if not for the brave members of the Columbus Fire Department ours would have surely caught fire too as it was starting to steam/smoke. 

In late August, [an old lady was murdered maybe 5 houses down from me](http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2012/aug/29/7/police-investigate-shooting-victorian-village-ar-1154570/) by a homeless person (who they [allowed a $1M bond](http://www2.nbc4i.com/news/2012/aug/31/1-million-bond-set-victorian-village-shooting-susp-ar-1156526/) for... wtf?); of which there were many living in her house. 

Also last month, [there was a rape/robbery/kidnapping in the neighborhood](http://www.10tv.com/content/stories/2012/09/21/columbus-goodale-park-rape-robbery-bond-set.html) (someone's told me there have been two actually recently, although unconnected). 

I've had my garage broken into twice with things stolen. I've got homeless/vagrants in the alley nonstop, including a scrapper who has been arrested out there. The neighbor tells me that someone had tried to break into their house about a week ago when they were home at night but their large dog scared them off. I've found people passed out drunk in the alley (no, not OSU students) and called the cops, but minutes later the people were just back on the street. 

What. The. Fuck. Columbus? 

I've lived in 'bad' areas before and frankly never been so scared or disturbed before by local happenings. My last two apartments in Boston I never even had to lock, and went years with zero incident. Here I'm constantly checking my door locks, garage and watching my back walking at night. I'm not one to feel endangered normally and didn't mind walking around Naples, Italy by myself at night. 

I enjoy living in a part of town that's central, hip, historic, diverse and walkable. We got this place specifically to be far enough away from campus to avoid undergrads (success), but close enough for my girlfriend pursuing her PhD to walk/bike. Living in the WASPy depths of UA, Dublin or Marble Cliff seems so boring and car dependant, but damn... this is really getting out of hand. Why does the concept of living in urban areas Williamsburg, NY; the Castro in SF seem infinitely; or Somerville, Mass seem infinitely safer when they are clearly more urban and should be 'scarier'?

Not looking for any specific advice or anything, just venting and throwing this all out there. I just wish there was a way to help clean up the neighborhood and get some of the vagrants out of here (I somehow doubt my home-owning neighbors ares the ones breaking into houses, killing old women and lighting stuff on fire).

There was enough interest, so I made some arrangements! The management at [Momo2](http://momogroup.net/) have kindly allowed us to host the tourney there. 

It'll start at 1 PM on Saturday, March 3 and be BYOC (Bring Your Own Computer - also please bring an ethernet cable if you have one!), so if you plan to compete please try to show up between noon and 12:30 so that we can get everything set up!

The tournament will be randomly seeded, so there's really no need to sign up ahead of time - but if you plan to compete it'd be great if you could comment here so we have an idea of how many to expect.

Each match will be best of three, and the tournament will be single-elimination. There will be a $2 entry fee which will go into the pot to be split amongst the top three contenders. 

Also, MetalTeeth09 and BosskOnASegway have kindly volunteered to cast the event, so it should be a good time for spectators as well!

I will be cross-posting this to /r/OSU and the TeamLiquid forums, and will also be creating flyers to post around campus. Feel free to spread the word!

If there are any questions, comments, or suggestions, please post them here - other than that, glhf!

**Edit**: Regarding the ""Momo has bad internet"" situation:

I brought this up when speaking with one of the managers - he acknowledged that the wireless internet is spotty, but claims that their wired connection is better. Evidently they have an ethernet cable running through the ceiling somewhere that they can bring down and hook up to a router or switch that we provide.

So if anyone has a sufficient switch, please let me know! All I have is a 4-port router that I think my roommate would be angry if I unhooked for the day...",,False,self,t5_2r373,True,,,True,t3_p2ekr,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/p2ekr/starcraft_ii_tournament_march_3_at_momo2/,

Keeping with that theme, I will be creating a Google map for Columbus similar to [this map I made for the Bay Area](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210964343519592920584.00048f5dd6a12d20d341a&amp;msa=0) when I lived out there.

I have messaged the mods on this idea, and they have agreed that if the content of the map proves worthy, they'll add a link to the map in the sidebar for all of /r/Columbus to see!

**How you can help**

**1)** Suggestions on formatting:

* Should I keep/change/add marker formats?
* Should I add neighborhood boundaries (i.e. ""Short North"", ""German Village"", etc)?  Or maybe this should be a different map (Although I'm pretty sure there's a site out there that already provides this function)?
* Any other format suggestion

**2)** There are a number of threads *""what's the best place for ____""* in /r/Columbus, could you link me to them?

**3)** Have a place you would like to add?  PM me or leave a comment!

* Provide the precise location and the name you'd like to give the place.
* Provide a brief description I can give the place that sets it apart from other similar places in Columbus.

**4)** Feel passionate about this project and want to collaborate on it?  PM me and I'll add you to the Collaborators list.

1372018901.0,24,self.Columbus,1gxc3i,"Hello lovely people of Columbus, OH. I was wondering if you could provide me with some information. It's a very long post.",poppycocksnozzberry,37,13,22,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/1gxc3i/hello_lovely_people_of_columbus_oh_i_was/,"I appreciate you looking at this and wondering if any of you can provide my some information and areas around the web that may help me. Here's the TL;DR version: I want to get away from everything. How hard would it be for me to pack up a few things, and head over there with no job experience or a place to live? 

I am writing this on a throwaway account. Basically I want to run away. I want to get away from where I am and move to Columbus, OH. I want to start a new life. I am a 23 year old female living around the Dallas area. I feel so suffocated here. 

Here is some background information about me that will explain why I want to get away. I am the youngest of three children, and all my life I heard don't become like your brother and sister. They won't amount to anything. But you, you can do some much more than they can. Your sister is a whore and a slut, don't become like her and disappear in the middle of the night. That was all I heard from my mom. I guess my sister had enough of my mom saying that, so she moved from our home town to Dallas. She has been able to make it own her own and has a family. I idolize my sister for all that she has done for me, and for me to hear all this growing up I kept wondering what was wrong being like my sister. She is happy. 

I was told I have to get excellent grades so I can get into college. There was no other option for me. I have to get into college. This was my mom's plan. Get good grades, go to college, get a high paying job, and then support her once I got a job. I'm sure some people would wonder what is wrong with that. It seems like a great plan. My mother is the problem with that plan. All her expectations and every god damn fucking thing out of her mouth, and among other things, have left with me with low self esteem and depression. She is the most racist person I know. She's one of those people who will pretend to like you with a smile on her face, and than turn around and talk back about you. She would fit right in with the Westboro Baptist Church. She is just like them just not openly like they are. 

I got good grades and then went to a community college since it was cheaper than going to a university first. After two years I transferred into a university my mom wanted to to go. It was the one she went to. At the university I started off well. Went to classes, did my work, and got good grades. Well it didn't last very long. Since I was living alone with my mom paying for everything so I could just focus on school. I have never had a job since she didn't want me to have one, nor would she let me drive. I just learned how to drive last year. Well I'm sure you know where this is heading. I flunked out of school. I just stopped going. I could not bring myself to go. I had no friends, and I hated what I was studying for my degree. Of course she doesn't know. No one in my family knows. They all think I graduated this May. I flunked out two years ago. I have been holed up in my room doing nothing with my life. 

I was able to pass off not walking down and receiving my diploma by saying I didn't want to do it. My mom was asking when my diploma would get here, so I just said I forgot to apply. Now I'm pretending that I've applied to August's graduation. My family keeps asking me what I want for my birthday and graduation since my birthday is at the end of July. All I've been thinking is I can't live like this anymore. I just want to be free. All my life I have done nothing for myself, and the only thing I want to do is do what my sister did, to start a new life else where. I can't keep on lying, but I'm too far deep in my lies. All that thinking has made me realise I have done nothing with my life. I have virtually no friends anywhere near me, nothing holding me here at all. 

The reason I choose Columbus is because my only friend lives in Lancaster, OH. I would be near her where I could go visit, but far away where I won't become a nuisance. I can't ask her for help since she has her own problems along with a family she needs to care for. It wouldn't be right for me to just show up and burden her with my own problems. I know if I were to ask her for help she would do everything and anything for me, but her daughters should come first. 

I guess with all this I want to know some answers and where I can look up more information. I've never had a job before, so I know finding a place to hire me would be extremely difficult. Adding to that I would need a place to live before I probably could get hired anywhere. What would it be like for someone like me to just give up everything and move there? Maybe even go back to school for something I do love once I find what it is.

Immediately began rubbing against us - an indicator that she has been around humans and was perhaps somebody's pet recently (perhaps lost or simply dumped somewhere in the park of roses).  At the moment we have allowed her into the house to keep her safe (she could be somebody's pet, after all).

This sweet girl came to us from outside.  She showed up at our set of apartments, meowing away, and just would not leave.  We spent a while searching for her original owners, but none came forward.  She came from outside, and she very much needs outdoor time.  She is a very skilled hunter.  She will bring you many gifts, or clear out a campus house of mice.  We just moved from our apartment to a house we bought.  It is on the Summit/4th stretch of road so it is very fast moving traffic.  It seems the newest game she's developed is playing chicken across that road.  It is probably the most terrifying thing I've had to watch.  We tried to keep her inside.  She will barrel at the door and run out.  She is a very demanding kitty.

She like small dogs and puppies.  She is a very tolerant kitty.  She is a very submissive kitty, so she cannot be housed with other cats.  My cats, as well as outdoor cats, attack her because she submits.  She could be paired with a kitten in the future, a feline companion that would grow with her as its guide. 

She plays fetch with toy mice.  If she wants  to play fetch she will bring you the mouse and meow so cutely.  She will bring it back again and again... unless she loses it!  Then she'll ask you to kindly get it back for her.

Please someone, we've spent 8 months searching for her owners and then for a forever home for her.  Now she's playing a dangerous game and would be best on a slower moving street with a kitty-less house.

TL;DR:  You= kitty-less, slower moving street, no or small dogs... Please adopt kitty!  [Here she is!](http://i.imgur.com/JwilC.jpg)

Why? Because during the chaos that ensued (because of live chickens?), some students took advantage of the situation and stole cell phones and cash from bookbags that were left behind in class rooms. So, somehow, these two students are being held responsible for the crimes other people committed. 

Whatever happened to being able to laugh at life anymore?

I think it should be on Saturday, March 31st. I'm (selfishly) out of town the weekend before, and I think any earlier is not enough time for people.

The ideas tossed around:

* [Zeno's Bar](http://zenosbar.com/) - Where we had the meetup last March. They let us use the downstairs room for free, but also wanted $100 in gratuity.
* [**EDIT**] [Park Street Tavern](http://parkstreettavern.com/Default.aspx?site=Private%20Parties) - We can probably get the upstairs room. Catering optional, but there's a bar, plenty of standing room, and pool tables up there. I'll have to see about the cost, but this would be a great alternative to Zeno's if it's cheap.

For the Schmidt's and Barley's one, we'd have to ask for a cover fee to cover the costs of renting the place.

If anyone has any other ideas, feel free to offer it!

Overpriced Beer,
Topless girls that shouldn't be topless,
Mediocre music,
A handful of vendor booths of which most sell paraphernalia

It's not a music festival... it's just something to do because I couldn't think of anything else better.

This is an example of a worthy festival: [Summerfest](http://www.summerfest.com)

**EDIT**:It's not about who ""should"" or ""should not"" be topless at Comfest. It's about everyone else not having a choice of whether or not they want to see that. 

There is no reason to run around topless other than to receive attention from gawkers. At least the naked bike ride is trying to promote something. 

It's supposed to be a community festival and a family friendly experience of which Comfest is no longer either of those. I'm by no means prude, but I don't really feel like explaining to my kids why there are women running around without their clothes.

Not what you expected to read, was it?

Most go with the flow, most let people who are signaling in and out, most are reasonably patient in traffic.  In fact, there's a noticeable decline in driver quality on weekends compared to weekday rush hours when most people are working together so that we all get in to work.

Sure, we have the problem children but in sheer percentages, they're the minority:

• The Prius, Buick, Volvo, etc. driver camped out in the far left lane going 5 under in lower traffic

• The oblivious driver entering a busy freeway at 35 or 40 mph

• The impatient speed demon who believes tailgating me will magically cause the ten cars in front of me to speed up.  So then he jumps over, moves up, cuts me off and tailgates the guy who was previously in line front of me.  Dude, my car is faster than yours, I've had race training so I can go much faster too, but this isn't the time or place.

• Overconfident drivers in 4-wheel drive vehicles going really fast (65-70ish) in heavy snow.  Psst: 4-wheel drive helps you go, but your brakes are no better than anyone else's.

My only real gripe about freeway drivers is hospital curve on 315, where some people's capabilities or vehicles are unable to maintain posted speed or higher, so they slow way down - in the far left lane.  And that creates a back-up when it happens.

What's your take?

Since then I have put together the beginnings of such a site and registered a domain name, columbuswiki.org, but Wikispot has yet to update things on their end, so it doesn't quite work yet. Until then, http://columbus.wikispot.org will get you there. 

A community wiki would be nothing, of course, without a community that writes and edits it. So, here is a modest proposal: keep in the back of your mind that the wiki exists, and whenever you find a good place to walk your dog or a new place to eat, take a second and share your knowledge on the wiki. Nothing here is set in stone: feel free to add things to the front page and change around links.

Lastly, the links I have on the front page of the wiki are pretty typical: restaurants, businesses, and so forth. These are things that can be found in tourist guides. What I'd suggest is that we document some of the weirder or more unique things about Columbus, too, even though they may not fit into one of the categories listed.

Just wondering if /r/columbus has any insight. And yes, I'm aware of how extremely ignorant this question sounds.

Background Info:

My boyfriend runs a small mobile auto repair service through craigslist. He recently got a request to do some work, but once given the address discovered it's in Hilltop. He's new to Columbus (came from a TINY town in Iowa where he didn't have to worry about gangs and gang related crime) and I'm less than knowledgable about this subject. He's heard some pretty bad things about the area, like a coworker said he wouldn't go there without a gun since he's white. Is this a legitimate fear? Since the work he's doing is only about $20 bucks worth and he does drive around with a good amount of expensive tools as well as some high end sound equipment, he isn't sure whether going and helping the guy is ""worth the risk."" 

A quick google search shows that there have been a large number of thefts, burglaries, and assaults in the last 2 months, which I kind of expected.

YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN!

A young neurosurgeon (Gene Wilder) inherits the castle of his grandfather, the famous Dr. Victor von Frankenstein. In the castle he finds a funny hunchback called Igor, a pretty lab assistant named Inga and the old housekeeper, frau Blucher -iiiiihhh!-. Young Frankenstein believes that the work of his grandfather is only crap, but when he discovers the book where the mad doctor described his reanimation experiment, he suddenly changes his mind... 

This show will challenge us like no other as we attempt to bring this genuine classic to life before your eyes! Riff and laugh along with us and enjoy the most unique theatre troupe on Earth!

Regular Admission $5, Teachers, Students, and anyone wearing any kind of costume $4, Military Free! Seating and Preshow starts 11:30pm FRIDAY October 19, and the movie starts at midnight, only at the Grandview Theatre! 

The Midnight Shift: More than a movie, not quite live theatre, and like nothing you've ever seen.

 Sarah here! You may remember me from such posts as ""Moving to Columbus soon-- tips?"" or ""Good printers in Columbus?"" or the weekly Thursday bar meetups. I'm here to bring you another sweet opportunity here in Columbus!

 So as many of you know, I'm a ""professional atheist"" and I work for an organization here in Columbus. This, however, is not related to my work, this is just an organization I'm a part of and really like. It's the [Humanist Community of Central Ohio](http://hcco.org/), and it's a pretty ballin' organization. If you're not sure what humanism is, you should read [this](http://hcco.org/humanism) (because you might be a humanist already)!

So anyway! The point of this post is to invite you to the annual Winter Solstice banquet. They're going to be hosting [Jamila Bey](http://hcco.org/node/133) as a speaker, and she is fantastic. 

The purpose of the [Winter Solstice Banquet](https://secularstudents.wufoo.com/forms/hcco-winter-solstice-banquet-registration-2011/) is to provide members and non-members of the humanist community with a secular alternative for the holiday season. For the last several years, we've held our banquet at the Fawcett Center at the Ohio State University. Each year, we host a speaker relevant to the community. There are several pricing options for those with differing incomes levels. For questions or comments, contact Julia at coordinator@hcco.org.

If you'd like to register, you can sign up [here](https://www.facebook.com/HumanistOhio?sk=app_200103733347528)! It'll be a great way to meet new people in the area. Even if you are just curious about what humanism is or what these are like, it's gonna be a fun event, and I'll be there, along with lots of other cool people. :)",,False,self,t5_2r373,False,,,True,t3_mlqrc,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/mlqrc/are_you_a_humanistatheistagnostic_in_columbus/,
