While I think that's great, there are some things you need to understand about libertarians before you go around calling yourself one:

1) Libertarians are NOT Republicans - despite the fact that the media loves to use ""libertarian"" as a pejorative when referring to republicans, this is simply not the case.

While we are for small government, private enterprise and minimal/no taxes, we are also for personal freedom...

2) ""Personal freedom"" means ALL personal freedoms, not just ""stuff *I* like"". 

Again, while we are against gun laws and business regulations, we ALSO support the elimination of drug laws, DUI laws, anti gay marriage laws, anti-abortion laws, the Patriot Act, the militarization of the police forces - anything that restricts personal freedom.

Yes, that often means supporting the rights of people *you personally* don't like or agree with on religious or personal grounds.

If any of that conflicts with your own beliefs, then you either need to get over it or get back to the GOP.


3) We don't support war or imperialism

Yes, it sucks for you that the Bush/Cheney Project For a New American Century failed so miserably, and that Bush actually lied to you about WMDs so he could invade Iraq.

But you're not going to get much sympathy from most of us, as we are against imperialism, the military industrial complex,  and a worldwide US military presence to begin with.

If you have recognized that the ""superpower"" system has failed, great; welcome. 

If you're just calling yourself a libertarian to hide your shame at all the BBS posts you made declaring the Iraqis would ""welcome us as liberators"", that's a problem.

4) unlike the GOP, libertarian ideology does not march in lockstep. 

If you hadn't noticed, there are a wide variety of often competing and conflicting opinions and views under the Libertarian umbrella.

We spend more time arguing with each other than we do arguing with other parties.

If you're expecting to come in here and have every post greeted with  and ""Amen choir"" like  they do on Free Republic, you're in for a shock...

5) Bullying and slurs don't work here.

You can't pull that Rush Limbaugh/Bill O'Reilly crap here and expect to be taken seriously. As a group, we're just too diverse (and honestly, too intelligent) for that crap to work.

Also, calling someone a ""liberal"" has ZERO effect as an epithet, since 

a) We ARE liberal about many things

b) we don't think along a liberal/conservative dichotomy to begin with.

Just wanted to get that off my chest.

EDIT 1: I just logged in again and...holy crap. I had no idea this would spark so much conversation. 

Couple of things I should clarify from reading the posts:

* I never meant to speak for ALL libertarians or lay out any sort of dogma, which is why I used terms like ""generally"" and ""many"". I know better than that.

* regarding DUI laws abortion etc: being against repressive LAWS isn't the same thing as being FOR the behavior. 

I'm not advocating that people should be able to drive drunk; [I'm saying that violating people's 4th 5th and 6th amendment rights based on an arbitrary blood alcohol limit has been proven to be ineffective as a either a deterrent or a life saver, but VERY effective at lining the pockets of the local government and legal system.](http://www.duicenter.com/research/drunk_driving_politics.html)

Similarly one can be against abortion, but not for things like transvaginal ultrasounds or killing abortion doctors. Education and access to birth control would be less invasive and arguably more effective from a libertarian standpoint.

IMO, it's not your stance on an issue; it's how much you are willing to violate others freedoms to enforce your stance that determine whether you are a libertarian.

Thanks again to all who posted!!

EDIT 2: My apologies if I haven't responded to your individual post, but I'm absolutely overwhelmed by the response to this. For the DUI/abortion posters, please review EDIT 1 above before posting.

He (King George III) has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.

He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

He has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.

He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.

He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

For Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

For protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

For depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:

For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences

For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

He has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty &amp; perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.",,False,self,t5_2qh63,1367245294.0,,,True,t3_1dc42u,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/1dc42u/i_just_realized_that_a_lot_of_the_reasons_we/,

Well, perhaps you should start your own pizza chain across North America to compete with him.  Then you can make pizzas at cut rate prices and compete with Dominos/Pizza Hut but still somehow find enough money to pay your workers crazy high wages and give them free health care.  Hell, why don't you thrown in 4 weeks of paid vacation and a pension.

Or you can just keep playing with yourself and posting on reddit.

**Update:**
1) A few people have claimed I think papa johns workers are highly paid.  I don't know where you got idea.  My point about that above was saying, well if you think all pizza workers *deserve* healthcare then why stop there.  Don't they also deserve paid vacation and higher wages.  Where do you draw the line?

2) I probably did not need the insult at the end, sorry.

3) I never have suggested a boycott is bad.  Boycott all you like! Encourage your friends to do so if you please.  However, I think as a society this kind of crap will keep happening as long as some people feel they are entitled to other people's money and are willing to use the force of government to achieve it.   Then it will just be one company after another that's ""not doing enough""

In the other corner, we have the chest-thumpers demanding that we find somebody to shoot -- and shoot them.
I have a better idea: Stop trying to manipulate and manage history on the other side of the globe and then being shocked when things don't turn out the way we wanted. As far as what we do right now in response to the tragic events of this week, it's actually pretty simple. Get our folks out of places they don't need to be -- and out of harm's way -- and cut off every dime of U.S. tax dollars we are sending to clearly ungrateful regimes.""- Gary Johnson

This is a great opportunity to get a member of the Libertarian Party into Congress.,jebus5434,1071,232,66,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/zsnym/david_pangrac_of_the_libertarian_party_is_running/,"Here is David's Website.

http://www.libertyisprosperity.com/

Here is the official Facebook Page
http://www.facebook.com/Pangrac2012

Here is information about the congressional district.

http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Arkansas's_3rd_congressional_district_elections,_2012

With no Democrat in the race, getting involved will make a difference and a possible win for our Party. Show David some love, like his facebook page, make a donation, etc. If you live in Arkansas, sign up to volunteer and get on the front lines. A win here would send a message across the nation that third parties can indeed win. More so it would rub dirt in the Republican's faces.

His opponent has voted to extend the Patriot Act, pass the NDAA,etc. I think if people in the area can get democrats on board to unseat a Republican in the general election, we can do very well.

**EDIT** I've just been informed that in Louisiana. THERE ARE 3 congressional districts where its a Republican 1v1 with a Libertarian. No democrats in these races. 

Louisiana has a huge Ron Paul grassroots movement (one of the states he won a majority of delegates) There is no reason why we can make a decent showing in that state. Get involved and get out the vote people!

Here is info on the 3 districts.

I lean pretty hard toward the Democratic party and I voted for Barack Obama in 2008. I've always thought Ron Paul was a refreshing candidate whom I really liked that unfortunately fell short of meeting my overall worldview. For instance, I am firmly against those who do not value science (in his case, evolution) and thus do not support teaching it to our youth, especially for a person with his education. I am against wholesale dismantling of government agencies. I am against applying a tax system that while labeled ""fair"" actually is horribly regressive against the less fortunate in this country while a boon for the rich. I have yet to see any empirical or even historical evidence that trickle-down economics works as advertised. I am pro-choice. 

However, given the NDAA threat of indefinite detention, our perpetual state of 1984-esque warfare, and our overall military industrial complex at the costs of both money and human life, I have come to the conclusion that America needs Ron Paul. 

I may have to bite my tongue if he ends up getting elected and institutes measures I do not agree with. However, if it is the choice that represents retaining our constitutional rights, and if it is the choice that halts our disgusting military-industrial complex, it is a choice I am ready to make.

Today, I contributed to Ron Paul's campaign, and I plan on voting for him in the primary. ",,False,self,t5_2qh63,True,,,True,t3_nfu8t,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/nfu8t/i_am_a_democrat_i_am_voting_for_ron_paul_in_the/,

Get Gary Johnson into the debates!,OHhokie1,873,212,48,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/wn5h6/blackout_cnn_get_gary_johnson_into_the_debates/,"On July 16th, at 11:00 a.m. EDT, start tweeting @CNN , @CNNPolitics , @CNNBRK (breaking news) with the hashtag #BlackoutCNN

EXAMPLE: “#BlackoutCNN like they have blacked out @GovGaryJohnson ! Include him in your polling @CNN .”

Remember not to use the tag until the given date and time! Tweet for as long and as many times as you can and retweet as much as you can. Get creative, but be (somewhat) respectful.

*****************************************************************************

The third line of attack is a rolling call schedule for State Directors to use in conjunction with the Protest being Held at CNN. We will bombard their phone lines with requests to include Gary Johnson in their polling.

Generally, states are paired up to work together for 30 minute intervals EVERY DAY until we get what we are after. We need as many people as possible to help with calling especially if they are unable to actually attend the CNN Protest itself.

The Rolling Call Schedule starts on MONDAY JULY 16th and continues until we win! The calls should begin as a wave going from the East coast to the West coast producing a steady stream for at least 12 hrs each day.

CNN CALL NUMBER (404) 827-1500

STAY ON LINE UNTIL YOU CAN TALK TO THE OPERATOR. ASK TO SPEAK TO WHOMEVER IS IN CHARGE OF POLLING THE PRESIDENTIAL RACE. THEN ASK WHOEVER YOU CAN GET ON THE LINE SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

""I would like for CNN to include Libertarian Nominee Governor Gary Johnson in their polling for the general election because he represents my views on many subjects, ________ being one of them. Will you please begin including him in your polling?""

****************************************************************************

Our final attack will show our defiance of the hand-picked big government candidates! In combination with the protest and a twitter bomb, we are hosting a fundraising event to help Governor Johnson and Judge Gray during this protest.

http://fundly.com/blackoutcnn

Every dollar counts, and is a huge assistance for the campaign. Let us come together either in person at the event or on Twitter, but as well let us come together and donate $10, $25, or $50 towards the campaign and the efforts to be included in National media and the debates!

Every dollar we raise shows the media and the two-party establishment that we are fed up with the “choices” they force upon us.

Don't fall for the two-party-trap.,,1014,355,211,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/z6urq/the_republicans_are_not_libertarians_dont_fall/,"The GOP candidates often borrow from libertarian ideology for their speeches and rhetoric, especially in the case of defending capitalism, but their voting record on libertarian issues is ***ATTROCIOUS***. Here is a voting comparison for some of the most authoritarian legislation of the 21st century.

* **Patriot Act of 2001**, in the lower house, **99%** of Republicans voted Aye, as opposed to **70%** of Democrats.

* **Patriot Act Reauhtorization of 2006**, in the lower house **94%** of Republicans voted Aye, as opposed to **35%** of Democrats.

* **Patriot Act Reauhtorization of 2011** in the lower house, **88%** of Republicans voted Aye, as opposed to **36%** of Democrats.

* **National Defense Authorization Act of 2011**, in the lower house **81%** of Republicans voted Aye, as opposed to **50%** of Democrats.

It's clear as day now that it is the Democratic party that ~~actually backs~~ **opposed less vigorously** the libertarian position on basic Constitutional guarantees, and not the Republicans. The President is an exception to this rule, with his extra-judicial assassinations and signing of the NDAA and what not.

The Democrats are horrendous with economic freedom, but they are the party that is ~~serious~~ **a little more serious** about civil freedoms. ~~It's my opinion that economic freedom without civil freedom is an empty promise. What good are riches to a man in a cage?~~ **So bad I have to strike it out.**

----

**Tl:dr** ~~Vote Libertarian, if no one is running on that ticket in your district/state, vote Democrat. DO NOT VOTE FOR THE CHRISTIAN FUNDAMENTALIST CRONY CAPITALIST DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX PARTY.~~ This is bad advice, sorry, and thanks for the people that pointed this out. Voting for libertarian candidates is the best way to go regardless of party.

**EDIT** Christ I'm not endorsing the Democratic Party, I'm just pointing out the Republicans are worse, which some libertarians may be surprised by given the Republican rhetoric. Not voting doesn't make bad politicians go away! You gotta vote for the best choice available (hint: there are more than two choices), even if it is objectively shit, if it's relatively good you increase their chances of winning over the bigger evil. Not voting may make you feel like some ideological champion but guess what, that just increases the chances of bad dudes winning elections. 

**EDIT2** And when I say vote for a Party, I mean't it's *platform*. Of course there are outliers who don't represent the party platform that require special consideration. For heavens sake vote for Ron/Rand Paul or Justin Amash if you can.

**EDIT3** Damn I see a lot of good points in this thread. Feel stupid about this post now. Thanks for commenting guys. Just feel this unholy rage towards the Republicans right now for being deceitful fucks. Voting for libertarian candidates is the best way to go surely regardless of party. If I wasn't a retard and worded this post better, I should have said: Don't trust ~~the~~ **most** Republicans lies about them being for freedom.",,False,self,t5_2qh63,1346538368.0,,,True,t3_z6urq,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/z6urq/the_republicans_are_not_libertarians_dont_fall/,

On the one hand, [67% of all homicides](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_violence_in_the_United_States#cite_note-4) in the United States involve guns in some way. That's pretty scary. On the other hand, [52% of all homicides](http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/homicide/race.cfm) in the U.S. are committed by black people.

67% involved guns. 52% were committed by blacks. It might seem that blacks are clear, but not quite. See, [47% of Americans](http://www.gallup.com/poll/150353/self-reported-gun-ownership-highest-1993.aspx) keep a gun in their homes. On the other hand, fewer than [13% of Americans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_United_States#Race_and_ethnicity) are blacks, and presumably, not too much more than 13% of American homes contain a black.

So now it's looking pretty rough for blacks. 67/52 = 1.29, but 47/13 = 3.62. To be clear, there are 3.62 times as many gun owners as blacks in America, but gun owners only manage to commit 1.29 times as many homicides as blacks.

To phrase it another way, blacks are about 2.8 times more likely to kill people than gun owners. It is literally true that if you meet a random gun owner, and a random black, the black is 2.8 times more likely to kill you than the gun owner.

**Do statistics like these mean anything at all?** Do black people cause murder? Do guns cause murder? Or do **murderers** cause murder?

Just to be safe, I think we'd better outlaw blacks before it's too late.

The video and audio was tampered with (erased) by the feds, but recovered with open source software and linked within. ",rightc0ast,915,300,103,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/dhf7b/the_redditor_arrested_a_few_months_ago_for/,"Redditor /user/georgedonnelly sent me a message this morning thanking us for the support. At the end of the video, he thanks the 165 redditors who donated, and in the middle of the video is a screen capture of the original submission. Warning: onions are cut at 13:00 :)

Sympathetic supporters skilled in computer forensics [have now recovered the audio and some of the video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3YIhJyVwTs), which shows George personally was *clearly* only documenting the interactions and was attacked without cause. Win one for the people. Especially redditors who supported and upvoted this a few months ago, and the programmers who help build these tools. Thank you all, from George. 

The TL;DR is that George was arrested for filming the interaction between Julian and the officers. This is all in the video, and at the end he thanks reddit for our help. The swarm of calls to the facility made the jailers deem him a ""superstar"". You are indeed powerful Internets, and the support pouring in for George clashed with the announcements the guards made to the prisoners that George was coming in and he ""was the next Tim McVeigh"". 

The video sheds a lot of light on the unjust attack, but mostly it shows that any single instance of something less than complete docility might make even federal marshals abuse their power when they perceive an uppity civilian. Though Julian touched the badge of the court security officer, saying she wasn't actually a marshall, everyone there was immediately seen as guilty by association, and the video clearly shows an unprovoked attack on George, many minutes after Julian's mistake. The statements of the federal officers are also shown to be false by the video. They lied, simple as that.  

I'm sorry for any disjointedness here. I'm just writing from my heart. I'm still as upset about this as the day I called when they threatened to sic the FBI on me for harassment as soon as I said ""someone needs to do the right thing and demand his release, so that's why I'm calling."" I'm not the only person who was told that, many of you probably were as well. So this is hard for me to watch, being so passionate about our rights to film and protest peacefully without being forced to divulge personal information and personal details on demand.

After all, do we truly have free speech if we are arrested for acting on such a right? Without a right to action beyond this anonymous online speech, any right to free speech regarding things like Iraq protests under Bush, or photography now ... is purely imaginary.

Thank you for helping the people who risk so much protecting these freedoms for us all. Thank you all.

They say he is the greatest president ever, when simply logic and a clear mind will tell you that he is far from even being a tolerable president. 

Liberal Redditors treat Obama like he is a Hollywood celebrity. Here is my evidence: http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12x02e/the_president_of_the_united_states_of_america/

 http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/12ww1m/i_saw_this_plaque_in_chicago_on_a_rock_at_the/

http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/12vzel/obama_tearing_up_as_he_thanks_his_staff_today/

And these are only a few examples recently.

They always say, ""He is a president I'd love to have a beer with"" or ""His charming personality won me over"". And if you so much as even mention his MANY faults, they attack you, and call you 'evil' or 'un-human' or 'un-American' or ... 'conservative' or 'retarded'. Then they will proceed to put spread these lies about Obama. ""He loves the enviroment, he loves immigrants, he loves gay people, he loves the economy, etc ..."" Which is bullshit when you consider the facts that Obama has kept on subsidizing the oil corporations, has expanded oil drilling, has DEPORTED more illegal immigrants than any other president in history, has stated PUBLICLY that he WILL NOT seek gay marriage legislation in his next term, and has bailed out Wall Street, corporations that were propped up by GOVERNMENT and in collusion with government to rob the American people further ... and Obama thinks MORE regulation and MORE government involvement is going to solve the problem in created in the first place? Give me a fucking break.    

Now don't get me wrong, I think Obama has a great persona too. A charming personality. But should that negate all of the terrible shit that he has done and will continue to do? That was a rhetorical question. The answer is NO! 

Reddit liberals will always say that conservatives live in a bubble. Where Reagan is the ruler of the world. But liberals have there bubble too. A bubble where Obama is a progressive that loves gay people and the environment. When, if you look at the results of the last 4 years ... Obama seems to be a far right fascist. 

And that to me ... is reprehensible.   ",,False,self,t5_2qh63,False,,,True,t3_12xfvm,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/12xfvm/rant_time_anybody_else_disturbed_by_reddits/,

My representative is David Schweikert of Arizona. At first when he introduced himself I was a little taken back, but he said he wanted to hear my opinion about auditing the fed. After explaining how Congress has the authority to manage and regulate monetary policy in the Constitution which has been delegated to the Federal Reserve, they have every right to check their books, he said he was amazed that I knew that and agreed  with it completely. Then he went into a little rant about the Fed as well, (it felt like he finally had someone to talk to about this issue lol). 

We then talked about monetary policy for a bit, he is currently on the Committee on Financial Services with Ron Paul and said that the two of them are good friends, he said that as long as he's in congress and running, monetary policy will always be a big issue for him and will always be a critic of the federal reserve.
He's a very nice and funny guy, and it really restored some of my hope that we have some people looking out for us and actually caring in Congress. He's running against another republican this August in very tight race here in Arizona. Here's his info, show him some love, like his Facebook account, follow him on twitter. It's the few people like this that we need to keep in office, and it would be unfortunate if we lose him his year.

So if you are concerned about Iran, you should vote for me. You have no other choice.""

   ""But you said that you don't mind if Iran gets a nuclear bomb?"" 

Ron Paul: ""I also don't mind if Israel attacks its nuclear facilities. Not so long ago, I was almost the only voice who refused to condemn Israel for attacking nuclear site of Iraq. Israel doesn't have a better friend than me. If you are concerned about Israel, you should vote for me.""

I'm normally very liberal on most of the issues, but taking away gun rights is not one of them. Lately I've been having to come here to get a breath of sanity. It's like the whole world's gone mad on all the news sites/stations I frequent. Everywhere I look it's ""gun control! gun control! GUN CONTROL!!!"". It's like a beast has finally been awoken. 

The whole thing just feels like one of those scumbag memes. ""Scumbag liberal friends: You can't legislate away people's (reproductive/marriage) rights! Tries to legislate away your gun rights."" 

I just can't seem to get them to understand that the way they're acting is like conservatives with regard to abortion. There's no reasoning with them either. They're whipped up into an emotional frenzy with the images of dead children in their mind and so they want to punish me, a law abiding citizen who already had to jump through hoops and background checks just to get my CWP.

I only wish they had this passion when it came to other things that actually helped society. ",,False,self,t5_2qh63,False,,,True,t3_16omrp,http://www.reddit.com/r/Libertarian/comments/16omrp/i_wish_my_liberal_friends_were_as_passionate/,

Even John Adams after the Boston Massacre knew who important a fair trial was regarding the British soldiers. Due process is one of the things that makes the US one of the greatest, if not the greatest, country to have existed. We were founded on certain principles and to not follow them, even in the most trying of times, would be a slap in the face to our country's founders.
