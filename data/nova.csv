I am in need of a flash mob. I am a chairperson for Stillbrave which is a childhood cancer foundation for the DC/MD/VA area. We have a little girl who was just recently diagnosed with brain cancer that we are helping. We provide non-medical assistance to families that are dealing with this crappy thing called cancer. Well...this little girl hasn't been doing so well. She's lost her appetite (which is fairly normal with chemotherapy) and is having a hard time right now. Tara's dream has always been to be a princess. So we are making that dream come true. We have reserved a horse drawn carriage for Friday May 3rd. Tara's mom is having a princess tea party for her and her friends. Our director, Tom, is dressing up as Prince Charming. He will go to her house, put a glass slipper on her little foot and then take her and her friends for a carriage ride.

Now here is where you can come in and help. We want to make her feel like the most special princess there is. So we want to get a large flash mob of people lining the main street the carriage is going to take holding up ""Princess Tara"" signs and cheering her on.

I mean...who wouldn't want to be a part of making this little girl smile? We want this to be big! We want people cheering and yelling and just going nuts for this little girl. She needs a pick me up so she can fight this horrible disease and go on to have many more of her dreams come true. So who's with me? All it will take is a little bit of your time and enthusiasm.

We'd like to keep this hush hush so it's a real surprise for Tara.

Here are the details:  

When:  Friday, May 3, 2013 

Time:  Lining up around 6pm…we’ll be picking Tara up around 6:30pm
Where:  Start lining up at Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow Rd. (they won’t be able to see us from their house)

Who:  ANYONE!  Everyone!  Bring your kids, bring your pets, bring whomever wants to make a little girl smile.  And bonus points to anyone who makes signs &amp; decorates them with “Princess Tara” and princess type stuff.

If anyone would like more details or to help please feel free to contact me at: donations@stillbrave.org

Also check out our site to get more details about what we are doing: www.stillbrave.org

Thank you all....I've read so many stories about Reddit users coming out to help people like this and I hope I'm proved right about how awesome you guys are :)

Kel


Edit:  I corrected the street name to Brandy.  


***UPDATE 5-1-13***
Okay I've talked with Tom (Stillbrave's director) and have a little more info.  Tara's mom will be bringing her home at 5:30pm.  So to avoid the possibility of them seeing a large crowd out there we are asking that everyone meet up at the Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow intersection closest to Rt. 50.  We want to keep people off of Stringfellow any closer to their until we hear that they've made it home.  At that point us Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will get you all in position.  So we can go from from that intersection back towards Rt. 50 and we should be fine.  We can also have people line up on Brandy Station on the far side.  Don't worry...we will be in Stillbrave TShirts so you all will recognize us.  If you're not sure where to go just find one of us and we'll direct you to the right area.

We do not know what route the carriage will take yet...it'll depend on the crowd.  

***********************************


**UPDATE 4-26-13:  Parking...I've spoken with a resident who lives in that area and there is ample street parking for normal use.  This event might go beyond the normal use spectrum.  So here are the options:  There is a pool on Stringfellow for the community that has a parking lot.  I'd use that if you have really small kids, the elderly or any handicapped participants.  For all others the best bet would probably be to park in Greenbriar Shopping Center on Rt. 50.  It's about a 1 mile walk from there to Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow.  A fairly easy walk for most of us.  

Both corners of Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow will be the staging areas.  Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will be on hand to get you in position.

Lastly (for today at least) are there any videographers out there willing to donate their time to come out and record this for Tara?  We'd like to be able to give her a DVD of it that she can watch anytime she's feeling down &amp; needs a pick me up.  Please contact me at:  donations@stillbrave.org if you are interested in donating your time for this.

I've lost my grandfather's watch. I went out last night and had a few too many drinks at the Clarendon Grill (in Arlington) and lost it at some point last night (I'm assuming).

My grandfather's birthday would have been today, just three days shy of it being a year since his death. My grandmother gave me the watch after he passed. It is a black Skagen watch with a blue face and a metal band and clasp.

I know this is a long shot, but if anyone found such a watch or knows someone who did, please message me. I parked at the intersection of N. Fillmore and 10th street. I walked north on Fillmore to 11th and walked west to the Clarendon Grill. At 11 o'clock I hopped over to American Tap Room for a beer and then made it back to the Grill where I finished out the night. My friends walked me back to my car, the same way I came walked to the Grill, and drove me home. My assumption is that somewhere on the walk back to the car it slipped off my wrist. Or, potentially at the Clarendon Grill (although they didn't find it).

Thank you for your help!",,False,,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,t3_1j85y1,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1j85y1/please_help_me_find_my_watch/,

After four hours of hard work, I found the X-Wing. My nigga DeadlyDolphin was a big help, props to him. Tgg161 was talking about wanting to bring his son out to see it, and that just had me all teary-eyed, so here's how you get there.

1. Go to LakeVale Swim and Racket (or whatever the hell it's called)

2. Walk down the hill until you get to the backstop.

3. Walk left of the treeline until you reach a filled in pumping station.

4. There will be a path you follow across a creek. After you cross, go left.

5. Be looking on your right for a deep run-off lane, go up it till you reach peoples back yard.

6. Walk along the fence for 2 houses and, BAM, x-wing.

If you know what you are doing, it takes no more than 10 minutes to find the thing. Good luck Tgg161!

It doesn't seem malicious, but it's so strange that I just want to understand.  Someone has been throwing fruit into our yard.  My family and I live in Vienna, more towards the Wolftrap area.  Yes, we ate the fruit.  No, we didn't die. Here's a description of each incident:

-At about 5PM on July 31, my dad came home and found a banana in the driveway.

-Later, around 11 or 12 PM, I walked outside and found about a dozen bananas in our lawn and the sidewalk.  Only one was broken.  It is possible that these bananas were present when my dad came home at 5 and he didn't notice them because they were fairly far from the driveway.

-The next morning (August 1st), I found tons more fruit in the lawn, including 3 seedless watermelons (1 broke), 1 broken cantelope, 1 pineapple, 8 bananas and 3 apples.  The larger fruits must have been carried onto the lawn rather than thrown.  They must have been placed between 1AM and 7AM.  My dad set up a trip wire that night (fishing line attached to pans that would fall at make a racket) in an attempt to catch them in the act, but they did not return.  We thought that this was the end of it, since the fruiting stopped for several weeks.

-Today (August 17), my mom found fruit in my Jeep at about 1PM.  It's parked on the curb and has the windows off, so they probably didn't open the doors or anything.  The loot this time included a watermelon, a pineapple, and 20 apples.  What odd about this is that we've been on vacation all week, and my mom and brother only got home last night.  The fruit seemed pretty fresh, so it's almost like they waited til we got home to fruit us again.  Of course, it could be a couple day old, since all the fruits they throw keep pretty well.

Our current suspects include:

-some of my brother's friends.  They're the type that would find this funny, but my brother denies any knowledge.

-my friends. Seems more unlikely, since college friends are home for the summer and hometown friends wouldn't waste that much money on fruit.

-Random teenagers who think it's funny (but they're spending so much money!)

-An estranged relative

-Some mysterious benefactor who is concerned that we're not getting enough fruit in our diets

-construction workers (first fruiting occurred during repaving, second while they are tearing down a house up the street)

-neighbors across the street messing  with us - I threw a grapefruit into their yard on a dare about 10 years ago, perhaps this is very belated revenge.

So, Reddit, do you know anything about this?  Has something like this happened to you or someone you know?  If you are the fruiter or know the fruiter, please know we're not mad and are very appreciative of the free fruit.  We just want to know what the fuck is going on.

My name is Joshua K Farrar and although I've never been much of a redditor (more of a /b/rother) I need your help!

I'm running for the House of Delegates in Virginia's 48th district (Arlington, part of Falls Church (see map: http://www.vpap.org/elections/district_redistricting/148))

I'm collecting signatures and support of my fellow Arlingtonians? to get on the ballot; I'm running to make sure the Virginia government doesn't pass anything to impede your use of the internet, mess with the lives of anyone regardless of race, gender, or sexuality, and try to work on issues in the recent transportation bill that was passed (like the NOVA-specific .7% sales-tax increase)

In short, I'm a libertarian, or a Liberty Republican; the Libertarian Party will support me, and we're seeing if the Republicans would run a candidate.

If it helps my cause, I know Node.js (javascript), PHP, Ruby (on Rails!), bash, perl, html, and css, and enjoy rainy days on my laptop looking at pictures of cats or practicing my mad Zerg skills (platinum league).

tl;dr: like my facebook page, follow me on twitter, and get involved to protect the rights of ALL of the people and the internets :D

* Kabob, everywhere (I actually love this since I'm Middle Eastern)
* No U-turn allowed more than half the time
* Bus and metro are nice, clean and on time (only one I have tried before this is NYC)
* Lots to do and see
* If you look hard enough, you can find a good affordable place to live (I'm sharing a 2br/2bth condo in Alexandria for $,1000 all incl.)
* Lots of beautiful young professional women, mostly in their 20's and 30's, but they seem somewhat unapproachable (I'm no pick-up artist though). Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've noticed that they are all quite the same; skinny/underfed, fashionable, brunette, look educated, walk with a purpose, wear high boots, half look pissed off at something, most are 5'-6"" and up with an unusual number being 5'-10"" and up (what's in the water here?). It reminds me of an episode of Family Guy when Chris was explaining this type of woman to his boss.
* People love to drive in your blind spot, without their lights on
* Everything I need is within a few blocks
* The only good mall is Tyson's Corner
* Gas is $0.20-0.30 more per gallon
* Grocery bill is higher
* People walking dogs and dog parks everywhere
* Xfinity cable customer service sucks

EDIT: Forgot a few things

* The same street has three names. Sometimes the large sign will say something like ""Braddock"" and the small sign will say ""W. Braddock"". Which one is it motherfucking sign people? Luckily you actually have a sign. Sometimes the streets are at an angle, so you have ""S. Glebe"" and ""W. Glebe"" and hope for your life that you're in the right lane when you exit 395 or you're fucked, unless someone lets you cut through or you pull some move. Also, all you see is ""Glebe"" since the ""S."" or ""W."" is in subscript.
* My GPS (Google Maps on my Android) is often just as lost as I am. When I first moved here it had me turning in circles (""make a right, make a right, take next right, make a right"" = circle). I once made a dozen lefts and rights in under two minutes and gave up on it and just followed my nose. I now choose to take what she says as an opinion, rather than an instruction.
* People cross the street wherever they feel like, especially if they're not white. I swear they slow down their walk if they see you coming. Maybe I need a dash cam.
* Doing a quick run to Chipotle or grocery store around 5:30PM? Good luck finding parking. 20 stores in the shopping center, 20 parking spots. Same thing with the gym.

It is super difficult to meet other part time families or even full time families that are looking to make friends outside of their small circle. I run my own company, which doesn't really help for reaching out to coworkers, because I have none.

A little about me.  I am a loyal friend and good person.  Attend church almost every week.  Row, Swim, play some video games, work on my laptop and at nights when I have my daughter, take her out on small adventures.  The mall ""kid area"" or something fun for her to do.  But that doesn't really help her to make real friends which I so dearly want for her.  She is only 19 months old and is so loving, helpful and caring.  She is a great little person as I do my best to raise her properly with a lot of parenting.  I am in the Fairlakes/Greenbriar area so small families around there would be great.

Its very easy for single moms, because there are plenty of groups for them, but for dads, its a bit tougher as there are no dad groups for us fathers.

 r/NOVA WILL be observing Global Reddit Meetup Day after all! We are hosting a BBQ/Potluck at Lake Fairfax. Last year about 30-40 people showed up and we had a lot of fun. Bring your family, friends, and pets out to enjoy the great weather this weekend.

I'll be at Lake Fairfax around 12pm to lock down a good spot and place signs to direct people to our location. Feel free to come early and help out!

There will be a donation box to collect money for the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit organization that works to defend your rights in the digital world. I'll match donations up to a total of $50.


Since this is a potluck, please bring food or an item on the list below to ensure that we are well prepared. I'll do what I can to supply some of these items, but this will definitely be a community effort.  Leave a comment mentioning what you would like to bring and I'll put your name next to the item:
Coal - Ibrahim
Lighter Fluid -
Meat -
Buns -
cheese -
Chips -
cookies -
plates -
utensils -
napkins -
cups -
condiments -
Bottled Water -
Grill Equipment (spatula,tongs) -

More updates to come.

2) New management for the event and they didnt start the sign ups early enough for them to pull it together (far more likely).

I've been in cars that broke down, had flat tires, with the worst smelling people, people who won't shut up, and even one that was infested with fire ants. 

Yesterday afternoon was the worst though. The car was insanely hot inside, granted it was only 75 but she insisted on the windows remaining up and the AC off. Why? Because she was talking on the phone halfway home. That's not the worst. After she hung up she proceeded to text, nonstop. During this time she was listening to some kind of hiphop with the bass turned way up. Then she *started to sing* at the top of her lungs. When we were one light from the commuter lot, it turned red and she didn't want to wait the 45 seconds for the cycle, and we spend an additional 5 minutes cutting through parking lots. 


It seems as though many drivers are forgetting simple slug ediquitte:

- Turn your volume down. I don't care if you want to listen to your strange folk music but I don't want it blasting in my ears. We all prefer to just keep it on WTOP. It's smart.

- Keep the damn car climate controlled. If you don't have A/C, allow the windows to be rolled down. 

- Clean your damn car

- If you have a carseat in the back, either remove it or do not keep it in the center seat. It makes squeezing in very difficult.

- If you have a small coupe, pickup, or mini, don't get huffy if someone like me doesn't want to ride in it. I'm 6' tall and have a bad knee. I'm not going to spend 1-1.5 hours folded like a sardine... it's painful.

- Don't talk on the phone, and especially don't pipe it through your car's speakers. I don't want to hear about your spouse's doctor appointment.

- Don't text. Our life is essentially in your hands. I **will** say something to you if you text and drive.

- Don't drive like an ass. See above.


*That being said, I should be fair... for slugs:*

- First up gets first choice of seat. I don't care if you're a woman and the driver is a man. Just because he's a dude doesn't mean he's going to rape you in the front seat of a car. Have some sense.

- Turn your headphones down to a reasonable level. 

- Don't talk on the phone, unless it can't wait. Ask if it's ok. And put your phone on vibrate.

- Take a shower.

- Don't get in the car right after having a cigarette. you stink up the whole car.

- If you have a large bag, offer to be in the back seat.

- From /u/woodsbookswater : Don't douse yourself in perfume or cologne

- If you're in the front seat, offer to move the seat forward if you have room. Don't sit in luxury while the guy behind you is cramped in agony.

**One more note: If you drop off at Rosslyn, the drop off point is across the intersection, just past  the little park with the tables. The crosswalk lasts less than 10 seconds and it's annoying that you can't take the time to drive 50 more feet.**",,False,,t5_2riyy,1366298530.0,,,True,t3_1cj0kd,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1cj0kd/a_reminder_to_people_who_pick_up_slugs_and_hell/,

I recognized that this was an odd line of questioning, but being in the gown I couldn't really just up and walk out. When I said ""no"" he asked why and told me that I should find a church and start reading the bible starting with the old testament, and develop my relationship with god since ""he created us and created everything.""

1352213796.0,58,self.nova,12qbjl,[Cross-post from /r/sandy] POST-SANDY SCAM ALERT DC METRO AREA,ubsr1024,64,6,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/12qbjl/crosspost_from_rsandy_postsandy_scam_alert_dc/,"Hello /r/nova, I received a call from a scammer yesterday and let /r/sandy know about it. Someone suggested I post about it here too to let you guys know. [Here's the original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/sandy/comments/12omqh/post_sandy_scam_alert_dc_metro_area/)    
    
We live in Northern Virginia, just got a call from a man claiming to be from Dominion Virginia Power (Our electric company).    
    
**Details of the scam:**    
- He claimed that when the power was restored to our area after the hurricane, there was an electric power surge associated with it and it damaged our circuit breaker and other equipment.    
- He said it was an emergency and that the equipment needed to be replaced immediately or we might face an explosion/house fire.    
- He said there would be a truck at our home within 10-15 minutes, we needed to have $300 in payment ready.     
- When asked if it how much it would cost/how we'd be billed, he claimed he needed the payment immediately.    
- We asked about payment, he said he couldn't take checks, that we needed to run down to CVS and get a Green Dot Card with $300 prepaid.     
- He provided a phone number 1(888)201-8125 ext. 1604        
    
We were considerably suspicious so we called the official Dominion Virginia phone number and the number he provided.    
    
**What the secretary said at the phone number he provided**    
- The payment was due immediately    
- She knew our home address, our Dominion Account Number, the names of all the adult aged residents in our home **who were authorized to access the account/make changes to the account**.    
- She could arrange the payment to be lowered to $200.    
    
**What Dominion Virginia Power told us:**    
- There was no record of a call    
- There was no issue with our equipment    
- It sounded like a bogus call.    
- Dominion doesn't have a fraud department, the information would be passed on to management, we should report the info to the police.    
    
**Update**    
We filed a police report with Fairfax County PD.    
    
**Update 2**    
The person called back at 3:15 PM asking if the payment was ready. We told them that if they really wanted to, they should come on over and the police would be waiting for them. They hung up, having called from a new number this time. 1(800)611-9437.    
    
**Update 3**    
We contacted Fox 5 News DC. Extremely awesome people there, they are calling Dominion Power and the phone numbers the scammers provided. They will be coming out to interview us about the attempted scam for a report they are doing. I'll keep you guys posted about whether or not it will be airing tonight.    
    
**Update 4**    
Karen Gray Houston of Fox 5 just left after interviewing us about the scammers. She asked about how we handled the situation and one of the things I mentioned was warning people about it on Reddit. She wasn't familiar with Reddit but hopefully they include my sort of shout out. I told her it was an excellent news source! She isn't sure yet if the story will air tonight or later this week.    
**Edit:** The piece aired the same night of the incident. Good work, FOX 5 DC!    
    
**Update 5**    
The plot thickens... Karen Gray Houston has spoken to Dominion Power about this incident, apparently the first number that the would-be scammers called us from [1(888)201-8125] was once registered to Dominion Virginia Power. These people aren't messing around, this screams ""Inside Job"" for a lot of reasons. Dominion also confirmed to her that they would **NEVER** call about doing work inside a customer's house.    
    
[Airing now](http://www.myfoxdc.com/category/237285/live-newscasts)    
    
**Update 6**    
So they aired the story tonight, I really hope this was enough to get the word out. Thank you so much to everyone at our local FOX station for putting that together so quickly and doing such an awesome job. If any of you guys have family in areas affected by Sandy, drop them a line and remind them that there are predators like this out there right now. Stay safe everyone.

So there are two statewide ballot questions.  The first is pertaining to the 'veto' session of the General Assembly.  It allows for a join resolution to delay the veto session by one week (currently it is required to begin on the 6th Wednesday following the close of the General Assembly to only consider vetoed legislation).  My understanding, and according to the Board of Elections website, is that it will allow a week delay to not interfere with religious holidays, including Passover.  Anyone against this?  And why?  I'm leaning towards voting for it but I would love to hear arguments for and against it.

The second question pertains to eminent domain and, if passed, limiting the use of it for ONLY public use, not to sell it to private enterprises to promote economic development.  This push began after the Kelo v. City of New London decision by the US Supreme Court sided with New London, CT, allowing them to exercise eminent domain to buy private residential property for a private developer to build a shopping center and other things.  My memory is hazy but I was living in CT at the time.  I'm 50/50 on this.  What are your thoughts?

Finally there are the bond questions.  A total of four for parks and rec (not the show!), public safety, libraries, and storm and drainage.  I'm for this, but, again, would love to hear otherwise!

1 - Ask me anything about the industry
2 - Ask me for job advice 
3 - Ask me to check out your resume/tweak it
4 - Ask me for a job?

That means the police can pull you over if they suspect you are doing so. 
It is also interesting to note that while West Virginia banned the use of cellphones while driving, Virginia only banned the use of text and emailing. This might prove to be useful in the future if you get pulled over. Switch apps to GPS or something and you should be able to escape a ticket. Just remember to be polite to the officer.

Found this lovebird wandering outside my apartment yesterday, starving and exhausted. His wings are clipped so he couldn't have gotten far, and he must belong to someone. He has a tag around his left ankle (checked, we believe it's a breeder tag and doesn't link to any personal information). 

If you or anyone you know in the Falls Church area has lost their pet please PM me!

Edit: FOUND HIS HOME! The woman was very happy to have her bird ""Sushi"" back safe. Turns out his mate back home was missing him terribly! 

Edit 2: I went to all the surrounding pet stores to ask to hang up fliers. At the very last and farthest store, I walked in with the poster and the cashier WAS the owner. She was super relieved and happy. She pulled out her phone right away and showed me pictures of the bird and his sad mate. 

ALSO, did people know that Petsmart does not let you hang posters for missing animals??? Seems like very little care is given for animals for a store that claims to be all about animals! All other stores were more than happy and (the bigger ones) even made copies to hang at all the registers.

Not a soul was inside except the old Asian couple working the place. But it smelled nice and had a fairly standard menu for a short-order BBQ joint. So I figured what the hell.

When I went to pay with a CC, the lady asked if I had cash. I said sure but asked why. Then she told me today was the last day they'd be in business. After ~25 years she's closing the doors for good tonight. She said she'd appreciate not having to wait for the money :(

So I sat there and ate in silence. Just me and my dry brisket sandwich, which came on a cheap hamburger bun without any garnish and not enough ""spicy"" bbq sauce, which was definitely Kraft cheapest ever bbq sauce. My side of potato salad was freshly scooped from a Sysco jug, and the Kraft box brand mac &amp; cheese was obviously reheated from a day past. But in spite of all that, I couldn't help but feel horrible for the lady. I wanted to throw out my plate about halfway through, but out of sheer guilt I forced myself to eat every last bite.

I had to yell at people to move and push but there was little anyone could do. I'm really amazed nobody got hurt too bad.

Really, the metro staff should have turned off the escalators, knowing they were gonna get the Nats game crowd for 5 different stops all getting off at Ballston for the shuttle.

1352442119.0,40,self.nova,12who3,Tales from a Fairfax County precinct,A_Suvorov,47,7,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/12who3/tales_from_a_fairfax_county_precinct/,"I volunteered to work at a precinct polling place in my home county this year. I thought y'all might be interested how things happen here.

Poll workers start arriving at four in the morning to set up the polling place and the polling machines. We'd all been trained in this to some extent, so it went off without a hitch. The precinct, located at a High School, was open and ready by six.

There was a huge morning rush as everyone tried to vote before leaving for work. This died down a lot in my precinct, but the other precinct in the building had a line that stayed at 20-40 minutes long through the entire day.

This brings me to that the main challenge for us was the fact that there were two precincts voting in the same building. There was huge turnout, and a large number of voters were first-time voters. We had signs up to differentiate the precinct, but no one had any idea which precinct they were supposed to be voting in. To add to the confusion, one of the two precincts shared its name with the polling place, so everyone who had not read their card thoroughly enough or who had simply used a ""find my polling place"" search thought they were in that precinct. And unfortunately, this precinct had a huge line. So we'd have people waiting in line for 40 minutes, getting to the front, and subsequently learning that they were in the wrong precinct when we inputted them into the computers. 

So basically, a lot of the work I was doing was intended to minimize this. I was practically harassing people to make sure they got in the right line. I tried to ask every voter as they walked past the hallway junction where they would have to turn to choose which precinct to *try* to confirm their precinct by number, not name, to make sure they got in the right line. I helped confused voters by looking them up in the handy AskED device that allowed me to input their name or address and it would tell me their precinct. I walked up and down the line multiple times yelling about the two precincts. A few people got mad at me. And a few of these same people walked trying to not make eye contact with me, having just been informed by the registration people that they had been waiting in the wrong line for an hour. But all in all, we were pretty successful in making sure everyone got in the right line the first time around. Interestingly, the turnout at one precinct was massive compared to the other. There was a huge discrepancy in the lines (often there wasn't even a line for the other precinct) the entire night, even without the people who were in the wrong place. Some people laughed at this, some people seemed frustrated. All the people in the precinct with the short line were delighted. 

Another issue we had was with people who had moved. Some of them had changed their address with the DMV, and the DMV is supposed to inform the County elections folks of the change. This doesn't always happen, and many of these people were faced with the hard choice of being forced to cast a provisional ballot at their new precinct or driving all the way back to their old one to vote. So, tip to all you voters, when you move, call both the DMV and the County/state elections office. Make sure your information gets changed *everywhere*.

We only had one voting machine malfunction all night. One of the electronic machines crashed. The voter using it at the time swore that her vote got counted, but a discrepancy later revealed in our numbers seemed to indicate that it did not. Perhaps what happened will never be known.

The length of the lines in the polling place peaked from 5:00 to 6:15. It slowly wound down after 6:15. Everyone who was in line by 7:00 was allowed to cast their ballots. Fortunately, no one showed up late so I didn't have to turn anyone away. 

After the polls closed, we printed records from the two types of voting machines--the electronic and the optical scanners. These tickets were examined and signed for. The registration computers were also totaled to see how many voters in total showed up. Then an hour was spent putting all these numbers into data tables (the official precinct report--we do the counting of ballots on site), double and triple checking all the numbers to make sure everything added up.

Also, we reboxed and sealed all the machines and equipment, all the paper ballots, and all the paper receipts and records. Everything had to be signed by multiple election officers. Eventually, all the results and machines and everything were boxed up and shipped away by our precinct's Chief Election Officer. 

Also, I'd like to share a few anecdotes from the precinct.

We had one guy come in and ask where he could vote for the casinos. Me and the voters standing nearby laughed as I told him ""Wrong state, man. This ain't Maryland,"" and (jokingly) offered directions to the Wilson Bridge. Well, turns out the guy was actually serious-the only reason he showed up was to vote for the casinos-and he turned around and left looking a little sad.

Also, there are a lot of people in this county with any combination of any particular Vietnamese first name and the last name Nguyen.

Some tips for voters, other than the change of address deal above, in no particular order:

-The rumors are true. It will go faster if you vote by paper ballot.

-Check your precinct number before going to your polling place. If two precincts are voting there, it will be nice to know in advance which you will be in. I often had lines of people in the hallway shoving their drivers licenses at me asking me to look them up. I was totally fine with this (it gave me something useful to do), but I feel that it would have gone smoother for everyone if it wasn't necessary. 

-Bring a book. The lines may be long.

-Try to make (non-political) conversation with the people around you in line.

-Plan ahead. Make sure you have enough time to vote.

-The elderly and disabled can do curbside voting. Call ahead or send a relative or friend in to ask an Election Officer. It goes fastest if you send a relative/friend in with your ID so that you can be checked in the computer straight away. 

-If you note that there is an Election Officer or Page or anyone else directing people in the building, when you finish voting take a second to tell them how long you stood in line. This is helpful because it allows us to answer the question that gets asked a lot: ""how many minutes is the line?""

-And for the love of God, please at least flash a smile at or give a nod too the frazzled looking Election Page standing in the hallway. Trust me, it makes our day!

Hello NoVA people.

I need to part ways with one of my best friends, Rupert (full name: Admiral Rupert Reginald Mittons). I'm out of college, the land of cheap rent, and don't have the money for the $500 non refundable pet deposit for my furry man at my new apartment, and Mom says I can't afford his upkeep, anyway. In addition, I'll be moving in with my boyfriend, who is allergic.

Here's an album of him sleeping in cute positions, which he does a lot: http://imgur.com/a/KGhaW

He's the coolest cat. A chill orange tabby that loves to run around outside if you have the space, or cuddle up and take a nap with you. He's funny and a little too smart for his own good. He's never been around kids, but I imagine he'd be great, because you can pick him up, twist him around, do anything you want, and he'll just sit there and purr, happy as anything. He's only 2 years old, about.

I am in tears writing this. I am loathe to give up such a one-in-a-million cat, but feel it is for the best. I want to find him a great home, one he deserves, and I figured some cool reddit folks might be helpful...

He'll come with food, litter, litter box, even a brand new furminator/nail clipper combo. 

edit: here's another photo of him doing what he does best just today: http://imgur.com/dIta71L

1336840324.0,38,self.nova,tjsi1,Redditors in VA's 11th district: I'm a redditor running as an independent for Congress. Can you help? ,Marchetti4Congress,58,20,21,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/tjsi1/redditors_in_vas_11th_district_im_a_redditor/,"My name is Peter Marchetti, and I'm running for the US House of Representatives in Virginia's 11th District.

I need help. I have been gathering signatures almost entirely on my own. Time is getting short, and I need help getting enough signatures to get on the ballot.
If you are eligible to register to vote in VA's 11th district you can circulate a petition sheet on my behalf.

I am running on a platform of:

One law for all: The powerful elite and ultra-rich live by a separate set of rules - things you and I would go to jail for they get off without any repercussions.

End ALL the wars: Iraq, Afghanistan, the War on Drugs, the War on Terror, etc. They are not accomplishing our goals, they enrich and act as recruiting tools for our 'enemies'. They are used as bludgeon to scare the US population into sacrificing our liberties for the illusion of safety.

Civil RIGHTS, not privileges: The US government operates under the illusion that our Constitutionally guaranteed rights are in fact privleges that we only get if they decide we should. Laws like the PATRIOT act, CISPA, NDAA 2012, etc seek to erode our rights in the interest of the security of the corporate/government complex.

Sustainable energy: We will run out of oil as an energy source the moment our energy return on energy invested reaches 1:1. This will happen far sooner than we expect. We need to get ahead of the curve and develop sustainable energy while we have the excess capacity in the system to invest in the development of it.

Stop the looting, Start prosecuting: Wall Street banks and other corporations flagrantly violate the black letter of the law, knowing that because of regulatory capture at most they will pay a fine that is a fraction of their profits. Fines are just a cost of doing business: PROSECUTE!

Those are just a couple points of my platform. I'm an independent progressively minded individual who believes in basing public policy on data and evidence of effectiveness, not rhetoric and ideology. If you disagree with my ideas and opinions, and can show me the data to support your position, I am willing to change my mind. We need more average Americans challenging the powers that be in their own arena: running for public office. My interests lie at the macro level - thus I am running for office at the Federal level with no prior political experience. I am untainted and unencumbered by obligations to special interests or corporate interests.

I want to be a Congressman for the opportunity to represent American citizens and their best interest, to protect our rights and freedoms, and to help our society transition to a more sustainable model.

I will do an AMA later, right now I have to go out to collect signatures.
Please, if you are interested in helping me gather signatures, send me an e-mail at marchetti4congress@gmail.com

Anyone who's familiar with that area knows it's pretty much deserted at night with almost no pedestrians.

A black car pulled up to me. It was carrying 2-3 black men. They began yelling slurred insults at me. (""Get in the car"", ""Bitch why you don't answer"", and ""Imma put my dick in you"" were the top three.) I thought they would leave after a few seconds of me not responding, but they kept it up for about 2-3 minutes, slowly following me as I tried to walk as fast as I could.

I did not say anything or acknowledge them the whole time. I wanted to pull out my phone and call the police, but was scared that they would get out of the car and jump me. I was terrified because there were literally no open businesses or stores that I could run into for shelter. Everything on that street was dark and closed.

They eventually turned back west and drove away. I saw that the car had DC license plates that ended in 7402. I called the police after I got home and gave them that information, but they probably can't do much about it.

Two that were most attractive to me were Avalon Arlington Ridge and Eaton Square. Both properties provided easy access to 395 and a pretty nice commute to work in Clarendon.

What attracted me to Eaton Square was the location and cost- it was considerably cheaper than Avalon, although the buildings weren’t as new.

I should have realized how important a good living space is on your overall mental health then.

Avalon wanted a $500 deposit plus a $400 amenities fee- pretty steep considering we haven’t even discussed rent yet. So I went with Eaton Square.

A couple of things about the neighborhood- This is Alexandria, just across the boundary of South Arlington just off of 395. There is a very large immigrant population in the area and the Eaton property is next door to older and lower income properties. It’s not uncommon to see clothes being dried outside on clothes lines, kids toys strewn across common areas, and Spanish music blasting from open windows.

Avalon was immune to most of this, I think, because of it's higher cost. Eaton, not so much.

After signing the lease and doing the inspection, I found that the floors squeaked. These weren’t hardwood floors. No, these were carpeted floors that squeaked. The leasing consultant said not to worry, that it would ‘settle once you move your stuff in.’

My floors weren’t the only floors to squeak, the upstairs neighbor’s floors also squeaked. LOUD. Every movement upstairs could be heard in my apartment below. In addition to this, I could very easily hear the neighbor through the wall screaming at her children to go to sleep, or wake up and go to school.

The road, Florence Drive, is also used as a cut-through for the major roads, West Glebe and Mt. Vernon Ave. I heard traffic constantly.

I had noticed that the bathroom didn’t have a fan in it, just a window. But it wasn’t so abnormal, many houses are like that. However, I didn’t realize until a week later when I went to cook that the kitchen didn’t have a hood vent above the gas range.

A gas range with no hood vent.

Nope, just a kitchen window. 

Aside from the possible physical danger, the other issue you have with this type of  setup is nebulized grease when cooking. I had to wipe down things constantly or a thin film of grease would form on everything in the kitchen. Grease is food, and when you leave food out, guess what you have?

Roaches. 

But I’ll come back to that.

One of the sheer genius pieces of design in these apartments is that the HVAC vent intake is in the kitchen. So now you’re cooking in the kitchen with no hood vent, and when the heat/AC comes on, the smell and nebulized grease goes right into the vent resulting in the entire apartment smelling like what you just cooked.

I like eating fish and bacon, but I had to quit cooking it.

http://imgur.com/a/Pf9F3#tirQZkV

I think Bainbridge, the company that owns Eaton Square, really wanted to market this property as being one with a washer and dryer in the unit. However, due to space limitations, they were pressed to find a place to put these appliances- therefore they went in the closet that had the most room.

Well, the washer and dryers weren’t put in a closet at all, they were put in the pantry. The pantry IN THE KITCHEN.

As one who cooks, trash inevitably is generated. At Eaton Square, there is a charge for trash service- which absolutely blows my mind. The trash dumps are at the bottom of the hill which is often crowded with broken furniture, old TVs, mattresses, and a mountain of trash bags. If only the management company would invest in one, just one, additional green box, you wouldn’t have things like this:

http://i.imgur.com/SmhYmAL.jpg

With trash piled on the ground like this, rats are attracted- and yes, I’ve seen them. I’ve seen rats, stray cats, dogs and one opossum. Thankfully I’ve had no rats in my apartment, but I don’t see how they haven’t been a problem.

In regards to roaches- I'm not going to be the typical disgruntled tenant and flip my shit over a bug. I’ve seen them on several occasions. The first was in the living room, the second was in my bed. I woke up to something tickling my arm- roach. NOPE! 

The pest control company was promptly sent but after checking in my utility closet, I feel like they didn’t spray, but only dropped in a few roach traps and left.

**The Earthquake and Hurricane Flood**

If you live in Virginia, you’ll probably remember the earthquake we had in August 2011, and the hurricane that followed right after. Some refer to it as Hurriquake, which sounds like something you would get at Dairy Queen.

It wasn’t evident until after the hurricane (which wasn’t really a bad storm at all, the derecho was way worse), that the earthquake had somehow cracked the building , allowing rainwater to seep in right around my living room window.

I mopped up what I could with a towel and walked down to the leasing office to let them know about the damage and that water was coming into my apartment. The leasing consultant that I spoke to in the office said that someone would be sent to fix it.
This. Never. Happened.

Every time it rained, a little bit of water would seep down the wall behind my couch. Not enough to cause any concern, but enough to discolor the paint and crack the drywall.

It was over a year before this was addressed, which was precipitated (no pun intended) by… 
 
**The Bathroom Flood**

Over three days I watched the paint on my bathroom ceiling blister. I realized right away that this was because of some type of leak so I ripped the peeling paint away and felt the drywall- yep, leak. 

The entire ceiling was wet and soft to the touch. I had no idea if this was waste water so after I immediately washed my hands, I walked down to the leasing office again to tell them about the issue, and remind them that no one had been sent to address the leak in the living room.

A week went by.

After being more than patient, and the stain on my bathroom ceiling growing every day, I filled out an online maintenance request. Ironically, I got an immediate response and someone was sent right away to fix the issue…or so I thought.

The leak was just painted over, and a week later, the ceiling fell in- exposing just how thin the walls and floors were between the units. Broken, soggy, drywall lay covering my floor, shower, sink, toilet- even on my toothbrush (I threw that away).

Again, this was potentially some type of health issue so I walked down to the leasing office again IN PERSON to make them aware. A week later, the ceiling was fixed along with my living room wall/window but not before maintenance left a few stains in my carpet.


**The Kitchen Flood**

This was the final straw. I was standing in my kitchen in early February when I heard running water. At first I thought it may have been the sound of the drain until water started pouring from directly above my counter and raining down behind my cabinets and fridge. I had to throw quite a bit of food away since it became waterlogged and again, no idea what the water was from. A nice amber colored pool had formed in the light fixture in the kitchen- potentially a fire hazard. 

Immediately I called the emergency line at the leasing office and left a message. I was called back within 15 minutes and was told that the ‘on call’ maintenance was in Rockville, Maryland- 24 miles away. Luckily the flooding stopped.

http://imgur.com/u7izjZq

**Other things to note:**

**Common hallways** – are open to the public. The carpet in these areas are often ripped and trash/ takeout menus are usually strewn about.

**Club flyers** – People that live here are going to find a lot of these stuck under their windshield wipers or crammed in their car door window seals:

http://i.imgur.com/zi11fBJ.jpg?1

Although I had this stuck in my door jamb and liked it so much that I've held onto it ever since:

http://i.imgur.com/w4wGWuU.jpg?1

**Closet space** – is microscopic, even for a guy. If you choose to live here, you’re going to get a bedroom closet that’s only about 42 inches wide.

**Key fob for gym** – I lost mine. I went down to the leasing office in person as I typically do, to ask for another one, but I was told to come back next week since they didn’t have any to give out. Weird. 

I came back next week, was told they still weren’t in and to come back next week. 

I came back next week and they still weren’t in and was told to come back the next week. I said no and gave them my phone number and email address, asking to be contacted when new key fobs arrived. 

I was never contacted, and I’ve been a Gold’s Gym member because of that for the past year.

So the opportunity to snag it was there. Also the car has laser locks, meaning it is hard as hell to hotwire. On top of that no glass was left at the scene, meaning forced entry is not likely. My sister says she lost a key at my cousin's house, between the dates of May 18-May 20. Meaning it is likely that it was actually stolen from by one of the drugies without her knowledge. The car had GPS but not lowjack, the Audi dealership said they can't track it through the GPS which majorly sucks.

She sunk a lot of money into this new car, and is moving to Cali with her Marine boyfriend tomorrow...so kind of urgent. And the cops aren't following any leads or doing anything short of putting it in a nationwide database.

The [Car](http://i.imgur.com/78aWc2K.jpg) has Pennsylvania plates. License Plate number jdy-0084. Last seen on 306 Ainstree Court, Vienna, Va 22180. The car is also automatic.

Please contact me and/or the police if you have any information. Thank you. We need to stop it before it ends up in a chop shop.


My suspicion is if this was someone that stole my sister's keys a month ago than they have already got a buyer and the car is probably gone. But I am hopeful. I don't know if they would go and try and sell it on Craig's List. But I figured that would be a good place to sell off parts if they don't have a chop shop, or think they can make more money on their own. I was told that tires and wheels are the first thing they would probably sell off the Audi online. My sister doesn't know for sure what kind of tires she had but I think they were goodyear size 225/50R17.
The party was 2 days ago.

We welcome ANYONE that wants to learn about guns and get some experience. You do not have to own a gun at all.

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started. All the Redditors that have attended the events in the past have had a great time.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, stance, and safety procedures. You'll learn about different guns and be able to shoot a wide variety of handguns, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.
Look for the Reddit sign to find our group: [Armed Alien](http://i.imgur.com/eFH0O.jpg)

**Please do your best to not be late!** Try to be in the lobby by 9:45am. We'll put you into a small group prior to entering so we can share lane. If you do come late, just ask to go to the rifle side and look for the alien on my range bag. You'll probably have to pay your fee and fill out some paperwork to gain admittance. If they hassle you, tell them to page the Pink Pistols group and I'll come out and help you get in.

Cost is between $10 and $20 for entry (depending upon the number of range members in attendance). If you don't bring a gun of your own please bring $10 (in small bills if possible) for a pool to cover ammo costs of those that bring guns for your to shoot.",,False,,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,t3_xk5sj,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/xk5sj/you_want_a_new_experience_reddit_pink_pistols/,

* Light 3 turns green, but nobody can go because everyone from 395 is now blocking the box.  Meanwhile, Light 1 is still red.
* Light 1, finally turns green for a short while, so everyone from the 395 ramp can go, except that the light turns red again when those who were blocking the box get to it, which doesn't leave much for those coming in from Light 3.  Of course, the zombies at Light 1 take their sweet time, so that doesn't help anyone either.


Light 1 should just be green when Light 2 turns green so that line can be cleared out.  Fuck everything about this intersection.  Also, good luck if you're in the left lane of S. Glebe and need to make a right on W. Glebe.

My first time posting and I desperately need help. My situation is pretty horrible. I am looking for a place to rent. I have been looking for the last 2 months. Up until yesterday, I had a place I was going to live until the landlord pulled some sneaky move on me. I gave this landlord $1400 as a holding security deposit and it would be applied as my security deposit if I moved in. This $1400 was half of all the money I had to my name. He guaranteed me that If I gave him the money he would rent to me when I was ready to move out on Feb. 1st. So now Im ready to move out and I go to talk to him and make sure its ready and he tells me he rented it to someone else who outbid me. Then he proceeded to tell me how he didn't have my money anymore and he spent it. I called the cops but it could take up to 2 months for me to get my money back because of court. I only have 3-5 days to move, and I only have $1400 as a deposit now, or I will be homeless. So basically what i am asking for is advice, help finding a rental i can get into by the first, if anyone is trying to lend me enough money that I could get me a place, or however you think you can help me. Any and all help will be greatly greatly appreciated. I'll just post the ad I have on craigslist so you know more! 

I Live in Manassas, Virginia 20110 and I need to find a place in Manassas, VA 20110 thats at least a 2 bedroom.

If you cant help me, can you at least up vote. That's help enough!

The service is **ALWAYS** terrible. This is not a one or two time thing.  This is constant.

This is not to say that everyone that works there is incompetant.  Though my group of friends and myself refer to it as the ""Land of Misfit Food Service Workers"" that were denied work every place else, there are two people that have been genuinely pleasent people to talk to.

 I was walking down Chain Bridge Rd. to Auld Shebeen last night around 11 PM. It was really dark, so I'm not sure how I even saw it, but out of the corner of my eye I noticed a small shadow in the corner of one of the bus shelters for the Cue. It looked like an empty wine bottle but I decided to investigate it anyway. When I picked it up I realized that it was an unopened and untampered with bottle of Macchia Zinfandel. I don't really drink wine but I was excited to have found this treasure and I texted my friend who I was meeting at the bar that I'd be smuggling a bottle of wine in with me. I'll include a quick excerpt of our text conversation. This is where it gets weird:  


 Friend: You can't bring it into a bar.    
 Me: I have deep pockets, they'll never know.   
 Friend: Did you find it on the ground?  
 Friend: It's a trap.  
 Me: Yeah how'd you know?  
 Friend: You found it in a bus stop on 123 didn't you?  


 At this point I was WTFing pretty hard, so I hid the bottle in a bush and continued walking to Auld Shebeen. When I got there my friend explained that over a year ago her roommate found an unopened bottle of wine in that exact same spot. The bottle was surround by a ring of coins that seemed to be arranged into a deliberate pattern (it was too dark when I found the wine so I don't know if there were any coins around it). Her roommate considered taking it, but was suspicious and left the bottle where it was. The next day it was gone. Then a month later she found the exact same setup again. A bottle of wine surrounded by a ring of coins.   


 I ended up bringing the bottle home with me, but I have been too weirded out to open it. We tried to come up with some sort of explanation for this, but we can't imagine what would motivate somebody to leave a perfectly good bottle of wine in the same spot over and over again. We thought maybe somebody was leaving it there as a tribute to somebody that could have died on that spot, but it's not like it's Poe's grave. It's just an ordinary bus shelter. And it still doesn't explain the coins.  


 Has anybody else ever found a bottle of wine in this location? Does anybody know anything about this at all?  


**TLDR: Found a bottle of wine in a bus shelter last night. My friend's roommate found a bottle of wine in the exact same spot on two different occasions over a year ago. When she found the bottles they were surrounded by a ring of coins on the ground. wtf**",,False,,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,t3_wk89r,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/wk89r/the_curious_incident_of_the_wine_bottle_on_chain/,

I've been renting since 2006, and up until last year I was paying (more or less) $1200/mo for a 1 bed, 1 bath in Fairfax (Fair Lakes), no utilities included, every year.

I'm happy with my place. It's nice, feels like home. But, all of a sudden, rent in Fairfax has shot up like crazy. The place that had a market rent of $1150 in 2009 when I started living here now has a market rent of **$1510** and, it's only going to get worse - they're installing granite and stainless steel appliances in the kitchens so they can call them ""luxury"".

My place has gone up $100/month each of the last two years. I refuse to pay nearly $1500 for a 1 bedroom apartment miles and miles from the nearest Metro stop when my lease is up in April. I've come to terms with the fact that I'm going to be moving.

Reddit, can you help?",cookthatshit,41,8,58,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/r8j28/i_am_cookthatshit_and_i_want_to_cook_pho_for_the/,"Last year I submitted to [reddit my pho recipe](http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/mdhxa/every_week_i_make_my_friends_and_i_pho_and_it/) and it got 100k hits on imgur alone is less than 24 hours. I was shocked. I answered questions for 10 hours straight, and even had people sending me photos of making pho just hours later. Since then I've been [updating the post from feedback here](http://jonkwheeler.com/pho/).

I thought it would be really awesome to cook pho for the homeless one day. I'm not looking to make a profit, just to donate my time, and perhaps raise money for charity. There's always this one guy in cargo shorts and a huge beard who comes up to me asking for work. I never have anything for him. Couldn't we at least provide people like him a meal for a day?

I posted this on my facebook back around xmas time and it was well received for people wanting to help and donate their time. Although most people just wanted to eat my pho.

If I was to picture it, I'd set up shop at the Clarendon Metro park. There's enough room there to hold this on a saturday or sunday morning, and go through most of the day. Homeless eat for free, others pay and the money goes towards helping the homeless get cleaned up, a bed to sleep, and a shot at a new life.

Here's the funny thing. Technically* I am homeless myself. I would be a homeless person cooking/helping the homeless, which would be quite interesting I think.

*I lost my job back in late August. That's when I started the pho post. Then had to give up my apt in December. Been a nomad ever since. Doing freelance and raising seed money for a startup now, which I've talked about on my [other account](http://www.reddit.com/user/spadevdesign/). I've traveled a lot, and crashed at friends places. I told myself to follow my dream of building a company because I've always wanted to help people. So that's what I'm doing, spending a year going for it, so I can live with no regret.

Wrapping up, can you help me organize an event to make this happen? I'd even do it in DC, and for that matter, anywhere it was allowed. I have nothing but time to donate for a good cause. Couldn't there be a way to get a few sponsors to donate supplies and ingredients?

*So, can you help?* 

[You can contact me on twitter if you like as well](https://twitter.com/jonkwheeler).

**TL:DR; I'm the pho guy on reddit, and I would like help organizing an event where I can cook pho for the homeless.**

[**Pho for the Homeless Sign Up Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGR3YUxFdUFvVVhKNGR5Y2xYbmNyaEE6MA#gid=0)

I'm going to set up shop here - [**http://www.phothehomeless.org/**](http://www.phothehomeless.org/)

*No date or location has been set. This is simple saying that you are interested in helping.*

We would like to invite Redditors to our event again as it has been a good time with prior get-togethers. **All the Redditors that have attended the events in the past have had a great time.** We welcome ANYONE that wants to learn about guns and get some experience. You do not have to own a gun at all.

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, stance, and safety procedures. You'll learn about different guns and be able to shoot a wide variety of handguns, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang. Look for the Reddit alien sign to find our group: [Armed Alien](http://i.imgur.com/eFH0O.jpg).

**Please do your best to not be late!** Try to be in the lobby by 9:45am. We'll put you into a small group prior to entering so we can share lanes. If you do come late, just ask to go to the rifle side and look for the alien on my range bag. You'll probably have to pay your fee and fill out some paperwork to gain admittance. If they hassle you, tell them to page the Pink Pistols group and I'll come out and help you get in.

Cost is between $10 and $20 for entry (depending upon the number of range members in attendance). If you don't bring a gun of your own please bring $10 (in small bills if possible) for a pool to cover ammo costs of those that bring the guns you'll be shooting.",,False,,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,t3_13zvni,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/13zvni/want_a_new_life_experience_reddit_pink_pistols/,

The veggies in the dishes are especially great here.  I love the shrimp with vegetables.  They have other Asian dishes on the menu as well and even make a pretty good Pad Thai.  The appetizer menu is pretty standard but they seem to put some extra care into preparation so that things always come out tasting fresher than the other places I've tried.

Please try to stop by there every few weeks if you can so that they can ride it out until the road reopens next year.  They do have a good deals on the lunch menu for those of you working in town.  They do deliveries as well.

I enjoy cats, of course. Hiking, biking, dancing, exploring, video games, movies, occasional drinking at bars, museums, laser tag, road trips, random outings, shopping, exercise, the occasional toke, being spontaneous (to a degree), psychology, and so on. Mostly, I'm just a normal, not-normal girl who likes to have a good time with good people.

I have three great cats, but owning that many has put a lot of stress on me and is, I feel, unfair to the cats. I travel a lot and two of the cats are fine in the car but the third absolutely hates it.

She's an orange tabby, about 8 years old, named Sookie. I got her at 6 months of age and she had one health scare where I nursed her back to health and shouldn't happen ever again. (Long story short: if a cat experiences undue stress they can become anorexic and then their liver shuts down. Force feeding fixes that and it almost never happens again.)

She loves people and really would just prefer to hang out with a person all day, either on their lap or next to them on the couch. She trusts new people extremely quickly and loves both men and women. Because of this, I would not call her high maintenance at all because she has never damaged a thing, but she really is a bit needy in terms of attention. All she wants to do is be near you. A 9-5 job is fine as long as you can hang with her most evenings. She likes to ""talk"" to you as well. This is not a cat that will hide when company comes over! She loves meeting new people.

She's absolutely unfazed by dogs but generally not a fan of other cats. This is why I would prefer to rehome her as opposed to my other two cats, who are best friends. She has no behavioral issues, always goes in the litter box, doesn't really mind having her nails clipped and doesn't scratch on anything excessively (the few times she does it, I use a water bottle to spray at her and this seems to be nipping that problem in the bud). She doesn't scratch or bite. Really, if she's annoyed, she'll just let out a grumble. As I type this she's curled up on the back of the couch just above my head and purring.

I would charge a fee of $50 to weed out the crazies, which I would then donate to my local SPCA.

I'm open to her being rehomed in all areas of Virginia, DC, and southern Maryland. I can send more information to anyone interested.

Besides that, does anyone have advice on rehoming pets? I'm not getting rid of her until I find the absolute perfect home.

My boyfriend lives in Alexandria so that would be a good meeting space, as I am up in NoVa just about every other weekend.

[Here's a gallery of pictures of her.](http://imgur.com/a/3tuwv) She would be an excellent cat for a first time cat owner because she's extremely affectionate, sweet and never gets into trouble.

* Time:	 	10:00 am - 12:00 pm
* Location:	Blue Ridge Arsenal, Chantilly, VA

The Pink Pistols (an LGBT + friends gun education group) will be meeting on Sunday morning at 10 AM at Blue Ridge Arsenal in Chantilly. We welcome ANYONE that wants to learn about guns and get some experience. You do not have to own a gun at all.

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started. We had a several Redditors show up to the events but could accommodate more.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, stance, and safety procedures. You'll learn about different guns and be able to shoot a wide variety of handguns, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.

Look for the Reddit sign to find our group: [Armed Alien](http://i.imgur.com/eFH0O.jpg)
 
Please do your best to not be late! You have to fill out a form to get in and we form up groups before we go in.  If you do come late, just ask to go to the rifle side and look for the alien on my range bag. You'll probably have to pay your fee and fill out some paperwork to gain admittance. If they hassle you, tell them to page the Pink Pistols group and I'll come out and help you get in.

The cost is only $10 if you can get into a group with a range member or $20 if we run out of range members.  If you have safety/sports glasses and/or earplugs/muffs bring them.  If not we can usually provide some or you can rent them.

No one that has come to these events hasn't had a good time and learned something.  Please reply here if you will be coming.

It was also nice to see there are some people here who also feel the same way about traffic towards DC, and the need for a meetup on the opposite side of NOVA.

That being said, two suggestions for a meetup were presented.

* Option 1) Laser Tag.
deaddovedonteat suggested ""Shadowland's in Chantilly and Panther Family Laser Tag's in Sterling."".
I have heard Shadowlands is a bit better as there are multiple floors to compete on.

* Option 2) Pool/Billiards.
[Bungalow Billiards in Chantilly.](http://www.bungalow4u.com/locations.htm#chantilly)
13891 Metrotech Drive, Chantilly, Virginia 20151
Place has daily specials.

Fast Eddies in Fairfax

Finnegan's in Herndon
Has pool tables, and I just checked their events page... has a TRIVIA NIGHT on wens 8PM.

* Option 3
To be discovered? If you have any other ideas please post them and I'll update this thread.

Could we get a vote going here so we can organize something? maybe we can have people vote on the options or suggest a few more. We can setup a few meetups, depending on the feedback, maybe every other week.

Lemme know.

Okay, so I realize this is not the usual forum to post this, but I'm desperate. I work at a bakery. My boss is super awesome, really nice, and fun to work with...except recently. We just opened up our storefront, and things have gotten crazy hectic...so now two (and a halfish) employees plus her are doing the work of like...six people. And she shouldn't be working, she's pregnant. 

So, if you, or pretty much *anyone* that you know, needs a job...PLEASE help me. I am going crazy with this, my boss is so awesome and sweet but now she's so stressed I can barely stand her. 

Job basics: 

* We're really known for our baguettes. You will be making them every day, sometime twice a day. 

* You know those little [clamshell cookies](http://www.donsuemor.com/images/main.jpg) they sell at Starbucks? We provide those to all the Whole Foods in the DC area. You will make these. A lot of them. I hate them, but I was also the sole employee and had to make thousands every day for a few months. Everyone else loves making them. They're easy hours.

* We also make various tartlets, quiches, croissants, pain au chocolat, etc. Bakery stuff, pretty much. You will contribute to those.

* We do not do cakes. If all you want to do is ice cakes, don't bother. We just had some girl show up for one day of work, then quit (via email, an hour after she was supposed to come in) because she just wanted to decorate cakes. 

That's pretty much it. Some experience is nice, but we're *really* liberal about the definition of experience. Like, mine was ""I make bread and stuff at home sometimes."" Seriously. 

All in all, a great job to get ""Bakery!"" on your resume, or to fill some time during Christmas break, or whatever. 

[This is the bakery I work at.](http://www.leonorabakery.com/www.leonorabakery.com/HOME.html) The number on that website is the number to call; say you heard about it through Virginia. It's at the bottom of the page on the ""Order Now!"" tab/page/whatever. No, I'm not just putting it here; I feel like if you're going to apply, you should at least *see* the website. 

So please, please *please* let your friends, strangers, that homeless guy that hangs out on the southern side of Sycamore at Washington know that this job is open. I need relief. 

Thank you! You guys are awesome!

Edit: Whoops! Forgot two things.

* First, the atmosphere. We're laid back, and happy (usually). Don't apply if you can't handle cursing, minor blasphemy, and a lot of gayness. 

* Secondly, we DO have room for a person who wishes to work nights! Yes. Really. We would LOVE someone to work nights.  ",,False,,t5_2riyy,True,,,True,t3_nei8i,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/nei8i/know_any_bakers/,

Hard Times Cafe in Old Town Alexandria is also very very good. When I'm in the neighborhood, we always make time for a bowl of chili there. They also went above and beyond the day after our wedding, letting us take ""engagement"" shots there. Om nom nom.

We welcome ANYONE that wants to learn about guns and get some experience. You do not have to own a gun at all.

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started. All the Redditors that have attended the events in the past have had a great time.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, stance, and safety procedures. You'll learn about different guns and be able to shoot a wide variety of handguns, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.

Look for the Reddit sign to find our group: [Armed Alien](http://i.imgur.com/eFH0O.jpg)
 
**Please do your best to not be late!**  Try to be in the lobby by 9:45am.  We'll put you into a small group prior to entering so we can share lane. If you do come late, just ask to go to the rifle side and look for the alien on my range bag. You'll probably have to pay your fee and fill out some paperwork to gain admittance. If they hassle you, tell them to page the Pink Pistols group and I'll come out and help you get in.

Cost is between $10 and $20 for entry (depending upon the number of range members in attendance).  If you don't bring a gun of your own please bring $10 for a pool to cover ammo costs of those that bring guns for your to shoot.

I've lived in VA all my life, and in NoVA for the last 15 years or so.  Recently my friends and I moved into a Townhouse in Centreville just off 28 and we're looking for places to go out and meet people.  We've been pretty shut-in since we moved in due to a lack of time/effort and we're aiming to change that.  Last Friday we went to Fast Eddies on 29, but it seemed pretty empty for a Friday, with no one but us playing pool and only a few people drinking upstairs.

Does anyone have any cool bars/venues/groups/whatever where a couple of somewhat nerdy 24ish guys and gals could hang out on a Friday night?

Thanks!

Edit:  Thanks for the kickass suggestions everyone, I have a list of places to show my roommates for this week and now we'll know where to go and where to avoid in the future.",,False,,t5_2riyy,True,,,True,t3_pwne9,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/pwne9/good_hangouts_for_20somethings_in/,

Out of the three people I emailed (senator Warner, Webb, &amp; congressman Moran), Moran was the only one who sent a reply specifically addressing SOPA. The Senators only sent generic emails with no mention of SOPA. Below is the reply (received today)

Dear Friend:

In light of your concern regarding the “Stop Online Piracy Act” (SOPA) (H.R. 3261), I thought you might be interested in some of the most recent developments pertaining to the legislation and its Senate counterpart, the “Protect IP Act” (PIPA), S. 968. 

As you know, H.R. 3261 was drafted in order to protect intellectual property and fight copyright infringement by deterring the sale of counterfeit goods on mainly foreign websites. While I believe that we need to pass legislation to prevent the illegal sale and purchase of intellectual property and strengthen existing copyright law, it is clear that SOPA is not the right bill to achieve this goal. 

SOPA would authorize the Justice Department (DOJ) to sue a domain or website that “engages in, enables, or facilitates copyright infringement” and it would give the Attorney General authority to seek financial restitution from those sites. This could include websites that host illegal mp3s or websites that provide links to them. The bill would also hold host websites accountable for illegal content; allowing the government to order third parties, such as payment processors like PayPal and online ad networks to cut ties with said sites. SOPA would also permit regulators to require Internet service providers to block access to offending sites entirely. 

I have deep concerns with this bill. The broad nature of the language would grant unprecedented authority to the DOJ and could result in regulations that would censor websites and stifle free speech and the innovative spirit that the Internet has been built on. We need to craft and support legislation that strengthens intellectual property rights without compromising the open nature of the Internet. 

On Thursday, December 15th, 2011, the House Judiciary Committee held a marathon mark-up session of SOPA. The heated mark-up provided Members the opportunity to offer amendments which would have made improvements to the bill, but all were defeated. 

The Senate version of the bill, PIPA was expected to see floor action on January 24, 2012. In response to the impending Senate vote and forecasted House action, many websites launched highly successful grassroots campaigns urging users to contact their Representatives and voice their opposition to SOPA and PIPA. In a symbolic move, a number of websites, including Wikipedia and Firefox, held a “blackout” day on Wednesday, January 18, 2012, in which they blocked access to content on their sites to reinforce the possible negative impacts of these bills. Since the “blackout” day, consideration of both bills has been delayed. 

I supported these efforts and encourage your future participation in this political discourse. It is through your participation and activism that more attention was given to these bills and I look forward to working with you and my colleagues in crafting a more thoughtful piece of legislation that balances the need to protect intellectual property while preserving Internet freedom. 

Thank you again for contacting me. 

Sincerely,
James P. Moran",,False,,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,t3_ow67p,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/ow67p/congressman_jim_morans_response_to_sopapipa_email/,

This was initially limited to the young folks, but I am now opening it to all.

Thanks to JBass for organizing all of this.

12:00 - 12:30 
Chillin' at the fountain, waiting for everyone to awkwardly ask if we're the Reddit Group

12:30 - 3:00/4:00 
Walking around, going into stores, hanging out in the grassy area. If you want you can bring some board games or a Frisbee. The parking area and you can always put away your toys when you need to. 

3:00/4:00 - 4:00/5:00 
Eat at a restaurant! People are leaning towards Mexican food, but I recommend getting something small from Panera. 

4:00/5:00 - 7:30 
If we've hit up everything by this point (or if it is raining) we may go watch a movie. 

7:30 and later 
The Mo' Soul Concert will start at 7:00 and we can hang out around the area for a while. After/during the concert, those of us that want to hit up a second restaurant for Dinner can do so. If we decide to hit up a bar, lets pick a place that allows under 21s


**Note: We will be meeting up at the fountain at noon. We'll probably wait around for about 30 minutes for everyone to get there and then move around the area.",,False,,t5_2riyy,True,,,True,t3_iw3u3,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/iw3u3/nova_reddit_meetup_august_20th_official/,

* Woodbridge - **edit: Possible Potomac Nationals Game**

Newly Added:

* Sterling - **Dinner + Activity**

What I need from you:

* 1 to 4 Co-hosts per location
* Ideas from all of you for things to do
* At least 10 requests from people if they want to host a meetup at a different location like Gainesville or Sterling

Rules:

* The co-hosts will decide on the meetups being E for everyone, M for mature, or D for drinking
* I would rather not go for D. Activities or even just dinner would be nice
* I am not responsible for transportation as I doubt I will make it to all of them
* At least one co-host should plan on making one more meetup later, to keep up a local community meetups. 
* Everyone should have fun or at least enjoy themselves!",,False,,t5_2riyy,1343310515.0,,,True,t3_x5eul,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/x5eul/sreial_meetups_around_nova/,moderator

You do not, DO NOT, pull on peoples' car doors at dark o'clock. On a Saturday. Unsolicited. In a Metro parking lot. In Virginia, where laws on armed self-defense are much less strict than DC's. Much less when the car's owner is behind the wheel. The fuck am I supposed to think, that you're some kind of backpacking carjacker or something?  Pulling on car doors in DC may work to get you lifts from the Metro back to your dorm.  I don't know, I didn't go to school in the area.  But pulling this shit in Virginia is a good way to get yourself shot.  

You seemed like a nice enough fellow, stupidity aside. I apologize that I wasn't going in your direction.

We would like to invite Redditors to our event again as it has been a good time with prior get-togethers. All the Redditors that have attended the events in the past have had a great time. We welcome ANYONE that wants to learn about guns and get some experience. You do not have to own a gun at all.

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, stance, and safety procedures. You'll learn about different guns and be able to shoot a wide variety of handguns, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang. Look for the Reddit sign to find our group: [Armed Alien](http://i.imgur.com/eFH0O.jpg)

**Please do your best to not be late!** Try to be in the lobby by 9:45am. We'll put you into a small group prior to entering so we can share lanes. If you do come late, just ask to go to the rifle side and look for the alien on my range bag. You'll probably have to pay your fee and fill out some paperwork to gain admittance. If they hassle you, tell them to page the Pink Pistols group and I'll come out and help you get in.

Cost is between $10 and $20 for entry (depending upon the number of range members in attendance). If you don't bring a gun of your own please bring $10 (in small bills if possible) for a pool to cover ammo costs of those that bring the guns you'll be shooting.",,False,,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,t3_12gh8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/12gh8z/reddit_pink_pistols_meetup_learn_to_shoot_a_gun/,

I go to the Blue Ridge Arsenal in Chantilly with the Pink Pistols group once a month on Sunday mornings at 10AM.  It's a laid back group, often with people that don't own firearms at all.  You can learn about guns and shoot a bunch of different types.  We usually stay for an hour or so.

Pink Pistols is a gay-friendly group but the leader is a libertarian not actually gay.  Last event I went to the straight people outnumbered the LGBT folks.  It's not usually a big group but we'd like more people to come join us.  All are welcome and we never talk about personal stuff.  We are just there to have fun, learn about firearms, and practice.  

Experienced shooters are welcome too.  Please bring your interesting guns and some smaller (easy to shoot) guns if you have them. Handguns, rifles, and shotguns are allowed but you have to use jacketed ammo.

Cost is usually $10 but could be $20 for the hour if you can't share a lane with a range member.  Bring eye protection (normal plastic lens glasses are good) if you can.  We can share ear protection with you.  I can transport you from the Leesburg area if you need a ride.

Do gun ranges cater to people like me?  

If I'm going to have to sign up for like a daylong class and spend like $100 then never mind...  I'm not that curious.  Mostly I'm just bored out of my mind in Loudoun.

People who own guns are SO into them... but I just don't get it.  They always tell me OH you have to actually shoot one before you understand the appeal.  So naturally I'm curious and don't have shit to do for the next two days.  I'm up late and was brainstorming and for some reason I thought ""Oh, maybe I could find out what it's like too shoot a gun... it's probably complicated though.  Ugh, and I might have to take a class.  Meh I'll probably just stay on reddit the whole time instead.""

TL;DR - Loudoun county is more dull than Eastern Colorado and I'm trying to think of new/interesting things to do.  I've never shot a gun before and Loudoun seems to be full of 2nd amendment whackos.

House is about 5 min by car to metro.  I usually take the bus which takes you to Pentagon City metro in about 7min.

A little bit about us: Greg works in IT for a contractor in Arlington. He enjoys having a beer (or five) with our neighbors and catching radioactive mud flounder on company retreats. Eric, my other roommate, owns a startup neuroscience company and I used to work for him. He's a Buddhist and a sage who collects cacti for our deck among other pursuits. My name's Ian and I work for a contractor in Crystal City, which incidentally is the reason I'm renting out the room since I'll be leaving to work in Afghanistan for a year. 

Our neighbors are awesome and we're close with all of them. They're all late 20s - 30 and we all regularly enjoys going to vineyards, beerfests, etc. together, as well as just hanging out around our communal fire pit or pool.

This was brought to my attention by my dog daycare place and I thought I would share with anyone who was willing to help out. There has been a huge influx of 35 puppies in the past week, and this shelter is more than overrun and could use a lot of help.  **This is urgent, as Friday may be their last day before they are put down.**  Fostering is temporary / medium term (need at least a 4 week commitment). The organization provides all the supplies you need for that time, and will advertise to hopefully find a permanent home. For more information here is the rescue organization you can contact:

Edit: [The adoption list.](http://www.homewardtrails.org/adopt-a-pet/dogs-for-adoption) Thanks ipeeoncats (an obvious dog person ;) ).

Also feel free to x-post to any subreddit you think might be interested. Thanks.

**Update:** According to etothex, all the puppies have been fostered at this time (12:40pm, 03/29/2011). Thanks to everyone who passed the word around, but don't forget there are always agencies and shelters that need foster parents, so if this piqued your interest, you can still follow through and be a foster!",,False,,t5_2riyy,True,,,True,t3_rilcn,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/rilcn/can_you_help_to_foster_or_adopt_a_puppy_this_is/,

It is a quiet and safe neighborhood full of old people and us ""whipper-snappers"".  


Very close to Vienna Metro, Fair Oaks Mall and insanely easy commute to and from Sterling/Ashburn/Reston/Herndon.  I work in Sterling and it takes me 20 minutes each way.  

$650/month + utilities.  We have motherfuckin' FiOS.  And electricity.

Must be gay, dog and kid friendly.  We think the dog is gay.  My son is 6 and we request that you do not spit or stare at him. 

Bonus features include: 

* Free car mechanic (me)

* Free IT services (me)

* XBox/PS3/PC gaming (me and the dog) 

* Random Korean BBQ nights.

* I'll personally buy you a year of Reddit Gold if you move in.  6 months if you can refer someone that doesn't turn out to be Patrick Bateman or Rick Santorum. 

* Neil deGrasse Tyson, Ron Paul and/or Louis CK may or may not visit at any time. 

A fellow Redditor and [/r/NOVA](/r/NOVA) mod, [CoolJBAD](http://www.reddit.com/user/CoolJBAD) can vouch for the house and me.  


PM or comment for further details.  PM if you are super serial about this once in a lifetime opportunity. 


**[Edit]** Due to popular demand here is some more info:

*  Utilities are split 4 ways.  Averages $80~$100/month.  Summer is more expensive with the AC.  To save electricity we go to the neighbors house and BS there all day using their AC not ours.  They are old people so we tell them that we are their children.  We get sweet tea and old birthday cards.

*  Room is ~14x16.  I  tried to measure it, but roommate did not appreciate me doing it @ 3AM while he slept.  Glad he's leaving... It has it's own closet with adjustable shelves.  There is a lot of storage space in the basement.  

* igotfiveonit reminded me that there is a Costco and Wegmans minutes away.  We have a community Costco card so if you don't have one, worry not.  There is also a Bone Fish Grill behind the house.  I will buy you not 1 but 2 Bang Bang Shrimps for moving in.  


**[edit 2]**  Someone PM'ed me and said that my username didn't paint a good picture and that no wonder one of my roommates is moving out.  

We consider ourselves the chillest bunch around.  Here is a prime example: [our holiday card we mailed out for 2011](http://imgur.com/hKqdH).  I'm the one on the right.

Tomorrow I post on CL and I will not spam again.
 
I'm looking to sublease my [basement](http://maps.google.com/maps/myplaces?ll=38.884003,-77.252918&amp;spn=0.013997,0.01929&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=23.875,57.630033&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ctz=240&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A) come October 1st. I was looking for not only a housemate, but someone with whom I might be able to geek out, share a beer on friday night, but also still wants their own space. I figured Reddit would be the place to look first, and I cleared it through the admins, just to be sure I wasn't turning this into Craigslist.  *shudder* 
  
  
**A little about me:** I'm 35f, system admin for a private school, single mom of an awesome [13y](http://www.reddit.com/user/Sparky678348) and 11y. I love to cook, and almost got my degree in culinary arts before I got bored and went for my CCNA. I'm a liberal who is also a former Marine; I was voted 'Mollie Marine' of my boot camp platoon. I have recently fallen in love with Game of Thrones, although Firefly still holds a strong second. Ents are embraced, stoners are not. 
  
  
**The good:** $900 a month including utilities; 25M wifi, but NO TV. If you want to add it, that's totally cool if you pay the difference, but I stream my media server (which you're welcome to) and Hulu via my Wii.    
  
The basement is fairly large: it has a large living space, a bedroom, and a kitchen-thingie. I say thingie because although there is a full-size fridge, a microwave, and cabinets down there, there is no oven or stove. You would of course have full use of all common areas upstairs including the kitchen, so a late night pizza fix is no problem. Sharing is completely optional, although completely encouraged.  
  
There is a little shower area built into the washroom, nothing fancy, but it's there if you don't feel like going upstairs to the full bath you will share with the kids. They're not filthy animals, I promise. No throne yet, but I may be putting in an upflush system soon.  
  
It's partially furnished, if you need. I have a black leather living room set and a bookcase down there, and an extra futon if you need it. Possibly more, depending on what my current housemate leaves. I also have linens and pillows and pots and pans, and vacuums and a TVs you're welcome to use.   
  
There is a separate entrance around back, and I'm jealous that your door opens up into the tail end of Southside Park. It's great for having BBQs (which I do regularly!) and just for chilling out and watching the deer and fox that wander through.  
  
Location is awesome. We're about a mile and a half from the Vienna Metro, Tyson's is right up the street, you can sneak through the backroads to Downtown Vienna, and the schools fucking rock. My son's middle school is one of the best public schools in the nation.   
  
**The bad:** 

The big one: at least the last 10 years this place has been lived in, there have been cats. I also have 2 indoor cats, so if you are allergic or don't like cats, this might be a dealbreaker.  If you DO have cats, there is a removable cat door built into the window. 

The place is a little old, and doors have been known to come out of their grooves, but I'm pretty handy and the lady who owns it is great about fixing big things as they break. 

The floors are paper thin, and although I don't care what you do down there, we might giggle about it up here. 

The traffic sucks balls, and not in a good way. Since we're so close to the metro, 495 AND 66, it flat out sucks at rush hour. There are ways to get around, but you're screwed if you take 66.   
  
If you're interested, send me a PM, and we'll go from there!

[pics](http://maulie.imgur.com/basement_rental#7BBQt) Yes, the place is a mess, but squint and pretend you can see it empty.

 We got a few estimates and we were given anywhere between 5k and 6k. Yah… Not gonna happen!

**What Happened and Lessons Learned**

•	We did it ourselves     
We actually got some people to help with the digging and a plumber to do the connections
It was a lot more stressful but cost a LOT less (saved about 4500)

•	Plan        
You'll probably want to plan it out before starting, we failed to do this and wasted a lot of time running around trying to find supplies/tools.

Make sure you get a permit before starting and of course always call 811 like others have pointed out.

•	New line or fix the old?      
We decided to connect a new one. Especially considering the old line was made of these blue pipes (can’t remember its name) that are banned and no longer in use

•	Copper, PVC, or Pex?       
We decided to go with copper since we couldn't find the correct PVC/PEX seamless (rolls) pipes, only irrigation or for indoors use only. This was a point of many disagreements since where ever we went and asked they would say, ""BAH! Copper will corrode"" or ""BAH plastic pipes will pop."" But, since we could only find copper we went with that.

•	The plumber      
After all the digging, hole drilled in the foundation to insert pipes, we got the plumber. He was of great help. We didn’t have the tools or his experience with brazing copper. He saved us a lot of time and angst. 

We learned a LOT from this 'experience'. If you have any questions, fire away!

I had already paid a deposit when I got a letter about a week and a half ago telling me about my deposit and why I was going to have to pay it.

I wouldn't have been very perturbed at the general idea of having to pay a deposit, as I'm 23 years old without much rental/utility history. Except...the stated reason was a credit score in the mid-500's, which I knew couldn't be right unless I'd gotten dinged by a bunch of credit inquiries from my recent move.

When I called up about this, they rolled over pretty quickly about sending me a refund, which further reinforced my suspicion that this was ""let's charge a bunch of deposits and see if we come out ahead."" Furthermore I got the credit report I was entitled to from Experian from this (and Experian is apparently the credit agency they use to determine who needs to pay a deposit and who doesn't) and that had me at a much more respectable score, which makes sense given that I've always payed my credit card in full, on time, etc etc. But...it didn't do anything to explain where Dominion got such a low score for me from. Again, the only reason I was expecting a legitimate bad score was a flood of inquiries from my move, but that wasn't the case.

**tl;dr** Dominion seems to use credit scores pulled directly out of their ass when assessing who has to pay a deposit, so it's worth checking into if they did this to you.",,False,,t5_2riyy,1341977073.0,,,True,t3_wd2vl,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/wd2vl/just_a_heads_up_if_youve_had_to_pay_a_deposit_to/,

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby.  If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started.  We had a couple Redditors show up last time but could accommodate more.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, stance, and safety procedures.  You'll learn about different guns and be able to shoot a wide variety of handguns, rifles, and maybe even shotguns.

While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics.  It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that.  It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.

Do you know what it is? If yes, good for you, and if not, [here is a video of popular YouTube video game review/content producer TotalBiscuit explaining quite well the ramifications of SOPA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhwuXNv8fJM). 

So, now we know what SOPA could do, we also get to see that those congressmen debating the bill don't even understand what's going on! But what do we do about it? Participate in the government, of course.

The reason I'm making this thread in the NoVA subreddit is to post information about your current congressman, making it easier for you to contact him about SOPA. (Of course, if you're for SOPA, it's completely fine for you to talk to your congressman/woman and let him know that you support it). I feel a main reason people don't just email/call in about pieces of legislation is that they don't know how, and feel that it wouldn't be worth the time to find out how or to do it. 

Well, for those of you in the 10th district, [from roughly western Loudoun to Reston and down south past Chantilly](http://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep?ZIP=20165) your representative is Frank Wolf. Frank Wolf has 3 offices, all the information you need to get to the offices/contact them [can be found here](http://wolf.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=164&amp;sectiontree=2,164). For convenince: the three offices are the Washington Office (phone: 220-225-5136), Herndon Office (phone: 703-709-5800), and the Winchester Office (phone: 540-667-0990). For full information including the address, directions, and fax numbers, click the link provided above. 

If you would prefer to e-Mail instead of call, [you have to go here](http://wolf.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=383) and input your 5 digit postal code with your extra 4 digit (I believe route number) at the end. If you don't know your full 4 digit code it can be found by inputting your address [at this site](https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction!input.action). This will allow you to send and e-Mail to the office of Frank Wolf. 

But your representative isn't Frank Wolf? Fair enough, NoVa spans more than just the 10th Congressional District. To find out who your representative is, got o [www.house.gov](http://www.house.gov/) and input your zip code in the top right. This will take you to a link that shows your district, and your current representative. Simply click on the representative's name and it should take to you their page, wherein you can find contact details.

If you haven't already, I urge you to follow these steps in order to make yourself heard. If enough people contact the office, it will make a difference. Feel free to link to this on your facebook and such, the more the merrier.

We've hidden virtual prizes ($100 gift cards, restaurant vouchers, etc.) all around DC at some of these locations. The X-number (it's random) person to replicate the photo at a jackpot site wins the prize. It is FREE to play and you can register here: [DCPhotoCache.com](http://www.dcphotocache.com).

You get to explore some neat sites in DC on your own time/pace, while still having the chance to uncover some awesome virtual prizes. Visit as many or few sites as you want, and buy power-ups along the way (to help you narrow down the location of the treasure)!


I would love any feedback you had on the idea. Also, if you could help us spread the word about the event by inviting your friends, I would love you forever.

Perhaps it was the first day of summer that my cat decided to roam the streets of our neighborhood, delighting in the warmth of a late June evening, but she's been missing since the night of June 22nd and I'm a bit worried.

Sure, she can take care of herself. Cats are like little survival ninjas, right? And yes, she is known to be gone for a couple days when summer rolls around... But I'm worried. The family is worried. We just want to cover the bases, so to speak, and Reddit seemed like a good base to cover. (We've already called the Animal Shelter off of Eisenhower Ave and created a Craigslist page.)

My cat's name is Lilli. She is a [Bombay](http://www.breeding-cats.com/image-files/fotolia_1074679_xs.jpg), with amber eyes and some white hairs sporadically placed on her fur (she's 11 now, but acts like a kitten). She has all of her claws, spayed, and has had her lower left canine pulled. She's a tough cookie, but is friendly in an aloof sort of way. She has a distinct sort of voice, and is very vocal.

1366479624.0,16,self.nova,1cr1yd,Disappointed with Clarendon Ballroom.,Navihawk11,33,17,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1cr1yd/disappointed_with_clarendon_ballroom/,"UPDATE #2:  Today, Monday 4/22/13 I received a call from Ed of LN Securities, the company that handles security for the Ballroom and Spider Kelly's, among others.  Ed had me tell my story again and then informed me that he had reviewed the video tapes and claims that he saw a man in a grey suit with a teal shirt (he was unsure since it was black and white tape - I was in a blue shirt) enter the bathroom and then leave the bathroom, proceed under a rope into the employees only area and pull on several locked doors then get confronted by staff.  After being confronted by staff the individual immediately went upstairs.  To say that this was news to me would be an understatement.  He also informed me that the doors this person was attempting to open were where they store the liqueur at the Ballroom. So he has now basically accused me of trying to steal liqueur from the Ballroom.  Since I know this is not true and very clearly either a fabrication or someone else in a grey suit I immediately ask to come down to the Ballroom to see the tapes.  This is where he informs me that the tapes had either already been taped over or were no longer working, very convenient that this happened right after he viewed them.  He also informed me that AJ was the senior security guy on duty that night, not a manager.  AJ also claimed that I was very polite until the end when I called him a ""douche"" and walked away.  Which is also news to me.  
Now, after accusing me of trying to steal from the establishment and treating his employee rudely he offers to waive the cover charge and make sure my first round is free next time I visit the ballroom.  This now has me legitimately confused, within the space of a twenty minute phone call he says he **had** proof of me trying to either steal or go somewhere I was not supposed to go and then offers to let me back in for free.  
The whole things seems even fishier than before.


UPDATE #1:  I spoke with Nick of the Ballroom this morning over the phone.  He was very polite and offered to look into what happened.  Apparently AJ was not the manager that night and so he is confused as to what actually happened as well and he is going to find to what happened.  He also offered to have me and my friends back as his guests and would take care of us that evening.  So it seems that something very strange happened with the security staff that evening and Nick apologized profusely and offered to make it right.  

Last evening, 4/19/2013 I went out to the Clarendon Ballroom with a group of friends.  As I was coming straight from work I was easily well dressed enough for the Ballroom’s rather lax dress code.  We entered, paid the cover, got our reentry stamps and went to the bar.  After about two beers I excused myself and went to the restroom downstairs and then stepped outside for a smoke.  It was still relatively early, about 10:30 as the DJ had only been playing for about a half hour.  I stood outside in the rain, had my smoke and then went to go back inside.  
This is where the fun began.  When I tried to get back inside the bouncer informed me that there was no reentry that evening.  This seemed strange to me as the Ballroom has always let people out to smoke and come back in, but as I was the only one outside at that time it made sense.  At this point, of course my phone had died so I took a cab back to my car, which was parked in Shirlington.  I plugged it in and waited for it to charge.  As it charged I drove back to Ballston as at this point my friends inside had no idea where I was.  As I drove past the Ballroom I saw them outside smoking and thought “Aha! They will not be able to reenter either and we can then go somewhere else.”  
After I parked I walked up to the Ballroom and my friends were not out front, and had sent numerous texts asking where I was.  At this point in the evening there was a good crowd of smokers outside and they were filtering in back and forth.  I walked up to the bouncer to show him my ID again as there was only two people in line waiting to pay the cover.  He immediately became irate and said something to the effect of “I already kicked you out once this evening.”  This revelation was news to me.  I immediately asked to speak to a manager.  The bouncer got on the radio and called him over.
The manager, named AJ, came over and stepped outside to talk to me.  I asked his name shook his hand and he asked how he could help me.  I explained the situation and asked why I was “kicked out” from the ballroom.  At this point he had been talking to me for a few minutes and could see that I was calm and obviously not drunk.  He stated that staff had kicked me out and that I could “try us again another evening.”  I asked which staff had kicked me out and he responded with a terse “Staff.”  He then simply walked away.  
Needless to say at this point I was perplexed.  I kept my cool and waited for my friends to come out to have another smoke.  When they did I explained the situation and they asked the bouncer why I was not allowed back in and he stated that he did not know and that he was simply following orders.  
I am very confused as to exactly what happened last evening.
Was there anything I could have done to make this situation better?  I realize that once they make the decision to kick you out you are not getting back in, but there was no apology or explanation.  The whole thing seemed arbitrary and random. 

 TLDR ~ A non-violent, sober, well dressed, paying customer was denied readmission to the Ballroom after smoking outside and was never given a reason as to why his reentry was denied.

Now I really hate to get down on someone who's doing their job, but the last five years or so have really been a spate of huge misses on weather forecasts. Most notably I think we've been predicted to get a total of 120"" of snow and gotten 18"". At least that's what it seems like. 

And I have this sneaking suspicion that the ""snow models"" are simply broken for large storms in this area.

With my job I cannot leave early on Mondays to pick him up or have someone take and watch him until I get off of work.  So far, I am enrolling him in the Early Morning program, so that I can drop him off early and get to work early to leave at 3:30 to pick him up at the bus stop on normal days.  Mondays just seem to be impossible.  All of my work colleagues' wives w/ kids don't work (must be nice) and have no problems.  Or they live in Loudon and don't have 1/2 day Mondays.

I find it infuriating on many levels about 1/2 day Mondays.  I see no point to it and seems like like a way to have teachers do ""planning"" and what not (teachers please correct me here).  Kids get less time to learn is my main concern.  I also see this as a huge burden where both parents have to work or like in my case, single parent.

I can think of a few bands off the top of my head that would love to get a gig in even someones house.. but we would need a lot of people to make it worth their while. 
it would be cool to have it reddit-inspired (i.e. reddit core group/redditors house and redditor bands), but we'd probably need to expand it to our general friend base as well.
I haven't been able to make any nova meetups yet, but would our crowd be receptive to a show like this?


we've done a lot of daylight meetups, let's do some night stuff yeah?

**edit:** keep in mind I haven't spoken to any of the bands yet, but knowing that they'd like to get a gig I was thinking: 
**[Sinatra](https://www.facebook.com/SinatraMusic)**

**[Shat Shorts](http://shatshorts.bandcamp.com/)**

**[I Kill Giants](https://www.facebook.com/pages/I-Kill-Giants/149981718396618?sk=app_204974879526524)**

and if I could get some guys to come up from harrisonburg:

**[Akris](http://www.myspace.com/akrisband)**

**[elephant child](http://www.reverbnation.com/elephantchild)**

and of course any bands you all know; what matters is that we have an actively interested fan base that *wants* this show. if we had enough people/interest we could make the bands follow. if you build it (the show) they will come (the bands).

I can't do this alone, i need your help in getting:

1) a house, firstly

2) word out to your friends so we have enough people show up

3) any redditor bands you may know personally - i'll contact the bands but it'd be better to have someone with a connection get in touch ",,False,,t5_2riyy,True,,,True,t3_pcu8z,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/pcu8z/proposing_a_basement_show_with_local_bands/,

Official press release below.

Pro-Choice Activists Call Cuccinelli’s Bluff: Save Abortion Clinics or Lose Hospitals

An activist working with Oppose TRAP has submitted a petition calling into question the legality of the current regulations of most Virginia hospitals. Taking Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli at his word, the petition points out the unintended consequences of his position on grandfathering for women’s health centers that provide abortion care, which under 2011 legislation are now defined as hospitals.

In 2011 the Virginia General Assembly passed SB924, defining health care facilities that perform first-trimester abortions as hospitals, requiring they be regulated by the Board of Health. Despite a panel of medical experts’ recommendation to grandfather in existing facilities2, the regulations as written by Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s office required clinics to undergo extremely costly structural upgrades to parking spaces, hallways widths, awnings, etc. These medically unnecessary requirements come from three chapters of a manual called the 2010 Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities, and are unrelated to women’s health and safety.

These regulations were expected to permanently close the doors of at least 75% of the abortion clinics in the state.1 After public protest and outspoken opposition from the medical community made clear the dire consequences of Ken Cuccinelli’s position, the Board passed an amendment that would exempt existing clinics from having to meet the new building codes.

In response, Cuccinelli opined that the Board of Health did not have the authority to grandfather existing clinics. He threatened to withhold future legal counsel from the Board, directing it to pass the regulations as originally written.

The Board of Health capitulated, effectively sentencing the closure of most abortion clinics in the state.

The facility guidelines for hospital construction clearly state they are “intended as minimum standards for designing and constructing new health care facility projects.” When it was pointed out that these are not new facilities, and in some cases have been in safe operation for decades, the Attorney General's Office declared that they were new hospitals because the 2011 legislation newly defined them as hospitals.

Since that time, reproductive rights activist Molly Taylor Vick researched the legislation which originally defined general hospitals in 1947, just as SB924 defined abortion clinics as hospitals in 2011. After further investigation she discovered the first Rules and Regulations Governing Licensure of General Hospitals in an unprocessed box of files at an off-site archive of the Library of Virginia; these regulations did grandfather in existing hospitals without requiring them to meet the same standards as newly constructed facilities.

Now, with clinics already closing3 and only a year remaining until some must come into compliance, Molly Taylor Vick has filed a petition that challenges Ken Cuccinelli to defend the legality of his position. This may provoke concern in some reproductive rights advocates, who could feel uncomfortable being associated with a legal process that has the potential to shut down health care facilities. They cannot afford to alienate their allies in the medical community.

Oppose TRAP appreciates these concerns. “Access to health care is something we all value very highly, but this is really about whether people believe in equal application of the law. One argument of pro-choice activists has been that abortion clinics cannot be regulated differently than other facilities; that the law must be applied equally. That is exactly what we’re saying. We are merely pointing out the implications of a decision made by Cuccinelli.” Oppose TRAP continues to explain that after due diligence, they also feel confident that the economic, political and social consequences are so severe that there is not a real threat to general hospitals. “That is the whole point. It is absurd. Cuccinelli needs to explain how it isn’t or own up to what he has done.”

Molly Taylor Vick notes that participation in the public comment period does not equal support for the petition. “People are encouraged to use their voices to express their individual concerns, whether they are in support of or strong opposition to the petitions.”

She further contends that this is taking the fight to where Ken Cuccinelli pretends it is - in the legal interpretation and application of law. “He must own this.”

Cuccinelli can not selectively apply the law:

If existing hospitals CANNOT be grandfathered in under new regulations, this brings into question the legal status of every facility built prior to 2005, many of which will now be forced to undergo the same costly architectural renovations as abortion clinics. This could result in hospitals across the state closing their doors.

If existing hospitals CAN be legally grandfathered as they always have been, then they CAN be legally grandfathered today, and Cuccinelli overstepped his legal and professional authority by refusing to certify those approved regulations. He also overstepped ethical boundaries by threatening to withhold representation if the Board of Health was sued.

VDH must either act to amend hospital regulations to require current construction code of existing facilities or readdress the issue of grandfathering as applied to abortion clinic facilities.

**Are you a level headed, intelligent person looking for a place to live in the Sterling area? Here's the deal. **

**My current roommate and I want to move into a sweet townhouse we found, but we need a third person to help with the rent. That's where you come in. For your $700, you get:**

A sweet room on the third story. Never worry about flood damage again!

Generous closet space! You may feel compelled to buy more clothes to fill it all.

A bathroom! You're going to have to share it with one person, unless you assume the master bedroom (for $800).

Super lickity-speed internet!

Full access to the house common areas, including two living rooms, a kitchen / dining room, a deck, and a patio! 
Fire up the grill.

Central Air! No pleasure, no rapture, no exquisite sin greater... than central air.

Gas powered heating, dryer, and stove. Now you're cooking with gas!

Half of a single car garage. Bring your motorcycle, you speed demon!


**About us:** We are two guys in our early 20's. We are both degree holding college graduates. One of us is an outdoor adventure specialist, so if you like hiking, camping, you know, outdoors stuff, we're right there with you. The other is a network engineer, so don't worry about the internet going down, that shit is covered! We're helpful, easy-going and laid back, so if you have a problem with us or our habits, come and tell us you turkey!


**About you:** Not gonna lie, we have no idea what you're like. Fortunately for you, we don't care about your race, age, religion (don't try converting us though!), gender, orientation, profession, relationship status, etc. 

Here is what we do care about:

We don't smoke. We are hesitant to live with a smoker, because we've all played Left 4 Dead, and because we don't like smelling ash all the time.

We don't do drugs. Our job testing requirements mandate that, and we're not really looking for somebody with a stash.

We are not heavy partiers. We come home to rest and relax, not to rave. That said, there is a fridge in the garage that will hopefully have alcohol in it 24/7.

We are not pet people, one is allergic to cats, the other just heavily dislikes dogs. Fish are ok though.


That about covers it all. I'd post pictures, but we don't move in until this weekend. Trust me when I say that this place is sweet. ",,False,,t5_2riyy,True,,,True,t3_jz3ok,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/jz3ok/not_sure_if_this_is_the_right_place_for_this_but/,

Please meet Mikan (Mikki for short): http://imgur.com/a/cIFiR
https://www.dropbox.com/s/tz87fqv7yousr33/VIDEO0401_1.mp4 (video of him playing!) 

Mikan is a 4 year old Orange Tabby that we have had since he was a kitten. My family is moving to the UK for school and work, and unfortunately we can't take him with us (partially due to the regulations involved with moving a cat there). We originally had a family member interested in adopting him, but they are unable to take him in.

Mikan is really sweet and a bit shy. He enjoys hunting bugs outside of the window and taking long cat naps. He particularly loves being rubbed anywhere on his head. In the mornings he likes to come into the bedroom ""make biscuits"" (kneading) on a pillow.

He really loves being rubbed; he will often come up to us and our visitors to ask for a head rub.

Mikan is neutered and microchipped, and will be up-to-date on his check up and shots and when adopted.

Please let me know if you happen to know anyone who can give Mikan a good home!",,False,,t5_2riyy,1376280223.0,,,True,t3_1k1lmh,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1k1lmh/need_to_rehome_a_cat_sorry_for_the_repost/,

Google Maps suggests two routes: I-81 and US-29. 29 is shorter but seems to have more traffic lights. 81 seems like a smoother way to go but not sure if the extra distance is worth it.
