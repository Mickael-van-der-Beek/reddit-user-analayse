1343863059.0,111,self.mac,xj74v,A whole bunch of useful features in OS X which many new to Mac users don't know about,SexWithTwins,129,18,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/xj74v/a_whole_bunch_of_useful_features_in_os_x_which/,"A user from /r/OSX was asking about keyboard shortcuts and how to assign them manually.  I got to thinking about how many people there are out there who, unlike me, haven't been using Apple's Mac Operating System of one flavour or another since the mid-1990's, and how useful it might be for them to learn some of the functions built into OS X which have been around for a long time, despite being somewhat hidden from view and only really known to us old dogs who started out with a Quadra.

So I wrote this list of keyboard shortcuts and system tweaking tips.  It's far from exhaustive, but most of them revolve around the sort of usability and functionality we Mac users are always going on about, which new users sometimes find hard to dig out for themselves.  The Mac is, after all, quite different to Windows.  

I also hope there's one or two tips in there which long time users might not already know about, but if you think you might have one which I've missed, maybe we could eventually compile some sort of go-to guide which we could link to whenever someone asks for help with something which has already been asked before.

I've pasted the entire article as a comment, due to Reddit's restrictions on how long text only posts can be.

It would not recognize the hard drive. So I took it into my local Apple store to have it repaired, and they told me it would be $160.00 to replace the hard drive with a new 500 GB drive. I thought this was a smoking good deal, since I've had this iMac since the summer of 2007, and it still ran fine.Well, except for the broken drive. A few days went by, and they called and told me that the repair tech accidentally damaged the control-board (motherboard) and they ordered a new one. I was not upset, because not only was I getting a larger hard drive for $160.00, but it also looked I would be getting a new board. Not a bad price to keep a 5 year old machine running. Well a week goes by, and I get another call from the Apple store. This time they tell me that the new board was defective, and they would be unable to repair my iMac. At first I was a little devastated, but the gentleman Apple employee told me to give him an hour and he'll have my brand new iMac ready. I showed up at the store an hour later, and he handed me a brand new 21.5-inch, mid 2011. It was with the 2.7 GHz Core i5 chip, AMD Radeon HD 6770M 512 MB, and 1 TB hard drive. So instead of spending $160.00 for a new hard drive, I spent $185.00 for a new Apple Care. I don't know of another company that would replace a 5 year old product with a brand new one. Simply amazing.

1361209218.0,72,self.mac,18re5z,Run Windows 8 off USB on your Mac,phiber232,80,8,19,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/18re5z/run_windows_8_off_usb_on_your_mac/,"I just got Windows 8 to go working on my mid 2012 Mac Book Air. Like many people with this laptop I have a puny 128GB SSD and don't want to waste space for Windows when I only need it from time to time. It's not easy but with a little time you can install Windows 8 to USB and run it from your flash drive instead of your main harddrive. The speed is not bad. My Mac doesn't have usb 3.0 so the speed is limited by 2.0 but its definitely usable and I was playing world of warcraft on windows 8 with minor slow downs.



**What You'll Need**

1) A usb drive. The faster the better. It will fit on 16GB but 32GB will give you more space to install applications. An external hard drive will also work. Some flash manufacturers sell certified Windows to go flash drives for a premium. They are not necessary but do make it easier.

2) Windows 8 disk or iso

3) Windows 7 or 8 computer. I did it on a Windows 8 computer but I don't think Windows 7 would be a problem.



**Copy Boot Camp drivers to your build computer**

1) Format your usb drive as FAT

2) Start boot camp assistant and select ""download the latest windows support software from apple""

3) Use your newly formatted usb drive as the destination

4) Remove from MAC and stick in Windows build computer

5) Copy WindowsSupport directory to your windows build computer



**Preparing your USB drive**

All These instructions come from : http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/win8togo


1) Download RMPrepUSB from here: http://www.rmprepusb.com/documents/release-2-0

2) Format your flash drive using the following options: 3. Win bootable (BOOTMGR), 4. NTFS and Boot as HDD

3) Download Windows 8 Waik tools here: http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/getwaiktools/GetWaikTools.zip?attredirects=0

4) Open a administrator command prompt and go to the new downloaded tools folder

5) Assuming your windows 8 source is at k: and your usb flash drive is at u, type

                ImageX.exe /apply k:\Sources\Install.wim 1 u:

6) That takes 20-60 minutes depending on speed then type:

               BCDBOOT u:\Windows /s u: /v

7) Slip the Boot camp drivers into the installation

               dism u:\ /add-driver /driver:*BootCamp Directory*\Drivers /recurse

8) Copy the WindowsSupport bootcamp directory to the new USB



**Starting Windows 8 to go**

1) Insert usb drive into Mac, start or restart the computer

2) Hold down the option key while the Mac is booting

3) Select the windows drive and hit enter

4) Wait



**After Windows is running**

If you're not using one of the designated certified windows to go drives then Windows doesn't work as expected in some cases. To trick Windows into thinking the flash drive is standard non-removable drive do the following:

1) Download the cfadisk usb filter driver here: http://www.fileden.com/files/2011/12/22/3242144/microdrive.7z

2) Open an administrator command prompt and type the following:

            bcdedit /set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS
            bcdedit /set testsigning ON

3) Go to device manager and update the usb flash driver with the downloaded one

4) Reboot while holding down the option button

5) Go to windows explorer, your drive should show up as a normal disk drive and not a removable drive.



**Completing the Boot Camp installation**

1) Go to your bootcamp directory and run setup.exe. That should get all your hardware recognized



Hopefully these instructions are somewhat clear.

1276673219.0,75,self.mac,cfitt,why i will only buy a mac.,,102,27,80,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/cfitt/why_i_will_only_buy_a_mac/,"I walked into a coffee shop near campus recently and counted the laptops. 9 out of 14 were apples of some kind or another, mostly new macbook pro's. admittedly, i was embarrassed to be #10, since so many apple users, who are semi-pro internet surfers and don't take advantage of the machine itself, let alone the OS (myself included), cave in to an image.
but i must admit, if you want to know why i will never buy any other machine, hear this:

I used to love my sony vaio. i work my laptops to the bone, and in 2006 during midterms, it died. i called sony and they said to replace the parts would be about the price of buying a new vaio. so, my tech-savvy (geek) friends bore down on me to invest in a $1200 macbook, despite being pc-users for the most part. i paid $250 for the extended warranty just in case, and it was one of the best decisions i'd made as a professional student, 2nd only to buying a mac. this will become clear in a minute.
now this mac and me were like twins. i do EVERYTHING with it. Programming, Web-design, Flash, and a myriad of other skills i thought would make my purchase worthwhile. i went through 2 screens (one paid for by apple, which NO manufacturer will do), cd drive, airport cards, keyboards, power chords. god damn, i was brutal on it. each time i sent it off to apple and had it back in 3 days tops.
in the meantime, my wife's sister bought a new toshiba that had a problem with the speakers. i called them, and after so many excuses for why they would not touch it (still under toshiba's warranty, mind you) the last communication with toshiba went like this:
toshiba - ""because your computer was purchased in singapore, i.e. internationally, we cannot honor the warranty.""
me - ""I'VE NEVER BEEN TO SINGAPORE!!!"" it was purchased in  indiana.""
toshiba - well, the wholesaler (best buy) bought it in singapore"".
click

finally best buy piped in and said they would replace the computer because it had been repaired 3 times (cf. no lemon law). but they didn't make that model anymore, so they said they would give her one of equal or LESS value and she had to BUY a new warranty. (this part is important).

back to my butchered mac. i REALLY beat the hell out of that thing. my warranty expired on October 23, 2009 so i called two days prior to resolve a flickering screen issue i had noticed (probably from all the times i slammed the lid shut or replaced the screen).
i sent it in, they sent it back, but the issue was not resolved. i called them 2 weeks later (after the warranty expired) and the conversation with Apple this time went something like this:

Apple - ""Mr. Anderson, it seems your computer has had 3 major operations in the past year.""

(at this point i'm thinking, oh shit, they won't repair it because i've been a bad boy and the warranty had expired, typical customer service i've experienced elsewhere. ""even Apple has a 'screw you' policy"" , i thought.
Apple - ""we are very sorry for the inconvenience""
me - ""here it comes..."" i thought.
Apple - we can offer to try to repair it again, but at this point, it is more expensive for us to repair it than replace it.
me - okay
Apple - we would like to GIVE you a new macbook with the same specs. unfortunately we stopped making that model, so we must GIVE you a new macbook.

Alot of people think they're viewing 4K just because they're told it is. when in reality the compression done on alot of those videos is downright amateur, or they don't realize that Flash player is only displaying 1080P
i have recently downloaded ClickToPlugin for Safari and found a few Videos on youtube with an incredible lack of compression, very high quality, and wanted to share with fellow retina owners.
Hoping that maybe you would share some demos and trailers you may have found with particularly stunning quality. (esp movie trailers, most seem to be German)

I just wanted to share a little experience I had yesterday. I was trying to install Windows 7 on my MacBook Pro Retina. Just for shits and giggles. ""What harm could it do?"" I though to myself.

Well, during the installation of Windows I probably checked off the wrong thing after it couldn't find any partitions to install it on and Windows decided to wipe my entire drive.

At first I thought; hmm, that's odd. Why can't I boot back into Mac and does it automatically boot into the recovery drive? After a little inspection (luckily I know a thing or two about computers) I found out I had no partitions anymore, and my entire drive was wept by the Windows installation.

This is where the magic comes in, because I didn't even panic for a second. I went back into the recovery, clicked the ""Restore from Time Machine"" option and within a minute I was well under way to restoring my drive as it was that exact morning. Two hours later my computer was back and it was like I hadn't even tried messing around with the partitions to begin with.

My message here being: Make a goddamn backup. With timemachine, it's as easy as plugging in an external drive and checking the box. There's no reason not to. And even if your Mac feels like it can't be beaten (and most of the time it can't), it's still a computer that can be erased even if you didn't mean to. Having a backup saves lives.

**TL;DR: Make a backup silly.**",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,False,,,True,t3_1i5aaz,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1i5aaz/the_importance_of_making_backups_aka_why/,

After nearly two years of daily use, mine was. I started with a basic Macbook, the first aluminum unibody model. 2.0GHz C2D, 2GB RAM, 160GB, nearly full HDD. I got the beachball all the time and I was considering a new mac. Thankfully, I upgraded instead. Here's what I did, maybe it can help someone else as much as it helped me.

Hardware:

I replaced the 160GB, 5400rpm HDD with a 60GB SSD (OCZ Vertex II, around $120 from Amazon)

I upgraded the 2GB of 1066MHz DDR3 to 8GB ($102, Newegg)

I swapped the optical drive for another HDD. I got the optical bay to SATA converter on eBay for $15 and a 500GB Western Digital HDD on Amazon for $53.

Software:

I ran a fresh install of Snow Leopard on the SSD using the DVD, before I put the optibay in.

I used the magic of Mac OS X's Symlink feature. A symlink is like a shortcut/alias except the system doesn't see it as a file; it treats a symlink as if it were the folder if was linking to. Creating a symlink for your documents, music, and movies folders allow you to store all of your data on the HDD while leaving the system and all apps on the SSD. This effectively gave me the performance of a 512GB SSD ($1400 on Amazon) for the price of $120 (SSD) + $53 (HDD).

Having 8GBs of RAM is overkill for most applications, at least in 10.6's stock configuration. The following tip essentially gave me an SSD-grade performance boost all over again. Essentially, you can use a RamDisk to turbocharge your system. A RamDisk makes your computer think a portion of your RAM is actually a logical drive such as an SSD or an HDD. Esperance DV is a software program that will create a RamDisk and restore data to it automatically upon startup.

The speed boost comes when you copy your computer's most-requested files to the RamDisk and fool it into thinking they are on the boot drive. Again, making a Symlink will do this for you. First, make a backup copy of your Macintosh HD/Users/yourname/Library/Caches folder. Then, copy that to your RamDisk, delete the original folder and create a symlink that points to the RamDisk. The result? Everything is much much faster. Simple, everyday tasks such as web browsing, managing folders, etc become instant. I have even noticed a difference in entering text.

I also moved Google Chrome, iTunes, and my iTunes library (not the songs, just the database) to the RamDisk. The result is around 600MB less of usable RAM, but extreme improvements in everyday computing tasks.

Then, I tweaked settings in Mac OS X to see if I could make it even faster. Two programs will help accomplish this: Onyx and Maintain1. In Onyx, I turned off all animations and useless Mac OS X services. This not only sped everything up a bit more, it killed off all those annoying transitions that are cool to watch the first time, but kill productivity.

Finally, in Maintain1, under the 'Net' tab, I checked the 'quick increase' box. This changes some settings and optimizes your internet connection for high-speed service (no, I'm not sure exactly what it does. Something to do with time-out values). It resulted in a very noticeable acceleration in page load time.

For $290, I made my Mac 'feel' faster than almost any Mac on the market today, that I know of. It proved to be a much better option than buying a new one outright.

Yes, the argument can be made that my computer isn't technically any faster at processor-intensive tasks. It still uses a 2.0GHz Core 2 Duo processor and NVidia 9400M integrated graphics. Rendering video is only slightly faster (due to disk improvements), and gaming is still terrible. However, for everyday tasks such as web browsing, it is many times faster.

Note: Some of the procedures I outlined here are probably risky, such as creating a symlink and moving your cache, not to mention installing an optibay. If you're not comfortable with technology, you should probably not attempt this. But if you are, have fun!

Symlink Instructions:
The best way (that I know of) to efficiently create a working symbolic link is by using the terminal.
Here is a list of what each of these four commands do:

1. Copy all files in your 'documents' folder into a new 'Documents' folder onto Macintosh Data HD (note, the * is used to indicate a space)
2. Modify the old Documents folder to allow it to be removed (usually Mac OS X prohibits this)
3. Remove the old Documents folder
4. Create a symbolic link where the old Documents folder used to be, that points to the newly copied Documents folder on Macintosh Data HD

cp -Rp ~/Documents /Volumes/Macintosh*Data*HD

chmod -R -N ~/Documents

rm -rf ~/Documents

ln -s /Volumes/Macintosh*Data*HD/Documents ~/Documents

The same procedure can be used to move the user cache to your ramdisk, although I highly recommend you make another backup of the folder as well (never have your only copy on the ramdisk, because Esperance DV isn't the best about saving).",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,True,,,True,t3_f6uv4,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/f6uv4/performance_tips/,

Even if you express an interest (posted) and do not continue with the purchase (privately) it can be *assumed* that you made the purchase and according to /r/apple guidelines this is grounds for a ban.

And it's free.  atm I have set it up for quicker navigation of the internet (three finger tap opens a new tab, two finger swipe moves between tabs, three fingers down closes the window, three fingers up reopens the most recent closed window), but I can't wait to set it up to do other things.  It also recognizes me tapping my pinky, ring, middle, and index fingers one after the other as a command to open chrome.  ~~The only issue is that it hasn't been updated since 2011.

Some keybindings I have:
 
 * In the system preferences–&gt;keyboard, I've checked ""use the functions keys as standard functions keys."" 
* I've bound F1-F4 to be window resizing commands with Optimal Layout. |
* I've bound ⌘+F1-F4 to be space moving commands. This is useful with TotalSpaces. 
* In the keyboard shortcuts, there is a selection for ""Take a screenshot and copy it to the clipboard"", and you have to hold down an extra key. I've swapped the ""take a screenshot"" and ""copy to clipboard"" shortcuts so it'd be easier. 


Sorry there are no links - they didn't copy over, as the email wasn't Markdown.

That is no longer a problem! **OS X has a BUILT IN completely random password generator!!** And here's how to access it: 

* 1) Go into finder and search ""Keychain Access""
* 2) Open the program, and if necessary click the lock in the upper left hand corner and enter your system password to access the application
* 3) Now that you can fully access the application, on the bottom of the window click on the little ""+"" symbol
* 4) Now in the window it created, next to the ""Password"" box, click on the image of the key 
* 5) And there you go! Your very own OS X built in password generator! You can choose from the drop-down menu different options of passwords.

1325869270.0,43,self.mac,o5l7c,What's the deal with Growl now?,DoctorOddfellow,52,9,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/o5l7c/whats_the_deal_with_growl_now/,"So I keep getting a notification from Growl to upgrade Growl via the App Store. 

I certainly understand that Lion changed some things and somethingsomething sandboxing blahblah tech stuff I don't get yadda yadda, hence there's got to be a new version of Growl specific to Lion. 

But what was once free software is now $1.99 and only available through the App Store. The two bucks doesn't concern me; I'm happy to support good software, esp if it's only two bucks. But what does concern me is the boatload of reviews on the App Store that says the new version (Growl 1.3.2) doesn't work (apparently because now everyone that had written an app to work with Growl 1.2 has to re-do it to work with Growl 1.3).  

Further adding to the confusion, is [this Growl blog post](http://growl.posterous.com/growl-13-a-summary-of-the-major-changes) that says ""Growl is no longer free to download . . . but you don't need Growl to get notifications. When developers update their application to support Growl 1.3, Growl will no longer be required for them to display a notification to you."" Huh? WTF am I giving you two dollars for then?!

Complicate it even further by the fact that since Growl is open source, it's still possible to get it (presumably Growl 1.3.2) without paying for it by [building it from the source code yourself](http://growl.info/documentation/developer/growl-source-install.php) . . . which again, for us less technical folk, quickly gets into blahblah mercurial yaddayadda Google Code somethingsomething oh look it's time for NCIS re-runs, *thankgod*. 

Wait! More wrinkles! There's also something called [Growl Fork](http://osxdaily.com/2011/12/19/growl-fork-brings-growl-notifications-to-mac-os-x-lion-for-free/) which (since Growl is open source, see above) takes the pre-Lion 1.2.2 version of Growl and does somethingsomething XCode 4.1 blahblah compiles cleanly yaddayadda and now it's 1.2.*2f1* instead of plain ol' 1.2.2. And ""if you don’t need the newer features in the official version and just want compatibility with Lion and your apps to continue receiving notifications, Growl Fork works just fine."" Well, okay, that sound great, but what are the newer features and since the blog post about 1.3 says ""you don't need Growl to get notifications"" do I even need 1.3 for those ""newer features""?!

Sigh. Can someone sort this out for me?

* Which should I run on Lion -- the old Growl 1.2.2, the forked Growl Fork 1.2.2f1, or the new Growl 1.3.2?

* What do I get -- or not get -- running each of those?

1288287006.0,38,self.mac,dxt51,Wishful thinking for OS X Lion,TonyBLiar,47,9,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/dxt51/wishful_thinking_for_os_x_lion/,"When Steve Jobs and other Apple luminaries gave us a sneak peek at OS X 10.7 Lion, at [October's Back to the Mac event](http://events.apple.com.edgesuite.net/1010qwoeiuryfg/event/index.html), it got me thinking about some of the things we've been waiting to see on the Mac for some years which are never likely to appear now that the platform wars are focused on mobile devices and the desktop is effectively entering its twilight years.

Yes, graphical improvements to Exposé and Spaces are always welcome.  And the iPad style changes to the Dock are definitely an improvement.  We Mac users like our eye candy more now than ever before.  But it takes more than a couple of new iMovie templates and iPhoto slideshow presets to divert attention away from the fact that Finder hasn't been updated in forever and we still have to run two different versions of Quicktime Player just to make basic edits to audio and video.

Not that new announcements always have to be about grand gestures.  There's more than a few little things we've been looking forward to Apple fixing for some time too—like the pop-up error message you get if you remove a USB device without ejecting it properly—which even Windows stopped doing years ago—and the lack of a fully integrated backup and restore application that doesn't require the user to manually fetch and carry every Preference Pane and Library folder from a Time Machine archive.  Or the way Finder will stop an operation if just one of the files you want to move or copy from one volume to another is currently open—even if this is a false positive.  Disk Utility still doesn't fix file permissions properly unless you run it from the OS X installer disc.  The wish list is almost endless.

Then there's customisation.  I've been a Mac user for nearly 20 years and I still have no idea how to use Automator.  I know it should be drag and drop simple and I know people who understand AppleScript already say it is, but to ordinary users like me it's still far too complicated.  I spent a week trying to get TextEdit to paste the content of the clipboard, strip page breaks and insert some basic HTML, before finding out that Automator doesn't fully support TextEdit scripting and has a strange bug which records every mouse movement in ultra-slow motion which can only be stopped by forcing the entire machine to restart.

I suppose what we long-time Mac users ultimately wished for from OS X Lion, in reality is more than any mere Operating System can ever hope to deliver—but that's sort of my point.  Once upon a time, Apple used to glory in bringing something exceptional to the Mac; something no-one expected them to do.  Whereas these days we're already hearing feedback on iPhoto 11 which is a sad echo of the sort of criticism once reserved for Microsoft's half efforts at copying the Mac; an overly simplistic interface, no customisation, retrogressive changes to fullscreen controls, a lack of professional level import / export capabilities, and so on.

I'm sure when it eventually arrives, OS X Lion will be a great improvement to Snow Leopard in the way Leopard was to Tiger—but I fear some of the unique idiosyncrasies which have been rattling around inside OS X's belly ever since Panther will remain—and those of us who champion the Mac to our friends and family every day will still face the inevitable barrage of questioning about ""only having one mouse button"" and ""no software"".

It would have been nice to finally bury at least one of these myths, with what we really wanted to hear Steve Jobs say; that Apple had finally begun to integrate into iLife and iWork some of the software we all know Apple's R &amp; D department has been sitting on for years—like a Photoshop killer level of image editing and an update to Pages that kicks Microsoft's Word into the dirt.  It's looking more and more like this has now been pushed back to the 2050 release of OS X Mountain Goat.

I noticed that my Macbook (13"", bought it three months ago) wasn't turning on. Battery light was on but nobody home. I took it to a licensed reseller who took one look inside and said that there was food in the machine so I had to take it to Apple. I thought 'no way' - I'm the only one who uses it, and it sits on my desk where there's no food. So I took it to the Apple store, sure there had been some kind of mistake. A day later they call me back. The guy on the phone is incredibly awkward— ""We've never seen anything like this before, I'm very sorry to tell you..."" and so on. Apparently a slug crawled inside the back left-hand vent (underneath the screen hinge) and committed a violent act of martyrdom all over my nearly-new machine. He told me it is (a) not covered by my warranty (because apparently slug vengeance falls into the same category as knocking a can of coke over on the keyboard) and (b) not ""economically salvageable"". He said I could take it to a non-Apple store if I wanted to, but that was the end of it as far as they were concerned. It's also not covered by my personal insurance. 

I'm pretty devastated. It's almost new, I've been incredibly careful with it, and I've never even SEEN a slug in my house. As far as I can see, I have the following options:

* Beg for an exception to be made. Is this possible? Would they listen to my pitiful tale? 
* Try to get it fixed by someone not connected to Apple. This is a possibility, but if the slug has done some horrible damage then is it worth it? I don't know how far the slug could possibly have gotten inside, should I open it up and have a look? 
* Sell it as broken online. Shed a few quiet tears and save up money for a new laptop. Comfort myself with thought of the horrible melty death the slug must have experienced.
* ???? Is there anything I'm missing? ",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,False,,,True,t3_w9kfh,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/w9kfh/so_a_slug_crawled_into_my_macbook_and_melted_any/,

Anyway, it just showed up on my Find iPhone (Find my Mac) app so I called the police and reported that I had the location. My case officer is not on duty so they are going to have another officer call me back.

My question is this. Has anyone ever dealt with this situation and what are my realistic odds of getting the computer back? Also, do you have any tips for dealing with the police here? Thanks.

Update: So they got me in contact with the officer who had me send a screenshot and any related info like the area and zip code so he could add it to the file. He then told me to contact the police in that area to see if they could do anything about it. We talked the logistics of actually getting it back since a house came up instead of a public place before hanging up. He then called me back about 5 minutes later, before I contacted the other police department, and told me I should wait cause there is an ongoing investigation into a string of burglaries in my town by people coming from this town and this address may already be under surveillance already. He passed the info off to detectives and asked me to notify him if anything comes up again. All in all the officer was very friendly and helpful and I have some pretty high hopes of recovering my computer and possibly busting a gang of burglars in the process.

* So, most of us know you can open a file in a Spotlight search within its folder in Finder by holding down Command when you select/click on an item, but I only just discovered that if you hold down *Option+Command* with a search item highlighted in the list, it will show you the location of the item without having to go to Finder. This was the main reason I used to use the open in Finder feature anyway!

* Did you know you can Get Info on an item in the search list by highlighting it and pressing Command+I? Not all system shortcuts work - Command+C doesn't copy the item, for example.

* You can drag an item from the search list directly into an application (e.g. to add a mail attachment, or drop an image into Word).

* If you drag an item from the search list onto your Desktop, or into a Finder pane, by default you will create an alias to that item. Hold down *Option* while you drag, and you will make a copy instead.

* Dragging an item from the search list into a File-&gt;Open dialog box *doesn't* automatically select the file's location for you (like it would if you dragged an item from a Finder window). Instead it seems to copy the item into the folder that is currently selected in the dialog box. Weird.

* You can perform a Spotlight search *while you are dragging items*. Let's say you have 3 images you want to open in Photoshop, but Photoshop is not running and is not in your Dock. Select the 3 files, start dragging, press Command+Space, type your search to bring up Photoshop, hit Enter. The app will open, and you can now drop your files into the Dock icon. (I use this for quickly creating zip files with the 3rd-party archiver Keka). 

* You probably know, but I'll mention it just in case; you can use Spotlight as a calculator by typing a formula directly into the search field. In this mode, you can also hit Return to launch the Calculator app (unfortunately it doesn't launch with your formula entered).

Anyone found any other tips or shortcuts?

* On each computer, initiate a Folder Action on the folder that Chrome/Firefox/Safari downloads to. This is done through Automator. Set that download folder to move any file within, with an extension of ""torrent"", to that Dropbox folder you created (which should exist on all of your computers running Dropbox)

* On the computer you're using for downloading, open up Transmission and head to the Preferences-&gt;Transfers-&gt;Adding. In there, you'll see an option to watch for torrent files in a folder. Choose the Dropbox folder you created earlier. Right above it, if you have ""Display a window when opening a torrent file"" checked, make sure you also check ""Only when adding manually"".

Now if only I could get this to work with magnet links.. oh well. Enjoy!",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,False,,,True,t3_13ku2h,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/13ku2h/my_method_for_managing_torrent_downloads_via/,

What to do?,Foundmac2012,43,8,43,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/yhzvf/found_a_macbook_pro_what_to_do/,"So I found a MacBook Pro the other day outside of a coffee shop. I left my name and number with the shop so if the owner came back looking for it they could reach me. I put an ad up on Craigslist also. So far, no contact from either source. 

I tried to get into the computer but the admin is password protected and you can't even start it in single user mode. I was hoping that there would be some kind of info there that would help me ID the owner or maybe activate some kind of ""find my Mac"" app that would alert them.

I really would like to get it back to its owner but, if no response after a couple weeks should I keep it? Would I even be able to have it made to work? Alternatively, any other ideas that might help me get it where it belongs?

This reddit client I am working on, Martian, is open source, on [Github](https://github.com/LeavesMonroe/Martian), and thus free.

Do not be mistaken however, this is *not* a fully functional program.

Here is my checklist (Plus other unmentioned stuff I have mentally retained):

* ~~A Name~~
* ~~Plan for a native user interface~~
* ~~An open source licensing plan~~
* ~~JSON Querying~~
* ~~Authentication into Reddit~~
* Basic Functionality: Reading posts and comments
* Advanced functionality: Upvote, downvote, message sending, comments
* Icons for subreddits
* Native page navigation: NSPageController with two finger swiping

As a community, I need your help! You can give me tips, suggestions, criticisms, questions, programming assistance, graphical assistance; anything. You can fork it on Github and help out too.

You can check out [recent progress](https://github.com/LeavesMonroe/Martian/commits/master) on Github, and/or view a [screenshot](http://imgur.com/Phdz3) of the application (Last updated August 1, 2012).

While I've never 'hated' Apple (after all, I do have an iPhone 4...), I always felt as though their products were outrageously priced as a result of stereotypes/branding. 

Well, this past week I was awarded a scholarship (I'm a senior in high school). The scholarship was for $10,000 towards college - that being said, the scholarship committee 'decided' to throw in a 2011 Macbook Air. The scholarship itself was a more than welcome surprise, but the additional Mac topped it off.

After the excitement of the surprise died down, I decided to try out the Mac. It turned out it was the base-model (64 gb HD/2 gb ram/i5) of the newest edition MBA - I was/am happy enough with being given a computer, so the lower specs didn't bother me at all.

My initial experience(s) with the Mac have been great. OSX Lion is phenomenal - the intuitiveness of its design as well as the user-friendliness has made learning it a breeze. Additionally, everything seemed to run fluidly on the Mac and its power/speed was much greater than I previously expected. While I LOVE both the build quality and OS of the Mac, I just finished installing Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit on the MBA using a separate partition. I plan on using both OSs to suit my needs, as I find them both to be wonderful. Also, my experience with installing Windows on it was easier than I could have imagined - Boot Camp allowed me to instantly mount my Windows Iso onto a flash drive and boot right from there. It also supplied me with all of the necessary fixes that made the Mac much more compatible/usable with Windows.

TL;DR: I, a longtime Windows/PC lover, was recently given a Mac and I cannot help but admit that it is absolutely wonderful. While I still think that Apple's pricing is unnecessarily high, I can honestly say that the OS and the build quality are top notch and I now understand why so many people love them. I am now a happy Mac/PC hybrid user, and love both for their respective qualities.

Long live Mac/PC! :D",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,False,,,True,t3_lnoyz,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/lnoyz/long_time_windowspc_fanboy_finally_gave_in_not_by/,

I've played with my girlfriend's Mac a little, but other than that, I'm pretty much a Mac virgin. I really like the look and feel of OS X, and the machines themselves are beautiful. I'm graduating next month, and my family is treating me to a new computer. I've decided that since I'd probably never be able to justify buying one for myself, that now is the time to get a Mac.

Are there any caveats or tips I should be aware of as a new user coming from a PC background? Are there any areas where ""good habits"" from Windows don't necessarily translate well to OS X? I'm going to be doing graphic design(mostly with Adobe Creative Suite 4), and I'd like the transition to be as smooth as possible so that I can stay efficient. Any advice on how I can get up to speed quickly would be greatly appreciated!

If anyone cares, I'm getting the 27"" iMac with the Core 2 Duo. 

EDIT: Damn. The Mac Store here is sold out of 27"" iMacs. I'm going to try again tomorrow, and if not I'm just going to order it. I hate the idea of waiting a week for something, though!

EDIT 2: Are Apple Store employees all idiots? Called up there today, and they said they got some more 27"" iMacs in today. Drove all the way out there and waited for an associate, he pulled one out, rung me up, and gave me total before he realized there was more than one version of the 27"" iMac. Turns out, the girl who I talked to on the phone wasn't aware of that, either. WTF? I'm still iMac-less, and annoyed with Apple already.

EDIT 3: Day 3 of not being able to procure my Mac...I'm really unimpressed with the retail side of Apple. Should I wait an indefinite amount of time for them to get one in, or just go ahead and order one and wait a week?

EDIT 4: Finally got my iMac today! Best Buy matched my student discount, so I got it from there instead. Same computer, same support, so why not?

For this example, I will be showing you how to reset jetbrains PhpStorm for another 30 day trial without uninstalling. I'm doing this because I started the trial 30 days ago and never got a chance to use the program before it ran out.

1. Open Terminal (Apps/Utilities/Terminal).
2. Figure out the actual process name of your program. For me, you'd expect this to be PhpStorm, but in fact it wasn't, instead it was 'webide'.
3. In the terminal, run 'sudo opensnoop' and watch the massive list of file changes and accesses. What you're looking at is the activity of all the programs on your computer (running) accessing files on your drive. If you don't know what your program's name is, run it now and watch the names running along the left side - you should see a different one show up, like webide.
4. With your name, close the program, then run 'sudo opensnoop -n yourName', example 'sudo opensnoop -n webide'. 
5. Open the program. When the app gets to the license denial screen, press ctrl + c in the terminal window and close the app.
6. Examine the files accessed when the program was launched. Check the ones loaded just before you stopped it. I saw a few of interest:

'/var/folders/5g/5g5enqVqELOpC63u3oBrFk+++TI/-Caches-//mds/mdsDirectory.db ' - In the var folder with 'caches' in the path. Probably something temporary and perhaps related to licenses. Delete this folder with the command (be careful with this one): 'rm -r -f /var/folders/5g/'. 

The most obvious of these is the one containing 'eval.key', an obvious evaluation license key.
'/Users/username/Library/Preferences/WebIde50/eval/PhpStorm5.evaluation.key' among a few others. Delete this folder (the library/prefs/webide50 folder). 

Do this for any files that appear temporary, in your users folder, and related to licensing.

7. Launch the program. For me, I got the ""30 day trial, 30 days left"" again. Congrats! This time, try the trial and buy it if you use it.",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,False,,,True,t3_18l6tj,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/18l6tj/how_to_reset_trial_of_any_mac_app/,

Totalfinder - really makes using the finder a whole lot better.

Plex - an excellent way to organise and play movies and tv shows.

Airfoil - as I don't have wireless headphones, airfoil lets me stream the audio from my mac to my iPhone so that I can lie in bed and stay up watching tv without disturbing my room mate next door (paper thin walls)

So, here's my shot at one:

List of (free) apps needed:

* AppCleaner - http://www.freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/
* CCleaner - http://www.piriform.com/mac/ccleaner
* OnyX - http://www.titanium.free.fr/downloadonyx.php
* Disk Utility - In-built

Pre-1 - **Make a backup**. I'm not responsible for any screw-up. Nor will I help you fix it. Boo-hoo. I also won't explain anything further, google is your friend.

1 - Start by running CCleaner, the default setup should work.

2 - Run OnyX, check S.M.A.R.T., you can cancel the verification of volume structure (we'll get to that later). On the Maintenance tab, in ""Permissions"", check ""Reset home directory and ACLs"" and execute. In Scripts, check all the boxes and execute. On ""Rebuild"", leave everything default and execute it.

3 - **THIS ONE IS OPTIONAL**

Follow what is described [here](http://james.brooks.so/blog/fixing-slow-osx-startup/)
&gt; * Restart your Mac, hold ⌘ + S which’ll boot you into Single User Mode.
&gt;* Run *fsck -y* to check the boot volume’s file system
&gt; * Next run *mount -uw /* which mounts the boot volume
&gt;* To fix the ACLs run *chmod -R -N /Volumes*
&gt;* Type reboot


4 -  Reboot into your recovery partition. Run Disk Utility. Verify (and if needed repair permissions) and Verify (and if needed repair) your main HD (usually ""Macintosh HD"").

5 -  Reset your [SMC](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht3964) and [PRAM](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht1379)

That's it! This should speed things up (it did for me).

would there be a downside to upgrading the RAM with 2 8 GB sticks for a total of 24? This would equal 2 x 4gb RAM sticks and 2 x 8gb RAM  sticks.

Here's what I think.

For home use I'll probably never go back. If I had to sum up the quite frankly beautiful operating system in one word it would be *""quiet""*. There's no extraneous noise, you just do what you do simply and efficiently, and in a pretty slick manner. Stuff just works too. Every time. Even little things like putting it to sleep takes... 0.1 seconds. Bang. Wakes up instantly too.

But here also are my gripes.

You can't really operate OS X using *just* the keyboard. Stay with me here. I'm writing this on a little Asus eeePC running Windows XP, and I pretty much operate in *entirely* by the keyboard. After 15 years you just learn the hotkeys. And let's face it, computers are here to stay so you have all the time in the world to learn the hot keys. Minimise the window, maximise it to, alt+tab of course, all of the /alt + *a* + *a* combinations, add in the windows key combinations. CUT AND PASTE using keyboard only (I'm talking files here). Paste a file or folder with same name and Windows will handle it, elegently. F2 to rename a file, This I miss from OS X. You just learn this stuff over 15 years and the keyboard is like *heaps* faster than the mouse. heaps (weird choice of vernacular there).

If I could just hit the Alt key, or its equivalent and key combos would underline, like they do in Windows, since forever, OS X would not just be better, but perfect. Also I'd like to be able to resize windows from *any* edge, but I hear this is (finally) coming in Lion. Fuck, that seems like a major oversight for a long time.

OK, OK don't want to seem a complete negative bore, so here is my little insight. Mac and PC are not diametrically opposed, they are at an angle to each other. Perhaps 120 degrees. Windows/PC is work (and it really is), and Mac is play. For example Windows will maybe never have any connection to something like the B &amp; W Zeppelin Air playing Groove Salad (Soma FM App) over AirPlay, like I'm listening to right now. This is typical Mac sexiness (btw airplay don't sound as good as when the iPod is connected, damn it) 
...But Windows has hot keys. 

The end.

Check it before you leave the store!,amaltheas2,31,6,13,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/fuc9l/buying_a_new_macbook_pro_check_it_before_you/,"I just bought the newly released 15"" Mac book Pro (15"" non-glossy w/ high-res display).  I opened it up as soon as I got home, and found it had a big [dent](http://i.imgur.com/WN6AI.jpg) right out of the box!


I took it back and requested an exchange.  I opened this one in the store, it also had a dent!  In the same spot!  I should have walked away ... but I wanted to try one more time.  They brought me a second replacement, which was finally in brand new, unscathed condition!  My working theory is that dent on the bottom of the laptop is caused by sitting on top of the power cord in the box (poor packaging design).

Hopefully this was just a fluke and no one else will experience this frustration.  If you're looking for a new mac, please take the time and inspect your new purchase before you leave the store. 


**TL;DR** - I bought a new 15"" Macbook Pro and it had a dent.  The replacement also was dented.  The third was as I'd expect to get for paying a $2500 sticker price: Without damage or blemishes.  BEWARE.

Couple Questions...,,28,4,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/d8d6u/so_i_just_got_a_mac_after_15_years_on_the_pci/,"So a couple weeks ago I had my current Windows operating PC die on me. I've had PC's die on me before and I've always fixed them, I know how to build one from scratch and all that jazz. But this time, I had enough. I got sick of diagnosing my PC constantly, fixing bugs, having programs crash on auto updates, etc, etc, etc. I decided to buy a Mac. I used one through my web development program at University and loved it. It handled Pro Tools and Final Cut Pro like it was babysitting a tired infant.

Long story short, I've had this iMac for a couple weeks now and I absolutely love it. It's insane how responsive it is compared to my previous experiences. However, I used to keep a lot of movies, and music on my PC and stream them to my Xbox. Now, I've done research and found programs for this like 'Connect360', and actually streaming from my Mac to Xbox is not going to be an issue. However, these are a couple questions I have:

1) How is the iMac (i believe I have the newest one, I can give specs if needed) with multimedia? Can I just put all my music and videos on there and not see any kind of dip in performance.

2) How much do I need to maintain this? I was very regimental about defrags, virus scans, etc on my PC. I would go through and clean it up as often as I could. Are there programs like that on a mac? How should I maintain it? Do they need maintaining?

3) I heard the iMac's ""Sleep"" function is phenomenal. How often should I turn off (completely power down) my iMac? Should I just sleep it when I'm not using it?

4) If Apple updates the OS, will I get the free update?

Any and all help would be very appreciated, and again if you want any more info or specs please let me know...thanks reddit mac! And yes, some of these questions I probably should have asked before buying but I knew I wouldn't be disappointed with my decision.

Hello /r/mac,

I have a mac mini running 10.8.2 attached to a Viewsonic CDP4235-T via HDMI &amp; USB.  The screen successfully shows up as a mouse, and I can interact via touchscreen.

However, the calibration is off.   There does not appear to be a built in calibration function, at least not easily accessible.   And Viewsonic doesn't provide software to do this.
     
While I wait on the phone with tech support, does anyone have any suggestions?

Thanks!

Edit: Viewsonic tech support not too helpful -- ""Touch seems to not be supported for Mac"".   

Edit 2: SOLVED!

The touch controller is a Lumio CrystalTouch optical controller.  The solution seemed to be to install the Lumio CrystalTouch Setup (which is the User version) from here: http://www.lumio.com/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=cat_view&amp;gid=6&amp;Itemid=188

Tell the monitor that it's attached to a Mac, and then reboot everything.

I have never, for all intents and purposes, used a mac in my life. I'm not too worried about picking up how to use it, I figure that will take time no matter what.

I like to switch between using my laptop when I'm out and about to using my desktop when I'm at home. So what kind of compatibility issues am I looking at.

I'll be using it for uni, and I want to be able to play games on it (Steam games, GW2 et cetera). I am a bit conflicted because they both have features that I am attracted to. I made a list of pros and cons for the retina, and need some advice and a bit of a push in the right direction:

Retina Pros:

- thinner

- lighter

- twice the screen resolution

- more video RAM

- supports more RAM? (not sure about that)

- has a HDMI port (would use this)

- better battery (95Wh vs 77.5Wh)

cons

- same CPU

- same GPU

- no optical drive

- no ethernet port (bit of a bummer IMO)

- no subwoofer? (not really sure why I'm adding this)

Thanks in advance.

Edit_2: Thank you everyone for your input and information, there were aspects that I had overlooked and things I learned that I didn't know before.

This is my first post to this subreddit, so I hope I am judging the tone of the community here correctly when I ask for help as a Mac newbie. I've never even lurked here, so I guess I am taking a chance.

I got a Macbook Pro back in April for the usual reasons, just got really tired of Windows and slowness. One thing I was assured that Mac did better was organize media, such as pictures and video. My wife and I have a 1 year old, so our collection has grown exponentially since 2011. One thing we definitely wanted to do was make DVD's that we could send to parents and grandparents. I consider myself computer-savvy, but not creative or patient enough to spend hours editing transitions and music cues, etc.

Immediately, I discovered that iMovie (2011) is just hard to use. I was hoping that I could just browse my media folders, and just drag movies into a project. Since I use Picasa, I need to import every photo or video I need to use into iMovie, which slows things down and wastes space. Once imported, it is hard to find, since videos are organized into events, and I don't know how to add my entire back catalog of media. There doesn't seem to be an easy to way add a video to a project in one click.

So:

1) Do I really need to import every single media file into iMovie to use it?

2) Is there a simpler way to create movies in iMovie (or another software) without all the tools I will never need or understand?

Or, as the title suggests, am I just an idiot?",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,False,,,True,t3_z2rdu,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/z2rdu/is_imovie_difficult_to_use_or_am_i_just_an_idiot/,

In my experiences, this is what I've found...

**Safari**

Safari isn't terrible. It's somewhat fast, sleek, and fits into the overall integration of the OS. However, it's also addon-retarded and not quite as fast as some of its competitors.

**Firefox**

Nowadays Firefox just feels like bloatware to me. Initially speedy and fine, it slows down over time as the pipes fill up with cludge from unseen sources. It always happens, without fail. Great community, great plugin support, just not great optimization for the OS.

I'm sure a few of you saw [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/y4md9/friend_recently_opened_a_new_business_dealing_in/) the other day about how a fellow redditor and a friend of his recently opened their own business dealing with Mac accessories.


After quickly glancing through their site I figured I'd order another case for my 13"" MBP. I like the aluminum look of the MBP, but my black Speck Satin case always blocked it out, so I opted for clear. Below are some pictures of the package, the case and what it looked like after being applied.

[Album!](http://imgur.com/a/OxhNZ#0)

As you can see, you can't even tell it's there (which is exactly what I wanted). It also feels very secure. Actually more secure than my Speck Satin case, which leaves a small lip in the back near the fans. The only caveat of this is that the top portion is an absolute bitch to remove once it's on. Granted it only took me ten minutes, but the speck was removed in less than a minute. Double edged sword, but I feel like this is a plus since with the speck I sometimes felt myself wondering if I ever did accidentally knock my computer down if the case would just pop off. Not the case at all here.

I ordered the case with standard shipping at 2:30am on Monday the 13th. It was delivered before noon today, Wednesday the 15th, so props there. As for the material...It seems almost a little harder than the satin finish on my other case, though still nowhere near as slick as other ""hard cases"". It grips tables and clothing (on my lap) comfortably instead of sliding everywhere like a normal hard case.

Overall, I'm very satisfied. The price alone was enough for me to try it, and I'm honestly thinking of stocking up on two more just to have some variety.

    while [ 1 ];do vardate=$(date +%d\-%m\-%Y\_%H.%M.%S); screencapture -t jpg -x ~/Desktop/ScreenRecord/$vardate.jpg; sleep 1; done

Every 1 second (or whatever value you set after the 'sleep' command) a screenshot of your main screen will be placed in the ScreenRecord folder on your desktop.

When you've captured all the images you want, stop the loop in Terminal.app by hitting CTRL + C

Now open Quicktime Player 7 (regular Quicktime Player that ships with Snow Leopard onwards is feature crippled but you can still download version 7 from Apple.com).

In the file menu choose 'Open image sequence'.  Choose the first image in the folder and click OK.  Then choose the frame rate.

You can now Save As or Export your video into whatever format your currently installed Codecs will allow.  Badda bing!

I've been living with it until now and just decided to see if there's anything I can do. All you're gonna need is a little piece of electrical tape. 

Cut about a 1"" segment of electrical tape and cut it into a shape like [this](http://i.imgur.com/ric6plr.jpg). The coin is the same size as the US quarter. 

Insert the tape into the headphone jack like [this](http://i.imgur.com/cHaurRu.jpg). Make sure the skinny part of the tape goes on the bottom side of the headphone jack. Also make sure only about half of the skinny section of the tape actually goes inside the jack so it doesn't cover the metal on the inside. The pictures should be self explanatory.

Hope this helps!

I brought it to my local Geniuses who said one of the RAM cards was slight off kilter, rest the card, babysat the computer for a day while streaming video as the battery charged and ran down over and over. They said it was fixed.

It still powers down at random moments - sometimes shutting off completely, other times going to ""sleep"" and refusing wake up until I plug it in - but only when disconnected from the power adapter. I brought it back to the Geniuses who tested the battery and ran all their system diagnostics, again played with it for a few days and claim to never once have seen it shut down, and gave it a clean bill of health.

I just found this wonderful community, and I look forward to partaking in conversation here!

I thought I would introduce myself to /r/Mac by doing an AMA for you guys!

A little bit of history on my Mac experience: I have used Macs since 1984, over 10 years of sales (including directly for the Apple), 5 years of tech bench experience (plus more, unofficially), and am anywhere from familiar to fluent with most of their products. I have also been to Macworld in a journalistic capacity, so I think it's safe to say I've had my fair share of angles from which to view the company.

While I have experience fixing iPods and such, there are no Apple-Certified iPod repair people, other than at the company itself (or at least not in my day). This means that, while I can troubleshoot or answer questions about them, I don't have much official knowledge about them.

My official repair career ended about the time the new glass-faced iMacs came out, but I have serviced many a machine since then.

Also note that Apple makes heavy use of non-disclosure agreements. I will try and share as much as I can, but I hope you understand that I can't reveal too much about internal workings.

Anyhow, Ask Me Anything, and I promise you'll at least get an answer!

I just have to do a bit of digging for my certifications, but I know where my Apple biz cards are.

Edit: Alright, I think I'm good for answers tonight! However, keep sending your questions to this post if you want them answered! I'll be dipping back every once in a while over the next few days, I'm sure :)

Inspired by its success, I decided to put together another guide. This time I will share a few interface tweaks that I have used to get the very most out of my Mac.

Hardware: These tips require any MacBook with a multi-touch trackpad (any Macbook from late 2008 or later) or any Mac with a Magic Trackpad.

Software: You will need to download BetterTouchTool and Alfred, and enable Spaces.

BetterTouchTool: This app allows you to customize your trackpad to get the most out of it. You can make any number of useful customizations, but I will include the ones that I have made (and that I consider to be the most useful).

It also enables a Windows 7-like feature of maximizing a window when it is dragged to the top of the screen, or resizing it to the left or right half of your display when it is dragged to a corresponding side.

First: Spaces. Virtual desktops are convenient, but using the keyboard to switch between them is not the best solution. I have configured BTT so that a three-finger swipe up, down, left, or right moves to the corresponding space. After a few minutes, once you get used to it, you will never go back. For example, I keep iTunes running in a space directly to the right of my browser, and switching songs is as easy as a swipe right, click, swipe left. No thought required.

Here is a link to the setup that I have in BTT:

http://min.us/mvb2tt

Also, a four finger swipe down closes the current tab / window, and a four finger swipe left closes your program (after asking about changes, of course).

Alfred is a great way to launch apps really fast, I recommend you disable the spotlight key combo (cmd+space) and use it for Alfred instead. It's really convenient.

These tips (especially in conjunction with the performance guide) really accelerate your Mac experience and reduce frustration.",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,True,,,True,t3_f76al,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/f76al/interface_tips/,

Long story short I'm trying to re-burn my DVD collection that I had on an external drive but it crashed and I lost everything. 

On my old MBP I had a program called Instant Handbrake, it was a slimed down version of Handbrake that worked like a charm, and it still does for most of my DVD's except for a few where there are subtitles at certain points in the movie. 

These are English movies that have parts in them where someone is speaking in a foreign/alien language and so I want the subtitles to come up for that part. 

With Instant Handbrake sometimes it includes this and sometimes it doesn't. 

I downloaded Handbrake and honestly compared to Instant Handbrake it's a pain in the ass. It takes forever and so far I have had zero luck getting any movie to output properly let alone with the included subtitles. 

The one thing I liked about Instant Handbrake was that it was quick dirty and easy and free.

All I want to do is crete a repository of all my DVD's to use with Plex via my Roku and to copy a few movies onto our iPads here at home for travel purposes. 

Does anyone know of any programs out there besides Handbrake that are really simple and easy to do this? I'm surprised that after all these years it hasn't got any easier?

THINK BEFORE YOU ACT.*



Just cross-posting a comment I made earlier on the Dota2 board about how I repaired my 2011 MBP.  Went from 800mHz @ 75-80C idle and &gt;100C load (causing crashes/shutdown) to 56-60C idle and 80-85C 100%load (2.5gHz with boost)

This thing is finally running like the product I had intended on owning YEARS back when I purchased it.  If you're having similar issues, throttling, shitty rendering, overheating, etc... I would be willing to bet you have the same issue and can fix it just as cheaply as I did.  I know the problem has been known about for many years (and denied by PLENTY of apple employees lololol) but it's there.  It looked like someone built a fortress of thermal paste in a wall AROUND my chip and the ship itself had practically nothing on it.  Pathetic.  Anyways, $30 for tools, canned air, and good paste, and now it feels like I own a brand new machine.  

Props to the guys I quoted from macrumors and youtube, they've covered this years back, but I still want you guys to know that it's a real problem and it's easy to fix!
_______________________________________________
Those models have a manufacturing defect.  The factory over-applied thermal paste to the CPU/GPU, and as such they've managed to create a heat-insulation barrier around the processing units that forces them to throttle themselves into an unusable nightmare.  I was idling at 75C with fans maxed, and every time I ran dota (or any game), my CPU was clocking down to 800mHz, and heating up over 95C until the sensors kicked in and shutdown the system (to avoid heat damage).


Apple doesn't recognize this as a recall or manufacturing issue (typical apple nonsense), but if you have AppleCare, you should be able to have them perform the labor (check logic board condition, replace if necessary, re-apply thermal paste, etc)

I am of the mentality that the ""geniuses"" are just googlers with a knack for working on computers, and not actually more qualified than me to perform repairs.  I bought my own tools (well, just a t6 torx screwdriver, I already had everything else) and thermal paste, and did the tear-down and re-application this weekend and have seen an improvement that I didn't think was possible.  I'm idling at ~55C, with 20% fan speed (cant even hear them), and under load, my 2.2 i7 is boosting up around 2.6gHz, and with max fan speed keeping itself around 85-88C (which is perfect temp for these chips).

I used Antec Formula 7 thermal compound and it worked flawlessly.  

Here's a [walkthrough](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=1105643) on a forum that shows you the problem and what to expect.  Here's a [youtube walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlMxoHK0Os4) of the same process.  The pictures you see in that forum post were MUCH better than what I found in mine.  It looked like they had put a dollop of thermal paste the size of a wasabi serving at a sushi restaurant and just squashed it with the heatsink.  

I have never seen this computer run so perfectly.  I've had it since it was new, and it's running faster now than it ever has.  It was not an ""easy"" job.. (if you're not used to notebook disassembly, it wasnt too hard for me but I've been repairing computers since I was a kid), but it's not out of reach for anyone who's done similar work.

I currently use my computer to do:

* Web design (Photoshop and text editing)

* Research Computing (I use R to churn through data, and my MacBook can mostly keep up, but would getting this be just the same? Much better? Slightly worse?)
* Watching HD movies (720 and 1080 .mkv files)
* I also consider doing basic gaming. I bought Starcraft II, but found that it wouldn't run on my MacBook due to graphics constraints, could I run it decently on the 13"" air or will I be pushing it?

I considered the 15"" Pro, but I will be carrying it back and forth every day, and kind of like the idea of it being light.

But rather than being patient when it came to dragging and dropping the whole mess back onto iPhoto, after reinstalling the OS, I left hold of the mouse button too early and accidentally started copying all 4000+ files onto the Desktop.

After having no choice but to force the computer to restart, things then got worse after reboot when Finder tried to display the 1000+ image icons that had already been copied to the Desktop which had successfully copied themselves over while Finder was hanging, previous to my forcing a restart.  This left the boot-up procedure unable to complete and I had no way of launching Finder to rescue it from itself.

So I did something I've never done before but was surprised to find how easy it was, so I'm passing it along to you.

If Finder gets stuck on something that won't allow you to boot normally—or boot for long enough to fix something that prevents normal operation—boot from the OS X installer CDROM and choose Terminal from the Utilities menu.

Even though you can't see any of your hard drives on the desktop (because the installer CDROM doesn't launch Finder) you can still mount and unmount your connected hard drives from inside Disk Utilities and Terminal.

In Terminal type:

    cd /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD
    
to navigate to the folder or folders you think are causing the issue.  In my case it was the Desktop folder in my user directory.  Once there I used the UNIX command mv to move all image files to another folder, like so, after first creating the target folder with the command mkdir:

    mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/JPEGMoved
    mv *.jpg /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/JPEGMoved
    mkdir /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/RawMoved
    mv *.crw /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/RawMoved

You can then reboot as normal and everything inadvertently moved to the Desktop will have been moved into a folder inside your main Macintosh HD, in this case named RawMoved and JPEGMoved, or whatever you chose to name it with the mkdir command

Note, you don't have to type the full /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD path each time you want to move to a different folder.  Just hit TAB once you've completed the first few characters of your drive name and Terminal will predict the rest of the path for you.

Hope that helps!",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,True,,,True,t3_e27v3,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/e27v3/note_to_self_dont_accidentally_drag_and_drop_over/,

My brother claims to have researched this, and says the following:

Modern battery technology (general and not specific to Macs) has a ""recharge count,"" which is finite. Example: battery has X number of charge cycles. Regardless of whether you have only used 50% of the current charge, plugging it in will kill one of your finite number of charges. So if you're the kind of user (I am) who uses your MacBook for 30 minutes on the couch, and then goes upstairs to plug it in, you're essentially wasting a charge. He has also said that there is a ""trickle charge"" feature, which does not use one of the finite charges -- but that is only used when you're already at, say, 95% (not sure of real number).

Can anyone confirm this? Am I blowing my limited number of charges by casually plugging/unplugging?

What about when I plug it in to charge, but the plug gets yanked -- and I plug it right back in? A whole new charge?

I ve been seriously considering buying my next machine and I m really confused which way to go. Basically I'm a developer doing loads of coding... so I'm really after good performance. This is what I've narrowed down to 

-MBA | 1.7GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i7 | Turbo Boost up to 3.3GHz | 8GB 1600MHz LPDDR3 SDRAM | 256GB Flash Storage

-MBP | 2.9GHz Dual-core Intel Core i7 | Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz | 8GB 1600MHz DDR3 SDRAM — 2x4GB | 750GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm | SuperDrive 8x (DVD±R DL/DVD±RW/CD-RW)


- Is the MBA developer friendly? 
- Does Retina Display make a huge world of difference? 
- SSD performance v normal HDD? 

Please help me out with your comments. 
PS:I have been a Windows/Linux user throughout my life. I hope I'm making the right choices

Wanted a mac for a very long time now and finally was able to afford the damned thing.  So, having said that, here are my questions:

1.  After searching many different times/ways, I've found many of the same old ""10 things you should know about Macs!"".  They are all pretty helpful, but I just feel somehow that I'm not quite using the thing to it's full potential.  So, any good hints/tips that you think may not have been posted somewhere else?

2.  Does anyone know if it's REALLY worth getting MacKeeper?  I ask because it seems to be the bee's knees on das interwebs, and its on sale, so I just want to know if there's anything better, or just more worth the money?

Thanks.

Being the ""computer guy"" of the family I have had to job of closing down accounts and getting all of his online affairs in order. Most of the information is on his 2008 Macbook Pro running 10.8.3. He also has a iPad 2, iPhone and mac mini. In a rush to get into his system to access his facebook and quotes for upcoming jobs to pass the word of his passing I cleared out his login password. I haven't used a Mac in a long time, so I followed a guide that instructed me to go into single user mode, delete something and when the machine rebooted it allowed me to make a account and remove his login password.

Now I believe I need access to his keychain for accessing his email account to start closing accounts and such. The only options I am given is to make a new keychain that will delete it and make a new keychain, or link the new password to the keychain. Here is my problem, if I try and link the new password it asks for the original password.

I found some program that could find out what the user password is, but now that does me no good because it just gives me the new password that I made.

Can someone please help. I am at my wits end. Is there anyway to un-reset his login password or any other way that I can get in there. Any help would be great.

[Update 1]: Oh yea, on top of everything else all of his stuff is linked to his .me email address and he doesn't have that email setup on the phone or ipad where I have access to his email account. If it wasn't for that I could at-least send reset request and work my way back from there. If I was to supply Apple with his death certificate do you think there is anything they could do for me? I could care less about the apps or music that he purchased, but I just need more access so I can finish with all of his affairs.

[Update 2]: I called Applecare because the battery in it was also swollen and popped out of the lower cover. The person on the phone told me to go to Keychain and reset it. Not sure if this will fix it of not but the woman on the phone said they will replace the battery for me and she was so very kind.

1Password: Stores passwords, not a huge fan, but just started using it. Once all my passwords are saved I can see it being beneficial. Installed on iOS as well.

Adapter: Converts audio and video to a lot different formats.

Photoshop: Photo editor and creator. Used for almost 10 years, to stubborn to try a new one.

Aggregator: Sorts files to folders by filetype. Useful if you have an extremely messy folder like my dropbox gets to be.

AirParrot: AirPlay to a receiver. Does the screen at anytime, not just for video or music.

Alfred 2 (w/PowerPack): Easy file and task launcher. Workflows let you add appointments, reminders, google search, ect. from anywhere.

AppyDays: Find daily deals on Apps

AppZapper: Completely remove an app and it's hidden files

Bartender: Hides some of the menu bar items I don't use frequently to a sub-menu bar

BBEdit: Formerly my Markdown wordpad, currently trying out Ulysses 3

Bodega: App store, not regulated by Apple

BusyCal: More features than the stock OSX calendar.

Caffeine: Simple menu-bar do not sleep activator 

CandyBar: Tool to change app icons

CheatSheet: Hold CMD and all the keystroke shortcuts for an app appear

CleanMyMac2: The best file cleaner for mac. My measurement involves running one cleaner and then opening another to see how much space it can clean instantly after. CleanMyMac2 won by a long shot over MacKeeper.

Cloud Clip: Clipboard manager, works flawlessly with the iOS app

CloudPlay: Make playlists from youtube and other media sources to play.

I am running 10.8.3 and have a Cannon MFC8380 laser printer. On a regular basis when attempting to print, the print job will queue up into the spooler and the job will become paused with the RESUME option becoming available. Selecting the RESUME option will not provide satisfaction and no job gets printed.

I have had the same results regardless of weather I setup the printer via USB (MacBook directly) or try to access via ethernet (wired from router, Cisco E2000).

On various occasions I have removed the printing system (holding option while selecting the ""-"" on Print &amp; Scan in System Prefs) and added the printer again. Some of the times this has worked for awhile but within a few print jobs I am back to the job stalling in the queue and the RESUME button becoming available but with no success.

So this problem is intermittent. But mostly a situation with no printing.

I also have a MacMini (current generation) which has no problem printing the same jobs to the same printer via ethernet. While illogical, I even setup the Mini to share the printer (even though the device shares itself). The MacBook Pro R will find the printer itself and the published Mini share, I can setup the printer on the MacBook Pro R but still most of the times I send a job it merely winds up in the queue on the MacBook Pro R.

My last thought was to reinstall OS X on the MacBook Pro R from the restore system on the SSD (holding Command R while restarting). This will provide me with an option to reinstall the system software but when I go any further I am told that my installed OS (the active 10.8.3) is newer than the restore files so I cannot proceed.

Based on the fact that the printer works fine from the Mini running the same version of the 10.8.3 I am assuming I have a software issue on the MacBook Pro R but I can't reinstall my 10.8.3 from restore.

Hope I didn't leave out any information. Any ideas where I go from here?

Recently I realized I can sell it or trade it for a Macbook Pro, which is what I've wanted for the longest time...(and would enable me to use xcode).
So far im pretty stuck on my thinkpad because of how easy it is to type, the fingerprint reader and how fast everything is. The battery lasts me a good 4 hours and the laptop is just great overall.
However the limited experience I've had with macbooks has also all been good, and has the added advantage of looking sleek and sexy, and running both OSX and Win7...

So help me out reddit.
I know that the Macbook can handle pretty much anything I throw at it program-wise, (including Revit, AutoCad and CS5) and even gaming and especially different IDE's for programming.


Should I stick with my thinkpad or move on to a Macbook Pro?
What're the pros and cons, and what would I be missing out on if I stick with my thinkpad?
Thanks guys!
and heres the specs of my laptop:

i7-2620M Processor, Dual core with Hyperthreading. 2.7GHz with 3.2GHz Turboboost.

8GB DDR3 RAM, 1333MHz

Edit: wow thanks for all the replies! Looks like its a pretty heated debate between the two but I'm slightly leaning towards a Mac.

**BACKGROUND**

I have a large library of well tagged ALAC (lossless) music ripped from thousands of CDs.

I took the plunge from Sonos into iTunes and Apple a few years ago because iTunes was stable, I had an iPhone, and AirPlay, Remote, and Home Sharing seemed appealing.  I wanted to have everything under one umbrella, but with Sonos for example I couldn't rate a song I was listening to because playing was separate from library management.

But all this Apple music stuff is a joke -- features checked off a list that don't really work in the real world.  Home Sharing loses 90% of my collection all the time forcing me to deactivate and reactivate it (of course having to type my password in again every time).  Remote never provides UI feedback so I end up tapping, retapping, sliding volume 5 times before it responds.  AirPlay is inconsistent and locks up the UI for seconds at a time and requires deactivating/reactivating... I came from Sonos where all this stuff ""just worked"".

And even the basic desktop iTunes app, don't get me started... Every version of iTunes that comes out seems to have fewer features and in more cumbersome places, dumbed down for the moms and dads getting their first computer.  The views are oversimplified, and in the latest version they eliminated the ability to even have more than 1 window open at once which makes building playlists very difficult.  I could go on...

But bitter rambling aside, the question is:  Is there any modern media player and management software for OS X that can handle managing and playing a large collection of structured lossless data?  I found a thread from a few years back, and everything recommended there is no longer being developed.

Some features on my wishlist:
 - browsing by album art
 - support for multiple genre tags
 - support for multiple artist tags
 - good playlist management
 - import/export data (including playlists) from/to iTunes

And ideally it would work with AirPlay and Remote (since I have those set up already), but these may be closed to 3rd party software, I don't know.

If nothing exists, I'm thinking of creating something (but hoping I don't have to).  Would anybody be interesting in working on a project like this?

(Using MacBook6,1 Late-2010, OS X 10.8.4)

After following many tutorials and attempting to fix the contents of BootCamp to allow my mac to create a USB boot disk to run windows, I always came to failure. 
The fix was meant to add an option to BootCamp to create the disk for you, an option only given to Macs with an Optical Drive. However one simple fix allowed me to gain this option in BootCamp. The following is the complete set of instructions which brought me to success.

1) Right click ""open package contents"" Applications&gt;Utilities&gt;Boot Camp Assistant.

2) Create a duplicate of info.plist and save to desktop. Rename original as infoOLD.plist.

3) Open info.plist with a text editor. Locate the sections where the model identifiers are listed (I had three). Open ""About This Mac"", and open ""System Report"".

4) For my system the content of &lt;strings&gt;&lt;/strings&gt; are written using the model identifier found in the system report. Other tutorials listed the content as the first 4 symbols of the Boot Rom Version (i.e. MB61 for MacBook6,1). Add a &lt;string&gt;MODEL_IDENTIFIER&lt;/string&gt; where model identifier is required, but only in the same style as the content for the other strings in that section.(eg. add &lt;string&gt;MacBook6,1&lt;/string&gt; if the others are in that style or &lt;string&gt;MB61&lt;/string&gt; alternatively).

5) My info.plist had a section called PreUSBSupportedModels, and this was the clincher for me, change this to USBSupportedModels, and along with the other additions you make, save to the Package folder, then reload BootCamp Assistant. Then follow Boot Camps instructions.

My users all think the conference rooms get shitty reception, but in reality the conference rooms have plenty of coverage. It just sucks for them because when they leave their desk to go into a conference room, they're still talking to the AP near their desk.

Is it possible to tune how aggressively Mac OS reassociates, or do I just have to tell them to turn wifi off and back on whenever this happens?

**EDIT: Thanks for the tips, everyone. Looks like I need to tinker with WLC settings.**",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,1374012024.0,,,True,t3_1ifpkh,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1ifpkh/mac_os_not_switching_aps_aggressively_enough/,

I was hoping that the iCloud photo stream would work out of the box, but alas it requires you to install either iPhoto or Aperture. Aperture is much too expensive, I don't snap that many photos and I don't need whatever features in there.

Is iPhoto any good? I mean, if I were in a desperate need of the photo stream I would have already purchased it, but as I can easily import the photos from my iPhone when I connect I'm debating whether it's nice to have or not.

EDIT: I ended up purchasing iPhoto. It's awesome, even if you're only casually photo things while out for a walk/on a vacation/etc.",,False,self,t5_2qh4u,1374576319.0,,,True,t3_1hzw62,http://www.reddit.com/r/mac/comments/1hzw62/is_iphoto_worth_it/,
