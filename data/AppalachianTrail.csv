In the weeks of research before that, I spent a lot of time browsing the Whiteblaze forums and this subreddit, being a redditor. You might remember these topics I've created:

[Help a Dutch guy out: Deciding on a route](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/19mvwr/help_a_dutch_guy_out_deciding_on_a_route/)

[The first thing you got rid of once you started the trail?](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/1awzcx/the_first_thing_you_got_rid_of_once_you_started/)

The whole experience was fantastic and went way beyond my expectations. As my flair indicates, the plan was to walk to Damascus but that was a bit too optimistic. I decided to stop in Erwin instead, a decision I don't regret at all. A week more and I would have been able to make it.

During the trip, two major problems appeared: a blocked creditcard which forced me to take a few zero days in Hiawassee, and a pair of feet with serious blisters caused by wearing the wrong shoes. The first problem was solved by calling my bank and activating my Maestro/Cirrus card, which was set to 'Europe' instead of 'Worldwide'. I thought I had solved the problem by buying new shoes at the Three Eagles Outfitter, but in fact, those shoes only made it worse. Thinking it was just the 'brake in phase', I walked the next days all the way to Franklin only to return them in their other Three Eagles Outfitter store. Once they saw my ruined feet, they made sure to replace them with some awesome Merrell Barefeet shoes (vibram soles) which made my blisters go away in the next few days.

I've met over 50 people on the trail, all with the same kind of love for nature and hiking. I felt completely at home, meeting new people everyday. The southern hospitality along the trail was something that surprised me as well, with people giving me food and drinks on numerous accounts of trail magic (9 bags of Mountain House dinners in one case in Fontana) and the rides people were offering me to the nearby towns. I learned what I was capable of, and walked a total of 332 miles which is a nice average of about 10 miles a day (including the forced zero days). It was also nice to spend some time in Atlanta as well, I got there by Greyhound. (Erwin &gt; Johnson City &gt; Knoxville &gt; Atlanta).

Once again, thanks for the help I've received over here that made me more prepared. I'll continue to help others out as well!",,False,,t5_2stbz,False,,,True,t3_1dvhdf,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/1dvhdf/just_returned_from_the_at_thanks_rappalachaintrail/,

So I started hiking the 10 miles back to the trailhead at Fontana dam, and a few miles away felt so weak and in pain that I just ditched my pack and all my equipment because I was genuinely afraid I wasn't going to make it out of there alive.

I finally got to the trailhead, got a ride to Fontana village, and from there am ambulance to Bryson City Hospital, where they diagnosed kidney stones, and then I peed them out 10 minutes before I was to be discharged. (My only luck yesterday)

So now I'm in a motel room recuperating, my pack sitting in the woods, and a couple of stones still need to come out. The ranger station is going to try and send a ridgerunner to grab my pack today, so I hope it's still there.

Ah.

* **AN ABRIDGED HISTORY**

The Appalachian Trail is a 2,181 mile continuous scenic trail that spans from Springer Mountain in northern Georgia all the way up to Mt. Katahdin in Maine's Baxter State Park. It was started in the 1920s by a guy named Benton MacKaye, and finished in the early 30s by Myron Avery, who became the first man to hike the entire thing, though not in one season. That was first done in 1948 by a WW2 vet and total badass named Earl Shaffer. He was a baller.  Nobody believed him when he claimed that he had done the entire thing at once, because that's fucking crazy. But he did, and he set the tradition of going northbound from Georgia to Maine, the reverse of the Trail's official route. Since then some other notable folks have hiked it and some other stuff has happened and you can read about all of it on Wikipedia.


* **GEOGRAPHY**

The AT passes through, going north, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. The respective states, for the most part, have a pretty distinct feel to them and vary largely in difficulty. For instance, I hiked nearly all of Maryland in one day because Maryland is really goddamned easy, whereas in southern Maine I'd do 12 mile days and be exhausted because Maine just wants to kill you.

The southern terminus of the Trail is on little Springer Mountain, while the northern terminus is on kickass Mt. Katahdin.  90% of people who attempt to thru-hike (hiking the trial end to end in less than a year) begin in Georgia in Spring and go north. These sexy people are called northbounders, or NOBOs. The other 10% are weirdos we like to call SOBOs, or dirty sou-bounders.

The trail is pretty rough from Georgia all the way through Tennessee, with a whole lot of up and down (not nearly as much as, say, New Hampshire, but still not the easiest part by far). And if you start in March, like it did, it's still really goddamned cold in the southern mountains. I had a 15 degree bag and I was still really cold some nights in the Smokies. It started warming up in Tennessee, but I didn't send my cold weather gear home until southern Virginia.

Everything becomes instantly better in Virginia, when you come down from the hill-people-infested, privyless mountains of Tennessee and into the wonderful town of Damascus, VA, home to the annual hikerpalooza festival, Trail Days. Southern and central Virginia is full of great towns and great trail, and the climbs start being concentrated into big two- or three-thousand footers followed by miles of flat ridge-walking. Once you hit the Shenandoahs, it all gets really, really flat pretty much until the end of Massachusetts.

The only thing really notable, geographically, until then is the state of Pennsylvania. It gets a lot of hate but I didn't mind it all that much, because it is really flat. The reason it gets so much hate are the rocks. So many rocks. And poison ivy. There are miles of Pennsylvania that are just a big game of The Floor Is Lava where you have to hop across rocks or else walk through poison ivy. That's half of Pennsylvania, and the other half is farm valleys, which are really nice and flat and really pretty although sometimes they smell like shit.

Once you hit Vermont, you're back in the mountains. Vermont is hilly and really, really muddy, but full of super nice people and it's really easy to get a hitch. After you leave Vermont and head into New Hampshire, you hit the Whites. A lot of people say this is the hardest part of the trail, but I disagree. The Whites are tough, definitely, and are run by the Appalachian Mountain Club, a private organization that doesn't give one single fuck about thru-hikers, but they're really amazing to hike through. You're climbing some big, big mountains (including Mt. Washington, where we summitted in 90 mph wind), but you're above the tree line so much that it makes for some really astounding views.

Then you get into Maine, which is the most beautiful state on the trail but the one that also most wants to kill you. Southern Maine is really, really hard. It wants you to die. But once you get through there and into Monson and the 100 Mile Wilderness, it's smooth sailing all the way to Katahdin, the only mountain on the trail that's not part of a range, and the biggest sustained climb of the entire journey.


* **PREPARATION**

""Oh shit,"" you say, ""I don't have any hiking experience! There's no way I can do this!""

But that's bullshit. I'd never hiked further than 60 miles in one trip before starting this trail. It helps to physically prepare yourself by running and working out your core, shoulders, and legs, but the only thing that can prepare you for long-distance hiking is long-distance hiking. Despite what some more elitist hikers say, you can hike yourself into shape. The AT is, by far, less of a physical challenge than a mental one.

That said, it is physically challenging and you should be alright with that. The best piece of advice I ever got from a former thru-hiker at the beginning of my hike was this: *You are going to be in pain every single day.* The location of the pain is going to change, but you will hurt every day. And that's true, but if you can come to terms with that and just keep going, then that's one major mental challenge overcome.

I didn't do too much planning, leaving about a month after I decided to quit my job and do it, but a lot of people schedule out their entire trip, shelter to shelter. I think that's pretty silly, but I knew some people who actually did stick to it completely. If that's the sort of thing you're into, go for it. But flexibility, I think, is a major virtue on the trail. I only had short-term schedules, drawn from data in my guidebook, which had mileages and shelter locations. I used the ATC's Thru-Hiker's Companion, but I recommend AWOL's AT Guide.

As for your budget, if you already have gear plan on about $3,000. It's possible to do it on as little as $1,500, but you'll be living a very Spartan life. You will really want beers when you hit towns, I promise.

A couple months back, I [posted](http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/13zrow/a_new_kind_of_trail_guide/) about a project that I was working on (www.wikitrail.org).  The idea of the project is to put AT trail data online in a format that is accessible to everyone - and can be easily updated whenever the trail changes.

I had to let the project sit for a while (b/c I was on the road, without the time or internet connection needed to do any more work), but over the last few weeks, I've had a chance to add a bunch of stuff that I hope will make the site more useful:

* I've added a ton of new data, and it's all been converted from the 2011 numbers to 2013.  Before, it was just shelters, POs, towns and most of the hostels.  Now, it's got almost all of the important stuff.  I'm sure there are a bunch of things I missed.  If so, these can easily be added.  It's got everything I think you would need to hike the trail.  I'd test it myself, but that'll have to wait until next time!
* I've added trail maps to the PDF guides.  I wanted to get this in when I first posted the site, but I was having some issues with the google maps API.  That's fixed now.  So, now you can see how the trail looks without needing an internet connection.  Take a look at the guide for the [Neels Gap to Hiawassee section](http://www.wikitrail.org/sections/pdf/at/3002?size=mobile).  (There are PDF guides for each of the ""sections"" of the trail as well as a PDF for the whole trail - found on the [AT page](http://www.wikitrail.org/trails/view/at/appalachian-trail).) 
* I've added some stats to the site.  Using the elevation profile data, I calculated the elevation gain/loss along the trail, which also gives you the trail grade as well.  So, now, at a glace you can get a rough idea of the difficulty of each section of the trail (and, yes, I know, there's more to trail difficulty than just the grade).
* I've also built a pretty basic 'planner' to help estimate how long your hike will take and when you'll be at various places along the trail.  I got the idea from http://www.pctplanner.com/, which someone mentioned when I posted about this last time, but I've tweaked it quite a bit.  [Give it a shot](http://www.wikitrail.org/planner/new/at).

I think this can be a really useful tool for people preparing for the trail as well as people already in the middle of a hike.  Pretty much anything on the trail can be reviewed by users - water sources, shelters, hostels, towns, sections of the trail.  Water source dry?  Say so, and future hikers will know not to rely on that water source.  Great experience at a trail hostel?  Leave a review, and let your fellow hikers know.

I've put A LOT of time into this project - WAY more than I was planning on.  Once I got started, though, I had to see it all the way through.  I've enjoyed building it and I've learned a bunch of stuff along the way, but I'd hate it if all of this work were to go to waste.  Please, take a look at what I've built. Tell me what you think (as long as it's constructive, thank you).  If you like it, tell your AT friends.  And, if you're leaving for the trail soon, consider taking the PDF guides on your phone/kindle - can't hurt to have a backup guide!

Thanks for looking!

The only advice I would give is:

1) Carry a light pack. If don't think you need something, you don't.  But it is easy to send stuff home.  In the beginning many hikers carry too much food. I did this myself.  I started with more than 5 days of food! Don't do that!

2) Take it slow, at first.  Lots of people drop out early on because they pushed too hard.  Don't worry about the miles early on.  Just take it easy and let yourself fall into the rhythm.

This could be (and probably is) easily abused so I strongly discourage doing this unless you have a legitimate gear failure, but if you're a thruhiker and have a gear failure, whether its your pack, tent, sleeping bag, trekking poles, boots, or whatever, call up the manufacturer, make sure to mention that you're an AT THRUHIKER, currently in (city, state) and that your stuff broke.

The last thing any of the big names in the outdoor gear industry wants is a thruhiker out there with broken gear, talking about how the products suck.  They will either ask you where you want your free replacement product shipped (and they will ship General Delivery to a PO) or they will tell you where the next authorized retailer is located near the trail so that you can take it there and have it exchanged.  (They typically always want the bad product returned.)

I did this when my Granite Gear pack started tearing in PA.  Another friend had his boots replaced by Merrell because of delamination on the toes, and I saw countless Leki poles repaired and replaced.  So keep a list of the 800 numbers to all your gear manufacturers in your guidebook just in case.

I'm interested in seeing how my list stacks up to other thru-hikers, this post can also give the 2012'ers some highlights of each state section!

Put yours in order from 1 (favorite) to 13 (least favorite) with some highlights of each state. For the sake of argument, lets have NC/TN combined as one since most of the trail is on the border there anyway.


Wobegon's List:

1. **Maine.** 
    A fantastic and eerie finale to my thru-hike. Southern Maine (especially the section between Stratton and Rangeley) I believe is the toughest section of the whole Trail, but is extremely beautiful. Highlights for me were: Katahdin (of course), The Hundred Mile Wilderness, blueberries, moose, awesome swimming, pancakes at Pierce Pond, the White Wolf Burger in Stratton (don't attempt the challenge)

2. **New Hampshire.**
For the northbounder, Mt. Moosilauke marks our first taste of the alpine zone, and wasn't it AMAZING!?! My fiance and I also spotted our first moose of the trip in the meadow just before the mountain. The Whites are difficult but a highlight of anyone's trip. Highlights: Mt. Washington, Mt. Moosilauke, Hanover

3. **Virginia**
    Try to avoid the ""blues"" and Virginia is a lovely state. On my NOBO hike, I first hit a ""wall"" so to speak physically, but then as I continued to monitor my calorie intake better, I flourished as a hiker. So much to see, considering nearly 1/4th of the trail is in this state. Highlights: gorging myself in Shenandoah Nat'l Park, ponies at the Grayson Highlands, The Priest, Ming's Buffet in Waynesboro

4. **Vermont**
    After I got out of the very muddy section just across the border, I really liked Vermont. Highlights: Green Mountain House Hostel, Mt. Killington, the Long Trail Inn.

5.  **Georgia**
Great southern hospitality, I wish to hike this section again not in the winter of March! Highlights: Blueberry Patch Hostel, Blood Mountain

6. **North Carolina/Tennessee**
    I was still learning at this point, (weren't we all, nobos?) but my trip through the Smokies was overall enjoyable. Highlights: Kincora Hostel, Charlies Bunion and the rest of the Smokies, Watuaga Dam, Standing Indian Mountain.

7. **Massachusetts**
    Northbounders are eager to finally have reached NEW ENGLAND! It was quite muddy when I was there, but I enjoyed Mass. Highlights: Tom Levardi, Mt. Greylock.

8. **West Virginia**
    Sure, you're not in WV for very long, but Harper's Ferry is one of the most historic spots in the East and the ATC is a great ""psychological midpoint"" of the trek. Also an easy train trip into Washington DC.

9.  **New York**
    The deli-to-deli hike was in full swing by the time we were all in the Empire State. AMAZING. Highlights: Bear Mountain, huge sandwiches, train station into Manhattan.

10.  **Maryland**
    Awesome Civil War history and easy trail. Another highlight is fantastic shelters.

11.  **New Jersey**
    Brink Road Shelter I believe has the absolute worst mosquitoes of anywhere in the country I have ever been, and I've been to the Boundary Waters in Northern Minnesota a few times. I also hated that 2 square mile swamp section considering it was over 100 degrees. Yikes. Highlights: lots of bears, High Point State Park, church hostel in Vernon, Sunfish Pond.

12. **Pennsylvania**
    Oh, PA. How (nearly) everyone hated you. The place where boots go to die. Ankle-breaking fields of rocks as far as you can see. Climb up on a ridge, trip over rocks for miles, go down the ridge to a road, repeat. I believe the local section hikers there are masochists. Some highlights though: The Doyle, half-gallon challenge, lovely shelters (when there is water, which in summer can be rare).

13. **Connecticut**
    Where hiker trash meets yuppie richies! The two major trail towns, Salisbury and Kent clearly (from my own perspective of course) want nothing to do with us. Enjoy being yelled at by the lady at the Kent Laundromat and the particularly strange looks at the supermarket. Highlights: Lion's Head.

But always make sure your furry friend is on a leash. I had an incident on the CT section of the AT a week ago involving someone's off-leash dog. I was solo section hiking, and this large, athletic dog came bounding through the woods towards me. I'm not a big person, and I couldn't outrun the dog, so I turned myself so it jumped on my backpack and not at my face. There were several moments where I was unsure whether the dog was just being an enthusiastic dog or if it was attacking me. No one goes hiking thinking, 'Gee, I hope this hike includes fighting off an animal.'

Good news: the dog turned out to be friendly, calmed down, and was able to hike with me for a couple hours. She was able to be returned to the owner via calling the cell number on the dog's collar.

Bad news: I was not the first hiker this dog harassed. There were at least three other hikers I encountered who saw this dog and had similar experiences with it. These experiences were NOT positive, even if these people loved dogs -- and despite the dog ultimately being friendly. The one woman was hiking with her dog, and she had the biggest problem with encountering this energetic dog because it really upset her own (leashed) dog. The owner, btw, turned out to be day hiking some thirty miles behind where the dog was found.

It was quite a bit less social, as there were a lot fewer people doing it, but trail magic has absolutely nothing on river magic.

Everybody had these ideas in their heads about how dangerous it would be, but it never seemed to be dangerous at all, with the exception of a few spots of high barge traffic past Baton Rouge.  The killer was the lack of current and you have to paddle into the wind 9 days out of 10.  Ugh.  Many days I felt it was physically harder than hiking, and for me it was mentally harder as well.

It's a basic app I created to get accurate forecasts based on which mile or shelter you're at without having to deal with bloated and ad ridden commercial apps which I found difficult to use on the trail. Basically, you don't need to waste battery waiting for a GPS lock, or manually enter a zip code or nearby town to find the forecast.

The app uses an incredibly small amount of data to get forecasts so it's decently speedy even in poor coverage and 2g networks of mountain towns.

It's free, so check it out, leave some feedback if you wish.

How likely am I to find any thru-hikers spending the night at a shelter on that part of the trail around this time of year?

It looks like input generated from the initial posting of it in there has petered out, so I'm posting the draft here in it's own thread to get wider feedback. 

I've taken a pass through it to try to organize it and to pare it down somewhat.  We were up over 6000 words at one point, which may be overkill for an FAQ. 

It is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZLUW_250GtbnSF0Az2va_2plwiKSRkvKMZ5idykBm-M/edit) as a google doc that anyone can add to or edit. 

So, what did we miss?  What did we babble on too long about?  If we've missed a topic that should be covered, feel free to add it yourself, or just post a suggestion here. The general idea it to keep it introductory and basic, to leave any in-depth discussions and questions for here in the subreddit.

[The story is here.](http://www.northboundjourney.com/2013/03/30/day-12-salsa/)  From what I understand, she is chipped and they have alerted the locals, but she still hasn't been found.  Help Reddit!  What can I do to help?!?

**Edit**: She was last seen near the 100 mile mark/Albert Moutain area in North Carolina.  They hiked to Rock Gap Shelter that day and were looking for her near Betty Creek.  After days of searching, they continued hiking, hoping that Salsa would find them somehow.  Thanks for your help and input! 

**Edit #2**: A camper thought he might have heard a dog near Carter Cap Shelter, the last place they stayed before she was lost.  They left contact information at Nantahala Ranger Station if anyone sees her.

I'm going to be thru hiking NOBO this March and I'm super excited... but my parents still aren't. I'm a 19 year old female who will be hiking alone. From doing tons of research on this subreddit, whiteblaze, and trailjournals.com I have a pretty good sense of how safe the trail is. I'm going to always be careful and cautious: never hitch alone, never tell a stranger I'm alone (tell them I've got friends coming up behind me or something), don't stick around anyone who makes me uncomfortable, etc. From what I've heard, I don't expect to have much of a problem feeling unsafe or threatened, especially because I plan to make friends and form a hiking group pretty quickly.


I'm having some trouble convincing my parents that I won't get abducted or murdered out there though. Can you guys help me out with some anecdotal evidence of how safe the trail is? And any other safety tips would be appreciated as well. 


Here are some things I'd appreciate you speaking about from personal experience:

-number of people at shelters every night (I plan on sleeping in or near shelters for the most part), especially for a nobo leaving in March

-general kindness of thru hikers and sense of community between hikers

-your experience making friends and finding hiking partners if you started out alone (or even if you didn't)

-any emergencies you heard about or witnessed on trail (ex: someone getting hurt and needing help)

So what was your lowest point on the AT? How did you cope with it? What did you take away from the experience?  

My lowest point was probably during the last few days before I summitted.  I sliced my wrist open on a rock night-hiking into the hundred mile wilderness, so that sort of set the tone for the next few days--initially I saw it as a race to Katahdin against infection. 

I went into the hundred mile knowing I was going to come out very hungry, and I was right.  

It all came to a head at Rainbow Lake, where I got maybe an hour or two of sleep because the mosquitos were relentless.  When I did fall asleep I woke myself up a few times because I was on mosquito-attack-autopilot and I managed to slap myself awake.  

I made it to Abol Bridge hungry and haggard, where I found out I was pretty much out of money. Thankfully my buddy helped me out, but that was a solid ego blow on top of everything else. 

But I was also only 15 miles from Katahdin at that point, and I knew what I had to do to get there.  So I just said fuck it and walked. It was all completely worth it. Can't wait for the next long distance hike.

I settled on thru-hiking the AT early this year. I'm just about down to 5 months to go 'til my departure date. Getting pumped, doing some training, but now it's time to really get my gear finalized....and I'm a bit overwhelmed by the market selection. I'm trying my best to go Ultra Light. I've bought my sleeping gear (this is the one category where I'm allotting more weight than an UL hiker would normally - If I don't sleep well I don't think I stand much of a chance making to to Maine) : 

* Big Agnes Roxy Ann 15 degree womens petite bag and Big Agnes Insulated Air Core (the pad slides into the bag, together they total 67 oz)

I've also bought my cookware:

* MSR Pocket Rocket Stove (3oz), Titanium pot w/lid, cup and spork (don't have the exact weight for these but they are *light*), and will use an 8oz IsoPro fuel canister.

I've also bought some of my clothes, hiking poles, little gear items and have decided on buying a SteriPen for water purification. What I'm having trouble deciding on is my shelter, shoes and bag. 

SHELTER - For a while I was considering a bivy tarp combo for shelter but the more I think about being in the tight quarters of a bivy for 6 months (especially in the summer!) the more I am leaning to getting an UL tent. Right now the Shangra-La 1 with bug nest is on the top of my list. It gives me so many options for such little weight (just over 2 lbs for the tarp, bug nest w/floor, and stakes). I can use the whole combo, just the tarp, or just the bug nest for when it's hot as balls. I guess I'm pretty sold, but I am looking for real peoples experiences with the tent and other possible options before I splurge. 

SHOES - I have heavy duty hiking boots, but I really can't stand the weight and confinement (I usually only wear sandals and Vibram FiveFingers). I would love to take my Sport Treks but on long distance hikes they KILL my little toes. Can anyone recommend light to mid weight shoes in a reasonable price range, about $100 or less that could stand up to the AT?

BAG - This is going to be the last thing I buy to assure that I don't get one too big or too small. I want something light, with built in suspension, and preferably a bottom compartment for my sleeping bag. Again, any recommendations, advice, etc.?

Sorry this post has gotten quite long! Any input would be Much Appreciated! Happy Trails!

EDIT: I've decided against the SteriPen and plan on using AquaMira.

Sometimes, water sources were dry.  Sometimes, businesses had gone out of business.  Sometimes, the elevations or distances were off.  This wasn't a huge deal if you had met a hiker coming from the other direction and you could ask about conditions up ahead - but what if you didn't?

Right now, you've pretty much got two options for trail guides: AWOL's guide and the Companion.  Both come out once a year, both have errors and both cost money. 

It's 2012 - almost 2013!  Why are we still relying on these paper-based, once-a-year, maintained-by-one-person guides?  Can't we just combine what we all know about the trail to create a single, authoritative guide to the trail?  How about something that's easily accessible - i.e. something your friends and family can use to follow you along your hike?

So, I thought I would try to build something myself.  Here it is: [wikitrail.org](http://www.wikitrail.org/trails/view/at/appalachian-trail)  I called the site wikitrail because it's content comes from its users and everything can be edited.

At the moment, I've added all of the shelters, POs, some of the hostels and some of the more major road crossings.  If this site is going to be as useful as either of the guides already in use, it's going to need a lot more content (esp. water sources and town info).  I'm going to keep adding more information to the trail, but if this site is going to sustain itself, then it's going to need input from other people too.  Also, my data comes from 2011 with a few edits based on my experience this summer - so, if you see anything out of date in what I've added, please feel free to fix it.  

If things go well, I would love to expand the site to include other trails like the PCT, CDT and Camino de Santiago.  Guides for those trails are either super-inaccurate, expensive or non-existent.

So what do you think, reddit?  Is this the kind of thing that would work well with crowd-sourcing, or are people happy with the traditional system?

I hike often, and have done several multi-day hikes by myself; Still, friends and relatives seem to have some concerns about through-hiking alone, so I told thought I'd ask you guys:

* Do many people start alone? approximately what is the percentage?
* I've understood that people tend to form groups, how easy is this? and is it common.
* Other than common sense things, are there things that someone hiking alone shouldn't do that people hiking in groups can do?
* What are the odds of a person hiking alone, ending up in some sort of trouble (for example: sprained/broken ankle) where he won't be able to reach help? whereas a partner would be there and able to help? Sorry if this is vague, what I'm trying to ask is: is there a chance that I'll break an ankle and no one will be around for days to help me?
* Is it worth it to get one of those emergency locator beacons?

Also, a gear question

* Is it feasible to take a sleeping bag rated around ~35F and a liner, and once the weather warms up just use the sleeping bag instead of switching?

Thanks! looking forward to seeing everybody on the trail.

We parked my car at the Lehigh Gap Nature Center, located at the lehigh water gap.  We had a friend drop us off at PA 309, about 13 miles away.  The road rises up to meet the trail, so there was no initial uphill hike to get onto the trail.  The first several miles were all flat and wide, perfect for inexperienced hikers to get their footing.  There was some rock scrambling at the knife's edge and bake oven knob, but it was still fairly easy.  We stayed at the bake oven knob shelter overnight, which was about 6 miles from our start.  Next day we hiked out to the nature center at the water gap.  This day was a little over 7 miles, had less rocks and was mostly downhill all day.

Am I crazy?,,18,5,23,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/x257w/fantasizing_about_hiking_the_at_in_2013_am_i_crazy/,"After doing a day hike of a short section of the Appalachian Trail recently and talking to a few thru-hikers on the way, I've gotten really buzzed about the idea of doing a thru-hike myself. I've spent a good amount of time reading up on the trail and thru-hiking, and everything I see just gets me more excited about the idea. 

I was thinking that I would put it off for years, but as I'm graduating from college this winter, I've been realizing that there's no telling how long it will be before I have another opportunity to do something nuts like this, and whether I'll still be in the right frame of mind to accomplish it. Lately I've been so caught up in what I should do with my life after I graduate, and this is the first idea I've seen which has really inspired me. 

My main worry is that I have very little backpacking experience right now. I've been on quite a few mountainous day hikes before, but I've only ever done one overnight backpacking trip in a group. I've always loved it, of course, but I know hiking two days is a far cry from hiking 6 months. 

I don't think any of my good friends would be up to do this, so I'll likely be setting out alone. What sort of experience should I get in order to make sure that starting the AT alone won't be a disaster? Would a week-long backpacking trip be enough practice to feel safe on the trail? (I figure this would also be smart since I sure as hell can't do the AT if I can't make it through a week's hike.) I'm just trying to figure out whether this is a pipe dream or a real feasible thing that I could do.

I was wondering if anybody wouldn't mind answering some questions that have been bugging me:

1. If you start off in Georgia in March, I'd imagine that many of you had to deal with snow and freezing temperatures. How do your feet stay warm in those conditions if you're hiking in trail runners or hiking shoes? They don't look very warm.

2. If you're walking in the rain and wet conditions, how do you keep your feet dry? Won't your feet get infected and blistered if they stay wet too long?

3. How do you keep your gear dry while hiking in the rain? Do you cover the bag in something while it' son your back?

4. I've noticed many trail meals are fat and carbohydrate laden but are fairly lacking in protein (i.e. pasta sides, granola, etc.). Am I missing something, or do you tend to deprive yourself of protein while hiking? Isn't that detrimental?

5. When you stay at one of the shelters located along the trail, what's the procedure for sleeping? Do you sleep inside the shelter? Do you set up your tent outside the shelter?

6. When you have to leave the trail for a zero day, does it cause a lot of problems to walk into a town smelling and looking the way you do? I understand that a lot of towns are prepared for hikers and wouldn't bat an eye, but it seems some towns, especially in NY, CT and MA, don't really know much about the AT. Do some of the people ever give you trouble?

7. How do you wash your clothes as you go? Do you even wash them?

8. How do you bathe as you go? Do you even bathe?

9. How can you clean your cookware?

10. How do you dry your clothes after they get wet? It seems like people generally recommend you don't make fires while hiking the AT, so I don't know how you'd go about drying your stuff in cold or wet conditions.

I could use some more tips on the trail on just the stuff that no one really thinks about or the guide books just don't say.
I guess I started to get really worried about the whole new permit systetm in the Smokies because the website is not up yet and i dont have a way to print/downlaod my permit if I bought one online and worries about trying to get one in person.
Also its my first time leaving not just the state I live in, but leaving the island I live on. I live in Hawaii on the ""big island"" and my best friend also my A.T. hiking partner have never left our state and I really don't know what to expect on the mainland so i'am really scared about the culture shock because apparently after talking to my friends that left Hawaii for the first time after graduation last year said they expercened a culture shock that is comparable of moving to another country. Not to mention that I have to fly for the first time and change planes and that shit.
I guess I needed just to vent because my family( except for my dad my mom dose not support this because I her only son is leaving for the first time) thinks its a stupid and useless thing to hike the A.T. and my best friend is going to be my hiking partner.

And I suppose the intensity of the coming winter might come into play, as well.

I'm TRYING to it all out, but I just can't decide.  It seems that many hikers start early these days--late feb to mid march.  If I start then, it might be too crowded.  But if I start later, it might not be crowded enough.  I DO want to meet people.  If I wanted to be all alone, I would go to Alaska.  There is also the weather.  An early start promises to get you through the mid-Atlantic before the summer gets too hot and humid. But that can result in very nasty conditions (snow, cold rain) in the southern Appalachians.  And you'll probably miss the fall foliage in New England.  A later start (like April 15th) pretty much guarantees hot and muggy conditions in Penna. and, possibly, a race to make it to Katahdin before the snow starts falling in October.  I would also imagine that if I didn't start until mid-April, I would utterly hate going to work each and every day.  I would be SO itchy to get on the trail.

So I really don't know.  My feeling is that I'll probably want to start sometime between March 15th and April 1sth, but I'm really not sure.  Got a perspective on this issue?  I can say that I would feel very uncomfortable with a February start, and that I wouldn't want to start that deep into April.  Historically, March 1sth, March 15th, March 21st and April 1st are popular starting dates although it seems that people are starting earlier and earlier.  I would like to avoid those exact dates.  Maybe do something like starting someday in March during the middle of the week...

I keep thinking about the Storm of the Century in mid-March of 1993.  If a bad storm happened, I could lose a week of walking (or just move very slowly), which could totally erase the benefits of an earlier start.

In a week I'll be leaving for a hike in the AT from New York state to the New Hampshire-Maine state border. I've planned out all the walking starting with smallish days of 5-10 miles and then averaging 15-20 miles a day after the first week. I've hiked all of Maine on the AT already so I know my capabilities and limits. I've planned it out so that I resupply every two weeks, twice during the whole trip. I'm not into the ultralight hiking deal.

After reviewing details, I'm concerned about the White Mountain range in New Hampshire. I had planned to do about 12 miles a day at most there but seeing that I'm a student and I don't have the cash to pay 100$ for a night in a hut (as opposed to the 8$ a night in campsites/tentsites). I planned the section to be hiked without the use of huts which did leave two days to be quite long, one is supposed to be 19 miles and the other is supposed to be 22 miles in between campsites.

Normally, a 20 mile day wouldn't be a big deal at my pace and I've done them in Maine many times. Except I just read on the AT site that a hiker should only plan 5-8 miles a day in the White Mountain range. I've never done the Whites so I have no experience for that section of trail. I will have about 400 miles of hiking in me by the time I reach them though, if that's a factor.

Weather allowing, I would leave as soon as the sun is up and walk until I reach my destination, stopping only if nature calls and for my official ""lunch"".

I don't know civilian gear at all though. I was thinking about maybe using a medium ALICE pack with civilian straps and pads, but those things get pretty damn uncomfortable after a while.

I saw someone here suggesting the REI Flash 62, but frankly I don't think it's gonna cut it. People are saying it starts to get uncomfortable above 30 lbs, and I plan on carrying at least 40. 80-120 lbs is about what I used to carry back in the army, and 20+ mile hikes in a day weren't unusual. I know rough terrain changes things, so 40 lbs and 3000 cubic inches is about my target.

As far as sleep systems, I'm planning to bring the current generation modular sleep system that the army issues, rated to -50*F. Is that overkill? And with a bivy sack, and shelters along the way, do I really need a tent, or will a tarp and bungie cords cut it for rainy days?

Last question is snow shoes. I have no experience with these. I want to keep my 0 days to a minimum, but reading some other peoples reports, getting snowed in is pretty common during this time of year. Should I start out carrying them, or buy some along the way once I start hitting heavy snow? Or should I just do without and have a few 5 mpd weeks along the way?

This is my first attempt, and it's probably insane, but I'm gonna give it my best shot.

After that, I became fixated on the idea of seeing how far I could go in a ""day"" and started planning for a 24 hr hike.  When I hit Partnership shelter, I had a full moon night and hoped to get to Damascus in 24 hours.  That time I fell a few miles short and ended up doing 58 miles I believe.

I don't have my exact mileage and times documented, but I have photos and timestamps and can try to calculate from those.

It was both of our first time backpacking and first time on the AT. I've car-camped a hundred times before, but I was surprised to find that having everything on your back, and not having a base to return to each night, felt totally different in a good way. I can't even find the words to describe how much we loved it.

Aside from just saying ""woo-hoo!"", I wanted to share the basics of my gear and mention a few things I learned that might be helpful to other newbies like us, and let the more experienced hikers offer any further suggestions.

Big three: REI Flash 62 pack (3lb2oz), REI 55-degree travel sack (1lb11oz), and ALPS Zephyr 1 tent (3lb14oz). Daughter's big three are different but similar in style and weight. Thermarest z-lite pad. Pocket rocket stove and Snow Peak titanium mess kit. Aqua Mira for water purification.

Total pack weight, including 2L of water and (too much) food: 33 lbs.

Things I'd leave out next time: GPS (didn't use it), sunscreen, hat, and sunglasses (didn't use; they might be necessary on more open sections of trail), half of my first-aid kit, trowel (just use a stick or your boot to dig the hole).

Things I'd change:

* Empty Gatorade bottles in place of Nalgenes (1oz vs. 5.6oz); this was the biggest suggestion I got from the thru-hikers we sheltered with.
* Cheap rain poncho in place of nice 1-pound packable raincoat.
* A lighter multi-tool; my Leatherman Wave is just over half a pound.
* Lighter boots. Mine are great for any terrain and any weather, which means they're overkill about 98% of the time, and they weigh almost 5 pounds. Before next time I'll get some trail shoes or something.

That would knock a few pounds off. After that I don't think there's  much to lose without switching out the big three for more ultralight-style gear.

Things I'd add:

* A deck of cards or some kind of game. One thru-hiker I met had a scrabble board drawn on his sleeping pad; presumably he was carrying scrabble tiles. I thought that was cool. If you also drew a checkboard you could use scrabble tiles as checkers too (face-up vs. face-down), and maybe draw chess pieces on the backs of some. In a gift shop I saw a bandana with a checkerboard printed on it.
* A big dry bag in which to hang my food. I used a trash bag I'd brought, but it was a pain and wasn't 100% rainproof.
* Trekking poles. My knees started giving me trouble after we did a 20-mile day with a lot of descents, and I suspect poles might help with that.

I can't wait to do another section. Hopefully someday I can get enough time off to do a longer one, and maybe eventually a thru-hike.",,False,,t5_2stbz,1340375663.0,,,True,t3_vfojf,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/vfojf/first_section_hike_done/,

Anyway, have been thinking about gear since my first long hike on the AT a few years ago could have been better and I want to iron out details ahead of time.

1.  Do you use a tent or hammock?  I want to use a hammock, are they hard to set up on the trail?  Are they worth it?  What kind do you use and what is a decent price for one (with rain fly and netting).

2.  What do you use for water?  I personally have a filter that attaches to the bottles.  Yeah, it's a bit bulky and I could use iodine, but I think its the one thing that I really enjoy having on the trail.  I can get by without most things, but I like my clean water :)

3.  What is your favorite piece of gear that you wouldn't want to live without?  

4.  How many of you fish on the way.  I was thinking it might be fun to bring some line and a couple of hooks.  Not for necessity, but happening to catch a few fish for dinner would be a nice change from the typical food.  I'm not sure where I would dispose of the remains though or where that would be legal.

Since then, I had sort of let it drop out of my mind because I started to make some life plans for next year through the spring, and I figured that I could just think again about doing it in 2014.

Long story short, my life plans for the spring have been falling apart. It looks like if I stick with my current plan, for reasons I won't go into, I'll be hanging around with a fresh engineering degree waiting tables full-time for 6 months. I just can't imagine myself being happy in this situation. I realized a week or so ago that the AT has suddenly again become an incredibly desirable option for my life next year.

However, I'm having trouble mentally committing to it. Doing it will probably require an almost-immediate effort to sublet out my current room (with roommates who I really adore) for the remainder of my lease and find a new place I can live in temporarily, secure a full-time temp job and remain very frugal up until March and possibly take money out of savings, and find a new home for my pet cat.

All of this stuff is doable, and I think it'd be worth it, because hiking the AT is literally the only option I've thought of for my life in the next year that is still plausible and that actually actively excites me. I'm pretty confident that it would be awesome. The stuff I'd be giving up is all nice, but nothing life-changing like this could be.

But I'm still not yet able to shake the voice in my head that's reminding me that it could be terrible. I have visions of myself going, not knowing what I'm doing, not being able to get along with anyone, getting sick of hiking after a week, etc., and dropping out of the trail after having moved heaven and earth to get there. It would be horribly, horribly depressing.

I'm especially worried (while being simultaneously excited) about the social aspect of it. I'd be going alone, and while not a basement dweller by any means, I'm pretty introverted and have trouble with just walking up to people and talking to them. I think it'd be awesome if all goes well and I come up with a great trail family and meet all sorts of wacky new people who are as crazy as I am. I feel like it's also possible I'd work up a bunch of social anxiety when stressed out by my first days on the trail, and then just sort of be scared to talk to anyone, and turn into a miserable loner. I feel like I never hear about this sort of thing, but I still can't shake the image. 

Thru-hikers (prospective and past): How did you guys get over these sorts of anxieties about ""what if it all turns out terrible?"" I feel like I'm one good pep talk away from telling everyone I'm doing it, putting up ads to get rid of my room and my cat, and starting gear hunting. I really want to do this so much and I know that it's in my power, but I just am having trouble working up the nerve.

**Hygiene** - How often did you get a chance to shower or wash during your trip? Even if you only showered every few days, what did you do DAILY to maintain a basic level of cleanliness?

**Medical Issues** - The above question was also due to some mild psoriasis that flares up if I don't get a chance to wash daily. Did you have any medical issues you needed to take care of regularly when hiking, and how did you do it?

**Injuries** - Did you injury yourself at all during your trip? What happened and how did you cope? How long were you off trail if at all? I have an ankle I twisted 4 months back, and it's 95% healed, but it can become a problem quickly again if I'm not careful.

Basically, my dad is an incredibly straight-laced guy with traditional ideas about what makes a person successful. I guess you could say he's like Red Foreman, but without the tender moments. He's not a bad man, but his parenting style isn't very warm. I feel like though I've done my best to live up to his expectations (sometimes to my detriment), I have still been less than successful. I've learned to care a lot less, but his opinion of me still matters.

Anyway, I finally decided it was time to tell him about my hiking plans and he basically told me that it was my life and that's important that I accomplish what I want to accomplish and that I need to do what I think is best for me. It really couldn't have gone better. Although, I know I still have a lot of odds and ends and preparation to do, I can't help but feel that I am a whole lot closer.

So my friend convinced me to go hike part of the AT with him and some other friends. I always wanted to go, but having never gone hiking before, the idea seemed pretty intimidating. Also, I don't like entering a situation without at least a small bit of information, so do you guys have any advice or recommendations for a first time hiker like me?

I don't really know what information might be needed to better provide advice, but the hike is going to be the first week of August, roughly 50-60 miles, and in Tennessee.

Info I am worrying about (you can feel free to talk about whatever you want):  
**Hiking packs**  
  -size  
  -price  
  -material? (idk what defines a good pack vs a bad one)  
  -what to look for  

**Gear**  
-I really have no idea what to buy/bring. Help :'(  

**Clothes**  
  -what's ideal? what's not?  
  -do you bring multiple pairs?  
  -do i need hiking shoes?  

**Food**  
  -what sort of food should I buy and how much?  
  -what sort of equipment do you recommend to prepare the food?  
  -will it taste good?  
  -how do you get water?  

**Technology**  
  -what to bring, what is better left at home  

**Misc**  
  -is there a technique to pooping?  
  -....bears....  
  -do you bring toiletries? deodorant, tooth brush, toilet paper  
  -should i buy a walking stick?  


That's all I can think of right now, please feel free to add any advice you can think of. Thanks!!

edit: wow! thanks for all the detailed answers! Hopefully with the info you guys gave me I won't be totally lost out there. Thank you!!

I got off the trail in early June after going NOBO from Springer to Harpers Ferry. It was mainly to work, although there were some other trail ""vacation"" things involved. I'll be returning to the trail in late July, but I'm not sure where.

Option 1: return to Harper's and hike NOBO. This was the original plan  (saving Katahdin and New England for the glorious end), but I'll be waaaay at the back of the pack and there'll be a serious time crunch to make it to Baxter State Park before the weather deteriorates.

Option 2: Start in Maine, go south. It would be neat to cross paths with everyone I met going NOBO, and I could finish after the Shenandoahs (which I aquablazed).  Also (... I'm just fantasizing at this point because I'm off the trail) potential for a full SOBO thru.

Option 3: meet up with friends who will likely be somewhere in New England and finish the trail in sections. The only reason this is an option is because I LOVE the social aspect of the trail. I've heard that going SOBO is more solitary. It would be a pain to arrange this, though.

Very little has been purchased, but I will be starting that up after getting some feedback here and maybe a similar post to WhiteBlaze.  I am waiting on choosing a pack until I have the majority of my other gear finalized.

- Clothing (everything is listed, including worn clothes).  I don't know the weight on some of these items, either.
 * Shopping boots right now.  I just picked up some Vasque Wasatch GTX.  They felt good at the store, so I am going to take them out and see how I like them.  I am a big guy and sprained my ankle last May, so I am not planning on doing the trail runner thing.
 * Marmot Essence Rain Jacket - 6.0
 * Marmot Precip Rain Pants - 12.0
 * REI Revelcloud Insulated Jacket (with hood) - 12.5
 * Smartwool hiking socks (2 pair)

 * Smartwool long sleeve crew neck t-shirt

 * Smartwool long underwear

**BEST**
(No particular order)


**Shaws/Lake House, Monson ME**
Can't go wrong with either of these places, and you'll probably spend time at both in Monson. Fabulous breakfast at Shaws, tasty ""all you can eat taco"" specials at Lake House (try to beat my record of 21.5 soft beef).

**Green Mountain House, Manchester VT.**
Jeff is a great owner, and goes out of his way to help often. Rides around town, clean sheets and home, great functional kitchen (for when all you want is cooking a huge meal of your own) and most importantly, a free pint of Ben and Jerry's with your stay!

**Kincora Hostel, Hampton TN**
When Bob Peoples goes hiking, mice bring HIM food. A legendary Appalachian Trail haunt that can't be missed on a thru-hike.

**Palmerton ""Jail"" Hostel, Palmerton PA**
The kind people of Palmerton open up the basement of their city borough hall for thru-hikers. No donation necessary and one of the best showers (although that may just be because I was especially stanky) on the whole Trail.

**The AT Lodge, Millinocket Maine**
Either the end or the beginning for many thru-hikers. I spent two great nights there, most of the first day after my thru-hike drinking beer and Jack and Coke and watching copious amounts of Sportscenter. Navi-Gator and Ole Man are great hosts and the Appalachian Trail Cafe was one of my favorite places on the trail.

**Tom Levardi's, Dalton MA**
Not a hostel, but a home in every sense of the word. Levardi is a trail legend for good reason. Another must stay for anyone thru-hiking the AT.







**WORST**


**Pine Ellis, Andover ME**
Over-priced, not the nicest lodging, and they were selling food out of the hiker box. I get it that the town is dying, but not cool. Prepare to be nickel and dimed until you set foot back on the Trail.

**Standing Bear Hostel, NC**
""Workers"" that push drugs and are generally Deliverance type hillbillies. And not the cool kind.

**White House Landing, Hundred Mile Wilderness, ME**
I didn't stay here personally, because I heard about how horrible it was. Throwing a stink when a hiker asked to charge his cell phone and camera batteries, not having any bedding, and charging people egregious amounts to stay. One thru-hiker had a $110 tab for a bunk, breakfast, a burger, and Aquamira.

* Framepack--A.L.I.C.E type pack or similar, with large pocket removed.
* Poncho--serves as raincoat, parka, groundcloth, shelter cloth, etc.
* Rainhat--indispensable because of variable weather.
* Sheath knife--small size. Pocket knife as auxiliary.
* Small axe--necessary for maintaining campfire in rainy weather.
* Compass, waterproof matchsafe, snakebite kit-just in case.
* Cook kit-- Military Mountain kit or similar (two nested kettles and frypan)

* Extra set of clothing--for added warmth, rather than heavy underwear, and as a dry change after a rainy day.
* Socks--(heavy) reinforced wool or spun nylon.

* First aid kit--include foot powder, insect repellent etc.
* Headnet, flashlight, plastic food bags.


FOOD: Staples: cornmeal, oatmeal, flour, brown sugar, salt, raisins, potatoes, powdered milk, rice, dried meats, dried fruits, dehydrated vegetables (if available). I plan on supplementing this with store food.  

FOOTWEAR: Moccasin-type leather boots with nine-inch tops (protect ankles from sprain, bruise, snakebite).  I prefer boots to low cut shoes.  

I like things simple so no tent, bulky sleeping bag, cans or jars, air mattress, large sheath knife, large axe, bulky jacket or overcoat, conventional raincoat, firearms.

What do you think?

Thanks,

I know I could probably answer most of these questions myself with a bit of reading, but I'll be working 12 hours a day between now and then, so I won't have a lot of time to research.  

Our backgrounds:
I've never done a multi-day hiking trip, but I've been to the Smokies a dozen times, and Shenandoah a couple of times. I've day-hiked parts of the trail, and what I've been on seemed pretty easy. My friend is from Colorado, and she's done week-long hikes in the Rockies, but she's never seen the AT. We're setting a pace of 10 miles a day, because her experience in the Rockies leads her to believe that's all she can do.  

My plan:
I'd like to take a shuttle from Clingman's Dome in the Smokies to some point about 40-50 miles away, and hike back to my Jeep. It doesn't have to be Clingman's Dome, but that seems like a good spot. Would any other sections of the trail be better this time of year?  

Gear - I've got:  
-North Face Terra 65 pack  
-Steripen water purification system  
-A 1-liter canteen  
-50 feet of para cord  
-a lightweight windbreaker and a good poncho  
-first aid kit  
-toiletries, sunscreen, insect repellant  
-a decent amount of food  
-clothes, obviously  
-my friend has a camping stove and pot, and all the gear she needs  

I still need:  
-Bear bag for food  
-Sleeping bag  
-Tent (or do I?) (I'm leaning toward the REI Passage 1)  
-I'd like to pick up a ka-bar knife   

Am I missing anything? I know there are shelters every 5-10 miles on this part of the trail, will I even need a tent? Are there places to pitch a tent? Will the shelters be overflowing this time of year?  

I checked the weather forecast for Gatlinburg, the lows are supposed to be around 60 degrees on the nights I'll hiking. How much colder does it get on the trail than it is down in the valleys?  

With regards to water -- how much should I carry with me? How frequent are sources of water on the trail?  

Any recommendations for a particular shuttle service? There are a lot to choose from in the Smokies.  

Thanks in advance!

(Fingers crossed I can make it happen for 2015!) Good news is it also looks like I may be able to take a week to hike a small section of the trail with a friend next month! However, I don't really know where to start on doing such a short section hike.

Ideally, we'd like to make a road trip of it and go to Maine or NH (from upstate NY where we live). Never been up there, but from what I've read, it looks to be the most awesome part of the AT. It's not set in stone by any means, though, so I'd definitely be interested if people think that there is some hike somewhere else that we absolutely must see.

My main concern is the question of getting back to where we started hiking. If we go substantially far away from home, there's not much of a chance we can get a friend to taxi us to and from there. If there's a cool loop that we could complete, that'd be nice- I just definitely don't want to just hike 20 miles and then backtrack 20 miles. I don't know if there's anywhere where we could catch a bus or something back to where we started. And obviously, I'd like to do a more interesting section of the trail if anyone is familiar with a good part of it.

I only have a bit of backpacking experience (but enough that I'm comfortable doing this), and my friend has almost none but is in good shape. So I'm guessing we could pull off a 10 mile/day pace or so.

So I'm 24 years old I recently graduated from college and started a new corporate job. I've been working retail for the past 6 years and have never taken more than 4 days off. In the past few years I've put on weight, started smoking and stopped exercising. 

When I was fresh out of high school I was an avid outdoorsman i hunted fished took day hikes and camped. I always wanted to do a section hike but never did. 

Past few weeks of my life have been annoying. First world personal problems etc... So I decided I'm finally going on this hike. I know there's a way for a guy that's out of shape but determined to do it with the right equipment and planning. 

I'm not too humble to hike on the kiddie trails because I'm out of shape I just want to spend 5-6 days alone in the wilderness traveling. 

Things i would love to do along the way:

Hunt (I have valid nj firearms license and hunting permits) Im not against buying a gun specifically for the trip if need be

Fish

Kayak

Meet other hikers/campers

Cliff diving 

What section do you recommend and what should I take into account while planning this trip?

I really appreciate any advice about how I can do this.

I really don't want to end this on a sour note but I'm getting a lot of people telling me to get in shape, quit smoking first etc,. I don't want to put it off any more. I'm doing this. I have personal reasons that make this something I must do.

I’ll complete my bachelor’s in December 2013, so this might be one of the last chances I’ll get to do the trail.

Now, this is something I’ve wanted to do for as long as I can remember, but I definitely have some reservations. I would appreciate any feedback from the well of experience in this sub. I’ve done a good deal of research on the A.T.; including some reading on Reddit(shoutout to casual_redditor and rusty075 for some informative AMAs), so hopefully I won’t be asking a bunch of usual questions. 

* First of all – my most pressing concern – six months is a long time. Not that I wouldn’t mind winding down after college, but I absolutely hate being away from my girlfriend for that long. We’re not strangers to long-distance, as the first two years of our three-year relationship we spent the majority of time on opposite sides of the country, as I started my undergrad in Arizona and she her master’s in Connecticut. But during that we could Skype pretty much every night and of course text and call all day. Which is where my question comes in: how do hikers communicate with loved ones on the trail? If I brought a phone, would reception be a hassle? Is it frowned upon to bring a phone? If she wanted to come visit me at some point (all the way from Arizona), what’s the best way to coordinate that? 

* Secondly, a camera is a must, obviously. Any suggestions on what camera to bring? I currently shoot with an incredibly outdated but trusty Canon 20D, but I’ll probably be upgrading to a newer Rebel within a year or so. Do I want to avoid a DSLR to cut down on weight? Did anyone bring a tripod? 

* I think it’s safe to say I’m a pretty novice hiker. I spent four years in the Marine Corps, so I’ve done my fair share of trudging around with a lot of heavy shit, but I know that's not really the point of the A.T. Aside from that I’ve only ever done day hikes with pretty minimal weight. Since I won’t be hitting the trail for two years, I’d like to make the most of that time getting prepared. I figured I’m just going to try and hike a lot, or should I figure out a regimen of sorts? Also, does anyone know of some reliable resources to find a good overnight trail in Arizona? 

* Also, I don’t have a lot of gear questions – I have two years to figure that out – but I’m a pretty tall guy and was curious if anyone had suggestions for particular packs to look at? I’m 6’5”. Also, hiking poles. Are they necessary? I’ve never hiked with them, so I’m completely oblivious here. 

Thanks in advance.

Well, my mom got kinda mad at me when I told him I wouldn't be available (joking, because really, it's my brother getting married...) and now I'm wondering what I should do in terms of hiking for the 2012 season.    

I wouldn't consider it a true thru-hike if I'm off the trail for like a week, week and a half in April, and I wouldn't really be able to afford the extra flights anyway.    

I live in CT, and have done about 50% of the trail between here and Katahdin as day hikes, so what I'm thinking is to just set out and do a stretch of it when I get back from the wedding (late April, early May) and go as far north as I feel like doing in one continuous trek, which I'm thinking will be somewhere around Mt. Washington. I don't think I'd want to go all the way to Katahdin, I'll save that for when I do a real thru-hike, sense of accomplishment and all that. And I feel Mt. Washington will be a good end to the smaller journey.    

The other option I have is to wait until it's about the right time where other northbound hikers are passing through the area (I'm not really sure when this will be, though... June-ish?) and try to meet up with a group doing a thru-hike and just tag along for a couple of weeks or something.

My question is this,
is there any point to carry in July in NY/CT/MA:
A Thermal jacket/vest?
Midweight Hiking socks?
Thermal bottoms, like Capilene 1 or Thermasilk?
Rain mitts?
very thin glove liners (why do I need these in July?)

I have:

* favorite shoes moab ventilators and Sole footbeds
* favorite socks ultralight coolmax hikers (2 pair)
* DirtyGirlGaiters
* 5oz Royal Robbins Fuse shorts (might swap to the running shorts with mesh mantra)
* ExOfficio Boxers
* ExOfficio Nio Amphi convertible pants (these are heavy compared to others, and it's July, why need pants?)
* DriDucks UL rain pants (might make into the every so fashionable rain skirt)
* Montbell dynamo wind pants

* Short sleeve quick dry shirt

* Montbell Tachyon anorak rain coat
* DriDucks rain coat

* Hat,
* cotton bandana
* turtle fur balaclava
* head bug net

SO what am I missing as far as clothing?

My boyfriend (age 27) and I (age 23) recently heard about the Appalachian Trail and something about it just jumped out at us as something we should do. We aim to do a NOBO thru-hike.

My boyfriend recently graduated college and I'm unemployed, so it feels like the perfect time. But... due to financial issues, and the prime starting time passing us by.. it seems like the best we could do is next year (2014) start date.

At least this will give us more time to prepare mentally and physically. I just hope we're at a point in our lives to do this thing next year!

So anyway, I had some questions I wanted to ask to help us be more prepared for next year.

* How in-shape do you need to be to start? If I must be honest, I was hoping to get in shape on the trail. we're both at least 100lbs overweight. I was wondering if anyone had experience with doing the trail as a weight-loss and fitness journey?

* Is there anyway to cut the costs of the trip? We're completely willing to not eat-out or sleep in motels while in town to save money. (We don't smoke, and we don't drink.) I read that the trail costs about $3,000 per person not including gear, is that the minimum for food and necessities?

* Gear: I read the FAQ on the right side, but I was wondering if there is a list of ""Bare necessities needed for a complete thru-hike""? or is that THE bare necessities? We need to cut costs as much as possible, to make the trip a reality...

* Meals: We're vegetarian. How much harder will it be for us to get nutrition on the trail? It seems like most trail food agrees with us, except for things like jerky and sausage. Nuts and beans sound like they'd be fine for protein. (EDIT: Found a thread about vegetarianism hiking [Here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/trailmeals/comments/1byf2l/help_a_vegetarian/) still open to suggestions for such a long hike though!)

As the title states, I'm taking a week off work in late July or early August and I'd like to do a 5-6 day hike within a (relatively) short drive from my home in Richmond, VA.

I'm not exactly new to hiking or camping, but this will be my longest time out and I'll be using mostly new equipment. I don't have much experience with a heavy pack, but I am an active distance runner so I'm hoping to make good distance per day without missing anything by trying to hurry through. My friend coming with me isn't a runner, but he's in relatively good shape as well.

So what's a good little mini-section hike in NC/VA/MD that would be good in the hot summer months of July/August? Is the heat going to be absolutely unbearable, or will we be high enough up that it'll cool off a bit? What's a realistic number of miles to do?

I'd like to see a popular section of the trail, but we're definitely looking to be on our own for most of the trip (camping out rather than staying in shelters, for example).

Thanks in advance! I'll answer any followup questions if you have any.

Best,

After eyeing the Appalachian Trail for a few months I've finally decided to hike a part of this trail in a time stretch of 4 to 5 weeks, starting around April 1st (A popular starting date it seems, so I might change this by a few days). I'm from The Netherlands, recently graduated from college and my father has quite some Airmiles left for me to spend on a plane ticket for this 'once in a lifetime' hike. I need your help on the following:

Where should I start? I would like to know which parts of the AT I should have seen, according to you. I have to combine the trail with a plane ticket, so Atlanta and Washington as starting point seem the most suitable in my position. I will return half way, so my start and finish will be the same place. Here's what I've thought of so far:

**Route A: Atlanta, NOBO** 

Springer Mountain (official starting point) &gt; Clingman's Dome, branching off to Gatlinburg to resupply. Returning to Springer Mountain after resupply.

Distance: 2 times -+198 miles, in 40 days: 10 miles a day minimum.

**Route B: Washington, NOBO**

Harper's Ferry &gt; Port Clinton, branching off to Reading to resupply. Returning to Harper's Ferry after resupply.

Distance: 2 times -+212 miles, in 40 days: 10,6 miles a day minimum.

**Route C: Washington, SOBO**

Harper's Ferry &gt; The Priest, branching off to Lexington or Glasgow to resupply. Returning to Harper's Ferry after resupply.

Distance: 2 times -+191 miles, in 40 days: 9,5 miles a day minimum.

**Route D: New York, NOBO**

New York has an airport, but getting to the trail from there seems to be pretty difficult. Therefore; no specific route.

**Other info:**

- I am a relatively frequent runner, 22 years old, won't hesitate to go over the '10 mile per day minimum' if I feel I can do it. I can't really compare running to hiking, but I thought I should mention.
- Actual hiking experience is limited, having done a 2-day hike in the Italian mountains (2011) and a 10 day roadtrip to Scotland during which I've climbed the [Ben Nevis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Nevis) (2012) and other smaller mountains.
- I would like to hike the most interesting/diverse trail, deciding between these four unless you know a better option.
- I've used [this map](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/eb/AppTrailMap.svg) and [this chart](http://www.summitpost.org/appalachian-trail-mileage-chart/593282) to calculate distances.
- Will spend March for preparations and buying the right gear, aiming for April 1st to May 7th as the total amount of time. This is not exactly 40 days, so I might start earlier.

With only 90 days or less left before many of you head out for the adventure of a lifetime, if doable, you should get your body prepped for hills. They are coming. They are going to hit you quick. They are going to be hard. You are going to sweat more than you could ever imagine. Getting your body ready now will only relieve you of stress that takes it's toll while adapting to the new strength requirements you're asking your body to perform. 

If you can, get on a stair machine at a gym. This is as simple as it gets. Pick the number of stairs (or floors) you wish to reach and do them. Once you complete that goal, evaluate the intensity which you think it took to finish. Could you have done more? Maybe another 20, 40 steps? A few more floors?  Make that the next go around's goal. Repeat. After a few weeks, really start to push goals. Mountains are kinda big. Ups, sometimes, go on for miles.

No gym? That's cool, head on over to either your local high school's football field for the stadium steps, retaining wall steps of a dam, or any place where there may be a significant amount of steps to cut down on rests in between sets. In a pinch, a steep hill or path will work. Just like your mechanized brothern (or sistern) pick a number and do it. Push yourself. Complete, evaluate (be honest with yourself) and adjust for the next time.

This workout is going to help get your body prepared for the hills. Almost every hiker dreads ups. By having a little bit of conditioning done ahead of time, I believe, your transition to trail life will be quite a bit smoother than those who do not.


Bonus workout: If you are the employed sort, waiting these last few weeks away in a structure that has more than one floor, forgo the elevator. Every little bit counts.  If you're ""under-employed,"" that's cool. Find a large building and access the stairs next to the elevator. You don't have to work there (public building are best for this) to access them, silly fire codes. :)   Even better, those spaces are usually quasi-heated for your winter time workouts. 

Oh yeah, NO WEIGHTS! No pack, no ankle weights, no poles, none of it. You don't need that right now. This is for priming those climbing muscles.

GOOD LUCK!!

so first post here so take it easy on me.  I'm looking to make a Thru hike of the AT this year but i have some hurdles that i'm trying to overcome and i was hoping this community might be able to help.  First, i'm fairly young, 20 yrs old, and i'm still living with my parents and so convincing them to let me go would be the first step.  Next is that i don't have many friends who want to do nearly as much as i do if at all and even the ones who i might be able to sell on it have little to no experience backpacking.  Which leads me into my last problem, i am no stranger to the outdoors, hiking, camping, starting fires, leave no trace rules and the like. However, i have only been backpacking a few times and this would be a much larger trip then anything i have done before.  

So to sum things up:

* I am fairly young and need to sell my parents on the idea of me walking through the woods for 5 months.
* I can't find anyone to go with, especially no one with any experience backpacking
* I am fairly inexperienced myself, and although i don't think i'm biting off more then i can chew, i may be.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read my post, any comments and idea are all greatly appreciated.",,False,,t5_2stbz,False,,,True,t3_14k0l9,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/14k0l9/help_me_get_on_the_trail/,

Second, how busy will the trail be? I plan to do the hike from June 15th to June 22nd. Will there be room available in shelters or should I expect to sleep on the ground at this time?

I'm so thrilled that this subreddit exists :D

As the title says I'm writing a book where the Appalachian trail happens to be featured pretty extensively, especially around the Monson area in Maine. My book is modern-fantasy noir, and for various reasons several of the characters converge at this particular trail village.

Here's a [link to my blog](http://proverbamodei.blogspot.com/) with chapters from the story. Chapter 13 and onwards is where Monson / Sebec Lake are the featured setting, though the trail near Lexington Virginia is mentioned in chapter 7.

My question for you folks is this - what is the trail like in this area? How is the weather? What is the general mood of the folks who live in the trail villages in Maine and New Hampshire? Do they treat hikers kindly (I've heard that they do). What is the flora and fauna like? How easy is it to get 'away from it all' and be surrounded by miles of woodland? Also - what's the nearest hospital to Monson that receives severe accidents? Is there one closer than Bangor?

Good luck to everyone hiking! The AT looks amazing, and I look forward to when I can afford to do some of it too :)

I have basic backpacking gear and have been on a handful of weekend trips (solo or otherwise), but I’m still nailing down my initial thru gear list. I obviously don’t need all of this stuff for a long time, but I wanted to get an idea of what to look for in certain items so that I can get a good deal when one comes along.

**Cold weather clothing:**

* What are my alternatives to a down jacket? I’m allergic and I’d rather not submit myself to a potential problem unless it’s the only choice. Will a heavy-duty fleece be warm enough?

* I have a generic rain jacket now, but it’s significantly heavier/bulkier than the fancy ones. Does anyone have any good rain jacket suggestions that are fairly inexpensive but would improve my rain jacket situation?

* What is everyone’s take on long underwear? It sounds like pants are near universal, but tops are occasionally replaced by a warm long sleeve shirt.

**Pack:**

* Will a 60L provide plenty of space? I have a 44L now and was busting at the seams on my latest outing. I know I’m supposed to wait until I figure everything else out, but I don’t like guessing at what I should be looking for in the next 9ish months.

* Do most people go with a rain cover or a liner? I bought trash compactor bags to test out and they were too big of a hassle, but it could be because my current pack is so small.

**Multi-tool:**

* Suggestions for a handy, lightweight solution that won’t break the bank?

Thanks for all your help!

So...  
1. Would it be possible to hike from GA-&gt;Harper's Ferry in minimalist running shoes (Nike Flyknit Racers)? I have never sectioned below GSMNP, but have always hiked in low-quarters (this would be the first time hiking in running shoes).  
2. Should I switch to leather hiking boots (LL Bean) or trail running shoes (Vasque)?  
3. Is 3-5 days the standard for going into town in order to resupply, and if so is it possible to still hike 20+ miles with a resupply?  
4. On that note, when you go into town do you usually take a shower and then laundry, and while the laundry is being done do some shopping and some R&amp;R? What is the typical procedure in town? Or do shops not care if you stink?  
5. Any towns out there in the south that are a hidden gem? So we all know about Neels Gap, Fontana, Franklin, Damascus, Hot Springs ...  
6. Have you seen thru-hikers hike in racing shorts (1-2"" inseam). Otherwise I'll just use my running shorts that have a slightly longer inseam, but still have a liner.

As background, I have several years of intermediate backpacking experience as a Scout. I first fell in love with the idea of thru hiking when I visited Shenandoah as a grader schooler. Since then I have mostly just been running (collegiate athlete done with school).

I have fantasized about doing something like hiking the AT for a long time, and want to put the plan into action and do a thru-hike next year. Is this a ludicrous idea? Is it the kind of thing I can prepare for in the span of a year?

I've read the FAQ, and am nervous but not overwhelmed yet (should I be?). The thing I worry the most about it my fitness - I'm not overweight (6'0"", 185lbs), but I'm hardly muscular (&lt; 25th percentile in upper body strength for my age group, average most other places). What kind of shape do you recommend as a target? How should I get there?

Another thing is that I am a sports-induced asthmatic. When I did my weeklong trip in high school, I started off rough but was able to do the two 10+ mile days we ended up walking. Many inhalers exist now for athletic asthmatics, but I don't have one. Can anyone speak to this problem?

Also...about the internet and smartphones. I've heard some people are off-put by technology on the trail, which makes sense to me I guess. The basement dwelling nerd in me though wants to know things, though, and it seems to me like having a smartphone would be an awesome way to experience the trail. Is it possible to actually have a connection at all? How frowned upon is it, really?

Also, I am an ent of sorts, and would love to carry some trees with me. How much of a risk is that sort of thing?

In the next couple days I am going to be getting a pack and tent.  I have most of the other things needed from previous treks.  

I want to splurge on the pack I have tried the ""Osprey Atmos 65"" in an outfitter and it was the most comfortable pack I tried but it is a bit expensive. 

For the tent I think Ill be getting the ALPS Mountaineering Mystique 1 or 1.5 I heard they are the same quality of tents costing hundreds more.  I'm just a little worried that  3lb 11oz (1652g) may be a bit heavy.  Eureka has lighter one man tents around the same size and price but I heard they are not nearly as durable.  

I will also be needing a new sleeping bag and I was wondering if anyone has tried a fleece sleeping bag.  I saw one in dicks that was very cheap, light weight, and packs smaller then any bag I have ever seen.

He was going to help me with what gear to get and how I should setup my pack. Unfortunately we did not have the time to sit down and figure all of this out due to me being very busy and him in such a hurry to get back onto the trail. Money is not a issue anymore and I'm stuck here scratching my head on what I should get.

I hesitated to post this because the exact same problem is in many a thread on whiteblaze, but oh well.

I am at a complete standstill in choosing between the [Tarptent Notch](http://www.tarptent.com/notch.html) and [Big Agnes Copper Spur](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Tent/copperspurul12012). I like these because they're relatively roomy (for 1 person) and double-walled. 


BA Pros/Cons:

* Larger width (1.07m)

* Will probably get more use out of it after the AT because I generally do not use trekking poles

* Has great reviews, lots of youtube videos (although BA is a bigger company, so that's to be expected)

* More expensive (~$350)

* Heavier (44oz)

TT Pros/Cons:

* Lighter (26 oz) because of the trekking pole setup (from everyone's advice I know poles are a necessity)

* Cheaper (though not by much once I consider seam sealing and shipping)

* Also has good reviews, but I think overall it's been less tested in the field? Again, TT is a small cottage company, so I guess this comes with the territory.

* I like the two doors/two accessible vestibule setup better than the 1 door BA, but the width is smaller (0.81m).

Is it too soon?",fieldsofgreen,5,1,8,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/11dgy3/considering_a_2013_nobo_thru_with_my_gf_we_have/,"Hi there! So My GF and I have already been planning a move to North Carolina in the near future (possibly February). We plan on living with her Dad at his private airport, and working for him. There is tons of land, and time not spent working at the AP would be spent in the woods camping/hiking/testing out gear. We recently starting looking into the AT, and already we have fallen in love with it. The distance, the scenery, the discipline it would take...and on top of all that the awesome people we would meet along the way. We have decided this is absolutely something we want to do - and together. 

My worry is that we don't have enough time to plan, and we still have quite a bit of gear to acquire. We are very thrifty, and have already hit up things like REI garage sales and acquired some essentials for cheap. We also both need to save money, which is another problem...but I've already created a budget for myself that allows for saving, and plan to so the same to help my GF. We plan to be as frugal as possible on the trail, not going to bars or motels, and avoiding town/eating big/etc at all costs. We know it will be temping, but we are there to experience the trail, and lots of town stops are my necessary. 

Another thing - from journals I've read and others I've talked to, people who start slow and take it easy seem to be the ones that actually end up finishing. I have no problem starting a bit earlier so that we can take an extra week or two and go slower. We also don't plan on staying in towns for extended periods....2 days max in any town, and that would be rare. Any tips on going slower so you have a better chance of finishing?

I'm worried if we don't go this coming year, we never will because of obligations. How should we start planning? All we have decided is that we're going NOBO, starting sometime late March, and we really want to finish :). Please help us make this a reality!

The first time was a few years ago in Craig County.  The bear saw us first and our attention was drawn to it as we saw his big bum bouncing down the hillside away from us.  The second time was on the way to Dragon's Tooth (near Salem, VA) and a baby cub crossed the trail right in front of us.  We turned and walked back to the car not knowing where momma-bear was.

I guess what I'm wondering is how isolated will I be if I leave in August SOBO?  If I have to, I can try a Flip-Flop, but I won't really be connecting with people that much anyway since I'll be going slowly and they'll be seasoned at their point in the journey.

I have checked out trailjournals.com, I know it's popular.  I may be wrong here, but it seems like you can only read one entry at a time on trailjournals?  I was really hoping for more of a blog-style site, where every entry can be seen in reverse chronological order by just scrolling.  Pictures as well, it seems that trailjournals has a separate link just for a hikers pictures.   

Also, I think it would be cool to have an interactive map feature where I could ping my locations as I go along, then maybe even tie my media to those pings.  I don't think I have seen anything like this though.  

Postholer seems pretty cool from what I've heard, any experience with it?  Does it allow video uploading?

He had strong lower beard around the chin, you could not call it a neck beard because by comparison Johnny Walker took that title.  
Sleepwalker wore hiking boots and a long sleeve Under Armor shirt, his beard was dark brown, his hair short, curly, stood up with assistance form sweat and lack of showering. When he spoke his lower jaw projected and his bottom teeth were exposed rather than his upper teeth. He smiled, often. 
Johnny walker wore a silver plated chain necklace, the kind that stereotypical New Jersey guys wear. It looked cheap. He began in Pennsylvania and his beard began on the neck but stopped just below his cheeks, it was much thinner than the others. His mustache was thin and jaw line long yet strangely thin given his body type. Just by looking at his face you could tell that he had lost a significant amount of weight since being on the trail. He wore red trail running shoes and cargo pants. Of the four Johnny looked the least like a ‘hiker’, yet his enthusiasm for the trail surpassed all the others. 
Shake wore a hand crocheted hat, complete with earflaps and the AT logo. His beard met his lips and left no room for bare skin, so thick his face was hidden. Shorter and more talkative than the rest, he wore a long sleeve and pants. 
Keystone, has a tattoo on hi left hand between his thumb and pointer finger. A simple black mark in the shape of a keystone, Pennsylvania ‘The Keystone State.’  
Sleepwalker had a habit of walking late into the night, continuously reaching camp far past sunset.  Others would ask how he arrived so consistently past sunset. “ You just have to sleep walk sometimes,” He responded.
Johnny Walker started in Pennsylvania unlike the other three. On the waning night before starting the trail he drank heavily and received a name that friends gave to him. One must assume that there was a fair amount of whiskey involved in that night. 
Stash did not reveal the origin of his trail name. Other through hikers knew him for his hiking style, slow yet enjoyed every minute of it. He often said ‘if you finish last, you finish first.’ This was evident due to the number of towns and cities he had left the trail for in order to party, visit, or acquire stashes of pot, or so I hypothesized.
Most admitted that the trail was very hard and that even with only 600 miles left that they were never planning on hiking the trail again. Perhaps they will feel differently upon completion.
My night had begun as a random night with friends at the River Mill, which I abandoned due to a sour mood I had been in. Alex was bartending and the Floor Boards were crammed into the front corner of Gilles. I asked Sleepwalker and Keystone if they were through hikers, to my elation they were. I bought many beers because I was not able to offer my home as place to stay. Brain, from Newport had already offered a place to stay. He was happily drunk, a country fella who was confident in his driving abilities. PBR 24oz cans were accepted all around with smiles painted under their scraggly beards. An AT hiker will never turn down a beer. 
Stash remarked, “if you finish last you finish first.” Johnny Walker agreed. He had been hiking every day with Stash for last 400 miles. The two made a dynamic friendship that was apparent just moments after meeting the two. Keystone had only known the other three for a day, and Sleepwalker seemed to have hiked with the Johnny and Stash for a week and a half. He felt that their pace and use of car that Stash had acquired was slow, not the pace at which he wished to finish the trail.
Sleepwalker drank less than the others and was far more focused than the other three. They had all spent a week of zero days at Murtal beach with Stash’s friends. They drank, drove, and ended up in Blacksburg because of Brain. As the night carried on it became quite apparent that Sleepwalker was ready to detach from the group, he had enjoyed the change of pace and relaxation but was determined to finish the trail the same as he had started it, a sleepwalker.
The outside seating of Gilles provided a place for us to escape the loud crowded scene inside. All of the boys enjoyed the women of Blacksburg, Johnny walked for a while behind two girls up to the Lyric and came back after no success. 
As we walked to Brian’s truck, a group of sorority girls were selling brownies at the corner of Main Street. All of us 6 asked if they were ‘special’ to which there was no reply. We exchanged handshakes and well wishes. I never heard or saw the four hikers again but heir stories will live on.

I was in PA and NY during May of last year, but I was still hiking through some pretty severe heat.  I was just wondering if that was going to be unbearable down south.  I thought the mountains might cool it off some.  Keep in mind, I don't think i'll be able to finish, but if I do i'll be skipping from harper's ferry to vermont.

1357879486.0,3,self.AppalachianTrail,16d1h3,I would love your help filling in a few gaps in my pack list.,dahvzombie,3,0,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/16d1h3/i_would_love_your_help_filling_in_a_few_gaps_in/,"As you might have guessed if you've seen how often I comment in this sub, I'm really stoked for this spring's attempt. I'll be starting with a friend of many years and my long-term GF. Me and my friend aren't going to try to stick together no matter what, but we've sectioned at the same pace in the past. GF isn't quite as strong a hiker as me, but if I spot her a few pounds and take it a little easier she can keep pace. She'll probably drop if I do but I'm set on hiking with or without her- given the drop out rate, it'd be pointless to do otherwise I think.

At any rate, I'm looking for specific recommendations on some gear I either haven't bought yet or have some doubts about, for both me and  her. I'm on a budget, not hugely tight, but I am taking a few extra pounds over spending a lot on gear. 

HEADLAMPS (Both): I like the look of the black [diamond gizmo](http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/mountain/lighting/gizmo-headlamp/), with lithium batteries to save a little weight. 

POLES (Me): I'm 5'10, and I think [Black Diamond Trail Back](http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/mountain/trekking-poles/trail-back-trekking-pole/) poles seem as good as any for a midrange price. 

SLEEPING PAD (Me): The thermarest z-lite is wonderfully light and simple, not to mention very popular from what I've seen, but frankly I can't sleep well on it. My main question here is, can I get away with an uninsulated air mattress like [this](http://www.exped.com/exped/web/exped_homepage_na.nsf), or will I freeze in the smokies if I don't get an insulated one?

SLEEPING BAG (Her): She still needs a bag. She's 5'5"" and a fairly cold sleeper. Can she get away with a [Kelty Cosmic Down 20](http://www.amazon.com/Kelty-Cosmic-20-Degree-Sleeping-Regular/dp/B005F5EPAG/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1357877832&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=cosmic+down)? Or does she need something warmer? We'll be sharing a 2-person tent and I'll probably throw my down jacket  over her bag to help a little. At the moment I'm thinking to get it, and bring a liner as cheap, light insurance against a cold snap. 

FOOD BAG (Both): I think the large [Outdoor products bag from this set](http://www.amazon.com/Outdoor-Products-3-Pack-Ultimate-Sack/dp/B001AZNATC) will serve as a food bag. It's maybe 9 liters. Any recommendations for or against? There are reviews but none I could find specifically by long distance hikers. 

GROUNDCLOTH (Both): We've got a [Big Agnes Fly Creek UL2](https://www.bigagnes.com/Products/Detail/Tent/FlyCreekUL2). We've used it with an existing ground mat I've had, I think it's PVC. Are there any real gains to be made by switching to a tyvek sheet or something? Can I go without? I've had the fortune to never be tenting in a serious rain so I don't really know.

RAIN GEAR (Both): We have some crappy ponchos but I have serious doubts about their efficacy when it's 33 degrees and raining. I think they're fine for more moderate weather, and for summer we've simply done without. I like the looks of the frogg toggs DriDucks series, either the [DuraLite 3](http://www.froggtoggs.com/store/outerwear-rainwear/suits/driducks/dri-ducks-dura-lite-15.html) or the [Ultralight 2](http://www.amazon.com/frogg-toggs-Ultra-light-Suit/dp/B007X5XB2Y). I know they won't be that durable, but they only need to last maybe two months down south then another month towards the end- we'll use the lighter ponchos or even nothing in the middle.

PACK COVER (Me): I've got a rather unusual pack with a 40 year old, external frame pack. It is about 8 ounces heaver (after some modifications) than a comparable, modern internal frame, but I'm keeping it because of budgeting, the fact that I've hiked a few hundred miles in in with no issues, and the ventilation. Any reason not to just use a heavy duty trash bag? 

Thanks for any help!

They took me up into the attic, and pulled out this old chest FULL of backpacking stuff, photo albums, and all kinds of stuff that they used when they hiked the trail in the 60's. He gave it all to me. They said they would do everything in their power to support help me with this journey.. I'm literally in tears of joy right now.

I realize that they probably would get cramped but I was wondering if there any other issues to consider. Any thoughts on this subject would be appreciated. Thanks!",,False,,t5_2stbz,False,,,True,t3_wuqzw,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/wuqzw/gear_question_bivouac_sacks/,

I hadnt hiked seriously since boy scouts but now really want to get back into it. Before college starts back in mid August, I am really considering hiking the 80 miles of GA AT. The problem is I have no real idea of how long it will take me, which shelters to stop at, or what to bring/expect. I have some rather out dated gear (a heavy sleeping, 2 person tent, and a large pad) and was wondering if there were alternatives. I also have a hennesey hammock and thought that that I could use that and only bring a blanket or 2.

I'm not worried about any problems, we all have good gear and experience, I'm moreso interested in suggestions for sections to do at this time of the year.

What can I do for him?,Punchcatpunchesshit,3,0,1,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/ss8lq/so_is_hiking_the_appalachian_trail_what_can_i_do/,"I already posted in /r/AskReddit but, because of some potential experience here, I feel like you guys would be able to help more.

My boyfriend began hiking NoBo from Georgia yesterday.  We set up dates and places for me to send care packages, and we already planned on creating a montage when he was done.  

*First the care-packages
    We set it up so I will be including socks, earplugs, certain maps, etc.  Is there anything besides notes and such that I can include to help him stay motivated, sane and happy?  Something to show him I'm thinking of him and that I miss him?  

*The Montage
    We took a trip to visit his family is WA state for the week before he started.  Our flights split in Chicago.  What we decided to do is take pictures of our feet everyday until he's back to show where they have taken us.  Our first picture is of both of ours together in the airport in Chicago.  This is good for him because it will show the ware and tear on his shoes, his feet growing from walking everyday,  the multiple pairs of shoes he'll be going through etc.  

I want to do something incredible for him, something to keep him smiling through out the trail.  He'll be coming through our home state July/August so maybe I can do something for him then besides meeting up with him and hiking part of the trail?  Oh and his birthday is in May and our anniversary is in June.

Any ideas, opinions, etc. are welcomed.",,False,,t5_2stbz,False,,,True,t3_ss8lq,http://www.reddit.com/r/AppalachianTrail/comments/ss8lq/so_is_hiking_the_appalachian_trail_what_can_i_do/,

I was sure I would find on the web somewhere a chart of how many thru-hikers are typically where and when, but I don't see such a thing.
