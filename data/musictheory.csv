This is -my- method for implementing modes effectively in modern compositions. It also helps for understanding progressions in popular music that people often ask about here at r/musictheory. This isn't the only way to think about it, it's simply how I think about it when I look at these progressions in the attempt to understand them.

**Comprehensive Modal Palette**

* C - I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, vii^o - Ionian, Major Mode
* D - i, ii, III, IV, v, vi^o, (b)VII - Dorian, Minor Mode
* E - i, (b)II, iii, iv, v^o, VI, vii - Phrygian, Minor Mode
* F - I, II, iii, iv^o, V, vi, vii - Lydian, Major Mode
* G - I, ii, iii^o, IV, v, vi, (b)VII - Mixolydian, Major Mode
* A - i, ii^o, III, iv, v, VI, (b)VII - Aeolian, Minor Mode
* B - i^o, II, iii, iv, V, VI, vii - Locrian, Minor Mode, hardly used. 
* Dim - i, bii^o, iii, biv, bV, v^o, vi, bvii^o - Chords of the Diminished Scale, alternative to Locrian mode

**Compelling Sonorities of Modes**

Quick reference chart for chords that more often ""strongly imply"" specific modes:
(Note, these are not *progressions* that imply a mode. This is a list that attempts to highlight where each tonic, subdominant, and dominant differ from one mode to the next. Sorry, u/spiderofdestiny, I should have been more clear about this. Thank you for your comment.)

* I, IV, V - strongly implies Major, Ionian (""vanilla"") mode
* i, IV, v (bVII) - implies Dorian
* i, bII, vii - implies Phrygian
* I, II, iv, V - implies Lydian, weaker implication here without #11 resolution in melody
* I, IV, bVII - strongly implies Mixolydian
* i, iv, v - strongly implies Aeolean (""vanilla"") mode

**The Theory Behind Using Modes**

To get the most use out of modes, we have to set aside our preconceptions of ""functional harmony"", that one chord must resolve to another in a specific sequence. While this is true of common practice conventions, this is not the case with modal writing. Instead, we're going to go back to Riemann and how functional harmony began as a concept.

In Riemann's view, functionality only concerned three chords of any key... the tonic, its subdominant, and its dominant. If you stacked all three of these chords on top of each other, you'd hear every note of the key. For example, in C Major, you have CEG, FAC, and GBD. Line those up and you have CDEFGABC... the whole scale. 

Sonorities other than the tonic, subdominant, or dominant actually began as ""extensions"" of either tonic, subdominant, or dominant. For example, a 'ii' chord in this key would be considered a subdominant chord over the root of the second scale degree, not a separate, independent sonority as it is labeled in common practice. The vii^o chord would be considered a ""weakened"" dominant, since we've removed the root of the chord. The 'vi' chord would be considered a ""submediant"" tonic since its root is below the root of tonic, and the iii chord would be considered a ""mediant"" tonic since its root is above the tonic. Trying to keep it simple here.

**Versatility**

What we need to realize here is that the underlying theory behind ""functionality"" is actually much more liberating when we take away the rest of the common practice formula. Even during the common practice, composers were ""borrowing"" from other modes. It wasn't necessarily against the rules to do this, it just doesn't easily fit into the model of procedural harmony and principles of voice leading at the very basic level of counterpoint. 

When you take, for example, a 'ii' chord and simply refer to it at the most basic level as a subdominant chord, you allow yourself several options. It could be a minor 'ii', you could alter the third and borrow it from the Lydian mode to make a 'II', or if you're using a minor mode like Aeolean, you could lower the root and turn it into a bII. 

There are still limitations. One limitation of the second scale degree, for example, is the bii (the minor Neapolitan in common practice), which even in the diminished scale doesn't present itself anywhere. This breaches the diatonic language of tertian harmony (building sonorities on thirds) and takes us into harmonies like Augmented Chords and so forth you learn about after your first semester/year of theory. The bii chord, in this case, would more likely be used to ""pivot"" to a different key than to evoke a mode. 

Regardless, there are hardly ANY pitfalls to using modality to create progressions, and it's extremely useful in analyzing tonal music from any number of periods as it becomes much more clear exactly where ""borrowed"" chords come from and how those chords influence the modal quality of the key. It's handy stuff to know when you write a progression, experiment with a chord from a different key, and want to understand how you did it so you can compose with more theoretical ""intent"" or understanding - so that this aesthetic can be replicated in other music you write. 

**Putting it to Use**

I'm just scratching the surface here. There's a great deal more that plays into this on a linear (melodic) level, and that's where chord extensions (7ths, 9ths, 11ths, and 13ths) really begin to come into focus. I just want to end this with a very basic example of how to ""evoke"" a mode in a key with informed purpose and intent, to mean that we haven't only borrowed a chord from another mode because we like it - we know where the chord comes from AND we know how it influences the mode of the key center we are currently using. 

The very basic structure we need to understand are the tonic, subdominant, and dominant sonorities for major and minor modes (Ionian and Aeolean specifically). These are:

* I, IV, V for Major
* i, iv, v for Minor

We are in some Minor key. One would expect a 'iv' subdominant, but we like the sound of the IV in this progression for some reason. From which mode are we borrowing this IV chord? Perhaps a better question to ask here is, ""Which mode contains a 'i' and a 'IV'?"" We can see from our chart above that the Dorian mode is our only candidate with a 'i' AND a 'IV'. So, when we borrow the 'IV' in a minor key, we are specifically borrowing the syntax to create a Dorian sound for our key. 

And really, we can do this with any chord from any key, major or minor. Let's use a Major key as an example, and this time, let's borrow a bVII. What mode has both a 'I' and a 'bVII'? Mixolydian. This is the ONLY mode that contains both. When we borrow multiple times, we can do so from any mode. For example, we can borrow the bVI from minor when we are in a Major key. What Major mode has a bVI and a I? None of them do. This is when we can say what we borrowed has created a ""mixed"" mode. Modes that ""mix"" well are those that trade their compelling sonorities. 

You can see in the ""compelling sonorities"" chart I made above that I refer to Ionian and Aeolean as ""vanilla"". All this means is that our ears are most accustomed to these modes culturally. There's nothing necessarily ""inherent"" in these modes that makes them this way, but some argue that the harmonic series has a lot to do with it. All you need to concern yourself with is how chords ""deviate"" from the expected, ""vanilla"" progression. It's almost like putting different flavors on vanilla ice cream. You could use Chocolate syrup, you could use Strawberry, or maybe you like it in the Banana Split fashion - Banana, Chocolate Syrup, maybe some nuts. 

When we mix modes, this is how we can do it with knowledge and intent. We can take the sonorities we would expect in the vanilla modes and mix in a sonority of a different flavor. The compelling sonorities chart isn't ""complete,"" and it really isn't set in stone either. Context is going to be important, but you'll also need to play around with these sonorities to find what best nurtures your aesthetic and interest in music. 

I hope this gives you a better understanding of where these ""borrowed"" chords and contemporary tonal harmony in general both come from. I've spent a lot of time trying to come up with ways of understanding and explaining it. I doubt it's perfect, but I hope this guide puts you on the path to writing the music you want to write and study the music that inspires you to learn. 

**tl;dr** - Tried to share my approach to contemporary tonal harmony using modes, some of the theory behind it, and how to use it. Hope I did a decent job. Please comment/upvote if you want more. Thanks for reading!

**Edit**: Hey all! Thanks for all the up-votes!! Definitely plan to do another one of these in the next week or so. I hope it's okay with u/big_star, but he posted a comment I wanted to respond to with an edit so everyone sees the difference between the way most of us tend to view theory compared to what I'm encouraging folks to think about, so here goes:

&gt;I didn't see this mentioned, but it's also possible to ""tonicize"" modes by making the V chord major (or dominant). we do this to the Aeolian mode when we harmonize it (hence the Harmonic minor scale), but it's possible to do this with the other minor modes as well, if you want to create functional progressions. 

While this is technically true, I've been finding that the way to ""tonicize"" modes is not necessarily through V-I or V-i relationships. The trick is to actually use the ""tendency"" chords/sonorities that ""imply"" the mode. For example, when in Dorian, the IV chord is the ""tendency"" chord, primarily because the subdominant is minor in our ""vanilla"" Aeolean mode. A simple, Dorian progression could be i - IV, as opposed to the i - iv we would expect to hear from using the Aeolean mode exclusively.

I'm also finding that using these tendency sonorities makes V7-I/i relationships even more compelling, not for the relationship itself but rather the intensity of the cadence into an important mode or key. I might be in a minor key, borrow a IV, give it a Dorian flavor, then modulate to a new key/mode using V7 of the key I'm attempting to modulate to - heck, I could add a minor 7th to the IV chord to modulate to the bVII, making it the new key center. 

I just wanted to explain the difference I see in using the V7 sonority to tonicize a ""pitch-center"" compared to using a ""tendency sonority"" to evoke or imply a mode. There's a subtle but important difference, I think.

My background: several decades in music, meaningless Juilliard degrees, this is my career, my passion, my life's work, blah blah bling bling blah.)

Inspired by [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/12j97f/can_absolute_pitch_be_learned/) recent /r/musictheory post, and in particular, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/12j97f/can_absolute_pitch_be_learned/c6vjfwf) top-ranked comment, I feel strongly moved to provide some insight into what perfect pitch really is, what it does, how it works, and the truths about its pros and cons.  There seem to be some genuine misconceptions.

Now, it seems like perfect pitch is the unknown 3rd topic never to bring up at the dinner table (after politics and religion); it seems sometimes to inspire reactions which bear non-trivial similarity to class warfare.  **I have absolutely no interest in this petty war.  I just want to share experiences and observations** -- both positive and negative -- over a lifetime of perfect pitchiness.  

And yes, I admit there is something personal here as well.  It may sound strange or silly, but people with perfect pitch very often personify the ability to the point where it becomes like a ""close friend"".  We develop a profound intimacy with it, it's been with us our whole lives, it brings us joy (and sometimes misery, as I'll mention later), it seems to make us special.  I am not describing the joy of clutching a treasure or a trophy.  Rather, it's simply something that's been with us for decades, something we've been using nearly nonstop all these years.  Imagine if you got your first [IBM M keyboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard) when you were 6, and you've been using it for the past 30 years, and the entire time, people keep talking about how overrated it is :)  Course it ain't overrated, it's the best keyboard ever!

So when people diminish perfect pitch, calling it a ""party trick"", it feels like you're slighting a close friend.  And it ain't like I want everyone to love my friend, I just wish my friend were understood a little bit better. 

So, in the aim of understanding my friend a bit better, here's the straight-talk.

**No, PP is not ""a party trick"".  It's not even really a ""tool"".  It's a faculty.**  

Calling perfect pitch a ""party trick"" betrays a misunderstanding of how perfect pitch is applied.  It isn't like a gadget that is employed to identify pitches on an ear-training test.  Rather, PP turns you into a **fundamentally different musical creature** from the ground up.  It's like having an additional organ that **involuntarily** pre-digests music before it ever gets to your conscious brain.  

A close analogy would be your eyes.  When you look out your window, you see a tree, the sky, a few cars, and a hobo.  In that moment when you look out the window, you receive an instantaneous understanding of what is out there.  **At no point do you have to examine each individual element** -- ""those round black shapes on the bottom, the clear bits on the sides ... this must be a car!""  No, the entire picture has been presented to you with perfect clarity and detail, in a flash.

Or perhaps consider what it's like when someone is talking to you.  Your friend says to you, ""hey so I saw a hobo outside your window yesterday, and he was urinating on a cat who didn't seem to mind"".  You don't have to figure out the meaning of every word individually -- rather, you parse the entire sentence in one ear-gulp with full meaning, **reflexively and involuntarily**.  You can't NOT understand what your friend has told you, as much as you might want to.  You have the information whether you asked for it or not.  Now that it's there, you can set your conscious mind to the task of figuring out how you're going to clean your cat.

So imagine what happens when someone with PP listens to a song.  Without consciously using her brain, she immediately knows every single note of every single chord.  She did not use any ""tools"" to determine the relationships between notes, or to identify the various modulations or recognize non-scale tones.  She simply received the song in a pre-packaged, 100% complete state.  Song.7z.  What she decides to do with that package of data is up to her.  But the way she apprehended the music is fundamentally different than if she did not have PP.

When you have perfect pitch, **harmonic and melodic analysis are essentially effortless**.  The increase in efficiency cannot be overstated.  Since you have immediate access to the notes, **you can make thematic connections that you might not otherwise be able to find**.  

The main effect here is simply one of increased efficiency.  To a musician with perfect pitch, transcribing the chords and main melodies of a song is basically like flexing a muscle.  Those are the short term benefits, (along with acing those annoying ear-training tests, and while it's outside the scope of this blather, it's worth noting that kids with perfect pitch should almost certainly be taught ear training separately from other students.  Talk about starting a war!  Trust me, I know it sounds shitty and obnoxious.  But the fact is, to a kid with perfect pitch, conventional ear-training can be extremely confusing and misleading.  I'll let someone else bring it up another time.)

The long-term effects are the meaningful ones, though.  These are what make someone with PP such a fundamentally different creature.  It is what confers upon us the greatest gifts, and also ensures occasional misery.

**When you have perfect pitch, your brain is a music computer.  If it hears any tones, it will process them.  Chimes in an elevator?  It will process them.  Insurance ad jingle?  It goes through the CPU.  Perfect pitch floods you with data, immerses you with notes whether you like it or not.**

This ain't always so hot.  If you are stuck in a car with a friend who insists on listening to Fall Out Boy or The Decembrists (that's right, you heard me), it feels almost like an act of aggression.  You are basically forcing the person with PP to process data.  And like force-feeding a dude White Castle hamburgers, the experience can be pretty painful.  Sure, **transposing with perfect pitch is maddening and stressful**, but that pales in comparison with the other tortures you can inflict on someone with PP.

This is why you'll often hear that folks with PP prefer silence.  Not always.  But often.

But the upside to having an always-on music computer cannot be overestimated.  And it's not the ease of transcription, the aced ear training tests, or the efficient harmonic analyses that ought to be envied.  It's the fact that **perfect pitch enables a person to develop a deep, intimate connection with music that is not possible otherwise.**

The notes themselves are like friends, each with a distinct personality.  You've no doubt heard how people with PP talk about notes as though each one has a separate ""color"".  **People with perfect pitch who refer to notes as having ""colors"" are full of shit.**  What's REALLY happening there is an accumulation of memory and associations.  

**We remember every G# with emotional context.  Every B has a thousand subconscious stories.** 

Every single note is remembered, stored away, and recalled each time in aggregate.

So the point isn't that people with perfect pitch are full of shit.  The real point is that **the relationship they develop with the notes is real**.  That they are able to genuinely feel this closeness, this intimacy with music on the most granular scale, it is the love a mother has for every freckle on her baby's tummy.  No, obviously notes don't have colors, but they do all have memories, associations, and deep, deep feelings.

I wish I could explain these things better!  I apologize if I haven't offered any real insight.  I'm an oldfart!  In any case I'm at the text limit. So, some notes:

**PP doesn't magically turn you into a genius, or a top-echelon musician, or even a competent one.**  I know some people with PP who are shitty, shitty musicians.  And I know many musicians without PP who are astonishing.

**PP will, however, make you more likely to succeed in music.** You will find music easier, more personal, and more fun.   Perhaps more relevant, if your parents find out that you have perfect pitch, they are more likely to support your musical education.  All of this is a major predictor for a life or career in music.  

**Don't bother trying to ""learn"" perfect pitch if you don't already have it.**  Maybe it's possible, maybe it's not, who the hell knows.  The ""skill"" itself is pointless.  Instead, your time is better spent simply listening to as much music as you can, and forging your own relationship with music.  Try to make it as intimate and special as you can.  That is where the happiness is!  :)

Thanks for reading.

PS: For those interested to know, it's not all happiness.  I mentioned earlier that there can be some misery here as well.  A few years ago, my perfect pitch -- my closest companion for my entire life -- started going on the fritz.  More and more I began noticing that I was off.

At first I thought that I must have done too much drinking and drugging.  Then I began to suspect that maybe I had some degenerative brain disease.  Finally, I came to understand that sometimes, when you get older, perfect pitch -- like once-close friends, just drifts away.  And at the moment, I can't justifiably consider what I possess to be ""perfect pitch"" anymore.

Sometimes, It genuinely feels like a close friend has passed away -- I cannot emphasize enough how accurate that analogy seems.  The relationship that I used to have with the notes is just not as close as it used to be.

I recently did some research, and found that it is pretty common for perfect pitch to drift up one half-step with age, which is what has happened to me.  I'm okay with it now though.

Just found out about this subreddit, and didn't really see much actual music theory on here so thought I would start contributing. 

This method of harmonizing a melody is seen VERY frequently in the music of Debussy and many other composers during the Impressionist era to today. This gives a very ethereal, open sound and will transverse multiple tonalities when done correctly. I learned it from reading literature of the theorist Nicolas Slonimsky (forgot which book exactly, sorry), and it is one of my favorite colors to add when appropriate. 

To harmonize with all major chords, you should alternate between the Octave, Tertian, and Quintan positions:

Octave position: melody note (soprano) is the same as the root of the chord. So if ""C"" is my first melody note, I would start with C major chord. If the melody note is an F#, use an F# major chord, etc.

Tertian: melody note is the third of the chord. To find the root take given melody note ""E"", and go down a major third to ""C"", which will be the root of the chord (C major). So if the melody note is an F#, use D as the root of the chord (D major). 

Quintan: melody note is the fifth of the chord. To find the root, take given melody note G and go down a perfect fifth to C, which will be the root of the chord (C major). So if the melody note is an A, use D as the root of the chord (D major). 


Now that you know what the positions are, you simply alternate between the positions (usually in ascending and descending order, but depends on the aesthetic scenario). 

Example. Take a simple ascending melody: C, D,F,G,A (rhythm variable).
                  
 -simply alternate between oct, ter, and quin positions: 

Octave C (C major), Tertian D (Bb major) [D is the 3rd of Bb major], Quintan F (Bb major) [F is the 5th of Bb major] , Tertian G (Eb major), Octave A (A major)


It was characteristic of Impressionist composers to start and end a phrase with Octave (starting with Tertian is also fairly common, but usually always ends in octave position to temporarily provide a tonality) position when harmonizing with major chords, so any order of positions that satisfy this will work well. 

You can also add passing tones and other none chord tones pretty effectively to spread out the harmony. However, I wouldn't dabble in this until you are comfortable harmonizing each melody note individually (which is actually more common).

The most common root movement between chords in jazz is a 5th downwards (I IV vii iii vi ii V I) etc. Well, theres an extremely common way of dealing with voice leading for this progression in jazz, and is used in almost all big band charts for horn parts for chord progressions. 

The root is always covered by the bass, so we don't worry about that.

The 3rd of a chord will hold over into the next chord, becoming the 7th

the 5th of the chord will hold and become the 9th

the 7th of the chord will resolve down and become the 3rd

the 9th (if one), will resolve down to become the 5th


What you get is a never ending descending voice leading in the most common jazz progression there is. And the only problem there is with it is that it keeps going DOWN, but you usually pick a spot in the middle where every voice jumps up one chord tone to keep the range consistent. 

An example would be this progression: Dmaj7, Gmaj9, C#mb5, F#mb9, Bm7, Em9, A7, Dmaj9. This is the ""prototypical"" jazz progression, as one of my teachers would say. 

    D  G  C# F# B  E  A  D
    F# F# E  E  D  D  C# C#
    A  A  G  G  F# F# E  E
    C# B  B  A  A  G  G  F#

notice how each chord appears full?
notice how each note in the progression tends to alternate holding over and moving by a step?

Yup, another musical sentence to remember, as if you don't have a dozen already. To begin, each word represents a mode. Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrain.

So lets say you were playing a song that had the root on the F, though seemed to contain the key signature from C major. What you need to do is identify the quantity of the interval between the two notes, with the root note on the top. In this case, going from F to the C below it would result in an interval of a fourth. The fourth word in the sentence is Lydian, therefore mode being played (root of F with the C major key signature) would be the Lydian mode.

I have a problem: I love music theory and I love pop music.  My two loves, however, don't love each other.

Classical music theory tells me that pop music is cheap and simple.  Pop songs are so simple and recycle so much harmonic content!  There are only a couple of chords that repeat over and over again.  Compared to the chromatic masterpieces of Schumann ([Dichterliebe, Das ist ein Flöten und Geigen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-uaLLFMwW8)), Chopin ([Preludes Op. 28 No. 9 in E major](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ry_-2edtJo)), Strauss ([Salome, Finale](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agx27K5iZ0Q)), and many others during the 19th century, these songs are really simple!  Modern songs are plain even in a textural sense--most pop songs are solo + accompaniment and rarely do you hear anything that can compare with Bach ([Art of Fugue, Contrapunctus 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwkzf-KUNPM)) or Byrd's ([Mass for Four Voices, Kyrie](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9yT0kLA6DHA)) polyphonic magic.  By these standards, music today should be extremely boring!

Pop music tells me a different story, though.  Music today is the farthest thing from being boring!  We have an amazing variety of sounds that are coming together--from R&amp;B (like John Legend's [PDA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwbNesQeods)) to EDM (like Skrillex's [Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSeNSzJ2-Jw)) to hip hop (like J Cole's [Nobody's Perfect](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMGrcWkf20k)) to indie rock (like Florence + the Machines' [No Light, No Light](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATfUdaZQLMA)) to folk (like The Civil Wars' [Poison &amp; Wine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcHI2uNHrvQ)) to way too many other aural experiences that I can list here.

Clearly, the theory I know is failing me.  Theory can't explain why a song of four chord repeated endlessly isn't mind-numbingly boring.  Theory can't differentiate between the myriad of beats and rhythms in modern pop and slaps the label of ""4/4"" over it.  Theory can't deal with the implications of dramatic increase in timbre possibilities made possible by the electronic synthesis of sound.

Music theory should be a way for us to think analytically about the music we hear and should ultimately seek to find the best ways to describe music so that general principles can be discovered.  Classic music theory based on Roman Numerals simply was not built to understand modern music.  We need a new system with which to understand modern popular music.  I'm not saying that we should simply throw out everything we've learned about tonal music but I think that attempting to analyze popular music with classical theory is like trying to weigh yourself with a ruler--you're using the wrong tool.

I'd like to start a discussion on how we can build a new theoretical system that can be used to understand the intricacies of modern popular music.  Among many things, here are the issues that I think this new system needs to be able to do:

* Categorize and analyze chord progressions: While it is convenient to notate chord progressions with Roman Numerals, I think that the practice is fundamentally flawed.  The Roman Numeral system of identifying chords is great for classical music where, in most cases, the music manages our expectations by expanding the cadential motif of the tonic, subdominant, and dominant.  Popular music seems to manage our expectations in a different way.  Each unique chord progression is its own motif and a song works precisely because this progression of chords is repeated--the listener's expectations are based on this chord progression rather than the tonic-dominant relation of classical music.  When we use Roman Numerals, we give each chord a function and implicitly this gives the chord a meaning that it may not have in popular music.  A new way to analyze/notate chord progressions could perhaps focus more on root motion and less on identifying a tonal center.

* Categorize and analyze drum/bass rhythm: a lot of modern popular music have very intricate drum/bass rhythm combinations.  They're complex but I believe that through looking, we'll be able to find archetypes.

* Find a way to deal with the break down of pitch: increasingly we are seeing that the traditional idea of a pitch is losing ground.  In more and more music, we hear slides, drones, and all sorts of previously impossible aural sensations that are clearly not noise but are also not quite pitches.  To really analyze popular music, these sounds need a place in the system.

I don't really have a clue as to where to go with this which is why I'm posting this on Reddit!  If I had to guess, I'd say that part of the answer to this may lie with a greater understanding of the music production process and with tools such as spectrum analysis--the popular music we hear today is created in studios with microphones and DAWs; if we're to build a system of understanding popular music, we might as well start here.

* A basic understanding of how we build chords (a root, the third, and its fifth)
* The four generic types of chords (Major, Minor, Augmented, and Diminished)
* The existence of ""harmonic function"" in the chords I, IV, and V
* Your modes, or at the very least, the Major and Minor Scale

**What you're going to learn from this Guide:**

* The basic anatomy of a chord progression

* How to borrow from other scales/modes to enhance your progression

**The Anatomy of a Chord Progression**

At the core of our most common chord progressions is the existence of three functional components - a tonal center, a subdominant or ""predominant"" function, and a dominant function that confirms our tonal center. It's no mistake in the theory curriculum that we first introduce tonic, subdominant, and dominant first. It can become confusing, however, when we begin learning these functions through cadential examples that could be hundreds of years old. 

Also, our traditional education in these functions can sometimes give us a false sense of importance to progress from one sonority to another, exactly, as though there's a prescription to which we must adhere in our chord selection process. This is behind us by at least a century or more. Romanticism and Modernism have done well to break us of our dogged reliance upon any prescripts to the sonorities we use and when. 

The bottom line in TODAY'S music is that the rules have changed. Really, the rules themselves aren't even rules anymore. They are, however, good to understand for a historical perspective on how music has advanced. But whenever this question of chord progressions comes up, it's either because some DIYer or undergrad music major has somehow arrived at an impasse in their reasoning around harmonic function. There's either a sense that using a particular chord in a particular way is ""wrong"" or there's a sense of unstructured chaos in this that I find particularly unproductive.

So, let's get past this uncertainty in what we're doing with the tonal system. As we look at progressions today, there are some things that still appear to hold true to how we construct them. The tonal center, subdominant, and dominant functionality still appears to exist. It simply exists ""modularly"", in contrast to ""progressively"". 

Progressions of chords today don't always ""progressively"" move from I to IV to V to I. One example of this is the popular song progression - |I|V|vi|IV| which basically takes the primary functional form of |I|V|I|IV| - and there's good reason for why this progression is so popular. Actually, there are MANY reasons why this progression is popular, but the reason I'm most interested in exploring here is the ""modularity"" of this progression. Let's expand on this.

Suppose I want to write my song in Minor instead of Major. I might use the variant of the popular song progression in Major for my tune for its versatility - |i|VI|III|bVII| Now, it's a completely different set of roman numerals, but have we changed any of the chords? 

The answer is... No! We haven't. In fact, all we need to see is the ""relative position"" of these roman numerals in this key as they would relate to the ""relative Major"" of our key. This will look like |vi|IV|I|V|, which is the EXACT same progression of chords as our Major progression... but it STARTS with the 'vi' chord instead of 'I'. We can check this against any major or minor key as long as the major key is relative to the minor key or vice versa. 

* In C Major: ||I|V|vi|IV|| = ||CEG|GBD|ACE|FAC||
* In A Minor: ||i|VI|III|bVII|| = ||ACE|FAC|CEG|GBD||

This isn't a happy coincidence. It occurs because of the prominence of all pitches among the three structural chords of tonal music - I, IV, and V. In any key, these chords will complete a scale if extracted from their chordal structure and lined up consecutively. From CEG, FAC, and GBD, we can extract all pitches and line them up to make the C Major Scale - CDEFGABC. If such an ""anatomy"" of chord progressions exists, I, IV, and V are the skeleton that binds the body of the progression together. And 'vi', in the case of the popular song progression, isn't coincidental either, which we'll explore next.

**The Chords We Can Use: Anything Goes**

So far, we've introduced I, IV, V, and this 'vi' chord. And of course, it's all represented in roman numerals so we're still in highly ""theoretical"" territory, right? Maybe we were introduced to these in our theory curriculum, possibly even in this exact order. It makes sense to assume this, as most cadential figures in our tradition use these chords in highly prescribed ways. We have the plagal cadence, IV-I. We have the perfect, authentic cadence of V-I. We have the deceptive cadence of V-vi. But do we really understand how this transformed into the current conventional uses of these sonorities today? 

Truthfully, I don't know many theory curricula that transfer these sonorities to our conventional use of them. After breaking from the common practice in the early 20th Century, particularly with our study of Schoenberg, the discussion of contemporary tonal practices began to take a dive. But picking up where Romanticism and maybe Post-Minimalism left off, we can see a trend emerging in the past 60 years of popular music where the treatment of I, IV, and V remains largely intact... but with a twist. **EDIT:** The twist is that today, this approach to progressions allows us to work with ""modularity."" We don't necessarily have to think ahead about preparing our next ""key"" center. We can write a progression and plug it in where we want it to fit into our music simply by understanding the way I, IV, and V expand us out to other sonorities. 

A few hundred years ago, a theorist named Riemann proposed the ideas that all harmony can be reduced down to three fundamental structures based on the pitches they extract from a key and the distance of their roots from each other. The Tonic, our tonal center, is equally distant from its Subdominant chord below it and its Dominant above it. Basically, all harmony in music boils down to those three chords - I, IV, and V. Any other chord, in Riemann's early view, is a ""substitute"" of one of these three chords. For your convenience, here's a chart of these ""auxiliary"" chords up for grabs as they relate to their ""Primary"" chords:

* iii and vi are ""auxiliary"" chords to 'I'
* ii and vi are ""auxiliary"" chords to 'IV'
* vii^o is an ""auxiliary"" chord to 'V'

To think of it in a different yet convenient way, I, IV, and V are ""Parents"" with ""Children"". I and IV share a child - 'vi' - which is unique to the vi sonority in a key. It can be used with a high degree of versatility. In some contexts, it could substitute for a IV while in others it could substitute for I. Another notable thing about the children is their relation to their parents by ""common tones."" The iii chord shares tones in common with I in any key, two to be precise. 

But if anything goes, how do we account for sonorities outside the key? After all, in Major we have I, ii, iii, IV, V, vi, and vii^o . What if we're in the Key of C Major but we want to use an Eb major chord? How do we rationalize this with our existing roman numeral schema? This brings us to ""borrowing"" sonorities. 

**Borrowing from other Scales and/or Modes**

Any scale is a mode. Understand that the C Major scale is merely the Ionian mode built on C. In today's terminology (this is different than when you first encounter the church modes, and there's a long history behind it, so this is going to be very general and not entirely accurate), there are six primary modes we use. Our most common ones are Ionian and Aeolian, or Major and Natural Minor respectively. But we can divide the four remaining modes between being ""Major"" or ""Minor"" by the presence of a Major 3rd or a Minor 3rd (b3) above the tonic. So, we can say that when we're presented with a I-bIII progression that we have ""borrowed"" that bIII ""from Minor."" 

This is more case-in-point with the bVI, which we borrow really as frequently as anything else. The bVI comes from Minor. So, in a progression of C Major, if we end up with I-bVI, we've borrowed an Ab Major chord that would result from the pitch collection of C Minor. In fact, when it comes to evoking modes, this is exactly what we do - we borrow from the mode we wish to evoke. 

Suppose we want a ""lydian"" sound in C Major. This is easily achieved by borrowing the #4 from C Lydian. Of course, this makes our IV chord a #iv^o chord, which loses its impact but could still work. Our better choice to keep the consistency of our progression intact is to use the II chord, which results from the same #4. Thus, when you see a progression of CEG to DF#A, this I-II progression is effectively a ""lydian"" progression. 

This works in minor as well. For example, in ""Eleanor Rigby"" by the Beatles, Lennon uses a popular Dorian progression of i-IV. Why is this specifically ""Dorian?"" Because Dorian is a Minor Mode, and in Minor, we expect our Subdominant sonority to be minor - 'iv' - not IV. But in Dorian, we raise the 6 back to its natural state as it would occur in Major. This returns our Subdominant to a Major sonority. We say the IV in minor is ""borrowed"" from Dorian. Similar, we'd say the bII in Minor is borrowed from Phrygian, and we'd say the bVII in Major is borrowed from Myxolydian. These sonorities can be substituted, just like ""children of parents"", for I, IV, or V strategically or intuitively depending on how one writes music.

**Summary** 

You should be able to take this and apply it to understanding any tonal progression. Take this as an example: |I|bVI|II7|bVII| With our understanding of Primary Chords, we can easily reduce this to a Skeleton of I-I(or IV)-IV-V based on what we know about substituting Auxiliary (Child) chords for Primary (Parent) chords. And this should serve you well in a variety of areas both in writing and studying tonal music from a variety of recent (and not-so-recent) styles. The one thing I hope, though, is that this serves to help all those asking about Chord Progressions here in /r/musictheory.

Billy West, one of the main voice actors says ""hey that's a perfect fifth.  the subways use a perfect fifth sound"" or something like that.  I forgive him for being wrong, but it got me thinkin'.

A descending major third makes sense in this case.  It's ""happy"", and since it's descending, it has a sense of finality.  My brain hears it as the third then root of a major scale.  Without other context, I'm guessing this is how most hear it, though I can *make* myself hear it as the seventh and fifth, or the fifth and third of a minor scale.

I think you get an ascending major third when the doors open, which would make sense, but I'm not sure.

When you press the button to call a flight attendant on United flights, you get a descending *minor* third.  For some reason I hear it as the fifth and third of a major scale.

When you plug a usb driver into a windows machine you get an ascending perfect fifth (the beginning of something).  When you remove it, you get a descending fifth (finality).

Pitch identification can be learned, but this is not called perfect pitch, it is pitch memory, and your'e basing it off of previous songs or notes you have ingrained your memory.  There is nothing scientific about this approach, it is merely practice.

I don't see an upside to perfect pitch.  If you're a composer like me, you can also write music without having a piano in front of you.

I'm not comfortable talking about the schools I attended because my curiosity could be perceived as criticism toward them, which is not my intent. 

As a composer, I am simply in love with the aesthetic of Post-Romanticism (what I would consider to be the aesthetic sound of Film Scores and other Popular Music styles, generally). I don't know if it was intentional, perhaps a pedagogical issue I'm unaware of (as I haven't pursued a Doctorate), or if it's just a class that wasn't offered at any of the schools I attended, but I don't recall having the opportunity to study the principles behind this style of music in undergrad. Furthermore, in Masters work, I believe I experienced this overwhelming push toward post-tonal music (a.k.a. Modernism, Post-Modernism, and composers ranging from Berg to Stockhausen). I even attempted to adapt my writing to this, which actually resulted in the entire composition faculty essentially conferring with one another on whether or not to even ""allow"" me to include some works in my portfolio. Ultimately, the answer was, ""No."" It was actually quite humiliating and extremely frustrating.

Basically, my whole experience could be summed up like this: Any attempt on my part to engage in writing or studying the harmonic language of popular styles of music seemed quite ""taboo."" Is this a justified assessment, or did I just miss something? I'm especially perturbed that my theory curriculum set me up with an analytical method that, in my experience, I've never really found particularly useful in understanding popular forms of music today. For example, I learned about key, harmonic function, and modulation using Bach Chorales. This is of almost zero use to me in understanding most harmonic progressions in popular music today, mostly because none of those conventions seem to exist any longer. I don't see the use in setting students up by teaching them a concept using conventions that are no longer common. That seems, to me at least, a form of obsolescence. 

If it seems vague, let me be more specific. I went on my own, personal quest to study scores. I began with Wagner's chromaticism in the Tristan Prelude and Liebstod. I found whatever scores I could find of film music and studied what living composers have been doing. I've applied most of what I've learned from that to learning about progressions and melodic writing in popular songs. And I think many of the concepts from the theory pedagogy I experienced in undergrad and grad school are still applicable. However, I don't believe the way they are delivered in the theory courses I took are particularly useful. 

For example, I see how the concept of ""modulation"" makes sense in today's music, but modulation today isn't limited to strictly V/key relationships. In fact, V/key is much less common than mediant relationships today. At the risk of overstating it, V/key almost defines classicism where mediant relationships tend to be more prevalent in popular music today. But in my experience learning theory, modulation was almost exclusively taught as V/key. I almost felt like I was just ""making s**t up"" when I started looking at popular music that modulates through mediant relationships. 

I could really go into a number of other things, but there's one more issue I think I really should address in this ""suspicion,"" that of harmonic progressions and how we learn to build and/or analyze them. I learned to analyze based on sonorities. I learned in undergrad that 'I' is a sonority, it can go to any other chord; V is this other sonority, and it either goes to 'I' or 'vi'; and in between this, we have these ""sub-dominant"" or ""pre-dominant"" chords that can fill in the space between the beginning of a phrase and the end (the cadence). 

Okay, that's great. BUT, that's not actually the best explanation of it in my opinion. Those who read my comments and debate me regularly here are familiar with my favor of Riemann - and you're probably sick of it, sorry for that - but it seems like several times when there's a question about a chord progression, or about modes, or about things generally related to popular music, the explanations are much simpler when explained in ""parent/child"" relationships than through traditional terms like ""Tonic, Pre-Dominant, Dominant."" 

I don't say any of this to toot my own horn or to leave anyone with the impression I look down on anyone here (and really, I feel rather ""inferior"" to most of the folks here with legitimate credentials while I've been piece-mealing my own way through learning music theory - DIY-style). I just find I'm often ""repeating myself"" with my responses to these questions. I'm suspicious that the theory pedagogy out there that we have all learned from could be (not an accusation, just speculation) omitting information that would make our lives easier if it were just taught in the beginning theory courses. I don't really think it would be difficult to achieve this either with a simple ""alphabet"" of sonorities (for lack of a better word for it) that accounts for all the basic components of harmonic relationships. I think Riemann's approach is a really effective way to address this, not as an hierarchy of function but as a parent/child kind of relationship between sonorities... like a parent/child relationship between Tonic and its children, Mediant and Sub-Mediant, for example... or Sub-dominant, it's step-child Sub-Mediant, and it's legitimate child, the Supertonic. 

Maybe I just missed a big chunk of this in my own education experience, but it seems like many others did as well. Or maybe I'm just making s**t up and none of this is pedagogically reasonable. I honestly defer to your better judgment as professionals with much more experience than I have in theory education. The culmination of this suspicion - the big picture, so to speak - is that there was at some point a deliberate effort to almost ""remove"" these harmonic principles from the theory curriculum, perhaps as a reaction to Modernism. This is complete and utter conjecture, and I have no real ""proof"" that it actually happened. It just seems like it was there at some point, those who were lucky enough to learn about it and explore it brought it to life in Film and Commercialism, generally, and in many other areas, schools just outright eliminated or compartmentalized it in some obscure ""survey"" course. 

Is any part of this suspicion at all legitimate, or am I just making s**t up and lamenting over something that has no genuine basis in fact? Really hope you'll read this as a curiosity, not a criticism. I just want to understand what's going on, and maybe your perspective will illuminate, validate, or reconstitute my views into something (more) rational. Thank you for your time, and I hope it's interesting enough for you to dedicate time, thought, and potentially a response.

_______________


There has been some, in my opinion, misplaced rage against the curriculum of core theory courses that all undergrads have to take. I think it stems mostly from the question, ""Why do we have to take theory?"" or maybe, ""What is the purpose of the assignments we complete in theory?"" People often question why they have to learn the ""rules"" of partwriting when composers don't follow them, and why so much emphasis is placed on common practice music when music being composed today does not use common practice music. 

**I. Core theory classes do not exist to teach you how to compose.**

Yes, very often we teachers give assignments that involve model composition or partwriting. But the purpose is actually just to approach the subject material from a new angle, not to teach you how to become a composer. It's like in history class, you might have to write an essay, but it's not to teach you to become a novelist—it's to show that you understand the material enough to explain it coherently and clearly. 

Asking students to do model compositions is to test to see if the students are familiar enough with the concepts to produce them on their own. As you probably know, it's *much* easier to point to a proper chord progression in a minuet than it is to write your own. Of course, we ask you to do analysis too because that is also important. But teaching the same concept from multiple angles ensures complete understanding.

**II. Yes, we are aware that there is much more music out there than common practice era music and serialism.**

Unfortunately, The Problem of the Canon goes much deeper than a Theory IV class might let on. I think all theory teachers wish that we had enough time to include representative examples of many different genres. As you can see from my flair, I am myself an advocate for popular music analysis. But there are several things at play here that make it so that our repertoire list stays more or less consistent.

1. When you graduate from music school, everyone expects you to have this base knowledge of how to analyze common practice era music as well as serialism/sets. If you go on to graduate school and take placement exams and fail these areas, they assume that you did not have a good undergraduate education, for example, and you'll have to take remedial classes that will slow down your progress toward your master's degree. *All* schools in the US would have to agree to change the canon in order for the canon to be changed.

2. There are only 4 semesters/6 quarters to work with, here! We don't have time for everything. Some of you probably already think that theory is too fast-paced and wish it could be slowed down, but there just isn't enough time. Therefore, these other repertoires like jazz, film music, *real composition lessons/classes*, and so on get relegated to upperclassmen electives. You still probably will get the opportunity to learn these things if you want to!

3. Common practice era music is studied because this is the repertoire that is most often performed. Yes, you personally may prefer to play Ravel or Adams or Rorem or whoever, but if you get a position in an orchestra or teach high school orchestras, 80% of the time you're going to be playing Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, etc. (or if you're a band director, people who write like those guys), and those guys more or less use the kind of techniques you learn about in theory class. Therefore it's the most relevant to your future career to be familiar with these styles.

4. Regarding serialism, I personally think this is a good thing to include in everyone's education precisely because it's a genre that seems so inaccessible. It isn't until you've taken a class on it and learned *what* to listen for that you can come to appreciate atonal music, because yes, it is not as transparent as tonal music. But if you approach atonal music with an open mind, you can find new ways to listen to enrich your experience. You might not go home and jam to Schoenberg on iTunes, but at least your mind will have expanded enough to learn what there is to be appreciated, as well as hopefully why that style existed and was such an important movement in 20th-century music (yes, even though strict serialism is rarely used by composers today). And don't you want to be able to comprehend as much music as possible?

editing to add here: I hope it's implicit in my comments, but it seems to not be clear to everyone. I do not think that the music studied in Theory I–IV should be the *only* music a student studies. Of course I want them to learn about as many repertoires as possible. But with limited time, we have to prioritize some things over others.

**III. A bit of a tangent regarding issues with the inclusion of popular music, in particular**

At the last Society for Music Theory national conference in New Orleans, at the Popular Music Interest Group session, we discussed the issues with incorporating pop music into theory curricula. Two main concerns arose: 

1. Popular music often doesn't abide by rules, and thus it's hard to hold up any pieces as exemplars of various concepts. For those pieces that do fit the criteria, wonderful, and they may be used, but at the same time it sort of misrepresents popular music to pretend that that's the norm.

2. If you are hoping to include pop music to make class more relatable to students (the old ""this is what kids are listening to, not Mozart!"" argument), keep in mind that not all undergrads listen to the same pop music, especially in the age of Youtube and Spotify. Plenty of people enjoy pop music and are barely aware of Top 40 music, or Radiohead, or the Beatles, despite how much those examples may seem like common knowledge.

I might think of more later, but I hope to at least explain that we theory teachers *are* aware of these problems, have considered them, and have ultimately decided that despite its issues, the theory curriculum needs to stay more or less the same. 

I'm excited to have discussion on this and clarify any points.

I am not a bass player myself but I have been interested in the walking bass phenomenon very much, because 1. it's awesome and 2. I'd very much like to understand what the other musicians are doing! Although theres plenty of information on the net about this subject, there are a lot of contradictions and unclear topics. 

My questions are, what are your theory's on walking bass in a jazz context, regarding harmony and melody? For example, some people say you should use the root on the ""1"" beat of the measure, other people say a chord tone is sufficient, but doesn't that make the chord different in terms of function? Also, how do you guys handle chromatics, do you always approach the tone on the ""1"" by a half stap higher or below? and what difference does it actually make to use chromatics or scale tones on the ""2"" and ""4"" beats?",,False,,t5_2qrjj,False,,,True,t3_qupyt,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/qupyt/jazz_walking_the_bass/,

The second to lowest A on a piano is A1, which has a frequency of 55 Hz. This frequency is perceptible to humans.

The lowest note on a piano is A0, which has a frequency of 27.5 Hz. This frequency cannot actually be processed by many human brains, so the lowest thing you actually hear is the first overtone, which is the octave at 55 Hz.

This means that, although A0 doesn't have any lower perceptible tones than A1, we still hear the A0 as a lower pitch because of the way our brain hears the harmonic series.

Remembering, and Using Your Scales",,81,11,39,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/mwbay/music_teacher_here_with_a_quick_start_guide_to/,"So, there are plenty of things to know about music theory. I've been learning about this stuff now going on nearly 15 years and still don't know everything. That said, there's a lot that I do know as a composer, as someone with a masters degree in music, and now as someone with teaching experience. Here's a lesson I think everyone interested in learning this stuff can benefit from.

**Memorizing and Using Major/Minor Scales in Music Theory**

There are plenty of ""process-"" based ways to construct a Major Scale on any note - the Whole-Step/Half-Step orientation and so forth - but in my experience, there's a better way to learn this stuff through memorization that becomes much more useful. First, let's start with the patterns you should commit to memory.

**Memorize the Following**

* C/D/E/F/G
* Db/Eb/F/Gb/Ab (Enharmonic Spelling - C#/D#/E#/F#/G#)
* D/E/F#/G/A
* Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb
* E/F#/G#/A/B
* F/G/A/Bb/C
* F#/G#/A#/B/C# (Enharmonic Spelling - Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db)
* G/A/B/C/D
* Ab/Bb/C/Db/Eb
* A/B/C#/D/E
* Bb/C/D/Eb/F
* B/C#/D#/E/F

Take some time and commit these patterns to memory, including the two enharmonic spellings of Db/C# and F#/Gb. They will become increasingly useful in learning about harmonic progressions later. Generally, these are good for reading music as well, so being able to recognize these patterns on the staff is also huge. Take some time and write these patterns out on staff paper. Spend an average of 3-5 minutes per day for the next few weeks doing this in front of a keyboard:

1. Play all 12 patterns on the keyboard. These patterns are five notes a piece, so assuming you have five fingers you can do it with one hand while using the other to... who knows, channel surf or something. 
2. Write out all 12 patterns on staff paper using accidentals - #'s (sharps) and b's (flats).
3. Write out the Enharmonic spellings of the F#/Gb and Db/C# patterns. You might also go an extra step to learn the Enharmonic spelling of B/C#/D#/E/F# and of Ab/Bb/C/Db/Eb because you'll eventually come up against these spellings later.

**Combining Patterns to Create Major and Minor Scales**

To construct a major scale from any of these patterns, follow this simple process:

Example 1: The Eb Major Scale

1. Begin with the Eb 5-note pattern - Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb
2. Add the pattern corresponding to the last note of this pattern - in this case it's Bb, so add Bb/C/D/Eb/F.
3. Now, omit the last note - F - and you have the Eb Major scale. 

This becomes increasingly easier to do, from memory, without having to count whole steps and half steps every time you make a scale. You'll simply KNOW what an Eb Scale is, what it looks like, how it breaks down into two parts, and conveniently enough, it's a good lead into introducing yourself to harmony as the first chords you'll begin learning about come from these two patterns you combine to make a scale. 

Now, on to Minor Scales and how to construct them using these 5-note patterns. We'll turn the Eb Major scale into Eb Minor:

1. Begin with our Eb 5-note pattern and lower the third note by a half-step. The last two notes will overlap with the next pattern we'll add.
2. In this example, we've changed Eb/F/**G**/Ab/Bb to Eb/F/**Gb**/Ab/Bb
3. The Gb tells us what pattern to combine here. We end up adding Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db. All we have left to do is cap the scale off with our Eb at the top. This gives us Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db/Eb.

IMPORTANT NOTE: When building scales at the beginning level here, always follow the Alphabet in order... in the case of Eb Minor, some might have tried to write this as Eb/F/F#/G#/A#/B/C#/Eb. While this will sound correct, on paper, this will lead to many incorrect answers in theory class when applying scales. Notice how the way I spell the scale, Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db/Eb uses each letter of the alphabet in consecutive order with no gaps or redundancy. This is important for accuracy on tests and so forth.

**Building More Scales**

From knowing your Major and Minor Scales, you can construct nearly every scale you'd ever need to know apart from creating your own scales. For example, the Minor Scale can deviate in two ways from the way we initially come up with it. Fortunately, the way you build a Minor scale using these patterns gives you the Natural Minor scale for each pitch. The other two forms of the scale are Harmonic Minor and Melodic Minor. These only deviate on the 6th and 7th notes of the Natural Minor scale as follows. We'll keep using Eb Minor as our example:

Eb Major - Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb/C/D/Eb

Eb Natural Minor - Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/Db/Eb

The Eb Harmonic Minor returns the **7th** pitch of the scale back to the Major mode. In this case, we simply raise Db back to D natural:

Eb Harmonic Minor: Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/Cb/**D**/Eb

The Eb Melodic Minor returns **both the 6th and the 7th** pitches of the scale back to the Major mode. So we change Cb to C and Db to D and end up with...

Eb Melodic Minor: Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/**C**/**D**/Eb

And you can actually compare these two variations of Minor against the Natural Minor and Major Scales to see that the notes that change through each orientation are either the third, sixth, or seventh pitches of every scale. Take a look starting with Natural Minor and working Backward to Major, more or less:

Nat Minor: Eb/F/**Gb**/Ab/Bb/**Cb**/**Db**/Eb

Har Minor: Eb/F/**Gb**/Ab/Bb/**Cb**/**D**/Eb

Mel Minor: Eb/F/**Gb**/Ab/Bb/**C**/**D**/Eb

Eb Major: Eb/F/**G**/Ab/Bb/**C**/**D**/Eb

Music theory is a breeze when you understand your scales and the patterns that occur between them. If you understand this stuff, you're considerably further ahead already in your studies and preparation.

**Using Scales in Music Theory and Analysis**

Now, how is this useful? With these patterns under our belt, there is a great deal we can begin to explore in the basics of music theory. For example, **major/minor/augmented/diminished intervals** are a pretty big hurdle for some to overcome. Let's suppose we're asked to determine what is the interval from C to E... well, that's just all too easy if we know the scale:

C/D/E/F/G - First five notes of C MAJOR - C to E is a Major Third. 

And what about larger intervals above the 5th, like the 6th or 7th? How do we figure out whether Eb up to Cb is a major 6th or a minor 6th? If we know either the Eb Major or Minor scale, this is no problem at all...

Eb/F/G/Ab/Bb/C/D/Eb - since Cb is a half-step lower than the C in the Major scale, it's a Minor 6th. We can confirm this by constructing the Eb Minor scale on the fly in our head - Eb/F/Gb/Ab/Bb/**Cb**/Db/Eb - and there you have it. We can also recall how Natural Minor moves to Harmonic Minor, then to Melodic Minor, and then to Major. 6ths and 7ths aren't difficult at all when you have a context to work with.

**Working with Perfect, Augmented, and Diminished Intervals**

With intervals, you'll learn that there is a pattern in music where some intervals - specifically Perfect Intervals - are neither Major nor Minor. In our five note patterns, the fourth and fifth notes are considered ""Perfect"" intervals - Perfect Fourths, Perfect Fifths, and there is also the Perfect Octave, which is simply the top note that repeats the bottom note of any major or minor scale. You don't need to understand why this is the case until well after you have this under your belt, so we're moving on for now...

Perfect intervals can also be lowered by half-step (we call this ""Diminishing"" the interval) and can also be raised by half-step (we call this ""Augmenting"" the interval). Any interval can be augmented. Unison intervals cannot be diminished. 

In theory, you can have a Diminished Third by lowering a Minor 3rd an additional Half Step. Similarly, and again in theory, you can have an Augmented Third by raising a Major 3rd by a Half step. This can become ridiculously frustrating to remember without having something from memory to work with... like a scale or a couple of small patterns we can use to construct a scale in our head on the fly.

Suppose we're asked to write an augmented fourth above the pitch G... this is VERY EASY to do:

G/A/B/C/D - Fourth note is C, we just raise this note a half step to C#. 

How about an augmented third above F? Here's an example:

F/G/A/Bb/C - raise the third note - A - to A#. You can see that Augmented thirds sound exactly the same as perfect fourths - A# sounds exactly the same as Bb. 

How about a Diminished 5th? You'll see these a LOT...

G/A/B/C/D - lower the perfect 5th above G, in this case D, to Db. There you have it. 

And maybe you have to DIMINISH a 7th, ridiculous, I know... let's use G again...

G/A/B/C/D/E/**F#**/G - the 7th of this scale is F#, it is a Major 7th, we have to lower it once to make it Minor, so we remove the sharp. Now it's G to F natural, a Minor 7th. Let's make it a diminished 7th by lowering it again by a half step to make it - Fb - and now G to Fb is a diminished 7th.

This is really, really simple if you know every 5-note pattern and can construct the scale. It doesn't take a very long time to memorize these patterns either, and I know this from experience from teaching 5th grade beginning percussion students how to play ALL of their scales on keyboard (Marimba, Xylophone, Bells, etc.) within roughly 6-8 lessons on average. The best way to do this is in front of a keyboard and with staff paper. 

I know this has been long, and I appreciate your taking the time to read all the way through. If you feel overwhelmed, don't worry, I just dumped almost all AP music theory on you in a single Reddit post (omitted basic harmony for now, can add later when I have time). If this helps you out, post comments and let me know. If you think there are ways I can improve this, by all means I welcome your feedback. Happy learning!

He’s got an impressive array of tricks up his sleeve, and I want to talk about one of them: he achieves what you might describe as an “artificial modulation” in combining Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” and M.O.P.’s “Ante Up (Robin Hoodz Theory).” 

(I’m focused just on harmony, but I’d be remiss if I didn’t at least mention his slick metric reinterpretation of the familiar Beyoncé song.)

**First**, a few comments about the individual songs. “Single Ladies” is in E major; the repetitive hook “If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it” stops on scale degree 2 (F-sharp) over and over; the line traces a 5-4-3-2 descent that leaps back up to 5 after each iteration, depriving us of tonic (Schenkerians: now put your hands up)

Ante Up (Robin Hoodz Theory) features a brass/sax backing loop. It’s in F minor (with major IV mixed in), but Gregg speeds up the sample, lifting the pitch up to F-sharp. So when we hear it in All Day, we have a repeated F-sharp in the alto, a clear, steady descending line in the tenor (F# - E – D# - D-natural), and a rising bass line (F – A – B – D).

**OK, now about this “artificial” modulation**. The whole process begins at [2:44](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ovlm_Q2r4#t=2m44s) in the third track. We get a statement of Beyoncé’s “All the single ladies” call-and-response, plainly establishing E major. But as that chorus ends the M.O.P. sample fades in on a sustained F-sharp.

This gives us a tonal disjunction around [2:55](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ovlm_Q2r4#t=2m55s) – Beyoncé singing her verse in E major (“Up in the club, just broke up,” etc.), while the brass loop fixates on F-sharp. Gregg lets that friction cruise for about twenty seconds before he grinds into the dissonance even more at [3:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ovlm_Q2r4#t=3m14s) - the brass cling to the nagging F-sharp while Beyoncé insists on E major (especially at the “Whoa-oh-oh” arpeggios).

The magic happens at [3:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4ovlm_Q2r4#t=3m34s). Just as Beyoncé gets back around to “If you liked it…” the descending brass line reappears.  The 5-4-3-2 descent now sounds like 4-3-2-1 in F-sharp minor! The time we spend in this faux F-sharp minor is tantalizingly brief, but nonetheless spectacular.

Specifically, I wanted to know why lyrics can ""fit"" in certain places. And I think I'm on to something. *Disclaimer: Most of what is written below is purely my speculation.*

In linguistics, another subject I study independently, spoken language has a sort of musical quality called ""prosody"" and it is composed of three parts:

* Isochrony, the timing of syllables;
* Stress, the emphasizing of syllables; and
* Intonation, the pitch of syllables.

A song's melody controls what pitch each syllable is, so intonation is rather obscured, but stress and isochrony play an important role in which rhythms are appropriate for given lyrics. The isochrony of English is *stress-timed* - stressed syllables are the same distance apart.

Take a sentence like ""I'm going to the bank tomorrow"". Say it out loud. You probably emphasized ""go"", ""bank"", and ""-mor-"". What you probably didn't notice is that the time between those syllables was the same, and you squeezed all the extra syllables in the time between. ""I'm **go**ing to the **bank** to**mor**ow.""

This timing of the stressed syllables creates a sort of rhythm, and it directly applies to music: *Stressed syllables typically fall on downbeats*.

In music, the rhythm is defined by tempos, time signatures, and measures, and it constrains where the downbeats fall in time, which is essentially where stressed syllables fall. When studying poetry, stressed/unstressed syllables are grouped into feet like trochees, iambs, dactyls, anapests, and so on. However, since measures start with downbeats, it's simpler to only consider the feet that start with stressed syllables. If / = stressed and u = unstressed,

* l = / = ""long"", for a single stressed syllable
* k = u = ""pickup"", for strings of unstressed syllables that appear at the beginning of a phrase
* t = /u = trochee
* d = /uu = dactyl
* p = /uuu = (primus) paean

The kinds of notes you use to write each of those feet generally depends on the time signature and the desired length of the syllables. This leads into my next point: given some lyrics and the stress divisions, how would you notate it? For brevity (and since I can't write music in this format) I'll use the following letters to denote note types: W = semibreve (whole), M = minim (half), C = crochet (quarter), Q = quaver (eighth), S = semiquaver (sixteenth). Brackets denote a tuplet.

In 4/4 time, a measure contains four downbeats, so technically you can fit up to four of the above feet in a measure (less if you add rests). On that note, we can give time signature a stricter meaning that's similar to the current one. 4/4 means each measure is four feet where each foot is a quarter note, and 6/8 (2/C.) means each measure is two feet where each foot is a dotted quarter note. 

Here are some examples from popular songs that help illustrate what I mean:

    Lyrics: Buy     it,     use     it,     break   it,     fix     it,
    Stress: /       u       /       u       /       u       /       u

    B: 1                 2                 3                 4

By this definition of time signature, we can see that a measure in 4/4 time often disguises itself as 2/2. Then again, perhaps it's a subjective observation; one might consider the 2nd and 4th beats of the following measures to have ""secondary stress"", and the scansion would therefore be 4 trochees instead of 2 paeans and would fit this definition of 4/4 time:

    F: d       -       -       d       -       -       |t      -       t       -          |(t)
    B: 1                       2                       |1              2                  |

(In that last example, ""-set"" actually starts at the end of the second measure, but since it's tied into the first note of the third (which is stressed), the syllable still sounds stressed.)

But this definition of time signature has some interesting implications. Technically, QSS QSS QSS QSS is four dactyls in 4/4 time, CQQ CQQ is two dactyls in 2/2 time, and MCC is one dactyl in 1/1 time. A combination of those foot lengths, like QSS QSS CQQ, would be more accurately 2/4 + 1/2; that is, two quarter-note feet and one half-note foot. A pattern like QQQ QQQ QQ, which in standard notation would only be obvious by adding accents to the notes, would be more like 6/8 + 1/4 (two dotted quarter note feet and one quarter note foot). A 3/4 measure with just a trochee, MC, is still 3/4, but you considered it to be a compound meter (1/M.).

So what's the point? I find it interesting to look at sheet music this way. I can take some sheet music and add additional time signatures everywhere to correspond with the feet in each measure. I also think being aware of these patterns can be useful in composition.

* If you're writing a parody of a song, you should replace the lyrics with ones that are not only identical in rhythm, but also in stress. For example, the Portal-themed parody of ""Making Christmas"", ""Making Science"", has a couple lyrics that clash with the original prosody and therefore sounds dissonant (to me at least): The original goes ""It's ours this time"", stress pattern u / u /, but the parody goes ""She's awake now"", stress pattern / u / u.

* Certain rhythms can be substituted without changing the prosody. In general, an n-syllable foot (that begins with a stressed beat and may be followed by unstressed beats, i.e., long, trochees, dactyls, and paeans) can be written as an n-note combination that fits in a beat, and the first note (which is stressed) can be tied from the previous beat. For example, the ""every"" in the second example (a dactyl) can be written as a triplet. Any QQ can be written as Q.S or (C Q), and doing this for every one gives the song a swing or shuffle feel.

This also raises some interesting questions:

* Isochrony is a property that's language-dependent. English and German (and I think Mandarin) are stress-timed languages, but French, Italian and Cantonese are syllable timed. Does this mean music is written differently? It doesn't sound right when you give every English syllable the same length, so it probably wouldn't sound right if you give French syllables varying lengths. Perhaps stress-timed languages have more machine-gun-like rhythms? Does a French translation of an English song sound weird?

* To what extent can these rules be sensibly broken? Try singing a song but offset all the syllables by one note. It sounds weird, right? Same notes, same lyrics, but wrong place: it's what I call ""prosodically dissonant"". Now offset all the feet by one beat. It sounds better, but still off; probably has something to do with the cognitive processes behind what we perceive as measures. Of course, sometimes it's appropriate to use a different stress pattern to create a slight dissonance. For example, ""somebody"" is / u u, but in ""Somebody I used to know"", it's given u / u, as if it were ""some body"", as well as u u /.

Here's the scansion of that line:

    L: Now     you're  just    some-   bod-    y       that    I       used    to      know.   Some-   bod-    y_______
    S: /       u       u       u       /       u       u       u       |/      u       /       u       u       |/
    R: Q       Q       Q       Q       Q       Q       Q       Q       |C      C       C       Q       Q       |C._Q-C.
    F: p       -       -       -       p       -       -      -        |t      -       d       -       -       |(t)
    B: 1                               2                               |1              2                       |1

But I challenge someone to write a good song that has terrible prosody throughout.

Anyway, I'm not even studying music formally, so I'd like some opinions on my observations on prosody in music. The related Wikipedia article exists but it's practically empty. For all I know, this topic could be studied to death, and I'm going about it in all the wrong ways, or it hasn't been touched on at all, and I have a very novel way of looking at it.

*Cue overdubbed voiceover, while pictures flash in the foreground*

G7: You know... I thought we had a nice relationship. We met in the first bar, and I thought we really hit it off, you know? And every night, we'd make Perfect Authentic Cadences... I would work my little B up to his root and... hey #?@% you, I'll be as graphic as I want! Anyway, anyway... After a few months, things started going downhill. He had late nights, I was tired... when we would cadence, it would always be Imperfect. The notes would move like they always did, but they were so false and scattered.

C: Hey, man, don't blame me. She brought this on herself.

Jerry: What do you mean?

C: Well what she didn't say was that when she was in college, she half cadenced every day. She did it with D, man! He was my second!

G7: Well can you blame me?! He was closer to me than you ever were!

C: Who else did you half-cadence with?!

*C and G7 sit down, still glaring at each other*

Jerry: Now, I'm gonna ask you both to talk to each other calmly, and to be honest. So we're going to get it all out in the open now. C, what was the worst thing you've done?

C: I... I experimented with borrowed chords.

*Ooooooooooohhhh*

Jerry: Now, now... hush. And G7?

G7: I... I once did a phrygian half-cadence.

*Boooooooo!! Boooooo!!*

C: That's disgusting, G7, that F was a MINOR.

Jerry: Now now! We're not here to judge. Now that that's all out in the open, let's talk.

Now, you've both been unfaithful, but that's in the past now. This point here is now a pickup note... a new beginning. C, all that G7 wants from you is a bit of love. Tell her that she's pretty. Let her know that you look forward to resolving her tensions.

And G7, what you have to learn from this is that because C is a tonic, he will naturally get lots of attention. Be understanding and trusting and C will always come back for your PAC.

C: You're right, Jerry. I'm sorry, G7.

G7: I'm sorry too... I'm so tense I'm going to PAC you backstage right now.

C: Oh you're damn right... I'm going to resolve you so hard... I'm going to double your tendency tones.

It was a nice mix of theory and ""write-from-the-gut"" style of composition. It has chromatic harmony, modal mixture, and some non-resolving dominants. For those of you who are aspiring composers, but aren't sure how to add theory knowledge into your process, maybe this will be useful. I think it's a pretty cool story about how I mix writing from instinct and writing with my head.

[A link to the finished tune for the impatient](http://soundcloud.com/brnz42/baxters-bounce) (As the bass is pretty critical for the feel, headphones or actual speakers are recommended). 

* This song started out with me messing around on my [cigar box](http://imgur.com/QNi78) [ukulele](http://imgur.com/Ri6XP) with a descending minor-third riff, landing on a major third, [like this](http://imgur.com/eM9LJ). Notice it's in the key of F, with a B-natural. Figuring I had something that was kinda cool, I decided I was borrowing the first chord from Lydian Mode, and decided to go from there. 

* Now that I had a basic idea, I decided to use this as a chord progression and start to build a melody. I figured Bdim-Amin-Gmin-F seemed reasonable, and matched the thirds I had been playing. Keep in mind, I tend to just figure out a skeleton of chords, and then make it resolve cleaner later (as you'll see). [I expanded my original riff, and made a little melody out of the chord tones](http://imgur.com/OeY32). At this point I knew I was writing a jazz tune, and just played by ear on my bass until I had something I liked. Yes it's simple, but I was far from done. 

* Since I wanted to make a jazz tune, I grabbed my ukulele and started playing the chords with 7ths to see if it would work, or if I should scrap it. I played Bmin7(b5), Amin7, Gmin7, F. I loved the sound of it! But something was strange. The voicing I was using for the Bmin7(b5) put the D on bottom (ukulele only has so many voicings, you see). At this point, I decided to rename the first chord Dmin6, as it really sounded like an alteration to the vi chord in the key of F. 

* This is pretty common practice, as jazz players really favor the dorian mode for minor chords, regardless of diatonicism. It's even used on the relative minor, as I was using it here. By playing Dm6, I was making explicit a commonly implied concept. This started to make the B-natural that I had started out with just by accident into a really hip note. 

* Now that the first chord had changed from a Bdim to a Dmin6, I decided to see what would happen if I changed the Amin7 to an A7, and really emphasize the D-minor as a temporary tonic. I started to play around with this progression: Dmin6-A7-Gmin7-F. I liked it, but wanted to make sure F sounded like tonic when we got there, so I added a ii-V-I at the end. [With a new progression, I expanded the melody](http://imgur.com/nRjCp).

* At this point I was almost done. Sine I was writing a jazz tune, I decided to use AABA form. For the bridge I decided I wanted to stretch the harmonic rhythm, so I took a page out of Charlie Parker's book, and decided to just use an open solo over a rhythm changes bridge (A7-D7-G7-C7). I made two changes, I made the D7 into a Dmin7, to again emphasize the relative minor relationship. I also added a C#dim7 in the last bar to lead back to the Dmin6 of the A section. This makes for a nice chromatic C-C#-D root motion. 

* That is pretty much it. I made two ending for the first riff, which added up to 8 bars, and added a small turnaround at the end of the first A. [I wrote out a complete lead sheet-pdf](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/12781582/Baxter%27s%20Bounce.pdf), then decided to record a demo.

* I recorded this in three quick takes in pro tools. First take was my walking bass line (I'm a bassist by trade), then I added some comping on the ukulele, and finally a melody and solo. All three tracks have some EQ and are sent to the same reverb, and the uke tracks have a slight chorus effect (more so on the comping, which is lower in the mix).

**Okay** this question is going to be really drawn-out and difficult probably. There are a lot of right answers to ""what are modes?"", and it depends on exactly what you're talking about, so **specify in your response whether you are talking about church modes, Greek modes, modern modes, modes as rotations of the diatonic collection or some other collection, etc. etc. etc. because they are all very different and you need to be very clear.**

I'm also submitting only this question for today, because it's a difficult question and I think it will get more quality responses if there aren't other questions today!

EDIT: At this point it might be beneficial to skip to the end of the link below and listen to the audio sample before reading about the ""trick"" that's being shown here. Notice your initial perceptions, then read about what's going on. 

[The Tritone Paradox](http://deutsch.ucsd.edu/psychology/pages.php?i=206) starts with computer-generated tones that are designed to be a specific note (ie C#), but not clearly any specific octave. If two of these tones that are a tritone apart (half an octave), some people will hear them as clearly ascending, and others will hear them as clearly descending. In truth, these tones are neither ascending nor descending, because they are ambiguous as to which octave they are in.

What's weirder is that people are internally consistent, and tend to hear the same tones as ascending and others as descending, which is almost like a form of perfect pitch. One person might always hear D#-A as ascending and G-C# as descending, and another person might hear just the opposite. And there's some evidence to believe that these differences might be regionalized and be related to speaking patterns (another point connecting the music and language centers of our brains).

I think it should be noted that music theory is NOT a system of rules for composing music, it is a system of guidelines for *analyzing* music. So the best way to ""use theory"" to compose is to listen to pieces that you really like, find the scores for those pieces, and analyze them. See what other composers have done, and then use those techniques in your own compositions.

Something I find to be a useful exercise is to find the score for a piece you like, and then compose a piece at the same time you are analyzing the other work.

[Here is a link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yDrtNEr_5M), not necessarily the best interpretation ever, just the best one I found in 5 minutes looking around youtube. 

So the other day I was trying to figure out what makes it sound so... epic, for lack of a better word. I worked out the chords, which are, for reference (apologies if there are any mistakes, inversions omitted):

#I iii IV I | ii V/V V7/V V | I V vi iii | IV I V7/V V
#I V (V V) | vi iii (iii iii) | IV | ii iiim7 I (I) | ii V/vi vi (vi)
#if repeating: IV I V7/V V, otherwise: IV I V I

Anyway, at least to my eyes, there doesn't seem to be anything particularly special going on in the chords (but differing opinions are welcome). So perhaps a combination of the chords with the melody, creating the right flow, plus the instrumentation (huge choir) is responsible. But that's a nebulous and hard to apply statement (the kind you'd write in an exam when you only have a general idea what's going on and are trying to sound as smart as possible)

I’m only writing about the first four bars because there’s way too much to talk about in the entire song – I have to limit the scope.  This progression is also used as the chorus, and provides an apt musical counterpoint to Smith's lyrics.  In this post, I’m going to highlight his advanced modulation techniques and his clever use of anticipations and suspensions.

&gt;*You come over with all of your friends*

&gt;*And all their opinions I don't want to know*

&gt;*And I'm looking over my shoulder*

&gt;*Booking away with nowhere to go*

.

~ KEY AREAS ~

First, let’s look at the badass way that Smith manipulates key center.  We start in D, and due to a cleverly placed anticipation on the last beat of meas. 1, we have a brief tonicization of G major.    But at the end of the measure, we have a bizarre passing chord like a Gm7, leading to Bb.  These two chords could be interpreted as a tonicization of Bb for half a bar, but I’m going to save time and argue that the Gm7 chord is a transition to a Predominant function in F major.

The F major switch, and then the subsequent transition back to D, makes the cadence especially gratifying.  Because D is the submediant of F, the V – I motion of the last measure acts *BOTH as a deceptive cadence leading to a MAJOR VI chord, AND as the return to the home key after a flurry of wild modulation.*

*How fucking cool is that?*

.

~ ANTICIPATIONS, SUSPENSIONS, AND HARMONY CHANGES ~

There are so many functioning non-chord tones, I don’t know what to call them half the time.  For instance, look at the last note of the second measure, the Bb.  On the one hand, it functions harmonically within a Gm7 chord.  However, that chord only lasts for half a beat, maybe a whole beat – one could argue it's just a transition chord to the Bb major of the next measure.  So it also functions as an anticipation tone, leading to the root of the following chord.  Many other anticipations function the same way in other measures, so it stands to reason this one would follow suit.

However, one could also make the case for the Bb as the first copy of the falling 4-3 suspension that comes before it in beats one and two.  This would meld the resolution of the first with the preparation of the second, forming a suspension chain.  If this is true, then the entire second half of the meas. 2 is theoretically Gm, and beat four is an unusual 3–b3 suspension.  Although its function seems far-fetched, the melodic contour of playing a note, repeating it, then descending mimics a common suspension chain.  And that motive is the basic building block of this progression.

It further demonstrates that Smith’s anticipations often act like suspensions, and his suspensions often occur at the same time as anticipations.  Some function as non-chord tones, others function as functional to passing harmonies.

.

~ CONCLUSION ~

Everything is not as it seems.  In true fashion, Smith has crafted a small masterpiece that seems nonchalant in its descending chromatic melody, but harbors strange modulations and surprising chord changes in every single bar.  In a song about apathetically despising others while secretly running from something just out of reach, Smith created a doozy of a chorus to fit his haunting lyrics.

.

**TL;DR: MODULATIONS BE CRAY.  FUNCTIONAL ANTICIPATIONS EVERYWHERE.  ELLIOTT SMITH’S A BAMF.**

We know that not everyone will like this decision, but in a sub of 12,000+ readers, it's impossible to make everyone happy all the time. Here are some brief guidelines on how we think flair will be used here.

##What flair **is**

* A way to show what you are interested in, so that people can more accurately judge your opinion on a given matter. (For example: mine says ""jazz, rhythm/meter, schenker"": you probably wouldn't want to take me as an authority on guitar tunings.)
* A way to differentiate among levels of education, which correlates roughly to the amount of time you've spent thinking about issues that come up a lot in this subreddit. It will also (we hope) help people better answer any questions to a level that's appropriate.


## What flair is **not**

* A caste system. Just because someone is a graduate student doesn't mean that they're automatically right on everything (though we may think that from time to time ourselves...). User flair is **not** intended to be some sort of ""upvote the experts only"" system, the way it is in /r/AskScience, for instance.
* The be-all, end-all of a person's knowledge. Just because a person doesn't list ""15th century mensuration canons"" in their flair doesn't mean that they don't know a whole lot about them. Similarly, just because someone has self-taught flair doesn't mean they're not highly knowledgeable on a given subject.


We hope that these guidelines will sever us well, and we're open to suggestions as well. But for now, I'm sure what you're all wondering is ""**How do I get some of that sweet colored text next to my name?**""

For many reasons, we've decided to go with a mod-implemented flair system, rather than a user-edited one. To that end, if you want flair, message us! (There's a ""message the moderators"" link above the mod box in the bottom of the sidebar, or you can [click here](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmusictheory). Alternately, you can just comment here. **Be sure to mention what level of education and what you want your text to say** (nothing outrageously long, please).

We won't ask for any sort of proof or anything, unless you're a graduate student, in which case all we ask is a detailed description of something you've been working on recently. This should be an easy way for us to judge, and doesn't have to be really complex (""I've been using Christopher Hasty's method to explore what 'begin' *really* means in Artie Shaw's ""Begin the Beguine"""" or something would suffice). Anything you send the mods is of course confidential.

I can't buy the fact that it's because it sounds good, because music sounds good dependent on familiarity. When the scale was originally developed, there couldn't have been any familiarity.

So the diatonic collection is inversionally symmetrical about D/Ab, which means that Dorian is an inversionally-symmetrical mode. The other modes have what I think of as 'sister' relationships:* Ionian and Phrygian being inversions of each other; Locrian and Lydian; Aeolian and Mixolydian. There is also a hierarchy of common scale degree relationships between sister modes: Dorian is perfectly identical to its 'sister' (7 common scale degrees); Aeolian and Mixolydian share 5 common scale degrees (1,2,4,5,7); Ionian and Phrygian share 3 (1,4,5); Locrian and Lydian share only 1 (1). This is so straightforward and musically potent that I'm sure there must be a conceptual framework for talking about this, and probably music written that takes advantage of these relationships (Bartok?). Yet I haven't come across the idea in what little post-tonal theory I've been exposed to (and in 20th c. rep. I gravitate more towards atonal than modal music).

*When improvising I like to treat these pairs as analogous to halves of a melodic minor scale.  

EDIT: I should clarify too that I realize there's lots of music that reflect this relationship, but only in an indirect way as far as I know. For instance, it's not hard to find composers inverting something like C D E F (first four notes of C Ionian) to C Bb Ab G (first four notes of G Phrygian), but that's just the motivic manipulation of a small set rather than the systematic use of (what I'm calling) sister mode relationships as an organizing principle in a modal-sounding piece.",,False,,t5_2qrjj,1361676163.0,,,True,t3_193on7,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/193on7/is_there_a_name_for_this_modal_relationship_andor/,

Like many others, I got into this song because of its mock English.  But I think some really neat things are going on in it musically.

The steady elements seem to be the chords/mode, and the drum rhythm.  The steady chords in the background allow for it, probably just an electric guitar doing steady 16ths.   I can't say I've heard the drum rhythm before, with the snare accent on the downbeat.

This allows for some unpredictable phrasing.  The horn line always comes in on the and of 1, but the singing lines, even the ones with backup singers, are all over the place.

1329169154.0,45,self.musictheory,po17a,Discussion wanted: a couple of my suggestions for improving r/musictheory.,m3g0wnz,57,12,77,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/po17a/discussion_wanted_a_couple_of_my_suggestions_for/,"Dear r/musictheory,

I have somewhat recently begun responding fairly often on this subreddit in an effort to improve it and make it a more informative place. There are a couple of things that I think would improve this subreddit greatly, and I'd like to bring them to the table for discussion.

**1) A more academic atmosphere.**

A quick glance at the subreddit will show you that an overwhelming majority of the posts are questions from less experienced musicians asking for help from more experienced musicians on various topics of music theory. Very rarely are these questions even matters of interpretation; usually, there is a clear-cut answer to the questions. *Note: I'm not complaining about this!*

To me, the purpose of this subreddit is very much like the purpose of r/askscience. People post on r/askscience to ask people who are more knowledgable than they are for correct, verifiable, scientific answers to their questions, ideally even backed up by citations. I think that r/musictheory would be greatly improved if we treated it as a more scientific or academic subreddit. I think people looking for answers would be happier if they knew that the people responding to them were giving them the right answers. 

Personally, I think it would be great if we could have flair for each user that indicated their relevant experience to the field. For example, mine would say that I am a graduate student in music theory. Perhaps someone else's would say that they are a high school band teacher, or that they teach jazz piano lessons. The point of this would be that whenever someone reads an answer to a question, they will know the perspective that the responder is bringing to the table, as well as their credentials. That's not to say that one kind of person's response will always carry more weight based on what flair they have; different questions are better answered by different types of people. Having flair that quickly and easily identifies the experience that a person has will help with this.

Along with this, it would be nice if people would engage in more scholarly conversation when commenting. If someone says for example ""actually, I don't think that term means what you think it does"", don't take offense or be stubborn! Think of it as a learning opportunity. Again, imagine you're posting in r/askscience and an actual scientist corrects you on some misinformation you have. Personally, I'd appreciate being corrected.

**2) Updating the sidebar.**

We get *so many posts* on this subreddit asking for intro materials for music theory, either websites or textbooks. Why not put this information on the sidebar? We could select a few websites and a few textbooks that we recommend. We could also even start discussion threads on that very subject (with the explicit purpose of being exhaustive) that can then be linked to from the sidebar. Then, we can point people to the sidebar when they have those questions, rather than rehashing the same discussion over and over again.

Also, there are a number of music research subreddits that probably have a similar audience as r/musictheory that are not listed on the sidebar. The ones I know of are [/r/transcribe](/r/transcribe), [/r/musiccognition](/r/musiccognition), and [/r/musichistory](/r/musichistory). Adding them to the sidebar will increase their subscribers, and ours if they reciprocate.

_______

**tl;dr: In this subreddit, I want to see...**

* **A more scholarly attitude in conversation**

Excuse any typos; I can't copy-paste and so I'm just typing it quickly.

&gt;*[beginning on pg. 197]* The whole question of the status of hte notion of the overtone ""system"" (surely not a system, but a phenomenon), the checkered history of this status for two centuries, and that of its predecessor—the divisions of the string, must occupy a central place in any discussion of musical theory. Naturally, since I am not concerned with normative allegations, I cannot be concerned here with the invocation of the overtone series as a ""natural"" phenomenon, and that application of equivocation which then would label as ""unnatural"" (in the sense, it would appear, of morally perverse) music which is not ""founded"" on it. Now, what music, in what sense, has ever been founded on it? Experimentally, the intensity of harmonic, and nonharmonic, partials in a spectrum associated with a given sound-source would appear to be an important determinant, but by no means the sole determinant, of what is ordinarily termed tone color. 

&gt;But what is, what can be, the status of the overtone series in a theory of the triadic, tonal pitch system? For it to furnish the criterion of the structure of the major triad it is necessary—first—to append the independent assumption of octave equivalence, for to assert that the overtone series itself supplies this criterion because the octave is the first interval above the fundamental, or the interval determined by frequencies whose ratio is a power of 2, et cetera, obviously is to adjoin independent assumptions of the euqivalence-priority of the first interval, or of the intervals determined by the power of 2, et cetera. Then, the independent assumption of the significance of the number 6, or 5, as that which determines the highest partial to be included as a specifically realized pitch, has required ""justifications"" which have ranged numerologically *[pg. 198 begins here]* from the number of planets to the number of fingers on the human hand. And again, the principle which permits one to proceed from the assertion that ""associated with a given frequency produced at a given intensity by a given instrument are other frequencies"" to the assertion that ""such other frequences always may be explicitly presented on any instrument simultaneously with a given frequency"" must be combined with another rule which prohibits this process from continuing, this principle then being further applied to the frequencies so explicitly presented.

&gt;And still, the structure of the harmonic series does not supply a basis for the status of the minor triad in tonal music. It either dissonantly ""contradicts"" i tor requires the invocation of still further assumptions of intervallic permutability or numerology. And yet, the succession of intervals in the overtone series does not correspond to the categorizations of ""consonant"" and ""dissonant"", even in relative terms, whether one asserts the independent assumption of adjacency or of relation to the first partial. Under the former criterionn, the fourth would be termed more consonant than the major third; under the latter, the minor seventh and the major second would be termed more consonant than the major or minor sixth, or the minor third. The concepts of consonance and dissonance have induced centuries of a comedy of methodological errors, from the rationalistic stage, through the so-called ""experimental stage,"" without its having been clear or inquired at any time as to the object of the rationalizing or the experimentation. Clearly, this is because consonance and dissonance are context dependent tonal concepts; it is impossible to assert that an interval is consonant aurally, since it can always be notated as dissonant, and this notation reflects a possible context. 

&gt;One can continue with the overtone follies, with what having the overtone series commits one to eat, but perhaps it is necessary only to point out that a theory compounded from statements descriptive of a body of representative works of the 18th and 19th centuries undoubtedly would include the concepts of the major and minor triad as definitional, and as instancing the property of consonance, which, wiht the property of nonconsonance, describes the two basic states of a composition which determine the modes of succession to the next state, octave equivalence classes (identical, in this body of literature, wiht function equivalence classes), the major scale (as completing independently the concept of consonance and providing the criterion for proceeding from state to state). These concepts hardly suggest the postulation of an overtone series as a master concept entailing them. 

Milton Babbitt, *The Collected Essays of Milton Babbitt*, ed. Joseph Straus (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2011): 197–198. This particular essay that I've excerpted was first published in 1965, under the title ""The Structure and Function of Musical Theory"".

**tl;dr: The overtone series, while not totally unrelated to the tonal system, is certainly not the *source* of the tonal system. There are more partials than just those that create the triad; octave equivalence must be assumed and cannot be supported through the overtone series; the overtone series does not explain the minor triad, nor the scale, nor chord functions.**

**What are modes?**

When people refer to modes, they refer to two things.

1. The church modes - the concept of these were developed from Boethius in the 6th-century and were tweaked and altered well through the 17th-century.
2. The modern conception of modes as diatonic scales that are created from being on a different ""white note.""

**What are the church modes?**

Church modes refer to the 8 modes that were created in a way to codify the Gregorian chant repertoire (they were meant to classify monophonic music.) The history of church modes is a long and complicated one, so I am going to summarize a ""spark note"" version my professor, Kyle Adams, has disseminated to his students.

1. The modes truly developed in Greece with the school of Pythagoreas. They determined basic theoretical premises we take for granted, such as defining intervals, a diatonic scale, and giving notes letters.
2. Boethius (5th century) translated this Greek theory into Latin. Unfortunately, he misunderstood Ptolemy's concept of mode and tried to connect it to his concept of eight modes.
3. Hucbald was the first to link the four finals of the eight modes to the letters D, E, F, and G. Each had an ""authentic"" version, starting on the final and divided at the fifth above the final (fifth+fourth). They also had a ""plagal"" version which started a fourth below the final and was divided at the final (i.e. fourth+fifth).
4. Whoever wrote *Alia musica* is probably glad to be anonymous! This person(s) conflated the word *modi* and *toni* (the psalm tones) since there were 8 of each. In addition, this person(s) reversed the numbering of the modes from Boethius...and somehow it stuck.

Break...now I can tell you the eight modes. These were developed and refined in the 400 years after said Anonymous to get the modes we generally refer to today as the church modes. **The final is listed in bold.** *The recitation tone (also known as the repercussa or psalm tone) is in italics and lower case*

1. Dorian: **D**-E-F-G-*a*-B-C-**D**
2. Hypodorian: A-B-C-**D**-E-*f*-G-A
3. Phrygian: **E**-F-G-A-B-*c*-D-**E**
4. Hypophrygian: B-C-D-**E**-F-G-*a*-B
5. Lydian: **F**-G-A-B-*c*-D-E-**F**
6. Hypolydian: C-D-E-**F**-G-*a*-B-C
7. Mixolydian: **G**-A-B-C-*d*-E-F-**G**
8. Hypomixolydian: D-E-F-**G**-A-B-*c*-D

Note: Though Lydian was understood as the F-F mode, it was almost always the case Bb was used in this mode. This will be explained later.

Then, trying to connect this to polyphony became a much harder task. Theorists like Johannes Tinctoris and Pietro Aaron basically said ""look at the tenor."" In the mean time, Heinrich Glarean comes by and says ""but wait! there are twelve modes!""

Glarean identifies ""Ionian"" and ""Aeolian"" as the C and A modes and their plagal partners respectively. He notes there is a mode from B-B, but it has to be rejected due to its properties (mostly the dissonant fifth.) Fun fact: He had a friend compose a piece in that mode. Not so fun fact: It doesn't sound that great nor does it sound that ""locrian."" Glarean also realizes that Ionian sounds a lot like Lydian, and basically says that no one writes in ""true"" Lydian.

Theorists after Glarean attempt to define polyphonic characteristics to determine mode, including the types of cadences you can expect. Let's just say...they all disagreed and no one was truly correct since they were trying to craft their theories around music already composed.

**Why Bb in Lydian?**

The church modes are based on the Greater Perfect System, which later ""gamut"" came to represent. The gamut represented all available pitches. When Guido d'Arezzo came up with solmization, a way to think about the tone/semitone relationship in the scale, he developed the hexachord ""ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la"". Between each of these notes in the hexachord is a tone *except* between mi and fa, which contains a semitone. Thus, when the hexachord was applied to the letter F, B is sung as a Bb.

Some composers began to distinguish between this ""soft"" b and the ""hard b"" (when B was a tone away from A.) The hard b was drawn as a b with rigid edges. This eventually developed into our ""natural"" sign in music. The ""soft"" b had rounder edges and looked very similar to a flat accidental. Eventually it developed to be this way.

As a result, almost every work in Lydian incorporates Bb, whether notated or not, since singers would have inherently known this note needed to be only a half step away from A. As a result, most works began to notate a signature of Bb for Lydian modes.

**Can the church modes be transposed?**

The answer is yes, but with heavy qualifications. For the vast majority of the time church modes were relevant, they could be transposed, but only a fourth down. This commonly would add a flat to the key signature (except in the instance of the Lydian modes which no longer needed a Bb in the signature). These ""transpositions"" were only achieved because some guy got the idea that the whole Greater Perfect System (i.e. the gamut) could be transposed down by a fourth.

Thus, you will (for the most part) not see these church modes in other keys other than this exception.

**Final note about church modes**

Works weren't necessarily composed in church modes--and definitely not akin to how composers composed in keys. Even composers who self identified what modes they were writing in were basing their modes from theorists who couldn't agree on how modes functioned in works. 

**What are the modern modes?**

The history of modern modes is a little less clear and how they developed. However, the concept of imbuing modal characteristics in keys other than the church modes can be seen in Baroque works.

There are seven modern modes. There are two ways to think about modern modes - one being as diatonic scales starting on different notes to the C-C scale. Thus:

1. Ionian - C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C
2. Dorian - D-E-F-G-A-B-C-D
3. Phrygian - E-F-G-A-B-C-D-E
4. Lydian - F-G-A-B-C-D-E-F
5. Mixolydian - G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G
6. Aeolian - A-B-C-D-E-F-G-A
7. Locrian - B-C-D-E-F-G-A-B

These modes, unlike the church modes, can be transposed to any key--thus rather than starting on C-C and figuring out what modes there are, one can think about the patterns of tones (T) and semitones (S).

1. Ionian - T-T-S-T-T-T-S
2. Dorian - T-S-T-T-T-S-T
3. Phrygian - S-T-T-T-S-T-T
4. Lydian - T-T-T-S-T-T-S
5. Mixolydian - T-T-S-T-T-S-T
6. Aeolian - T-S-T-T-S-T-T
7. Locrian - S-T-T-S-T-T-T

They can also be compared to the major (Ionian) and natural minor (Aeolian) keys and described with their characteristic tones:

1. Ionian = major
2. Dorian = natural minor + raised 6
3. Phrygian = natural minor + lowered 2
4. Lydian = major + raised 4
5. Mixolydian = major + lowered 7
6. Aeolian = natural minor
7. Locrian = natural minor + lowered 2 + lowered 5

The modern modes are identified first by the starting note of the scale, then the type of mode. For instance, Eb Lydian would be Eb-F-G-A-Bb-C-D-E, a major scale with raised 4.

As to what makes a composition in these modern modes--typically composers, song writers, and the like emphasize the characteristic notes of each mode (i.e. the ones that don't sound like major or minor keys). As to chord progressions in the modern modes, these are difficult to distinguish. **Modes are mostly a melodic phenomenon** thus identifying chord progressions in modes can be at times frivolous.

If you want to check out the first article, you can click [here!](http://www.violetpulse.com/guide-to-getting-into-classical-music-if-you-dont-know-where-to-start/)


There are six different periods of classical music, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century. We are focusing on the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic eras. In today’s blog post, we will explore the music and composers of the Classical period.


**Classical**

Following the flowering of music in the Baroque era under the guidance of masters like Bach, Vivaldi, and Handel, the Classical period saw the emergence of structured instrumental forms that we all familiar with: symphony, concerto, sonata, and chamber music. Unlike Baroque music, classical music featured shorter melodic passages, homophony (i.e. melody playing over a chordal accompaniment), and contrast in rhythm, dynamics, and keys.

 
Notable Composers


**Franz Joseph Haydn**


Known as “The Father of the String Quartet”, Haydn embodied the aims and goals of the Classical period. Haydn’s influential work helped evolve the sonata form and establish many core classical music concepts, which influenced many other composers such as Beethoven, Brahms, and Schubert.

“I was never a quick writer, but composed with great care and effort” – Joseph Haydn

 
[Farwell Symphony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQcj-tV52ow)


Symphony No. 45, First Movement: Symphony No. 45, otherwise known as the “Farewell” symphony, was written by Haydn in 1772 for his patron Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy while he and the court orchestra were at the prince’s summer home. Due to the unexpected length of their stay, many of the musicians were homesick. In a subtle attempt to suggest to the prince that the musicians would like to go home, Haydn wrote the last movement of the piece in a unique manner. In the final adagio of the piece, each musician would stop playing, snuff out their candle, and turn away, leaving only Haydn and the concert master playing muted violins.


[Surprise Symphony](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Cs_f3GupCo)


Symphony No. 94, Second Movement: Also known as the “Surprise” symphony, this piece is an example of Haydn’s devious humor. The sudden intrusion of a fortissimo chord, in a otherwise quiet passage, is stylistically typical of the sudden contrasts in dynamics Classical period music is known for, the unpredictably loud chords in Haydn’s piece were designed to wake up any members of the audience who fell asleep in the slower movements.

The lecture said something like this:
&gt;In counterpoint, one should watch with care the 'false relations'^1 : If, in two voices, one occupies the 7 and one the 5 and they move to a position where the 7 takes the 8 and the 5 takes the 4, there is a false relation between the 7 of the first voice and the 4 of the second voice.

Unfortunately, when I go to create something of my own, my head is crammed full of actual songs that already exist. When I try hard to focus on creating something new, it either sounds terrible or those thoughts sneak their way in to my concentration and I get another existing song stuck in my head. When I come up with a beat or melody that sounds good, I then realize how close to another song it is. 

The same goes with song writing. I write great poetry and creative stories, but when I write lyrics, I keep coming up with lines that are so close to other existing songs.

Black gospel music is a foreign language to me from a theory standpoint.

I can improvise around classical or basic jazz styles... because I understand what's happening.

However, when I listen to and even try to deconstruct black gospel music, my brain just falls apart.  Now there's no end to videos on youtube with people playing licks for others to learn, or even versions of songs, but none of them contain any theory, or the best, very basic.  It's far too common for me to hear someone in a video say ""play an F major here"" when what they are actually doing is playing is a well voiced F13(#11).  The important part isn't that he's playing an F major... it's that he's giving it that gospel color with the 13(#11)

Too often the parts are explained purely as slash chord (play a Bb in your left and a Ab chord in your right), or even just every note is spelled out.  This is the same when I go looking for tabs of heavily gospel songs.  There's a type of shorthand my wife and I refer to as ""gospel tab"" which is great if you want to learn exactly how a person voiced every chord, but is hard to read for a quick run of the song.

It's usually in a format like:

Eb | G Bb Db Gb

But for every single chord.

I need a way that my analytical, theory addled brain can digest what is actually going on in so much of this music.  What are the some good ways to think about how the chords are shaped.  What are key color variations used on parts of progressions to give them a certain color (i.e. what is added to a V chord in a given progression).

I see a lot of voicing where the bass is either a whole step higher or lower than a given triad in the right hand.  While I can think of it as a slash chord or think of it as some sort of extended tertian thing, it's hard to quickly wrap my brain around it in a way that is useful.

A good example of a video that I have trouble decoding is here.

If we generate the overtone series by dividing a string into successively smaller fractions (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.) then the undertone series is generated by doubling the string in the opposite ratios. This produces an inversion of the intervals of the harmonic series (C,C, F, C, Ab, F, C, D, etc.) and was used by Riemann and D'Indy to explain the existence of the minor chord, which is more tenuously related to the harmonic series.

Hindemith argued that the undertone series was purely theoretical because it had no effect on timbre the way the overtone series does, but Helmholtz argued (earlier) that undertones had just as much of a sympathetic resonance effect as overtones. Harry Partch based much of his compositional system around the interaction between the overtone and undertone series.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but this kind of progression/voicing is the only one where you can move from one chord within a scale to another (in the case of I-iii and IV-vi) by changing only one note by a semitone, which leads me to believe that it might have a name.

He hears the synth bell motif (the rhythm that 50 Cent copies in the chorus/hook when he says ""This Is How We Do"" in staccato notes) and takes a characteristic part of it (the placement of the 2nd note of the motif on the 2nd sixteenth note in the beat) and emphasizes it. In the following jimmied-up transcription of the first 8 bars in text, the capitalized word is the rhyme; when the rhyming word is bolded, it means that that word falls on that characteristic 2nd 16th note of the opening synth bell motif, and when the word is italicized, it means that the word falls right on the beat.

fresh like - **UH** / impala - **UH** / chrome hydraulics / 8-0-8 **DRUMS** / you don't want - **NONE** / n-- betta - **RUN** / when beef is on i pop that **TRUNK** / come get - **SOME** / pistol grip **PUMP** / if a n- step on my white air **ONES** / it's red **RUM** / ready here i *COME* / compton UH / dre found me in the **SLUMS**

This brings us to the end of his first 8. Notice that the rhyme the entire time has been on the syllable ""uh""; Game continues this for the next 8 (an incredible thing to do, and which he does in other songs as well.) Finally, note the phrasing of his rhymes: 1/2 bar, 1/2 bar, 1 bar, a 2 bar grouping repeated three times (for a total of 6 bars,) until the final two bars of the first half of his 16, when he accelerates the phrasing and has the rhymes divided into 1/2 bar, 1/2 bar, 1/2 bar, 1/2 bar. This same structure is used for the next 8, and propels us nicely into 50's verse. Note, finally, that in the final 2 bars (""It's red rum..."" until ""slums""), Game begins to vary where the rhyme falls metrically, starting on the word ""come"", which falls on the beat, continues with the word ""uh"" after Compton (which falls on the 4th sixteenth note of the beat), and stops with the word ""slums"", which also falls on the beat. In the next 8, Game will continue to anticipate and play off the expectations of the listener, just as any good music-writer does. His next 8:

sellin that *SKUNK* / one hand on my *GUN* / i was sellin' rocks when master p was sayin *UHHHHHHH* / buck pass the BLUNT / these G-Unit girls just wanna have **FUN** / coke and RUM / got weed on the *TONGUE* / i'm bangin' with my hand up her dress **UH** / i make her *CUM* / purple haze in my *LUNGS* / whole gang in the *FRONT* / case a n- wanna *STUNT*

As mentioned before, the phrase structure in the second 8 is the same as the phrase structure in the first eight, except for one thing. On the word ""UH"" after ""master p was sayin'"", he elides that 1 bar phrase into the first 2 beats of the next phrase, making itself really a 1.5 bar phrase, and eliminating the 1/2 bar phrase that came in its parallel structural position in the first 8 bars of his verse here. But what really interests me here is the metrical placement in the rhymes of ""uh."" Look back at the preceding paragraph, and see how the rhyme changes between being italicized (falling on the beat) and being bold (falling on the 2nd sixteenth note of the beat, a characteristic rhythm of the synth bell riff.) Game sets up the listeners expectation, begins to vary them at the end of the first 8, and in the second 8, varies it even further. The contrast is heightened by the fact that the 2nd sixteenth note of the beat in 4/4 is a highly syncopated place to put a note (which he does in his first 8 bars), which is very different from being right on the beat and not syncopated at all (an idea which he introduces in his second 8 bars.) By the middle of his second 8 bars, the listener has no idea where the rhyme will comes next; this is what makes it awesome. Now listen to Dre's production decisions. The drums (bass, snare, and high hat) all strongly accent the bar as discussed before. They contrast greatly with Game's continuing manipulation of the accent of his verse. This is why I can't listen to the song without bobbing my head: I'm listening for the accents of Game's rhymes against the driving rhythm of Dre's drums. Finally, listen to how Dre doubles Game's voice on the rhymes. He has decided to emphasize this contrast in accent. He knows some how or other that the music works like this too. This shows Dr. Dre using the supposed disadvantages of listening to music in headphones as an advantage. (For some reason, a lot of people object to rap on the basis that it can't be played live, and therefore can't be real art; what I think is that good producers, like Dre, simply take advantage of what recording does offer them, which is a stereo sound world that they can manipulate. Listen to Dr. Dre's vocal tracks, and you'll see what I mean. But that's for another time.) This is what I get out of rap music.

Also, I have the sheet music if anyone wants it.

Also, if anyone would like me to keep doing this (I'm working on an Eminem one,) or cares to do it themselves (which would rock), let me know!!!! :-)

Let me give you a little background. I study games development and for my final work I decided to make something related to music. My whole study is based in creating a game(puzzle more specifically) using the harmony concepts. The game should work as tool to study and memorize the chord formation.

I don't have many contacts with a good theoretical knowledge in this area, so I though you guys could just give me some feedback. I intend to use it in order to make some final adjustments before finishing my work.

Please let me know your opinion on it. 

Game: http://www.kongregate.com/games/fazzatti/chord-blox

ps.: Some people have told me that the instructions are not clear and it is not so intuitive, so I'm already planning to make an interactive tutorial mode to learn how to play. Just let me know in case you need me to clarify the instructions.

Here's my contribution!  First of all, this is hard.  I'm assuming the reader has a basic understanding of chord construction and intervals.  This is advanced material for the lay person but it is fundamental to music theory.  If you don't know anything at all about music theory some of it will be over your head.   This is a lot of work, and will take any but the most gifted student weeks to months to master.  Enjoy!

How many flats are in the key of Db major? 5, Bb Eb Ab Db Gb.  How many sharps in A?  3, F# C# G#.

What are the notes in a C major chord?  C E G.  What about F# minor?  F# A C#.  How about E7#9?  E G# B D F## (yes F## is the same as G, but there should only be one of each letter name, the 9th is F#, so the #9th is F## because there's already a G# in the chord).  


I just typed all that without looking anything up, playing an instrument, or singing.  Here's how I did it:

Step 1.  Memorize the circle of fifths.  Just do it.  Look it up on wiki.  Remember ""bead GCF"" if that helps you.  There's a thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/g3r7x/i_released_a_free_online_course_that_teaches_a/) with a lot of good comments about learning the circle of fifths.

Before I continue, just to avoid confusion, for the rest of this post if I say it's in C I mean C major.  If it's not a major key I'll specify.  


Here's my biggest tip for key signatures: 


When counting sharps, the last sharp you get to is always a half-step below the tonic.  G has an F#.  D has F# C#, A has F# C# G#, E has F# C# G# D#, etc...


When counting flats, the tonic is always the second-to-last flat you named.  So F has a Bb.  Bb has a Bb and Eb.  Eb has Bb, Eb, Ab.  Ab has Bb Eb Ab Db, and so on.

Step 2.  Memorize the ""circle"" of 3rd's.  Nobody calls it the circle of 3rds, but that's what it is.  Just memorize the letter names in order, ascending 3rds, like so:

A C E G B D F A C E G B D F A and so on.

Don't bother remembering flats and sharps, just remember the order.  This should be easy if you can read music, it's the same order as the lines/spaces of the staff.


All diatonic chords are spelled with notes in this order, period.



Step 3.  Memorize all of the chords derived from the major scale, and memorize them by number, upper case roman numerals are major chords, lower case minor,  vii^o is a diminished triad, like so:

I  ii  iii  IV  V  vi  vii^o  I  

This is exactly the same as:

C Dm Em F G Am B^o C

Commit this to memory.

Step 4.  Put it all together.  To spell a chord, you need two pieces of information, the root name and the type of chord (chord quality).  I'll use the example I opened with to demonstrate.

What are the notes of a C major chord.  All chords are spelled in thirds so right off I know that the letter names are C E G.  Next I note that the key of C major has no sharps or flats, so it's a major chord.  Next:

F major.  It's spelled F A C.  It's the IV chord in C major, so it's major.

What about an F# minor chord.  First of all the notes are F A C without accidentals.  Next up I know that F A C is the IV chord in C major, and therefore a major chord.  So F# A# C# is also a major chord, if I lower the 3rd I get F# A C#, F# minor.

How about E7#9.  This one requires that you know how a dominant 7th chord is constructed.  The letter names are going to be E G B D F.  With no accidentals (in C major), this is a minor7b9 chord, so we have to modify it.  G# gives us a major 3rd.  F is the b9th and we need a #9 so for that note a G would be played, but it's technically correct to call it F## (in any diatonic key there should only be one of each letter name, and either flats or sharps but never both, this excludes notes from outside the key of course).  The other way of looking at this one is to recognize that a dominant 7th chord is probably a V chord, so this chord could be in the key of A major or minor.  In A major we have F# C# G# so we can spell it E G# B D F#, then we have to sharp the ninth to F##.  A minor would be the same as C major, except using a G# from A harmonic minor, the F## is still chromatic.

The general idea is, you see a chord, you spell out the letter names of the notes present, then you modify those notes according to either the key signature or your knowledge of how chords are spelled, referencing everything to the chords in C major to determine chord quality.  


TL:DR:

Understand basic chord construction and intervals before starting.

Memorize the circle of 5ths to learn how key signatures work.

Memorize the ""circle of 3rds"" as a tool to spell chords.

Memorize the chords derived from the major scale as another tool.

Put it all together and be able to spell any chord.

I would supplement this with practicing sight reading and lots of ear training and transcribing.

I have been playing/writing music on my own for about six years now. (piano is my primary instrument) I understand basic music theory but have never had any formal education. Up until now i have been primarily focused on art and am currently a junior at a prominent art college, but am thinking about a career change. Here are some of my musical efforts in the past: [efforts](http://soundcloud.com/gossamer-itch)

Some of my heroes are:

[Trent Reznor &amp; Atticus Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tTB6HmZNJ5s)

[Philip Glass](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkof3nPK--Y)

[Teddy Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdYe61HSFbQ&amp;playnext=1&amp;list=PL06C03E8285EBE6D5&amp;feature=results_video)

[Clint Mansell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUgC6215Gko)

[Aphex Twin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiVe_4UVhEE)

[Jonny Greenwood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1ij_TEK_MM)

It was first really confirmed in me that this is what I want to do with my life when I watched the film [Koyaanisqatsi](http://www.putlocker.com/file/87BB3A0A28455374) (score by Philip Glass). Put to any other soundtrack those images would evoke a completely different emotion--but Glass' use of tension and dissonance created such a profound feeling of anxiety and unrest it reached into me on a wildly existential level. I am really inspired by the ability to communicate with people through music, and think there is something very unique with film as a medium that amplifies that language. 

**What kind of school I'm looking for**

Firstly let me preface by saying that I have a very limited knowledge of the music industry. From my understanding you can either try and make it as an independent artist, pursue a position in an orchestra, become a music teacher, or become a producer. Otherwise I'm not really sure what sort of career paths are available. So any advice you guys can offer I'll take to heart.

As for what sort of school I am interested in: I am very interested in music theory as well as music production. So something that takes an academic approach as well as teaches you tools for the studio. Atmosphere is a factor too. Preferably somewhere in/near a larger city (I live near Chicago but am open to going anywhere)

Where did you guys receive your education? Do you wish you went somewhere else? Any and all direction you can offer me is greatly appreciated. If you have any questions for me I'd love to hear them. **Thank you**


Also,
If there would be a more appropriate subreddit for this question please let me know :)

I cannot gush enough about the ridiculous awesomeness of this particular song, or the *Dark Side of the Moon* album in general.  However, if came up in [a previous thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/fsmia/is_it_really_worth_it) and in my opinion, this song warrants a music theory discussion all on its own, given that this is r/musictheory and in this song alone there is so much to talk about!  This is my attempt to deconstruct the song, using as little esoteric music theory jargon as possible (you'll see it's impossible to do entirely without - LEARN YOUR THEORY!) and it will no doubt be long and rambling.

Before we begin, references: [Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pbso85eeNo) for the audio and [Ultimate Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/p/pink_floyd/us_and_them_crd.htm) for the chord page.

The question: what makes ""Us and Them"" sound so damn awesome?

The quick and easy answer is the vibe.  The overall slow, steady tempo and the general relaxed atmosphere of the song, especially after coming off the end of Money, really makes this the ""drift into space inside your head while Steve rolls that other blunt"" moment in the album.

The instrumentation, in my opinion, really makes this song work.  The choice of resting the entire song on the shoulders of the Hammond really allows this song to switch from light and spacy to thick and full - to give a literal throttle to the dynamic content of the song - without the stark change of stomping on a footswitch and suddenly you're blaring.  Sorry, Breaking Benjamin fans.

The organ cranks in the choruses with the Leslie and all ten fingers on the keys, but to me it really shines in the verses, where these funky chords that all seem to root on D make for a sparkly, rainbow-colored curtain behind the song.  In this song especially one can see the prism on the cover, with the white entering, the rainbow exiting, and that green line that's totally on the album cover but not on the poster or other paraphernalia.  The fact that Rick Wright plays a different inversion every time really makes for an interesting trip through the song.  The complexity that lies beneath the surface of the keyboards in the song alone is amazing to me.  This song has been one of my favorites since I was old enough to actually understand music (age 13 or so).

The quiet, subdued sax solo in the beginning sets the tone, and I love how it continues to piddle throughout the song without ever really getting in the way.  Even when the sax is clearly the melodic instrument (twice in the song), you can hear everything that's going on behind it.  There is such a proper amount of space in this song that if you're listening for it, everything you could think of scrutinizing can be discerned.

It also helps that this whole album was produced incredibly well, with excellent use of delay and reverb.  It's spacey without being tacky like David Bowie (somehow, it's good when Bowie does it, but when I try caking on the reverb, it sucks.)

The verse melody is simple, easy to sing, stays within a single octave, and has lots of room for breathing (and consequently vocal support).  Oh, and on the second time through the verse pattern, the harmonies at the end really add a unique peak to the end of an otherwise static melody line (""...which is which and who is who?""), preserving the original lyrical matrix (i'll get to that) without being monotonous.

Before I dig into the lyric matrix, I'd also like to touch on dynamics.  It's more than just the soft verse and loud chorus - hell, even Otep knows about that - but it's the little swells and dips within the lines.  The vocal stanzas have a swell to them, the sax lines *definitely* swell and ebb, and even the drums get louder and softer.  The whole song has a slow, rhythmic breathing pattern that actually...will...regulate...your...breathing!  This song is literally calming you down, riling you up just a hair for the chorus, and then setting you back down.  By the time this song abruptly ends and spills into ""Whatever Colour You Like,"" you're almost renewed and ready for the next three songs.  Besides, Steve's had about six minutes to roll that doobie and he normally takes forever.

Now for the real gem of this song, the lyrics.  I won't even discuss the actual subject matter, I'm talking about the vocals themselves, the words, the phonemes and how they interact.

The matrix is as follows:

    One and two.
    And one and two, and shotput one and two.
    Three and four.
    And three and four, and then it's one and two.
    And two.
    
    A and a B, C and a D
    fill some space, and -ide.
    A and a B, C and a D
    Fill some space, and -ide.

All the words plug-and-play into this.  Four times through, beginning with broad language and getting consistently deeper.

Notice also the fact that all of the words chosen are liquid.  Lots of voiced consonants, lots of Rs and Ws and Ls.  Lots of Gs and Ms.  Many words start on fricatives (""...from side to side."")  The only words that end on hard consonants (namely *-p* and *-ck*) are ""black"" and ""up"", both in the same spot in the same verse, both standing alone. *(Edit: forgot about ""sat"" and ""map"" in the first chorus.)  Almost every word ends in a voiced consonant, the words chosen are mostly monophthongs as opposed to diphthongs and have a gentle, rounded quality (at least in the English dialect - sung in a South Carolina accent this song might be a bit harsh).

...and yeah, what about that D minor with the major seventh? (D-F-A-C#) BRILLIANT.  Only Alfred Hitchcock uses that chord. 

What the hell mode is this song in?  I don't know.  D is definitely the tonic, but I wouldn't even give it a mode.  The chorus...B Phrygian (i-VI-II)?  G major (vi-I-V)?

Discuss!

Something I've noticed when people speak is their voice inflection and their relation to musical cadences.  When someone says a sentence you could tell if they have more to say or if they are finished (most of the time).  To me it seems people, while not necessarily in a key, they do seem to speak tonally.  It sounds like people end on a 5th scale degree when they finish their sentence but are about to say more then end on 1 when they are finished.


After noticing this it seems like there are tons of difference cadences of the human voice to imply many many different things.  I'm curious if anyone knows of any other good examples in terms of what scale degree they end on and what emotion they are trying to convey.


I find it almost innate and I very interesting.

Hi!

I'm part of a pilot program to start a website where music students around the nation can log on and speak to a music theory tutor via Skype. I start tutoring on the 17th of October, but there are tutors available 7 days a week until then - just check the calendar on the website for times and names, and on the 'meet the tutors' page you can see a little bit about each one of us. All of us are either in our final year of undergrad or in some stage of graduate education, and we all come with recommendations from some of the leading theory educators in the nation. I hope some of you can make use of this!

Heres that link one more time:

There are six different periods of classical music, Medieval, Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, and Twentieth Century. We are focusing on the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic eras. In today’s blog post, we will explore the music and composers of the Romantic period.

**Romantic Era**

Part of an artistic, literary, and intellectual movement, the Romantic Era began in the late 18th or early 19th century. This new era of music, which arose out of dissatisfaction with former musical formulas and conventions, focused on freedom, passion, movement, and human emotion.

**Sergei Rachmaninoff**

A Russian-born conductor, composer, and pianist, Sergei Rachmaninoff, “the maestro” helped shape romanticism in Russian classical music. Rachmaninoff was truly one of the greatest Romantic Era composers with his rich and distinct orchestra arrangements, structural ingenuity, and melodic lyricism. Rachmaninoff was not only for his compositions; he is today still remembered as one of the most formidable pianists of all time.

“Music is enough for a lifetime, but a lifetime is not enough for music” – *Sergei Rachmaninoff* 

[Piano Concerto No.2 \(First Movement\) – Performed by Arthur Rubinstein](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M_VCbnqbwwA)

Performed by Arthur Rubinstein: Perhaps one of the most famous piano concertos of all time, Piano Concerto No.2 helped establish Rachmaninoff’s fame as a concerto composer. The second and third movements were premiered with Rachmaninoff as the soloist in December of 1900.

[Piano Concerto No.3 \(First Movement\) – Performed by Martha Argerich](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sd8837iPjK8)

Known to be one of the most technically challenging piano concertos in standard classical repertoire, Piano Concerto No.3 was composed by Rachmaninoff in 1909. In this first movement you will hear an initial exchange between the orchestra and the soloist before proceeding into a slow and memorable theme.  The piano concerto was first premiered in November of 1909 with Rachmaninoff again as the soloist.

Essentially, I'm confused as to why people place so much importance on this chord (I've heard it called the starting point of atonality multiple times).  To me, it doesn't seem to be anything too out there... I hear it as a French sixth with an appoggiatura in the upper voice, resolving (albeit with slightly unorthodox voice leading) to V7.  But even if you interpret it slightly differently (I have been told that most analysts view the G#, not the A, as the chord tone) it still seems to me that there are so many more notable examples of unorthodox harmonies that came before this.  I think of Beethoven's Gross Fugue, the finale to Chopin's second piano sonata, and a handful of Liszt works, including his piano sonata and his first Mephisto Waltz (especially the way it opens).

This generally happens when only a single instrument is playing (usually at the beginning of the song). The effect seems heightened when the instruments are the same, or the timbre is at least similar. I'm always quite startled by the effect, because it comes from nowhere with no effort on my part, and there is immediate and total confidence that it's the same pitch as the song I'm familiar with. It feels like the descriptions I've heard from people with perfect pitch: that there's just something about the *pitch* that's just as recognizable as ""normal"" people recognizing what instrument they're hearing. And it's not at all correlated with me hearing the older song very recently, although it seems to happen more often with songs I've heard more times.

But alas, I don't have perfect pitch, sadly, and I can't seem to harness or improve the phenomenon.

Just as an example, here is my most recent experience of the phenomenon. I heard the beginning of the song Run For Your Life by The Fray, and I instantly recognized the brief piano note at the beginning to be the exact same note that begins the song December Boys by Peter Cincotti, which is a song I have heard many times but probably not once in the previous 6 months.

Our first trimonthly competition has started today, and the rules are as follows:

* **Open class** — Any number of traditional western classical instruments; no electroacoustic instruments. 

* **No longer than eight (8) minutes of length.**

* **A score must be provided.** Voters will be encouraged to scrutinize the quality of the score for real world usage.

* **The score and/or the mock-up must be perfectly available for anyone to view and listen to without sign-up, fees etc.**

* **This contest starts July 1. and ends September 30. 2013.** Votes will then be collected for a week, and the winner announced shortly thereafter.

*A new contest starting October 1. through December 31. will commence immediately after the current one.*

These rules won't be subtracted from. They might be altered for clarification. Take note that minor rules might be added at any time. I will notify you when this happens, and it will only happen in the case that this contest might be compromised in any way, that it violates reddit policy etc. Subscribe to /r/composer to be notified.

**How to vote**

There will be a post later about how and when to vote. Subscribe to /r/composer to be notified.

------------

**Prizes**

I'm in the works of recruiting sponsors that may offer a reward to the three top voted contestants. There will be a post about this later. All suggestions are very welcome.

**Feedback**

Do not hesitate to leave your ideas and suggestions in this post, or message the mods directly.

**NB**

The reason a contest have a start (and not just an ending) is that we normally would offer a theme, instrumentation and so on that would be disclosed only at the beginning of each competition period.

Now, a couple years (and defriend-zoning) later, one of our inside jokes is a really simple but annoying jingle she made up that often gets stuck in my head. Given that it's catchy, I decided to try to turn it into a song, if it turns out well, I'll see if I can make that little girl fantasy come true.
Now here's the rub, I just started playing piano last year. I'm not terribly good, but I have a decent grasp of how to use the thing. I also took some classes on music theory a long time ago in school, so I have a passing knowledge of how music works, chords, progressions, keys, reading music, etc.

Now, with that said, I am completely new to composing music from scratch, and though I also have a bit of a poetry background from college, I've never written song lyrics either. So I know there must be some of you out there who are good at this sort of thing, and some of you probably even make your living doing this. What are some common and stupid mistakes I should avoid making? What are some musical blunders that newbies make? Is there anything in particular I can do to make my end product sound more professional and flawless?

I do have an incredibly talented and knowledgeable music teacher who is helping me out, but I don't get to see them very often, so most of the onus is on me. I really need your help, Reddit!

**TL;DR I'm writing a song to propose to my girlfriend, and I need your help! How do I avoid making newbie mistakes?**

**Edit:** So far so good guys, you have been more helpful than I could have imagined.  I will try to get something online later this week for you guys to take a look at.  In the meantime, here`s a very deficient list of the major tips and advice people have mentioned thus far.

* 1 - Keep it simple, keep it simple, and keep it simple
* 2 - Avoid cliches, be sincere, and match the rhythm of your music and lyrics
* 3 - Use few and simple chords and progressions
* 4 - Don`t be a perfectionist, settle with something you can be happy with on your first go rather than giving up out of frustration
* 5 - if it sounds good it is good

**Edit 2:**  I have posted the sketch on Noteflight. So far I have the three sections, two parts of the verse and I guess the chorus. Definitely need to work on the bass, right now it's basically just half-notes on what I'm hoping are the right chords. Also, the first half of the chorus sounded terrible once I added the bass.

Most recognizably, there's the melody of a piece; and when I say ""melody"" here, I'm thinking of both pitches and rhythmic values working together, not just pitches. A melody can undergo quite a lot of variation while still remaining recognizable--hence theme and variation, hence melodic development, and hence cover songs in the popular music world (which can be dramatically different from the original, considered in a note-by-note way).

At first this started asking why the downward chromatic line was written with sharps instead of flats, but we decided that he probably intended to go for the feel of an augmented 2nd instead of a minor 3rd, which is definitely how it sounds harmonically -- does this kind of augmented 5th thing when combined with the left hand. 

But then it got me thinking - I know octatonic scales are popular, but has anyone ever named a scale of alternating minor and augmented 2nds, and if so, are there any other examples of this used in music? I like the idea because it gives that same kind of feel as a double augmented scale... very exotic and non-tonal feeling. I want to experiment more -- can anyone help me come up with ways to utilize this scale, and examples of how it's been done (if it's been done, but I'm sure it has somewhere).

Thanks!

I figure a lot of people here are very musical, regardless of whether they are active performers.
So I have come ask the question, why am I so bad at rhythm? My tonal memory and ability has increased quite a bit, but my ability to notate and read notated rhythm is not improving as well.

My real question is, how do I increase my rhythmic memory as well as my ability to interpret and notate rhythm? I'd love links to resources.

P.S. Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit, but I didn't know where else to go.

Thanks in advance for any help. My question is how to move along the circle of fifths that seems to skip usual harmonic movement, which is especially prevalent in tonal music, when you often switch tonal centers.

I wrote a piece with this harmonic progression:

Fm G Fm G D (tonal center change) F#m G# F#m G#

I'm trying to figure out the chord that should go after G#. I was experimenting with C# but I'm not sure it's the right one. I'm looking for something uplifting to finish the phrase, and transition into the climax, perhaps something in Mixolydian. 

My question is how do you logically or theoretically justify the tonal center switch to F#m, which seems to work in this case. Also, how is it that moving from Fm to G works (and it produces quite a magical effect) when they seem far apart on the Circle of Fifths?

What other tips would you give with tonal center changes using the Circle of Fifths or any other tools? 

Thanks!

For informed readers, you may already know of Riemann's Tonnetz, or more recently, the work of Jerry Balzano, Roger Shepard or maybe Fred Lerdahl.  The theoretical bases are certainly there, and many students of these people are savy with C++ and are creating applications based on their work.  Will the established music industry notice the increasingly diverse array of applications out there?

I guess the real question is whether Yamaha or someone similar will decide to manufacture a hardware platform that is somewhat in competition with the (digital) piano.  Because isomorphic pitch spaces preserve the shape of chords and scales across all keys, there would be no need to learn more than one scale fingering (for instance).  The pedagogical implications could be revolutionary.

It may be that a hardware platform is simply too static, in an age when we want to download everything onto multi-touch devices.

Here is an example of Jerry Balzano's space of major and minor thirds, as an iPad app: [YouTube](http://youtu.be/OGOFBvRgHhw?t=49s).

EDIT: I suppose the Monome could be utilized for these purposes.  However, it is not a (relatively) fixed hardware device like a digital piano is - the sounds are not built in.

EDIT 2: Many people are making a good points about pre-existing string instruments with partial isomorphic spaces (barring the shrinking of intervals as you ascend).  Examples are guitars tuned in all fourths, the bass, and all the upper strings (cello, viola, violin).  Also, accordions.  

EDIT 3: For people who use the Monome or similar controllers: Do you ever use it to control pitch, and how?

EDIT 4: /u/eFFeeMMe/ suggests the following:

I thought I'd begin a thread about those contemporary composers that you feel stand above the rest and will be remembered by Music History as the ""great composers"" of this generation. I know that a lot of this is speculative and won't be known fully until we see the music they complete before their death and the impact their music has on future styles, but it might be fun to do a little bit of speculation.

One composer I definitely think falls into this category is Kaija Saariaho. The most obvious reason for this choice is the fact that she is one of few women composers who have gained such attention and respect in the musical community. Musically, I think her works show a balance of aesthetic concerns for both musical laymen and ""connoisseur."" By this I mean the surface of her works readily draw listeners in with highly interesting moments and clear direction toward musical goals that a wide audience can appreciate and grab onto, but the music also often requires its audience to engage intellectually with deeper structures in order to fully appreciate everything the music has to say.

This ability to balance complexity with approachability, to this observer, makes her a ""great composer""

examples of her music:

[Sept Papillons](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeWpc6mjM4o) for solo cello

[Lichtbogen](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z9y1b91uVuA) for Chamber Ensemble and Electronics

Any thoughts? Disagreements? Other composers that fit this description?

this is all given that the higher string is a perfect 4th (5 frets/half steps) above the lower string. and the person tuning isn't using a guitar tuner.

one of us argues that a person should use the harmonics on the 5th and 7th fret on the lower and higher strings respectively, then adjust until the harmonics match. the other argues that a person should use the 5th fret of the lower string and the open higher string and adjust until the notes match.

one says that using the fret method will bend the strings and create a note that is slightly off and therefore not as good to compare frequency to. the other says that using the harmonic method will make the open strings tuned by just intonation, which is out of common practice, and will be weird because the frets placed for equal temperament.

in all honesty, i know it doesn't matter that much. but you know.... gotta settle it. 

and if anyone has anything else to say about guitar or other string tuning, i'd love to hear it!

EDIT: It seems that this all depends on purpose of intonation. i was inspired to do some calculations myself by using [this chart of A-440 equal temperament tuning](http://www.vaughns-1-pagers.com/music/musical-note-frequencies.htm), and compared the calculations using the twelfth root of two method and those using intervalic ratios. Starting on low E, the former method is 100% accurate using significant figures and disregarding the variables of string bending, string length, and so the 5th fret method is in theory, more accurate.  the latter method, however, only had a 1.2% margin of error, which is considerably small. but considering what many of you said about it being easier to hear the beats using the harmonic method, this seems to be preferred.

TL;DR the 5th fret method is *technically* more accurate in regards to established equal temperament/straight-fret tuning, but the harmonic method is more practical to use.

1325968340.0,25,self.musictheory,o72lf,[Discussion] AotW - Für Elise,FynnClover,28,3,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/o72lf/discussion_aotw_für_elise/,"Heya r/MT! First of all, here's my [analysis](http://imgur.com/a/v6ha7). It's a bit messy but that's what I'll be referencing from. 

Essentially I'll go over the overall form and harmonic progressions and anything interesting I found in the piece. 

Für Elise is in rondo form with the main theme as the A section and two contrasting sections in between. Essentially ABACA. 

**The First A Section:**
The key is in A minor and starts with a minor second motif starting on the E (5th of the scale). In the following measures the chords move back and forth from i and V in an arpeggiated manner. The first big change is after the second ending when it moves to the key of C major, the relative major. It continues the arpeggiations until it transitions back into the minor second motif on E. 

**The B Section:**
This section is where it starts to get interesting. It leads into the B section using three chords in very quick succession III7-VI-III7 in A minor, but this is quickly established to be our new key in F major. The chords, except for the tonic, are all in second inversion, 6/4 which help push the chords along. By the seventh measure of the B section, the piece changes keys again to C using the same motif that was used to originally change the key to F. Brilliant! (It's even further established by the strong I-IV-V chords being repeated over and over.)

**Transition into the Second A Section:**
Just a quick note here that by using all the step wise motion in the right hand, it makes it quite easy to slip back into the minor second motif by throwing in that G#.

**The Second A Section:**
Not much has changed here.

**The C Section:** 
This was the toughie for me. Beethoven has the section be very unstable with the chords in the right hand, but stable in the left with the constant pedal A's. The first chord of the C section is an enharmonically written diminished E7 (because we're still in A minor, vdim7.) Why write it enharmonically? So that C# can lead into the D while the Bb comes down to the A in the next chord. (I forget what this is called and didn't have time to look it up &gt;.&gt;;;) 

When the pedal A moves up a minor second to the Bb in the last measure of page 2, it chromatically modulates to Bb. (It's very apparent in the recordings I've listened to.) However, the piece doesn't stay there long because I feel like it used the Bb to essentially compress the chord further to the G#dim which expands into the A minor chord (I wrote it wrong in my scan...) then the dominant, E major.

**Transition to the Third A Section:**
Just in case the listener forgot what key they were in, Beethoven decided to do a huuuuge arpeggio on A minor reaching into the high E and falling back down, at first in key, but then chromatically until it naturally falls back into the minor second motif. What a way to transition!

**The Final A Section:** 
Nothing new to see here really. :)

All in all Für Elise is a simple piece built on some very interesting ideas used to transition and keep harmonies moving. 

Comment on what you thought about my findings (agree/disagree) and anything else interesting that you find! Let's tear this piece apart. :)

How are these melodies ""driven""? 

In each of these pieces, I feel like they tell a story and they invoke emotions through the creation and resolution of tension and yet whenever I try to write music, it sounds hollow and meaningless, like a bunch of notes that sound good together but have no real *purpose*.

I'm currently involved in an independent study dealing with Spectral Music.  My inquiry into this musical style will use analyses of timbre, texture, and ""harmonicity/inharmonicity"" in order to create a multivalent picture of the music.   I was wondering about current trends in the analysis of timbre (and texture).

The only article I've read on the subject, Stephen Malloch's ""Timbre and Technology: An Analytical Partnership"" (in Contemporary Music Review Vol. 19, 2).  In it, he develops an approach to timbral analysis based on 3 primary parameters: timbral width (how focused the sound is around the loudest 1/3 octave frequency band in the texture at a given moment), sharpness (the frequency position of the loudest 1/3 octave frequency band), and Roughness (acoustic dissonance created by beating between partials).  These three parameters are graphed separately and can be traced throughout entire pieces.

The article was written in 2000, though, and I would be very surprised if Malloch's article is the latest and greatest in timbral analysis, though it is convincing.  Does anyone know any other articles or books on timbral analysis?

Any info on Texture analysis would help too, though I have a dissertation I need to read on that subject (Kari Besharse's ""The Role of Texture in French Spectral Music"")

Mine's E major followed by D minor.

I ask because me and my roommate disagree on whether the key of a song actually makes a difference. He claims that if any famous song was written in a different key (but kept the same Major/minor mode) it would have no impact on it's success. And when we hear a song in a different key it only sounds weird or different because we are used to hearing the original key. I argue that different notes have different **absolute** flavors and not just relative flavors, and certain style songs would sound better in a certain key. For instance I find E maj to be a very driving key, and D minor to be the saddest of the minor keys. Is this just because the E chord is the lowest open string chord on guitar? that's definitely why a lot of punk bands write songs in E major. Is this a chicken or the egg scenario, do I attribute a 'driving' melody to E because it's common in punk or Is it common because its a  more 'driving key'?

Which ever the case may be, I've always been fascinated in what makes people decide what key to write a song in. if there really is no difference why aren't all piano songs in C or Am? It's so much easier to play in those keys on a piano.

Based on a C Using the major scale starting at C4 (middle C) we can determine that: 

1=C4

2 =D4

3=E4

4=F4

The frequency of E4 is 329.628 Hz

The frequency of F4 is 349.228 Hz


We know that 3&lt;pi&lt;4, so E4&lt;frequency of pi&lt;F4

We shall refer to the 'frequency of pi' as 'pi Hz'

if pi = 3 + x, then x=0.1415926535897932384626433832795


Substituting E4 into the equation, we get: pi = E4 + x

We can now switch to measuring in frequencies; we shall use 'x Hz' to represent the frequency value of x


pi Hz = E4 Hz + x Hz
or: Frequency of pi = 329.628 Hz + x Hz


We must now determine the value of x Hz


The value of x when 3&lt;pi&lt;4 will be proportionately equal to the frequency of x when E4&lt; pi Hz &lt;F4


Written as an equation we have: 3&lt;pi&lt;4 = E4&lt;pi Hz&lt;F4
or
3&lt;3+x&lt;4 = 329.628 Hz &lt; 329.628 Hz + x Hz &lt; 349.228 Hz


We can simplify 3&lt;3+x&lt;4 by subtracting 3 from each part of the equation so we get:

0&lt;x&lt;1; or 0&lt;0.1415926535897932384626433832795&lt;1


We can also simplify the Frequencies in the same way:

0 Hz&lt;x Hz&lt;19.6 Hz


Now we have 

0&lt;0.1415926535897932384626433832795&lt;1 = 0 Hz&lt;x Hz&lt;19.6 Hz


We now know that the Frequency of x is in between 0 Hz and 19.6 Hz. We can determine the exact Frequency value of pi using the proportions determined above shown in this equation:


(pi – E4)/(F4-E4) = (x Hz – E4 Hz)/(F4 Hz – E4 Hz)

(pi – 3)/(4-3) = (pi Hz -  329.628 Hz)/(349.228 Hz - 329.628 Hz)

0.1415926535897932384626433832795 = (pi Hz -  329.628 Hz)/(19.6 Hz)

0.1415926535897932384626433832795(19.6 Hz) = pi Hz -  329.628 Hz

2.7752160103599474738678103122782 Hz = pi Hz - 329.628 Hz

332.10321601035994747386781031228 Hz = pi Hz


The frequency value of pi in a C4 Major scale is 332.10321601035994747386781031228 Hz

This occurs on the third and forth measures of page 4.


Here's a recording:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=RR7eUSFsn28#t=233s

The third measure on page four, beats 3 and 4 contain a iv chord, with the Cb. Now normally in a iv chord, the third of the iv chord (Cb) resolves down to the fifth of the I chord (Bb). However, you'll notice that Chopin does not write the Bb along with the G in the fourth measure on page four. 

He does this because the left hand harmony uses the Bb, and they can't overlap, I suppose. However, to make up for it, he adds an accent on the Bb to show how the Cb has resolved down. 

I thought that was rather interesting; before, to me, it seemed like he put a random accent in there. But I suppose there was rhyme and reason to his actions after all. It's a different way to do voice leading I guess.

As a pianist without a whole lot of background in music theory, I often wondered how composers achieve certain effects in their music.

In the case of Rachmaninoff, I have always been fascinated with his ability to achieve these awesome emotional climaxes (if ""climax"" is the right term) in his music. This is especially prevalent in his Third Piano Concerto.

Here are a few examples of what I'm talking about. In this section of the 2nd movement, there are [two climaxes](http://imgur.com/SRX8kiL) in close succession. This occurs again [here](http://imgur.com/z8HWqSH) and [here](http://imgur.com/AoQuEt2) during the exposition of the 3rd movement's lyric theme (and also several times throughout the ensuing middle section, which I believe is in ""theme and variations"" form).

Could someone possibly explain this technique Rachmaninoff employs in his music? Please feel free to comment on or analyze the examples provided. I am really interested in employing this style in my own ""dabblings"" in composition.

Thanks in advance!

First things first, this isn't a homework assignment :). Just personal interest.

So this song is pretty crazy. I'm trying to make some sense of it harmonically, but it's pretty difficult.

So the main theme. The piece started out with the Dmaj right hand ostinato with the 1 7 6 b6 octaves in the bass which leaves us with a I, I42, vi7, then a weird.. bvi7 chord which stacks up as a Bb D F# and A. So that's a major third major third minor third making a weird sort of augmented major minor 7 chord? I'm probably thinking about this totally wrong.. but that's what I can gather thus far. 

Then come the lyrics ""to the daily mail... together, together"" which goes  I, bVII, vi I guess?

Then surrounding the lyrics ""you made a pigs ear you made a mistake it has this crazy cool modulation thing thing. The piano plays an arpeggiated C major triad with an Eb on on top then an arpeggiated Db major with the Eb still being played until it arrives at a Eb major triad. It repeats this a few times and I honestly can't make any sense of what's happening. Is it just some fancy mode mixture or a modulation? My friend says he's tonicizing the neapolitan, which I guess makes some sense but I have no idea how that's happening. Could anyone shed some light on this please? Is the Eb acting as some sort of weird pedal tone dragging us towards the new tonic? I have no idea! Woo.

Here is one of my favorite piece's by him: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYdRzDx1_J4

Harvey was of a school of composers emerging in the 70s called ""spectral"" composers, meaning that rather then using abstract collections of pitches as the basis of their compositions, they used the acoustical properties of sound itself.  These composers use such techniques as ""resynthesis,"" wherein a computer generated sonogram is recreated using live instruments and using processes similar to ""ring modulation,"" ie, multiplying two frequencies together in order to produce pitch material for the piece.

Really fascinating stuff, I actually plan on delving into the subject for my next independent study.  There are two issues of the Contemporary Music Review (Nos. 2 and 3 for the year 2000), that deal exclusively with the subject, and I'm wondering if anyone else has any other sources on this type of music that would be useful to look at when researching.

[Asian_bloke](http://www.reddit.com/user/Asian_bloke) assured me it's fairly easy.

Yet I wanted to hear some broader discussion, about pianists' limits and taking them into account when composing music. I know it's hard to talk in general, because there is always someone better, but we have to draw a line somewhere. I don't even know how to properly and professionally describe good pianist (to distinct them from above average ones, yet doesn't necessarily require superb skills and extraordinary spirit seen in the best ones, like Gould, Kissin, Lisitsa) and how many years of experience it requires at least (as I never was playing on the piano). I guess I'll accept whatever pros here will conclude in that matter.

So... are there any known and acknowledged limits of the good pianists that composers should take into account? Like staccato on 32nd note cannot go beyond 160 bpm or something alike? How better great pianists can do? Are there resources covering such topics? Not every composer is a good pianist before, so I think such information could be helpful at least for some composers out there.

**&lt;EDIT&gt;**: If possible please provide some examples of the limits, not only as the existing tracks but rather as musical notations and solutions that can be seen sometimes, yet should be avoided, because they are too hard to play. **&lt;/EDIT&gt;**

(I am aware that nowadays we don't _necessarily_ require pianists to play music, but piano recordings w/o human touch are IMO still spirit-less.)

For the longest time I had been battling myself in my own head, trying to understand exactly how our system of music evolved the way it did, especially in regard to the note nomenclature. It struck me as arbitrary, the way that the notes are named according to the diatonic gamut, and then the chromatic notes are seen as ""in between"" them, even though all twelve notes are equally spaced apart, in terms of cents (at least in 12TET).

Then somebody suggested to me that, rather than diatonicism being a result of chromaticism, it was the other way around. That the diatonic notes came FIRST, and then a tuning system was built around that. Can anybody verify this? Even better, can somebody point me to a book or a website that explains this, in thorough detail?

I want to know WHY the diatonic gamut sounds to us the way it does. I want to know WHY there are two semitones, two and three whole tones apart respectively, and WHY it's so damn universal.

This was underlying point of starting this thread. I don't know the rules. I have to rely on books given my particular circumstances and the two I have tried so far have so many errors or are just badly edited/badly written.

1366359472.0,20,self.musictheory,1co37h,Tips for music theory edits of Wikipedia by knowledgeable music theorists.,robertinventor,21,1,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1co37h/tips_for_music_theory_edits_of_wikipedia_by/,"Hi, just seen the discussion about difficulties knowledgeable editors have editing the music theory section of wikipedia.

Anyway - might be interesting to share my own experiences and things I've found useful. My particular area of interest is microtonal music, as a developer of microtonal software, and rhythms (especially polyrhythms) and the metronome as developer of a metronome with polyrhythmic capabilities.

Mainly I do minor edits or at most add a new section or sections to an existing article. I have contributed one music theory article, this one on the hexany, a little known area of microtonal music theory which I happen to have some knowledge about through my microtonal connections.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexany

I have had my share of reversions and deletions - and the hexany article itself was nominated for deletion originally - but have worked through them, and recently almost none of my edits get reversed or deleted, so I feel I've figured out how to do these things now :).

So anyway what I've found helps is - first of all - that if you have loads of citations in new material - to well established scholarly articles - then only the most knowledgeable of editors will question it and no-one will do an instant revert of what you wrote. The editors knowledgeable enough to question what you wrote will be very likely to have something interesting and useful to say about it too.

For music theory, you can almost always find an article or two on google scholar that says exactly what you want. Even if it is something that ""everyone knows"" in your field, still, if you can back it up with a citation, it is well worth doing.

That's the main difference between contributing to wikipedia and writing an academic paper or thesis. In an academic paper  you only need to back up the more recondite things with a citation. On wikipedia you need to add citations even for many things that most in your field regard as obvious.

So - well for things that are obvious to everyone in your field - they are not likely to be the actual point of the academic article. But that doesn't matter, still you'll almost certainly find many articles that say the thing that you want to have backed up, e.g. in the background or introduction or similar section or just as an aside. So just find one of those, or a couple of them, and add them as a citation to the article and the chances are high your edit will never be reverted.

The reason is - on wikipedia - no-one knows your credentials. So you can't use your authority as a basis for saying things. That's both a weakness and a strength of the way it works. 

So - if you just edit an article to change something that is mistaken, if you don't do a citation or otherwise explain yourself, your edit is indistinguishable to less knowledgeable and less specialist wikipedians from an edit by someone who knows nothing about the subject, and is just putting forward an individual eccentric ""original research"" idea.

Once they realise that it really is a genuine, citation backed, knowledgeable edit then it is highly unlikely to be reverted in an area like music theory (that's more likey to happen in the more controversial areas like politics or history or biography).

Sometimes though as some of you said, it's not enough to just use citations for new material. Sometimes the article is plainly wrong, or it is a matter of debate where it puts just one point of view and there is a whole different point of view that isn't even mentioned which might even be the majority view on the subject.

Also it might sometimes be hard to find citations for something that everyone in the field regards as obvious.

In that sort of situation, it can help a lot to first post to the talk page. Explain your view in detail on the talk page, maybe even add a paragraph showing what the text will look like after your suggested edit. With citations too ideally. But the great thing is on the talk page your edit won't be reverted or removed, so long as it is on topic. It will just be commented on (hopefully). So you can say whatever you like. 

Then, whatever the outcome, what you say remains on the talk page for a long time for others to read (at least until the talk page gets so long it gets archived, and for minor articles then it stays indefinitely).

So - just by mentioning it on the talk page you already help some readers (I often go to look at the talk page of articles to learn more and find out if there were alternative views not mentioned in the main article).

Then - you might well get no replies to your suggestion. If so, wait a few days to give time for any established wikipedian watching that page to respond (in case they are off-line). Then if no-one replies, then go ahead and just do your edit.

If you do that - then it is highly unlikely that your edit will be reverted. While exactly the same edit done without a mention on the talk page first is quite likely to be reverted.

If you do get a reply on the talk page then you can engage in discussion. I've engaged in one or two like that. Can be quite long but with patience you can usually work through it to a mutually amicable solution that is also accurate. Any criticism or misunderstanding gives you an opportunity to express your intended edit more clearly, and to find more citations to help back it up. Sometimes it can lead to clarification of misunderstandings you had yourself too, e.g. if the other party in the discussion is a specialist who is knowledgable about some aspect of the issue you haven't researched into yourself.

In my experience that approach works very well indeed.

Also - it takes patience and it takes time. A few years ago many areas of Wikipedia were extremely low quality. Now many of the same areas are high quality.

You are unlikely to be able to fix all the issues instantly. But if each knowledgeable editor works on a few small areas of interest to them and where they are highly knowledgeable - or fixing obvious mistakes where a citation or a pre-mention on the talk page can back it up easily - then over months and years the issues will eventually get sorted out.

I haven't come across any particular editor that was an issue in my particular area of microtonal music and complex rhythms and the metronome. But if that does happen - well enough citations, enough discussions where others weigh in on the talk page to back up what you say - and eventually they will be won around - or else - others will come in to support your side of the arguments.

Also - just to make clear in case I gave the wrong impression, I'm not a music scholar myself. I'm a mathematician with a specialist interest in some particular topics in microtonal music and polyrhythms. In those special areas I'd say I'm a knowledgeable amateur :). 

But the same issues apply for knowledgeable amateurs with specialist knowledge in a small area of the subject, and for music scholars - except mainly for breadth of knowledge and background, which is why I feel my comments may help here.",,False,,t5_2qrjj,1366363681.0,,,True,t3_1co37h,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/1co37h/tips_for_music_theory_edits_of_wikipedia_by/,

That link just has a few tracks I think are decent. ""Sungate"" was mostly composed by a [friend](http://soundcloud.com/brianly) (the first 20-30 seconds) and left to me to try and continue as an exercise.

I've been playing the piano for about 14 years, but I've never been challenged by my teachers to apply theory to my practice/learning process.

So when it comes down to it, how do I improve? Do I focus on theory? Do I just keep spitting stuff out while trying to emulate/understand what modern film composers are doing?

Should I take a break from composing at all, and just do some hardcore score reading? (Will learning from classical music actually help me with this kind of music? I somehow get the feeling it will, but I feel like it might not be the fastest way.... unless I somehow got copies of scores or project files to a ton of very modern pieces.)

I want to learn theory anyway, if it'll help me learn pieces for the piano faster/more effectively, but I have no idea where to start.

Am I mistaken, or is the author of this music mistaken?

I'm not sure what it is; maybe all the new terms make it overwhelming but when I start reading anything basic about scales and chords, tones, semi-tones, intervals, triads, sevenths, all that stuff, it's just too much and I can't make sense of it. Nothing I read ever connects to anything in reality, it just all seems so abstract and difficult, and I just give up.  

As an example, here's a basic explanation of the major scale from my guitar book:

*""The intervals on any scale occur between individual notes. The series of tone and semitone steps on the major scale are termed major and minor seconds. For example, C to D is a tone or a major second and E to F is a semitone or minor second. Larger steps between notes of the major scale also have an interval name to identify the number of scale notes and the size of the space between them. For example, C to E is a major third and C to F is a perfect fourth.""*

What does it mean major and minor seconds? What is the difference between the two? What does that have to do with major &amp; minor chords? What does ""perfect"" fourth mean? Why is C to F a fourth?

I am reading an article by Joshua Fineberg entitled ""Guide to the Basic Concepts and Techniques of Spectral Music.""

Eventually, this produces negative frequencies, which Fineberg then says ""negative frequencies are heard identically to positive ones, except that the phase is inverted.""

Is this true?  It seems a bit dubious to me, but then again I have absolutely zero knowledge of how sound waves work.

Should I then click ""invert"" under effects? or will that make a difference?

I'm a semi-pro arranger of music, and a lot of the time I'll also arrange popular music in my spare time to let the local high schools play during their pop concerts and such. Since I arranged these pieces in my free time and they weren't commissioned, I don't feel bad about giving them out for free. That in turn made me wonder if I could maybe give them to people who would appreciate them on the internet, and from there, wondered how many other people had similar arrangements that they'd want to share.

I went ahead and preemptively registered /r/ArrangeMusic so no one can coup me out of it. Now, assuming the interest is there (and not just from people who want free music, I'm not sure how many other people would be able and willing to provide content), I still have a few questions that I'd like to get answered about the endeavor:

1. Is it legal? The arrangements would all obviously be free for anyone to print, and presumably perform. Would anyone get in trouble? What for? 

2. Does anyone else just arrange music in their free time, or for whatever reason have orchestrations (orchestration class arrangements, pet projects, etc)? I used to put hours into arranging video game music for this ensemble I put together, and I know that I'd be doing arrangements anyway, but I really would like to make sure it doesn't end up that I'm doing over 75% of the submissions, despite the fact I only submit something once a week or so. I know there are a lot of gifted musicians on this subreddit, I'm just curious how many would be interested, especially since I'm pretty weak at arranging for voice. I'm also sort of afraid that we'll get 10 or so submissions right off the bat, but then have the number of posts flatline after a week or so.

3. What sort of sites would be good for file hosting? I was imagining each submission would optimally lead to an external file hosting site's page, from which a .zip (or other archive file) could be downloaded, and .pdfs extracted and printed. What site would be optimal to those ends? 

4. Do people want free sheet music? I put a rule in that you can't post requests for arrangements because I was afraid that it would end up being just a plethora of requests for arrangements. At the same time, though, just having people post whatever arrangements they happen to have is sort of like just waiting for it to rain. As someone who was looking for free sheet music, not only would I want music that I wanted to perform, but it would also have to be music that I had the proper ensemble for. What would the chances be that someone would happen to submit an arrangement that you could not only use, but wasn't some niche piece that your ensemble couldn't really appreciate? Also, most of the arrangements I have are for string orchestra or concert band. What are the chances that someone who selects repertoire for large ensembles like that would subscribe, then actually have something they could and wanted to perform? In short, would this actually be useful?

Anyway, I am much obliged for your time reading this and responding.

Today, I found some interesting uses for them in the Super Mario World ending theme: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNcIAC30mWI  I'm going to just spell out the chords in C major because, well, this is what I'm asking!  Each chord is basically a measure, but I'm grouping them in 2-bar phrases.

Dm9 Gaug | C Baug | Gm/Bb A7 | F F#dim C/G A7 | Dm7 G7 | C Baug | Gm/Bb A7 | F F# C/G A7 | Dm7 G7 C

Now, for the first part of the theme (C B+ Gm/Bb A7) the bass is played on beat 1 and the G below is played on beat 3 for C, B+, and Gm/Bb, the E on the A7.  I don't consider this to be the bass despite being below.  Whatever.  So here's my question: how do I analyze that?  I feel that the B+ chord is a B chord and not a G chord, despite it being equivalent to G+ -- the B is simply not heard as a leading tone, and the A in the melody is more like a B+7 than a G+9 chord; it's actually reinterpreted as the 9th of Gm the next bar.  So I'd do it this way:

ii9 V+ | I V+/iii(?) | iv6/ii V7/ii | IV CTo (common-tone diminished) I64 V7/ii | ii7 V7 | I V+/iii | iv6/ii V7/ii | IV CTo I64 V7/ii | ii7 V7 I

First, I'm not sure how to properly write a common-tone diminished chord -- this was never covered in my music theory classes.  I suppose it could be a viio/V, resolving pretty regularly into a I64, considering that the I64 can be heard as a kind of V chord.  Second, is the I64 a passing 64?  Most importantly, am I analyzing the I V+/iii iv6/ii V7/ii correctly?  I feel like the Baug to Gm/Bb is a very smooth chord progression, but V+/iii to iv6/ii doesn't make that clear at all.  The four chords have the feel of a sequence, and I can easily see why if I spell them out:

C E G, B D# G, Bb D G, A C# G

The G stays, while the major third below it moves down a half step in each chord.  The voice leading is very smooth here.  This is pretty clever on the part of Koji Kondo, I think.  But the piece still sounds perfectly tonal, so what is the actual function of all those chords?

EDIT: I'm rethinking the B+.  I'm now thinking that it's a B7b13 (given the A in the melody), which would make it a V7b13/iii rather than a V+/iii.  It still doesn't make so much sense, though, since there's no iii to resolve to, unless the iii is actually a iiiø43 with no root, and I think we can all agree that's a ridiculous proposition.",,False,,t5_2qrjj,1345957624.0,,,True,t3_yu5g8,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/yu5g8/help_with_some_mario_tonal_analysis_also/,

They are the tritones found in the dominant chords leading to the root chord and the root chord of the relative minor. 

For example, in the key of A, the first available tritone is G# to D, the tritone found in E7.
The second is F to B, the tritone found in C#7 (dominant chord to F#, the relative minor).

G#, D, F, and B are the notes found form a diminished chord, with any of those 4 roots.


There are three sets of tritones/dim chords: C family tritones, C# family tritones, D family tritones.


E, C family
F, C# family
F#, D family
G, C family
G#, C# family
A, D Family
Bb, C family
B, C# Family
C, D family
C#, C Family
D, C# Family
Eb, D family

Thus the diminished chord of the key can start on either the major 2nd, 4th, minor 6th, or major 7th of any key. 

Also, you can break the keys themselves into families. The keys starting from the notes in the C family tritones (keys C, Eb, F#, and A, notably consecutive sets of relative minors) all can use the D family tritones. The keys starting from the C# family (C#, E, G, Bb) all have the C family, and the keys starting from the D family (D, F, G#, B) all have the C# family.

The dim chord consists for example in C minor, of the notes C, Eb, Gb and Bbb

The function of this chord, as I've read in various books and on wikipedia, is mostly that of a secondary dominant, and I can definitely hear that, but I don't really understand why?

Also, when I try to solo on this chord (in a functional, tonal context) I encounter a few problems.. I've tried the C diminished scale but that doesn't really work, and neither does the C melodic minor scale.. why doesn't it work and what are the scales mostly played on this chord..?

In any case, we mostly use equal-temperament now. Any scientific case for the difference between keys seems to have vanished when we decided to equalize the distance between each note. (Perhaps there was a real difference between keys in the days of well-temperament)

It makes sense to me that people subconsciously associate keys with their past experience - thus giving it a different feel. I HAVE felt this strongly with a couple of keys. 

ALSO: a friend of mine suggested that the instrumental range in a key makes a much bigger difference. Think of when you hear minutia of strain in a singer's voice or a violin. In this sense the key becomes very important.

I am trying to review theory for a college audition and had a question I would like some help with.

I mainly play I-IV-V progressions and use the minor pentatonic scale.

Two Questions:

1. Can I play the A minor pentatonic over both Am-Dm-Em and A-D-E? Or do I need to play the minor penatonic on the Am and the major penatonic on the A major? The reason I ask is because I think BB king is playing a minor I-IV-V but utilizing both the minor and major penatonic.




2. If I'm playing Am-Dm-Em 12 bar blues I know I can run up and down the whole neck using the minor penatonic boxes and starting with the first one on the 5th fret. I know I can play the first box of the Am penatonic over the Am chord. But can I switch the key of the penatonic scale along with the chord changes? For example

(A bars)
Play the first box of the minor penatonic scale starting on the 5th fret, which would be the key of A.

(D bars)
Play the first box of the minor penatonic scale starting on the 10th fret, which would be the key of D

(E Bars)
Play the first box of the minor pentatonic scale starting on the 12th fret, which would be the key of E

Does that work? Or should I just use the notes in the A minor pentatonic and run the boxes up and down the fret board.

Please help!,Freddicus,21,3,24,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/17xrgk/confused_about_instrument_keys_please_help/,"Hello! I consider myself an intermediately skilled musician (29/m/hobbyist). I play a few instruments pretty well - not great, but well enough: alto sax, bari sax, guitar, and euphonium (treble clef - high school). I've recently become confused about something that is a very basic concept. First, I'll explain what I do understand.

The Eb alto sax means that the entire instrument is transposed. So when we play a Bb major concert scale (2 flats), I actually play a G major scale (1 sharp) on my alto. My C major scale on my alto is actually a concert Eb major scale (three flats). I get it.

When I played the treble clef euphonium parts in high school, I learned that the euphonium is a Bb instrument. So when I played my C major scale, it was the concert Bb major scale (2 flats). This is similar to the trumpet, another Bb treble clef instrument. The fingerings are even the same.

***Now for the part I am totally confused on...***

I'm gearing up to learn the tuba. I'm going to have to get good at reading bass clef, I know, but there's something I don't understand. Why is it that the Bb tuba is seemingly now a concert pitch instrument? Suddenly what I learn the fingering for C on the euphonium - also a Bb instrument - is now just Bb. If I wanted to play the euphonium in bass clef it would have meant the same thing.

Why does the transposition ""go away"" in bass clef? I'm more than a little confused and would love some clarification. Especially since I know there are also C tubas, Eb tubas, and F tubas. What's the difference if there is no transposition? I would love some insight here.

Thanks!

For another example, take an ascending minor sixth F Db.  My mind can hear it in two ways, even without the context of a dominant chord as in the previous example.  I can hear it as if it were in a Db chord, a major ""tinge"", or more of a F minor thing, or less likely, Bb minor.

Obviously, these rules can be, and in many cases are useful analytical tools, or vocational tools (if you're writing jingles and/or film music). But it seems pointless to focus so intently on an analytical (as opposed to generative) method aimed primarily at the old styles, and which mostly fall apart when getting into even 20th century music, let alone this century's music. 

I have always been told, ""You must know the rules to break them,"" but in this example (Debussy preludes book 2 number 10) it seems that the composer is not tip toeing around some rules, he's just writing progressions that mess with the functions of chords.

In case you don't know guitar tabs or want to read them, the chords used during the verses and solo are Bm and E5, and E.  There is a lead guitar that plays the notes: F#, E, and D during the verse and during the solo plays the notes A, B, C#, D, E, F#, G# (occasionally bending the E to an F to give it kind of a 'strained' sound, I guess).

During the chorus, the guitar plays the chords Bm, F#m, G, and A (although they are all no. 5 chords - missing the middle minor/major 3rd) and the bass and lead guitar play notes that are all in the key of D major/B minor.

So, according to this I would say that the song is in the key of A major/F# minor during the verses and solo but switches to D major/B minor during the chorus.  But most of the sources I've found, like [this](http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdFPE.asp?ppn=MN0059937), say the song is just in the key of B minor.

That fits with the chorus, but how do you explain the notes used in the solo that are not in the key of B minor?  If the song is in both B minor and A major/F# minor, why do sources not say it's in both keys, or just F# minor for that matter?  Also, how do you classify this song as either B minor or D major?

So I decided to pull out the score and give it a listen.

There is a completely awesome thing that I'm pretty sure is a deceptive cadence at bar 161. Here's the score: [http://imslp.org/wiki/String_Quartets,_Op.33_%28Haydn,_Joseph%29](http://imslp.org/wiki/String_Quartets,_Op.33_%28Haydn,_Joseph%29)

We're in C major, and the progression starting from a few bars previous goes from I 6/4 to V7 to what I believe is vii°/V before returning to I 6/4 into the end of the movement. It's the vii°/V that I'm curious about. The move is from G F B D to A F# C C.

I've always understood a deceptive cadence to be a move from dominant to vi or IV 6, and usually with 1 doubled. The question, I guess, is ""is this an altered IV chord, or is this the vii°/V tonicizing the I 6/4 that follows it, and is there a name for whatever it is?""

i personally love the harmonies you can create with these modes, and how easy it makes the understanding of a lot of the chords you find in modern music (especially jazz). they don't sound nearly as diatonic as modes of the major scale... which has been played well past the point of death :)

—


Modes of ascending melodic minor scale, with aural example:

i:  melodic minor

ii:  phyrgian with a natural 13

III:  augmented lydian (a lydian chord with a raised 5th)

IV:  7#11, i.e. dominant lydian

V:  7 b13 (an altered dominant; however the mode starting on the 7th degree sounds way better for an altered dominant chord)

viø:  half diminished (m7b5)

VII:  altered dominant (b9, #9, #11, b13).  sometimes called super-locrian. 

—

as an example, try playing a G min-maj9 chord on the piano:

G  Bb  D  F# A

in midrange, while holding the sustain pedal down. then play octaves in the bass on each note of the G melodic minor scale, and listen to the harmonies you get.  the 5th degree isn't used that much, so you could skip ""D"".  

a nicer / more pragmatic voicing:

Bb E F# A D

try this one, and again, play octaves in the bass, starting with G and going up the notes of the G melodic minor scale.  it's quite beautiful!

(this latter voicing can be seen as a the 7th/3rd or 3rd/7th of a C dominant or F# dominant chord, respectively; with an upper triad of D major, i.e. the II in C or the bVI in F# - notice how C and F# are the 2 dominant chords in G melodic minor modal harmony, as they are the IV and the VII scale degrees).",,False,,t5_2qrjj,1339696659.0,,,True,t3_v1xb6,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/v1xb6/harmonies_derived_from_modes_of_the_melodic_minor/,

However, I don't have developed perfect pitch (whether I have the potential is debatable).  

Ever since hearing the music in this video, and then hearing the composer briefly mention in a making-of video that the music starts out with 4 octaves of E, I have been able to recall an E without any reference with very high accuracy.  I'd say I'm right about 95% of the time or more.  To me, E is associated in my mind with an abstract image that could best be described as thin, pale yellow, and vaguely containing master chief. E is also very eerie.  Perhaps this influenced by the content of the trailer.

I can't do that with any other note, though I haven't really tried, and honestly I don't know how I would go about trying.  This happened entirely by accident.

Of course I have a general idea of how to implement theory to my music writing, but I'm sure someone with more experience would be able to help guide me in the right direction more adequately.

It's a theory developed in the 50's by the late, great George Russell. Many a great have studied it, namely Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk, Ornette Coleman...and others...

anyone here practice and apply Russell's ideas? I've only acquired the text maybe six months ago and undoubtedly studying it has transformed my playing. It'd be great if there's anyone on here to bounce ideas with. If you've never heard of this theory, as I think most have not, check these out if you're interested. Some basic explanations and Russell's web site.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFYYSq7f6Y8

http://lydianchromaticconcept.com/

one of the core observations underlying the theory is that, if you were to stack seven consecutive fifths...(say C, G, D, A, E, B, F#), a beautiful sound, and place these notes in alphabetical order, the Lydian scale is what is formed. Now, if, for instance, one were chilling with the general tonal daddy of the Ionian, the major scale, the stacked fifths, starting from C, would be C, G, D, A, E, B, F...not F #....this one tone creates a huge difference. Russell's observation that the stacking of 7 consecutive fifth creates a totally resolved state of tonality, and that, if the notes are placed in alphabetical order, the Lydian Scales emergres, brought him to surmise that, in fact, the LYDIAN scale is more of a tonally centered scale from which to base one's harmonic outlook than the major scale. This is a somewhat rudimentary explanation, but I think it covers the bases. Any more versed theorists out there, please elucidate.

Anyway, this is a beautiful mapping of music, opening up uncharted territories and understandings of tonal reality. I do suggest ye check it out. Paz",,False,,t5_2qrjj,False,,,True,t3_eaeww,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/eaeww/lydian_chromatic_concept_of_tonal_organization/,

It's very interesting to me that the circle of 4ths descends, while the circle of 5ths ascends.  I think the reason why it does this is because a 4th plus a 4th is a sevenths, less than an octave, while a 5th plus a 5th is a 9th, greater than an octave.

My friend and I (both grad students in composition) had an interesting discussion on the terminology still used to name the aesthetics from the ""impressionists"" to the ""spectralists"" (Murail, Grisey, etc.) and even the minimalists.

It all began because I read a document which named the music from Debussy and Ravel ""renouvellement"" --- renewal music. Which I thought was interesting since they might not be impressionists in the first place. I thought it would be good temporary term which could include other composer from 1889 to 1945 (Schoenberg, Webern, Ives, Stravinsky, etc.) since they all had one thing in common: they contributed to the dislocation of the tonal system (I used a litteral translation from the French, sorry if you use another term).

My friend, on the other hand, seemed to be okay the term impressionists, even if the composers aren't really impressionists. Since it became a common and accepted terminology, and we know what we are talking about when we use this term.

This document was a program note from the Ensemble Intercontemporain from IRCAM.

So, what are your thoughts?

Is renewal music an acceptable term which would take in count enough of the composers from that era?
If not, what could be?


Do you have any problems with other terminology such as modern, postmodern, contemporary? Since they technically can not be fixed in time. (I do)

Why is modernist (visual) art so well received by people, but modernist music not well received when they shared similar aesthetic and philosophical principles?  

Pablo Picasso is arguably one of the most famous artists of all time.  Everyone knows what cubism looks like, and most people can at least name one Picasso painting.  What I don't understand is that Picasso's art is really weird, sometimes grotesque and strangely sexual, but it's still well liked and accepted.

Salvador Dali is another modernist that is a common household name.  People love those melting clocks, even though they're super weird.  Dali was also no stranger to grotesque, controversial or sexual content (see [Hitler Masturbating](http://www.wikipaintings.org/en/salvador-dali/hitler-masturbating).)

So my question is, why are these artists so popular and well known while musical modernists from the same era, such as Arnold Schoenberg and Anton Webern completely unknown to most people, and why do most people have a negative reaction to modernist music when first hearing it?

I'm currently reading Richard Cohn's Audacious Euphony: Chromaticism and the Triad's Second Nature.  There are a couple of passages that he devotes to defending some of his positions from potential (or actual) objections that could be raised.  Some of these objections seem obvious and, as a result, it is obvious why Cohn would respond to them.  One in particular stands out to me though, precisely because it isn't immediately apparent why it would be problematic, the objection that his system is inherently ""dualist"" in nature.  

For anyone with this book, he addresses this objection in chapter 2 under the section ""Remarks on Dualism"" (pp. 37- 39 in my copy).  

Dualism, as Cohn defines it is ""the notion that major and minor triads are generated by equal but opposite metaphysical or physical forces. Such a commitment would be embarrassing on a priori grounds, since the metaphysics is obsolete and the physics apocryphal."" (32) He notes that Tymoczko objects that ""the system of triadic transformations is 'fundamentally dualist' and hence ripe for wholesale rejection.  It is hardly necessary to explain why attributions of dualism are a priori problematic, since the term is identified with the discredited harmonic dualism of Oettingen and Riemann under which the triadic transformations were initially conceived."" (37)

A couple of questions stem from this.  

1) what is the harmonic dualism that Oettingen and Riemann proposed, and why is it discredited?  

2) Why is dualism itself, not just the specific type of dualism proposed by Oettingen and Riemann, grounds for wholesale dismissal of a system?  What use is there in saying ""dualism is at work, therefore it is wrong"" if it is formulated in an independent manner?  Shouldn't that dualism be judged on its own merits and premises rather than rejected outright? 

I ask these because as a reader, it would be nice to understand the context surrounding Cohn's arguments, if only to evaluate whether he adequately defends his positions against them.  His response that consonant triads are related not based on harmonic dualism, but rather on melodic dualism and their inherent connection through minimal voice leading makes sense to me... but if he doesn't explain why harmonic dualism is discredited, I can't reasonably conclude that his arguments are sufficient to distance himself from harmonic dualism.

I love cyballius. Anyway, it's a big job opportunity for music theorists. 
I'd suggest the following rates:

* real fugal esposition......................................$70
* tonal fugal exposition....................................$120
* whole fugue..................................................$180
* - with stretto................................................$200
* -with counterexposition.................................$230
* double fugue................................................$260
* -with one subject in augmentation..................$280
* -combined with other subject in diminution.......$300

Next time with sonata forms.

**edit** so last line i'm thinking about switching the F7 and the E7b9  
so /A-maj7/Bb7/E7b9,F7#9/A- so it leads a little stronger.  
i was also thinking about changing the 2 last lines into  
/C6/F7/A-maj7/A-maj7/  
/E7b9/F7#9/A-/A-/  
just to make the leading tones in the last line more present. which do you guys like better?

last semester, I took a course on 18th-century counterpoint (using Gauldin's textbook).  I was looking to do some more score study involving basic 4-part harmonization, and what better composer to study for this then Bach?

As a result, I was wondering if anyone knew of any printed editions of all the Bach 4-part Chorales.  This is the standalone sets BWV 250-438 as well as, preferably, the chorale movements from the larger works such as the cantatas or the passions.  I looked on sheetmusicplus (hoping for a Baerenreiter edition) but Baerenreiter only had the cantatas and ""organ works"" which isn't what I'm looking for.   So does anyone own or know of a complete edition of all the chorales?  Even if its only the BWV 250-438 stand-alone ones?

Anyway, I know this isn't strictly theory based, so if I need to delete it, then fine, but it is related to a theoretical pursuit (4-part counterpoint study), so maybe it works.

Help us settle this time signature debate.,MJKauz,19,4,60,http://www.reddit.com/r/musictheory/comments/15k9ug/its_an_ongoing_discussion_i_have_with_my_musician/,"I never went to school for music. I played a number of instruments in high school, but primarily was a woodwind player. That being said, my mind is all about beats. I can visualize what drummers play, but my technical ability was never close.

With that in mind I tend to dive deep into a musician or song and try to pull apart their music. Dave Matthews Band, for all the discredit they get for having frat-boy pot-head fans, has some amazing musicianship, in my opinion. I was going through the anthology when I rediscovered the song ""American Baby (Intro)."" Its interesting to me for a couple reasons, but mostly the time signature.

I have a few friends that went to school for music and got their degrees, unlike myself, and we debate this off and on. I'd like you to listen to this song and try to decide for yourself the time signature.

[""American Baby (Intro)""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFnA-lbDsJ8)

My answer to the question is quite simple. The music majors like to make it complicated. Looking at it from a drumming perspective it makes sense to me that the time signature would be... well I won't ruin the fun.

Let me know your thoughts and reasonings and I'll tally up the responses!

TL;DR: Listen to [""American Baby (Intro)""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFnA-lbDsJ8), and tell us the time signature. We'll try to reach a consensus.

Edit: It seems like a slight majority of commenters are agreeing with me that this is 4/4 in two measure patterns. This is what I thought as well, with the drummer playing 3s over 4. Cool! Thanks for the help!

Edit 2: After reading more, I appreciate people begrudgingly listening to a band that they (oftentimes seem to very much) dislike. Like you, I tend to listen to a band that I don't enjoy if I end up finding the great musicianship in it.

My orginal post to this wonderful subreddit led me to start looking for other sources of information.

I stumbled upon this [review](http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.00.6.1/mto.00.6.1.rawlins.rev) of The Jazz Piano Book in which he brings some very harsh criticisms of Mark Levine's methods.  He basically calls them shortcuts.  I will add an excerpt that is relevant to the chapter on scale theory.



""[6] The most glaring example of this bias concerns a fundamental concept that permeates Levine's entire book--that of chord and scale equivalency. This view, in essence, assumes that any chord symbol used in jazz implies a full complement of upper extensions
(7th, 9th, 11th, and 13th), and accordingly can be reinterpreted
as some type of (usually) seven-note scale. For example, the
chord symbol Dm7, according to this approach, would imply a
possible 9th, 11th, and 13th, and would therefore be seen as
equivalent to the Dorian mode. It is an indisputable fact that
many jazz musicians share this view, and the expediency and
usefulness of this approach is not to be denied.(2) But in
establishing chord and scale relationships Levine seems to lose
sight of the fact that triadic progression is still the
underlying harmonic force driving most of the musical examples
presented in this book. A statement of such direct simplicity as
""the scale and the chord are two forms of the same thing"" (p. 33)
is an exaggeration and grossly misleading. A Cmaj7(9,#11,13)
serving as a tonic chord in the key of C and the same chord
serving as the subdominant in the key of G share the same notes,
and may both be thought of as verticalizations of the Lydian
mode, but they serve two entirely different functions in the
diatonic context, and are likely to be treated as such by the
improviser. Among other things, one contains the fourth degree of
the key, and the other does not. Perhaps Levine has stated the
true relationship of scale to mode more accurately when he
writes, ""The reason jazz musicians think of scales, or modes,
when they improvise, is because it's easier than thinking in
terms of chords"" (p. 32). But it may be necessary to think in
terms of chords when diatonic function is a significant component
of the harmonic motion.""

He then lists several sources as ""good examples""

I've picked the composer Arnold Bax, an English composer who fits in the interesting time period between the long 19th-century and 20th-century styles. At times, his music exhibits Romanticism while other times it exhibits Impressionism.

*The White Peace* is no exception to this as it has elements of both styles. I pick this particular piece for this reason. It opens itself up to a lot of different ways to analyze and understand this work. In addition, it's a song, which adds the benefit of possible text analysis.

Score here (sorry, non-PD EU): http://javanese.imslp.info/files/imglnks/usimg/1/1e/IMSLP19704-PMLP46203-Bax_-_The_White_Peace__voice_and_piano_.pdf

Recording here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M66j1zK_ATk

The text is as follows:
&gt;It lies not on the sunlit hill
&gt;Nor on the sunlit plain :
&gt;Nor ever on any running stream
&gt;Nor on the unclouded main --

&gt;But sometimes, through the Soul of Man,
&gt;Slow moving o'er his pain,
&gt;The moonlight of a perfect peace
&gt;Floods heart and brain.

The discussion can go anywhere, but I'll include some possible discussion questions that can get the juices flowing.

* How does the harmony portray the text? How does the text influence the melody/harmony?
* Though the work begins and ends on an Ab major triad, would you say that the piece always stays in Ab major?
* How does the form of the songs exhibit the form on the text - or does it? 
* What does this text mean to you?

Just a few ideas to get the discussion rolling!

I'll start a thread for nominations of another work (try to keep in on the smaller/shorter end if possible). After the discussion here runs out of steam, whichever piece receives the most upvotes will be the next in the series. (Requirements are that there has to be a recording available on a website that everyone can access, major bonus points for scores, lead sheets, or other notation.)

Cheers and I hope this starts a tradition :)

The weakness of this particular drill is that it only covers 6 of the 12 keys at a time (moves by whole step so it repeats every 7th iteration). The strengths are that it is very relaxing and fun, with nice little breaks at all the I▲ spots.

These drills have to sound good or else you won't want to play them, and they should be simply designed so you can go into the meditative zone while doing them. The purpose is to build an automatic intuitive connection between scales and chords. Playing tunes is also good practice, but some keys are much more rare than others, and drills guarantee you full coverage.

Do you have any personal favorites?

EDIT: Another good one is to just play the 2-5, and then turn the V7 into the ii7 of the next 2-5. This method will cover all 12 keys consecutively through the cycle of 5ths (moving down by 5ths). When you need a break you can land on the expected I▲, then shift back into the drill by turning that I▲ into a ii7 chord. A good larger pattern is three consecutive 2-5's followed by a I▲.

Caveat: I would also recommend a foundation in boogie-woogie improv to teach you how to think chordally. Chordal thinking and chord/scale thinking produce a nice synergy when approached in that order, and both are different ways of approaching the concurrent  vertical/horizontal heterarchy of music. I believe that both Bill Evans and Vince Guaraldi were boogie-woogiers before jazzers in their personal journeys; that's good empirical evidence.

but I don't know how scales are supposed to help me.

For example, the C major scale has the following notes in this order: C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C.

Does this mean that when I write a song in ""C major"" that my notes have to follow that order (C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C) or
can I arrange them in any way I want, like can write G-A-D-E-F-C-B-C?


If I can arrange them any way i want what is the purpose of intervals then in regards to scale? Like how a major scale
follows the interval formula of whole-whole-half-whole-whole-whole-half-whole?

I know this is a really noob question but I couldn't find another place to ask this. Any help would be appreciated.
