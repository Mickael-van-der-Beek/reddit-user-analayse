He wants his name to ring out throughout all of Bmore and be feared and respected for his power, which is why he's more willing to drop people for little signs or rumors of disrespect, which Michael notices is different from other drug lords. Prop Joe is more about the money, Stringer is more interested in becoming a legitimate businessman, and Avon is a gangster (I suppose) with less emphasis on respecting his person or name.


Asserting authority over the security guard in season 4 and asking ""you know who I am?"" on the street at the end of season 5 are examples of his need for people to fear him, but the moment that highlights this most is the ""my name is my name!"" scene. Learning that Omar has been calling him out by name in the street causes a burst of anger we'd never seen before in Marlo. 

Along these lines, today I realized how this emphasis on a name comes out in Marlo's speech. Marlo, who wants everyone to fear the name ""Marlo,"" uses the lack of names to put other people down. He calls Prop Joe ""fat man"" and Slim Charles ""tall man."" Denying two potential rivals of their name, in Marlo's mind, serves to deny power to these people.

Has anyone else noticed any instances of Marlo using names or lack of names about other people in a way to put himself above them?",,False,self,t5_2reco,False,,,True,t3_1hixu4,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1hixu4/marlos_use_of_names_spoilers_all/,

I'm still starstruck by the final episode and the final montage with the original title theme playing over it. The most impressive thing, for me, is that The Wire isn't a normal show, it's at its core pure politics. While almost every show or movie is about bad people cheating the honest system, this show is about the bad system betraying the honest people, 'The Wire' is reality. There aren't many movies or shows out there, that completely changed my view on things, in this case the struggle in the american drug culture and its impact on things as education, straight up police work, or peer pressure. Not only does The Wire combine absolutely brilliant writing, possibly the best I've seen for a series, but it mixes it up with a brilliant cast and so fucking original stories. I loved every single season, my favorite being 4 and 2. Even the fifth season, which I have read a lot of bad things about, completely blew me away, especially Bubbles Plot. 

It showed me a completely different side on drug addicts, on thugs growing up on the street and on the war on drugs. This series impacted me greatly, which by itself is the best a cinematic piece of work can achieve.

The only thing I didn't like about the wire was the decision to not include colvin and prezbo in the final season and maybe omar's death, but I guess it was dramatic enough that way.

As a passionate collector of movies and shows, I've seen a lot, but honest to god, nothing really changed something in me, until now.

Rewatching the show, I've found there's a moment in almost every episode that causes me to laugh out loud. I'm not saying it should be classified as a comedy or anything. However, there are moments of really clever, really dark comedy.

Samples:

""You got to be the dumbest motherfucker I done ever gone out with."" ""I can't wait to get to jail.""

Scene with Bunk trying to Burn his clothes.

""You taking notes on a mother-fucking criminal conspiracy?""

Scene trying to get the desk through the door.

""Fuck""

""Wedding ring? You married to the needle, boy!""

Wee-Bey/D'Angelo/Fish scene, possibly the greatest misdirection ever.

Bodie introducing Herc &amp; Carver to his and Poot's girlfriends. ""Herc and Carver here? They try and jack us every day.""

""Polk &amp; Mahone? Between them I don't even have a designated driver!""

**About the list**   

My intention was to create a list of shows that fans of the Wire might enjoy. Sort of an optimized version of: ""If you liked The Wire, you might also like..."" that you would see on some pre-programmed service.    

At the beginning of the list, you'll find four shows either made by David Simon, based off of shows written by him, or both. Immediately following is a list of highly praised shows suggested by the community of /r/TheWire. The order was created by the level of praise each show received either here or in general.   

If you would like to see the discussion that brought it about, [click here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1ds2ub/do_you_have_suggestions_for_shows_other_fans_of/)  

As any new shows come about or any changes in netflix or hbogo occur, I'll try to update. Thank you for your help, /r/TheWire, and I hope this list can be of some use for someone experiencing those post-Wire blues.

While I loved Season 2 both as a facet of The Wire and as an examination of the plight facing the blue-collar worker in the rust belt, I felt it was a bit disconnected from the rest of the series.

Certainly understanding where the drugs come from, how the connect is made between the high-level dealers and suppliers or understanding where Carcetti's base of white democrats comes from is necessary, but so few of the characters introduced in S2 reappear or play any type of role in the season. Frank Sobotka was one of my favorite characters, what with his internal conflict, but the outcome of his situation didn't really affect how the last three seasons played out.

I figure there was probably an older thread discussing this, but from your interpretation, how does Season 2 fit in? Why do you think Simon chose the longshoremen for S2? Considering that the second season of a series can often define it's viewership, I figure it would have been more accessible to do the politics in Season 2 (not that I expect Simon to have cared about popular appeal).

Let's not be mistaken, I think it's a great season and definitely provides a lot of context, but did it feel a little disconnected to anyone else? If you disagree, please explain. I'm going to be rewatching the whole series pretty soon and would like a little more nuanced understanding to some of the questions that still linger after having watched it the first time around.",,False,self,t5_2reco,False,,,True,t3_wi7zj,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/wi7zj/on_season_2/,

There's a number of things for the faint-hearted or first time viewers to know about The Wire before you jump in:

1. There is no denouement, no simple, clear resolution at the end of every episode ala CSI, NCIS, or any other typical police drama. On the contrary, The Wire is the epitome of the ""slow build"", it takes episodes to get started, much less finished. As in life, there are rarely any easy, clear resolutions at the end. Unlike the black and white worlds of network tv, The Wire is all gray.

2. There is not a simple, single story line. Rather The Wire is characterized by complex, multiple story arcs that can extend over more than one season. It demands (and rewards) concentration, rather than escape. Redemption and revenge are possible, but not in one episode or one season. The Wire requires patience.

3. There are no clear cut heroes and villains (this is the anti-""Heroes"" tv show.) There are only human beings, all flawed. McNulty, a hero, is an alcoholic who cheats on his wife. Even Marlowe, the apparently soulless villain, grapples with very human issues of loyalty and pride.

4. Though there are great, fully realized characters (almost too many for escapist viewers to follow), and though to some degree Baltimore, the city, is a central character, the abiding presences in The Wire are Baltimore's institutions and organizations: courts, city government, educational system, labor unions, police, newspapers. Even gangs are seen as just another organization. Unlike any other show I've ever seen, The Wire demonstrates how institutions are built from a complex web of relationships and motivations and seem to have an existence independent of those who participate in them. And it does so in such a subtle way that it's not automatically obvious. It doesn't appear to be about institutions, but it is. That's subtlety.

That's only a start. There's more that makes The Wire a challenge for viewers: it's non-linearity (it's more like a spiral), it's bleak view of cities and urban institutions; the seeming randomness of so many events that impact lives, etc., etc., etc.

All that said, The Wire, for those willing to make the investment of time and attention, is a transcendent, moving experience. However downbeat it's subject matter, it is, in the end, a true work of art, a masterwork, and as such ultimately enobling and uplifting. And just a thrill to watch.",,False,self,t5_2reco,False,,,True,t3_s40m7,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/s40m7/i_went_to_buy_the_complete_series_on_amazon_this/,

While I understand some of the hate towards Season 2 (because it was a big departure from S1 characters and the projects) I feel the actual case and the *building* of the case was one of the best in the show. I've rewatched S2 more than any other season and I love the feel of picking up the pieces and building the case along with the police. It had some great characters too; Boris (Sergei), the Greek, Frank Sobotka, etc

Because fuck Grantland, right?",WireMadness,87,13,204,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/qk5tg/rthewires_64character_march_madness_tournament/,"So in the topic discussing Grantland's March Madness tourney, there seemed to be a good amount of people upset with the way they did things. A lot of good characters like Slim Charles and Carver were missing, while a key character like Bubbles was seeded below fucking Sergei/Boris. While the editors of Grantland may not remember some of the more minor characters from the show, I know we have a good group of hardcore fans here who will want to vote on just about everyone.

So here's how this will work. First off, this is a throwaway account so it's not a karma-grab. I'm going to comment with every character's name that I can think of. It will likely be more than 64 characters. ***If you like a character, upvote them. Please do not downvote. I can see the exact number of upvotes/downvotes for each character anyway so I'm only going to count upvotes. You can vote for as many characters as you want, if you want to see a minor character in the tourney, be sure to give them some love*** (once you're done tossing votes to the Omars and Stringers of the world). 

I'll leave this open for a few days and let everyone get a chance to have their say, then organize it into a seeded tournament. The top four vote-getters will be 1 seeds, the next four will be 2 seeds, etc etc. From there on we'll move on to actual voting to determine the Best Character on The Wire. And see how it compares to Grantland.

If you don't remember who someone is, [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Wire_characters) has a good list that covers all the minor characters too.

We're enjoying it, but I don't love it like I love The Wire. Obviously I'm not alone. (Of course I realize I'd get different responses if I posted this in /r/BreakingBad ..)

So my question is: Why?

Obviously the shows are about different characters and different scenarios, and they emphasize different things. Still, I feel a deep connection with the characters of TW in a way that I'm just not getting with BB. (Odd, since BB follows a *much* smaller cast, which would seem to suggest a deeper connection.) 

Here's what I've come up with on my own:

* BB revolves around some pretty unlikely coincidences. I won't go into spoilers for the benefit of those who haven't seen it, but there are quite a few things that make it almost impossible to suspend disbelief.

* I'm finding a *lot* of similarities between Walter White and Don Draper (from Mad Men). They're both egomaniacs who regularly do things for very opaque reasons. This makes them harder to like than, say, McNulty. All three guys are basically jerks, but McNutty somehow redeems himself in ways that the other two don't. I feel like AMC shows are more willing to lurk in the weird shadows of human uncertainty, whereas HBO shows (I'm thinking also of Oz and The Sopranos) confront scenarios in a more factual head-on style.

* BB doesn't really deal with social issues like TW does. Once in a while we'll get a passing view of the arbitrary nature of the law, but it never goes very far (and never does much for me other than make me say: ""Yeah, I was waiting for that"").

I'd love to know what other folks think, especially if you've seen both shows. (But please no spoilers -- and remember that I'll be reading your comments as new messages, so the spoiler tag won't cover it up in that mode!)",,False,self,t5_2reco,False,,,True,t3_15rv04,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/15rv04/breaking_bad_vs_the_wire/,

**Books**:

* *Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets* (1991)

David Simon's book that started it all. Follows Baltimore homicide detectives through 1988 as they roam the streets of Baltimore. Also provides great glimpses into the bureaucratic hell that is the Baltimore City Police Department. People who love ""The Wire"" ***need*** to read this book as it contains dozens of references to the show as well as giving a provocative insight to the life of a homicide detective.

* *The Corner: The Corner: A Year in the Life of an Inner-City Neighborhood* (1997)

David Simon and Edward Burns' first collaboration and a harrowing account of the slow decline of Baltimore. Follows the touts, drug dealers, addicts, community activists, and people who make West Baltimore their home. The book mostly follows the McCullough family who were torn apart by drug addiction. Also a must read for those who love ""The Wire"" as the book explains how Baltimore became a ghetto and how the drug dealing game evolved (as well as numerous references to The Wire... PANDEMIC! DIAMOND IN THE RAW!). DeAndre McCullough would later portray Lamar (Brother Mouzone's assistant) in ""The Wire."" 

* *Clockers* (1992)

Fictional story involving drug dealers and cops in a (fictional) New Jersey city. Mostly follows drug dealer Ronald ""Strike"" Dunham and homicide detective Rocco Klein. Worth a read.

* *Gomorrah* (2006)

The book goes into the underground world of the Camorra, the Neapolitan crime syndicate that controls the city of Naples, Italy and it's surrounding areas. After Roberto Saviano wrote this book, he received death threats and is now in hiding with help of the Italian government. 

* *Donnie Brasco: My Undercover Life in the Mafia* (1997)

Joseph D. Pistone's autobiographical account of his FBI work against the Bonanno family, one of the five families of New York, which led to one of the most successful FBI crime operations ever.

* *There Are No Children Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the Other America* (1991)

I'll admit I haven't finished this one yet but it's still a good read so far. True account of two brothers living in the Henry Horner Homes of Chicago's poverty stricken ghettos.

**Movies**:

* Snow on tha Bluff (2012)

After robbing three college students during a drug deal, Curtis Snow films his life as a stick up artist and gangster in Atlanta. Curtis must dodge police and rival gang members in order to survive in ""The Bluff,"" one of Atlanta's toughest neighborhoods. Produced by Michael K. Williams (Omar Little).

* Gomorrah (2008)

Roberto Saviano's book that was brought to the screen. Nothing short of excellent.

* City of God (Cidade de Deus) (2002)

One of the best movies ever made but I have a feeling only a few of you guys have seen this one. Follows the beginnings and evolution of gangs in Rio De Janeiro's ""Cidade de Deus"" suburb. I really can't state just how phenomenal this movie is. 

* Donnie Brasco (1997)

Johnny Depp plays Joseph D. Pistone and Al Pacino as his friend Benjamin ""Lefty"" Ruggiero. Based on the book of the same name.

* The Godfather Part I and II (1972 and 1974)

You all know these two movies. Francis Ford Coppola's account of immigration, family values, organized crime, and the American dream. Stars Pacino, De Niro, John Cazale, Marlon Brando, James Caan, and a plethora of other acting greats.

* Bus 174 (2002)

Brazilian documentary about the hostage situation on Bus 174. The movie touches on many issues that plague Brazilian society including poverty and corruption. 

* Serpico (1973)

Film that follows Al Pacino as Frank Serpico, a policeman who fought corruption in the NYPD despite facing harassment and threats from his fellow officers. 

* Dog Day Afternoon (1975)

Dio Mio! This italo-americano has a hard on for Al Pacino! You're not wrong but this film is awesome. Based on the real life hostage situation and robbery of a New York City bank. John Cazale (from the Godfather I and II) costars as Pacino's partner in crime.

* Clockers (1995)

Based off of the book of the same name. Spike Lee directed. Worth a watch but nothing special. Wee Bey is in the movie though for what it's worth.

* Infernal Affairs (2002) and The Departed (2006)

Infernal Affairs is the Hong Kong movie that inspired The Departed. Both are really good films with excellent casts.

* Once Upon a Time in America (1984)

Sergio Leone (The Man with No Name Trilogy) account of the forgotten Jewish-American gangsters. Stars Robert De Niro and James Woods. ***WARNING!!!*** The original theatrical version was cut down significantly by the movie studios so you need to watch the longer versions. Trust me on this one folks.

* Juice (1992)

Stars the phenomenal Tupac Shakur. Follows the destruction of a group of friends from Harlem, NY. This movie goes well with the next selection.

* Above the Rim (1994)

A young and promising basketball player struggles living with his single mother. Watch as he is influenced by a pair of brothers (Leon Robinson, Tupac Shakur), one good and the other bad. Wood Harris (Avon Barksdale) plays a ruthless gangster and Tupac's partner in crime. 

* Menace II Society (1993)

Gritty portrayal of life in South LA. Follows a recent high school graduation as he robs and hustles with his loose-cannon best friend. Movie goes hand in hand with the next selection.

* Boyz n the Hood (1991)

The movie that started the ""gangster/hood films"" that were a big part of the 90s and the burgeoning West Coast G-Funk gangsta rap scene. Stars Ice Cube and Cuba Gooding Jr. as friends who grow up in South LA's poverty stricken neighborhoods. John Singleton directed.

* Friday (1995)

Hilarious day in the life in the ghetto of South LA. Stars Ice Cube as Craig and Chris Tucker in a memorable performance as stoner extraordinaire ""Smokey"" as they try to dodge gang members, neighborhood bullies, and their own stupidity. Who says the ghetto life has to always be serious?

**TV Shows**:

* Breaking Bad

No introduction needed here. Brian Cranston as a chemistry teacher who ""breaks bad"" and joins the burgeoning crystal meth trade after a recent cancer diagnosis. 

* Homicide: Life on the Street Seasons 1 and 2 (1993)

I only selected the first two seasons as they were the best (biased opinion, I know). Based on David Simon's book of a similar name and touches on many of the cases discussed in the book. Solid but nothing special. Andre Braugher puts in a helluva performance.

* The Corner (2000)

Wonderfully directed adaptation of David Simon and Ed Burns' book of a similar name. Many of the cast that are in ""The Wire"" appear in this show. 

* City of Men (Cidade dos Homens) (2002)

A spin off of the movie. Worth watching if you enjoyed City of God. Haven't gotten to far into the series.

* Oz (1997)

Follows the lives of the prisoners and staff at the fictional Oswald State Correctional Facility in New York. This show is very much like ""The Wire"" because of its social commentary. Also stars many actors from ""The Wire."" HBO's first 1 hour show. 

* Boardwalk Empire (2010)

Also stars many of the cast on ""The Wire,"" Boardwalk Empire is ""The Wire"" but takes place in prohibition era America. Stars Steve Buscemi as Nucky Thompson, bootlegger extraordinaire and corrupt politician. What strikes me as fascinating about this show is how historically accurate it is. I've never seen Jewish, Italian, and Irish gangs portrayed the way they are. Show is nothing short of fantastic. Like other HBO shows, many actors from ""The Wire"" make an appearance. Notorious gangsters Bugsy Siegel, Lucky Luciano, Arnold Rothstein, Al Capone, Meyer Lansky, and other bootleggers, hitmen, and psychopaths who made millions in illegal booze and heroine. WATCH THIS SHOW!!!

* The Sopranos (1999)

Legendary show. James Gandolfini heads an excellent ensemble as Tony Soprano, the patriarch of an Italian-American family heavily involved in the mafia.

1355425544.0,59,self.TheWire,14sra8,"Season 3: Reform Lamar, Reform ",Serio-,69,10,11,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/14sra8/season_3_reform_lamar_reform/,"The theme of reform is evidenced throughout season 3 of The Wire.  Although most will naturally think of Cutty's reformation (and that's part of it), it goes far beyond that.  Drug dealers, politicians, police officers, and the entirety of Baltimore as a whole deal with personal and city-wide reform throughout season 3.


As David Simon explains:



&gt; ""Season 3 reflects on the nature of reform and reformers, and whether there is any possibility that political processes, long calcified, can mitigate against the forces currently arrayed against individuals.""



This theme is clearly stated from the beginning of season 3, starting with ""Time After Time"" (s3e01).  The title of the episode itself is a reference to the cyclical process of initiating reform, change and return to the status quo.


Also, when Mayor Royce announces the demolition of the Franklin Terrace Towers, initially everyone is clearly happy as cheers and applauds surround the area.  However, their optimism soon leaves them as dust envelopes the area and they see the physical consequences of the towers.  I was watching this episode with my father as I'm taking him through the seasons and this was clear to me then.  As Wikipedia explains:


&gt; ""This is symbolic of this season's theme of reform and its consequences that may not be immediately visible on the surface.  We've seen touches of this in season 2 with the announcement of the condominiums being built by the docks.


There are further examples shown in episode one, clearly showing Simon's thematic intentions.  For instance, take Bodie's conversation with Poot, also in the opening.  


&gt; ""Don't matter how many times you get burnt, you just keep doin' the same."" - Bodie


Although Bodie is clearly referring to Poot's repetitive behavior with women, it also refers to the season's theme of reform through explaining entrenched behavior.  Further attributing to this theme, we see McNulty alluding to the theme later in the episode.  While examining the files for the original Barksdale case and port case, he remarks to Massey, ""If you don't look at what you did before, you do the same shit all over.""  As Wikipedia states, McNulty could just as easily be talking about himself because he is showing signs of continuing the same kind of egotistical insubordination that he did in the first season.  I didn't really understand how this related to reform until I understood what entrenched behavior is, essentially meaning being stuck in one place where you feel safe, but are unable to move backwards or forwards without danger.  This definition helps explain how reform relates to Poot and McNulty's respective situations.


There are further examples in episode 10 entitled ""Reformation.""  The title clearly refers to the theme of season three as various characters are struggling to initiate reform on a personal and citywide level.  For instance, we see Dennis ""Cutty"" Wise struggling with personal reform as he clearly doesn't have the heart for the drug game anymore.  This is also the episode when Brother Mouzone remarks to Lamar on their return to the city:


&gt; ""Reform Lamar, Reform"" - Brother Mouzone


Wikipedia goes on to state that his remarks center on the empty political promises of reform in Baltimore, marked by the collapse of the towers.


As stated previously, several characters show signs of reform either on a personal level, or they are trying to stimulate some type of city-wide change.  For instance, and this began back in season 2, we see Stringer Bell clearly trying to reform his organization, and the drug game as a whole.  ""You see people driving around in Toyota, Honda, territory don't mean shit.""  Not only that, he is trying to get into legitimate businesses.  Also, on the other end of the spectrum we have Bunny Colvin, very blatantly trying to reform the war on drugs in his Hamsterdam experiment.  As a side note, this reform and social commentary on the war on drugs in America is a clear criticism from David Simon.


Also, we find a new character in Councilman Thomas Carcetti.  Although not a personal reform, he is trying to reform the city and the overwhelming crime problem during season 3.  As he states in late season 3 to Tony Gray, ""Fuck the politics for once.""


Finally, we slowly see the personal reforms of one of my favorite characters, Ellis Carver.  They are tough to spot but it's clear, the way he handles the kids in Hamsterdam, the looks he gives Herc while Herc is being an idiot in front of Bunny, and the way he handles his lecture from Bunny at the end of the season, Carver shows great change.  Although we don't see the complete transformation of Carver until the first episode of season 4, the personal reforms he makes are clear.  Notice the very first line he says in season 4:


&gt; ""Where's the love Bodie?  Where's the mother fucking love?""


This line should be evidence enough that there was a massive change in Carver.  Not only that, he knows everyone's names on the corner, as well as even the youngin's, it's clear that although he was already changing in the middle of season 3, Bunny's talk on what actual police work is truly hit home.


I know this isn't the tightest piece of writing and that some ideas are simply thrown out there, but hell I graduated this semester, no more essays.  


As a general conclusion, it is clear that the theme of reform encompasses the entirety of season 3, as dealers, politicians, and police battle with personal and city-wide reform.

Before Bodie and Poot kill Wallace, they take him out to dinner. The way they were positioned in their seats is what interested me since it relates back to the game of Chess.

[Dinner Picture](http://i.imgur.com/z5deQXh.jpg)

Notice how Wallace is sitting across from Bodie. Poot is diagonal from Wallace. What's interesting about the concept of pawns in Chess is that they can only attack diagonally in front of them. When Bodie and Poot eventually kill Wallace, Bodie can't bring the final shot because, as a pawn, he can't attack straight in front of him. But, since Poot is diagonal, he's the one that delivers the final blow to Wallace.

I'm in law school now (wasn't when I first watched the show) so I was thinking about the purpose behind criminal statutes (specifically drug possession laws) and what role they play. Why do we have these laws, and what purpose do they serve? 

One could argue the entire show is about this, but I realized it's really encapsulated in Season 1 in a subtle and rather brilliant way. Really drug statutes are ultimately about making sure people don't get addicted to drugs, because of the negative effects that has on society. But Kima's relationship with Bubbles demonstrates how this gets lost in the shuffle. I mean, you have a cop, going after drug dealers, but using a druggie as her informant/contact. And she PAYS him for information to bust the dealers - thus allowing him to get high and perpetuate the problem that the law is originally designed to prevent. So the way Simon crafts it, in the larger view she's getting someone more addicted to drugs in order to enforce a law that is ostensibly supposed to help prevent drug addiction from becoming a problem. And this is just a highly inefficient waste of resources.

And this is illustrated even moreso when Bubbles calls Kima when he's trying to get clean. But she's been injured trying to catch the dealers. Here is a drug addict who DIRECTLY needs help but the institution is too busy basically playing a game to give a shit.

Even without everything else the show gets into, this right here is perhaps the strongest case/example for why criminalizing drugs is ineffective/inefficient and more good could be done by directly helping the people who need it. Obviously, Hamsterdam illustrates that issues would arise with just getting rid of the statutes entirely, but if the goal is helping people, criminalization is such a roundabout way of achieving that. 

NOTE: Rereading this makes it seem like Kima is bad in some way for doing what she's doing, far from it. She's doing her job and the problem is systemic rather than individual (and she's certainly not to blame for getting shot when Bubbles calls). But, I think the level of abstraction is interesting. Ultimately legislators ask police officers to enforce the laws and the police officers don't really have a chance to ask why, or if what they're doing is actually helping or making the problem worse. Not a knock on their profession, more an issue with the approach taken to the problem.",,False,self,t5_2reco,False,,,True,t3_1ate15,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1ate15/kima_bubbles_and_the_war_on_drugs/,

The first being when some free real estate opens up and Marlo tries to get Slim to step up, however Slim said something like ""Nah I'm good,"" simply knowing it wasn't his place and shortly after Joe said that it was for East Side.  Another occasion like this occurs in season 5 when once again, this time after Hungry Man's demise, we see Marlo trying to offer the space to Slim (""how bout you Tall Man?""), once again Slim declines (""I'm not cut out to be no CEO"").

Perhaps another piece of evidence occurs in season 5 when Omar comes after Slim to extract information due to Butchie's death.  After essentially being pistol whipped Slim uses logic and tells Omar to look at it from Joe's point of view, why would he kill Butchie?  Of coursing ending it with the standard ""Do what you feel.""  Omar, being logical as hell understands what Slim is saying and leaves.

Finally, to top it all off, Slim Charles does what the viewer and everyone in the Wire universe is wanting him to do, he takes out the Cheese (""That was for Joe.)""  As David Simon said, ""It was a betrayal too far and Slim had some feeling for one of his old bosses.""  And obviously everyone knows you can see him in the montage with Fat Face Rick talking to Vondas in the season 5 montage, assuming the throne at pretty much the best possible time.

Some other small things that I think should be mentioned but aren't as big as the others include the fact that Avon and Prop Joe seem to have a hell of a lot of confidence in him (""I'm leaving Cheese in charge to watch over things... you watch over Cheese""), his refusal to Stringer to hit Senator Davis (""murder ain't no thing.. but this here is some assasination type shit""), his use of logic in the planned hit of the Stanfield corner, the fact that he had Marlo in his sights at the end of season 3 and could have executed had McNulty and son not kicked the door in, maybe you can even include the fact that he still mentors Bodie and Poot despite them not being in the same crew anymore.

So, what are some characters that you love that aren't known as major characters?

Throughout the other seasons while McNulty drinks, trains are on the tracks moving towards him or standing still, but in season four when he quits drinking, the one time he is shown at the train tracks one train car is shown off the tracks in the background.

The razor sharp intelligence of Marlo and Chris.  The social problems of kids growing up in an impoverished area.  The challenge of educating children raised to distrust authority their whole lives.  And to top it off the ridiculously good acting by pretty much EVERYONE.  Bubz, Snoop &amp; Chris, Omar, Bunk, Michael, Bunny Colvin, Norman ... I just love every minute of those guys.

The only thread I like better from another season is Bubbles' recovery in Season 5.  Other than that Season 4 is the greatest 13 episodes of television ever created.

Typically, season 5 is viewed as the worst season (still good though) out of the 5 of them. The first two times I watched the show, I agreed. However, this last time around, I noticed more subtleties that made me appreciate what Simon was doing. If you can put aside the absurdity of a police faking the existence of a serial killer, you may be able to appreciate some of the metaphors. Essentially, the entire season works to reprise many of the themes from previous seasons by drawing some pretty eloquent parallels between the various groups (police, politicians, journalists and street dealers). The four systems have more in common than they'd ever care to admit, demonstrated by the parallels the writers construct. This was largely inspired by some of the parallels I've seen people here make between various characters (Namond and Clay each saying ""I'll take any motherfucker's money if he's givin it away,"" is the most prevalent example.) I've tried to structure this as best I could. Hope it sheds some light on the season for those of you who didn't like it. 

**“You believe everything you read?”**

This scene happens in the beginning of season 5. Dozerman and McNulty are on the roof and he's asking him if what he read in field reports is true. Did he really bang two hookers on the job? McNulty's response is an extreme example of foreshadowing about the lies the newspaper reporters will tell.

**“Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to work at a real fucking newspaper.”**

Uttered outside at a smoke break. The cops have the same sentiment, and their version of this quote appears several times throughout the series. Employees recognize that both institutions are completely fucked, from the ground up, and wonder what their jobs would be like if things were different, if only things could change.

**Doing more with less**

Both the police department and the newspaper are facing severe budget cuts. For the newspaper, this means less staff to cover the same amount of news. For the police department, this means wearing the cops out with unpaid overtime, broken down cars, etc. Higher-ups on both sides urge their subordinates to learn to live with slashed budgets. Obviously the budget issues hit the mayor's office too, as they have to make tough decisions in where to direct the little funds they have to work with.

**One thieving politician trumps 22 dead bodies**

Both Carcetti and members of the police department (Daniels) are disgusted by the way the state's office is using resources to go after Clay Davis while 22 murders from the vacant row houses remain unsolved, with no funding to work the case.

**Made up quotes vs. made up killer**

Bunk has a line that goes “the bigger the lie, the more they believe” when they trick the kid with the ""lie detector"" test, which is another example of foreshadowing. Essentially, this is the theme of season 5 in a microcosm. Lies reflecting lies. The lies of Scott Templeton reflect the lies of McNulty. In the beginning, when Scott makes up quotes and sources for his stories and when McNulty starts to fabricate murders. Both lies just continue to escalate as the season goes on. On the newspaper side, it's Gus who suspects Scott is lying and on the police side, Bunk knows McNulty is lying, but both are essentially powerless to stop it.

**“Marlo doesn't get to win, we do”**

I can't remember who says this (McNulty?), but it's a direct parallel from when Carver jumps on top of the cop car and screams “You do not get to win, shitbird! We do!” at the beginning of season 4. Again, reprising the idea that some police have about how important it is to *win* when attacking these criminals, at all costs (see the next entry):

**“There are no rules. Fuckin game's rigged.”**

McNulty says this several times throughout the series, and it's true at both the Sun and within the PD. This philosophy gives Scott room to lie (make up quotes, sources, talking to the killer) in order to further his career, the same way it gives Jimmy the room to fabricate the serial killer to get funding and man-hours. It's also true the deeper you go into the police department when you consider the way the PD cooks the book/jukes the stats to make it seem like crime is going down, as well as all the bullshit journalist peddle to win Pulitzers. Lester has a quote later on about acting “without regard to the regular rules” when trying to rationalize their actions, which I loved.

**“It's Baltimore. No one lives forever.”**

Carcetti quote. Pretty self explanatory. Applies to the streets, literally, and figuratively regarding the careers of the police, politicians and journalists.

**""Dead where it doesn't count""** 

This is the part where Alma's story about the dead drug dealers gets chopped down to a few paragraphs, buried somewhere in the middle of the paper. The cops are shown reading the article and they can't believe that the deaths of such major players are getting such little coverage. Each sides discuss black vs. white – this is also right after the part where Jimmy and Lester come back from the “crime scene” they want to rig, the one that's swarming with police to the point where they can't work with it. A made up serial killer is murdering homeless white men in the Southern and the whole city goes ape shit. Major black players in the West and East get popped almost daily and nobody gives a shit, just a couple more dead black folks in the streets.

**Kicking the cop cars**

There are parallel scenes between season 4 and 5 – one where Bodie is tired of the bullshit after Lil Kev gets got, and he takes out his frustration on a parked cruiser. Then on the roof of the parking garage downtown where Jimmy finally finds the car he's assigned and it has a flat tire, all battered and worthless, and he kicks the shit out of it until he hurts his foot. Same thing. Parallel frustrations within each system.

**Daniels/Gus handing out assignments at parallel staff meetings**

Pretty self explanatory. Gus and Daniels are each shown with their crews around them, going over assignments, what's expected of the staff. Wonderful juxtaposition.

**“You start to tell the story, you think that you're the hero and then when you get done talking --”**

I think this goes for all sides of the game. Jimmy, obviously, Scott Templeton making himself the center of the serial killer story by lying, Carcetti in the mayor's office realizing he's essentially powerless to fix any of the city's problems, each of the major players in the drug game who fall victim to the system. McNulty is cut off by Beadie walking away, out of his life in a really emotional scene.

**The Diner**

There are lots of scenes in seasons 3-5 involving the same diner, where Carcetti meets with members of the PD and other politicians, but also where Gus meets with old colleagues and politicians. Just another way of connecting the different groups.

**“Fuck, fuck, fucking fuck”**

This one's subtle. So subtle that I didn't notice it til my third time around. This is some guy (his name isn't even important, he's a minor character) in the newsroom eating his lunch (yogurt, I think), and he's so disgusted and frustrated with the monotony that he's swearing the same way Jimmy and Bunk were during that infamous re-canvassing scene.

**The file in the drawer**

Another subtle but important parallel. Gus brings in an investigator to go through Scott's stories, interview sources and see if they actually said what Scott says they did. The consensus is no, he fabricated tons of quotes over the years. In the police department, Burrell has the file on Daniels that details the FBI's investigation for his embezzlement crimes. Both files could destroy the careers of the people involved. But neither Burrell nor Gus can really make the play, for fear of getting dirty in exposing the person they've come to rival, mostly because of local politics. Scott is the chosen one, favored by the higher-ups, same as Daniels.",,False,self,t5_2reco,1353424416.0,,,True,t3_13hv2g,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/13hv2g/the_case_for_season_5_spoilersobviously/,

I think it would be nice to know certain comments are coming from those rare Season 2 lovers, whereas other posts are from someone who has the exact same BofI number as you.

It might be even more fun when combined with certain alliances or groups people can be aligned with.

I think that the serial killer in Season 5 is a direct reference to the DC sniper case from 2002. 

Reasons:

1. The case was incredibly over-hyped; with 13 total shootings in an area that has a total population of nearly 6 million people-- you had about a 100x higher chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime (1/10,000) than of being one of the victims. Recess &amp; sporting events were cancelled across DC, VA, &amp; MD; gas stations started erecting tarps to ""shield"" people; and it made the cover of magazines across the country. Meanwhile, there were Baltimore gangs that killed more people in a weekend.

2. There was a leak in the police department that told the media about a tarot card that asked the police department to ""call me God""-- despite the card explicitly asking for it not to be released to the media. There were also a series of phone calls made to the police by Malvo &amp; Muhammed (which supposedly provided the lead that led to their arrest) as well as cryptic, rambling messages made by the Montgomery County police referring to nooses, ducks, etc. that were never explained to the public-- not even at trial. Also, no recording of this phone call was ever presented at trial.


3. The description of the suspect(s) went from a white male with military experience/training driving a white van (for weeks) to 2 black males (with zero weapons training) driving a blue caprice in a time span of hours. There is still no clear motive behind the murder spree except ""terrorism"" and the argument that Muhammed was prepping to kill his Ex-wife in a way that would make it look random (this was not allowed in trial, due to lack of evidence). Furthermore, police would later argue that Muhammed shoplifted the (almost 3-foot) .223 rifle, since they couldn't provide evidence of purchase. Given the difficulty of some of the shots (100 yards, one bullet), many wondered how Muhammed became a keen shot, to which police argued that he self taught how to snipe at firing ranges (specifically Bull's Eye gun range). This begs the question how did he get into the firing range without gun registration. By far the most damning evidence was their psuedo-confessions.

4. The case became a huge political touchstone, especially with democrats, who pounced on then-governor Ehrlich with support from gun control advocates. The duo were both publicly tried in both VA and MD, giving big PR to some DAs. Montgomery County police chief Charles Moose, who headed the investigation, would later write a book about the series as well as consult for a movie. The department, which wanted to keep certain details secret, fired him for doing so. 


Anyone else seeing the parallels? I wonder how much more there is to the case-- and how much Simon was privy to due to his time at The Sun. This also all occurred between 2002 and 2006-- right when Simon &amp; Burns would have been planning season 5. Any thoughts?

EDIT: I also want to make on more point. Plot lines in The wire are consistently historically accurate, from how O'Malley won the mayoral election, Sheila Dixon's corruption, Donnie Andrew's life as the real Omar, Bubbles based on Ed Burn's snitch by the same name, the elimination of the docks and their unions; it seams out of place that the 5th season would suspend his loyalty to authenticity

It's debatable whether Stringer wanted to wear the crown. Stringer knew there were ""games beyond 'the game'"", and ultimately seemed focused on making himself and his earnings legitimate; however, he appears reluctant to return full power to Avon upon Avon's release from prison.

But what about Prop Joe?

I felt like Prop Joe was motivated by money alone which is why he brings the idea of a co-op to Stringer: increase profits and reduce cost (stop beefs and feuds which led to bodies and made business more costly). I can't think of any specific moments where Prop Joe comes off as power hungry.

When Bodie and Poot go to hit Wallace, Bodie stops at the top of the stairs to put on his doo-rag and the camera shows Poot staring back, as if he is thinking about pulling out. Bodie nods his head at Poot and reluctantly, Poot he walks up the stairs, following into Bodie into the room where they eventually put a few bullets in Wallace.

I didn't think much about it until the same thing happens with Daniels and McNulty when they put Avon in cuffs. This time, Daniels is at the bottom of the stairs, and we see Jimmy at the top of the stairs looking back to the room that Stringer is sitting in. Daniels nods his head at Jimmy, and Jimmy follows him outside.

Poot knows he doesn't need to kill Wallace, he knows the boy doesn't need to die, he just needs to get out of the game. Poot has a chance to just walk away and not kill Wallace, maybe Bodie kills Wallace regardless, but maybe Poot convinces him otherwise. Either way, Poot has a choice. The same is true with Mcnulty. Mcnulty *knows* that he should put Stringer in cuffs, he *knows* that he has a chance to put him away, or at least make an attempt, but he puts those thoughts behind him and follows Daniels outside.

I just think this is a testament to how amazing this show his. It is a perfect example of how everything and everyone on this show is connected; from the dealers to the cops to the politicians and lawyers, they are all connected.

I've seen many different theories and a lot of very reasonable assumptions, the one I see often is the idea that the trains represent the institutions: you can't stop them, you can't alter their path, and if you stand in front of them, you will be crushed.

Wow, I can barely believe it myself, I thought Omar was a lock, but Bodie prevailed in an absolutely nail-biting final, 150-147. 

I'm sure this will generate a ton of discussion. Use the comments to get some good Omar/Bodie arguments going(or maybe say why your favorite was knocked out way too early!). Some of the stuff that people wrote during the finals was the best all tournament. And overall some of the analytical comments about characters were the best I've seen on this subreddit.

Some of my favorite are:

* Colvin takes the kids for steak.
* McNulty in the marine unit. That Baltimore knot. One of the funniest moments ever.
* Omar wearing a tie in court
* Stringer Bell frustrated by bureaucracy of legit business that he wants to kill a state senator. First time you see Stringer going gangsta. 
* Marlo in a suit and tie
* Carcetti's campaign as the white mayor of a black city
* D'Angelo out on a date at the Inner harbor

Doesn't abide by the rules of the game, just takes the money for himself. Everyone knows he does it, let's him do it, because ""it's America."" Also interesting that Snot Boogie's real name is also Omar.

Hey.

Just got through watching all 5 seasons for the first time.

Gotta tell you, awesome show, but really hard for a non-native speaker.

I had this idea of re-watching some good scenes on youtube after I finished watching an episode. Now, if you haven't watched all episodes, DO NOT USE YOUTUBE for re-watching.

People labeling the videos really do put major spoilers in the title. You won't keep yourself from glancing at the related videos, and if you just take a quick look at them, a lot of plot twists and unforseen events will be ruined. 

I spoiled quite some great scenes for myself and just wanted to warn you from making the same mistake. Just find the scene in the episode you just watched, even if it takes a little longer.

Just putting it out there because I haven't seen a post about this.

Good day

ok. so. I enjoy Portlandia. I think it's funny. The current season (three) of the show has a sketch called ""Spoiler Alert"" where the two main characters and two others go back and forth generally giving away key details of many popular television shows and movies. They covered Lost, Mad Men, Harry Potter, etc. and overall, it's funny to watch. While watching this, I say out loud to my wife, ""They better not ruin The Wire for me"". Just as those prophetic words came out of my mouth, Fred Armisan says with his wide eyes,  [""Omar....he gets killed by a little kid?!""](/spoiler) .......................my jaw dropped.

At that moment I was about five episodes from said event. It's all I could think about and it pretty much ruined the moment. When the event happened, I was not surprised, but just muttered ""yep"" to myself. My wife came in a little later and I confirmed the event (she never watches a full episode--her loss) and she asked if I cried. Maybe I did. Portlandia spoiled The Wire for me. Consider this a cautionary tale.

2. Pearlman and Freamon -  Pearlman was the only one smart enough to keep up with Lester much of the time.  She knew what he was doing when nobody else really did.

I'm on my 4th or 5th go round of the show now and i'm still finding new things. I was thinking it might be cool to pool some of the easily overlooked stuff here, i'll start off

* At the end of S01E08, Bunk goes home with a woman he meets at the bar (He ends up wearing her pink nightrobe, sat on the toilet). The woman is played by the actress who plays Randy's foster mother ""Miss Anna"". I really don't know if it's the same character though as she clearly lives in a different place and also there seems to be a big difference in how she comes across in S1 as compared with S4. Any ideas?

* In S5, one of the homeless people under the freeway is one of the dockers who worked under Frank Sobotka in S2. (surely intentional)

* A friend of mine says that in S1 you can see Michael's mother walking around the low rises with a baby (presumably, Bug) though i can't confirm this myself. 

* You can actually see even midway through S1 that Burrell has something over Daniels though ii isn't really acknowledged or talked about til much later. That one might be obvious to some people but i only just noticed it. 

* Jay Landsman was an actual person in the BPD and he even audiotioned for the role as himself. Apparently he wasn't a good enough version of himself and was instead cast as [Dennis Mello](http://seriesaddict.fr/images/galerie/The-Wire/promo3x04/Dennis%20Mello%20-1.jpg)

It doesn't help his cause that he basically only shows up for the last two or three episodes of a couple seasons.

So am I totally wrong about this?  Was there a real-life counterpart to Brother Mouzone like there was to Omar or Tommy Carcetti or any of the dozens of other great characters?

But I rewatched the episode last night, and I've taken a broader scope to what Marlo said.

**""You want it to be one way...""**

On the most basic level possible, the guard was exercising his will against Marlo's.  His humble plea for Marlo's compliance is a manifestation of his desire to be respected as a man, which Marlo denies.  The guard never cites his authority in their exchange, and never tells Marlo what he ""ought"" to do; he immediately levels with him, telling Marlo that he's working a shitty job to support his family.  The ""one way"" is simply what the guard wants; his self-interest, his autonomy, his expression of free will.

**""..but it's the other way""**

Marlo rejects the guard's effort to impose his will on him, even a little bit.  In Marlo's mind, no one has the right to challenge his own ""way"", and the penalty for doing so is death.

Marlo is fundamentally denying the guard's autonomy as a human being.  In encroaching on Marlo's ""way"", even in something as trivial as petty shoplifting, the guard is implicitly trying to control Marlo.  This is an unforgivable offense to Marlo, who seeks absolute power.

Results from the Final Four:

* (1) Bodie defeats (2) McNulty 87-82
* (1) Omar defeats (1) Stringer 120-45

Whew. Nearly a month later and here we are - down to just two. Omar and Bodie have come a long way in this tournament. As predicted, Omar handily won just about all of his matchups, eliminating Little Kevin, Poot, Prez, Cutty and most recently, Stringer Bell. Meanwhile, Bodie knocked off Johnny Weeks, Butchie, Daniels, Bunk and McNulty on his way to the finals. Now the two go head-to-head in the Not-David-Simon-Approved Finals. Will Omar triumph as he has in just about every Wire-related ""Best Character"" discussion? Or is a Bodie a smart-ass pawn that's about to come at the king (and hopefully not miss)?

I want to thank WireMadness2 for stepping in and doing the Final Four while I was away. I believe that account was created by our moderator, redditisforsheep. So a round of applause for him for keeping the tourney going and running this great subreddit.

OK, I'm gonna give us a week for this one before the winner is officially announced, so hopefully everyone that visits this sub can check it out and vote.

***Instructions: I will post a comment with the person's name in CAPITAL LETTERS, along with who they are up against. So ""OMAR vs. Bodie"" is where you vote for Omar. ""BODIE vs. Omar"" is where you vote for Bodie. If you like that person over their competitor, give them an upvote. DOWNVOTES DO NOT COUNT. I can see the exact upvotes/downvotes so only upvotes will be counted. Voting will end at Midnight on 3/18, at which point the winner will be announced!***

Stringer runs up and and down and all around in every direction, like a Queen, before being boxed in by two inferiors pieces that are together more powerful.

&gt; Duquan -&gt; Bubbles

At the end we see him shooting up with his new employer, setting down the same path Bubbles likely did some time in his young life.

&gt; Michael -&gt; Omar

Perhaps the most obvious one. The shotgun was a little over the top.

&gt; Sydnor -&gt; McNulty

Inspired by the work of Freamon and McNulty, we see Sydnor appealing to that judge at the end in the same way McNulty did in the first season.

&gt; Marlo -&gt; Avon

Avon and Marlo are similar in their complete disinterest in honest business or politics. They are both soldiers for life and Marlo realizes this as he scares off the two corner boys in the last episode. From season 3 onward we see Marlo rise to power in the same way Avon likely did: leaving a trail of blood and not looking back.

&gt; Wee Bey and/or Chris -&gt; Dennis Wise (aka Cutty)

We see Dennis redeem himself by giving back to the community after a life of crime. Wee Bey was having similar revelations about his life when he spoke with Bunny and his wife. At the end we see Chris approach Wee Bey and they begin talking. This relationship could lead to a similar change of heart in Chris. We know he isn't completely cold hearted by his sympathy for Michael.

I tried Google, but there's too much bias floating around in the ether, so I thought, ""Why not ask other fans of The Wire? At least we have the *same* bias.""

This isn't just for me, I figure many people get a similar feeling; fighting that itch to just find S01E01 and start again. A friend of mine tried to find something else, and then just gave up and watched How I Met Your Mother.

Oh, and I've already watched Breaking Bad. I advise anyone else in this position to try that first. It's ace.

So my question is, what's the point of these references? As far as I can tell (and I'm not particularly insightful) I don't see a connection between the themes of season 3 and Simon's apparent criticism of the Iraq War.

(Spoilers for the whole series),LS_DJ,38,5,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1b4mrc/i_think_the_best_part_of_the_wire_were_the/,"This is really the biggest thing for me, especially when I discovered how deep these connections go. I find that most characters on both sides of the law have a doppleganger. Most notably:

- Stringer and Bunny Colvin. 

Both were majors in their particular organizations, not necessarily the top, but close. They had loyal followers and they understood the game, and both tried to change the game. String tried to legitimize himself through B&amp;B properties while still being in the game, and Colvin realized the futility of the standard methods of police work, and tried to change the game with Hamsterdam. When it came to a head...**you can't change the game**, and it cost Stringer his life and Colvin his Job. (Bunny tried to change the game again in S4 and the same thing happened, the game always wins) 

- Prop Joe and Commissioner Burrell

This one blew my mind in season 5, when Prop Joe takes Marlo to the lawyer and Herc is there. Prop. Joe reveals that he and Burrell knew each other in school. They were both the top of their respective areas, both the old guard in the game. They reveal this in the episode that Burrell is fired and Prop. Joe is killed, showing a changing of the old guard on both sides of the law.

- Omar and Bunk

They also knew each other when younger, and both respect eachother because they can recognize that each has a code. Bunk being a homicide detective and Omar being Omar, they are both connected by murder

- Bodie and Carver

Both are the grunt pawns who raise through the ranks, while both discovering that The Game is not fair. They both embrace Hamsterdam, and they both recognize that Marlo is a bad man. 

I'm sure there are more parallels that I haven't thought of, such as maybe Carcetti and Marlo? Kima and Snoop? Regardless, I find these parallels really hit home the major themes of The Wire and the fact that one of the major characters in the show is The Game itself

I figured I would share it with you guys once I got the grade back.

If anyone has listened to Dan Carlin’s Hardcore History podcasts, one has probably heard him sometime say that what makes a person great is that person being the right person for that situation at the right place and at the right time. When it comes to television, The Wire is the most literal representation of that definition. The confluence of experience that comes from the director and writer along with many actors cast from the neighborhood of Baltimore itself more than fits the definition of Dan Carlin’s great. This is a small reason of why The Wire is not only one of the greatest television dramas to ever exist, at least in America, but it is one of the purest forms of contemporary tragic theater. However, a foundation for this argument must exist. In this case Aristotle’s Poetics will be used as the support beam for the ideal form of tragedy.

Aristotle’s definition of tragedy states that it “is an imitation, through action rather than narration, of a serious, complete, and ample action, by means of language rendered pleasant at different places in the constituent parts by each of the aids used to make language more delightful, in which imitation there is also effected through pity and fear its catharsis of these and similar emotions.”

This is pretty straightforward, whereby Aristotle emphasizes that a tragedy must be a portrayal of action through language. In fact, this could be a definition of any serious drama, if one were to exclude the last part where he emphasizes pity, fear and the catharsis of similar emotions.

Catharsis, in his words once again, is “a purifying or figurative cleansing of the emotions; a release of emotional tension, as after an overwhelming experience, that restores or refreshes the spirit.”

Despite the ambiguity of this definition, in this essay, catharsis will be synonymous with vicariousness. Vicarious means, according to Merriam-Webster, “experienced or realized through imaginative or sympathetic participation in the experience of another”. Catharsis and vicarious both mean the same thing in that the audience member will feel the same emotion and almost live the same experience as the character that the actor is playing. Both words mean more than the standard audiovisual participation by the viewer, but an almost involuntary exercise in empathy that seems to be out of the audience member’s control. 

Aristotle then puts down a much more concrete list of what defines tragedy, in decreasing order of importance:

•	Plot (*mythos*)

•	Character (*ethos*)

•	Thought or Theme (*dianoia*)

•	Language or Diction (*lexis*)

•	Music (*melos*)

•	Spectacle (*opsis*)

Finally, there are the finer details of a tragedy:

*peripeteia* – A reversal of fortunes.

*hamartia* – “Tragic flaw” or the logical set of events that led to a character, or characters, downfall.

*anagnorisis* – When the character(s) realize their error or their own tragedies.
	
Starting the comparison with the easiest, and most objective, part of Aristotle’s definition of tragedy to compare, this being the list set out by Aristotle; The Wire’s plot is not only complex, but far reaching and interconnected. This is to say that, in terms of the socioeconomic ladder of today, the actions of the poorest heroin addict that wanders the streets can have a humongous effect that can affect the political titans of Baltimore. This is reminiscent to the Butterfly Effect seen in chaos theory where the smallest change in one area can lead to enormous shifts on the other end. What makes the plot of this show truly astounding is the entirely logical chain of events that displays this effect and how, when looking at each step from beginning to end, there is not a single point in it that leaves one questioning the causality of any action.

While doing this, The Wire seamlessly plays out the three fundamental aspects of Aristotle’s tragedy: *peripeteia*, *hamartia* and *anagnorisis*. Season 2, as only one example, of The Wire exemplifies all of the above. While it is hard to show the logical steps involved in reaching the conclusion without having watched both the first season and this one, the below Youtube videos, and commentary for clarification, show glimpses of the series while displaying the three attributes Aristotle listed.


http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gFzHvgdUYU

*Frank Sobotka (the balding gentleman with the ‘blue steel’) is clearly in firm control and with a definite plan in which to get the canals dredged. Note that the method in which Frank gets the money to lobby the Baltimore politicians are not only illegal, but is integral in his downfall.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISyyX1TpQCk

*A quick rundown of the history of the IBS union by a proud Frank.*

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-j5XWo1fPI

*Frank’s disgust at the current state of affairs and what he has to do to try and change them.*

These three scenes precisely show the inherent ‘tragic flaw’ in Frank and his initially hopeful state of affairs. He is always looking into the glory of the past with a sense of pride, justifiably, but is also attempting to bring this past glory into the incompatible times that he currently lives in. Frank’s rose-tinted glasses combined with the poor situation in his present situation, leads him to try and figuratively reverse time; directly leading to his own personal tragedy.

Throughout the whole season, the viewer can see Frank’s attempts at reviving the past fail more and more while everything seems to fall apart all around him. All the people that are related to him in the story seem to have their own tragedies, but his actions feed off of theirs and everyone's fates are completely intertwined.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkxYIHsmUQo

*Frank is talking to his son Ziggy in jail after Ziggy went through his own anagnorisis.*

This scene is touching not only because it shows the ultimate reversal of fortunes for Ziggy, with his complete lack of ignorance regarding his own downfall, but also because it is here that Frank reaches his moment of recognition. His own attempts to do well led for himself and his family directly to that moment in time with his son.

The above scenes hit all three of the major points that Aristotle considered as the most important part of a tragedy, but to make that claim that was made in the beginning about this show requires much more evidence to fit the definition of tragedy as a whole. 

While there is no single scene that can do justice to the dialogue of this show, but the scene below is a good introduction, literally and figuratively. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYgKmOJT_gM

*This is the very first scene of the entire show and displays the disparity in language between what is encountered everyday in a normal college campus and that of the urban environment in Baltimore.*

The scene is able to perfectly portray this dichotomy in language with the detective speaking in a dialect that is much more readily understood by the average viewer while the person he is talking to speaks not just with different terms, but with different grammar in general. This doesn’t even include the natural use of terminology used by policemen and politicians when speaking among their own circles. That kind of language distinction is seen throughout the whole series and is an important part in distinguishing this show from others by its very authenticity.

There are not many times in the show where music is played over the scene without that music being a part of the scene itself. However, at the end of each season though is a montage which shows some of the conclusions of that season while also showing the reality of Baltimore as it stood during the filming of it. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SO40ansNU8

*In the ending of that season, the music is played over these visuals so nicely that it is almost as if the city of Baltimore itself is singing this song’s lyrics: “Because I’ve been to hell and now I’m back again”.*

Regarding the least important of Aristotle’s list, there really is not much that is truly spectacular in the series. This is to say that the director does not go out of his way to show something flashy for its own sake. Every visual is done for a purpose, but there are also shots in the series that could stand as spectacles by themselves.

Yet, even if these few pieces of evidence shows the conformity of The Wire with Aristotle’s ideal tragedy, the experience of the show cannot be expressed in any other way than through watching it. Anyone interested in the show must take a gestalten approach and avoid trying to break it down into the show’s bare parts. There are so many facets, fine minutiae, themes and allegories that no single paper can ever give this show the value it deserves.

Having said that, one of the largest factors in why The Wire is such a great tragedy is that it is not a focus on any one character, but of an entire city. This city, made up of the people that inhabit it, is more than just the physical location of the show, but symbolic of the life of everyone watching the show. Each character in the show throws a light onto a different facet of Baltimore, with every tragedy coloring that light through the rise and fall of fortunes for that character. This ever changing spectrum of light is the way the world and life is. While every single person has their own tragedies with their own changing viewpoints corresponding to those tragedies, it is hard to visualize other people’s viewpoints and the way they those changes can directly affect other people.

What this show does is not only bring these tragedies of other people to surface, but it holds in its hand the mercurial truths of the world. The Wire is what it would look like if one were to capture an entire city’s population’s changing views at the same time. In this manner the *peripeteia*, *hamartia* and *anagnorisis* of each character are so interrelated that when one fortune falls, it cannot but bring about the rise or fall of another fortune. Perhaps the tragedy of The Wire is not the tragedy of the characters in the show, but the tragedy of the audience through the show’s acuity in such a painfully accurate portrayal of the zero-sum game of life.

Dukie with Prez. 

Randy with Carver.

Michael with Cutty.

Though admittedly Bunny does disparages the idea of academia at the close of the season, he nonetheless represents the University through his work within the school. 

Dukie as we know falls to the streets and the needle despite Prez's interventions, Randy is let down by the police system whilst Cutty is left in the hospital attempting to bring Michael off a corner. Perhaps the bitterest sense of injustice in the show is that Naymond is the only child who is better off at the end of the season than how he started it.

One of my favorite parts of the show was watching Michael, Namond, Randy, and Dukie being shaped into the characters they would become.

So it's pretty clear that by the end of the series Michael has ""inherited"" Omar's role while Dukie ends up becoming the new Bubbles.  This got me thinking that Namond and Randy also have to take up the mantle of certain characters.  The way I see it, Namond will become Clay Davis while Randy will become Officer Walker.

Namond is frequently described as being ""all talk"", having little to back up his words but ultimately being one of the luckiest characters in the show.  Clay Davis, meanwhile, is ""all talk"" in that he rarely follows through on promises to the various people from whom he basically steals money.  He is also pretty damn lucky, being a rich politician who fucks everyone over and ultimately gets no comeuppance.  He even mentions escaping the streets in his youth, much like Namond.  In one episode they are directly compared.  Namond tosses the flyers Randy was supposed to hand out, saying it was the flyer guy's fault for paying them in advance.  The same is later said about someone who paid Davis money in advance.  In his final appearance Namond is developing his public speaking skills, which is a huge part of Clay's success.  This leads me to wonder whether it was ultimately beneficial to get Namond off the street.  Had he stayed, he would certainly end up like D'Angelo, which would be sad.  But as is, he's being groomed into the successor to one of the most negative forces on the show.

Randy, meanwhile, already has the makings of a brutal police officer.  He's got reason to be extremely bitter towards the street kids who fucked him over, while he was shown to have a great  respect towards Carver.  We last see him growing into a violent bully in the group home, which could imply that he would become a gang enforcer, but it's unlikely he can get enough respect for that after snitching.  Ultimately he's a great candidate to put on a badge and use that as an excuse to brutalize the kind of kids who put his foster mother in the hospital.  Also, while Randy is one of the most likable and tragic characters on the show, Walker is one of the most hateful and unsympathetic ones.

1. has a central, powerful leader- Marlo Stanfield is the leader of the Stanfield crew and eventually, the Co op.

2. terror mechanism, people are always being watched- everyone is scared to be even seen with the cops or they can dissapear. It eventually gets Little Kev and Boadie killed.

3. military controlled by the leader- Marlo has control of Snoop and Chris, the muscle.

4. control of the economy- Marlo bought the connect so everyone has to go through him to get the package.

5. no opposition to the leader- Marlo kills Prop Joe and Skinny Man. Everyone knows it but no one is willing to call him out on it out of fear.

6. charismatic leader- Marlo is one charismatic mofo.

7. propaganda- in the start of season 4, Marlo goes around giving money to the kids to go buy school clothes so he can show who owns the streets now.

8. control of the legal system- he can buy in-court information from Levy.

9. extreme nationalism- the co op started as they wanted to stop dealing with them New York boys. Eventually, Marlo steps up to kill those who comes down to send them a message.

No big surprises yesterday, as just about every character handled their business.

* (1) Stringer Bell defeated (16) Fruit 164-4
* (8) Landsman defeated (9) Nicky Sobotka 80-73
* (5) Snoop defeated (12) Waylon 120-39
* (4) Wee-Bey defeated (13) Burrell 141-16
* (6) Carver defeated (11) Pearlman 126-22
* (3) D'Angelo defeated (14) Agent Fitzhugh 139-10
* (7) Kima defeated (10) Norman Wilson 85-62
* (2) Freamon defeated (15) Orlando 163-4

OK, now we get into the second round. The winners of these matchups move on to the Sweet Sixteen. I'm gonna leave this up slightly longer because these matchups will likely be closer and I want to ensure everyone gets a chance to vote.

In the first half of second round voting, we have:

* (1) Omar vs. (8) Poot
* (4) Marlo vs. (5) Prez
* (3) Cutty vs. (6) Wallace
* (2) Slim Charles vs. (7) Frank Sobotka
* 
* (1) Stringer vs. (8) Landsman
* (4) Wee-Bey vs. (5) Snoop
* (3) D'Angelo vs. (6) Carver
* (2) Freamon vs. (7) Kima

***Instructions: I will post a comment with the person's name in CAPITAL LETTERS, along with who they are up against. So ""FRANK SOBOTKA vs. Slim Charles"" is where you vote for Frank. ""SLIM CHARLES vs. Frank Sobotka"" is where you vote for Slim Charles. If you like that person over their competitor, give them an upvote. DOWNVOTES DO NOT COUNT. I can see the exact upvotes/downvotes so only upvotes will be counted. Voting will end at Midnight on 3/14, at which point we'll move onto the next round.***

Also, half the fun in this is arguing for/against each character. If you feel passionate about someone, write up why you think they should win and post it.

I've never felt so defeated and empty after watching a television series.  'The Shield', 'Breaking Bad', 'Six Feet Under' and 'Dexter' have their share of crushing, shocking or depressing moments, but something about 'The Wire' has left me feeling like something had happened to me *personally*.  I felt it at the end of Season 1, and I feel it even more at the end of Season 2...the feeling is defeat.  I feel like I lost.  We watched Frank cheat and steal in order to protect his union, his family and those that he cared about.  He never meant to hurt anyone and he truly had his heart in the right place, but his mistakes still caught up with him.  Frank's biggest mistake, however, may be that he spent more time taking care of his workers and his nephew than he did his own son.  Yeah, Ziggy was a wreckless asshole, but he's also someone that needed a father to look after him and teach him right from wrong.  
  
Witnessing the end of the union, Ziggy's meltdown and finally, seeing what happened to Frank- all while Valcek and The Greek continue to prevail...I just felt sick to my stomach.  As the box of evidence was closed, and the girls were loaded off another truck, my heart sank.  
  
I was warned.  I was told that The Wire was crushing.  I've already been told not to expect the series to end even remotely happy.  I've been told to expect the worst characters to prevail while the likable characters crash and burn.  
  
I'm not being critical though.  All of this negativity is testament to the brilliant writing behind this show- good writing makes me love characters that want to hate, makes you feel heartbreak when they fail.  ...but will I always feel this defeated and disgusted after a season ends?

It feels so much more ""real"" than most of the shows I've watched where the plot was beaten over my head. In this show, an emotional moment for a character isn't highlighted with a song, and it doesn't show them for ten minutes so that even the slowest audience member can understand what they're supposed to feel. It's a fleeting moment, like seeing D'Angelo suppress a smile when he thinks that Wallace has escaped the game for a better life. Watching Carver slowly become more and more annoyed with Herc's immature fratboy attitude towards doing police work. An example of the realistic character psychology is watching him embrace the humor again when they're detailed together in season two, and then watching him quickly become annoyed as he sees that Herc hasn't changed one bit. 

Watching Stringer try to stimulate intellectual discourse amongst his crew that he's stolen control of from Avon. Watching him attempt to look intelligent after his community college Economics courses. 

It feels less like some of the characters are more ""main"" and fleshed out, than it does that each character is just as deep and complex as the next. The minor character on the corner is no more shallow than McNulty's motivations for committing to dirty police work.

My opinion is that due to Generation Kill's less ambitious premise and shorter length it actually manages to be a more solid package than The Wire.

The series follows the MO of David Simon, being made for the people portrayed in it(even featuring one marine playing as himself) and showing the dysfunction in modern institutions. But I think the real genius of the show comes from the probably unintended consequences of this. The show tries to honestly portray soldiers in the situation of war, but the problem with trying to do that is that soldiers are people pushed to be as inhumane as possible and war is the most inhumane situation possible.

The result is a monstrosity. There is no way to distance yourself from it through stories of heroes and bad people, because of the show's focus on the soldiers you'll have a hard time distancing yourself from the horrifying reality on the ground by delving into the realm of ideology and politics. What is portrayed is just people doing a job for an institution that suffers from the same dysfunctions as all our institutions, people that at times you might consider assholes, sometimes funny, sometimes relatable, but mainly just people performing a work which happens to be mass killing.

That's the problem though, we're not really supposed to be aware of this. How can we reconcile our everyday morality with living in a system that seems to require mass killing in order to function? Because that is what you're left with in Generation Kill, after all the politics have been removed there remains just workers fulfilling their role in a global system by massacring people. I said that this might be unintentional but David Simon probably did have some kind of understanding of it because the show ends [with the soldiers who for the whole duration of the show had just been waiting to do their work then decide to watch some footage of their work that they recorded and slowly start to turn away ignoring the footage, which seems like the only way available to us to deal with the reality we face](/spoiler).

There's many more aspects to Generation Kill but this aspect of how horrified by it you ought to be just seemed the most striking to me at the moment. There's no subreddit for Generation Kill so I decided to show my appreciation for the series here.",,False,self,t5_2reco,False,,,True,t3_1c2u66,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/1c2u66/generation_kill/,

Generally, much of the dislike tends to derive from the McNulty fake serial killer plot thread, which many regard as unrealistic and sensationalised. Throughout seasons 1 - 4, up until this point, The Wire has been laying down the groundwork to show us why a scenario such as 'McNulty's Serial Killer' is entirely plausible. The key missing ingredient in Baltimore that makes the story plausible is a fact check. All of the stakeholders involved with McNulty's Serial Killer are looking to make capital ahead of anything else. In the case of McNulty and Freamon, they're using the homeless to make policing capital by catching Marlo Stanfield, Templeton is using the homeless to make journalistic capital by writing a Pulitzer-winning article, Carcetti is using the homeless to make political capital and heighten his public image, all the while failing to address the issues that brought about homelessness in the first place. Fact checking McNulty's creation would do nothing but reduce the likelihood of exploiting capital from the situation, and thus would not be in the interests of anyone involved. 

It is this 'perfect storm' of interests that makes the Serial Killer Story last until it dies (not with a fact check, but with Kima snitching), and provides all the groundwork in terms of realism. Whilst many viewers may dismiss parts of Season 5 as 'overly-sensational' compared to the others, when I considered all the characters’ motivations Season 5 seemed just as real as, and a natural extension of, what came before it. Believing that Freamon would team up with McNulty in an instant was perhaps the only leap of faith for me.

Season 3’s Hamsterdam plot on the other hand continually goes unnoticed for a long period of time. In terms of realism, this is far below what Season 5 showed us. Weeks upon weeks of three separate city blocks close to Downtown Baltimore going unnoticed by the rest of the city and its media seems to be a bit of a stretch for me.

Anyway, those are just my thoughts on why I feel Season 5 deserves to be cut a little bit of slack.

First off, Carcetti was one of my favorite characters through the series. But when I see people talk about the finale of the Wire, people talk about Carcetti in a negative light, especially in terms of becoming governor. 

I thought that Carcetti did about the best he could. He was dealt a shit hand (the school budget problems), and still managed to reform some things. (getting better police, getting rid of Burrell, cleaning up parts of the city, gunning for Clay Davis)

The only negative things I thought he really did were walking away from the money the governor was offering and cutting the police budget as badly as he did. Then, of course, he up and left to become governor. 

But wasn't Carcetti still a ""good"" character? (as far as the Wire is concerned) I didn't think he was corrupted or gave up or became as bad as Royce or anyone.

Yes it lacks the ""luster"" of the drug game, but it was this season that I knew The Wire was going to be great. Why? 

This is where it showed me that it was willing to take on the heady, larger issues. How many shows just focus on ""the streets"" but never go beyond that. Where are the drugs coming in? How does this happen and so on. Yes the game is interesting but that is just a small bit of a vicious cycle that extends into every facet of our lives (politics, education, work, our homes and in our papers). This season begins to show that.

For me The Wire is great at ""connecting the dots"" and this was the season that they started to bring you out of ""this is a cop drama"" and into an expose of Baltimore.

1) **Omar Devone Little** (Indeed.)

2) **Bubbles** (Such an amazing performance, and singularly tells the tale of how drugs have destroyed large parts of many American cities.)

3) **The Bunk** (Honestly the funniest character in the whole series, mainly because of how brilliantly he is played)

4) **Cutty** (""Wise. Dennis Wise."" Love his tale of redemption, how he struggles to reinsert into society, and his calm, steady demeanor)

5) **Slim Charles** (Always real, loyal, and keeps his head down. Plays the game better than anyone else in my opinion.)

**Honorable Mentions:**

Bill Rawls (such a brilliant asshole, so well played. ""Democracy in action. Let's show those 3rd world fucks how it's done.""), Frank Sobotka, Wee-Bey, Chris Partlow, Prop Joe, Michael Lee


Least Favorites:

1) **Scott Templeton** (The opposite of Omar, and fakest character in the entire series. Fucking kills me he makes it out on top.)

2) **Kenard** (He's pretty funny being the most foulmouthed character in the series... but he was gonna light a cat on fire and then took down the most badass tiger in the concrete jungle. Fuck you Kenard.)

3) **Maurice Levy** (Lowest morals of any character, and does so much bad for the City. Love how Omar takes it to him. ""I got the shotgun, you got the briefcase... s'all in the game though, right?"")

4) **Valchek** (Holy hell is this little rat annoying. Just pestering, plotting, and constantly being a dick in that horrible voice of his.)

5) **Ziggy Sobotka** (He isn't that horrible, kinda makes you feel bad for the guy. However, he is annoying as all hell.)
 
What say you, Wireheads?

**EDIT:** These have been awesome responses. Definitely made me think of some on both sides that should be mentioned, especially in the ""least favorite"" category.

Obviously this gets explored a bit with, say, Carver's character development, but I'd say there would be scope for a lot more; we know how characters like Valchek and Burrell rise to positions of power despite not being very good policemen, but how do they start out?

Aaaannddd we're back. I left the third region up over the weekend because I don't think quite as many people check reddit on the weekend as they do on weekdays. Between Saturday and Sunday we got about the same number of votes as the Thursday/Friday posts did.

But the bigger news is that we had our first major upset of the tournament. I woke up in a cold sweat wondering if I had accidentally transposed the figures, but nope, they're accurate: Augustus ""Gus"" Haynes officially put an end to the bow-tied Brother Mouzone in a first-round shocker. Some impassioned pleas from Gus fans combined with a backlash against Mouzone's somewhat unrealistic characterization sealed the deal.

* (1) Bubbles defeated (16) Brianna Barksdale 129-10
* (8) Randy defeated (9) Cheese 86-37
* (12) Gus Haynes defeated (5) Brother Mouzone 67-65 UPSET ALERT

* (7) Dukie defeated (10) Namond 90-38

We now move on to the final region of the first round. Gus is undoubtedly the Cinderella of the tournament thus far, but can another minor character survive to the second round? A few might have a shot.

---
The title refers to Detective Jimmy McNulty setting his sights on Stringer Bell and Avon Barksdale's drug dealing organization as the target of an investigation.

**Epigraph**
---
“ 	...when it's not your turn... – McNulty 	”

McNulty chiding his partner Bunk for answering the phone and catching a case unlikely to go black, when it wasn't their turn.

---
My own episode summary
---
I never thought about how much actually goes on in an episode of The Wire. It is pretty complex, which is probably what turns off people who don't give The Wire enough of a chance. But it's very difficult summarise an episode and do it justice in a couple of lines or even a few paragraphs.

I have to admit to being confused with some of the names the first time around, among the street characters and in homicide. I was watching it somewhere with no internet access, so I couldn't check wikipedia, but all the same,I can think of worse things than being stuck with a DVD of The Wire for entertainment.

So much stuff going on. I thought a summary of the main points would encourage some debate...

---
- Snot Boogie is shot and McNulty gets a witness to open up, who provides one of the quotes of the episode and one of my favourites.

        McNulty:-
        If Snot Boogie always stole the money, why'd you let him play?
        Witness:-
        Got to... this America man.

---
- Stringer Bell and associates successfully intimidate state's witness, William Gant, a witness in D'Angelo Barksdale's trial for murder, where they also pay off another witness to muddy the waters by recanting her original recollection of the murder, while McNulty looks on as an interested spectator.

---
- McNulty stirs up his first hornet's nest, after he gives the judge presiding over the D'Angelo Barksdale case the lay of the land on the street, in the towers and low-rises, and what's going on in his own courtroom under his nose.

---
- We see our first street rip, carried out by Kima, Carver and Herc, as Kima shows up her two colleagues even though she is the junior detective.

---
- It's the new millennium and we are given a glimpse of the ""high-tech"" equipment they have available to write up the street rip.


---
- Carver makes a succinct observation regarding the ""war"" on drugs.

        Kima Greggs:-
        Fighting the war on drugs... one brutality case at a time.
        Carver:-
        Girl, you can't even call this shit a war...
        Herc:-
        Why not?
        Carver:-
        Wars end...

---
- Bunk gives a fuck, ""when it ain't his turn to give a fuck"" and catches a dead-end case. Not the last time we hear that phrase.

---
- Major Rawls introduces McNulty to his two middle fingers for the first time and afterwards is given a piece of prophetic advice by his sergeant, Jay Landsman, about riding the boat.

---
- D'Angelo gets busted down to the low-rises as punishment for getting himself charged with murder.

---
- Bubbles pulls his money scam.

        D'Angelo:-
        This look like money, motherfucker? Money be green! Money feel like money...
        That shit look green to you?

---
- Bubbles gives some sage advice to his partner in crime, Johnny Weeks...

        Bubbles:-
        I'm tryin' give you a little game, but you wanna pretend you know somethin'...
        Johnny:-
        Yo, I know a lot Bubbs.
        Bubbles:-
        Naah... naah... you green... I'm tryin to get you brown man... but you still green.

---
- The ball is set rolling on Daniels' detail and the Deputy Ops makes it clear to him what he expects of him and the detail.

---
- McNulty visits his FBI buddy, Fitzhugh, in the Baltimore Field Office and we see the contrast between the resources available to the FBI and the local police. Kima was shown typing up case documents on a typewriter, while the FBI are capable of obtaining and remotely monitoring a live video feed of a package being vialed up in a house in Pimlico.

---
- Fitzhugh also mentions the FBI getting out of drugs and concentrating on terrorism. Despite the fact that the episode was filmed only a couple of weeks after 9/11, the writers predicted the response and shifted emphasis of the bureau.

---
- Johnny shows that he is still green, screwing up Bubbles' money scam. He suffers the consequences as Bodie, Poot and Wallace give Johnny what they consider retribution, resulting him being beaten to within an inch of his life and needing a colostomy bag when he recovers and Bubbles seeking out Kima, in an attempt to see Johnny's attackers get what they deserve.

---
- The first few recruits to the Avon Barksdale detail are brought together for the first time and McNulty is put in his place by Daniels after protesting the way in which the investigation will be carried out.

---
- McNulty exhibits some remorse for back-dooring the department, while having a drink with Bunk, but likely only due the personal consequences.

        McNulty:-
        I feel like that motherfucker at the end of The Bridge On The River Kwai, you know...
        What the fuck did I do...

1360754443.0,22,self.TheWire,18fueh,Let's talk about Frank Sobotka (mostly season 2 but possible other SPOILERS),moxiedrinker82,30,8,38,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheWire/comments/18fueh/lets_talk_about_frank_sobotka_mostly_season_2_but/,"I've seen people say this is [the most important scene of ""The Wire""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=fvwp&amp;v=lvTTt_VvffQ&amp;NR=1) and a lot of people have various thoughts/feelings regarding that. I find that notion a little curious and confusing. (This is kind of me thinking out loud, but would love to get some feedback from more educated (ie - familiar with the show) peers)

Just to get this out of the way: The main antagonists/players in the series are Avon, Stringer and Marlo (if you're looking at a Police vs Organization conflict). Going into season two I thought ""Wait, where'd all the drug stuff go? What's this union labor stuff? I don't know any of these people..."" and after seeing the entire series I better understand why the union was covered but I felt like Sobotka was kind of a filler position. They needed someone in charge, they had Sobotka. I wouldn't say Sobotka was a throw-away character just there to serve the story, especially if this is the most important scene of the series. Also, aside from D'angelo, his mother and Avon, there weren't too many families represented on the other side of the law. (Michael has his brother, Cheese is Prop Joe's nephew, etc but Frank, Nick and Ziggy maintained more of that familial vibe/bond. This is probably a direct parallel to how Frank is the pater familias to the dock's longshoremen population ([took that directly from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Sobotka).)

Here's where discussion gets a little tricky: Avon, Stringer and Marlo were all intelligent, each in their own ways. Sobotka was a different kind of intelligent. The scene I linked earlier shows that he knows the laws and exactly how far they reach but he also knows his own rights and that he doesn't have to respond to Bunk and Beadie. Where Avon, Stringer and Marlo had street smarts and knew the game, they had more of a defensive ""don't get caught"" mentality. Their intelligence was based on how to stay out of jail and get more money. Sobotka started out as an honest worker. Along the way he started allowing things to happen at the docks (based on lack of work for his crew, he needed to provide for his guys) but I believe he felt he was doing the right thing, or at least doing the wrong thing for the right reasons. I don't think he ever considered himself a villain. (That may be why this is the most important scene, because all of us are capable of making the wrong choice, even if we tell ourselves it's for the right reasons, and losing sight of our morals and standards.) There is also a racial aspect to this, which may spark some heated debate. While Avon, Stringer and Marlo are more prominent villains throughout the series, they know the game and they happen to be black. (I don't say ""African American because a guy I know from Tennessee says ""I'm black. I've never been to Africa. I'm American."" So...let's skip the PC debate.) Sobotka appears to be an intelligent guy (possibly educated, though not too highly) trying to work an honest job, which he takes pride in. He happens to be white. (The racial implication of a white man working an ""honest"" job and the black members of society running drugs...this is where the debate comes in, but I'm not sure there's too much there.)

I don't have a proper way to wrap this all up, these are just some things I've been thinking about. Would love to hear your feedback.

**EDIT/Clarification:** When I say ""villain"" I don't mean sinister doer of evil, I just mean in a legal perspective someone who functions outside the law. The detail is tasked with finding these sorts of people, making cases against them. I guess target would be a better term.

It's probably because of his quiet, supreme self-confidence and his extreme demand for respect. The ""my name is my name!"" scene might be my favorite in the series because it's the first time we see him lose his calm, show much emotion, and reveal what I think is his driving motive: respect. 

While String might be in it for the money and legitimacy, Avon wants to maintain a respectable street business to stay comfortable, and Omar's just trying to get by within his own code and retire comfortably, Marlo's number 1 motive, IMO, is personal respect. Of all of The Wire's main characters, Marlo takes the biggest slight to insults on his personal image, his name. Maybe it's really a sign of deep insecurity, but Marlo's main goal doesn't seem to be money or even power but for an unfaltering awe of his persona.

The other is the miss on Omar Little [death](/spoiler). No one told the great story behind him.

Here are the results from yesterday's voting:

* (1) Omar defeats (16) Little Kevin 124-3
* (8) Poot defeats (9) Herc 57-54
* (5) Prez defeats (12) Valchek 106-9
* (4) Marlo defeats (13) Sergei 91-17
* (6) Wallace defeats (11) Rawls 63-60
* (3) Cutty defeats (14) Royce 105-7
* (7) Frank Sobotka defeats (10) Sydnor 82-32
* (2) Slim Charles defeats (15) White Mike 112-2

No upsets on the first day, though Rawls was a cunt-hair away from knocking off Wallace. Poot and Herc were dead even for much of the day, but Poot pulled away slightly at the end and the two dealers from the pit managed to knock off the white police. 

A new round of voting today, and I can't say I see any upsets occurring here, but who knows. 

* (1) Bodie vs. (16) Johnny Weeks
* (8) The Greek vs. (9) Butchie
* (5) Daniels vs. (12) Beadie
* (4) Prop Joe vs. (13) The Deacon
* (6) Chris Partlow vs. (11) Spiros Vondas
* (3) Bunny Colvin vs. (14) Kenard
* (7) Carcetti vs. (10) Ziggy Sobotka
* (2) Bunk vs. (15) Alma Gutierrez

***Instructions: I will post a comment with the person's name in CAPITAL LETTERS, along with who they are up against. So ""BODIE vs. Johnny Weeks"" is where you vote for Bodie. ""JOHNNY WEEKS vs. Bodie"" is where you vote for Johnny. If you like that person over their competitor, give them an upvote. DOWNVOTES DO NOT COUNT. I can see the exact upvotes/downvotes so only upvotes will be counted. Voting will end at Midnight tonight, at which point we'll move onto the next round.***

Also, half the fun in this is arguing for/against each character. If you feel passionate about someone, write up why you think they should win and post it.

Herc ended up confessing he'd sleep with some professional baseball catcher to sleep with the Olsen sisters and I think Dozerman's  girlfriend (lmao). Carver at first was nonchalant about it, played it cool. Then afterwards Carver told everybody and Herc got ripped for it, funny stuff.

Anyways, when Herc ended up working as a bodyguard, he and his partner were checking out a hot secretary. His partner said, ""damn, I'd sleep with you to sleep with her"".
