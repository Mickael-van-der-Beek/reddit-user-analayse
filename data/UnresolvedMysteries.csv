In the late 1990s a then-reporter named Bryan Hance working for the Wildcat noticed weird ads posted in the paper... a full-page one on May 1st, but smaller ads posted around the year.

Bryan started looking into past editions, and found ads going back to 1981. They may have even gone back later. He started a website to scan the ads, and let other interested folks have a go at trying to ""crack"" them.

That's when things got weird. The ""freaks"" and the ""orphanage"" began to communicate directly with Bryan. They would mail him notes, send packages, email him. Bryan documented it all on the website, and a community of folks would try to analyze the texts, ads, emails, etc and post their ideas. Bryan has long since graduated and moved away, but he still keeps up the website as much as he can.

A couple things to note: this isn't Bryan doing this. He would have been an infant or not even born when they starts. Whoever is doing this, they've been at it for over 30 years (I just heard from someone else the ads started in the 1970s, making it 40+ years).

They've got $$$. It's expensive to take out a full-page ad in the Wildcat.

They've traced the person who posts the ads to a lawyer here in Tucson. All he says is he is an intermediary for the parties.

I suggest reading the ""Mystery"" background page first, then going to the texts page to see images of the ads. I'll try to get some ads on Imgur too for easy ""intro"" viewing.

I've been following this since my grad school days in the early 2000's, and this is the first year they haven't posted an ad on Mayday (they emailed an explanation to Bryan). 

I would love to finally see this mystery cracked, and I think if anyone can do it it's reddit. Please share this with any mystery-lover who has a knack for this sort of thing. I think this is the type of thing Reddit would love, if word could get out about it.

If we can get interest going, I'll create a subreddit for ideas. We also have a Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/groups/77471293287/

1369918981.0,281,self.UnresolvedMysteries,1fc0sc,Ohio College Student Disappears in 1953. Strange Events and Theories Follow.,ThroneofGames,332,51,49,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1fc0sc/ohio_college_student_disappears_in_1953_strange/,"*I'm hoping that this is a new one to many of you. An Ohioan, I first read about this as a kid in the mid 90's as one story of many within the first installment of a book series called ""Haunted Ohio"" by Chris Woodyard. But don't let the title of the book turn you off from the case as it is eerie enough on its own without inserting any supernatural malarkey into the mix.*


**Ronald Tammen** was a well-liked 19 year old college sophomore with an extensive resume of extracurriculars. He was a varsity wrestler, Dean's List Student, Navy ROTC member, frat brother, dorm RA, and a bassist for a popular jazz band. The college was Ohio's Miami University (not to be confused with Florida's more famous University of Miami). 


**Tammen had been studying for an exam with a friend** one door down in the dorms when he returned to his own room to study for a different exam. Not much later, his roommate returned to find his friend Ronald gone. The lights and radio were still on, an open book lay on the desk, and Ron's wallet and some other personal items were there as well. This wouldn't seem too strange if not for the fact that his coat was also still in its place even though it was a frigid and snowy April evening. The next morning, when he still had not returned, the roommate reported him missing. Tammen's car was found in its usual spot, locked, and with his bass in the back. 


**The search that ensued** was pretty thorough. His fraternity brothers, and 400 ROTC members were joined by the local police, the state highway patrol, and later, the FBI. The woods nearby were searched, a cistern on campus was drained, and even a state park 5 miles away was checked. No trace was found. 


**The following summer**, the first possible lead in the case emerged. A woman living in a house about 12 miles away from campus came forward and claimed she had answered a late-night knock on her door the same evening Tammen had disappeared. A seemingly confused but polite young man matching Ron's description inquired about where he could catch a bus. He appeared disheveled and was wearing only a t-shirt and jeans despite the low temperature. She pointed him in the direction of the nearest bus stop and he went on his way. It later came to light that the bus line had actually been suspended that night, so whoever the man was never would have caught one.


*(Note: The following events are quoted from ""Haunted Ohio"". They do not appear in the article I'm linking so I'm assuming the authorities didn't believe there to be a connection with the disappearance, but apparently the student witnesses and the author thought there MAY be and it was included in the story. I thought it was at least worth sharing. A link to the book's amazon.com listing is included at the bottom.)*


**""The following fall the students were startled by a voice singing--first in a bass voice, then in falsetto--in the formal gardens and from the woods. For the next two nights the voice tantalized students, apparently approaching the dorm from the direction of the gardens, then fading back into the woods. The second night, two students claimed to see a long-haired figure striding into the dark. The third night, a group of counselors heard the voice and gave chase across the golf course. On the fifth night a tall figure in a long black coat was chased and lost in a wooded ravine.""**


The long hair part is what intrigues me most about those encounters. I don't think long hair was very commonly worn by men in the early 1950's. Was it a person who had been living off the grid for some time?


**A wide range of theories** have been proposed to explain Tammen's disappearance. Some examples are foul play and/or amnesia, dodging the Korean War OR actually running away to JOIN the war effort, fraternity prank gone wrong, and perhaps the wildest theory is that he was recruited by the CIA.


The case remains unsolved six decades later.

The Monster poisoned several confectionery items across Japan, belonging to different companies.

Letters were sent taunting the police and warning ""Moms of the nation"" about the dangers of buying the sweet companies' products.

The police superintendent eventually committed suicide over the case, and the Monster sent a final message to the media stating that they had stopped lacing products with cyanide. They were never heard from again, and nobody was ever convicted.

It is believed that the Monster was caught on camera, however the man in the recording was never found.

Police attempted to capture the Monster during an exchange of 50m Yen, however the suspect managed to evade the police twice and was not seen again.

She was arrested on November 17th and that's the last that anybody had heard from her. In a city as populated as Toronto, there has to be somebody that knows something and isn't fessing up. 


Why aren't the police treating this like a homicide? Why isn't it being taken seriously?

The problem is that the hole keeps flooding, leading some to believe it could just be a sinkhole. But some others claim enough evidence has been found to conclude that the pit is man-made and that the flooding is the intention of the builders and is a defense mechanism for their treasure. 

Some things they have found in the pit so far include oak platforms (reportedly man-made with tool marks), charcoal, coconut fiber (once used by ships for protecting valuables) and a stone with the inscription: ""Forty Feet Below, Two Million Pounds Are Buried.""

Still, no one really knows the true nature of the Oak Island ""Money Pit"" but a company from Michigan recently bought the rights to dig there, so we'll see if they can't finally solve this conundrum for us.

Hey all, I regularly visit this subreddit so I thought I'd contribute this post about a haunting disappearance: [Jennifer Kesse](http://media.amw.com/multimedia/fileRepository/db/472/116/ab_enlarge.jpg), then 24, [vanished into thin air](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Jennifer_Kesse) from her apartment complex in Orlando, Florida on January 24, 2006. 

Jennifer had always been very safety-conscious; she carried a whistle and mace and was known to ""check in"" via phone calls to let family know she had reached destinations safely.

Jennifer usually left her apartment for work between 7:30 and 7:45. Her boyfriend had a meeting that morning, but he called her when it was over (10ish) and the phone went straight to voicemail, which he found slightly unusual, as she always left her phone on. Around 11AM, her employers, growing concerned over her absence and their inability to reach her, contacted her parents, who in turn contacted her boyfriend. 

Meanwhile, around noon, an unknown person parked her car in a different apartment complex about a mile away from hers. [Surveillance footage](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUwhUPGXeUE) captured the man parking the car and walking away from it, but the images of him are not clear.

Jennifer's family entered her apartment that afternoon and found no signs of struggle; everything looked normal. Her car was finally found two days later. Again, no signs of struggle in it. The level of gas in the tank suggested that the car had not been driven any unusual distances. Her wallet, keys, phone, and driver's license have never been found. There was a DVD player in the backseat -- her own. No one knows why it was there, and nobody has ever found out what happened to her.

48 Hours did a piece about her (in conjunction with Tara Grinstead) which you can [watch here](http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=4713050n).

As recently as 2008, Gannon and Duarte were examining evidence[1] going back to the late 1990s that they believe connects the deaths of 40 or more college-age males, whose dead bodies were found in water in 11 states, often after leaving parties or bars where they were drinking. The men, according to the former detectives, often fit a profile of being popular, athletic, and good students, and most were white.[2]
Gannon and Duarte have theorized that the young men were all murdered, either by an individual or by an organized group of killers.[2][3] The term smiley face became connected to the alleged murders when it was made public that Gannon and Duarte had discovered graffiti depicting a smiley face near locations where they think the killer dumped the bodies in at least a dozen of the cases.

From time to time he talks about ""them"" who want to hurt or kill him but never says who ""they"" are. On the 25th of October 1984, around 11pm, while his wife is present, he suddenly stands up from his chair and says: ""Jetzt geht mir ein Licht auf!""(germ. ""I got it!""/""Now I understand!"") and writes down YOGTZE(the G might be a 6) and leaves.

Later that night he shows up in his favourite pub in Wilnsdorf. He orders a beer but suddenly falls from his chair and hurts his face. Witnesses say that he was not drunk at this time.
He leaves immediately after and shows up at 1 am in Haigerseelbach where he grew up and knocked at the door of an old lady who was his former neighbour. She was known for her religiosity and he was eager to come in and have a talk with her. According to her he was talking about ""horrible incidents which will take place tonight"". At the end she didn't let him in because it was 1 am and he seemed confused.

Until here it sounds like just another guy with paranoia but here is where it gets interesting:

At 3 am two truck driver find Stoll's damaged car in the roadside ditch of the Autobahn 45 near Hagen-Süd. Both witnessed that they saw four men, in bright clothes, walking around the wreck. They stopped, stepped out of their truck and headed to the emergency telephone nearby, at the side of the road, to call for help. After that they walked over to the wreck and found Stoll in his car, he was naked and heavily injure but conscious. He said that there used to be other men with him in the car but that they hit the road. He died in the ambulance on his way to the hospital.

The police later found out that the deadly injury was not caused by the accident but that someone had driven over him, while he was already naked, and later put him into his car.

Till this day no one knows what really happened that night and what the meaning of YOGTZE is.

http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~nelson/courses/cryptology/phaistos_disk/phaistos_disk.html

The Phaistos Disc was discovered by Italian archaeologist Luigi Pernier in the Minoan palace-site of Phaistos on the south coast of Crete in 1908; specifically the disc was found in the basement of room 8 in building 101 of a group of buildings to the northeast of the main palace.

It is about 15 cm (5.9 in) in diameter and covered on both sides with a spiral of stamped symbols that are unlike any signs in any writing system. There are 241 tokens on the disc, comprising 45 unique signs. Many of these 45 signs represent easily identifiable every-day things, such a marching man, an arrow, a beehive. However, attempting to interpret them literally does not lead to any obvious decipherment of the disc. Speculation has thus arisen that the pictograms are somehow being used phonetically, perhaps in a manner similar to Egyptian hieroglyphics.

In addition to these signs, there is a small diagonal line that occurs underneath the final sign in a group a total of 18 times.

The German typesetter and linguist Herbert Brekle argues that the disc is an early document of movable type printing, since the symbols were impressed using a set of stamps rather than being hand-engraved. This suggests a facility for large-scale production of printed material; however, no other samples of the script have ever been found.

The disc's purpose and meaning, and even its original geographical place of manufacture, remain disputed, making it one of the most famous mysteries of archaeology.",,False,,t5_2wvvc,False,,,True,t3_1fiy6h,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1fiy6h/the_phaistos_disc/,

Joseph Daniel Casolaro was an American freelance writer who was found dead in a bathtub in a Hotel in Martinsburg, West Virginia. His wrists slashed 10–12 times. A note was found, and the medical examiner ruled the death a suicide. However, his notes suggested he was in Martinsburg to meet a source about a story he called ""the Octopus"", which centered around a sprawling collaboration involving an international cabal and featuring a number of stories in and near Washington, D.C. in the 1980s (eg, [the Inslaw case](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inslaw), [the October Surprise theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_surprise_conspiracy_theory), the [the Bank of Credit and Commerce International collapse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International), and [Iran-Contra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran-Contra)). Before Casolaro left for Martinsburg, he had told his brother that he had been frequently receiving harassing phone call threats late at night and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. He had a well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and his family found it incomprehensible that if he were going to commit suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times.

At 7:30 PM on February 9th, 2004, Maura Murray drove her vehicle off a highway in New Hampshire. A passing bus driver found her and asked if she needed help, she refused, stating that she'd already called AAA (AAA later reported no call had been received). A neighbor called the police to report the accident, but when the police arrived about 15 minutes later, Maura was gone and hasn't been seen since.

Earlier on the day of the disappearance, Maura made calls asking for information about a condo in Bartlett, New Hampshire, another call for information about Stowe, Vermont, and a third call to her boyfriend that lasted only a minute. She also used MapQuest to get directions to Burlington, Vermont.

From Wikipedia:

""Reported Sightings:

* Monday, February 9, 2004. 8:00 - 8:30 PM - A Swiftwater, New Hampshire local reportedly saw a young person moving quickly on foot eastbound on Route 112, about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km) east of where Maura's vehicle was discovered. The young person was reported to have been wearing jeans, a dark coat, and a light-colored hood. The witness reported that the person, upon being seen, quickly ran down a side dirt road.

* June 2005. A girl with blonde hair resembling Maura was seen at a church in Barton, Vermont. A witness said that the girl said her name was ""Raykel"" and took off quickly when the minister started a Father's Day sermon.

* June 2006. A girl resembling Maura was seen at a Cumberland Farms store in Hillsborough, New Hampshire with an older male companion. The girl was reportedly mouthing ""help me."" There are no security tapes of the incident available. The sighting was not reported until a few months later when the witness saw photos of Maura on a television news program.

In October 2006, volunteers led a two-day search within a few miles of where Maura's vehicle was found. In the closet of an A-Frame house, cadaver dogs allegedly went ""bonkers,"" identifying the possible presence of human remains.""

The ""help me"" thing gives me chills whenever I think about it. Personally, I think she was probably on foot late at night and simply got abducted, and probably murdered. It might also be worth noting that she also crashed her father's car two days before the appearance after being at a party, and the day before that, received a phone call while at work at 1 AM which ""caused her to become upset"" and she had to be escorted back to her dorm room.",,False,,t5_2wvvc,False,,,True,t3_1cbape,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1cbape/the_disappearance_of_maura_murray/,

I first heard about her years ago.  I was obsessed with a book called Among the Missing, and her story was told there, along with a photo which I thought at the time was pretty creepy.  

Basically, Dorothy was married to a magistrate who had two kids from a previous marriage.  Together they had a third.  They lived in the suburbs of Philadelphia.  One evening, Dorothy was returning home from shopping when she was brutally attacked and beaten.  Her nose and jaw were broken and she was terribly bruised.  A neighbor had seen someone close to Dorothy as she was walking into her house -- possibly her attacker.

After that, Dorothy got very paranoid and skittish.  One evening her husband had to go to a banquet (why didn't Dorothy go, I always wondered).  The oldest child was at a friend's house.  The other two children were 9 and 3.  The husband came home, and the kids were huddled together in fear.  The 9 year old said she'd heard some scary sounds.  She saw her mother lying face down on a rug.  A man was there.  He told her to go back to bed.  He said her mother had been ill, but now she was okay.  She saw the man pick her up and carry her over his shoulder.  He locked the door before leaving.  Dorothy was never seen again.

This guy's info on Facebook is pretty much what I remember from Among the Missing, including Dorothy's picture that always haunted me.

She left two 50$ bills one for the coroner and one for the cemetery with the same typed note:
 
""Deceased by own hand...prefer no autopsy. Please order cremation with funds provided. Thank you, Jane Doe""
 
She was located inside Pleasant Valley Memorial Park, a small cemetery in Annandale, Virginia. There was a clear plastic sheet on the ground. Next to the sheet was an 8"" Christmas tree, adorned with gold balls and red ribbons. 

In addition to drinking brandy (she had a 0.14 blood-alcohol level) and swallowing Valium, the victim had two empty juice bottles and a new roll of masking tape in her knapsack. She had no receipts in her pockets to enable police to trace her movements. In her backpack, she also had a Jeff Foxworthy ""You might be a redneck"" cassette and a ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" tape. She had a portable tape player, the headphones over her ears and had listened to a recording of comedians Mel Brooks and Carl Reiner doing their ""2000 year old man"" routine. She had placed a plastic bag over her head and tied it off with tape. This made her suffocate. 

The site she chose, Pleasant Valley, probably wouldn't be known to a drifter. She lay down near the section of the cemetery where infants are buried, but not near any particular grave, and most of the stones nearby were fairly recent.

Nearly all of her clothing was of the brand ""Classiques Entier"", an upscale brand sold primarily at Nordstroms and Saks 5th Avenue.

I've always found it strange how someone who is apparently well-off and had given birth at least once in the past can remain anonymous for so long.  It seems like she would have left behind children or friends or neighbors who would be wondering where she is?  At the very least an empty house.

It's possible she had no surviving children considering she chose to commit suicide near where infants are buried.  However, given that she was roughly 60, it's safe to assume her child would have been born at LEAST 20 years prior (so not likely a major factor in her suicide).

Also odd how cheery she seemed to have tried to make her death.  The Christmas tree, the comedy tapes, etc.

My older sister lives in Nebraska and works in counseling and rehab, presently with juvenile offenders.  In the mid-1990's she met a man who was new at her office and they fell in love.  They were married in the late 1990's, and I was the ring bearer at their wedding (no young males in our family, I was about 8 at the time).  He was a really great guy for her, he was always kind, generous, caring, and he was great with my sister and I.  I remember when they would come to visit he would play hide-and-go-seek with us.

Many years went by and both my sister and Michael continued their jobs in the field of social work, bought a house in Nebraska, purchased a car together, and visited us regularly in Kansas City.  Everything seemed to be going great and they always seemed happy while visiting.  I remember going antique shopping with them, and going to used book stores - their favorite activities.

One day when I was a senior in high school my father received a phone call from one of his family members.  Michael had driven my sister to work that morning and dropped her off at 7:30 a.m., as they always did, went to a gas station to fuel up his car (which they have on security video), drove into a parking garage near his office, parked his car, and was never seen or heard from again.

There was no activity on his credit card, cell phone, or social security number.  He left no note, took no money, made no indication what-so-ever that he would be leaving.  He just vanished.

My sister established search parties and hung up flyers begging anyone for information they might have as to his whereabouts.  The only tip that came in was that someone at the Little King Restaurant had seen him in their store purchasing lunch hours after his office reported to my sister that he had not come into work.

Months and months went by and nothing further was learned.  When my sister had married him, none of his family was in attendance at the wedding.  He stated that he was estranged from them, his Dad being a serious military man and he being a peace loving individual - they never got along.  His family in Louisiana eventually got word that he was missing and hired a private investigator to search for him.  

This is when my sister learned that he had previously had a family in Colorado, and a baby.  She also learned that in 1996 he attempted to commit suicide by overdosing on pills, but it was a failed attempt.  Apparently after that had happened, he left Colorado, came to Nebraska, and that is when he met my sister.

A little over a year later, his remains were found under a bridge at a construction site which had been closed due to loss in funding but recently reopened as the funding returned.  This happened in 2008 - February, I remember walking across the quad, at night, at my college and receiving a phone call from my Mom letting me know they had found his body.

They sent his body to KU to be examined by some of the top forensic experts in the country but their findings were inconclusive.  Given his previously suicide attempt, it is likely that he commit suicide, but we will never know for sure.  Everyone interviewed regarding him - coworkers, my sister, etc. - said there was nothing at all to indicate he was depressed or that he was going to attempt suicide.  He did it two days before Valentines Day.

Little is still known about his life - what he did after leaving Louisiana, how he ended up in Colorado, we still don't know the name of the woman and his baby in Colorado, nor do we know how he left there.  There's a chance he was caught up in something none of us ever knew about, or perhaps he was just depressed and never told anyone.

You see these kinds of things on TV but you never think they'll happen so close to home.  My sister still thinks about him daily.  She has a new boyfriend, but she's never remarried.

It was created in the 18th century, disappeared during World War II, and was recreated in 2003.


Before it was lost, the Amber Room was sometimes dubbed the ""Eighth Wonder of the World"" due to its singular beauty. Construction of the Amber Room began in 1701 to 1711 in Prussia. The room was designed by German baroque sculptor Andreas Schlüter and Danish amber craftsman Gottfried Wolfram in the service of the Prussian king worked on it until 1707, then work was continued by amber masters Gottfried Turau and Ernst Schacht from Danzig. The amber cabinet remained in Berlin City Palace until 1716 when it was given by Prussian king Friedrich Wilhelm I to his then ally, Tsar Peter the Great of the Russian Empire. In Russia it was expanded and after several renovations, it covered more than 55 square meters and contained over six tons of amber. It was finished in 1755 and restored in 1830. **The Amber Room was looted during World War II by Nazi Germany and brought to Königsberg. Knowledge of its whereabouts was lost in the chaos at the end of the war.**""

The theater, located in the Brighton Park neighborhood of Chicago, was around one-and-a-half miles from their McKinley Park home. In their pockets they had $2.15, but it is unknown how they arrived at the theater (whether they took the bus or walked). They were seen in the popcorn line of the theater around 9:30 pm, after the first showing of the film. The second show was over by about 11 pm, and they were expected home around 11:45 pm. At 2:15 am, the two sisters were reported missing by their mother.

Their disappearance launched one of the biggest missing-persons hunts in Chicago history. However, police were unable to determine what happened to the Grimes sisters.
On January 19, 1957, a statement attributed to Presley was issued: ""If you are good Presley fans, you'll go home and ease your mother's worries.""

Following a thaw and rain, on January 22, 1957, a construction worker named Leonard Prescott found the naked bodies of the Grimes sisters behind a guard rail off German Church Road, in unincorporated Willow Springs (later incorporated as part of Willowbrook in 1960). Barbara Grimes lay on her left side with her legs slightly drawn up toward her body. Patricia Grimes covered the head of her sister. She lay on her back and her head was turned sharply to the right. 

The autopsy, performed by experienced pathologists, earned much criticism. Due to their stomach contents containing the approximate proportions of their last meal, it was determined that the Grimes sisters died on December 28, the day they vanished, and the cause of death was due to secondary shock resulting from exposure to low temperature. The finding was arrived at only through a process of exclusion.

Harry Glos, chief investigator for the Cook County coroner's office, believed that the Grimes sisters were *still alive* when their bodies were dumped on German Church Road. He stated that the thin ice layer on the bodies of the girls indicated that their bodies must still have been warm when they were discarded there and that heavy snowfall as recent as January 13, 1957 should have buried the bodies in snow. Therefore, according to this theory, the Grimes sisters must have been still alive until at least January 7. After publicly criticizing the investigation, Glos was fired by Coroner Walter E. McCarron on February 15, 1957.

Also, the corpses contained various bruises and marks, including three puncture wounds in Barbara's chest that may have come from an ice pick, which were never fully explained. Glos theorized that Barbara Grimes had been sexually molested before she was killed and although the pathologists initially denied the claim, the Chief of Detectives confirmed on the same day Glos was fired that the Chicago crime lab had reported finding that while Barbara Grimes did have sexual intercourse around the time of the murders, there was no evidence of violence or sexual molestation.

Kidnapping:
Jacob, his brother, and a friend were cycling home from a convenience store on October 22, 1989, when a masked gunman came out of a driveway and ordered the boys to throw their bikes into a ditch and lie down on the ground. He then asked each boy his age. Jacob's brother and friend were told to run toward a nearby wooded area and not look back or else he would shoot them. After a short run, both boys did look back and saw the gunman grab Jacob by the elbow and walk him away. The whereabouts of Jacob and the identity of the gunman remain unknown.

Jacob's parents,  Jerry and Patty Wetterling, formed the Jacob Wetterling Foundation, an advocacy group for children's safety. In 1994, the Jacob Wetterling Act was passed in his honor.

Thanks you /u/ishakewell for the link.

While this part of the page being removed does cast a great deal of doubt into what it said. I would love to see an outside source confirming it. However, it does bring more focus to the actual kidnapping, which in my opinion is incredibly strange in comparison to many disappearances mentioned on here, seeing as there were two witnesses who escaped, the abduction was performed in a fairly residential location, and there has been a continuing investigation of the event up to this day, despite the fact that there has been no real clues or indications that Jacob is alive, at least that have been made available to the public (expect of course the events in 2009).

Followup: Read the Trivia section of the Wikipedia page, it's really chilling and odd. While it is obvious that the mind of a consistently grief stricken mother will generate these sorts of things. The last few sentences are just strange and nearly unbelievable. There are no sources on that bit of the Wikipedia page, and I had never heard it prior to reading this, so I'll let you all discuss it.",,False,,t5_2wvvc,1370202345.0,,,True,t3_1ff9am,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1ff9am/the_disappearance_of_jacob_wetterling/,

In the Winter of 1959, nine hikers died while traversing the Ural mountains in Russia. Soviet investigators concluded that a ""compelling natural force"" was what caused the deaths.

Information from Wikipedia: 


* Six of the group members died of hypothermia and three of fatal injuries.

* There were no indications of other people nearby, nor anyone in the surrounding areas.

* The tent had been ripped open from within.

* The victims had died 6 to 8 hours after their last meal.

* Traces from the camp showed that all group members left the camp of their own accord, on foot, most barefoot or clad only in socks.

* To dispel the theory of an attack by the indigenous Mansi people, Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny stated that the fatal injuries of the three bodies could not have been caused by another human being, ""because the force of the blows had been too strong and no soft tissue had been damaged"".

* Forensic radiation tests had shown high doses of radioactive contamination on the clothes of a few victims.

""A medical examination of the first five bodies found no injuries which might have led to their deaths, and it was concluded that they had all died of hypothermia. Slobodin had a small crack in his skull, but it was not thought to be a fatal wound.

An examination of the four bodies which were found in May changed the picture. Three of them had fatal injuries: the body of Thibeaux-Brignolles had major skull damage, and both Dubunina and Zolotarev had major chest fractures. According to Dr. Boris Vozrozhdenny, the force required to cause such damage would have been extremely high. He compared it to the force of a car crash. Notably, the bodies had no external wounds, as if they were crippled by a high level of pressure. Dubunina was found to be missing her tongue.""

In a well-kept Georgian townhouse, Lady Lucan, the wife of John Bingham, 7th Earl of Lucan, goes down the stairs to the basement, where she had sent the family's nanny, Sandra Rivett (aged 29) to make a cup of tea several minutes previous, wondering what the delay was.

Suddenly she is attacked by a masked man who grabbed her and told her to ""shut up"". She would later recount that it was her husband's voice. They fought for several minutes until Lucan took off his mask and admitted that he had killed the nanny. In the basement lay a cloth sack with her body inside, bludgeoned to death with a bandaged lead pipe. He begged his wife to help him escape. She agreed if he would stay a few days. As he went to treat his wounds in the bathroom, she fled from an upstairs window to a nearby pub. He called at a friend's house some time after 10pm but she ignored the door. Soon afterwards the same friend received an incoherent, babbling phone call and hung up. Blood stains would be discovered on her doorstep the next morning. Lucan called his mother and asked her to look after the children, speaking of a ""terrible catastrophe"". He said he had seen his wife fighting with a man and come into the house. He then drove to Uckfield in Sussex where he visited his friend, Susan Maxwell-Scott. This would be the last sighting of Lucan.

As the police forced their way into his home, finding the body of Rivett, they were forced to look at the life of Lord Lucan. It seemed that the perfect life had gone wrong. Born in 1934 to an aristocratic family, he was schooled at Eton and in the United States before serving in the Coldstream Guards in Germany as a Lieutenant. After his service, he became a banker, holidaying in the Bahamas and developing a taste for gambling. One night at the Clermont Club in London he lost £8,000 (his annual income being £12,000) in just one night. Further nights at the casino cost him £10,000. He drove an Aston Martin and was even considered for the role of James Bond that was given to Sean Connery. By September 1974, Lucan and his wife had separated despite still living together, and he had taken to staying all night in casinos. In two months he ran up debts of £50,000, an astronomical sum in 1974 when a loaf of bread cost 2p (£0.02). At the time of his disappearance he was overdrawn to the tune of £25,000 just to banks, not to count private creditors.

Early morning on 8 November. Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrives at 46 Lower Belgrave Street. Sandra Rivett is pronounced dead from blunt force trauma. A blood-stained towel is found in the bedroom. The basement stairs are drenched in blood and a pipe with bandages wrapped round it is nearby. Blood is found on leaves in the back garden. The police also show up at Lucan's second apartment. His wallet, keys, driving licence and glasses are on the bedside table. A suit and shirt are laid out on the bed. His passport is in a drawer nearby. His blue Mercedes-Benz (he had sold his Aston Martin recently) is outside with the engine cold and the battery flat; he could not afford to fuel it.

An autopsy is conducted on Sandra Rivett. Her husband, Roger, has a good alibi for that night. The focus shifts to Lucan. Would he come forward to help the police with their inquiries? Newspapers and TV stations circulate his image. Two letters, dated 7 Nov 1964, arrive at Lucan's brother-in-law's house, with blood stains on the paper. In them, Lucan speaks of ""interrupting a fight"" and ""being accused of hiring the man that killed Sandra"". He says he's going to lie low, and that for his children ""knowing their father had stood in the dock for attempted murder would be too much"". He also leaves instructions on paying the bank back with a pre-arranged auction of his property. He signs the second letter ""The other creditors can get lost for the time being. Lucky."" It would be the last anyone would hear from Lucan.

The Ford Corsair that Lucan had driven away from London was found abandoned in Newhaven, 16 miles from Uckfield on 10 November. It had a piece of lead pipe wrapped in surgical tape and a full bottle of vodka in the back. Its owner, Michael Stoop, a friend of Lucan's from the gambling circuit, received a letter a day later from Lucan stating that he ""had had a traumatic night of unbelievable coincidence"". Ranson suspected that Lucan had committed suicide, and searched the area around the town and its harbour for any remains but found none. A warrant for Lucan's arrest was issued on 12 November and circulated by Interpol. The pipe in the car had traces of blood from Sandra Rivett.

At the inquest into the death of the nanny, the landlord of the pub which Lady Lucan had ran into described how she was ""head to toe in blood"" and reportedly said ""Help me, help me, I've just escaped from being murdered"" and ""my children, my children, he's murdered my nanny"" without mentioning a name. Death was caused by blunt head injuries and inhalation of blood. Susan Maxwell-Scott testified that when she had seen Lucan he seemed ""dishevelled, with his hair a little ruffled"". Lucan had told her that he was walking, or passing by the house when he saw Veronica being attacked by a man. He let himself in but slipped in a pool of blood at the bottom of the stairs.

The inquest's jury returned a verdict that Lucan had murdered his nanny. However Lucan's friends protested his innocence. No fingerprints of his were found at the scene and no letter mentioned the lead pipe left in the Ford Corsair. The evidence against him was somewhat compelling; he claimed to have seen a man attacking Sandra in the basement, which would have required him to stoop down and look into the window, compounded by the fact that the lightbulb in the basement had been removed and left aside.

Lucan was last seen at 1.15am on 8 November 1974, after which he disappeared into thin air. His friends insist that he committed suicide, his wife insisting that he did it ""like the nobleman he was"". However, rumours that the Earl had moved to South Africa persisted. Lucan's brother insisted that this was the case. Another rumour was that he had travelled to Switzerland, where he was killed for shady financial dealings with the ""Clermont Set"". Since then, sightings have been reported in France, Colombia, India, New Zealand, Gabon, Namibia and South Africa. 

Some questions:

* Did Lucan murder the nanny? If so, why? He surely had no motive.

* Why did Lucan insist his innocence despite the breadth of evidence against him?

* How did he escape the country without a passport, or any source of income?

* Why would he be so stupid as to leave a murder weapon in an abandoned car?",,False,,t5_2wvvc,False,,,True,t3_1etabp,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1etabp/lord_lucan/,

As we know, Aum Shinrikyo are a Japanese cult that are listed as a terrorist group around the world. They are most notorious for their 1995 sarin gas attack on the Tokyo Metro. 

Two years before this, however, a seismic event was detected near the Banjawarn station, a remote sheep station 500 miles north east of Perth. 

This is how Bill Bryson described it:


&gt;  At 11:03 PM local time on May 28, 1993, a large-scale seismic disturbance, elsewhere reported as measuring 3.9 on the Richter scale, was detected near the Banjawarn sheep station in remote western Australia. The few observers in the area reported seeing a flash in the sky and hearing an explosion. 
    The blast was 170 times more powerful than the biggest mining explosion ever recorded in the region and was consistent with a meteorite strike, but no crater could be found. 
    In 1995, after the Aum Shinrikyo in Japan had released nerve gas in the Tokyo subway system and killed 12 people, it was revealed that the cult owned a 500,000-acre property in western Australia near the site of the mysterious boom. 
    The cult has two former Soviet nuclear engineers in its ranks, hopes eventually to destroy the world, and maybe wanted a bit of practice, eh? 
    In 1997, scientists finally got around to investigating this disquieting possibility. ""You take my point,"" Bryson writes. ""This is a country . . . so vast and empty that a band of amateur enthusiasts could conceivably set off the world's first nongovernmental atomic bomb on its mainland and almost four years would pass before anyone noticed.*

I'm very skeptical of this because these stories only really emerged after UFO activist played up the link between Aum and this event.

However, we do know that they did own the land, so who knows?

**Background:**

The [Isabella Stewart Gardener Museum](http://www.gardnermuseum.org/home/) was established in 1903 by Isabella Gardener- a Bostonian socialite, philanthropist, and collector and lover of art.  For years prior, Isabella had dedicated her life to collecting works of art and artifacts from across Europe and America with the help of art historian Bernard Berenson.  Featuring works by Boticelli, Rembrandt, Titian, Vermeer, John Singer Sargent (who was a personal friend), Matisse, Raphael, and others, her collection is one of world importance.  The museum was curated by Isabella herself and when she died, it was left to the city with the stipulation that none of the works be moved or rearranged.

**The Theft:**

In the early morning hours after St. Patrick's Day 1990, two men gained access to the museum pretending to be Boston PD who were there responding to a (fake) report of a disturbance in the museum's courtyard.  They then handcuffed the museum guards on duty and proceeded upstairs.  The theft took about an hour and a half, the thieves making two trips to their car with the goods.  The handcuffed guards were left bound, until actual Boston police reported to the scene the following morning.  The frames holding the paintings are still hanging empty today as a reminder of the theft and in accordance with Isabella's request not to alter her arrangement of the collection.

**The Stolen Works:**

Thirteen total works were stolen: 

* [The Concert](http://historicartgallery.com/store/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/V/e/Vermeer-Pic0022.jpg_4.jpg) by Vermeer (a renowned 17th century Dutch painter with a surprisingly small body of known works)

**Investigation and recent discoveries:**

Many people have pointed the finger towards Whitey Bulger and the Boston mob, others have tried to tie the IRA to the theft.  There have been many leads and accusations over the years, but law enforcement has yet to pinpoint the theives or recover the art.  There was originally a one million dollar reward for information that resulted in recovering the work, which was upped to 5 million in 1997- and a large reward often drums up plenty of false accusations.  Some have speculated that FBI corruption has to do with why this theft has gone so long unsolved.  In March or 2013, the FBI released information that it has tied the Philadelphia mob to the theft, though it hasn't released any information about specific persons involved and the artwork has yet to be recovered.  The FBI expressed that they feel the investigation is in it's final stages- but I will consider this mystery unresolved until names are named and the whereabouts of the artwork are revealed.


There is a documentary [Stolen](http://movies.netflix.com/WiMovie/70044970?strkid=2942036_1_0&amp;trkid=222336&amp;movieid=70044970) (2006), available on netflix.

Their existence is unproven, but many suggestions exist to explain how these animals might have come to inhabit Britain, including that they are animals released after the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976 came into force, or that they are surviving Ice Age fauna.

Their quest took them to an old, hollow wych–hazel – also known as a wych–elm, on account of its size and age. For a minute or two they climbed and searched. Then one of them, Bob Farmer, gave a cry: from out of the tree, a white skull was grinning at him. ""There was a small patch of rotting flesh on the forehead with lank hair attaching to it, and the two front teeth were crooked,"" he later stated.

The frightened boys ran away and – unsure if the skull was human or animal but certain that they should not have been in the woods in the first place – at first told no one about their find. Then Tommy Willetts, the youngest, told his father, who told the police. Their investigation uncovered the more–or–less entire skeleton of a young woman within the tree. Her mouth was stuffed with taffeta, and a gold wedding ring and some crepe shoes were found nearby – but perhaps most chillingly of all, one of her hands was missing. This, it was suggested, was a classic sign of a black–magic execution.

Subsequent examination – by the well–known forensic scientist Professor James Webster – suggested that the dead woman had been 35, was the mother of one child, and had been dead for about 18 months before she was found. The coroner declared it murder, with asphyxiation the probable cause. Exhaustive trawls through dental records and missing–person files proved unexpectedly fruitless, and the press were briefly enthralled. But, before long, the horrors of war distracted attention from the ""Tree Murder Riddle"".

But then, that Christmas, the graffiti began to appear. ""Who put Luebella down the wych–elm?"" said the first one, in nearby Old Hill. ""Hagley Wood Bella"", said another, in Birmingham. Gradually, the messages – which seemed to be written by the same hand – took what was to be their settled form: ""Who put Bella in the wych–elm?"" they asked.

Roberto Calvi was chairman of Banco Ambrosiano, a private Italian bank which went bankrupt in 1982. The scandal was huge and implicated their major shareholders - The Vatican Bank - directly as much of the money had been illegially siphoned off via their account. (They later settled with payments to shareholders.) 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banco_Ambrosiano

Calvi fled the country via Venice and private jet and was found dead 8 days later, hung by the neck beneath Blackfriars bridge by London's financial district with $15,000 in various currencies stuffed in his pockets along with several bricks. On the day before he was discovered, his secretary threw herself out of her office window in Milan and fell to her death.

Calvi's death was first ruled a suicide, a second inquest ruled an 'open verdict' and then a third, murder. His secretary's death was ruled suicide, but among a great deal of suspicion. 

A mafia informer claimed in 1991 that Calvi was murdered by them as punishment due to their money being lost along with the vatican's, but he along with many others were all found not guilty at a subsequent trial.

Although so much evidence points to the mafia, it's still unproven (In 2003 the City of London Police reopened Calvi's case as a murder investigation) and the story even involves secretive masonic organisations, (of which Calvi was a member) his bank, Banco Ambrosiano allegedly funding Nicaraguan Contras, anti-government Polish trade unions, and even suggestions of connections to the death of Pope John Paul the first.

My first reaction to the more wild rumours surrounding the case is mild irritation at what sounds like absurd conspiracy theories so feel free to agree or disagree. There are plenty to choose from when you start to look and the whole thing is fascinating, to me at least.

This is my first post here and the above is only a very brief outline of everything that happened so apologies for any small mistakes or deviations from proper posting form.

The intruders would have required commercial grade equipment as well as a sophisticated knowledge of microwave and broadcasting technology. Many have suspected University of Chicago or Columbia College students of being behind the video piracy -- perhaps an unhappy broadcast engineering student who was an intern with WGN-TV.

The body was dry and clean. The boy’s arms were carefully folded across his stomach. The finger and toenails had been recently trimmed short and neat. His hair had been cut recently – very close to the head, in a crude, hurried way, perhaps as a deliberate attempt to conceal the child’s identity. Small clumps of cut hair clung to his entire body, suggesting that someone had groomed him while he was unclothed, probably either shortly before or immediately after death. There were many bruises all over the child’s body; particularly on the head and face. All of the bruises appeared to have been inflicted at the same time.

She was playing outside on a somewhat rainy day when she disappeared; she was five years old and there was a creek behind the house.  It seems logical that she fell into the creek and sadly drowned.

However, there are many bizarre twists and turns in this story.  Anna's parents were divorced.  She lived with her mother and stepfather.  Her natural father was schizophrenic and living with a very mysterious man who seemed to have a fascination with Anna.  Is it possible Anna's father and his odd friend had something to do with Anna's disappearance, either to hurt Anna's mother or for some other unknown reason?

Also, not long before the disappearance Anna and her older brothers were out walking.  Her brothers reported than an out-of-state car pulled over and a woman tried to lure Anna, just Anna, into the car.  Her brothers got her away, but is it possible someone was watching Anna, waiting to abduct her?  They lived in a somewhat remote area.

There have been many, many dead-end leads in this case.  It's quite frustrating.  Over the years I have held my breath as one possibility after another fizzled away to nothing.  It is widely regarded that Anna was abducted and adopted, and may be a grown woman not even realizing she is a missing child.

Or maybe she did fall in the creek and was swept away to sea.

Nothing ever in Nature was seen.
Touch the earth I expire, in water I die,
In air I lose breath, yet can swim and can fly;
Darkness destroys me, and light is my death,
And I only keep going by holding my breath.

By a woman or girl it certainly can.

[From wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism)

The Antikythera mechanism (/ˌæntɨkɨˈθɪərə/ ANT-i-ki-THEER-ə or /ˌæntɨˈkɪθərə/ ANT-i-KITH-ə-rə) is an ancient analog computer[1][2][3][4] designed to calculate astronomical positions. It was recovered in 1900–1901 from the Antikythera wreck,[5] but its significance and complexity were not understood until a century later. Jacques Cousteau visited the wreck in 1978[6] but, although he found new dating evidence, he did not find any additional remains of the Antikythera mechanism. The construction has been dated to the early 1st century BCE. Technological artifacts approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the 14th century CE, when mechanical astronomical clocks began to be built in Western Europe.[7]

Professor Michael Edmunds of Cardiff University, who led a 2006 study of the mechanism, said:[8][9]

""This device is just extraordinary, the only thing of its kind. The design is beautiful, the astronomy is exactly right. The way the mechanics are designed just makes your jaw drop. Whoever has done this has done it extremely carefully ... in terms of historic and scarcity value, I have to regard this mechanism as being more valuable than the Mona Lisa.""—30 November 2006

The Antikythera mechanism is kept at the National Archaeological Museum of Athens. It is now displayed at the temporary exhibition about the Antikythera Shipwreck,[10] accompanied by reconstructions made by Ioannis Theofanidis, Derek de Solla Price, Michael Wright, the Thessaloniki University and Dionysios Kriaris. Other reconstructions are on display at the American Computer Museum in Bozeman, Montana, the Children's Museum of Manhattan in New York, in Kassel, Germany, and at the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris.

The mechanism was housed in a wooden box approximately 340 × 180 × 90 mm in size and comprised 30 bronze gears (although more could have been lost). The largest gear, clearly visible in fragment A, was approximately 140 mm in diameter and had 223 teeth. The mechanism's remains were found as 82 separate fragments of which only seven contain any gears or significant inscriptions.

&gt;Police interviewed Josh Powell and their 4-year-old son, Charlie.[26] The child confirmed that the camping trip Josh described took place;[27] **however, unlike his father he stated that Susan had gone with them and she did not return.[24] Weeks after her disappearance, a teacher reported that Charlie said his mother was dead.[24] The parents of Susan Powell said that while at daycare several months after Susan's disappearance, Braden drew a picture of a van with three people in it, and told caregivers that ""Mommy was in the trunk.""**[28]

Josh got a lawyer and stopped cooperating with the police.  He moved to Puyallup, Washington with his father, Steve.  

In 2010, a web site, SusanPowell.org appeared, described as the ""official web site of Susan Powell.""  On the site, an anonymous author described Josh as a loving father and grieving husband who was the subject of a smear campaign.  Naturally, it is suspected that Josh and/or his father were behind the site.

Steve was later arrested on child pornography and voyeurism charges - one charge in particular was a bit disturbing.  He was accused of secretly videotaping Susan Powell.

Because of these disturbing allegations, Susan Powell's father, Chuck Cox, asked a court to grant him custody of the children.

Then, in February of 2012, while the boys went on a supervised visit to Josh's home, the social worker who accompanied them made a call to 911.  She said that Josh had grabbed the kids away from her and locked her out of the house. She called 911, telling the operator that she smelled gas fumes and feared for the kids' safety.  The operator didn't send the police out right away, instead interrogating the social worker and telling her that ""We have to respond to emergency life-threatening situations first.""

And then the house exploded.

The subsequent investigation showed that the explosion had been deliberately planned. Although Josh and the two boys had officially been determined to have died from carbon monoxide poisoning, the children had sustained a ""chopping"" injury, probably committed with a hatchet that was found on the scene.

Steven Powell was informed about their deaths while he was in jail but didn't seem surprised in the least.  He has maintained his silence on the topic of Susan's disappearance.

In another odd twist to the story, Josh's brother Michael Powell killed himself in February of 2013 by jumping off a parking garage in Minneapolis.  Michael was the beneficiary of Josh's life insurance policy and one of Josh's most ardent supporter.

In May of this year, Utah police closed their investigation into Susan's disappearance.

His mysterious death has never been resolved.  He left behind a wife and two children.

On December 3, 2003, Luna was working late at his office in Baltimore, hammering out the last details of a plea-bargain.  What happened after he left the office a little before midnight is a mystery.  The Wikipedia entry on his death gives the following timeline:

* 11:38 pm: Luna left the Baltimore courthouse and went northeast on I-95. He used his E-ZPass on I-95 into Delaware but not on the New Jersey and Pennsylvania Turnpikes. After three toll interchanges, he switched to buying toll tickets.

* 12:57 am: $200 was withdrawn from Luna's bank account from the ATM at the JFK Plaza service center near Newark, Delaware.

* 02:47 am: he crossed the Delaware toll bridge to the Pennsylvania Turnpike.

* 03:20 am: his debit card bought gas at the Sunoco King of Prussia service plaza.

* 04:04 am: his car exited the turnpike at the Reading-Lancaster interchange. The toll ticket had a spot of his blood on it suggesting that he was already injured. His car was parked at the back of the Sensenig &amp; Weaver Well Drilling company at 1439 Dry Tavern Road, Denver, Pennsylvania (Brecknock Township) before it was later driven into the creek.

* 05:00 am: the first employee of Sensenig &amp; Weaver arrived.

* 05:30 am: the car was noticed, with its lights off and the front end into the stream. Blood was smeared over the driver's door and the front left of the car. Luna was face down in the stream under the car engine. He was wearing a suit and a black overcoat with his court ID around his neck. A pool of blood was found on the rear seat floor. Although stabbed 36 times with his own penknife around the chest and neck plus a head injury, the death was due to drowning.

There has been a lot of speculation about his death.  Although the Pennsylvania medical examiner has maintained that it was a homicide, others have suggested that his career was not going as well as he liked and it was speculated that he was in debt or that he was having an affair.  There was also an allegation that he was to be questioned in the theft of $36,000 in cash from a bank robbery case he had prosecuted.

No leads have provided an explanation as to what really happened that night, although in 2004 the FBI released a statement saying that Luna was alone from the time he left the office until the time his body was found, suggesting that the FBI believed it was a suicide.

The Pennsylvania medical examiner, however, points to the nature and extent of his wounds (including to his hands, throat and scrotum) that are not consistent with suicide.  In addition, Luna left his glasses (which he needed to drive) and cell phone at his desk.  Finally, the fact that there was blood pooled in the back seat of his car may indicate that he was a passenger at some point during the journey and not a driver.  

There was also a report that a second person's blood was found in the car but the details on that are not very clear from the media articles I have read.

Be forewarned, it's a LONG read, but it's a pretty good story. 

Basic outline of the case is as follows: little girl (7) vanishes one night (time in dispute) after receiving a piggyback ride from an unknown male. The little girl was with her 8 year old friend, whose ID of the piggyback-provider ended up being arguably the key in the prosecutor's case. The man (~16 ish at the time) they convicted lived in the town at the time and ended up being kind of a creep with a checkered history with the opposite sex. His current wife and stepdaughter are defending him pretty vehemently and the case is under appeal. 

My issue with the case -- the CNN writer repeatedly emphasizes that this is a small town where everybody knows everybody, and this guy lived in that town his whole life, yet for some reason the girl couldn't ID him until 50+ years after the initial investigation -- relatedly, he was cleared in the initial FBI investigation, a piece of evidence that was rather curiously deemed inadmissible at trial. 

Anyway if you're a fan of stories like this one I highly recommend setting aside some time to read the series (I think it's four parts).

Unusual lights have been reported here since 1940s or earlier. Especially high activity of Hessdalen lights took place from December 1981 until the summer of 1984 when lights were observed 15 to 20 times per week. The frequency of the lights caused a gathering of numerous tourists staying there overnight to see the phenomenon. Since then, the activity has decreased and now the lights are observed some 10 - 20 times per year.
The Hessdalen light most often is a bright, white or yellow light of unknown origin standing or floating above the ground level. Sometimes the light can be seen for more than one hour. There are several other types of unexplained lights observed in the Hessdalen valley.

There have been a handful of possible explanations given, however to this day the strange lights remain a mystery not just to science, but to the world.

Plus, this one literally hits close to home. We don't get a lot of cases like this in San Antonio.

The following is from the Charley Project:

7 month old Gabriel Johnson went missing in San Antonio in December of 2009 after being abducted by his mother, Elizabeth Joanne Johnson, from Tempe, Arizona. They stayed in two motels between December 22nd and 27th, the day he was last seen with his mother. That same day Elizabeth boarded a greyhound bus without her baby, leaving her car behind. She was supposed to appear in a custody hearing in Arizona on December 28th, but never showed up. She was arrested in a Miami, Florida hostel on December 30th and indicted for custodial interference, kidnapping, and child abuse.

On December 27th, Gabriel's father, Logan Scott McQueary received a series of disturbing text messaged from Elizabeth stating he'd never see Gabriel again because she had killed him and thrown his body in a dumpster. When interrogated by police, she denied harming their child and that was just trying to upset Logan.

Elizabeth claimed that she had given Gabriel to a childless couple for adoption whom she had met in a San Antonio park. She said she spent three days with the couple, but tried not to remember their names of what their car looked like so that she would not be able to find Gabriel if she changed her mind. 

At the time of his disappearance, Gabriel was bring considered for adoption by a couple in Arizona, Tammi Peters Smith and Jack Smith. They had bonded with the child after spending a few weeks with them. However, Logan refused to give up his parental rights and he felt like the couple was trying to coerce him into agreeing to the adoption. The man and woman are considered persons of interest in the disappearance because they were the last people to see Gabriel in Arizona. Authorities felt they might know more about Gabriel's location than they are admitting. They had supported Elizabeth throughout the ordeal and believe Gabriel is safe and might be returned if Logan agreed to relinquish custody to them.

While she maintains her innocence, Tammi was convicted of forgery, custodial interference, and conspiracy to commit custodial interference in May of 2012.

A private investigator hired by Logan McQueary believes Gabriel is stil alive and was given away or sold by Elizabeth. He claims to have evidence that a third party arranged for Elizabeth to meet this couple and give Gabriel to them. He described a man and woman as being in their thirties or forties. He believes the couple probably knew the adoption wasn't legal, and Gabriel is likely no longer in the San Antonio area.

An adoption expert stated the Homegate Hotel, one of the hotels where Elizabeth and Gabriel stayed, is known in adoption circles. Adoption agencies put birth mothers in the hotel to meet adoptive parents and complete the paperwork.

The last known photographs of Gabriel were taken on Elizabeth's cell phone and show him holding a medicine bottle, possibly infant Tylenol. He appears lethargic.

Elizabeth confessed to Gabriel's murder a number of times, once in a  jailhouse interview with a detective in May 2010. Her attorneys have said she was under the influence of medication at the time and was unable to give truthful answers to the questions.

In June 2010, Elizabeth was ruled incompetent to stand trial and spent three months in court-ordered treatment. She was eventually convicted to two of the three charges and sentences to 5 1/4 years in prison. She got credit for three years' time served and will be under probation for four years after release.

[Charley Project] (http://www.charleyproject.org/cases/j/johnson_gabriel.html)

The authorities searched the land fills for what seemed like weeks after his disappearance, and it was headline news off and on for years. After Elizabeth's conviction, it seemed like everyone just forgot about it. Even in searching today, I can't find much talk about the case since December of 2012. I remember thinking in 2009 and 2010 that she clearly murdered Gabriel, but it also seems possible that she simply gave him away. Either way, it's a very sad situation.",,False,,t5_2wvvc,False,,,True,t3_1iz77k,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1iz77k/where_is_baby_gabriel_johnson/,

Known collectively as The Beaumont Children, their case resulted in the largest police investigation in Australian criminal history but remains officially unsolved.

Police investigating the case found several witnesses who had seen the children near the beach, in the company of a lone male adult, described as being tall, with blond hair, and in his mid thirties. The children were playing with him, and appeared relaxed and to be enjoying themselves. The man and the children were seen walking away from the beach at 11.00 am. A shopkeeper reported Jane Beaumont had bought cakes with a one pound note shortly after this - money the children did not have and which was assumed to have been given to them by the man. At approximately 3 pm the children were seen walking alone, away from the beach in the direction of their home. The witness, a local postman, knew the children well, and his statement was regarded as factual. Police could not determine why the reliable children, already three hours late, were strolling alone and seemingly unconcerned. This was the last confirmed sighting of the children.

Mr. and Mrs. Beaumont did not know who the man might have been. They described their children, particularly Jane, as shy. For them to be playing so confidently with a stranger seemed out of character. Investigators theorized that the children had perhaps met the man during a previous visit or visits and had grown to trust him.

They were never seen again.

Not to be confused with an appliance, this is about a person giving a toast. (I know I read the title wrong the first time)

For an uncertain amount of years (decades in the very least), a mysterious figure appeared on Edgar Allan Poe's grave in Baltimore, Maryland every 19th of January, which is Poe's birthday, and raised a toast of cognac for him leaving the bottle and three roses in a distinctive pattern on the grave.

The tradition is believed to have begun in the 1930's, and was certainly apparent in the 60's, until it's apparent end in 2009 (bicentennial of Poe's birth). It is fairly certain the tradition was passed on to another person (""a son"" according to a previous note by the toaster) in the 90's.

Over the years the toaster left notes on the grave, some of which were merely marks of affection towards the deceased author, some latter ones even seemed to comment on recent events. (funnily enough the latter includes the 2001 Superbowl results, which the toaster failed to predict correctly)

What makes this especially interesting is the secretive nature of the toaster -- they have never seemed to seek attention, and have avoided onlookers when possible. Apparently out of respect, only one recent attempt was made to forcibly reveal the toaster's identity on site, and it ended in failure.

The toaster was clad in dark clothes and a wide-brimmed hat and carried a silver-tipped cane. It has been reported they made certain secretive motions each time that make imitating them difficult, although apparently attempts have been made.

Despite claims on the toaster's origin, their identity has not been verified as of today, and perhaps never will, unless some dramatic new evidence surfaces.

This wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe) gives you the basics.  The thing that gnaws at me is trying to imagine how the first people even came up with the idea to create this enormous complex with intricate carvings and pictograms.  How would you pay someone to do this before there was money? Before there was farming?  Before we even settled into villages?  

I just want to point out a few of the choice bits from that link.

*  &gt;The reliefs depict lions, bulls, boars, foxes, gazelles, donkeys, snakes and other reptiles, insects, arachnids, and birds, particularly vultures. (At the time the shrine was constructed, the surrounding country was much lusher and capable of sustaining this variety of wildlife, before millennia of settlement and cultivation led to the near–Dust Bowl conditions prevailing today.)

*  &gt;The discovery of a predator—a crocodile, perhaps, built low to the ground, very muscular, shown with teeth bared and featuring a long tail that nearly doubles back on itself—has excited special interest for being carved nearly in the round—hinting at a degree of social diversification and artistic training again unexpected in a community still mainly dependent on hunting for subsistence.

*  &gt;The site was deliberately backfilled sometime after 8000 BCE: the buildings were buried under debris, mostly flint gravel, stone tools, and animal bones that must have been imported from elsewhere.

Yeah, that's right.  I didn't even mention the really mind boggling part.  After going through all the trouble of basically creating society out of nothing, you guys decide to go through the ridiculous trouble of completely filling in your magnificent creation.   Let's be clear, this is not like a rival group came in, killed everyone and then tried to destroy the place.  Everything was in perfect order when it was, suddenly without apparent reason, completely filled in with **imported** debris. Think about it, there isn't any trash laying around because before you created this, nobody has been living together in groups large enough or long enough to create the amount detritus necessary to handle this job. 

*  &gt;But the complex was not simply abandoned and forgotten to be gradually destroyed by the elements. Instead, each enclosure was deliberately buried under as much as 300 to 500 cubic meters (390 to 650 cu yd) of debris consisting mainly of small limestone fragments, stone vessels, and stone tools; many animal, even human, bones have also been identified in the burial refuse.[24] Why the enclosures were backfilled is unknown, but it preserved them for posterity.

*  &gt;All statements about the site must be considered preliminary, as less than 5% of the site has so far been dug, and Schmidt plans to leave much of it untouched to be explored by future generations (when archaeological techniques will presumably have advanced).[4] So far, very little evidence for residential use has been found. Through the radiocarbon method, the end of Layer III can be fixed at c. 9000 BCE (see above); it is believed that the location could have served as a spiritual center prior to 11,000 BCE or even earlier.

*  &gt;Thus, the structures not only predate pottery, metallurgy, and the invention of writing or the wheel; they were built before the so-called Neolithic Revolution, i.e., the beginning of agriculture and animal husbandry around 9000 BCE. But the construction of Göbekli Tepe implies organization of an order of complexity not hitherto associated with Paleolithic, PPNA, or PPNB societies. Archaeologists estimate that up to 500 persons were required to extract the heavy pillars from local quarries and move them 100–500 meters (330–1,640 ft) to the site.[22] The pillars weigh 10–20 metric tons (10–20 long tons; 11–22 short tons), with one still in the quarry weighing 50 tons.[23] It is generally believed that an elite class of religious leaders supervised the work and later controlled whatever ceremonies took place here. If so, this would be the oldest known evidence for a priestly caste—much earlier than such social distinctions developed elsewhere in the Near East.[4]

*  &gt;Göbekli Tepe is regarded as an archaeological discovery of the greatest importance since it could profoundly change our understanding of a crucial stage in the development of human societies. ""Göbekli Tepe changes everything,"" says Ian Hodder of Stanford University. David Lewis-Williams, professor of archaeology at Witwatersrand University in Johannesburg, says that ""Göbekli Tepe is the most important archaeological site in the world."" It seems that the erection of monumental complexes was within the capacities of hunter-gatherers and not only of sedentary farming communities as had been previously assumed. In other words, as excavator Klaus Schmidt puts it, ""First came the temple, then the city.""

*  &gt;Not only its large dimensions, but the side-by-side existence of multiple pillar shrines makes the location unique. There are no comparable monumental complexes from its time. Nevalı Çori, a well-known Neolithic settlement also excavated by the German Archaeological Institute and submerged by the Atatürk Dam since 1992, is 500 years later, its T-shaped pillars are considerably smaller, and its shrine was located inside a village; the roughly contemporary architecture at Jericho is devoid of artistic merit or large-scale sculpture; and Çatalhöyük, perhaps the most famous of all Anatolian Neolithic villages, is 2,000 years younger.

*  &gt;Schmidt has engaged in some speculation regarding the belief systems of the groups that created Göbekli Tepe, based on comparisons with other shrines and settlements. He assumes shamanic practices and suggests that the T-shaped pillars may represent mythical creatures, perhaps ancestors, whereas he sees a fully articulated belief in gods only developing later in Mesopotamia, associated with extensive temples and palaces. This corresponds well with an ancient Sumerian belief that agriculture, animal husbandry, and weaving had been brought to mankind from the sacred mountain Du-Ku, which was inhabited by Annuna deities, very ancient gods without individual names. Schmidt identifies this story as a primeval oriental myth that preserves a partial memory of the emerging Neolithic.[26] It is also apparent that the animal and other images give no indication of organized violence, i.e., there are no depictions of hunting raids or wounded animals, and the pillar carvings ignore game on which the society mainly subsisted, like deer, in favor of formidable creatures such as lions, snakes, spiders, and scorpions.

*  &gt;At present, Göbekli Tepe raises more questions for archaeology and prehistory than it answers. We do not know how a force large enough to construct, augment, and maintain such a substantial complex was mobilized and rewarded or fed in the conditions of pre-sedentary society. We cannot ""read"" the pictograms, and do not know for certain what meaning the animal reliefs had for visitors to the site; the variety of fauna depicted, from lions and boars to birds and insects, makes any single explanation problematic. As there seems to be little or no evidence of habitation, and the animals pictured are mainly predators, the stones may have been intended to stave off evils through some form of magic representation; alternatively they may have served as totems.[29] ... Human burial may or may not have occurred at the site. The reason the complex was eventually backfilled remains unexplained. Until more evidence is gathered, it is difficult to deduce anything certain about the originating culture or the site's significance.

This might be too much to put in the body of the post but I figured some people might not feel like loading the wiki page and I feel that cherry picked some of the best parts for a discussion.  There are several other settlements or ruins that are close in age and relative proximity that can be worth mentioning but nothing comes close to the level of detail and execution at Göbekli Tepe.

Astronomers have known for years that something seems to be pulling our Milky Way and tens of thousands of other galaxies toward itself at a breakneck 22 million kilometers (14 million miles) per hour. But they couldn’t pinpoint exactly what or where it is.
A huge volume of space that includes the Milky Way and super-clusters of galaxies is flowing towards a mysterious, gigantic unseen mass that mass astronomers have dubbed ""The Great Attractor,"" some 250 million light years from our Solar System.

The stones are standing on a rise a short distance to the east of Georgia Highway 77 (Hartwell Highway), and are visible from that road. Small signs beside the highway indicate the turnoff for the Guidestones, which is identified by a street sign as ""Guidestones Rd."" It is located on the highest point in Elbert County. 

 A message consisting of a set of ten guidelines or principles is engraved on the Georgia Guidestones in eight different languages, one language on each face of the four large upright stones. Moving clockwise around the structure from due north, these languages are: English, Spanish, Swahili, Hindi, Hebrew, Arabic, Chinese and Russian.

A radio operator aboard the troubled vessel reported the deaths of the ship's captain as well as all of its officers, and possibly the entire crew, before sending out further garbled messages and finally declaring himself in dying condition with the words ""I die"". When the Silver Star crew located and boarded the apparently undamaged Ourang Medan in a rescue attempt, the ship was found littered with corpses (including the carcass of a dog) in what appeared to be terrified postures, with no survivors and no visible signs of injuries on the dead bodies. A fire then broke out in the ship's cargo hold, forcing the boarding parties to evacuate the Dutch freighter, thus preventing any further investigation. Soon after the Ourang Medan was observed it exploded and sank, forever to keep its secret.

An unidentified man is found dead on an Australian beach with no obvious cause of death. 

In a fake pocket sewn into his trousers is found a small piece of paper with the words ""Tamam Shud"". A phrase found on the last page of The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.  A photograph of the scrap of paper was sent to interstate police and released to the public, leading a man to reveal he had found a very rare first edition copy of Edward FitzGerald's translation of The Rubaiyat, published in 1859 by Whitcombe and Tombs in New Zealand, in the back seat of his unlocked car that had been parked in Jetty Road Glenelg about a week or two before the body was found.

In the back of the book were faint pencil markings of five lines of capital letters with the second line struck out. The strike out is now considered significant with its similarity to the fourth line possibly indicating a mistake and thus, possible proof the letters are code:

WRGOABABD

~~MLIAOI~~

WTBIMPANETP

MLIABOAIAQC

ITTMTSAMSTGAB

Also found in the back of the book was an unlisted telephone number belonging to a former nurse who lived in Moseley St, Glenelg, around 400 metres north of the location where the body was found. The woman said that while she was working at Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney during World War II she owned a copy of The Rubaiyat but in 1945, at the Clifton Gardens Hotel in Sydney, had given it to an army lieutenant named Alfred Boxall who was serving in the Water Transport Section of the Australian Army.

Police believed that Boxall was the dead man until they found Boxall alive with his copy of The Rubaiyat (a 1924 Sydney edition), complete with ""Tamam Shud"" on the last page. Boxall was now working in the maintenance section at the Randwick Bus Depot (where he had worked before the war) and was unaware of any link between the dead man and him.

* Who was the dead man?
* What was the link between the dead man and Taman Shud?
* Was he a spy?
* What was the link if any between the dead man and the nurse?
* What dead he die of?
* What does the code mean?

So many unanswered questions!

1373825030.0,65,self.UnresolvedMysteries,1iabqi,Travis Walton,Riley_The_Thief,93,28,37,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1iabqi/travis_walton/,"There isn't any discussion on him (or did I miss it?). On November 5, 1975, Travis Walton and his friends went camping. While camping, they saw a bright light, so they went to investigate it. What they saw was a hovering saucer. Travis Walton went to investigate further, even though his friends strayed back. But when he got too close, the saucer shot a beam of light at Walton. Walton was suspended into the air, then dropped to the ground. His friends thought he was dead, and they feared for their own lives, so they ran away.

But after awhile, they decided to go back. When they came back, the saucer and Walton was gone. They went back to town and told the police. At first, the police did not believe them and thought they killed Walton. The group agreed to a polygraph test, and they answered a variety of questions, ranging from ""Did you harm Walton?"" to ""Did you actually see a UFO?"" The men answered truthfully, and the test concluded that they were telling the truth. The police said that the polygraph test **was** conclusive.

But this is where it gets truly weird. Almost a week later, November 10, a phone call was made to Walton's sister. His sister's husband picked up the phone call, and the caller said in a weak voice (according to the husband) ""This is Travis. I'm at a phone booth at the Heber gas station, and I need help. Come and get me."" At first, the husband thought the caller was another prankster, and was about to hang up until the caller spoke again, saying in an almost hysterical and screaming voice ""It's me, Grant … I'm hurt, and I need help badly. You come and get me."" The husband believed the voice to be genuinely in panic, so he believed him.

Walton was reportedly found at the Heber gas station, collapsed in a phone booth. Walton looked thin, malnourished, pale, and had not shaven. He was picked up by his sibling and his sister's husband. According to them, Walton seemed panicky and anxious. When Walton returned home, his mother said that Walton could not eat. When Walton tried to eat, he would vomit.

When Walton was told he was missing for a week, he was stunned. Walton thought he had only been gone for a few hours.

Walton was sent to have a medical exam, and he had a red spot on his right elbow that was consistent with a hypodermic injection. However, analysis of Walton's urine showed that it had low ketones. If Walton did not eat any food while he was gone, according to what Walton said, then his body would've broken down his fat to sustain him, which would've caused his urine to have a lot of ketones.

Walton reported that after approaching the UFO, the last thing he saw was the beam of light that struck him. When he woke, Walton said he was on a reclined bed. A bright light was shone on him and the air was heavy and wet. He was in pain, and had trouble breathing, but his first thought was that he was in a hospital.

As his faculties returned, Walton says he realized he was surrounded by three figures, each wearing a sort of orange jumpsuit. The figures were not human. Walton described the beings as typical of the so-called Greys which feature in some abduction accounts: ""shorter than five feet, and they had bald heads, no hair. Their heads were domed, very large. They looked like fetuses [...] They had large eyes — enormous eyes — almost all brown, without much white in them. The creepiest thing about them were those eyes … they just stared through me."" Their ears, noses and mouths ""seemed real small, maybe just because their eyes were so huge.""

Walton related that he feared for his safety and got to his feet, and shouted at the creatures to stay away. He grabbed a glasslike cylinder from a nearby shelf and tried to break its tip to create a makeshift knife, but found the object unbreakable, so instead waved it at the creatures as a weapon. The trio of creatures left him in the room.

(I'll stop with the UFO bits. It goes on for a while. Don't want to make this too long!)

After everything settled down, Walton returned to normal living and wrote a book on his experience.

The Travis Walton mystery is considered the best proof for alien abductions. It remains as one of the best-known instances of alien abduction.

So, /r/unresolvedmysteries, what do you think? Did Travis Walton get abducted, or was this an elaborate plank? I don't think it's a prank, because why would someone purposely starve themselves? Maybe this is a government cover up!",,False,,t5_2wvvc,False,,,True,t3_1iabqi,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1iabqi/travis_walton/,

On the afternoon of 20th August 1966 a young man aged 18 called Jorge da Costa Alves was flying a kite on the Morro do Vintém (Vintém Hill) in Niterói, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
He found two male bodies and warned the authorities. The police waited until the next day to collect the bodies and investigate, as it was already dark and the area was well known for being dangerous due to the presence of drug dealers.
The Morro do Vintém had a difficult terrain and was hard to access. It was the place where some locals allegedly witnessed UFO sightings.
With the help of firefighters, a team of police officers led by marshal Oscar Nunes arrived at the scene on the next day, 21 August.

The bodies were next to each other, slightly covered by grass. They were wearing suits, lead masks and water-proof coats.
There was no sign of violence to the bodies or to the surrounding area. Next to the bodies, the police found an empty bottle of water and a packet containing two towels.
The masks were a type typically used for protection from radiation, and it is these masks that have given the case its name.

Police found a small notebook stating:
""16:30 estar no local determinado. 18:30 ingerir cápsulas, após efeito proteger metais aguardar sinal máscara""
Which translates to:
""16:30 be at the agreed place. 18:30 swallow capsules, after effect protect metals, wait for signal, mask"".

On August 17, they left their city, Campos dos Goytacazes, stating that they intended to buy some materials for use at their work.
They took a bus and arrived in Niterói at 14:30. They bought the impermeable coats at a small shop and the bottle of water at a bar.
The waitress who served them on the bar stated that Miguel seemed very nervous and looked at his watch frequently.
From the bar, they went directly to the place where they were later found dead.

Nobody ever came forward with any information regarding the strange deaths, the case remains unresolved.

By all accounts, Edwards was a straight-laced, hard working man who was not prone to wild flights of fancy or belief in the paranormal.

Nevertheless, as the exhausted Edwards drove down an isolated stretch of road through the mostly derelict industrial district where the Risley atomic energy complex was located, something utterly unbelievable snared his attention… something that would challenge his understanding of reality.

Edwards claimed that he first spied what he thought was a “man climbing,” but he quickly realized that he was looking at a gargantuan, humanoid figure lumbering down the steep embankment adjacent to the nuclear facility. The startled engineer immediately hit the brakes and his van slowed to a halt near the curb of the road some 50-feet away from the hulking humanoid, which was now illuminated by his headlights.

Edwards stared in astonishment at this bipedal beast — which he would later dub the “Silver Man” — as it lurched down the hill with its arms outstretched, utilizing strange, stiff-legged movements, like someone who was born without knee joints.

Other guests noticed that as the night wore on, Edward appeared to become ill. The manager of the underground parking garage claimed that Edward was staggering to his Oldsmobile before he left and that Stephania was crying and asking him not to drive home. Edward accidentally hit the garage door before exiting and he was last seen driving the wrong way down Michigan Avenue.
*(Reference from [Listverse](http://listverse.com/2013/06/05/10-couples-who-mysteriously-vanished/))*

There is much speculation and possibilites of what might have happened.
Here is a few from the Listverse article mentioned above.
&gt;Authorities initially theorized that Edward might have become disoriented and drove off a nearby bridge into the Chicago River. However, an extensive search of the water turned up no trace of the couple or their vehicle. In 1980, a full clean-up of the river produced twelve vehicles, but none of them were the Andrewses’ Oldsmobile. The case took a different turn in 1994 when an informant told police that Edward and Stephania had been murdered that night by gang members, who placed the couple’s bodies in their car and submerged it in a pond near Green Oaks. However, a search of the pond turned up nothing. After more than 40 years, it’s still unknown what happened to Edward and Stephania Andrews that night.

**My Opinions From Research**
Inside of their house there was nothing missing or out of place.
All of their stocks, bonds, and credit cards were not touched since their disappearance.
They were described as a happy couple at the time.

Looking into an article it talks of the man who reported they were in the lake/pond, was mostly false.
But, it also says this account.
&gt;But the search was called off in the late afternoon and suspended indefinitely after divers located a large object several feet deep in the muck, but could not determine what it was.
If the truck was there, and was buried, it could very possibly be that.
I am not sure why we haven't gone back and checked, or why we didn't make an attempt to check then.
We didn't have the technology then, and sure the case has gone cold. But this is the main lead we have currently.

Amy Billig vanished in 1974 while hitchhiking to her father's office. A few days later, sixteen-year-old twins, Charles and Larry Glasser claimed to have kidnapped her and asked for a $30,000 ransom, but the police discovered this was a ruse and arrested them for extortion. Her mother, Susan Billig, recieved tips that she might have been kidnapped by a motorcycle gang and taken cross-country. Susan followed all these tips all the way to England on what was deemed a wild goose chase. Another claim was that she died from a drug overdose and her body was dumped to alligators in the Florida Everglades. Some time after Amy vanished, her camera was found at the Wildwood exit on the Florida Turnpike and surrendered to the police. Many of its photos were overexposed with the few decent ones having no further clue to her whereabouts.

The photo depicts exactly what he was wearing on the day he was found. He was wearing a baseball jersey - white with red sleeves - brown cargo pants, beige socks and brown sport shoes when he was found. 

He had on a ""Lord of the Rings"" style ring with Elvish writing on it. He was wearing a silver name bracelet that had links added to make it longer, and it also had ""Michel"" engraved on it. He also had a green elastic around his left bicep.

Info copy and pasted from [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hessdalen_light): ""The Hessdalen Light is an unexplained light usually seen in the Hessdalen valley in the municipality of Holtålen in Sør-Trøndelag county, Norway. 

Unusual lights have been reported here since 1940s or earlier. Especially high activity of Hessdalen lights took place from December 1981 until the summer of 1984 when lights were observed 15 to 20 times per week. The frequency of the lights caused a gathering of numerous tourists staying there overnight to see the phenomenon.[1] Since then, the activity has decreased and now the lights are observed some 10 - 20 times per year.
The Hessdalen light most often is a bright, white or yellow light of unknown origin standing or floating above the ground level. Sometimes the light can be seen for more than one hour. There are several other types of unexplained lights observed in the Hessdalen valley.[2]""

People have actually been looking into this for awhile, and [Project Hessdalen](http://www.hessdalen.org/index_e.shtml) is a website dedicated to finding out what is causing these lights. There are some photos and videos there, but I have to warn you guys that it hasn't been updated a whole lot. The most recent pics added are from 2011. Doing a quick Google search, I found some photos of the lights from [November 2012.](http://www.thetruthbehindthescenes.org/?p=28821)

[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VVgQ8Vkx3Ug) is a video (same one posted on that Askreddit thread) that talks a bit about the lights. 

My first guess was that it might be something natural that science just can't explain now, but the part about finding chunks of turf being removed with ""laser precision"" makes me wonder if something else is happening. The thought of it being alien life forms taking sample of Earth material is kind of outlandish, but an interesting possibility.

The Jamison Family had a lot of security cameras setup around their home and Bobby had been making claims that he had been seeing angels and such. Sherilynn also suffered from Bipolar Disorder IIRC. Police believe that Bobby and Sherilynn may have experienced delusions and paranoia due to substance abuse.

Their abandoned truck was found by hunters, but it didn't look like a case where they vanished on their own accord. Their dog was found in the truck malnourished after days of going without food or water. Police also discovered their IDs, wallets and thirty thousand dollars in cash. There didn't appear to be any struggle near the car and a notebook written by Sherilynn was located in the vehicle that contained information suggesting that she was clearly unhappy with the marriage and despised her husband. 

This is the last known [photograph](http://www.truecrimereport.com/Madyson-Jamison.jpg) of Madyson that was located on a mobile phone locked inside their truck.

A worldwide manhunt found no one who could identify him.

I didn't notice any talk about this case, probably since it is so old and relatively little known -- not to mention quite believably explained, but I won't lose ""hope"".

Here is a wikipedia and a short, self penned run-down of the events (wikipedia page has more facts listed):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flannan_Isles#Mystery_of_1900

The facts go, three lighthouse keepers disappeared from their post on the Flannan Isles (in the outer Hebrides) sometime in December 1900, last log entries were made on the 15th. Severe storms had raged the month, and the regular supply ships hadn't made it there, only to find the place curiously abandoned and unlit on boxing day (26th) December 1900. Reportedly there was no sign of violence of any kind inside, save for an overthrown chair and a clock that had stopped. Outside there was severe damage -- apparently from the storm, and reported in the log before the keepers disappeared. Bent railings, displaced turf and a large rock that had moved.

It was theorized that the keepers had for some reason ventured out during the storm, and been washed out to sea. Unsurprisingly the story sparked the imaginations of the people, lending itself to several typical (murder) and bizarre (sea monsters, ghosts) explanations.

Thus far no damning evidence has been found, and it is highly unlikely ever will, considering the almost 113 years that have passed since.

Nevertheless, it still keeps old Lovecraft readers like Yours Truly interested -- logical fallacy or not, if you can't prove it wasn't a sea monster, it probably was in my books.",,False,,t5_2wvvc,False,,,True,t3_1fatuw,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1fatuw/flannan_islands_incident_1900/,

03/29/11

On June 30, 1999, sheriff’s officers in St. Louis, Missouri discovered the body of 41-year-old Ricky McCormick. He had been murdered and dumped in a field. The only clues regarding the homicide were two encrypted notes found in the victim’s pants pockets.

Despite extensive work by our Cryptanalysis and Racketeering Records Unit (CRRU), as well as help from the American Cryptogram Association, the meanings of those two coded notes remain a mystery to this day, and Ricky McCormick’s murderer has yet to face justice.

“We are really good at what we do,” said CRRU chief Dan Olson, “but we could use some help with this one.”

In fact, Ricky McCormick’s encrypted notes are one of CRRU’s top unsolved cases. “Breaking the code,” said Olson, “could reveal the victim’s whereabouts before his death and could lead to the solution of a homicide. Not every cipher we get arrives at our door under those circumstances.”

They discovered a blood-encrusted trap door by the dining table leading to what was called the 'Slaughter Pen.' Nine bodies were found buried in the orchard with their skulls bashed in. Police surmised that the men would bash the skulls of travelers in while they were eating, drop them into the Slaughter Pen, and then slit their throats to ensure death. They then stole money and horses from the dead and buried them. Although several false arrests had been made and several theories as to the Benders' whereabouts floated around, no one really knows what became of this serial killer family.

The unknown killer is credited with attacking eight people, five which were killed within ten weeks, usually three weeks apart. The attacks happened on weekends between February 22, 1946 through May 3, 1946. Contrary to popular belief, the killer did not attack during a full moon but did strike late at night. The murders sent the town in a state of fear throughout the summer. 

The first three sets of victims were young couples out after dark.  When young couples stopped going out after dark (and who can blame them), the Phantom Killer attacked a couple in their home.  

The story was made into an influential but now largely forgotten proto-Slasher called ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"".  (Not bad, btw - chilling attack scenes, but badly-handled comic relief.)

It is sometimes called the ""Sweat Lodge Incident"". Three people died. If you want to know more, or are unfamiliar, you can read about it here:

Now, you may know based on previous readings or your own experience in time that this self-help guru was responsible for the deaths of three of his followers. But, many do not know the story of another follower who died while attending one of his events: Colleen Conaway. I hate to plagiarize, and cannot put it together as well as the source below. But I will try to summarize it as best I can.

[Stealing Hope: James Ray's Deadly Legacy](http://spiritualityisnoexcuse.wordpress.com/2012/07/25/stealing-hope-james-rays-deadly-legacy/)

Basically, Colleen was lured into James Arthur Ray's organization when she happened upon a free seminar offered by him. Ray’s events are extremely intense, highly confronting and extremely dangerous. Participants’ physical and mental defenses are systematically dismantled. It is demanded of them that they go deeply into strong emotions and explore issues right back to their childhood, and share it with the group. Neither Ray nor any of his staff are in any way qualified to deal with people on this level, but they wade in there anyway.

Sleep deprivation is used, along with dangerous exercises that have frequently caused injuries like broken bones. Ray’s staff are always there to “encourage people” to “play full on” (one of Ray’s favorite expressions). Food and toilet breaks are severely restricted and policed by staff, with offenders often humiliated before the group.

People who don’t “play full on” in Ray’s events are singled out for humiliation before the group. People who Ray for some reason doesn’t like are also humiliated “for their own good”.

Months after attending her first seminar, Colleen began to attend more and more seminars, spending money she didnt have to go all around the United States to take part in these events. One event was in St. Cloud, MN :: The other in Chicago. At the Chicago event Colleen participated in the damaging ‘board-breaking’ exercises that have been reported elsewhere. She came back injured :: and changed. Suddenly she seemed more serious. She eliminated all ‘negativity’ from her life :: filtering out news and events that weren’t in conformity with her new “Harmonic” views.

After Colleen’s death Lynn [her sister] found that she had been filling out 3×5 cards with what looked like James Ray’s sayings or directives. They were all over Colleen’s house :: Hundreds of them :: Along with spiral notebooks full of similar gibberish. Colleen had been directed to keep a list of her ‘old limiting views’ and her new ‘harmonic views.’ Lynn sounded anguished recalling her feelings at seeing that Colleen had lined though many of the values that 2008 Colleen would have treasured. Scratching off pieces of herself :: one at time :: replaced with empty lies.

At the event in which she died, Colleen refused to ""play full on"" for the ""homelessness exercise"" in which participants leave their money, cell phones, and ID behind. They dress up in tattered clothes and pretend to be homeless people for several hours in downtown San Diego.

Colleen, it seems, refused to put on the “homeless” clothes and went in the clothes she had on. This would not have gone unnoticed by either Ray or his staff. And Colleen appears to have traveled in the same bus as James Ray. It is reasonable, based on past experiences of others, that Ray was angry with Colleen and probably humiliated and punished her for this type of rebellion. 

They arrived at the Horton Plaza Shopping Mall some time after 1 pm. The participants dispersed, and Ray, it started settling himself in for a nice relaxed lunch.

At 1.43 pm, Colleen climbed over the railing in the mall, three levels up, and fell.

At 1.54 pm, staff member Greg Hartle (a member of Ray's inner circle) tweeted: ""Just witnessed a woman jump several stories down onto pure concrete. I gotta say it was disturbing. I’m sending her love right now. -Greg Hartle""

James Arthur Ray was aware of the event, but said nothing, even when police arrived. At At 2.04 pm Ray tweeted: ""Eating lunch w/ my dream (-team, i.e. volunteers &amp; staff) while CAW (Creating Absolute Wealth) participants are having a life changing experience. James Ray""

The situation gets worse from here, with Ray and his inner circle attempting to cover up any knowledge of Colleen's ""suicide"". They made called to her cell phone asking her to return to the retreat (acting like she had gone off on her own). Those unaware of Colleen's death would ask when she would be coming back, and be told to shut up and stop talking about her. Staff also destroyed Colleen's diary to keep whatever happened to her at the retreat from being known. 

Colleen's family was alerted of her death as the members of the retreat were celebrating with a end of seminar party and celebration. No one from Ray's organization ever contacted her family, and they refused to refund any money to her family.

1373949038.0,44,self.UnresolvedMysteries,1ie4mp,Long Island City Torso Mystery,fwizard226,57,13,20,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1ie4mp/long_island_city_torso_mystery/,"I stumbled on this fascinating unsolved mystery while doing genealogy research. I’ll start out with a brief summary of some of the facts I’ve gathered, and then move on to the personal connection and speculation.

**The Body**
The head and torso of a young woman were found on the morning of October 22 1921 in a pond in Long Island City. A green belt was knotted around her neck, the head covered with a man’s undershirt and two outer shirts, and the head and body were wrapped in blue and white oilcloth. The torso was wrapped with a chemise and silk dress lining, torn from blue serge fabric.  She was thought to be around 20 years old, likely poor, and probably of German or Polish decent. The police speculated that she was killed elsewhere and driven to the pond, where she was likely dumped on Friday night. 

**Clues**
A few witnesses came forward.  These include:

- Three witnesses saw a man in uniform carrying a heavy bundle Tuesday night near the pond (although it is noted that this may be unrelated, since the girl appeared to be dead only 48 hours).

- A man tells police he saw a man in a uniform with a peaked cap (possibly chauffeur livery) draw a bundle from a large touring car on Tuesday night.  This does coincide with the earlier statement from the three previous witnesses.

- A couple saw a touring car and movie van on the Wednesday night before the body was found. The touring car had its lights on, illuminating men working inside the van; the car put its lights out as the couple passed.  When the couple returned the car and the van were gone, but there was a pool of water like the van had been washed out. 

**Possible Identities**
Here’s where I think the story gets really interesting.  Multiple people came to identify the body.  Here are two that I found interesting:

- A woman came in claiming to be Mrs. Elizabeth Richards.  She claimed the body was that of Bertha Baker (or Becker), who lived with her in 1919.  Mrs. Richards said Bertha had an iron cross and the initials “B.B” tattooed on her right leg above the knee—which interested police since the legs were still missing at this point. Later, however, Mr. Richards tells police the woman who claimed to be Elizabeth Richards was an imposter, since his wife was in the hospital.  The real identity of the woman was never revealed.  When the legs were finally discovered, there were no tattoos.

- Arnold A. Wagstaff identifies the body as that of his wife, Mary Agnes (Minnie).  He was accompanied by his wife’s sister and four other friends, who also identified the body as Mary Agnes.  Wagstaff, a chauffeur, said Mary Agnes would often stay out late, past when he would return home from work.  She left him in July, leaving a note that said she would be back for her clothes (she never got them).  She was around town with an Italian man who worked at a fruit stand. Wagstaff last saw her on August 19th, and he urged her to return home.  She refused.  
 
Okay, there’s a *whole lot* more I could add, but for the sake of space I’m going to move on. Please check out the articles I’m linking at the end for a lot of the other clues and possible identifications I’m leaving out here.

 The [article about Arnold A. Wagstaff](http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A07E0D8103CE533A2575AC2A9669D946095D6CF) is what interests me the most, and started my research.  He is my great grandfather, which was confirmed by both census records and my grandfather’s brother.  So here starts my speculation. What’s interesting to me is that this article claims that Wagstaff’s ID of the victim clears up the question of the victim’s identity, but subsequent articles do not mention Wagstaff or Mary Agnes at all (or at least that I’ve been able to find), which is confusing to me.  No mentions of even why police may have moved on.  The article also mentions that Wagstaff works as a chauffeur (many of the witnesses thought they may have seen a touring car and chauffeur with a bundle near the crime scene), and it sounds from the article like he may have had reason to feel spurned by his wife.  

Some other things I can add from census data. In 1923, Arnold A. Wagstaff married to Edith Peterson (my great-grandmother).  Although I haven’t been able to track down marriage records yet, the article states that Arnold and Mary Agnes married in 1920, so I’m not sure what exactly happened with Mary Agnes that the marriage officially dissolved (again, I need more research here). Census data also shows that by 1925 Arnold was a patrolman with the New York Police Department.  Additionally, as far as pure family rumor goes, my grandfather and his brother have both said that their father was a mean, violent man.  All of this I’ve found about him makes me…a little suspicious.

So to bring this all to a conclusion, [this 1931 Brooklyn Daily Star article](http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2015/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Star/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Star%201931/Brooklyn%20NY%20Daily%20Star%201931%20-%200570.pdf) states that the body was never identified and the murderers were never found. If you’ve gotten through all of this, I hope you at least found it as fascinating as I do!  Do check out the articles below, like I said, there’s a whole lot more that there isn’t room to mention.  I would love to hear what you guys think, and if anyone can dig up any more information.

Data from a Taos Hum study suggests that a minimum of 2% and perhaps as many as 11% of the population could detect the Taos Hum and the Daily Telegraph in 1996 likewise reported a figure of 2% of people hearing the Bristol Hum.

The tree-covered island is one of about 360 small islands in Mahone Bay and rises to a maximum of 35 feet (11 m) above sea level. Located 200 metres from shore and connected to the mainland by a modern causeway, the island is privately owned, and advance permission is required for any visitation.

Oak Island is noted as the location of the so-called Money Pit and the site of over 200 years of treasure hunting. Repeated excavations have reported layers of apparently man-made artifacts as deep as 31 metres (102 ft), but ended in collapsed excavations and flooding. Critics argue that there is no treasure and that the pit is a natural phenomenon, likely a sinkhole.

There has been wide-ranging speculation amongst enthusiasts as to who originally dug the pit and what it might contain. Later accounts say that oak platforms were discovered every 10 feet (3.0 m), but the earliest accounts simply say that ""marks"" of some type were found at these places. They also say there were ""tool marks"" or pick scrapes on the walls of the money pit and that the dirt was noticeably loose and not as hard packed as the surrounding soil. One expedition said they found the flood tunnel at 90 feet, and that it was lined with flat stones. However, Robert Dunfield (a trained geologist) wrote that he carefully examined the walls of the re-excavated pit and was unable to locate any evidence of this tunnel.

The cipher stone, which one researcher is said to have translated to read ""Forty feet below two million pounds is buried"", was allegedly last seen in the early 20th century (exact dates are a topic of controversy). Some accounts state that Smith used it as a fireback in his fireplace, while others claim it was last seen as a doorstep in a Halifax bookbinder's shop. The accuracy of the translation, whether the symbols as commonly depicted are accurate, or if they meant anything at all, remains disputed. Barry Fell, the author of the controversial books America B.C. and Saga America, was sent a copy of the inscription by the chief archivist of the Nova Scotia Archives in the late 1970s. Fell, whose publications consisted largely of alleged translations of inscriptions on stones found elsewhere in North America, concluded that the symbols were similar to the Coptic alphabet and when translated implied that the people needed to remember their God or else they would perish.

Man-made structures under Oak Island do in fact exist as discussed in many books, including a book written by Lee Lamb, daughter of Robert Restall. Whether these structures were constructed by people hiding a treasure, or are the remains of prior excavation attempts, is unknown.

It is named after the book dealer Wilfrid Voynich, who purchased it in 1912.

Some pages are missing, but the current version comprises about 240 vellum pages, most with illustrations. Much of the manuscript resembles herbal manuscripts of the 1500s, seeming to present illustrations and information about plants and their possible uses for medical purposes. However, most of the plants do not match known species, and the manuscript's script and language remain unknown. Possibly some form of encrypted ciphertext, the Voynich manuscript has been studied by many professional and amateur cryptographers, including American and British codebreakers from both World War I and World War II. It has defied all decipherment attempts, becoming a famous case of historical cryptology. The mystery surrounding it has excited the popular imagination, making the manuscript a subject of both fanciful theories and novels. None of the many speculative solutions proposed over the last hundred years has yet been independently verified.""

She had just finished filming a bit part in the movie Young Man With a Horn (tee hee!), among numerous other small roles, and it might just have been a matter of time before she'd make it big. Or not. We'll never know, as fate had other plans for her. One October day in 1949, she set off to meet her ex-husband about child support and was never seen again. Her purse appeared two days later, untouched and exactly as cashless as it had been (she didn't carry money -- the investigation ruled out robbery). The only thing inside was a cryptic note:
""Kirk, Can't wait any longer. Going to see Dr. Scott. It will work best this way while mother is away.""

Here is my theory: Dr. Kirk was taking too long to give her an abortion so she went to Dr. Scott. He probably wasn't a real Dr. and had malicious intent all along, or he accidently killed her during the procedure and obviously needed \to keep her death a secret. She obviously felt it would be best to get the procedure out the way since her mother was gone to eliminate any controversy.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto#Satoshi_Nakamoto

His involvement in the original bitcoin protocol does not appear to extend past mid-2010. There was an investigation, where using textual analysis, the phrase ""...computationally impractical to reverse"" was found in both a patent application and bitcoin's whitepaper, linking 3 persons authoring the patent to bitcoin. They have denied any involvement, but so far that is the most elegant solution.

I would like to offer mine. Based on the original code's complexity, it is safe to assume Nakamoto is rather a group than just one person. An analyses of his posting times indicated that he didn't post between 1-5 am EST, thus possible East Coast residence. There are lots of US government agencies based on the East Coast obviously. Also, there are 1.1 million early Bitcoins never been used, just sitting in wallets, collecting dust. This is one of the most interesting aspects of Bitcoin, and my theory would explain it.

If we put these facts together, one can theorize that Bitcoin is/was a US government experiment. So let's see if my theory answers questions:

1. Why? A government social experience for various reasons:

a/ To see if people are receptive to the idea and if so, how fast.

b/ To fund agents abroad.

c/ To follow and capture criminals/terrorists, once bitcoin is widely used.

d/ Cryptocurrency might be the future, they might as well start it, so they can have control over it.

e/ Whatever they discover through the process the agency can use it for cryptology.

f/ If they crash the market at a later date, that would put virtual currencies harder to use in the future.
/etc.etc.

2. How? The NSA has a huge stuff with top notch brain power. Using their work time and their salaries they had the time, talent and indication to write complex codes. For one individual to do so it is much harder, should have involved full time coding...

3. Why did Nakamoto disappear? Once the thing started to take off and there were enough enthusiasts who did the coding, there was no point in advertising US government involvement.

4. Why the 1+ million coins haven't been used or even transferred? If they were mined on government computers using government employees, they are government property, thus they can not be sold for personal gains. Also, that is currently 10% of the existing coins, a large enough amount to bring the whole project down, if they enter the market with it.
   Had the original creator wanted to popularize the bitcoins, he would have given these coins away at the early stage, so more people could have been owners/users. Had he wanted to be rich, he should have sold at east some part of it, because nobody really knows just how high the coins' value can go. Some of the early coins also could have been lost, but I don't think 1.1 million of them...



   Anyhow, these are just conjectures nothing solid evidence, but sure they explain a few questions, what the previous investigation's finding didn't....

Smith and Hickock are still considered the most viable suspects, but the case remains unsolved.

&gt;
In its random violence, the murders of the Clutter family of Kansas and the Walker family of Osprey were eerily similar. A .22-caliber firearm was used in both slayings. Both unremarkable families lived in remote ranch houses and had no known enemies.

Many other details seemed to point to the two killers, as well.

Documents signed by Hickock and Smith put them in Florida at the time of the Walker shootings, and the pair drove the type of car for which the Walkers were shopping earlier on the day of their deaths. Witnesses in Sarasota and Arcadia, where the Walkers were raised, placed the killers in the area after the Herald-Tribune published a photo of the pair and asked if anyone had seem them.

Christine Walker, 24, was raped and beaten before being shot to death on Dec. 19, 1959, collapsing in a jumble of her petticoats in the hallway of her clapboard house, in what was then scrubby, palmetto-covered cattle country.

Detectives saved her clothing as evidence, including underwear with her rapist's semen. As technology improved, that sample yielded DNA that so far has failed to match her husband and 24 suspects, now including Hickock and Smith.

Deputies know this much: Christine Walker — Christine Myers when she was a comely majorette at DeSoto High School — was killed alone in her home.

Her husband and children arrived a few minutes later to an apparent ambush.

Cliff Walker, 25, was shot in the eye as he entered the house, dying instantly and falling backward, his white cowboy hat still on his head.

Jimmie, 3, the spitting image of Cliff in his dungarees and little cowboy hat, was shot in the head and died at his father's feet. Curly-haired Debbie was shot but didn't die immediately, leading her killer to draw a few inches of water in the family bathtub and drown her. She was found facedown in the water the next morning.

Detectives early in the investigation ruled out Hickock and Smith based on polygraph results and fingerprints taken after their Dec. 30 arrest in Las Vegas.

But McGath noted that lie detector tests of the day often were invalid, and the fingerprint found on a faucet might actually be a palm print.

Richey Edwards was a member of the Manic Street Preachers who disappeared on the 1st February 1995. In the two weeks before his disappearance, Edwards withdrew £200 a day from his bank account, which totalled £2800 by the day of the scheduled flight. He checked out of the Embassy Hotel in Bayswater Road, London at seven in the morning, and then drove to his apartment in Cardiff, Wales. In the two weeks that followed he was apparently spotted in the Newport passport office, and the Newport bus station.

On February 7, a taxi driver from Newport supposedly picked up Edwards from the King's Hotel in Newport, and drove him around the valleys, including Blackwood (Edwards' home as a child). The passenger got off at the Severn View service station near Aust and paid the £68 fare in cash. On February 14, Edwards' Vauxhall Cavalier received a parking ticket at the Severn View service station and on February 17, the vehicle was reported as abandoned. Police discovered the battery to be flat, with evidence that the car had been lived in.

Due to the service station's proximity to the Severn Bridge (which has been a renowned suicide location in the past) it was widely believed that he took his own life by jumping from the bridge. 

While his family had the option of declaring him legally dead from 2002, they had chosen not to for many years, and his status remained open as a missing person, until 23 November 2008, when he became officially ""presumed dead"".

When no one heard from them for several days, Camden’s mother came to visit their loft. The couple was not there and aside from their running shoes, a pair of house keys and Camden’s bag, all of their personal items had been left behind. After they were reported missing, suspicion immediately fell on their landlord, Robert Rodriguez, who was reportedly having financial problems at the time and wanted to increase his tenants’ rent by an exorbitant amount.

Rodriguez had threatened to turn off the building’s heat if the tenants did not agree to the rent increase, but on the day she disappeared, Camden presented him with a signed petition. The tenants all stated they would withhold their rent payments if Rodriguez followed through on his threat. Right after Camden and Michael went missing, Rodriguez would himself disappear for two weeks without explanation, and he was later sentenced to six years in prison for larceny, tax fraud and credit card fraud. Rodriguez has since been released and though rumours persist that he may have been responsible for the disappearances, there is no evidence to prove this and he has always maintained his innocence. The whereabouts of Michael Sullivan and Camden Sylvia are still unknown. (Reference: http://listverse.com/2013/06/05/10-couples-who-mysteriously-vanished/)

The car had been pushed down an embankment along the Colonial Parkway. Investigators found that the women had rope burns and signs of strangulation before their throats were slashed. There was no evidence of sexual assault and no sign of a robbery. One of the women appears to have fought with the assailant. Investigators found a clump of hair in Thomas' fingers.

In **September of 1987**, David Knobling and Robin Edwards disappeared. Knobling's truck was found at the Ragged Island Wildlife Refuge near Smithfield, Virginia. The keys were in the ignition and the driver's side door was open. The radio was on, and Knobling's wallet was found on the dash. Several days later, their bodies washed up along the shore of the James River two miles downriver in the Ragged Island Refuge. They had both been shot to death. Knobling and Edwards were both partially clothed. Knobling was wearing jeans. The belt on Edwards' jeans was not fastened. Her bra was around her neck, under her blouse. Edwards' and Knoblings' underwear were both found in the truck. Police believe they were marched from the truck to the river where they were executed and dumped.

In **April of 1988**, Cassandra Lee Hailey and Richard Keith Call were reported missing after attending a party in Newport News. Call's car was found along the Colonial Parkway the next day. Again, the driver's side door was ajar and the keys were in the ignition. All of the couple's clothing was found in the backseat of the car, meaning they left the car completely nude. There was no sign of a struggle. Neither body has been found, but they are presumed dead.

In **October 1989**, hunters in the woods of New Kent County near the rest stop between Richmond and Williamsburg discovered the skeletal remains of Anna Marie Phelps and Daniel Lauer. They had last been seen on September 5, 1989. Lauer's gold 1973 Chevrolet Nova was found parked at the rest stop on the westbound side of I-64 that same day. Again, the keys were in the ignition and the gas tank was three-quarters full. Ms. Phelps' purse was in the car and some of Lauer's clothing was found in the car. Their bodies were found less than a mile from the rest stop. Although the state of decomposition made it difficult to determine a cause of death, police believe they were stabbed to death.

Other possibly linked victims are Brian Craig Pettinger, whose body was found in **February 1988** along the James River near Suffolk, and Laurie Ann Powell, who was discovered on April 2, 1988 along the James River. Ms. Powell had been stabbed multiple times.

In addition, the 1984 murders of Michael Margaret and Donna Hall bear a resemblance to the later ""Colonial Parkway killings."" On **August 21, 1984**, the bodies of Michael Margaret and his girlfriend, Donna Lynn Hall, were found in a wooded area just west of Richmond, Virginia. They were about 70 feet from Michael Margaret's Jeep. They had been stabbed multiple times and their throats had been slashed. There was no apparent motive. Margaret's Jeep, found near the bodies, held suitcases and a cooler. The couple had told friends that they were going camping.

**In January 2010**, the case was reopened by the FBI. There was a quite substantial set of evidence that had never been tested for DNA. Although initially indicating that DNA testing would be completed later in 2010, the testing continued through the fall of 2011. As of today, no one has been identified as the killer. Investigators have speculated that suspect might be a law enforcement officer or perhaps a rogue operative from the Central Intelligence Agency, which has a training facility nearby at Camp Peary in York County.

At the same time the FBI was reopening the case, the victims' families reached out to retired homicide detective Steven Spingola to conduct his own investigation. Spingola believes the murders are not the work of one murder, but rather two separate murderers. He links the murder of Thomas/Dowski to a similar murder of another lesbian couple (Lollie Winans and Julie Williams), who were found murdered 180 miles west in Shenandoah National Park in 1996. He even developed a profile of this killer. His findings were published in an article titled, ""Predators on the Parkway.""

There are no suspects, but is any story like this one complete with the requisite oddball? His name is Fred Atwell. He is a former deputy sheriff who has had a number of strange links to the Colonial Parkway killings. In 2009, Atwell helped identify crime scene photos related to the killings that had been inappropriately taken and used by the FBI. After that, however, Atwell's behavior got more and more erratic.

A while ago I watched ""The Imposter"", a documentary about a man from France in his twenties pretending to be missing Nicholas Barclay, who managed to get himself taken in by the kid's family until he was eventually found out by investigators. (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1966604/)[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1966604/]

In the film there is a strong undercurrent of there being something dodgy in connection to the missing boy's family, and a strong sense of people knowing more than they let on.

1366159873.0,42,self.UnresolvedMysteries,1ci1a8,Missing on Mount of the Holy Cross since 2005 - Michelle Vanek,13Coffees,52,10,14,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1ci1a8/missing_on_mount_of_the_holy_cross_since_2005/,"I thought about waiting to post about this until the anniversary of her disappearance on September 24, 2005, but since hiking season will be starting soon (would have already started if not for the late snowstorms this year) and many of us hikers still hold out hope that one day she will be found, I thought I'd post information regarding the disappearance of Michelle Vanek.  Most of this I'm posting from memory, but I'll include some sources for further reading.  I didn't know Michelle Vanek or her family personally, but the disappearance happened around the time I started hiking the mountains of Colorado and I often solo hike, so her disappearance haunts me.

For many of us that live in the Denver metro area, the mountains lying to the west are a constant reminder that there's something bigger than us that we haven't yet conquered.  They taunt us, they whisper to us that there's a place we haven't been and can't get to without considerable effort and personal sacrifice.  There are 54 mountains in Colorado that are over 14,000 feet. These are known as fourteeners, and are more challenging given the thinner air, the likelihood of experiencing altitude sickness, the distances one must climb to reach the summit, and the rapidly changing weather conditions above treeline. Some fourteeners require nothing more than a stroll up a path to summit, others require greater technical skill and fitness.  Top physical condition does not guarantee a hiker won't experience acute mountain sickness (AMS), and many hikers have had to turn back after experiencing headaches, nausea, shortness of breath, and an overwhelming urge to just sit down and not move. Every year there are deaths on the fourteeners, usually resulting from falls but occasionally from heart attacks, foul weather, rock slides, or avalanches. Most people who climb fourteeners accept the inherent risks of climbing and follow some [basic rules] (https://14ers.com/safety.php) to try to avoid injury or death.

Many mountaineers would argue that Mount of the Holy Cross is not an ideal first fourteener. There are many other easier fourteeners to climb, with shorter distances and less difficult trails. Tackling an easy fourteener first gives a hiker the opportunity to evaluate their physical condition at altitude and determine whether they are likely to experience AMS.

In some ways, Michelle Vanek did everything right when attempting to climb her first fourteener.  The 35-year-old mother of four was in very good physical condition, a triathlete and marathoner. She asked a friend who had hiked 38 fourteeners, Eric Sawyer, to accompany her. Her clothing for the day was a little light but not necessarily inappropriate for the season - a jacket and pants, a hat and gloves, hiking poles and a CamelBak backpack.  Anyone who hikes regularly has seen people on more difficult hikes who were not as well-equipped. Most who hike fourteeners regularly would carry more clothing and equipment than Michelle carried that day.

Things quickly started to go wrong on the hike. The sign indicating which trail was the easier [North Ridge Route] (http://14ers.com/routemain.php?route=holy1&amp;peak=Mt.+of+the+Holy+Cross) and which trail was the more arduous [Halo Route] (http://14ers.com/routemain.php?route=holy3&amp;peak=Mt.+of+the+Holy+Cross) was reportedly being replaced by park services. At 6:30 AM Eric and Michelle started up the Halo Route, which is sometimes hiked over two days due to its length, distance above treeline, and the up-and-down path of the last few miles.  By the time they realized their mistake, they didn't want to turn back because it would mean failing to summit. They also soon realized that Eric had left their lunches and his water purifier in the car. Eric and Michelle carried no maps, no compass, no GPS, and no personal locator beacon. There is no shortcut down the Halo Ridge Route that doesn't involve climbing over a mountain or taking a very steep off-route slope down.

By the time Eric and Michelle reached the top of Notch Mountain on the way to Holy Cross, Michelle was already slowing.  At the summit of Notch Mountain, Eric Sawyer took [the last known picture of Michelle Vanek.] (http://www.vaildaily.com/apps/pbcs.dll/misc?URL=/global/zoom.pbs&amp;Site=VD&amp;Date=20051208&amp;Category=NEWS&amp;ArtNo=112080048&amp;Ref=AR&amp;s=0&amp;t=0&amp;Z=Michelle%20Vanek%20and%20her%20partner%20made%20%20several%20mistakes%20on%20their%20hike%20of%20Mt.%20of%20the%20Holy%20Cross%2C%20Sept.%2024.&amp;P=)  

By 1:25 PM, Michelle and Eric had run out of water. Michelle and Eric could have replenished their water supplies at the creek near the top of Notch Mountain, but they chose not to due to the lack of a water purifier. Although giardia is a risk in mountain streams, many mountaineers would take that risk rather than hike for several hours without water.

Within half a mile (and 500 feet of altitude gain) of the top of Mount of the Holy Cross, Michelle decided she couldn't finish the hike. She sat down and told Eric to continue to the summit. Any experienced mountaineer [knows that splitting up a hiking party is unwise.] (http://listsofjohn.com/Accidents/HolyCross.html)  Eric disregarded that, and in addition he instructed Michelle to traverse what he estimated to be about 600 feet to the North Ridge Route for an easier descent. Eric hurried to the summit, arriving at 1:42 PM. He called his wife to let her know they were running late, briefly visited with a couple of other hikers and snapped pictures of each other, and after spending a total of five minutes at the summit he headed down the North Ridge Route to meet Michelle.

He never found her. 

Hundreds of mountaineers searched for Michelle for the following week, from dawn until dusk.  The area where Michelle vanished is covered with boulders as large as refrigerators, and it's possible she fell underneath or between a boulder. Another theory suggests that Michelle attempted to descend into the Cross Creek Valley. That area was also searched. The possibility of foul play was explored, as a shotgun was found in a duffel bag on the mountain and there were reports of a suspicious man in the area, but there was not enough evidence to lead to any conclusion. The largest search party in Colorado history was unable to find any sign of Michelle Vanek.

**TL;DR: Mother of four disappeared on mountain almost eight years ago. No trace has ever been found.**

The Roanoke Colony on Roanoke Island in Dare County, present-day North Carolina, United States, was a late 16th-century attempt by Queen Elizabeth I to establish a permanent English settlement. The enterprise was financed and organized originally by Sir Humphrey Gilbert, who drowned in 1583 during an aborted attempt to colonize St. John's, Newfoundland. Sir Humphrey Gilbert's half brother Sir Walter Raleigh would gain his brother's charter from Queen Elizabeth I and subsequently would execute the details of the charter through his delegates Ralph Lane and Richard Grenville, Raleigh's distant cousin.

The final group of colonists disappeared during the Anglo-Spanish War, three years after the last shipment of supplies from England. Their disappearance gave rise to the nickname ""The Lost Colony.

I am of the opinion that the settlers voluntarily decided to integrate themselves with one of the local Native American tribes. Without any supplies for three years, the inhabitants of Roanoke may have felt abandoned and felt that integration was the best means of survival. Additionally, it was not unheard of for early settlers to want to leave settlements and live with the Native American tribes. There are also the anecdotal accounts of Native Americans with lighter color hair and eyes appearing in the area not long after the Roanoke colony disappeared.

Another compelling factor is there were no signs of destruction to the colony. It appeared to have been dismantled in an orderly fashion. This makes some random and sudden event to cause the disappearance unlikely

Despite an extensive manhunt and an ongoing FBI investigation, the perpetrator has never been located or positively identified. The case remains the only unsolved air piracy in American aviation history.

The suspect purchased his airline ticket using the alias Dan Cooper, but due to a news media miscommunication he became known in popular lore as ""D. B. Cooper"". Hundreds of leads have been pursued in the ensuing years, but no conclusive evidence has ever surfaced regarding Cooper's true identity or whereabouts. Numerous theories of widely varying plausibility have been proposed by experts, reporters, and amateur enthusiasts. The discovery of a small cache of ransom bills in 1980 triggered renewed interest but ultimately only deepened the mystery, and the great majority of the ransom remains unrecovered.""

During a 13-month period, four children were abducted and murdered with their bodies left in various locations within the county. The children were each held from 4 to 19 days before being killed. Their deaths triggered a murder investigation which at the time was the largest in US history.  The murders are still unsolved.
Fear and near mass hysteria swept southeastern Michigan as young people were inundated with information on ""stranger danger"", and parents clogged streets around schools dropping off and picking up their children. The few who did walk, walked in groups and under the watchful eyes of parents in ""safe houses"", where children could go if they felt uncomfortable. Children even avoided using a playground directly behind the Birmingham police station.  One incident in Livonia involved a tow-truck driver who assaulted a man he had seen asking two boys on the street for directions. He turned out to be a tire salesman on a business trip from Akron, Ohio, who had gotten lost with no knowledge of the slayings. The Detroit News offered a $100,000 reward for the killer's apprehension. 

Detroit's two daily newspapers, as well as the area's numerous radio and television stations, aggressively covered the case. A presentation on WXYZ, entitled Winter's Fear: The Children, the Killer, the Search, won a 1977 Peabody Award.



**Victims**


**Confirmed**

* Mark Stebbins, 12, of Ferndale, was last seen leaving an American Legion Hall on Sunday afternoon, February 15, 1976. He had told his mother he was going home to watch television. His body was found on February 19, neatly laid out in a snowbank in the parking lot of an office building at Ten Mile Road and Greenfield in Southfield (some reports claim Oak Park; Greenfield is the boundary between the two cities). He had been strangled and sexually assaulted with an object. Rope marks were seen on his wrists. He was fully clothed in the outfit he was wearing when last seen alive.


* Jill Robinson, 12, of Royal Oak, packed a backpack and ran away from her home on Wednesday, December 22, 1976, following an argument with her mother over dinner preparations. The day after her disappearance, her bicycle was found behind a hobby store on Main Street in that city. Her body was found on the morning of December 26, along the side of Interstate 75 near Big Beaver Road in Troy. She was killed by a single shotgun blast to the face. She was fully clothed and still wearing her backpack. The body was placed within sight of the Troy police station, once again, laid out neatly in the snow.


* Kristine Mihelich, 10, of Berkley, was last seen Sunday, January 2, 1977 at 3:00 pm at a 7-Eleven store on Twelve Mile Road at Oakshire in Berkley, purchasing a magazine. A mail carrier spotted her fully clothed body 19 days later on the side of a rural road in Franklin Village. She had been smothered. The body was laid within view of nearby homes, eyes closed and arms folded across the chest, once again in the snow.


* Timothy King, 11, borrowed 30 cents from his older sister and left his home in Birmingham, skateboard in hand, to buy candy at a drugstore on nearby Maple Road on Wednesday, March 16, 1977, at about 8:30 pm He left the store by the rear entrance, which opened to a parking lot shared with a supermarket, and vanished. An intensive search was executed that covered the entire Detroit metropolitan area, and there was widespread media coverage, already heavy with coverage of the previous three slayings. In an emotional television appeal, Timothy's father, Barry King, begged the abductor to release his son unharmed. In a letter printed in the Detroit News, Marion King wrote that she hoped Timothy could come home soon so she could serve him his favorite meal, Kentucky Fried Chicken. In the late evening hours of March 22, 1977, two teenagers in a car spotted his body in a shallow ditch alongside Gill Road, about 300 feet south of Eight Mile Road in Livonia, just across the county line in Wayne County. His skateboard was placed next to his body. His clothing had been neatly pressed and washed. He had been suffocated and sexually assaulted with an object. The postmortem showed that Timothy had eaten fried chicken before he was slain.


**Suspected**

There were other abductions and murders around the Oakland County area within the same period. These are not specifically tied to the four victims above due to variations in the cases.

* Cynthia Cadieux, 16, was abducted and bludgeoned to death on the evening of January 15, 1976. Missing from Roseville, she was discovered nude and battered in Bloomfield Township in the early morning hours of January 16.


**Disproved**

* Sheila Srock, 14, was raped and shot dead while babysitting in a home on Villa Street in Birmingham on January 20, 1976. Her assailant had burglarized several homes in the neighborhood earlier in the evening. A neighbor had watched the entire attack in horror from his roof, where he was shoveling snow. Oliver Rhodes Andrews confessed to, and was convicted of the murder of Srock, and is serving a life sentence in prison.

This video is a recording of a paranormal radio show called Coast to Coast AM, where everything from aliens to government conspiracies are discussed. The video is long, but well worth the listen. 

Every year scores of people go missing in our (U.S./Canada) national forests. Most cases can be chalked up to people getting lost and succumbing to the elements, however, a surprisingly large percentage cannot be explained at all. Experienced adults just disappearing from the trail never to be seen again. Children going missing only to be found miles away, sometimes over mountains or across rivers that would be seemingly impossible for someone that age to endure. Also, the overall lack of aide from the National Parks sparks suspicion as to whether or not they are hiding something. This video is an interview with David Paulides, a man who filled two entire books with not stories but cold hard FACTS about these cases. He gives no speculation as to what he believes is behind all these disappearances, just presents the facts in a way that captures the listeners imagination.

1370265539.0,38,self.UnresolvedMysteries,1fkuob,"The case of Michael Hughes and ""Sharon Marshall""",Countryb0i2m,50,12,2,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/1fkuob/the_case_of_michael_hughes_and_sharon_marshall/,"Michael's case begins with the abduction of his mother, an unidentified woman who authorities believe was kidnapped by Franklin Delano Floyd between June 1973 and August 1975. Photos of Michael's mother and Floyd are posted below this case summary. Floyd claimed that he 'rescued' Michael's mother after her family abandoned her in the 1970's and served as her parent. He has never provided any details about the woman's identity or background, but it is believed she was born around 1969. Inevestigators know that Floyd and the girl traveled to various states and used several aliases together through the 1970's and 1980's. 
The first public record available for the girl states that she was enrolled in an Oklahoma City, Oklahoma school in 1975 under the name Suzanne Davis. Davis graduated from high school in Forest Park, Georgia in 1986. Investigators determined that Davis moved to Phoenix, Arizona later during that year under the name Sharon Marshall. She gave birth to Michael in Tampa, Florida on March 21, 1988 while apparently using the alias Tonya Dawn Tadlock. It is known that Floyd used the aliases Charles Hughes and Clarence Marcus Hughes during this time; authorities believe that this was the reason Michael was given the last name of Hughes at birth. Floyd claimed to be Michael's biological father; however, DNA testing performed in the mid-1990's proved that he was not related to the unidentified woman's son. 

In another bizarre twist, Floyd and Michael's mother were married in New Orleans in 1989 under the names Tonya Tadlock and Clarence Hughes. Both Floyd and the woman were wanted in connection with a Florida homicide by 1990. Before any legal action could be taken against them, the woman was killed in a suspicious hit-and-run vehicular accident in Oklahoma City in April 1990. Floyd is the main suspect in her death. Authorities did not realize the woman's identity was unknown until after she was killed; only then did it come to public attention that Floyd abducted her years earlier. 

Michael was placed in foster care in Oklahoma after his mother's death. His foster parents told authorities that he had limited muscle control, was non-verbal and often exhibited hysterical behavior when he first arrived at their home. However, Michael apparently made great progress in foster care before his abduction in 1994, and his foster parents had begun adoption proceedings for him. 

Investigators began probing Floyd's background after the girl's death. They learned he was a career criminal who had been arrested in 1960 at age 17 after a gunfight with law enforcement during a burglary. Floyd had also been convicted of abducting and raping a young girl from a bowling alley in 1962. Authorities searched Floyd's truck and discovered numerous photos of Michael's mother as a child in sexually explicit poses. The photos showed the girl from approximately age four through her adolescence. Other pornographic images of young women and girls were also located in Floyd's vehicle. Floyd used the aliases Trenton Davis, Warren Judson Marshall, Preston Morgan and Kingfish Floyd in addition to the names previously mentioned in his criminal past. 

Floyd abducted Michael from Indian Meridian Elementary School in Choctaw, Oklahoma on September 12, 1994. He held school officials at gunpoint and forced Michael and the principal into his truck. Floyd tied the principal to a tree in a nearby field and escaped with Michael. The principal was rescued several hours later and was not physically harmed. Michael has never been seen again. 

Floyd was arrested in Kentucky two months after the child was last seen, but he refused to divulge Michael's whereabouts. He was convicted of Michael's kidnapping and was sentenced to 55 years in prison. Floyd has claimed that Michael is living outside the United States or in Atlanta, Georgia, but the government has witness statements detailing alleged confessions by Floyd regarding Michael's death. Floyd reportedly told his sister he drowned the child in a Georgia motel's bathtub in 1994. Other witnesses stated that Floyd told them he murdered Michael in the same manner, while another person claimed he saw Floyd bury Michael's body in a cemetery. Due to these allegations and Floyd's history of criminal conduct, authorities believe Michael met with foul play. Floyd has not been charged in connection with Michael's assumed death or Michael's mother's case, but he is still being investigated for his roles in the crimes.

She was last seen by family members sitting on the balcony outside their cabin aboard the Rhapsody of the Seas cruise ship. The ship was en route to Curacao, Antilles at the time Amy was last seen. The ship docked in Curacao shortly after Amy was discovered missing. Extensive searches on the ship and at sea produced no signs of Amy's whereabouts.
 
In 1999 American sailor reported that he went to a brothel on Curacao and saw Amy Bradley. She asked him for help, told him her name. She said, ""My name is Amy Bradley. Please help me."" He told her there was a naval ship five minutes down the dock that she could leave. And she said, ""No, you don't understand. Please help me. My name is Amy Bradley."" At that time, two men in the bar removed her, told her to move and go upstairs.

Tara's mother located part of her Sony Walkman and a Boston cassette tape along her bicycle route. Some witnesses observed a ford pickup truck following her.

On June 15, 1989, a [Polaroid photo](http://mysteriebloggen.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/calico1.jpg)
 of an unidentified young girl and boy, both bound and gagged, was found in the parking lot of a convenience store in Port St. Joe, Florida. It was theorized that the girl in the photo was Tara and that the boy was Michael Henley, also of New Mexico, who had disappeared in April 1988. The theory that the boy was Michael Henley was later dismissed when his remains were located near the mountains where he'd disappeared and the cause of death was determined as exposure.

Two other Polaroid photographs, possibly of Tara, have surfaced over the years, but they have yet to be released to the public.

Twenty years after her disappearance, Rene Rivera, sheriff of Valencia County, announced that he knew what happened to Tara Calico. According to Rivera, boys who knew her from school drove up behind her in a truck and some form of accident followed. Tara later died and those responsible covered up the crime. Rivera states he knows the names of those involved, but that, without a body, he cannot make a case. He has not released whatever evidence has led him to this conclusion. No arrests have been made and the case remains open.[3] Tara's stepfather, John Doel, said that the sheriff should not have made these comments if he was not willing to arrest anyone and said that strong circumstantial evidence should be enough for a conviction.

The [crimelibrary website](http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/blog/article/girl-in-the-photograph-the-tara-calico-story/index.html) also contains a detailed account of the case.

Johnny went missing while on his paper route in 1982. The mother claims he was sold into a sex ring, escaped, and visited her under an assumed identity. There are a lot of websites out there about this, but here's the Wikipedia. Thoughts?

http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Gosch

ETA: in 2006 the mother received pictures of boys tied up, one of which she insisted was Johnny. From the article:


On September 1, 2006, CNN reported that Gosch's mother found photographs left at her front door, some of which she posted on her website. One color photo shows three boys bound and gagged. A black-and-white photo] appears to show 12-year-old Johnny Gosch with his mouth gagged, his hands and feet tied, and an apparent human brand on his shoulder. A third photo shows a man, possibly dead, who may have something tied around his neck.[12] Ms. Gosch explains that the man was alleged to be one of the ""perpetrators who molested [my] son"".[13]


Ms. Gosch updated her site to say that the first two photos had originated on a website, and police confirmed this fact. Some of these pictures have since been removed.[13]


The identity of the children in the photos was first publicly disputed on September 13, after an anonymous letter was mailed to Des Moines police.


Gentlemen,
Someone has played a reprehensible joke on a grieving mother. The photo in question is not one of her son but of three boys in Tampa, Florida about 1979-80, challenging each other to an escape contest. There was an investigation concerning that picture, made by the Hillsborough County (FL) Sheriff's Office. No charges were filed, and no wrongdoing was established. The lead detective on the case was named Zalva. This allegation should be easy enough to check out.[13]

There is one detail, though, that many have not heard of and is often overlooked: The Babushka Lady. The Babushka Lady was an attendee of the parade the day that Kennedy was assassinated, and is seen in many films (including the Zapruder Film) holding a camera and taking pictures. She is named ""babushka"" for the shawl or headscarf that she was wearing that day as seen in the films. It is believed that she could possibly have taken pictures of the grassy knoll and other areas where a second gunman could have been hiding, had there been one. The Babushka Lady was asked to reveal herself and turn over her film for review by the FBI and police, however her identity remains anonymous to this day and her film was never recovered, supposedly. In 1970, a woman named Beverly Oliver came forward claiming to be the Babushka Lady, but many inconsistencies with both her story and the details of the day result in nearly unanimous agreement that she is not the Babushka Lady. Beverly Oliver did claim, however, that after the assassination, she was contacted by two men who she thought were FBI and they asked to borrow her film for review, promising to return it within 10 days. She says it was never returned to her. One last detail of the mystery of the Babushka Lady revolves around a man named Jack Harrison, a Kodak film technician, who claimed to have developed on the day of the assassination a blurred color slide of film depicting the area in front of the Babushka Lady, who he described as a woman that fit the description of the lady.  

The most chilling realization with the whole Babushka Lady Mystery is that if ever her film is revealed, we might actually know the truth of whether Oswald acted alone, with others, or if he was framed, thus solving one of the most famous mysteries in American History.

Irwin said that when he got home from working overnight, one of the front windows was damaged, the front door was unlocked, many of the lights were on inside the house and the couple's cell phones were gone. And Lisa was missing from her crib.

Her mother initially said she checked on her in her crib around 10:30 p.m. on October 3. In media interviews a couple of weeks later, Bradley said that she had ""drunk enough to be drunk"" that night and doesn't remember seeing Lisa after putting her to bed around 6:40 p.m.

Attorneys have released a long list of things the parents have done to assist the investigation, but police say they haven't agreed to separate, unrestricted interviews with detectives since October 8. Family attorney Joe Tacopina told ABC the parents do not want to sit down with the same detectives who he claims accused Bradley of murdering Lisa hours after they reported her missing.

A couple living a few houses away from Lisa's parents reported seeing a man carrying a baby in a diaper around 12:15 am on October 4. About four hours later, Mike Thompson saw a man walking with a baby three miles away. The man who Thompson identified in a photo line-up lives in the area. That man has denied to CNN’s Jim Spellman that he was the person Thompson saw. Police have interviewed these witnesses and followed hundreds of other leads. It is unclear how much credence they are giving any of them.

Early in the investigation, police said they were looking for a homeless man who did handiwork in Lisa's parents' neighborhood and had not been seen since she disappeared. He was referred to by the nickname ""Jersey"" but he was later identified as John Tanko. Tanko's ex-girlfriend, Megan Wright, said that a 50-second phone call was made from Deborah Bradley's missing cell phone to her phone around 8 or 8:30 p.m. on October 3. Wright said she did not answer that call, but several other people also use her phone. Tanko has not been named as a suspect or person of interest in the case.

There are so many unanswered questions surrounding this case. 
Who made that call and why? Where are the missing cell phones? Who turned on the lights in the house and tampered with the window? Why won't the parents talk to the police separately? And most importantly, what happened to Baby Lisa?

It should also be noted that in May of 2012, Deborah Bradley and Jeremy Irwin reported that their debit card had been fraudulently used on a website that provides false birth certificates.... when did they discover they were missing a debit card? Did they report it missing along with the cell phones? Or was it only when they noticed a fraudulent charge on it?

I've always suspected there was more than one letter writer involved seeing as the prime suspect actually received taunting and harassing letters himself while he was incarcerated for attempted murder.

James is careful with his words, but he maintains that someone is ""shrouding and manufacturing evidence"" in what he says was at first an effort to keep the two older girls away. Now he thinks only Rachel survives. He is evasive about what he thinks happened or who he believes can be held accountable.

&gt;""I believe that that person facilitates and maintains an effort to keep Rachel Arnold [Trlica] away from Fort Worth. I believe that Renee Wilson is not alive. . . . I believe that something dreadfully wrong, and probably a fatality, occurred involving Julie Ann Moseley,"" he says.

&gt;Rusty buys James' deductions, but neatly sidesteps on-the-record comments himself. Yes, he has a theory. No, he won't discuss it, except to say that ""someone close to one of the girls had something to do with the disappearance."" 

&gt;Debra is more candid. ""I know he blames me. I know he thinks I had something to do with it. . . . Rusty thinks this letter that Tommy got the next day - he thinks I wrote it. . . . I didn't write this letter. I don't know who did. I don't know what happened to my sister. Maybe white slavery. That's the only thing that makes sense to me,"" she says. ""I have nothing to hide.""

His family have been actively searching for him ever since, and there has been amassed an almost paralysing weight of rumours, suggestions, tips and possible leads (though very little hard evidence), with the most common theory being that he was killed by a local drug dealer for some reason. There is a £20,000 reward out for information that leads to him being found, but it seems even this isn't enough to get people talking. There were some arrests in 2011, but all the suspects were released without being charged. The whole affair has given rise to a number of conspiracy theories, such as the idea that the police covered up his murder so that it wouldn't negatively impact local tourism.

Betsy Aardsma was a Penn State grad student who was stabbed in the heart by an unknown person in November of 1969. It is believed that a minute or two after the stabbing occurred, a male walked by the desk clerk and told her ""you better help that girl"", referring to Betsy. No information is known about those men, and in fact, the Police and EMS people on scene did not realize she was stabbed until her body was examined at the local hospital, as the stab mark was so small and the bleeding was mainly internal.

One of the articles linked in the works cited section for the Wikipedia article mentions that the area of the library she was stabbed in was known for strange behaviors, such as sex and drug use, so some have speculated that played a role in the stabbing. But forty-years-plus on, there still appear to be no solid leads in the case.

These artifacts came to wider attention in 1938 when Wilhelm König, the German director of the National Museum of Iraq, found the objects in the museum's collections. In 1940, König published a paper speculating that they may have been galvanic cells, perhaps used for electroplating gold onto silver objects.[2][3] Though far from settled, this interpretation continues to be considered as at least a hypothetical possibility.[4] If correct, the artifacts would predate Alessandro Volta's 1800 invention of the electrochemical cell by more than a millennium.[2]

One night, a miner came in to have some whiskey and she noticed he was paying for it with gold coins he pulled out of a leather sack; she concluded that there must be several hundred dollars worth of gold in it, she got an idea. 

After he was sufficiently drunk, she lured him into an empty room where her son killed him with an ax and she took the bag of gold. After everybody left, her son took the body and dumped it into an abandoned mine shaft. This behavior resumed for many years, and the total estimated amount of victims she had was 30.

The gold was never deposited in a bank, nor did she arouse suspiscion by living above the status she portrayed to the community. She hid the gold somewhere in Galena, and to this day, it has not been found.

Israel Keyes is a modern serial killer who committed suicide while in police custody. Before he committed suicide, he told police of some of his handiwork, but didn't give all the details of each murder. 

As Slate's Crime Blog notes, he was a rather meticulous killer flying into cities, renting a car and driving to another city to select his victim and kill them. He would then dispose of the bodies in yet another city thus spreading his crimes across many jurisdictions.

Now, the FBI has released a timeline of his criminal activity and is requesting public assistance to help identify and/or locate some of Keyes' alleged victims.

Anyhow, below is a little copy paste from the article:

&gt;With the use of sonar, oceanographer Dr. Meyer Verlag discovered giant glass pyramids at a depth of two-thousand meters.  The use of other devices have allowed scientists to determine that these glass giants are both made of a crystal-like substance, and are nearly 3 times bigger than the pyramid of Cheops in Egypt.

&gt;Dr. Verlag believes that further investigation into the secrets in the the pyramids center could reveal more information regarding the cases of mysterious disappearances associated with the Bermuda Triangle.  In a press conference held in the Bahamas, the scientist presented a report with the exact coordinates of the pyramids, and made note that the technology at use is unknown to modern science.  A more detailed study may bring results that are difficult for us to imagine.  Who knows what will be discovered about these underwater architectural anomalies – perhaps something of shocking significance.

&gt;**Built on Land – Lost During Last Pole Shift?**
There are several Western scholars who argue that the pyramid on the seabed may have been initially made on the mainland, after which a devastating earthquake struck and changed the landscape completely. Other scientists argue that a few hundred years ago the waters of the Bermuda Triangle area may have as one of the cornerstone activities of the people of Atlantis, and Pyramids on the sea floor may be a supply warehouse for them.

&gt;A more detailed study over time will give results that are difficult to imagine. Scientists have processed all of the data and concluded that the surface is perfectly smooth for it to look like glass or ice. The size of the pyramids are nearly three times the size of the pyramids of Cheops. This news was sensational, and was discussed at a conference in Florida and even reported to local Florida newspapers.. The journalists present in it, have a lot of pictures and high resolution computerized data, which show three-dimensional pyramids perfectly smooth, without being covered with a surface free of debris or algae or cracks.

&gt;The Vela Incident — sometimes referred to as the South Atlantic Flash — was an unidentified ""double flash"" of light that was detected by an American Vela Hotel satellite on September 22, 1979 near the Prince Edward Islands or Antarctica. There is uncertainty as to the true nature of the flash though it is widely believed to have been the result of a nuclear detonation.

&gt;While a ""double flash"" signal is characteristic of a nuclear weapons test, the signal might have been a spurious electronic signal that was generated by an aging detector in an old satellite or a meteoroid hitting the Vela satellite. No corroboration of an explosion, such as the presence of nuclear byproducts in the air, was ever publicly acknowledged, even though there were numerous passes in the area by U.S. Air Force planes that were specifically designed to detect airborne radioactive dust. Other examiners of the data, including the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (NRL), and defense contractors, have come to the conclusion that the flash was a result of a nuclear detonation. Much of the information relating to the event remains classified.

&gt;The most widespread theory among those who believe that the flash was of nuclear origins was that it resulted from a joint South African and Israeli nuclear test. The topic remains highly disputed today.

So much about this case is fascinating - the identity of the killer aside, the fact that there were several imposters sending letters into the press, or perhaps in some cases it was the press themselves who were forging the letters to drum-up publicity and sales. The levels of sensationalism was incredible. 

It's pretty-much certain that the ripper's identity will never be discovered now, but what a fascinating mystery....

This one is suspected to be ""everywhere"". 

During the years of 1992 and 1993, 3 prostitutes in the Portuguese capital Lisbon were found gruesomely murdered. 
The first victim, of alias ""Tina"" ,22, was found strangled and disemboweled and with mutilated genitals. The second victim Maria Fernanda, again strangled and disemboweled.The last identified victim was found 100m from the place of the first victom, again strangled and disemboweled but in this case all the organs were removed, lungs, vagina, heart, liver. 

No evidence related to the killer was found in any of the crime sites, all the blood (a lot of it) belonged to the victim. A coroner office stated that all the victims were alive during the disembowelment but unconscious due to strangling and blunt force trauma to the head. 

Later, in New Bedford, the FBI suspected some  murders were possibly connected to this case since the largest Portuguese community in US is there but found it difficult to establish the connection. 

Between 1993 and 1997, similar crimes occurred in Netherlands, Czech Republic, Denmark and Belgium and the European authorities suspect he might have become a long distance truck driver. (Translation, Pt wiki).

In 2011, a certain ""José Guedes"" confessed to the crimes but was revealed to be a bad joke or Hoax for fame. This person remains under custody due the suspected killing of another person.

One of the housemates saw Marble answer the door at around 2 p.m., but didn’t recognize the visitor. Marble had made a date with his girlfriend for 4 that afternoon, so, before leaving with the visitor, he left a note for his housemates saying he’d be back in about 20 minutes. He never returned."" This is an interesting case for me, not only because I knew Marble and his mother (years before his disappearance), but also because the details are so intriguing. There is a lot of speculation that he was injured in the storm, however the storm really didn't pick up until a day after he went missing, so it being the initial cause of his disappearance seems off to me. And of course, there are these reports of a mystery man meeting up with him. Anyway, I'm interested in hearing what you guys think.

 It has been 61 years since Detroit, Michigan, businessmen Al Jones and Charles Culhane walked into Crater Lake National Park and never walked out.

Their bodies were found gagged and shot through the head. Their cash, watches and shoes were stolen. Investigators found no evidence at the scene.

Alan Eberlien was at the park when the murders happened. His father sold parts for United Motors, the same company that Jones and Culhane worked for. They flew in, did their business with Eberlien’s father, and were set to meet the Eberliens again at Union Creek. But their 1951 Pontiac never made it that far.

“*We figured they were probably just sight-seeing around here*,” said Eberlien. “*Maybe had looked here and walked up the canyon a ways to take a look. And so we waited for about 45 minutes and they didn’t come back.*”

While his father went to the park’s south entrance to launch the search that led to the bodies of Jones and Culhane two days later, Eberlien sat in the businessmen’s car. He saw another car come up beside him, pause, and speed away.

“*When the car sped off, I turned around to see what it was*,” Eberlien said. “*All I could see was the tree. I never could see the car. All I saw was a black fender disappear behind the tree.*”

The park was nearly empty, Eberlien said. He’s convinced the car belonged to the murderers.

Former Crater Lake National Park Lodge employee Lincoln Linse agrees.

Linse said he drove a truck loaded with canned goods up the steep dirt highway when he saw the Pontiac. He said he saw an abduction; four men disappeared into the woods. Two of them were dressed like businessmen.

He saw the other two men the next day.

“*I pulled in to the service station on the inside of the pumps and shortly after that, this car with the two men pulled in on the other side of me*,” said Linse.

“*I could tell he had a tattoo on his arm. The tattoo was of a naked lady with a bikini*,” Linse said. “*Also at that time, he had a beaded belt. There was a name on the beaded belt: Ralph*.”

The FBI discredited Linse as a witness in the case. Linse said his friend at the service station wouldn’t corroborate his story.

There was another hole. The overlook where Jones and Culhane’s car was found abandoned was about one mile from where their bodies were found.

**Serial killer’s alibi**

The FBI investigated serial killer Jack Santo.

“*The modus operandi of the Santos gang was always robbery, and generally they gagged their victims before they shot them*,” said Eberlien.

Santo had an alibi putting him in California at the time, but Eberlien said two known Santo associates were staying near Crater Lake.

Santo and his gang were convicted of a murder in California and executed at San Quentin. The FBI never named them suspects in the Crater Lake murders. Then the case went cold.

KATU called the FBI in Portland to get some of the documents they have on this case. A spokesperson told us they weren’t sure whether their file on the murders still exists. KATU is using the Freedom of Information Act to try and find that file.

Now, 61 years later, the same questions linger. Eberlien admits those questions may never be answered.

When they didn't return right away to their destination, nothing was suspected, since several day hikes like these were often are delayed. Eventually, the families of the hikers started to worry, and alerted the authorities. A search party was formed, and when they found their campsite, the tent was torn open and the bodies of all 9 were found in various locations not too far away. One woman had her tongue cut off, other had skull injuries, and bone fractures, no internal damage though. A few of the bodies were found in a nearby ravine. At first, it was thought the local Mansi people did this, but that theory was scrapped after it was concluded no human force could of caused trauma that big.

About 10 minutes later, there was a flash and a sound similar to artillery fire. Eyewitnesses closer to the explosion reported the sound source moving east to north. The sounds were accompanied by a shock wave that knocked people off their feet and broke windows hundreds of kilometres away. The majority of witnesses reported only the sounds and the tremors, not the sighting of the explosion. Eyewitness accounts differ as to the sequence of events and their overall duration.

The event took place on June 30th, 1908 and is the largest impact in recorded history. The blasts power was estimed to be equal to about thirty megatons of TNT. It knocked down some 80 million trees and created a quake that would have measured a 5.0 on the Richter scale.

The Russian natives, Eveniks, that lived near Lake Baikal witnessed a blue column of light, as bright as the sun, run accross the sky. Approxamately ten minutes later they heard what sounded like artillery and were knocked to the ground by a blast. The blast broke windows over one hundred miles away. It also created atmospheric pressure changes that were detected in Great Britain. For a few days after the blast the skies above both Europe and Asia glowed and the Smithsonian Observatory in the US saw that the atmosphere of Earth had become more transparent.

Expedition records of the blast area were lost during the choas caused by the Russian Civil War and Revolution if there were any at all. The first recorded exploration of the area was by a mineralogist by the name of Leonid Kulik in 1921. Kulik could find no main impact site/crater but did find many holes in the ground which he theorized were meteorite impacts but the claims were laster disproven. 

Expeditions in the 1950's and 1960's found high levels of nitrogen in the soil which was supposedly caused by acid rain that occured post-blast. They also discovered strange levels of isotopes in bogs near the epicenter of the blast.

The Scientific community has come forward with an array of possible casues for the blast the most widely accepted being an air blast caused by asteriod that entered unusually far into the Earth's atmosphere and exploded some 6-11 kilometers above the forest. Though little evidence supports this theory.

Fang Lin went missing in April, 2011. Her purple Porsche Cayenne was found in the parking lot of a plaza at 420 Highway 7 East. A bus would regularly pick people up from that parking lot to take them to the casino.

Fang Lin had access to large sums of money and she ""lent"" it to ""business associates""

She left behind a husband and 14-year old son.

Ms. Lin was a regular at Ontario and Quebec casinos where she spent time in the VIP sections.
